Heavy rains have caused severe flooding along Cambodia’s Mekong and Basak rivers in nearly the entire eastern part of the country, destroying rice fields and wrecking homes and other structures, according to government sources.



Meanwhile, drought in the northern and southern parts of the impoverished country also threatens harvests as farmers struggle to find water to irrigate their crops, the sources said.



The flooding, which began in July and has continued through August, has affected 12 provinces and led to 45 deaths, one government official told RFA’s Khmer Service this week.



“It has now been confirmed that 45 people have been killed,” said Vice Chairman for Cambodia’s National Committee for Disaster Management Nhim Vanda.



The southern province of Prey Veng has seen the largest number of deaths, with neighboring Kampong Cham coming in second, Vanda said, adding that two of the 45 who died were killed by snakebite.



Other affected provinces include Preah Vihear, Kampong Thom, Ratanakiri, Strung Treng, Kratie, Tbong Khmum, Kandal, Svay Rieng, Kampot, and Mondulkiri, Vanda said.



Widespread damage



Reports show that the flooding over the last two months has affected about 100,000 families and 60,000 houses and flooded about 80,000 rice fields, with an estimated 9,000 hectares (22,240 acres) of rice and 10,000 hectares (24,710 acres) of plantations destroyed, Vanda said.



Additionally, 396 schools, 154 pagodas, and 32 hospitals have been flooded, he said.



Vanda declined to give a figure for estimated financial losses from the flooding, but voiced concern over possible damage resulting from further storms and rain.



“It is very hard now to take care of our children, and even of our livestock,” a villager in southern Cambodia’s Prey Veng province said, describing the hardships caused by the floods.



“The flooding has lasted for almost three months now, and I am scared my children may drown,” the villager, Phan Vai, told RFA.



Cambodian Red Cross senior official Uy Samath said that the Red Cross has so far helped about 13,000 families affected by the floods, providing emergency aid including rice, instant noodles, canned fish, and temporary shelters.



“I think we have more people to help—especially those living along the Mekong river and in Preah Vihear and Kampong Thom and along the Tonle Sap,” he said.

Meanwhile, drought in other parts of Cambodia—including the provinces of Oddar Meanchey in the north and Takeo in the south—has also threatened crops, with rice-growing areas left without adequate water, sources said.



Oddar Meanchey agriculture official Kam Vuthythun said that about 5,000 hectares (12,355 acres) of rice are now at risk in the northern province, adding, “If there is rain, we might be able to save the rice. Without rain, it will be destroyed.”



Water sources have also been hard to find in recent days in the province of Kompong Speu and in parts of Takeo and the province of Kampot, Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen was quoted saying by The Cambodia Daily last week.



“Our citizens face twin problems—one is from floods and one is from droughts,” Hun Sen said.

3,3,FL-2014-000117-BGD,Climate change: adapt now or perish - Livemint,https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/FF2CtAZCyT6W9XbflxaYuM/South-Asia-adapt-now-or-perish.html,"Climate change will sow confusion and concern as it unfolds across South Asia in coming decades. Home to a quarter of the world’s population, this vast region will be hit harder than just about anywhere else. Sudden flooding, storms, droughts and other hazards will upend lives, livelihoods, and economies.

As this grim future takes shape, the price of global inaction is rising each year. Up to 9% will have been stripped annually from South Asia’s economy on average by 2100 if no further action is taken globally on climate change, says a new report by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Assessing the Costs of Climate Change and Adaptation in South Asia. There’s an outside chance of those losses blowing out to 24% given the uncertainty surrounding climate change’s future impacts.

What can be done? The region’s countries have taken steps to cushion the impact of a warming world, but bolder action is needed. Given the slow pace of global mitigation efforts, the worst-case scenario of huge economic losses might end up being South Asia’s future by default.

While only global action will halt climate change, countries should not wait on it before taking adaptive measures. They can be as straightforward as placing sand-filled geotextile bags along riverbanks to stall erosion as happened recently in low-lying Bangladesh, where an area up to twice the size of Shimla city is swallowed annually. Or they can be more wide-ranging, such as a recent initiative of the UK government, the Rockefeller Foundation and ADB to boost climate resilience at 25 cities in Asia by helping to integrate climate risks into city plans and develop resilient infrastructure.

Those efforts must now be mainstreamed into national development plans, with governments, the private sector and civil society working together. Moreover, as climate change ignores national borders, South Asia’s countries must respond cooperatively through a regional framework to promote technology transfer, dialogue, and sharing of best practices.

The sooner this happens, the better. Though some areas may benefit temporarily from a see-sawing climate, overall it will be very bad news for South Asia’s 1.5 billion people if nothing is done globally. Maldives and Nepal would lose 12.6% and 9.9% of their economies, respectively, each year by 2100. Losses in Bangladesh would tally 9.4%, India 8.7%, Bhutan 6.6% and Sri Lanka 6.5%.

But the damage would be significantly less if global action is taken on climate change, with just 2.5% culled from the region’s potential gross domestic product by the end of the century.

Obviously this best-case scenario is preferable, particularly in South Asia which due to its geography, huge population and widespread poverty faces acute climate risks. Extreme weather events will become a more destructive fact of life. Droughts will be longer and more intense, while storm surges from rising sea-levels and floods from heavier rain will be constant threats. Flooding will also occur as lakes formed by melting glaciers burst their banks, and frequent landslides will dump debris into rivers, endangering lives and infrastructure.

This will make it tougher for South Asia’s economies to achieve rapid growth, but the human toll is even more alarming. Those likely to suffer most are the 600 million South Asians living in absolute poverty—more than half the world’s total poor. Escaping from poverty will become an even more daunting challenge, as many poor people depend for their livelihoods on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture, forestry and traditional fishing.

Nearly half of India’s 29 states are vulnerable to sea level rise. Gujarat and West Bengal would be inundated for varying periods, while 10% of Maharashtra’s population would be affected by encroaching waters. Storms and rising sea levels will sharpen risks of flooding at heavily populated mega-deltas.

Across the subcontinent, impacts will include patchier energy supply and higher electricity bills, erosion and reduced household water stocks. Hard-hit communities may have to relocate to survive.

These are just some of the climate shocks that will jolt South Asia in coming years. Just how hard they hit will depend, to a degree, on global action—or lack thereof—on climate change. But that only makes the case even more compelling for better climate change adaptation. Just a few of the many adaptive options available include using drought, flood and salt-resistant crop varieties, reforming water policy, and building better drainage systems.

And the time for action is now. Because the longer South Asia waits to step up its adaptive response, the more it will cost.

If temperatures and sea-levels rise appreciably amid global inaction, the annual average cost of climate change adaptation could hit $73 billion between now and 2100, but only $41 billion under a more optimistic scenario. Upgrading adaptation from today will make the cost more manageable, no matter what happens globally.

South Asia has made huge strides recently in boosting prosperity and reducing poverty. It would be a tragedy if climate change were allowed to roll back those gains.

6,6,FL-2014-000117-BGD,Three dead and hundreds injured as Islamabad protests turn violent - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/31/islamabad-protests-violent-injured,"Anti-government protesters forced their way into the grounds of Pakistan's parliament on Saturday amid violent clashes that saw police fire teargas and rubber bullets at crowds demanding the prime minister's resignation.

Three people died and more than 400 people were injured during clashes that broke out after the followers of former cricket star Imran Khan and Pakistani-Canadian cleric Tahir-ul-Qadri began moving towards key government buildings in the heart of Islamabad.

Associated Press quoted a hospital official, Dr Wasim Khawaja, as saying that one protester, Naveed Razzaq, drowned in a ditch when the crowd was bombarded with tear gas.

Thousands of protesters had besieged the sensitive area for nearly two weeks after the government deliberately chose not to use force to prevent them entering the high-security ""red zone"" of the capital.

But police were finally compelled to respond after protesters attempted to use a crane to remove sea containers placed to block access to official buildings in the area, including the residence of the prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who was not in the capital at the time.

Despite the presence of more than 30,000 security forces, the protesters, armed with hammers and cutting tools, eventually succeeded in using a truck to ram open gates outside Pakistan's imposing Parliament House, allowing people to flood on to the expansive lawns. The crowds did not attempt to enter the building itself after finding the entrance blocked by a large group of soldiers.

More than 400 people, including women, children and police officers were admitted to two government hospitals, Associated Press reported. The injured had wounds from tear gas shells, batons and rubber bullets, said Dr Javed Akram, who heads the capital's main hospital. He said 37 police officers were among the injured.

Protesters started regrouping at daybreak on Sunday and made repeated attempts to break through the heavy deployment of police and barricades to reach the premier's residence, AP reported. Police strengthened their lines and responded by lobbing tear gas canisters.

Despite the continued presence of protesters in the grounds of parliament the government announced on Sunday that a joint session of the National Assembly would be held on Tuesday.

But with Khan sticking to his demands it remained unclear how the crisis would be resolved, with a growing band of pessimists predicting the army will pressure the prime minister to resign.

On Sunday, the army chief called a meeting of the country's most senior generals to discuss the crisis.

Khan also called on his supporters to ""come out on the streets"" in other cities around the country.

In recent days, Khan and Qadri had both threatened to try to push into the state buildings unless their demands for Sharif to stand down were met. They had also insisted that their supporters would remain peaceful, but many of them carried bamboo staves and had become prepared with eye protection and rudimentary gas masks.

Although both men had promised to lead from the front, with Khan even claiming he would ""take the first bullet"", they both stayed back, with Khan remaining inside a specially converted sea container that he has occupied throughout the protests.

Khan, the leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, described the police action against the crowd as illegal. ""Now we will show this government. We will call for countrywide agitation and we will jam the whole of Pakistan,"" he said.

Khan is ostensibly protesting against what he claims was industrial-scale rigging in last year's general elections, although no independent watchdog has supported his allegations. Qadri, a cleric whose own political party has no seats in parliament, has said he wants a ""green revolution"" that will sweep away a democratic order he claims is inherently corrupt.

But in recent days, his demands have focused on a criminal investigation into the prime minister and other senior leaders over the killing of at least 10 of his supporters during confrontations with police in Lahore in June.

The desire to avoid a similar deadly confrontation made the government deeply reluctant to use force against Khan and Qadri when they first entered Islamabad after a ""long march"" from the city of Lahore on 15 August. Serious violence could force an intervention by Pakistan's powerful military, which has repeatedly ousted civilian governments – a move many analysts believe Khan and Qadri had hoped to provoke.

The military, which has fought bruising policy battles with the government over the last year, has already taken a central role in the saga after army chief General Raheel Sharif held a late-night meeting with Khan and Qadri on Thursday.

But the discussions failed to create a breakthrough, with Khan returning to address his supporters with a promise that he would not end his protest until Sharif resigned.

On Saturday, the government insisted that Sharif would not step down despite the scenes in the capital and outbreaks of violence in other cities in the country.

Late on Saturday night, the country's defence minister said the protesters would not be allowed to continue and would be cleared.

Other political parties have generally supported Sharif during the drawn-out crisis. But the opposition Pakistan People's party said it ""strongly condemned"" the police crackdown, while the leader of the Muttahida Quami Movement announced a ""day of mourning"" and demanded Sharif's resignation.","Sun, 31 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/31/1409441098874/Protests-Islamabad-arrest-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=eaff11ee59c9dfa9df0e91dac978c862,"['party', 'minister', 'sharif', 'protesters', 'violent', 'parliament', 'tear', 'protests', 'qadri', 'injured', 'islamabad', 'dead', 'supporters', 'turn', 'hundreds', 'prime', 'khan']",

10,10,FL-2014-000117-BGD,Climate change: Rising sea levels pose salt threat in Vietnam - The Straits Times,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/climate-change-rising-sea-levels-pose-salt-threat-in-vietnam,"HANOI - Pham Thi Ly buys fresh water every 10 days from a well operator in another commune during the dry season.

To ensure her children have clean drinking water, she has to buy the bottled stuff. The dry season typically runs for four months and this buying of water puts a dent into whatever she earns from fishing.

But Mrs Ly has no choice - there is no fresh water to be had as the groundwater under the Thua Duc Commune in Vietnam's southern Ben Tre province has become too salty for daily use.

Mr Tran Thai Hoc, a commune official, said contamination goes back at least five years. Salt concentrations in the groundwater have been measured up to 3:1,000, he said, far higher than Health Ministry guidelines which stipulate that salt concentration levels must be less than 0.3 per thousand to be safe for daily use.

Scientists say rising sea levels, a fallout of climate change, endanger not only people who live on the coasts but also those farther inland as salt water seeps into fresh water sources, rendering them unfit for human use. That, in turn, has the potential to wreak havoc on agriculture and the economy.

About 100,000ha of farmland in the Mekong delta, Vietnam's rice hub, have been affected by saline water intrusion, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

The Vietnamese Mekong delta covers about 39,000km of fertile and alluvial plains and is home to more than 18 million people. Groundwater is among the most important sources of drinking water for millions of people, particularly those living in coastal areas.

According to Mr Nguyen Van Dong, director of southern Ha Giang province's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, salt water intrusion and drought in the delta are threatening farm output. Rice crops die if the salt water concentration in padi fields rises too high.

In some areas, salt water has intruded up to 60km upstream into local rivers. Desperate for fresh water, poorer residents buy anything from well operators not minding whether the water they buy is clean, as long as it is useable.

""This increases the chance of people getting diseases,"" said Mr Nguyen Quoc Thai, a doctor from the Department of Infectious Disease at Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi.

Saline water intrusion is not the only problem that many Vietnamese people face as climate change takes its toll on the country.

The number of severe typhoons has been rising in recent years, while the storm season has been ending later than before.

""The weather tends to be more extreme with storms appearing sooner, stronger every year. In general, the intensity of the storms, measured by wind speed, is believed to have increased by 2 to 11 per cent,"" said Mr Nguyen Van Tue, head of the Department of Meteorology and Climate Change under the Ministry of National Resources and Environment.

Official figures show that in the last 10 years, natural disasters have killed some 9,500 people and caused damage equivalent to 1.5 per cent of the nation's gross domestic product.

In 2012, 10 storms claimed the lives of 258 people in Vietnam, while the damage wrought amounted to 16 trillion dong (S$960 million).

Last year alone, natural calamities claimed the lives of 264 people, injured 800 and caused 25 trillion dong worth of damage. More than 12,000 houses were destroyed and over 300,000ha of farmland devastated.

Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development Cao Duc Phat, who is also the head of the country's Committee for Flood Prevention steering committee, says natural disasters have become increasingly unpredictable and more extreme.

The National Strategy on Climate Change, which was issued by Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung in 2011, categorised Vietnam as one of the countries most affected by climate change, with its Mekong delta listed among the three deltas most vulnerable to rising sea levels (alongside the Nile delta in Egypt and the Ganges delta in Bangladesh).

Mr Pham Anh Dung, a resident of a coastal town in southern Bac Lieu province, says he knows little of the term ""climate change"", but is certain the weather is changing.

""In recent years, the weather has been so unpredictable. The sea level has come up so much that many neighbours of mine are really scared about the possibility of the sea dam breaking,"" he said.

""But even though we're quite scared, we can't go anywhere. Where can we go? We've been living here and earning our living from the sea forever,"" he said.

The report, ""Fighting climate change: Human solidarity in a divided world"", by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) estimates that about 22 million Vietnamese people will lose their houses to rising sea levels.

""If the sea level rises 1m by 2100, 90 per cent of the Mekong delta will be flooded.

""Seventy per cent of its area will be intruded with saline water and two million hectares of rice will disappear,"" said scientist Le Anh Tuan from the Institute for Climate Change Studies at Can Tho University.

""Millions of people will become climate change refugees. Millions of people will fall into poverty,"" the scientist said.

The UNDP report estimates the sea level will rise by 33cm by 2050 and 1m by 2100.

""Agriculture is the sector that is most affected by climate change, specifically by saline water intrusion and sea level rise,"" said Mr Tran Thuc, director of the Viet Nam Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology and Environment.

Fully aware of the serious damage climate change could do to the country's development, the Vietnamese government is building new dams and other structures aimed at mitigating the impact of rising sea levels and contamination of ground water.

New, sturdier varieties of rice, which cope better with cold snaps, have been provided to farmers in northern Nam Dinh province, in the hope that they would withstand more extreme weather conditions in the years ahead.

For people like Mrs Pham Thi Ly, what matters now is simply to have enough clean, fresh water for their families to use and drink.

11,11,FL-2014-000117-BGD,Napa Quake May Cost Up to $4 Billion as Wineries Shuttered - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2014/08/25/338480.htm,"The earthquake that struck northern California yesterday will lead to economic losses of as much as $4 billion, fueled by damaged wineries and shuttered businesses that rely on tourists.

Insurers will probably cover about $2.1 billion, according to an estimate from Kinetic Analysis Corp., which projected total losses of about twice that sum. Costs borne by the industry may be limited because many homeowners don’t have earthquake coverage, according to the Insurance Information Institute.

“The main source of claims could well be commercial claims, those coming from wineries and vineyards and other commercial interests,” Robert Hartwig, the institute’s president, said in an interview today. “It will take a while for the business owners to sort this out.”

The temblor, the strongest in Northern California in 25 years, hit the Napa region north of San Francisco at about 3:20 a.m. local time yesterday, crumpling historic buildings, cracking roads and injuring more than 120 people. The quake left many in the region without power and water, and California Governor Jerry Brown declared the zone a disaster area.

In Napa, debris and broken glass littered the sidewalks in front of restaurants, wine stores, and antique shops. The city updated the number of buildings “red-tagged” as being uninhabitable to 33, including the Napa Senior Center. PG&E Corp. crews checked about 100 reports of gas leaks and odor and determined that there are no more leaks, according to an update posted to the city’s website late yesterday.

Boutique Hotels

Catastrophe-modeler Eqecat estimated there would be $1 billion of insured losses, with as much as half that figure coming from residential claims. The cost for the industry could climb because of coverage that protects commercial policyholders from lost revenue, Eqecat said. Such losses have fueled higher- than-expected claims from other recent catastrophes including superstorm Sandy in 2012.

The Napa region “is dotted with upscale and luxury boutique hotels, spas and inns,” Eqecat said. “Business interruption losses are a major concern.”

The Napa-Sonoma area is home to one of California’s best- known wine-growing regions. Napa County has 789 licensed wineries which had sales of $5.5 billion in 2011, according to the Napa Valley Vintners Association, a trade group.

“It was a significant earthquake” city manager Mike Parness said in an interview. “Given the magnitude and the reports of damage, this is going to take some time to get back from.”

Landmarks Damaged

The facade on the 113-year-old Goodman Library building, home to the city’s historical society and landmarks commission, collapsed during the quake, sending chunks of concrete onto the sidewalk below. The local post office had a 12-foot crack torn into the corner of the building. PG&E said it restored power to about 53,000 of 70,000 customers whose service failed.

Napa also issued a boil-water advisory, which will be rescinded once all the 60 water lines are repaired and water service has been tested and restored.

In California, where most of the costliest U.S. earthquakes occurred, just 12 percent of residents are protected against that risk, which is excluded from a standard homeowners’ policy, according to III, an industry group. The figure is about half that in the Napa area, Hartwig said,

Residential earthquake coverage provides protection from losses tied to shaking and cracking, while costs tied to fires and water damage from a temblor would be covered under a standard policy. The publicly managed, privately funded California Earthquake Authority is the main provider of the policies in California.

The KBW Insurance Index rose 0.8 percent at 10:23 a.m. in New York. Zurich Insurance Group AG, American International Group Inc. and Ace Ltd. are among the companies that sell the most coverage in the region, according to data compiled by Meyer Shields, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

Even after the quake, insured catastrophe losses are running below normal for this time of year, Hartwig said. Through the end of June, U.S. catastrophe costs were about $9.1 billion. Still, claims are often higher in the third quarter, which is the peak of hurricane season.

“It was the most powerful earthquake I’ve ever felt,” said Dianne Cameron, a 45-year-old Napa resident. “It was lifting the bed off the floor so much that I had to hold onto the mattress so I wouldn’t fall off. It was as if someone picked up the house and started shaking it.”

WASHINGTON, August 28, 2014 – More than 170,000 Belizeans will benefit from improved climate resilient roads and capacity to manage climate risks and impacts as a result of a US$30 million project approved by the World Bank’s Board of Directors.

“This project will enable Belize to implement mitigation and adaptation strategies in the war against this global threat as it relates to the negative effects on Belize’s economic growth and welfare of its present and future generations,” said Ambassador Yvonne Hyde, Chief Executive Officer, Ministry of Finance and Economic Development.

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change identified Belize as one of the most vulnerable countries to the adverse impacts of climate change. More than half its population and business centers are at sea level along its low lying coastline. Hurricane Hattie destroyed half of Belize City in 1961, killing 400 people and causing damages amounting to over 600 percent of GDP, which prompted the government to build a new administrative capital 50 miles inland in Belmopan.



“Belize is particularly vulnerable to climate change and natural hazards. This project is an important contribution to address the impacts of climate change on the country’s social and economic development as part of the National Climate Resilient investment plan,” said Sophie Sirtaine, World Bank Country Director for the Caribbean.

“With the upcoming UN Conference on Small Islands Developing States in Samoa next week, this is also an opportunity to draw attention to the efforts needed to boost the resilience of Caribbean states that are particularly hit by rising sea level, flooding, hurricanes, and other disasters,” she added.

The climate resilient infrastructure project will:

Rehabilitate 30 km of roads and train 100 people on road maintenance

Improve 12 bridges and culverts

Operationalize the National Land Use Policy and develop 26 localized hazard maps

Train government staff in new flood tracking methods

This five year project is financed from an International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan of US$30 million to the Government of Belize. It has a final maturity of 40 years, with a five year grace period.","Thu, 28 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/share-logo/social-share.jpg,"['climate', 'economic', 'change', 'project', 'bank', 'resilient', 'impacts', 'world', 'vulnerable', 'belize']",

In that post, he agrees with the political scientist Bjorn Lomborg, who “argues that before poor countries can move to clean energy, poor families need access to cheap electricity so they don’t have to burn dung, cardboard, or twigs for heating and cooking. These dirty fuels produce indoor air pollution that is terrible for health (especially for children).”

In 2012, I wrote in the Huffington Post that Bill Gates had zero qualifications to understand energy and its costs. I also acknowledged that I am not qualified to run a global software company.

So, Bill Gates doesn’t know much about energy outside of his vested interests in nuclear power, and I don’t know much about running a software company outside of my bumbling with my Android apps. I say this about myself even though I have helped with smart metering and oversaw the global implementation for monitoring solar systems worldwide for SunEdison.

But Bill Gates has more money and power than I, as well as a powerful -- and wonderful -- charity. In this instance, however, his charity is misguided. And nothing is more dangerous than misguided charity.

Gates' misguided path starts with the fact that he cited a notorious climate confusionist, Bjorn Lomborg. Lomborg has stubbornly refused to acknowledge the fact that renewable energy is cost-competitive with fossil fuels as an energy source.

Given Gates' stature, framing energy poverty as a climate issue reveals a depth of ignorance that poses a serious problem. So here is reality.

Ending energy poverty has nothing to do with climate change

The International Energy Agency has released a series of reports outlining how the world can end darkness for the 1.3 billion people who currently lack power. Those reports have made clear that the agency's conservative approach (which relies in part on polluting power sources like coal) will only marginally increase carbon emissions. No one argues with this conclusion.

Ending energy poverty requires the right tool for the job: distributed energy

The truth is that an over-reliance on centralized grid extension and large-scale power plants will keep a billion people in the dark. It is time to recognize what even the IEA says is overwhelmingly necessary, but dramatically under-invested in: distributed renewable energy for those living beyond the grid.

To understand why this is so important, take a step back and consider the reaction if Gates wrote a blog suggesting that Mark Zuckerberg is a fool and that the solution for universal internet access around the world is connecting every home around the world via physical fiber-optic cable. The reaction would be riotous laughter. In emerging markets, they are busy ripping out copper and everyone is using wireless. Yet that’s exactly analogous to what Gates is proposing for energy.

No expert on energy access is paying any attention to Gates' folly on energy for the poor

They know that Gates' approach has been tried for 60 years and has failed miserably in almost every emerging market outside of China.

The truth is that knowledgeable entrepreneurs who have invested their lives and limited dollars into this space are making rational business decisions. Those decisions are focused on the cheapest way to deliver energy.

Energy is starting to look a lot like mobile phones, as distributed solutions leapfrog outdated and ineffective centralized networks. They have done so overwhelmingly out of the desire to power the poor -- not to solve climate change. They also happen to rely on the most affordable, effective and direct tool available: distributed clean energy that puts power directly in the hands of poor populations in a timeframe that has an impact.

For proof of the power of distributed energy, look at the growth rates in real-world markets -- not Gates’ blog

The World Bank’s Lighting Africa program clocked a 95 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for solar products being sold beyond the grid in sub-Saharan Africa. In Bangladesh, the wildly successful IDCOL solar program has installed 3 million solar home systems at a whopping 60 percent CAGR over the past decade. After much deliberation, even the dispassionate new prime minister of India decided against grid extension in favor of using distributed energy to meet his 2019 goal of electrifying every family's residence.

In the meantime, grid extension has proceeded at incredibly marginal rates. Worse, 2.5 billion people who are connected to the grid receive power that is so unreliable that they are considered ""under-electrified"" by current grid extension efforts. The cheap reliable grid is a fallacy that is no longer cheap, nor reliable.

When it comes to energy poverty, Gates is arguing for outdated and ineffective solutions that will keep people energy-poor. It is time that we deploy our 21st century energy solutions and put power directly in the hands of the impoverished.

(Photo from Kris Aquino's instagram account)

Filipino bishops are urging people who take on the ""'ce bucket challenge' not to donate money for research using embryonic stem cells.

The Catholic Church views stem cell research as immoral and a violation of the sanctity of human life.

In a statement released on Thursday, Archbishop Socrates Villegas, president of the bishops' conference said there have been reports that research on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) involves the use of stem cells.

The challenge involves dumping a bucket of ice and cold water on someone's head to promote awareness of ALS – commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease -- and to encourage donations for research into its cure.

Villegas said stem cells ""apparently hold out the promise of reversing the death and degeneration of brain cells,"" but warned, ""this type of research is ethically problematic.""

However, ""the importance of ALS research cannot be overstated,"" he said.

Research ""must proceed, for so many suffer,"" but Church leaders ""must also guide the Catholic faithful, and all who heed the ethical teaching of the Church,"" he added.

He said that as long as researches ""keep within the confines of the ethical demands of human dignity"" these will be encouraged by the Church.

He also accused some people of trivializing the ""ice bucket challenge"" by turning it into a fad ""rather than a gesture of solidarity with all who suffer from the disease"".

As of this week, the ALS Association had raised US$88.5 million from the social media campaign.

The association said in a statement on Tuesday that it is ""awestruck"" by the outpouring of generosity.

""This ... isn’t a matter of spending these dollars quickly,"" Barbara Newhouse, president and CEO of the ALS Association, said in a statement.

So warns the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in a draft of its Synthesis report leaked to Bloomberg News. Lurking behind those first seven words is a political choice: To what extent do we react to climate change by trying to stop it, and to what extent do we respond by trying to adapt to it? Which approach will yield more benefits, and which will impose more costs?

The final report, due in November, will combine and summarize the findings in the IPCC's three earlier reports this year. The first of those reports looked at the scientific evidence for man-made global warming. The second analyzed how humanity might respond to warming temperatures through adaptation—the ""process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects."" The third looked at how we might respond through mitigation—""a human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases."" (In addition to cutting the emissions of greenhouse gases, this would include ways to suck such gases out of the atmosphere, by, say, planting more forests.) Most climate researchers believe that some additional warming is inevitable, so people will have to engage in both adaptation and mitigation.

The adaptation report reckons that if the world takes no steps to deal with climate change, and temperatures increase by around 2 degrees Celsius, the annual economic losses will be ""between 0.2 and 2.0% of income."" It adds, ""Losses are more likely than not to be greater, rather than smaller, than this range.""

What about mitigation? Making the heroic set of assumptions that all countries of the world begin mitigation immediately, that everyone adopts the same carbon price, and that all key low- and no-carbon technologies are now available, keeping carbon dioxide concentrations below 450 parts per million by 2100 would reduce consumption growth ""by 0.04 to 0.14 percentage points over the century relative to annualized consumption growth in the baseline that is between 1.6 percent and 3 percent per year."" The median estimate for the reduced annual growth in consumption is 0.06 percent.

How can we compare the projected losses in the adaptation report to the projected costs in the mitigation report?

In 2012, the IPCC asked economists at the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) to peer into the future and devise a plausible set economic development and greenhouse gas emissions scenarios called shared socioeconomic pathways to the year 2100. The economists came up with five different scenarios. Let's take a look at a couple of those scenarios to get some idea of how the world's economy might evolve over the remainder of this century.

The OECD analysis begins in 2010 with a world population of 6.8 billion and a total world gross product of $67 trillion, yielding a global per capita income just shy of $10,000. (All figures are in 2005 dollars.) For reference, the U.S.'s per capita income in 2010 averaged $42,000.

One scenario is described as the ""middle of the road"" projection, in which ""trends typical of recent decades continue, with some progress towards achieving development goals, reductions in resource and energy intensity at historic rates, and slowly decreasing fossil fuel dependency."" If history unfolds as this scenario suggests, world population will peak at around 9.6 billion in 2065 and fall to just over 9 billion by 2100. The world's economy will have grown more than eightfold from $67 trillion to $577 trillion (in 2005 dollars). Average income per person globally will have increased from around $10,000 today to $60,000 by 2100. U.S. annual incomes would average just over $100,000.

In the ""conventional development"" scenario, by contrast, the world economy grows flat out at more than 3 percent annually, relying on ""an energy system dominated by fossil fuels, resulting in high [greenhouse gas] emissions and challenges to mitigation."" Because there is more urbanization and higher levels of education, world population peaks at 8.6 billion in 2055 and falls to 7.4 billion by 2100. The world's economy will grow fifteen-fold to just over $1 quadrillion, and the average person in 2100 will be earning about $138,000 per year. U.S. annual incomes would exceed $187,000 per capita.

It is of more than passing interest that people living in this warmer world are much better off than they would be in the ""middle of the road"" scenario. The OECD analysis notes that these richer and more highly educated people will face ""lower socio-environmental challenges to adaptation,"" thanks to ""attainment of human development goals, robust economic growth, highly engineered infrastructure with redundancy to minimize disruptions from extreme events, and highly managed ecosystems."" In other words, greater wealth and advanced technologies will significantly enhance our capabilities to deal with the consequences of climate change.

Future temperatures will perhaps be higher, by 2100 the average is likely to hover around the ~2°C benchmark. In the scenarios sketched out above, a worst-case 2 percent loss of income resulting from adaptation would mean that the $60,000 and $138,000 per capita income averages would fall to $58,800 and $135,240, respectively.

In the IPCC's mitigation report, the optimal scenario for keeping greenhouse gas concentrations below 450 parts per million would cut future incomes by between 3 and 11 percent by 2100. Let's look at how much the worst-case mitigation scenario might reduce future incomes. Without mitigation, the increase of global gross product to $577 trillion in the ""middle of the road"" scenario implies an economic growth rate of 2.42 percent between 2010 and 2100. Cutting that growth rate by 0.14 percentage points to 2.28 percent yields an income of $510 trillion in 2100, reducing per capita incomes from $60,000 to $57,000. Growth in the conventional development scenario is cut from 3.07 percent to 2.93 percent, reducing overall income from over $1.015 quadrillion to $901 trillion and cutting average incomes from $138,000 to $122,000.

All of these figures must be taken a vat of salt, since they are projections for economic, demographic, and biophysical events nearly a century from now. That being acknowledged, the IPCC's projected losses to incomes from doing nothing to slow climate change appear to be roughly comparable to the losses incurred by trying to slow climate change. In other words, doing nothing about climate change will cost future generations roughly the same as doing something.

""Most philosophers and economists hold that rich generations have a lower ethical claim on resources than poorer generations,"" observes the Yale economist William Nordhaus.

22,22,FL-2014-000117-BGD,PAKISTAN: Statement to mark the International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances - Asian Human Rights Commission News,http://www.humanrights.asia/news/ahrc-news/AHRC-STM-167-2014/,"The government must ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance

The government as well as the judiciary has today fully realized the prevalence of enforced disappearances – being perpetrated by the military and the intelligence services; that these agencies of the government are abducting hundreds, if not thousands of people from different parts of the country make them disappear, in particular from Balochistan where it is done in staggering numbers. The higher judiciary including high courts of the four provinces as well as the Supreme Court on many occasions in cases of disappearances that have been brought before them have found that personnel from the Pakistan army and Para-Military to be involved in such abductions, enforced detentions and later disappearances. The courts have on numerous other occasions ordered the officers to be brought before the court – however, these orders have never been respected by the stubborn government and its ally military apparatus. In one such case before the Supreme Court of Pakistan gave order for the arrest of an Army Brigadier on the charges of having been directly involved in an incident of enforced disappearance of persons – but that order was never adhered with.

Moreover, despite such realization that government has failed to legislate nor implement the already existing legal framework to halt such acts of enforced disappearances and bring those responsible accountable before the law – this failure is a also contrary to Pakistan’s commitments to international obligations and had made firm commitments to ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. In contravention of all such obligations, responsibilities and commitments government officials have been quoted as saying that because of the well-established military regime and the close links with the armed forces, Pakistan’s government is unable to implement such laws on the ground. In its stead, and rather to everyone’s bewilderment, the government has opted to adopt a law which virtually legalized enforced disappearances and extra judicial killings by armed forces and its intelligence services on the pretext of combating terrorism.

The government of Pakistan has accorded unlimited powers to the law enforcement authorities to combat the terrorism through the Pakistan Protection Act of 2014. Last year, in the month of September, the government issued the Pakistan Protection Ordinance (PPO) even without approval at a sitting of the National Assembly. The Ordinance gave nine months for the law enforcement authorities to operate illegally/ in clandestine operations to implement the provisions of the said Act without the knowledge of the Parliament. The Pakistan Protection Act 2014 (PPA) vested unfettered and ruthless powers to law enforcement authorities (LEA) amongst which include the power to shoot a suspect an sight – with the approval of only a grade-15 official and power to detain a suspect for 90 consecutive days without being produced in court. The Act had a retrospective effect which meant that law enforcement authorities, be it the police, military or intelligence services all were provided with wide impunity even for prior actions with regard to incidents of enforced disappearances, torture and extra judicial killings during detention.

It has been observed by the higher judiciary that intelligence agencies including Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and Military Intelligence (MI) were involved in abducting people and having them disappear. The courts have also pointed out the involvement of Frontier Corps (FC) and other Para-Military forces in these abductions and enforced disappearances.

There were also rare incidents of disappearances in Pakistan but after the 9/11 incident (the introduction of war against terrorism) disappearances after arrest have become rampant and today a common practice. Enforced disappearances therefore, took roots in 2001 during the military government of General Musharraf on the pretext of combating the terrorism particularly against the Al-Qaida terrorist group. The government instead of attacking Islamic militant groups such as the Al-Qaida, Taliban etc., – the military government taking advantage waged a war against secular and nationalist forces of Balochistan – a province which has no terrorist links , then became the worst affected province by this government offensive. More than 8,000 persons from political and nationalist parties, students, lawyers, doctors, journalists and human rights defenders are reported missing after their arrest by the military, the Frontier Corps or by other law enforcement agencies. The infamous intelligence agencies like the ISI are being openly blamed of disappearances and killing them extra judicially.

More than 100 nationalists from the Sindh province are also reported missing after their arrest by the intelligence agencies and dozens of disappeared persons have been extra judicially killed.

Religious groups claim that more than 2,000 activists have been made to disappear by the military and government intelligence agencies.

The trend in the increase of enforced disappearances has been a direct cause for the proportional increase in instances of custodial torture and extra judicial killings.

Enforced disappearances in Pakistan have become a routine occurrence; worse, it has been accepted by the authorities as a normal practice of law enforcement agencies, including of the army and its intelligence agencies. Major political parties, a sizeable number of whom are members of the parliament, have been dead silent on the issue of enforced disappearances and torture in military detention cells. The distress caused by the disappearances is that, despite the departure of the government of President Musharraf, the menace continues under the remnant civilian governments. On average, in Balochistan alone, every month at least five or six persons are abducted and made to disappear by plain clothed persons. This is frequently done in the presence of police officers who then refuse to lodge FIRs admitting that intelligence agencies are involved in such disappearances.

Yet a new trend has been reported which is the extrajudicial killing and disposal of the bodies of the victims who have disappeared. Through this method it is easy for the abductors to do away with all evidence of the disappearance, following which there would be no grounds to institute the filing of an FIR, no legal process is needed and no perpetrator can be blamed. During the period of former President Musharraf, the phenomenon of disappearances was commenced through the state agents, and this process has continued in the civilian government at federal and provincial levels of killings by means of extrajudicial methods as a new phase in the story of enforced disappearances in Pakistan – particularly, more so in the province of Balochistan.

Pakistan has amongst the highest number of enforced or involuntary disappearances in the world, with many disappearances continuing to take place, notably in remote areas affected by armed conflict, such as Balochistan Province – in connection with the conflict between governmental armed forces and Balochi Nationalist Armed Forces; Khaiber Pakhtoon Kha province – notably under counter-terrorism, often in connivance with foreign forces; and in Pakistani-held Kashmir – typically for refusal to participate in the “Jihad” inside Indian-held Kashmir or to provide information to the intelligence agencies.

The AHRC has received information concerning hundreds of disappearances in Balochistan since 2002. Hundreds more have also been reported in Khaiber Pakhtun Kha and Pakistan-held Kashmir, with tens of cases being reported in Sindh and Punjab provinces.

Pakistan has appointed several commissions on enforced disappearances but not a single commission was allowed to report on the facts because of the strong resistance from the armed forces and its intelligence agencies. A judicial commission was also formed headed by a judge of the Supreme Court, who later retired. The commission had the mandate of completing its findings in one year but, in fact, two years have passed and the commission has still not finalized its proceedings. The Supreme Court has been tackling this issue since 2005 but the court has still not come out with the facts about the missing persons. There is always a big fiasco and a show of good faith made in the court rooms, on the date of the hearings in order to appease the media but all this has never led to stopping the menace of enforced disappearances – despite incontrovertible evidence. Nor has any person from the armed forces and its intelligence agencies, been brought to justice and been made accountable for the enforced disappearances.

In many cases victims who were released from captivity of the armed forces testified before the higher courts that they were held in military torture cells however, the courts have repeatedly refused to pass any judgment and refused to call for a proper inquiry on the evidence provided by the persons themselves who have been held in undisclosed places, tortured and abused for periods of several months in the least.

The Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) has documented hundreds of cases of extra-judicial killings in Pakistan, all of which have been accompanied by impunity, due to a lack of investigations and prosecutions. Many such killings are linked to enforced disappearances and torture, following which victims only surface after they are dead – most often even the body, does not surface. For example, in Balochistan Province, between July 2010 and January 2014, the AHRC documented more than 700 extra-judicial killings and following abductions by paramilitary forces or following enforced disappearances by Pakistan’s law enforcement and security agencies. Journalists, teachers, political activists, students and human rights defenders have been targeted in particular.

The AHRC urges the government, even at this late stage, to affirm its commitment to end enforced disappearances once and for all, by ratifying the International Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance and to enact laws against the enforced disappearances. The government must show its political will to respect the freedom and liberty of the individual and must eliminate the practices of keeping persons in incommunicado, practices of torture and extra judicial killings.

If there is concrete evidence made available of any person’s involvement in such gruesome acts of terrorism and extra constitutional/judicial activities such persons should be and must be brought before the law and the judiciary should be the sole adjudicator who should be accorded with the power to try the accused persons and pass judgment and to see that such judgment is implemented.

The AHRC urges both the parliament and the judiciary of Pakistan to take charge of the defense forces and make them answerable to the people of Pakistan. In doing so the government must repeal with immediate effect, the Pakistan Protection Act 2014 – which gives draconian power to its military forces and other law enforcement agencies. There must be established a system of rule of law – which is non-existent in Pakistan – and the military should be brought only under such a framework based on the rule of law.","Fri, 29 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.humanrights.asia/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AHRC-STM-167-2014-01.jpg,"['international', 'enforced', 'victims', 'persons', 'intelligence', 'military', 'law', 'disappearances', 'agencies', 'forces', 'statement', 'enforcement', 'day', 'pakistan', 'mark']", 
23,23,FL-2014-000117-BGD,Sintratec to Crowd Fund The World’s Most Affordable SLS 3D Printer For Around $5000 - 3DPrint.com,https://3dprint.com/12944/sintratec-sls-3d-printer-cheap/,"After an explosion in the number of fused deposition modeling 3D printers to hit the market in the last two years, it seems like stereolithgraphy technology is beginning to hit its stride as well, with companies like Autodesk entering the space later this year. All the while, one technology which as been reserved only for expensive professional grade printers, selective laser sintering(SLS), has remained unheard of from a consumer or lower-end printer standpoint.

This all changed when a company called Norge Systems, earlier this month, announced that they will soon offer two SLS 3D printers on Kickstarter, called the Ice1 and Ice9, starting at just $13,000. You may be thinking that $13,000 certainly is not cheap, but compared to the typical six to seven digits you’d normally pay, this would in fact be a revolutionary product for the space. Norge Systems doesn’t seem to be the only one working on such a machine. It appears that the flood gates may be just about to open for more affordable SLS printers. A new Swiss technology startup called Sintratec is also working on an SLS machine, which will be even cheaper than the printers that Norge Systems is launching next year.

Founded by Joscha Zeltner, Christian von Burg and Dominik Solenicki, who have been working on the technology behind their printer for almost two years now, Sintratec plans to launch an Indiegogo campaign for their machine in October. Below are some of the specifications the company has released to 3DPrint.com. Further details are forthcoming as we get closer to the launch date of the company’s crowdfunding campaign.

Build Volume: 130x130x130 mm³ Printable

Printer Size: 500x500x300 mm³

Layer-Height: Depends on the sintering powder used. Most powders have a grain size of 40 to 80 microns. This determines the limiting minimum factor for the layer height. The upper limit is about 150 microns.

Print Speed: For fully sintered results they determined the laser spot speed to be about 70 mm/s.

The printer works by layering powdered material, preferably nylon, in a print bed. A laser then sinters(melts) one layer of nylon, before an additional layer is placed on top. Because of this method, no support material is needed, as the powder surrounding the object as it is printed in the bed, acts as a support. When some people hear ‘laser sintering’ they immediately jump to the conclusion that metals are being melted. The Sintratec will not print in metal, as Dominik Solenicki , from Sintratec explains:

“Metal printing would be awesome indeed. But sadly it’s highly dangerous, it requires an inert atmosphere and tons of security features that would drive the price up insanely.” Quote request Are you looking to buy a 3D printer or 3D scanner?

Sintratec is hoping that they can offer these printers in kit form to backers for a rather affordable price of 3999€ ($5,277) or under. They have noted that in order to be able to offer these prices, by taking advantage of economies of scale, they will need to pre-sell at least 60 of these machines on Indiegogo, or have a crowd funding goal set at approximately 240,000€.

It will certainly be interesting to see where we are in another year or two. Will SLS 3D printers be commonplace, and how far will prices drop? Let’s hear your thoughts on this new printer which will soon come to market, in the Sintratec forum thread on 3DPB.com.

24,24,FL-2014-000117-BGD,How Mumbai created civic history - Daily News & Analysis,https://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/standpoint-how-mumbai-created-civic-history-2013509,"August 11, 2014 marked a historic day for urban planning and governance in India with Mumbai leading the way. For the first time since Independence, a municipal corporation, namely the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai​ (MCGM), initiated public consultations at the ward level during the process of preparing the city’s development plan.

A Development Plan (DP), simply put, is a spatial map on which land is earmarked for specific purposes in accordance with a particular imagined future. In Mumbai, the process and formulation of the DP every 20 years is mandated under the Maharashtra Regional & Town Planning Act. What the MCGM has done is pioneering because it expands the planning process by opening up the new DP (valid from 2014-34) to public participation in the preparation stage itself rather than after the final draft has been prepared, as specified in the Act. This is to be commended because it starts from the premise of what is good planning rather than restricting itself to what is specified by our outdated Town Planning Acts.

Since there were no clear precedents for how to conceive of such a public participation process, it was a process of ‘learning by doing’ with the MCGM and a number of civil society groups playing a key role in responding to and pressuring the other. The MCGM started with opening up the existing land use maps to the public for verification in 2012. Thereafter the Standing Committee Chairperson took the initiative to call a public meeting to discuss the maps. Over the next few months various groups started organizing under the banner Hamara Shehar Vikas Niyojan Abhiyan Mumbai. This city-wide campaign aimed to bring together research institutions, NGOs, CBOs and citizen-activists with the agenda of sustaining the process of participation in urban planning. In October 2013 the campaign released the People's Vision for Mumbai at Azad Maidan; with the help of the Standing Committee Chairperson a contingent from the campaign met the Municipal Commissioner to demand for inclusion of this vision in the DP. In November, the Municipal Commissioner called for a meeting with a select set of invitees to initiate dialogue on the Preparatory Studies. At its conclusion, invitees, including campaign members, called for more open and deeper public participation. The MCGM agreed to organize a series of 14 thematic consultations in partnership with various city organizations through December 2013 and January 2014.

Thematic discussions enabled deeper understanding on important themes such as housing. The campaign played a significant role in building understanding on themes that were not traditionally approached within the planning discourse, such as issues of informal sector workers and indigenous people’s settlements. Thematic meetings also strived to be more accessible by holding presentations in Marathi/Hindi, unlike the presentation in English at the November meeting. In a bid toward transparency, all meetings were recorded by the MCGM.

But in a city as diverse and unequal as Mumbai public participation is best achieved at the local level. The recently concluded public consultations at the ward level (Aug 11- 21) were an outcome of follow-up and homework done by MCGM and campaign groups, and represent a step further in institutionalizing mechanisms for public participation in urban planning. The ward level consultations had a common format – two videos were screened, one on existing land use and various growth scenarios in the city and one on existing status of the ward thus giving city-level context and ward-level detail. Suggestions were then invited from the public either through speaking out or by noting down which areas require specific services in an amenity assessment form.

Despite having a common format, in practice ward consultations have played out very differently. Some have resulted in a flood of useful suggestions with many people being given a chance to speak while in others submitting the assessment form was emphasized. This variation is largely due to the different initiative and commitment to genuine participation shown by key officials - the Assistant Commissioner of the ward and the DP Officials present. Striking differences in issues raised have been observed, with class being a clear marker. While poorer wards focus on basic needs including schools and health facilities, richer wards are distinguished by the amount of time spent discussing parking and roads. Notably, open space provision is a concern that cuts across all wards. As for who is participating in these ward-level consultations, while this depends on the profile of the ward it seems to predominantly be older men. This reflects our male-dominated society. Working people also find it hard to participate in consultations that are held in the middle of the day (11-2pm).

Reviewing the past two years, the space created for participation seems to have enabled a space for expanding organizing around civic issues and for social learning that cuts across class, neighborhood, public and private. This is important in our increasingly fragmented and polarized city. Two factors have been critical for this. First, the process had credibility because MCGM was willing to engage in public participation and be responsive to concerns raised and this made participation worthwhile for people. This political innovation is particularly noteworthy given that public institutions are characterized by opaque and non-participatory cultures. Second, participants especially poorer ones received support from the campaign that helped in coordination and understanding complex and contested issues.

Clearly people participated in the DP process seeing it as means to the goal of access to land, services and amenities they consider vital; therefore, focusing on the process of participation in planning is definitely important. However, it is in incorporation of the suggestions being put forth that the real test of participation lies. For this to be successful, the collaboration between MCGM and city groups needs to expand to cover other public agencies and committees that are involved in planning for the city.

The MCGM is receiving written suggestions on the DP till September 15th. Suggestions can be emailed to dprevision.mcgm@gmail.com

Property prices in Sihanoukville are on the rise with premium main road and beach front properties selling for about 10 per cent more than this time last year, says Po Eavkong, managing director of Asia Real Estate Cambodia. Eavkong said properties along backstreets had gone up 5 to 7 per cent.

Land along the seafront was priced between $700 to $800 per square metre, around the commercial area from $800 to $1,000 per square metre and sub-road land prices were valued between $150 to $300 per square metre, he said.

“Land prices in Metta Pheap commune saw a big increase, but land outside of the city and along the National Road Number 4 remained stable, comparing to the same period last year,” he said.

Sung Bonna, director of Bonna Realty Group, said the Sihanoukville real estate market was still developing slowly as it was seen as a tourist area.

“It’s increasing slowly because the area is popular for tourists only in peak season and they only stay a short time,” he said. “The number of people in the area is not attractive for investors yet.”

Cheng Kheng, the director of real estate firm CPL and president of the Cambodian Valuers and Estate Agents Association, said land transactions in Sihanoukville were increasing notably.

Young Welsh Muslims campaigning for peace say Cardiff jihadis fighting for IS in Syria are not following the true teachings of Islam – and have called on all faith communities to work to stop extremism.

The members of the youth wing of the Welsh Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, a Muslim sect with 500 members in Wales, said people of all faiths and none must do more to encourage young people to take part in British life.

They want more to be done to give young Welsh Muslims a sense of belonging to stop them becoming radicalised like Nasser Muthana. The 20-year-old fighting alongside his brother Aseel, 17, and friend Reyaad Khan, 20, for the Sunni militant group behind the beheading of American journalist James Foley, they said.

Speaking days after Nasser boasted on Twitter about the deaths of 250 Shia soldiers, the youngsters said people of all faiths and none must do more to encourage young people to take part in British life.

Engaging young Muslims in charity work, sponsored sport events and even encouraging them to donate blood could all help them feel part of British and Welsh society rather than wanting to fight against it are among their ideas.

In pictures: Cardiff's links to Islamic extremism:

Rohail Sadat, 16, who has just finished GCSEs at Whitchurch High in Cardiff and Sabah Shakoor, 28, an aeronautical engineering student from Cardiff, said extremists are spreading the wrong message about Islam making it even harder to tackle the problem.

“We denounce all extremism. If my friends ask me about extremism I explain it’s the wrong interpretation of Islam, but it is hard to explain sometimes,” said Rohail.

“I don’t agreed with extremism at all. Maybe if these people were educated more they would not be inclined to go (to Syria and Iraq).

“We need more community activities to bring us together.”

Sabah, a former Cathays High pupil, who is charitable coordinator of the Welsh Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, has organised events including sales of poppies for Remembrance Day, helping the Somerset flood relief effort and blood donation, all of which helped young members taking part have a stake in the community they live in, he said.

“I totally disagree with going to fight in Syria,” said Sabah, whose group is entering members into the Cardiff Half Marathon for charity and organises peace conferences.

“Islam means peace and the AMC’s motto is “love for all, hatred for no one”.

“The AMC is trying to get across the message of peace and love for all. Jihad is for self reformation, not political gain.”

He said violent jihad was “not the teaching of Islam” but agreed it was hard to get that message across to some young people fired up by unrest across the Middle East.

Welsh peer calls on young, professional Muslims to take an active role fighting extremism

Haris Malik, 39, an IT engineer from Cardiff who is the AMC’s youth coordinator for Cardiff, said the 50 young members in Cardiff are trying to spread the word of peace at a difficult time.

Violent chaos spreading through Iraq and Syria is fuelled by religious sectarianism between Sunni and Shia Muslims while Israel and Hamas have agreed to an open-ended ceasefire in the Gaza war after seven weeks of fighting that has seen more than 2,200 people killed, the vast majority of them Palestinians.

“We need stronger bonds to stop extremism here,” said Haris, “The flags raised at our gatherings are our flag and the British flag. We are British and living here. We want to serve this society and country first.

“If we can share a peaceful message with the youth they will not be inclined to go away to war.”

The three will be among 400 Muslims from Wales joining tens of thousands from across the world gathering in Hampshire for a three day event this weekend to pledge allegiance to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community their caliphate and its leader His Holiness Mirza Masroor Ahmad.

Members of the minority Muslim sect, most of whose families come originally from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, worship in community halls across Wales, but must travel to London for their nearest mosque.

Naveed Mughal, spokesman for the community in Cardiff and coordinator for the youth wing in Wales, said atrocities committed in the name of Islam in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, have nothing to do with true religion.

He said: “I would say to Welsh jihadis, or people supporting them, they need to understand the true Islamic teachings. Islam does not permit violence against other Muslims or any other fellow human beings.

“Violence is not the answer whether you are Muslim, Jewish, Christian, any other faith, or no faith.

“To help stop young people tempted to become jihadis stakeholders need to give them more sense of belonging to British culture.

AMC members will travel today from Rhyl. Cardiff, Swansea and Newport to the convention in Hampshire, known as the Jalsa Salana.

It is the largest and longest standing Muslim convention in the UK with members expected from 89 countries including the Middle East, Australia and USA and proceedings transmitted to 80 million Muslims worldwide in 12 languages.","Wed, 27 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article7678993.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/JS44905079JPG.jpg,"['campaigners', 'islam', 'muslim', 'muslims', 'members', 'stop', 'british', 'syria', 'young', 'cardiff', 'extremism', 'welsh', 'outline', 'plans', 'community', 'peace']",

Most rice exporters are reluctant and hesitate in accepting the challenge of launching brands that would invariably fetch better returns.





As a result, Pakistan has been unable to retain its highest-ever export volume of basmati rice achieved in fiscal year (FY) 2010-11.The country’s rice exports increased during the last few years in terms of value not due to higher volumes but because exporters have been able to get a better price for basmati rice. In FY14, exporters got a record average price of basmati rice in the international market.Pakistan exported $1.85 billion worth of rice in FY14 in which basmati’s share was just $846 million.However, the situation in the non-basmati rice category is even worse as its brands are almost non-existent.Is it that difficult to launch a brand or is it just incompetence and complacency?Successful exporters, who have been able to brand well, have mixed views.“I used to export basmati rice in bulk,” said Jawed Ali Ghori, managing director at Matco — arguably the country’s biggest basmati exporter. “Over time, I realised that I wasn’t getting the right price and was also playing in the hands of importers who used to misuse their position.”Ghori is the second generation in the rice business, which was set up by his father 50 years ago in 1964. Today, Matco exports rice to over 65 countries while its flagship brand Falak is sold in over 35 countries.“Since, I was exporting rice in bulk without branding, I was like any other rice exporter to importers. They used to cancel large deals over a small price difference, which would be as small as $10 per ton. That attitude of importers compelled me to make my product stand out.“After decades of bulk rice exports, I launched my own brand a decade ago and after a few years of struggle, I am getting the price I want.”Industry officials say that Pakistan exports most of its rice with no proper processing or packaging, losing out on millions of dollars every year.“Rice exports in bulk quantity definitely dents the export earnings of Pakistan,” said Engro EXIMP Chief Executive Abdul Samad Khan said.Engro EXIMP is the subsidiary of Engro Corporation – one of the largest conglomerates in Pakistan – that started its rice business in 2010. Its basmati brand ‘Rymah’ is now available in many countries. The company’s rice sales, including exports, touched 58,500 tons in 2013, up 50% compared to 39,000 tons in 2012.“Pakistan’s basmati rice exports have declined due to the success of Indian brands in the international market, but we can fight to regain the market share if we introduce good quality brands and invest in them,” he added.Khan informed that the leading branded basmati rice exporters are getting around $500 per ton higher than the non-branded basmati rice exporters. After taking out all the other expenses including packaging, leading Indian basmati rice exporters are easily pocketing $300 per ton due to branding. In FY14, Pakistan exported 733,860 tons of basmati rice worth $846 million out of which only around 70,000 tons were branded — not even 10% of the total basmati exports.Industry officials say lack of professionalism is one of the reasons behind the low exports. Rice is still part of the small and medium size industries with only a couple of players.Indian companies crossed that bridge many years ago and have professional managers handling their business who know how to build and manage brands, said Khan.“Brand building requires investment and patience. The rice sector in Pakistan has generally not been willing to make that investment,” he stressed, adding that the industry also does not possess the scale to be able to afford the kind of investment required.According to Khan, a good brand-building effort can take a minimum of around two to three years in the international market. It requires introduction in at least six to seven markets in the Middle East and investment during the brand-building period.The concepts in launching a domestic or international rice brand are almost the same, but the execution for each market is different, he said, adding that the company has to invest in market research separately to gauge consumer product and price preferences, find the right distributors, and ensure placement.the writer is a staff correspodent","Sun, 24 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://tribune-reloaded.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/753053-RiceJalalabadafganistancopy-1408894703/753053-RiceJalalabadafganistancopy-1408894703.JPG,"['exporters', 'brand', 'tons', 'india', 'hurts', 'basmati', 'branding', 'exports', 'price', 'lack', 'market', 'brands', 'rice', 'ahead', 'industry', 'pakistan', 'moves']", 
30,30,FL-2014-000117-BGD,Who is Imam Al-Bukhari? - ummid.com,https://www.ummid.com/news/2014/August/29.08.2014/imam-bukhari.html,"Who is Imam Al-Bukhari?

THE sources of knowledge that Muslims rely upon for almost every aspect of their lives are the Holy Qur’an revealed by Allah and Hadith; the traditions and sayings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) narrated and transmitted by men and women surrounding the Prophet (peace be upon him) during his lifetime. In order to preserve this knowledge, the sayings of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his way of life were recorded and compiled in books.

Among the most notable and trusted books of Hadith is the book of Imam Al-Bukhari but many of us do not know much about who he is. In fact, his book, Sahih Al-Bukhari is considered the most authentic and reliable book after the Holy Qur’an. His book contains 7,275 authentic and accurate sayings of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and he did not include any saying unless it is authentic.

Authentic in the science of Hadith means that it is conveyed by a trustworthy, competent person, both in the ability to memorize and to preserve what he wrote and it must have a connected chain of narration back to the person who saw or heard the Prophet (peace be upon him). For a Hadith to be deemed authentic, each person in the chain of narration should have no flaws in memory or in character.

In what was then known as Bukhara, or Uzbekistan today, Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Ismail ibn Ibrahim ibn Mughira Al-Ja’afi Al-Bukhari was born on the 13th of Shawwal, the year 194 after Hijra. He was born into an ascetic family to a wealthy yet humble, pious, and generous father.

When Al-Bukhari was still a boy, his father died, and his mother spared no effort in looking after his health and providing him with the best education.

From a very young age, Al-Bukhari showed an interest and mental keenness for learning Hadith. He had an exceptional memory and devotion to learning. In his teen years, he had memorized 70,000 Hadith and later in his life, he memorized around 300,000 Hadith. Not only did he memorize the Hadith, but he studied the history of each person who narrated the Hadith. He had a remarkable memory and sharp intellect and he could memorize a book simply by briefly glancing at it.

Al-Bukhari sensed a need for compiling a book, which would encompass all of the authentic Hadith because up until his time, there was no such complete book. Some books on hadith contained a mix of authentic and weak Hadith, and most books contained some but not all of the authentic Hadith.

He also had a personal reason for documenting such a book of the sayings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Imam Al-Bukhari had a vision; he dreamt that he was fanning away flies from Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), which symbolizes his mission to dispel lies and false information about the Prophet (peace be upon him).

At age 22 he started the mammoth task of collecting authentic Hadith and he only recorded in his book those sayings which he found to be genuine after thorough scrutiny. He spent 16 years in research and examined over 60,000 sayings, from which he selected 7,275 sayings that are authentic and accurate.

He traveled great distances to seek knowledge of Hadith from scholars and narrators. He visited Damascus, Cairo, Baghdad, Basra, Iran, Makkah, and Madinah.

He inherited vast wealth from his father but he preferred a simple life and gave generously in charity to those in need and to his students. His passion for knowledge and for teaching left in him no care or concern for worldly pleasures. He ate very little and was thin. Because he had no time for eating lavish meals, he often went through a whole day only on a handful of almonds or dried leaves.

Not only was he a scholar but he was a sensitive person and vigilant worshiper. He split his nights into three portions: one-third for prayer, one-third for knowledge and his research in Hadith, and one-third for sleep. He despised backbiting or speaking ill of others. He was courteous, tolerant, and gentle. He never became angry if mistreated by other persons and if he needed to correct anyone, he would not embarrass that person in public.

An almost super-natural memory was a gift from God but he put his gift to good use. He dedicated his life to write a book that includes everything about our Prophet (peace be upon him) from his physical characteristics to his manner of speech to how he dressed, how he treated his wives in the privacy of his home, how he was with his companions, how he carried out business transactions, and how he performed acts of worship.

Hearing a saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him) recorded in Sahih Al-Bukhari should render in us a bit more awe and appreciation for who Al-Bukhari was. (Saudi Gazette)
