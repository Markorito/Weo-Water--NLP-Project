Every year the “Plum Rains” of May, June and July bring flooding and landslides to southern China.

The flooding regularly comes from swelling rivers but, often, locally intense thunderstorms cause flash floods and landslides.

There has been a recent resurgence of these monsoon rains in the southern provinces of Guizhou, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Guangdong and Fujian.

China’s Xinhua News Agency reported that the rains in southern Guangdong province have displaced more than 8,000 people.

Floods in Guizhou province left 29,000 people isolated following massive thunderstorms in the area. As much as 134 millimetres of rain fell in a short period on Friday, sending flood waters tearing through the villages of Jiuchao and Maogong, sweeping three people away.

Most recently, Liuzhou city in in Guangxi province has seen the Liujiang River burst its banks with dramatic force. At least 150mm of rain was recorded in a 24-hour period but 130mm of that fell in less than three hours, causing a surge of water that swept away or overturned vehicles.

According to Chinese state media, persistent rains since Saturday have caused material losses of $7.8m.

The Plum Rains, from the Meiyu monsoon front, will soon move north and swell the Yangtse River. Progress of this annual event is not smooth. There are always pulses of heavy rain, so the risk of further floods remains throughout southern China.","Tue, 14 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/4016ec25294b4ffd92123eb7e9caedb3_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['province', 'plum', 'provinces', 'china', 'thunderstorms', 'monsoon', 'river', 'period', 'flooding', 'rains', 'rain', 'southern', 'bring']",

But a new decade-long report, involving the work of 3,000 scientists, reveals that China’s environmental policies are making clear positive impacts.

“China has gone further than any other country, as strange as that sounds given all the devastation that we read about on the environment front there,” said Gretchen Daily, the Bing Professor of Environmental Science at Stanford and senior author on the study. “In the face of deepening environmental crisis, China has become very ambitious and innovative in its new conservation science and policies and has implemented them on a breathtaking scale.”

The efforts are guided in part by software developed by the research team, which identifies which environmental areas should be protected or restored to provide the greatest benefit. Through this work, China has eagerly incorporated science and funded some of the most far-reaching efforts in the world, which could serve as a model for other countries, according to the study’s authors.

Daily and an international team of researchers report the results of the China ecosystem assessment, which was launched by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection, in the June 17 issue of Science.

Policy born from environmental crisis

Officials in China began considering significant environmental reform following a series of natural disasters in the late 1990s that were exacerbated by human activities. In particular, in 1998, massive deforestation and erosion contributed to devastating flooding along the Yangtze River. Thousands of people were killed, and more than 13 million people were left homeless following $36 billion in property damage.

That this occurred just a year after a historic drought signaled to officials in the country that steps needed to be taken to protect and restore China’s natural capital. By 2000, China developed the Natural Forest Conservation Program and the Sloping Land Conversion Program, $50 billion projects aimed at reducing natural disaster risks by restoring forest and grassland, while also improving life conditions for 120 million poverty-stricken farmers.

Such investments can have big payoffs, said Steve Polasky, Fesler-Lampert Professor of Ecological/Environmental Economics at the University of Minnesota and a co-author of the study. “Restoring forests and grasslands can reduce flooding and sandstorms, which has large benefits for the people downstream and downwind,” he said.

The new report used InVEST, a software suite designed by The Natural Capital Project for evaluating economic and environmental tradeoffs, to assess these efforts from 2000-2010 by analyzing data from satellites, soil samples, biodiversity surveys, meteorology, hydrological studies and other types of field surveys.

The researchers found that the conservation policies improved key ecosystem services such as soil retention, water supply, carbon sequestration and sand storm prevention on a country-wide scale.

“The hope is that this can bring about a transformation in the way people think of and account for the values of nature,” said Daily, who is a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment and co-director of the Natural Capital Project.

A worldwide approach for environmental accounting

Much of China’s success in these areas can be traced to how officials incorporate assessments of the state of ecosystems and their economic values to society into decision-making processes. This approach, Daily said, is applicable anywhere on planet Earth.

For instance, forests, wetlands and other heavily vegetated places play a key role in regulating the flow of water and its quality, but these are under constant threat of conversion to farming or settlement.

“China is using science to identify and define the priority areas for protection or restoration in order to improve water security in a way that anybody could apply,” she said.

Likewise, sand storms are a significant problem in eastern cities and are the result of deforestation and dry conditions. The researchers identify the areas that should be restored to mitigate storms, and which forested areas are at future risk of contributing to sand storms, and should thus be protected.

The science can inform society’s choices, Daily said, but it can’t make the final call. Research can quantify the benefits a particular area can provide if it were used to grow food or reforested to prevent floods, but ultimately it will be up to policymakers to decide, both for that region and where the decision falls within a set of national priorities.

There are still areas where China needs improvement. Although the country has the highest rate of reforestation in the world, many of the newly planted trees are not native to the regions. These plantings are a pragmatic short-term answer to rebuilding forests efficiently, quickly and inexpensively, Daily said, but don’t fare as well in the long term. This provides a basic infrastructure for wildlife, but biodiversity continues to worsen, and will do so until there is a more natural landscape.

The assessment didn’t examine other significant challenges, such as air quality and increasing greenhouse gas emissions. These will require interventions beyond ecosystem restoration alone.

“To realize the dream of becoming the ecological civilization of the 21st century, China needs more innovation in approaches to securing both nature and human well-being,” Daily said. “This is humanity’s grand challenge – and while China is only in the first phases of transformation, its efforts are inspiring adaptation and adoption of their approaches in other countries worldwide.”

The study, titled “Improvements in ecosystem services from investments in natural capital,” is published in the June 17 issue of Science.

Four days of heavy and steady rain has left at least 10 people dead in the south of Ghana. The streets of Accra have been left under water after the torrential downpours caused widespread flooding earlier this week.

The nation’s capital was hit bit 185mm of rain on Sunday, which is more than they would expect for the entire month of June. This is the wettest month of the year with an average rainfall of 178mm.

Since the weekend a further 50mm of rain has fallen exacerbating the severe problems already faced. President John Dramani Mahama has surveyed the areas concerned. He was reported to have driven through several neighbourhoods on a motorcycle.

Heavy downpours were also recorded 150km to the west of Accra in the Central Regional capital, Cape Coast where 10 people died in floods, Sandy Amartey, regional coordinator of the National Disaster Management organisation, told AFP.

“In all we have 10 to 12 who lost their lives during this rainy season.”

The rains come too late to save the nations struggling coca crop. The region’s Harmattan winds have been blamed for likely poor yield.

The Harmattan is the cold, dry wind that blows across West Africa from the Sahara during the winter months. It does have a tendency to sap the moisture from the soil and can spoil the cocoa seeds.

The rains finally arrived in March. Since then they have been insufficiently light and patchy until recently.

This current spell of heavy showers is set to continue well into next week.

The rainy season is not expected to ease significantly until early July.","Thu, 16 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/e3d9862639724dcfaf919bb397bf897f_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['weekthe', 'rainy', 'floods', 'west', 'downpours', 'widespread', 'rain', 'rains', 'nations', 'dead', 'leave', 'ghana', 'regional', 'southern', 'season']",

6,6,FL-2016-000064-CHN,Disasters Debated - Scientific American,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/disasters-debated/,"A cyclonic circulation swirled over Boulder, Colo., in September 2013 and drew a river of moisture from the Pacific Ocean off Mexico’s coast. It dumped rain on the people below for five days.

In that month alone, Boulder received more than half the precipitation it gets in an entire year. Saturated soils refused the water. It fell down mountainsides and roared through towns. Searching for an appropriate superlative, the National Weather Service called the storm ""biblical.""

The Colorado floods followed Superstorm Sandy, which had drowned the Northeast coast the previous year and cost the nation $75 billion in damage. Was this the new normal, people asked—and what was the risk of such storms returning?

That question underpins attribution science, a relatively new field of research practiced by a small group of scientists. Their findings are meant to help people in positions of power—politicians, humanitarian workers, water managers, hospital administrators—make decisions about adapting to a changing world.

There were 10 extreme weather events in 2015 that cost more than $1 billion each in the United States. They killed 155 people. The death toll is grimmer globally. Roughly 850,000 people died worldwide between 1980 and 2014 in tropical storms, floods, heat waves, droughts and other catastrophes, according to Munich Re Group. Most deaths have been in Asia. Most monetary losses have been in North America.

The toll gives the scientists’ communiqués political power. President Obama has used freak weather to help convince people that climate change is here, now, to the consternation of Republicans. Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee and a self-proclaimed climate skeptic, criticized the attempt in February.

""Statements by President Obama and others that attempt to link extreme weather events to climate change are unfounded,"" Smith said.

So, who is correct? It depends. On the one hand, we live in a changing world, and all extreme events are caused by both climate change and nature. On the other, scientists cannot find a human fingerprint in many extreme weather events with great confidence using the techniques they have at hand. At most, they can tie heat waves and cold spells to climate change. They understand less about droughts and heavy rainfall, and very little about hurricanes, tropical storms, wildfires, extreme snow and hailstorms, according to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.

That has led at least one outspoken scientist to question whether traditional attribution downplays the impact people have on the climate. Now the scientific community is faced with a new question: asking not whether humans affect extreme weather events, but assuming they do and instead questioning the extent of their impact.

Is Earth smoking a cigarette?

Attribution science was born out of a flood. In 2003, Myles Allen, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford, watched the River Thames rise to within 30 centimeters (nearly 12 inches) of his kitchen door, he wrote in a commentary in Nature. On the radio, a meteorologist told listeners that scientists could not say definitively that the flood was caused by climate change, but similar events might occur more often.

That wasn’t good enough for Allen. People who stand to lose their homes want clearer answers, he wrote.

Since then, Allen and his colleagues have been at the forefront of efforts to say whether particular extreme weather events have become more likely due to climate change.

It’s a difficult task because all storms are caused by a unique set of atmospheric and oceanic drivers, and the probability of those drivers repeating in the same way is zero. As Heraclitus of Ephesus said, ""you cannot step into the same river twice, for other waters are continually flowing in.""

Allen proposed a workaround. Rather than assign blame to humans for particular extremes, scientists could study a class of events, such as heavy rainfall in a certain geography, and say whether past human actions have increased their risk.

""It is similar to looking at, how did cigarette smoking increase the likelihood of death or the risk of cancer?"" said Heidi Cullen, a scientist with the nonprofit Climate Central.

The following year, in 2004, Allen and Peter Stott, head of the U.K. Met Office, released the first climate change attribution study. The previous summer had set heat records in Europe. More than 80,000 people had died across 12 nations. On Aug. 10, 2003, meteorologists in the United Kingdom watching their CRT computer screens saw the temperatures crawl past the previous record of 100 degrees Fahrenheit. It was set in 1990.

Allen and Stott found that human actions had doubled the risk of such heat waves. Human actions, they said, had created 75 percent of the increased risk.

""After that 2004 European heat wave paper, the floodgates really opened, and more scientists were interested in looking at individual events,"" Cullen said.

Allen and Stott had analyzed the simplest part of global warming—a heat wave. The findings might have been a breakthrough, but they were hardly surprising. In fact, it would be unusual if all the carbon that humans are pumping out didn’t cause more heat waves, said Ted Shepherd, a climate scientist at the University of Reading in England.

""It would be almost incredible, it’d take something very unusual not to have an increase in warm extremes,"" he said.

We need 2 worlds

For other types of extremes, attribution gets complicated quickly. To understand why, consider how these studies are done.

In the 1990s, University of California, Berkeley, scientists began listening for messages from extraterrestrials in radio signals captured from space. As expected, searching for E.T. was computing-heavy. Instead of building a supercomputer, the scientists built a virtual network called ""stay@home"" that uses the idle computing power of internet-connected desktops around the world. The only thing needed to run it is people with a modicum of nerdiness who compete with each other to analyze the most signals and track their contributions on leaderboards.

""We just asked the people who were doing stay@home, are you also interested with researching extreme weather and climate events?"" said Friederike Otto, an Oxford physicist who helms the weather attribution initiative with Allen.

The experiments run on 70,000 computers. Their setup resembles clinical trials, such as one where doctors test a drug by comparing lab rats that get the drug with those that don’t. For the planet, the drug is carbon dioxide. Scientists want to know if it changes the occurrence of extreme weather events. They would of course need two sets of planets—one that’s exposed to humans and one that’s not—to conduct a real study.

Instead, they turn to computers. Climate models are virtual representations of Earth split into grids. Each cell contains algorithms that reflect the interactions among the ocean, clouds, water vapor, aerosols, trees, soil and other tiny widgets. Scientists can input observations taken from the real world into the model, which crunches forward in time and spits out a climate forecast for decades hence.

As one might surmise, representing how a tree interacts with a cloud (and they do interact) in algorithms is challenging. There are about 30 climate models available today, and each has slightly different physics, which means their forecasts do not always match. Scientists do not rely on any one model and instead consider results from a bunch of models, which make up an ensemble, in the same sense that a bunch of cows make up a herd.

The ensembles are remarkably consistent in their projections of temperature. They are less consistent at projecting dynamic weather, such as thunderstorms.

The Oxford group runs its climate models thousands of times. Some runs resemble our present-day planet; others are closer to the Earth of the 18th century. Worlds of extremes unfold, governed by the chaos of the climate system. In some worlds, a heat wave will scorch Europe. In others, the continent basks in a pleasant summer.

Otto and her colleagues count how often the weather event of interest occurs in a warmed world compared with 18th-century Earth. Statistics reveal whether humans played a role and how frequently the event could recur.

""We’ve demonstrated that it is doable with easy-ish events,"" Otto said.

This approach works less well for complex weather, according to some scientists.

After the Colorado floods in 2013, Martin Hoerling, an atmospheric scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, and his colleagues found that climate change has decreased the likelihood and strength of heavy rainfall in northern Colorado.

The findings made news: ""2013’s flood-triggering rains not caused by climate change,"" proclaimed Boulder’s Daily Camera.

The headlines provoked Kevin Trenberth, an atmospheric scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who, like Hoerling, is stationed in Colorado. But they’re miles apart on how much to blame humans for extreme weather. Trenberth believes many attribution studies tend to underestimate people’s impact on the climate. To him, almost every event is influenced by our emissions.

Trenberth says, and some scientists agree, that attribution studies that use climate models do not work well for weather events that are local and dynamic—a flash in the pan. These include wildfires, hurricanes, hail and thunderstorms. In some cases, they include droughts and heavy rainfall.

When models do not find a fingerprint of human-caused climate change for a particular event, this does not mean that humans are off the hook, Trenberth said.

""The issue always is, how good is the model, how realistic is the model compared with the real world?"" he said. ""With some of the work that is being done in the U.S., especially with regard to NOAA, a lot of the stuff which is being done is too heavily oriented toward the model, and the model isn’t good enough. As a result, the statements are not reliable for the real world.""

Attribution scientists are aware of the limitations, of course. They choose their models carefully, layer different approaches and stress the limits of their knowledge. They often emphasize caveats with statements like, ""It is a single model, or a single methodology."" But sometimes, they don’t.

The general public probably does not understand the nuance, acknowledged Stephanie Herring, an attribution scientist at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information.

""To come out and say, as Hoerling et al. did, that they could not find a role for climate change in the Colorado flood, I think, too often gets interpreted as, there was no influence of climate change in the Colorado flood,"" she said.

There is hope that attribution of hurricanes and other dynamic weather events will improve as scientists tinker on climate models, said Adam Sobel, a climate scientist at Columbia University.

""The models get better pretty fast, the computers get better pretty fast,"" he said. ""It does not only depend on that, but that is one factor that could change things more quickly.""

Attribution: proving climate change or disproving it?

Trenberth published his concerns in Nature last year. He wrote that scientists should not ask whether human actions have changed the likelihood of a particular storm happening in the future.

He suggested that scientists should instead study how the features of a particular storm, such as the amount of rain it dumps, was affected by global warming, he said.

""Given that we’ve got a storm, what was the impacts of humans on the resulting temperature and the precipitation?"" Trenberth said in an interview.

For instance, in the case of Superstorm Sandy, which hit the Northeast coast in 2012, Gary Lackmann, a scientist at North Carolina State University, analyzed the question: Given the storm happened, did climate change make it worse? He found that global warming may have modestly affected the storm track and intensity of Sandy.

Most attribution scientists have resisted Trenberth’s approach. It is based on simple rules of thumb that guarantee a role for man-made global warming in the extreme event, said Dáithí Stone, an attribution scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Sometimes, humans simply do not play a role in extreme weather, he said.

""It is quite plausible that we have not affected any characteristics of the storms on the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S.,"" he said. ""That is a possible result of the analysis—and I think it is important to recognize that that is a result.""

Another drawback is that Trenberth’s approach gives qualitative results, which are not very useful for policymaking, said Herring at NOAA.

""To simply tell a water resource manager that, ‘Oh, yeah, climate change is making heavy precipitation events more likely,’ is not particularly helpful information,"" she said. ""Does that really change our decisionmaking?""

Hoerling thinks the controversy about attribution is myopic. Climate scientists study extremes in order to better understand the climate system, with the ultimate goal of generating more accurate weather forecasts, he said. The best way to do that, he thinks, is to use traditional approaches.

""The various factors that cause an extreme [event] are part of our ongoing studies of weather—what causes weather to be extreme,"" he said. ""Has there been a new factor that materially changes how weather extremes happen? For heat waves, yes. For other events, I think that’s one of the challenges the science has moving forward.""

Shepherd of the University of Reading, who has collaborated with Trenberth, said that both approaches—traditional attribution and Trenberth’s—could be used in different contexts. Traditional attribution could be useful for analyzing heat waves, cold spells, droughts and heavy rainfall. The Trenberth approach could be used for hurricanes, wildfires, thunderstorms and such events, he said.

""I’d advocate that people try both and see which is more informative and find ways to combine them somehow,"" he said.

7,7,FL-2016-000064-CHN,Southeast Asia steelmakers bid to emerge from China's shadow - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-steel-idUSKCN0Z82SP,"HANOI/BANGKOK (Reuters) - As a construction boom spurs steel demand across Southeast Asia, countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand are challenging a flood of imports from China by retooling their steelmaking technology or imposing tariffs.

U.S. and European steelmakers are leading complaints over alleged dumping, but cheap Chinese imports account for two thirds of steel consumed in many Southeast Asian countries. The region includes six of the top 10 buyers of Chinese steel, and capacity utilization in its own mills has slumped to less than 40 percent.

While steel from China is expected to dominate for many years, swelling demand is driving efforts in countries like Vietnam and Indonesia to build more modern plants to better compete with China’s vast mills.

“China is a major force with huge supply dominating the world, but we have solutions to deal with it,” Tran Tuan Duong, general director of Vietnam’s biggest steel firm Hoa Phat Group, told Reuters.

Hoa Phat aims to triple production capacity to up to 6 million tonnes over 5-10 years using modern blast furnace technology.

The local unit of Taiwan’s Formosa Plastics Group has begun work on a $10.6 billion steel complex in Ha Tinh province with an initial annual crude steel capacity of 7 million tonnes, although this month’s planned start-up of the initial phase has been delayed by an environmental dispute.

TRADE TENSIONS

China has raised global trade tensions as its steel exports have soared, with surplus capacity estimated at more than 300 million tonnes, or triple Japan’s annual output.

Steelmakers in Southeast Asia have been hit hard as many of the region’s electric arc furnace plants, which use scrap as their raw material, are unable to compete with Chinese blast furnaces using far cheaper iron ore.

Many electric arc furnace plants have been idled and capacity utilization across the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) grouping has fallen to less than 40 percent from around 65 percent following a 2010 regional free trade agreement with China that cut tariffs on a raft of goods, including steel, said Roberto Cola, president of the ASEAN Iron and Steel Council.

Hoa Phat’s Duong said Vietnam could compete with other Southeast Asian countries.

“But the trade deal is plus C, which means including China, and all troubles come from that,” he said.

Vietnam was the second-biggest market for Chinese steel in 2015, with imports of 10.11 million tonnes, according to UK consultancy MEPS. Its own steel output that year stood at just 6.1 million tonnes, World Steel Association data showed.

“With Southeast Asia as a whole it’s a bit of a chicken and egg situation,” said MEPS analyst Jeremy Platt. “The cheap imported steel is benefiting their economic development, but it is hindering the ability to develop their steelmaking sector.”

TARIFFS RISE

Several countries are introducing tariffs to protect local industry.

Vietnam in March imposed temporary anti-dumping tariffs ranging from 14 percent to 23 percent on steel imports from China and elsewhere. It slapped additional import duties of up to 25 percent on more Chinese steel products that last until October 2019.

Thailand’s commerce ministry is working on the final draft of an anti-dumping law and expects to propose the draft for approval by end-2016, a spokeswoman said.

The moves come as local steelmakers hope to cash in on an expected jump in demand.

Indonesia and the Philippines face a huge backlog in infrastructure, said the ASEAN Iron and Steel Council’s Cola, with steel consumption in ASEAN forecast to reach 80 million tonnes by 2018 from 70 million tonnes last year.

Indonesia’s Krakatau Steel is building a blast furnace with a capacity of 1.2 million tonnes west of Jakarta, which it expects will be completed shortly.

Vietnam’s steel consumption surged 34 percent in the first five months of 2016, and demand is expected grow at more than 10 percent a year over the next decade as rapid economic growth fuels infrastructure development, said Hoa Phat’s Duong.

Steelmakers’ share prices have risen in anticipation. Vietnam’s Hoa Phat Group has climbed 35 percent this year, smaller rival Hoa Sen has gained 94 percent, and Krakatau Steel has rallied 123 percent.

In Thailand, steelmakers expect the first annual growth in demand in three years as the government begins work on over $50 billion in infrastructure projects. Shares of Tata Steel (Thailand) Pcl, have surged nearly 40 percent.

But this increased demand for bullion coins — like the American Eagle, South African Krugerrand and Canadian Maple Leaf — has created a golden opportunity for forgers.

Counterfeit coins are “flooding the market at an astonishing rate,” and compromising the investments of collectors, according to the American Numismatic Association (ANA).

“It’s a very serious problem and it’s really scary,” said Rod Gillis, ANA’s education director. “With improved technology, the fakes are getting better. It’s gotten to the point where even people who deal with coins all the time may not be able to recognize a counterfeit coin right away.”

Another veteran coin dealer agrees.

“There’s a reliable supply of bogus coins coming from China into the U.S., and it has been getting more authentic-looking over the years,” said Brad Karoleff, a veteran coin dealer who owns Coins Plus in Cincinnati. “At first, they were laughable, but as they’ve become savvier, they’ve been making counterfeits that look much more like the real thing.”

Get fooled and you could pay $1,300 or more for a counterfeit one-ounce gold piece that’s worthless. And you may not discover you’ve been taken until you go to sell it and a dealer tells you that coin is a fake.

“It is clear there is an increase in the types of fakes sold by unscrupulous dealers,” Dana Samuelson, president of the Professional Numismatists Guild, said in a recent news release warning about the growing problem. “These sales of counterfeit coins are potentially a multi-million dollar problem for the public.”

Coin dealers and pawn shops are also being targeted. Eric Hoolahan, CEO of Bellevue Rare Coins, with several stores around the Seattle area, says criminals are buying these knock-off coins and trying to sell them to stores that may not know how to spot a fake.

“It doesn’t cost them much, so they don’t need to get top dollar,” Hoolahan said. “Even if they get a pawn shop to pay them half the market price, they’re doing great.”

How they do it

Brian Silliman, who has an online dealership, Brian Silliman Rare Coins, has been to China and seen the counterfeiting operations there.

“They take the actual image of the coin, use a graphics program to touch it up and then they send it to an engraving machine that cuts the die. They’re doing it just like the Chinese mint does, but it’s not the mint,” Silliman told NBC News.

Most of the counterfeit coins are made from a base metal, like tungsten, that is plated with a little gold. This way it will pass the acid test that indicates gold. If it is well-made, the fake will weigh the same as the genuine piece, making it even harder to spot.

Coin expert Susan Headley recently noted in her post Inside A Chinese Coin Counterfeiting Ring on About.com that these counterfeiting operations are run like legal businesses. “There is no law in China against making these ‘replicas’ as long as they are sold as such,” she wrote.

There’s a new trick to fool buyers

William Gibbs, managing editor of Coin World, says some crooks are now putting their fake gold and silver coins into authentic-looking collector coin holders called slabs, complete with bogus bar codes and registration numbers. This makes it look like the coin has been authenticated by a reputable grading service.

“So even if you’re ordering a coin online that shows it’s in a slab from a reputable grading service, those holders could be fake,” said Gibbs said.

The only way to verify the slab is to call the grading company and give them the registration number.

Why isn’t something being done about this?

The Internet makes it easy for unscrupulous dealers to buy counterfeit gold and silver coins made in China.

“The bad guys are buying these fake coins by the hundreds on websites like Alibaba.com,” said Doug Davis, founder and president of the Numismatic Crime Information Center.

A lot of these fakes are then sold on eBay and Craigslist, or through newspaper ads that promise a great deal on gold or silver coins, Davis told NBC News.

It’s often difficult to get local police departments involved in these cases because they’re not coin experts and it’s often a challenge to decide if a crime has been committed.

Coin dealer Karoleff would like to see federal law enforcement agencies take a more proactive position.

“The Secret Service hasn’t been a lot of help trying to stem the tide of these fakes until recently, but as they become more and more realistic, we’re starting to get a little help,” he said. “Until we get more stringent penalties for the people caught passing these and producing them and importing them, it will continue.”

Protect yourself

Buying precious coins at a flea market or from an unknown seller has always been risky — even more so now.

If you want to buy gold coins, shop at a reputable dealer — whether that’s in person or online — that’s been in business for a while. You want a company that will guarantee what they sell you and stand behind it if there is a problem.

It could be cheaper to order from an unknown source, but that could wind up costing you thousands. And if you get burned, you’ll never get your money back.

“There’s an old saying that can help buyers avoid problems: If you don’t know coins, you better know your dealer,” said Dana Samuelson of the Professional Numismatists Guild.

Tonga is now drying out after several days of torrential rain. In the middle of what is supposed to be the dry season, the rain transformed the capital into a series of lakes.

A total of 273mm of rain was reported at Fua’amotu airport in the 24 hours up until 00GMT on Saturday. According to Tonga Meteorological and Coastal Radio Services, this is the highest June rainfall recorded in the past 36 years of records.

This is more than three times the average of 79mm that is expected in the entire month, and close to the amount of rain that fell from Tropical Cyclone Winston in February, which delivered 294mm of rain to Vava’u in 24 hours.

As well as torrential rain, the weather system also brought strong winds. According to Matangi Tonga Online, these winds tore down trees and power lines and a number of power cuts were reported in western Tongatapu, the main island of Tonga.

This is the same weather system that pounded eastern Australia over a week ago. The storm did major damage, causing coastal erosion and widespread flooding.

The wet weather has now eased across Tonga and the floodwater is expected to recede in the next few days.","Mon, 13 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/3dfd8553713145b2817fa1e19e0e2c7d_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['system', 'tonga', 'reported', 'weather', 'widespread', 'rain', 'week', 'torrential', 'cuts', 'winds', 'flooding', 'power', 'hit']",

11,11,FL-2016-000064-CHN,When Will China's “Heavenly Palace” Space Lab Fall Back to Earth? - Scientific American,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-will-china-s-heavenly-palace-space-lab-fall-back-to-earth/,"A Chinese space lab is bound to come back to Earth relatively soon, but when and where this happens is a matter of debate and speculation.

For example, some satellite trackers think China may have lost control of the uncrewed 8-ton (7.3 metric tons) vehicle, which is called Tiangong-1. That's the view of Thomas Dorman, who has been documenting flyovers of the spacecraft using telescopes, binoculars, video and still cameras, a DVD recorder, a computer and other gear.

""If I am right, China will wait until the last minute to let the world know it has a problem with their space station,"" Dorman told Space.com. [See photos of China's Tiangong-1 space lab]

""It could be a real bad day if pieces of this came down in a populated area … but odds are, it will land in the ocean or in an unpopulated area,"" added Dorman, an amateur satellite tracker who has been keeping tabs on Tiangong-1 from El Paso, Texas since the space lab's September 2011 launch. ""But remember—sometimes, the odds just do not work out, so this may bear watching.""

However, Chinese officials have yet to confirm the end-of-life plans for Tiangong-1, and some experts think it may still be possible to bring the spacecraft down in a controlled fashion.

Space station stepping stone

Tiangong-1—whose name means ""Heavenly Palace""—served as a stepping-stone toward a larger space complex that China wants to be operational in Earth orbit around 2020.

Tiangong-1 was used to perform docking exercises during a series of missions—the uncrewed Shenzhou-8 mission in 2011 and the crewed Shenzhou-9 and Shenzhou-10 flights in 2012 and 2013, respectively.

Shenzhou-10's return to Earth in June 2013 marked the end of Tiangong-1's docking duties. The Heavenly Palace then entered an in-orbit ""operation management phase,"" undergoing changes in its flying mode, orbit-maintenance maneuvers and other activities.

Earth observation, and end of the line

According to the China Manned Space Engineering (CMSE) office, Tiangong-1 is also outfitted with payloads such as Earth observation instrumentation and space environment detectors.

""Tiangong-1 has obtained a great deal of application and science data, which is valuable in mineral resources investigation, ocean and forest application, hydrologic and ecological environment monitoring, land use, urban thermal environment monitoring and emergency disaster control. Remarkable application benefits have been achieved,"" CMSE officials wrote in a 2014 statement.

For example, Tiangong-1 provided timely data across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum during China's Yuyao flood disaster in 2013, and collected imagery of a devastating Australian forest fire as well, CMSE officials have said.

Earlier this year, however, state-run news agencies in China reported that the CMSE had terminated Tiangong-1's data-gathering activities. Furthermore, CMSE officials explained that the telemetry link to the space lab had failed, seemingly dooming the vehicle to an uncontrolled fiery fall in the future.

Dorman said his observations support this looming scenario. And it makes sense to Dean Cheng, a senior research fellow at the Asian Studies Center at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based conservative think tank. [6 Biggest Spacecraft to Fall Uncontrolled From Space]

Cheng said he's surprised that Chinese space authorities have not declared exactly when Tiangong-1 will come back to Earth, even though its operational life seems to be over.

""That would seem to suggest that it's not being deorbited under control,"" Cheng told Space.com. ""That's the implication.""

Whatever the true status of the space lab, Cheng said, there are some interesting implications.

""When you deorbit somewhat larger items, you would have a 'best practices' policy of making a controlled re-entry,"" Cheng said. ""In fact, this will be an interesting test of whether or not China is going to be more open about its space program writ large.""

Cheng said that providing the world with an idea of when and where 8 tons of space hardware will fall back to Earth ""would be consistent with a more open space policy … and frankly would be an act of responsible behavior.""

Other possibilities

Such speculation does not mean that Tiangong-1 is definitely out of control, other experts cautioned.

""It seems it may be much ado about nothing,"" said T.S. Kelso, a senior research astrodynamicist at the Center for Space Standards & Innovation (CSSI), a research arm of Analytical Graphics.

Kelso has plotted the altitude history of Tiangong-1 from just after its launch to more recent times. He told Space.com that the Chinese space lab's orbit was reboosted relatively recently, in mid-December 2015.

""That reboost put it higher than it had been anytime prior to that in its mission,"" Kelso said.

Kelso said he does not have ""any direct way to measure"" Tiangong-1's stability. ""But we might expect to see the rate of decrease in altitude—the slope between reboosts— increase if it was tumbling, since the station would have higher drag,"" he added. ""Instead, we see the slowest decrease in altitude in recent years—consistent with the lower drag at a higher altitude.""

Kelso said his reading of the data suggests that Tiangong-1 is dormant but stable.

""So that might be why the Chinese aren't responding … they probably don't understand why they would need to,"" Kelso said. ""I guess I would want to see some very specific data, notionally covering a period where Tiangong-1 was supposed to be stable, to show that it is now uncontrolled, before reading too much more into this.""

Based on the latest tracking information, if there are no further reboosts of the Chinese craft, ""we would expect to see Tiangong-1 re-enter just around the end of 2017,"" Kelso said.

If China does indeed have control over the space lab, why keep it in orbit rather than nudging it back to Earth immediately?

""The suggestion has been made,"" Dorman said, that ""the reason China hasn't done a re-entry of Tiangong-1 is, the space station is low on fuel, and China is waiting on a natural decay to a much lower orbit before they can do a burn to bring the station down.""

Next moves

Meanwhile, China plans to launch the Heavenly Palace's successor, Tiangong-2, this September. A month later, the crewed Shenzhou-11 mission is scheduled to dock with Tiangong-2.

In 2017, the maiden flight of China's robotic cargo ship, Tianzhou-1, will dock with Tiangong-2. This supply ship is to be boosted by the Long March 7, a new Chinese rocket slated to debut this year.

China's state-run Xinhua news outlet has reported that the core module of the nation's 60-ton, medium-size space station—due for launch around 2018—will be named ""Tianhe-1,"" a Chinese word for ""Milky Way"" or ""galaxy.""

Wang Zhongyang, of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp., said two space labs will be launched later and dock with Tianhe-1, according to Xinhua. Wang added that construction of the space station ""is expected to finish in 2022,"" Xinhua reported.

Wang pointed out that China also intends to launch a space telescope akin to NASA's iconic Hubble Space Telescope soon after the space station is operational. This telescope will ""be in a separate space unit and share orbit alongside the space station,"" Xinhua reported.

“The landscape we confront today is far more complex and diverse, less dominated by Chinese activity and increasingly populated by a range of other criminal and state actors,” said the report by FireEye’s iSIGHT Intelligence unit.

U.S. officials said late last year that the Chinese military had scaled back its economic cyberespionage against American companies following the indictments.

[Following U.S. indictments, China scales back hacks on American industry]

The firm’s report, however, is based on an analysis over three years of 262 intrusions into the networks of companies and government agencies that hired the firm to investigate both in the United States and overseas.

It found that Chinese activity is markedly down overall — from more than 60 intrusions in February 2013 to a handful in April of this year. It also found that some activity has shifted away from the United States to targets in Asia, including Taiwan, India and Japan.

The shifts have coincided with ongoing political and military reforms in China, FireEye noted. Since taking power in late 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has worked to centralize China’s cyber operations, turning them toward support of a greater range of activity, the firm said. That redirection takes place as the U.S. military is building up its Cyber Command in support of defensive and offensive operations to benefit regional military commands as well as protect the nation.

In September, Xi pledged that his country would not engage in state-sponsored commercial cyberespionage — the theft of intellectual property and trade secrets from one country to benefit another country’s own industries.

FireEye found that the trend line was already sloping downward by the time Xi made his pledge, although the activity has not completely stopped. The firm has investigated a number of intrusions of corporate networks in the United States, Europe and Japan.

Laura Galante, FireEye director of threat intelligence, points to several reasons for the downturn. In early 2013, the cybersecurity firm Mandiant issued a report describing in detail the activities of one prolific hacking unit from the People’s Liberation Army, Unit 61398. Mandiant is now owned by FireEye. That unleashed a flood of other reports outlining Chinese cyber operations.

In May 2014, the Justice Department obtained indictments against five Chinese army officers in commercial cyberespionage, marking the first time the U.S. government had charged foreign government personnel with such crimes.

In August 2015, The Washington Post reported that the Obama administration was developing economic sanctions to apply against Chinese companies and individuals who benefited through the cybertheft of U.S. companies’ intellectual property.

Taken together, Galante said, these events probably influenced the change in China’s behavior.

The analysts did not distinguish in their research between commercial and political espionage. The latter includes, for example, the Chinese government hack of the Office of Personnel Management, which U.S. officials have said was done more for classic spying purposes of gaining information that can be used to blackmail government employees or recruit them as agents.

They also did not analyze whether intrusions were directed by military or intelligence agencies. The Post reported last year t hat the Ministry of State Security , an intelligence and security agency, probably was behind the OPM hack. Other researchers have detected more activity coming from the ministry rather than the Chinese army.

“The volume has gone down so much that at least it’s clear that there’s a higher cost to operating in cyberspace” for the Chinese, Galante said.

18,18,FL-2016-000064-CHN,China's Fashion Lovers Embrace Local Traditions for Style Made 'With Heart' - Jing Daily,https://jingdaily.com/chinas-fashion-lovers-embrace-local-traditions-for-style-made-with-heart/,"Tucked away in a Beijing alleyway, the artsy studio and boutique of fashion designer Kathrin von Rechenberg stands out in a city filled with shiny new malls and mega-brand flagships. Her intricate, contemporary silk pieces in earthy colors are created using a fabric-dyeing technique which dates back to the Ming dynasty called xiangyunxia, or tea silk.

When she made the unlikely decision over a decade ago to leave the global fashion capital of Paris for Beijing after working with couture fashion houses including Dior, Christian Lacroix, and Chanel, she had her work cut out for her in convincing China’s newly wealthy consumers to take interest in the ancient fabric. Starting her label Rechenberg in 2004, the designer was attracting almost exclusively expats as China’s new rich were developing their love affair with brands like Louis Vuitton and Gucci.

“No Chinese was interested in the xiangyunxia,” she says. “The only Chinese clients I had at that time were from Hong Kong, from Taiwan, overseas Chinese.” The tea silk was regarded as too “old-looking” or too much like something their grandmother would wear, she says.

Over a decade later, it’s a different story—more than half of her customers are mainland Chinese as tastes are quickly evolving in China’s fashion market. “Recently, the Chinese consumers have been looking for this kind of stuff,” she says. “It’s really a complete change.”

Not long ago, the concept of “luxury shopping” in China was synonymous with top European mega-brands and not much else. As the country’s economic growth attracted a flood of international labels, traditional Chinese designs and materials were overshadowed by all that was flashy, new, and foreign. But as the market matures, local styles, fabrics, and products are seeing both a renaissance and reinvention thanks to demand from a sophisticated clientele seeking out unique styles and craftsmanship.

These days, major international luxury companies and small boutiques alike are embracing materials and designs from China and neighboring regions in increasingly sophisticated and inventive ways. One of the biggest examples of this is the Hermès-backed fashion and lifestyle label Shang Xia, which uses China- and Asia-sourced materials to make handcrafted designs inspired by Chinese culture. Its designer Jiang Qiong Er is focused on reviving the idea of a “renaissance of Chinese fine living” with items such as Han dynasty-inspired clothing made from a traditional Mongolian style of cashmere felt-making, Jingdezhen porcelain, traditionally woven bamboo, and Ming dynasty-inspired zitan wood furniture.

Meanwhile, LVMH has bet big on high-end Pu’er tea with its new Chinese beauty and lifestyle brand Cha Ling, which sells skincare products from forest-grown tea leaves harvested in China’s Yunnan province, as well as tea leaves for drinking, traditional clay teapots, and ceramics. The brand was started by Guerlain’s CEO after he went on a trek through the region in search of orchid varieties for skincare ingredients.

Cashmere harvested in Mongolia and China is also becoming particularly localized. For example, the $9.5 billion Chinese cashmere brands Erdos, which used to act as a supplier for Hermès, Burberry, and Loro Piana, no longer supplies these brands and has now shifted its focus to its own China stores, launching a luxury label called 1436 in 2014.

Yak wool from the Tibetan plateau is making its way into China’s fashion world as well. In addition to the tea silk items, von Rechenberg also produces yak wool clothing with fabric sourced from Norlha, a brand created by a French-Tibetan husband-and-wife team that employs nomads in the western province of Gansu to produce scarves, clothing, and other textiles out of the material. Originally focused almost exclusively on Europe and the United States and popular with celebrities such as Tilda Swinton, Norlha now sees about half of its sales from China through e-commerce, local pop-ups shops, and its boutique and eco-tourism camp in Gansu.

Tea silk is especially challenging to work with, says von Rechenberg. The labor and time that go into creating each piece make it an inherently niche operation—which is what is now making it even more appealing to Chinese luxury shoppers in search of something truly unique. “It’s not very useful if you want to use it in bigger quantities,” she says. The hand-dyeing process takes place in a traditional Pearl River Delta workshop—one of the last places using the technique. The silk is infused with natural dyes made from yam between 25-30 times and dried in the sun before the final step, when it is covered in river silt before dawn to create a reaction with the dye’s tannins. The mud is washed out, and the silk must be kept for a minimum of two years before it can be used to make clothing.

As a perfectionist, von Rechenberg opts to store the fabric for five or six years after dyeing. Working with the silk once it’s ready is also painstaking: fabric can’t be cut through the middle, and stitching requires absolute perfection the first time—“if you make a mistake and rip it off, there will be stitch marks.”

The interest in natural, locally produced fabrics and styles is occurring after a long period of dormancy. For example, the practice of dyeing tea silk was on the verge of extinction by the time von Rechenberg arrived in the city. “The first tea silk that I bought was in a very old shop at Qianmen,” in Beijing, she says, explaining that she purchased vintage fabric woven in the 1960’s and dyed in the 80’s because production of new tea silk had stopped.

But the concept of “vintage” fashion simply meant something used and cast away to newly wealthy Chinese consumers. Meanwhile, the bespoke tailoring offered by her shop was also considered an unwanted relic of the past. “Going to a tailor was nothing special for them, because as a kid, they had no choice. If they wanted new clothes, they went to the tailor.” She says that going “to the shopping mall was much “more interesting than going to a tailor.”

When asked why there has been such a rapid change in such a short time span, she says, “Our clients, most of them have gone through the stage of buying the name brands. They don’t want that anymore. They all complain that the quality of the international luxury brands is going down.” She notes that her mainland Chinese customers are mainly professional women and entrepreneurs with not only money to spend, but also a strong sense of what they want and desire to stand out from their peers.

Business is growing as she relies mainly on word-of-mouth and small fashion shows for VIP clients for promotion. When asked what she thinks Chinese clients want out of a small fashion brand, she says there’s more demand nowadays for fashion that’s “more individual, more unique—something made with heart. I think that’s what’s missing in today’s world.”

According to her, the era in which local, natural materials and traditional craftsmanship were tossed aside is now a thing of the past itself. “I think our time has come now.”","Wed, 22 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://jingdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/石榴皮3-1024x683.jpg,"['heart', 'chinese', 'style', 'fashion', 'local', 'china', 'traditions', 'von', 'traditional', 'luxury', 'rechenberg', 'embrace', 'fabric', 'tea', 'chinas', 'silk', 'lovers']", 
19,19,FL-2016-000064-CHN,China's Maritime Militia - Foreign Affairs,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2016-06-23/chinas-maritime-militia,"Last October, when the American destroyer USS Lassen sailed by Subi Reef, an artificial island built by China in the South China Sea, a number of Chinese merchant ships and fishing boats maneuvered around it, apparently having anticipated its approach. The Lassen was on a freedom of navigation operation, meant to demonstrate the United States’ commitment to maintaining open access to the area, much of which China claims as its own. China was using an unusual resource to broadcast its opposition to the trip: ships that appeared to be crewed by civilians, but in all likelihood were actually controlled by state-sponsored forces taking orders from China’s military.

To promote its disputed claims in the South China Sea, China is increasingly relying on irregular forces such as these, which together form what China calls its maritime militia. In recent years, maritime militia units have played important roles in a number of encounters and skirmishes in international waters: in 2012, for example, they participated in China’s seizure of the Scarborough Shoal from the Philippines, and in 2014, they helped China repel Vietnamese ships from an oil rig that China had stationed near the contested Paracel Islands.

The militia units help China take the initiative in encounters with foreign forces.

The militia represents a useful tool in China’s plan to bloodlessly press its maritime claims, since its frequently civilian appearance allows Beijing to deny its involvement in encounters such as last October’s and exploit the U.S. Navy’s rules of engagement, which limit the actions U.S. ships can take against civilian vessels. Despite its potency, the maritime militia is the least understood of China’s sea forces, and so far, the U.S. government has not acknowledged its existence in public reports or major official statements. That should change. By showing Chinese leaders that it is wise to their game, Washington could discourage Beijing from using the militia even more assertively than it has so far—a crucial step in preventing China from asserting control over a vital waterway that should remain open to international traffic.

A MILITARY IN DISGUISE

A number of countries have maritime militias that contribute to law enforcement, disaster recovery, local security, and other such tasks. The United States, for example, has modest naval militias that help deal with emergencies in undisputed coastal waters and provide reservists to the country’s other military services. But Beijing’s maritime militia is different: with thousands of members, it is the world’s largest, and it is one of only two, along with Vietnam’s, known to send elite irregular forces to harass legally operating foreign vessels.

The maritime militia units are managed by local PLA military commands and are funded by local and provincial governments. To encourage locals to join up, municipalities often promise to pay militia personnel a pension equal to several thousand dollars per year if they are disabled in the line of duty—a sum comparable to other Chinese government pensions and an attractive draw in a rural fishing village. Hainan, the Chinese island province that claims administration over most of the South China Sea, is home to many of the most advanced units, some of which Chinese officials, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, have visited.

Maritime militia units are designed to look like civilian groups in most contexts, and they have considerable leeway to decide when to use the military uniforms in which their members usually train. A January 2014 article in China’s official military newspaper, PLA Daily, neatly captures the intended effect: “Putting on camouflage, they qualify as soldiers; taking off the camouflage, they become law-abiding fishermen.” Of course, these are no ordinary fishermen. Members of the militia report to the People’s Liberation Army and other government elements, and their missions are mandated and sponsored by the Chinese state. What is more, according to authoritative Chinese government and military-affiliated publications, some of China’s most advanced maritime militia units—the same ones that would likely be entrusted with missions requiring contact with U.S. and other foreign forces—are trained by PLA Navy officers.

Indeed, in a number of international encounters over the past few decades, members of the maritime militia have closely coordinated their actions with China’s navy and coast guard. Perhaps the most infamous episode came in 2009, when a crewmember on a fishing trawler—piloted by a militia member and registered to a militia organization—attempted to use a grappling hook to snag the sonar array of a U.S. surveillance ship, the USNS Impeccable, after the trawler, two Chinese coast guard vessels, and another apparently civilian boat forced the Impeccable to a halt by cutting across its bow—all as a PLA Navy warship watched nearby.

Despite the fact that the Impeccable incident and other such encounters have been widely publicized, the militias are strikingly deceptive about their activities. Earlier this month, an Al Jazeera reporter visited the township of Tanmen on Hainan, where she saw a contingent of fatigue-clad militiamen drilling by the village's harbor. Asked what they were doing by the reporter, a local official said that the men were members of a film crew. A man who said he was a local fisherman but was later identified as the Tanmen militia's deputy commander went further: he knew nothing about the men drilling by the harbor, he claimed, apart from the fact that they were fishermen wearing military uniforms for the innocuous purpose of protecting themselves from the sun.

The measure of deniability afforded by its civilian camouflage is not the maritime militia’s only advantage. The militia units also provide China with an asymmetrical advantage and help it take the initiative in encounters with foreign forces: as foreign ships grapple with how to respond, the militia units can interfere with their operations while reporting their location and activities to other Chinese forces. And then there is the propaganda value: in the event of an encounter between the militia and foreign ships, Chinese outlets might flood the Internet with a selectively edited footage of apparently civilian fishermen being unjustly victimized. Of course, members of the maritime militia are not mere civilians, and their direct connections to China's military chain of command, from which they receive mobilization and operational orders, should disqualify them from being treated as such.

GETTING IN FRONT OF THE PROBLEM

Observers should not expect the maritime militia to ease off its activities anytime soon. China's drive to coerce its neighbors in the South China Sea is growing, and its ongoing development and fortification of artificial islands in the region will provide the militia with plenty of support. At the same time, Beijing's efforts to streamline the People's Liberation Army by cutting 300,000 troops will provide plenty of fresh equipment and manpower for the militia: veterans are highly attractive recruits. Responding to signals from Beijing, local officials along China’s coastline are expanding existing militia units and establishing new ones. Consider Beihai, a city in China's southern Guangxi Province. In 2013, that city was home to two maritime militia detachments, with around 200 personnel. In 2015, it boasted at least ten detachments and more than 2,000 personnel.

Before another incident involving China’s maritime militia and U.S. forces occurs, Washington needs to get in front of the problem. It should start by publicizing its awareness of the dangers posed by the militia by, for example, ensuring that the Department of Defense's annual report on China's military covers the group extensively in 2017. U.S. officials should openly discuss the militia's attributes, its uses, and the consequences that it and other Chinese government actors would face in a variety of scenarios involving U.S. forces, making clear that the maritime militia won't stop the United States from pursuing legal access to the South China Sea. Doing so would bolster transparency in a crisis-prone region and help to establish clear off-ramps to avoid escalation in the event of a dangerous encounter. Even if Chinese officials decline to discuss the issue with their American counterparts, Washington's message would still resonate in Beijing.

The PLA Navy, for its part, should not be allowed to present itself as China's good cop by cooperating with U.S. forces in the region at the same time that China's coast guard and maritime militia (some of which the PLA Navy trains) do the dirty work. Instead, Washington should call on China's coast guard and maritime militia to adhere to the same code of conduct as the PLA Navy. And so that the proper rules govern all irregular forces in the region, the United States should also ask Vietnam to make its own maritime militia adhere to similar standards.

If China does not cooperate, the United States should consider revoking some of the privileges that the PLA Navy currently enjoys with U.S. support, such as its participation in the U.S.–hosted Rim of the Pacific naval exercise. By calling out the maritime militia's activities, imposing costs for its employment, and preparing for the various contingencies it might provoke, Washington can get ahead of the serious challenge posed by Beijing's irregular sea forces in one of the world's most volatile regions.","Thu, 23 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn-live.foreignaffairs.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large_1x/public/public-assets/images/articles/2016/06/23/rtr383gz.jpg?itok=r_9ZPISj,"['forces', 'chinese', 'pla', 'units', 'china', 'navy', 'military', 'maritime', 'militia', 'chinas']",

Preventing large amounts of water from entering subway stations is a persistent problem. In New York City, where the flooding from Hurricane Sandy caused serious and persistent damage, there have been all sorts of experiments to try and prevent it. Solutions come in the form of covers that would attempt to close off all the entry ways to a given subway (though it is hard to blocks every vents other small cracks) to giant plugs that would fit into tunnels to try and stop the worst of the damage.

Clearly, serious solutions such as these also close the station or even disrupt an entire line, which makes it a big choice to pull the trigger on and means it's only an option for really serious emergencies.

In the case of Cleveland Park, the station only needed to be closed for two hours to pump out the water, and the train lines carried on mostly uninterrupted, leaving commuters with wet feet and some inconvenience, but some seriously surreal footage to make up for it.

But China is actually conducting some fascinating experiments with the Internet (see “The Best and Worst Internet Experience in the World""). You just need to look outside the tech sector to notice them.

The most significant innovation is happening not among Chinese Internet companies but in the country’s so-called “real” economy. Corporations in old-school sectors like construction, agriculture, transportation, and banking are pursuing new business models based on big data, social media, and the Internet of things.

These are some of the largest firms of their kind in the world, yet many are young enough to be helmed by their original owner/founders. They’re like ­Rockefeller, Ford, or Carnegie with access to smartphones.

So it’s China’s largest residential-­property developer—not a tech company—that is pioneering the integration of Internet-based technology and services into fully wired communities. Vanke wants to create urban hubs that supply residents with gardens, safe food, travel, entertainment, and medical and educational services, all enabled by the Internet.

China’s insurance and banking industries have also embraced the Internet. Firms like Ping An Insurance recognized early on the opportunity to build customized models for risk assessment based on information gleaned from 24/7 tracking of physical and online activities.

Regulatory and finance structures in the West militate against this kind of experimentation, but China’s corporate culture encourages the broad reach. Asia specializes in big-tent conglomerates with protean areas of interest: a boat maker goes into semiconductors; a snack vendor might have an automotive division. In China, every big company can be an Internet, software, or device company, too.

China’s tech companies are similarly uninhibited. Xiaomi, a handset manufacturer, has taken a global leadership position in deploying the Internet of things. Tencent founded the online-only WeBank, which analyzes data from hundreds of millions of WeChat users to assess risk and extend small consumer loans without loan officers or physical branches. Alibaba is using its unprecedented knowledge of small business to provide financial services with an information advantage that no traditional bank has.

If Google did banking, these would doubtless be called the “Chinese banks of Google.” But it doesn’t—that’s the point. Information, entertainment, retail, and communication were the easy plays for U.S. companies, the real-economy sectors that the Internet could infiltrate without too much trouble. Chinese companies will be first to bring the Internet to the other realms of life and industry.

Then the West could be playing catch-up with the East.

As a result, China's economy was expected to grow by around 6 percent in 2017, the global emergency lender said in its China Review published on Tuesday.

However, as China was facing weak demand at home and abroad, the IMF said the medium-term outlook was ""more uncertain"" due to ""rapidly rising credit, structural excess capacity, and the increasingly large, opaque, and interconnected financial sector.""

The review was compiled by the IMF's first deputy managing director David Lipton, who said at the end of his visit to China that Beijing must address these vulnerabilities by decisively implementing ""pro-active and comprehensive"" policies in a number of sectors.

""Corporate debt, though still manageable, is high and rising fast,"" Lipton said, adding that solving the problem was imperative to avoid serious problems in future. For that, it was necessary to harden budget constraints, especially for state-owned enterprises, as well as to restructure or liquidate weak firms. The associated social costs must be addressed by the state, he added.

Need for fiscal reforms

In its report, the IMF also highlighted the need to align local government revenue and expenditure responsibilities, expand social security, implement new budget laws and make the tax system more progressive.

The IMF suggested implementing a carbon or coal tax, which would significantly reduce China's serious air pollution problem and could prevent between four and five million premature deaths in 2030.

In addition to fiscal reform, the IMF's David Lipton said China needed to guard against growing risks in its increasingly complex financial system by increasing coordination between different regulators and markets and strengthening funding resilience for both banks and other financial institutions.

Turning to China's foreign exchange policy - a concern for many investors after a surprise yuan devaluation last year - Lipton lauded regulators, saying exchange rate policy was becoming ""more flexible and market-based"". He encouraged China to set ""a goal of achieving an effective float within the next couple of years.""

Lipton also noted China had improved its data and communication of policies to markets and the public, and said further improvement would help China with its economic transition.

27,27,FL-2016-000064-CHN,Groundwater Pumping Sinks Beijing Region at Increasing Rate - Circle of Blue WaterNews,https://www.circleofblue.org/2016/world/groundwater-pumping-sinks-beijing-region-increasing-rate/,"Satellite data reveal the depths of the megacity’s thirst.

By Brett Walton, Circle of Blue

Beijing, one of the world’s most water-scarce large cities, has long drawn on groundwater reserves to supply more than 20 million people. The unrelenting pressure for water, though, is causing the land to shift and sink and buckle, which puts subway and high-speed rail lines, buildings, and other infrastructure at risk of damage.

If the region’s water-related land shifts, technically known as “subsidence,” go unchecked, severe consequences could be in store. Scientists at a railway engineering laboratory at Beijing Jiaotang University concluded in a September 2015 study that groundwater pumping must be restricted near completed high-speed rail lines and that new wells near the lines should be prohibited.

The trains, which reach speeds of more than 300 kilometers (186 miles) per hour, require stable tracks to keep the cars from derailing. The high-speed lines from Beijing to Shanghai and Beijing to Tianjin, a heavily populated port city, both pass through the Chaoyang subsidence zone east of Beijing. The researchers said that continued subsidence will have a “strong impact on the safety of train operation.”

According to satellite measurements, the Beijing region is sinking at an increasing rate as the soil of the North China Plain, like a sponge wrung dry, compacts around depleted aquifers. The data were published earlier this month in the journal Remote Sensing.

A common symptom of voracious groundwater use, subsidence is taking a toll on the world’s largest urban areas. More than 50 Chinese cities are grappling with uneven soils. In Southeast Asia, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, and Manila are all sinking. Parts of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, are dropping as rapidly as Beijing’s Chaoyang district.

Subsidence is a problem in the Americas, too. Mexico City is infamous for fractured building foundations that are a hallmark of sagging land. The industrial corridor along the Mississippi River Delta outside New Orleans is settling, increasing the flood risk, according to a NASA analysis published last month. In California’s Central Valley, where aquifer levels dropped to record lows recently because of drought-induced pumping, bridges and canals are cracking under the strain of subsiding soil.

Beijing’s Unstable Ground

Subsidence is “relatively minor” in Beijing’s center, averaging 10 millimeters (0.4 inches) per year between 2003 and 2011, according to researchers. But in Beijing’s eastern, outlying districts the problem is much worse. Parts of Changping, Shunyi, and Tongzhou experienced subsidence rates that were six to eight times higher. The deepest depression is in Chaoyang, where the maximum rate reached 110 millimeters (4.3 inches) per year.

Subsidence was first documented in the Beijing region in 1935, and numerous studies since then have connected the collapsing land to a rise in groundwater pumping. As much as two-thirds of the region’s water supply comes from groundwater. The Remote Sensing study used InSAR, which is a type of radar that monitors land elevation changes, and well data to look more closely at the geological factors that result in different rates of decline.

A number of factors are at play, including tectonic fault lines, soil types, and the location of groundwater wells. The researchers found that subsidence increases closer to wells and it increases in clay soils, which are finer-grained and thus more compactable — more like Play-Doh than beach sand.

Aquifers with larger soil particles tend to be more “elastic,” meaning that subsidence can be partially reversed when more water is stored. The researchers found such an example in one of the observation wells they used to check the satellite data. The vast majority of wells, however, were not elastic. The ground is permanently altered and the water-storing capacity of the aquifer is forever diminished.

Roberto Tomas, a study co-author and an engineering professor at the University of Alicante, in Spain, told Circle of Blue that a high rate of subsidence does not necessarily cause the most damage. What is important, he said is uneven subsidence.

“If part of a building settles and the other part is stable or presents a lower settlement, then the building suffers a distortion that causes internal stresses that can damage it,” he explained.

Tomas said that his research group is now conducting an analysis of how subsidence in the Beijing region is affecting critical infrastructure. That paper should be published by the end of the year, he said.","Wed, 15 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.circleofblue.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2011-12-China-Beijing-Choke-Point-AJaffe-IMG_9900-1030x687.jpg,"['lines', 'water', 'sinks', 'pumping', 'subsidence', 'region', 'study', 'groundwater', 'increasing', 'beijing', 'wells', 'rate', 'data', 'land', 'researchers']",

""We were a high-profile American company selling the Chinese products, and we attracted government attention,"" he says by way of explanation.

Shao, Shanghai-born but a U.S. citizen at the time of his arrest, was not allowed to return to this country until 2013. Today, the Stanford Graduate School of Business alumnus is in Houston, where he founded Sky Blue Butane, the only American company to manufacture butane fuel canisters.

Success in the Texas venture would bring both personal and professional satisfaction for Shao.

""If I prove myself successful in business, prove myself ethical in business, I prove they were wrong,"" he said recently at the company headquarters in an industrial area near Hobby Airport.

Shao, 54, came to the United States in 1986 to study educational technology at Rhode Island College. He later earned a master's degree at Stanford and began splitting his time between San Francisco and Shanghai, where he ran a company exporting U.S. medical imaging equipment to China. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1997.

He was among the first class of expatriates to try their hand at business in China, as the country's economy began to take off after years of strict central control. His business grew quickly until Shanghai officials came knocking at his door. Shao told tax auditors they could see the books, but after that he locked the door and refused to cooperate or pay a $50,000 bribe, he says.

His refusal, he says, landed him in more trouble with the authorities. They accused him of tax evasion and detained him at the Shanghai airport when he arrived on a flight from the United States.

Shao's staff called the U.S. Consulate when he didn't show up to work.

""Because I'm not white, I'm Chinese just like them, they didn't know they were holding an American citizen,"" Shao said. ""By that time it was too late. They were playing hardball.""

'A political chip'

For more than two years, Shao was held incommunicado. Eventually, he was convicted during a trial for which he couldn't prepare any defense and moved to a prison Shanghai uses for foreigners, which is separate from and nicer than the prisons for native-born Chinese inmates. There, he was able to communicate with the U.S. Consulate once a month and with his family still living in Shanghai.

His 1993 Stanford classmates began to advocate for him from the United States, completing a full Chinese audit of his company to prove the charges were meritless. Shao's case grabbed the attention of the Wall Street Journal. The State Department would occasionally tell reporters they were getting close to freeing Shao.

But every time the two countries seemed close to a deal, a setback in U.S.-China relations would stall the process. In 2001, a U.S. spy plane collided with a Chinese fighter jet, sparking an international dispute. In 2006, President George W. Bush refused to hold a state dinner for Chinese President Hu Jintao.

""I became a political chip,"" Shao said.

Shao was finally released weeks before the 2008 Olympics began, on the condition that he would stay in Shanghai for another five years and not talk to reporters about his case. Officially, he was charged with tax evasion and sentenced to 16 years in prison.

""His was one of the first really high-profile cases of a naturalized U.S. citizen of Chinese descent going back to the mainland, doing business and being detained and prosecuted,"" said Sophie Richardson, China director for Human Rights Watch. ""It was a surprise to the U.S. business community.

""The general expectation at that time was that expatriate businesspeople would be immune from the same kinds of questionable prosecutions and investigations that were rampant across the mainland. His was one of the first cases to show it didn't matter what passport you had, you could still be quite vulnerable.""

Shao's decade behind bars left him more determined than ever to succeed in business. After spending some time readjusting to American life, he began working as security analyst in Washington, D.C., where he researched Chinese manufacturing companies and monitored trends in the U.S. oil market.

Korea competitors

Around that time, Shao's friends held a dinner to welcome him back to the U.S. The meal was a traditional Chinese hot pot, whose preparation requires the use of a canister. In the midst of his work researching Chinese manufacturing, Shao noticed that the canister was made in Korea.

""That clicked,"" Shao said. ""Why are we importing Korean butane gas canisters when American oil prices are going to go down?""

As soon as oil prices slipped, Shao took action. He ran a feasibility study and set up a 14,000-square-foot factory in southeast Houston in April 2014. His Stanford classmates invested in the business.

Today, the factory employs seven workers on the butane canister line. Many of their products are made for Coleman, the camping company. They are sold across the U.S. and as close by as the local Target and Wal-Mart. Some are exported to Canada.

The pitch to buyers is simply that it costs less to produce the fuel canisters in the U.S., especially in Houston. Domestic regulations surrounding production of butane fuel canisters are more stringent than in other countries, leading to a higher quality product, Shao says. The company sources its butane gas from domestic suppliers.

Sky Blue Butane isn't aiming to take over the global butane canister market, which is dominated by three Korean companies, but to supply the relatively modest North American market. Of 500 million cans of butane gas consumed annually worldwide, the U.S. accounts for 20 million.

Right now, the plant is producing 3.6 million cans of butane gas a year, or nearly 20 percent of the U.S. market. Sky Blue Butane is planning to open a second factory in Houston within the next year.

Shao's eagerness to dive back into business after so much hardship motivates other Houston entrepreneurs.

""For the Asian community, it's inspiring,"" said Linda Toyota, president of Houston's Asian Chamber of Commerce.

Shao runs the business with help from Blake Turner, a recent Rice University graduate who serves as his chief operating officer. Turner appreciates the opportunity to help build a unique U.S. company.

""It's very rare to get the chance to help build an American manufacturing business in this day and age,"" he said.

For Shao, Sky Blue Butane is a way to succeed in a niche American market, and to show that his years behind bars didn't dull his business sense.

""I want to prove my business acumen is still there,"" Shao said. ""We're on track. If I prove the concept is right, that's my goal.""","Mon, 20 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.hdnux.com/photos/47/57/36/10418088/9/rawImage.jpg,"['shanghai', 'chinese', 'business', 'butane', 'prove', 'prison', 'houston', 'company', 'began', 'american', 'overcame', 'shao', 'hardships', 'entrepreneur']",

In Thailand, much imported electricity is used for air conditioning in shopping malls.

The Nam Tha, or Tha River, begins in northern Laos near the Lao-China border and runs southwest to join the Mekong just south of Huay Xay on the Lao-Thai border. In October 2014, I traveled by motorcycle and longtail boat up the Nam Tha, starting from its mouth at Pak Tha, to investigate a dam project on the river. Work on the dam’s access roads and other infrastructure had been underway for months, but no signs of construction were visible as I traveled—the banks were thickly forested, interspersed with patches of swidden agriculture, with occasional thatch villages where I stayed along the way.

The Nam Tha dam is being built by a subsidiary of the China Southern Power Grid, and 95 percent of the electricity it generates will be sold to Thailand. Scheduled to be completed in 2017, the dam will displace over 10,000 ethnic Lao and minority peoples, and during my visit the village Ban Hadmuark was being enlarged into a resettlement town for displaced villagers. (For details on the demographic impacts of the dam, see Olivier Evrard’s article “The Silenced River.”)

In February 2016 I returned to the Nam Tha to document the progress of the dam. This time I hitchhiked with a work truck driving in on the 37 kilometer access road from National Highway 3. I was stunned to discover that this stretch of the river had been transformed into a vast industrial plain, razed flat and crowded with cement trucks, lorries, earth movers, turbine parts, and scrap metal.

This photo essay starts with the Nam Tha as I experienced it in 2014, then switches to the way I encountered it in 2016. However, these images don’t convey the sense of violence that struck me when I entered the dam site a year and a half after seeing it in a nearly pristine state—the machinery, noise, ravaged hillsides, and clouds of dust raised up by gravel crushers, seemed limitless, on a scale to dwarf human individuals, communities, and aspiration.

Still, I hope these images serve in a small way to express the experience of peoples who have no voice or agency in the face of changes imposed upon them by international corporate interests and by their own governmental elite. Any form of protest can lead to police abduction and disappearance for Lao nationals in Laos—therefore, along with the advocacy of NGOs like International Rivers, this type of documentation may currently be one of the only means of dissent against hegemonic “development” which uproots and disenfranchises many for the benefit of a privileged, autocratic few.

India, China and Myanmar should establish a joint dialogue mechanism to restore the Stilwell Road connecting the three countries to revitalise trade in the region, Chinese media said on Thursday.

“The Stilwell Road was called the Ledo Road, but renamed after Stilwell at the suggestion of Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek. Ledo, a small town in northern India, is the starting point of this legendary road,” an article in the state-run Global Times said.

From Ledo in Upper Assam to Kunming in Southwest China’s Yunnan Province, the road is 1,800-km-long.

It is obvious that the road that connects China, India and Myanmar bears economic significance for South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia, it said.

“Driven by the economic potential and the need to reinforce transport network in the region, an increasing clamour of voices in China, India and Myanmar is calling for the restoration of the road. It is time for the three countries to deliberate over project,” it said.

“The road is not intact. China has completed the reconstruction of the section from Kunming to the Sino-Myanmese border and connected the road to China’s well-developed road system,” it said.

“With China’s help, Myanmar has also accomplished the section from the Sino-Myanmese border to Myitkyina. However, the sections from Myanmar to India and within India are barely usable. Some parts have already been deserted due to bad conditions,” it said.

“Myanmar has started to renovate part of the road, but the reconstruction is not smooth due to lack of funds and technologies and the presence of Indian and Myanmarese ethnic insurgents in the area,” it said.

“India is worried about the reconstruction of the road for two reasons. First, the road starts from Assam, a State where local militants have become increasingly active. Second, China-made products can flood into the Indian market through the road,” it said.

“But India has toned down the two concerns because New Delhi has adopted a Look East policy, and the process of advancing the strategy requires the stability of northern India, in which a well-functioning road system matters a lot. Thus, recently Assam has started to fix part of the road,” it said.

China as a “more developed country” should play a major role in the reconstruction work, it said.

“All three countries should set up a joint dialogue mechanism, in which their concerns and problems can be put on the negotiating table, including how to make peace with ethnic insurgents, and the three countries can find out solutions together. China can be the initiator of the communication mechanism,” it said.

“The restoration of the Stilwell Road will revitalise the promising path, which will interconnect Southwest China, South Asia and Southeast Asia, and merge the region into an emerging market.

“It is time for the three countries to deliberate over the project,” the editorial in the Global Times says, referring to the road built during the early 1940s, also called the ledo Road.

According to the daily, restoration of the Stilwell Road will revitalise the “promising path, which will interconnect South-West China, South Asia and South-East Asia, and merge the region into an emerging market,” said the daily, adding that it would also benefit the ethnic groups living in the area.

The road bears economic significance for South Asia, South-East Asia and East Asia, the daily said.

But it says that India “has toned down the two concerns” as it has adopted a “look East policy, and the process of advancing the strategy requires the stability of northern India, in which a well-functioning road system matters a lot”.

According to the editorial, the Indian economy has entered a stage of rapid development, and its rich deposit of resources in northern India demands a convenient and efficient transport system to draw in more foreign investment.

“A diversified investment environment will relieve India’s worry about the influx of Chinese products,” it said.

The editorial went on to say that all three countries should set up a joint dialogue mechanism, in which concerns and problems can be put on the negotiating table, including how to make peace with ethnic insurgents, and to find out solutions together.

It further suggested that “Considering that China is a more developed country than India and Myanmar, it should play a major role in the reconstruction work”.

The 1,726-km-long Stilwell Road starts in Assam and cuts through the Pangsau pass in Myanmar to Kunming in South China.

It touches almost all the important South-East Asian capitals.

The road was built by Chinese labourers, Indian soldiers and American engineers, and named after American General Joseph Stilwell who led the task and completed it in 1945 after three years of hard work.

35,35,FL-2016-000064-CHN,Paying more attention to the weather could help stretch our existing water supplies - PRI,https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-06-15/paying-more-attention-weather-could-help-stretch-our-existing-water-supplies,"Last year, New York City faced an unusual situation. An epic winter in the city’s Delaware River watershed brought heavy snow and very little rain. Stubborn cold meant there was no snowmelt to refill water-supply reservoirs, even as the city’s 9.5 million residents were draining them dry. A midwinter drought loomed.

Yet New York didn't have to put anyone through water rationing. In fact, relying on a new technique that uses modern weather prediction to fine-tune water supplies, the city continued drawing water from key reservoirs at normal rates while waiting for warmer weather.

Within weeks, all the city’s reservoirs began refilling with snowmelt.

“When we look back at how far we drew the reservoir down, it was historic,” says Jim Porter, the city’s chief of water system operations. “The only reason we did that was because of the confidence in these forecasts.”

Many other water managers are now looking closely at forecast-informed reservoir operations as a tool to stretch their water supplies. Amid pressures from climate change, population growth and environmental stress, advances in weather forecasting could be a cheap and effective way to keep vital reservoirs full while also boosting flood protection.

Managing Water More Intentionally

Dams and the water reservoirs they hold back are essentially like bathroom sinks. If the faucet discharges more water than the drain can handle, the sink will eventually overflow and ruin the floor.

But dams and reservoirs have an additional handicap: We can never be certain how much water nature will pour into the watershed upstream. And if too much pours in, it’s not just a floor that’s at risk, but the integrity of the dam holding back the water — and the safety of people living downstream if the dam bursts or levees are overwhelmed by high flows.

So engineers wrote dam operating rules — often embodied in water-control manuals — that dictate how much empty space must be maintained in reservoirs to contain floods. These usually depend on the season and local climate: More space in winter and spring, even if no storms are expected; less in summer and fall. In some cases, the rules also prevent operators from drawing reservoirs too low, in order to ensure enough water for urban and agricultural users and environmental requirements like adequate flows for fish. And engineers wrote the rules conservatively to handle uncertainty.

“We can’t afford to kill people because we want to save water,” says Mike Dillabough, chief of operations and readiness at the San Francisco District of the US Army Corps of Engineers.

But most large dams were built during a time when weather forecasting was rather crude, and although forecasting has improved significantly, the water-control manuals have not caught up. At most large dams, water managers are still required to fill and empty reservoirs according to the calendar, without regard to the weather.

This means, for example, that many California reservoirs had to dump precious water during the state’s recent historic drought, even when weather forecasts clearly showed no storms on the horizon to refill them.

“We need to manage our water resources in a much more intentional fashion, because it’s limited. It’s really tight here,” says Rob Hartman, hydrologist in charge at the California/Nevada River Forecast Center, a branch of the National Weather Service. “We don’t have to make decisions in the dark, and we shouldn’t be ignoring information that helps us do a better job.”

Still, Dillabough says, “we’re at the very beginning of [this]. We are still trying to figure out what modern science allows us to do.”

The big change

There was no single change in weather forecasting that made this change possible, Hartman says. Rather, it’s been a progression of developments in meteorology. Improved weather radar, satellite imagery and more powerful computer modeling of storms have all contributed.

In the past, Hartman says, the National Weather Service rarely released rainfall forecasts more than one day in advance. Now it can accurately forecast rainfall amounts five days out, and is experimenting with two-week forecasts. These are further computed into stream-flow forecasts for individual watersheds based on knowledge of temperature, soil moisture, snowpack and terrain. This means water managers can now get a runoff prediction for a particular reservoir up to a week in advance.

“We know, because weather forecasting is better, that the big storm is not coming tomorrow and it’s not coming the day after, either,” Hartman says. “So we don’t need to be in a place with reservoir storage to be able to handle that. We need to be able to get to that place a week from now should that big storm show up, but we don’t need to be ready for it today. That’s the big change.”

Operating with climate change

The US Army Corps of Engineers, the notoriously cautious agency that manages flood risk across the US, is in the midst of a multiyear, $22 million research project with numerous partner agencies to study whether forecast-informed operations can be applied at many of the reservoirs it oversees to improve both water storage and flood protection. Its pilot project — part of $2 million allocated this fiscal year — is Lake Mendocino on the Russian River in California’s wine country, and initial work suggests new procedures could boost water storage as much as 25 percent — a major improvement in drought-plagued California.

The approach is also being incorporated into operating rules at Folsom Reservoir, operated by the US Bureau of Reclamation near Sacramento, as part of a new flood-control spillway recently completed. The bureau was directed by federal legislation to use weather forecasting in its operation of the new spillway to maximize flood safety. The spillway allows the reservoir to be emptied faster in advance of a big storm, and the new rulebook will provide a framework for doing so.

“The work we’re doing encourages all of us that this is definitely worth pursuing,” says Jay Jasperse, chief engineer at the Sonoma County Water Agency, which relies on water delivered from Lake Mendocino. “It’s something that has got to be included at least in our long-term program, because optimizing these operations for more variable conditions is how we’re going to have to operate with climate change.”

Meanwhile, at the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, researchers are developing new prediction tools for so-called “atmospheric river” storms, which can deliver as much as 50 percent of an entire year’s rainfall in a few days. It was such a storm that brought record rain and flooding to parts of Louisiana in March.

Predicting exactly when and where such storms will strike is key to improving the flood safety aspects of forecast-informed operations, says Cary Talbot, associate technical director at the Army Corps Coastal Hydraulics Laboratory in Vicksburg, Mississippi.

For example, if a Monday forecast showed a huge storm arriving Friday, Lake Mendocino could release water much earlier than old forecasts would have allowed. As a result, it could release more water in a more gradual manner, limiting flood risk before and during the storm.

“We’re very excited about this. It does represent a significant step forward — a leap ahead, if you will — in our capability,” says Talbot, who is coordinating experts at two Army Corps labs working on the project.

It will take years to make this new approach mainstream. But the result could be a dramatic improvement in the operation of the United States’ dams — without having to pour a single bucket of concrete.

36,36,FL-2016-000064-CHN,"After legal-ivory experiment, black markets thrive from greater demand, less risk - Princeton University",https://www.princeton.edu/news/2016/06/14/after-legal-ivory-experiment-black-markets-thrive-greater-demand-less-risk,"To curb the destructive illegal ivory trade, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) announced in 2008 that it would suspend its ban on the international trade in ivory to allow a one-time legal sale of 108 metric tons of stockpiled ivory to China and Japan from four African nations. This partial-legalization was intended to flood the Asian market with legal ivory, driving black-market purveyors and the poachers who supply them out of business.

The move had the opposite effect, according to researchers from Princeton University and the University of California-Berkeley who have conducted a new analysis of the policy's global repercussions.

Since the announcement of the legal sale, illegal ivory production has increased by about 66 percent, while seizures of ivory being smuggled out of Africa have increased by approximately 71 percent, the researchers report in a working paper published June 13 by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The booming international black market for ivory — the United States is the second-largest market — is thought to have led to the slaughter of an estimated 100,000 elephants from 2011 to 2014.

Researchers from Princeton University and the University of California-Berkeley found that a one-time legal sale of 108 metric tons of stockpiled ivory that was intended to stifle elephant poaching in Africa actually expanded the black market for ivory and led to the slaughter of more elephants. The researchers found that the partial legalization stimulated new demand for ivory and made concealing illegal ivory easier.

The researchers found that the effects of the legal ivory sale actually expanded the black market for ivory and led to more elephant poaching in Africa. After the 2008 sale, observers reported that people's demand for ivory surged once it was legally available and had greater public visibility. At the same time, the presence of legal ivory in the market made it easier to conceal illegal ivory from the authorities — a phenomenon known as ""masquerading.""

These effects are not necessarily limited to ivory, the researchers said. Their work suggests that the partial legalization of some illegal products may in fact encourage black-market activity by attracting new customers who were previously unwilling to buy illegal products, and by reducing the risk to criminal groups — and thus the expense — of producing, transporting or selling those goods.

""The intuition that legalization will reduce illegal production is not always true,"" said co-author Nitin Sekar, an AAAS science policy fellow who initiated the study as a graduate student in Princeton's Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.

""The economic intuition was that if we allow the sale of some legal ivory in Japan and China, then there would be fewer people left to purchase it illegally. We found that that intuition was incorrect,"" said Sekar, who received his doctorate from Princeton in 2014. ""The black market for ivory responded to the announcement of a legal sale as an opportunity to smuggle even more ivory.""

The ivory market demonstrates that approaches to combating black markets need to be more nuanced than current policies, said co-author Solomon Hsiang, a Berkeley associate professor of public policy who started the project with Sekar as a postdoctoral researcher in Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.

Bids for legalizing illicit goods hinge on reducing prices so that illegal trade becomes unprofitable, Hsiang said. His and Sekar's work illuminates, however, that while prices may drop, so will expenses. At the same time, the customer base will likely increase as a once-stigmatized product becomes legally and socially acceptable.

""You can have a legalization event, you can have prices fall, but the production actually goes up. That's something that's not been appreciated,"" Hsiang said. ""We can't just assume legalization's going to have one effect. It's going to have three effects — some demand satisfied, a potential increase in the consumer base and reduced cost of smuggling. The balance of those effects is going to matter.

""I used to be a strong believer in legalization as a crime-reducing policy, but this has really forced me to rethink that,"" Hsiang said. ""Now, when people talk about legalization it may be smart in some cases, but in which cases is not as obvious. This is a case study for how wrong it can go.""

Since the 2008 legal sale, illegal ivory production has increased by about 66 percent, while seizures of ivory being smuggled out of Africa have increased by approximately 71 percent. The sale briefly opened ivory trade between China and Japan and four African nations (in dash outlines) — clockwise from left, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa.

George Wittemyer, a Colorado State University associate professor of fish, wildlife and conservation biology, said that the study aptly captures how real-world markets for wildlife products can be much more complex and unpredictable than economic approaches to conservation acknowledge — and how devastating it can be when those policies fail.

""As far as I've seen, this is probably the most robust and thorough approach to looking at [the 2008 sale] event,"" said Wittemyer, who is familiar with the research but had no role in it. ""There's a lot of nuance in wild-species trade in terms of the type of animal products people are using, if it can be harvested without harming the animal, what's being valued and the social stigmas attached.

""Using trade to conserve wild species is a really complicated social issue and it's hard to predict if it will be successful or not,"" he said. ""The fact that you're dealing with the persistence of a species means that if you make a mistake, and your assumptions are wrong, the cost can be extinction or large-scale extirpation. That to me is really important to consider and a paramount concern.""

If even partial legalization de-stigmatizes wildlife products and increases demand, as Sekar and Hsiang found, that could call into question the use of markets and legalization to control poaching, Wittemyer said.

""These economic mechanisms that we think are solutions can actually exacerbate the problems,"" he said. ""The level of demand for ivory is currently unsustainable. We think that trade is a solution where you introduce enough product to inundate demand, but the evidence we see for elephants is that demand exceeds supply. As for outright bans, there is evidence this worked to reduce demand in Western markets for elephant ivory.""

In the case of ivory, black-market activity rallied because the demand increased for a legal supply of a good that could not be legally or widely produced, Sekar said. In their paper, he and Hsiang noted that crocodile farms virtually eliminated the illegal trade in crocodile skins by adequately meeting demand.

Farms for elephants, rhinos, tigers and other slow-growing and wide-ranging species, however, are unfeasible. Thus, demand for products from these animals cannot be met through legal supplies. That demand may instead be met by exploiting the very limited and threatened natural populations, which are protected by law but prey to criminal gangs.

""Now that we have strong evidence that demand may actually go up for a product when you partially legalize it, the question is whether we are going to be able to meet that demand with legal versions of the product,"" Sekar said. ""If not, we can assume that consumers are likely to end up buying it on the black market anyway.""

For eliminating the black-market supply of products such as ivory, total bans on all trade, removal of the goods from the market (similar to firearms buy-back programs) and public campaigns aimed at reducing demand might be more effective than any form of legalization, Hsiang said.

""We saw that the poaching has remained high ever since the 2008 partial-legalization and part of it may be because ivory continues to circulate in the marketplace, providing cover to the illegal stuff,"" Hsiang said. ""To fix this, you probably want to either ban trade entirely, or you want to try to get the stuff off the market.""

On June 2, President Barack Obama issued a near-total ban on the sale within the United States of all products containing the ivory of African elephants. In the 1970s and 1980s, information campaigns about the brutality of ivory production helped reduce Western demand for ivory, and led to an international ban on the trade in 1989. Highlighting the need for a renewed public-awareness effort, Sekar and Hsiang cited research reporting that in China many people believe — wrongly — that ivory is taken without harming the elephant.

""It doesn't make sense to try to create a legal system for the ivory trade. In the most immediate sense, our study suggests that CITES resolutions proposing such trade should not be approved and that alternative means should be explored to help stem the poaching of elephants,"" Sekar said.

""We're not saying that legalization in general never works or that legalization always works,"" he said. ""We're saying the policy needs to be designed to fit the endangered species in question.""

The paper, ""Does legalization reduce black market activity? Evidence from a global ivory experiment and elephant poaching data,"" was published June 13 as a working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The work was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.","Tue, 14 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.princeton.edu,"['trade', 'demand', 'illegal', 'sekar', 'market', 'risk', 'sale', 'legal', 'thrive', 'black', 'hsiang', 'ivory', 'greater', 'legalization', 'experiment', 'markets', 'legalivory']",

Shanghai Disneyland is now officially open to the public.

Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger, along with Chinese officials, cut the ceremonial ribbon as Disney opened its twelfth theme park on Thursday morning in Shanghai. The dedication ceremony concluded three days of events to mark the opening of Disney's first theme park in mainland China.

During the ceremony, Iger read a letter of congratulations from U.S. President Barack Obama, while Chinese officials read a letter from the Chinese president. China's vice premier joked that the rain during the ceremony was a fortunate omen, as it represented a ""rain of U.S. dollars and RNB"" (China's currency). Certainly, both Disney and China are counting on Shanghai Disneyland generating substantial tourist spending for both the company and the region, as Disney and China have invested billions of dollars this jointly-owned development.

After the ribbon was cut, a flood of Disney characters appeared in front of the park's Enchanted Storybook Castle, and the park was opened to the tens of thousands of guests (including many overseas Disney fans) who had bought opening-day tickets.

In the days to come, we will have on-site trip reports from some of those visitors, and we welcome fans to rate and review the new Disney attractions on our Shanghai Disneyland page. In the meantime, you can enjoy the sights of Shanghai Disneyland with our video tour of top attractions and start planning your Shanghai visit with some of our tips and advice.

Hpa-an, Karen State Myanmar — From the snow-capped mountains of Tibet, the Salween rushes through spectacular gorges in Yunnan Province, then flows through four of Myanmar’s ethnic states before emptying into the Andaman Sea. This is the last great undammed river of East Asia.

Hydropower dams are proliferating across the globe with mega-dams being built in the Amazon, the Congo and along the Mekong. With 3,700 hydropower dams under construction worldwide, it is hard to find any important major river left that has escaped unscathed, and undammed. But so far the Salween’s pristine nature has surprisingly remained intact

Against the momentum of this global rush to build new dams, can the Salween River hang on to its cherished dam-free status and even become an ecotourism success story?

Ethnic leader Paul Sein Twa, the director of Kesan (Karen Environmental and Social Action Network), is convinced that his people, Myanmar’ Karen ethnic group, can both stop the dams and promote wildlife conservation in the Salween basin at the same time.

He told The Diplomat, “The Salween flows through four ethnic states in Myanmar. Our Karen people as well as other ethnic groups actively protect our river and indigenous people’s rights to use and manage the Salween River democratically. We try to protect this river from being degraded, and dammed,”

The Salween has already had a close call. All 13 dam projects on the river Nu (the Chinese name for the Salween) were suspended by then-Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in 2004, after two geologists had warned of the high risk that mega-dams could trigger a very strong earthquakes. The suspension also followed a campaign led by Kunming-based NGO Green Watershed.

In Yunnan, a provincial chief recently announced a plan to go beyond suspension with the idea to set up a new national park along the undammed river.

Downstream in Myanmar, 300 local Karen leaders, including representatives from three townships, decided to create a “Salween Peace Park” from a protected wildlife sanctuary where endangered species including leopards and tigers still roam. This remote area is protected by the KNU Karen National Union and their armed wing, the KNLA (the Karen National Liberation Army).

The Peace Parks Foundation envisages the establishment of a network of protected areas that links ecosystems across international borders.

The ethnic peoples living along the Salween are determined to resist all attempts to go ahead with the six dams approved by the- previous Thein Sein government in 2013.

These agreements, made with Chinese hydropower companies and Egat (Thailand’s Electricity Commission) without any parliamentary debate or public consultation, lack credibility, and could well be challenged by the new government.

Millions of voters from the ethnic states that helped to elect the new National League for Democracy (NLD) government are hoping that these dams will be cancelled on their stretch of the Salween.

Currently, the only guide to the energy policy of the new Aung San Suu Kyi–led government is their election manifesto, which pledged a critical review of hydropower projects and a more eco-friendly policy.

In the ethnic Shan State, rolling protests have been directed against a mega-dam project, the Mongton Dam. If built, it would become one of the biggest dams in Asia, with flood waters inundating vast swathes of Shan State, engulfing villages temples and much agricultural land with a projected reservoir area over 600 square kilometers.

The latest reports in the Thai media indicate that the Chinese and Thai investors have been pressured to redesign the goliath Mongton Dam into two smaller dams.

An Australian company, SMEC (the Snowy Mountain Engineering Corporation), appointed by the Chinese dam company to conduct the environmental and social impact assessments was greeted with a series of anti-dam protest by ethnic Shan communities in 2015. NGOs slammed the role of the company. “It is becoming apparent that SMEC’s (impact assessment) process is simply a sham, aimed to rubber-stamp the Mongton dam plans, rather than objectively assess the project’s actual impacts,” 16 Shan community-based groups said in a statement.

The Karen resistance to dams downstream from Mongton, including the Hatgyi Dam, is linked to an alternative vision for environmental conservation.

The area that has just been designated the Salween Peace Park is located in a thick forest along the border between Myanmar and Thailand. It is the refuge of some of Asia’s last indigenous peoples and endangered species, including tigers and the clouded leopard.

As Paul Sein Twa of Kesan explained, “The peace park is created to open up a democratic space for all parties to talk about the kind of peace people in Mutraw want. It is a roadmap to durable peace and steps towards a devolved federal union. Peace first, not big business development or big infrastructure projects first.”

Can the Karen achieve a fusion of peace, ethnic rights and wildlife protection?

Karen State is also the home to one of the longest running civil wars in the world, now the subject of a fragile ceasefire.

Since 1962, Myanmar’s military regimes have attempted to crush all ethnic demands for autonomy and human rights, fueling decades of civil war.

In a bid to woo Western governments and investors, peace talks were launched by ex-President Thein Sein, a retired military general. However the meandering peace process, which started in 2012, never got far beyond fragile ceasefire agreements.

Ceasefires with Shan and Karen armed forces have been undermined by Burmese army offensives, sometimes linked to the deployment of troops to secure dam-sites.

The KNLA (the Karen rebel army) have confirmed their readiness to stop any attempt at dam construction by China’s Sinohydro and their partner from Thailand, the Egat Thai Electricity Commission.

Zipporah Sein, vice president of the Karen National Union, told The Diplomat: “If they use force to build a dam in our territory, it will create conflict and it will surely disrupt the current peace building process. KNU has a policy that until we reach the political settlement, mega projects like the Hatgyi dam, and all other mega projects will not be permitted.”

The Karen anti-dam movement, backed by the fifth brigade of the KNLA, is trying to convert the conflict over dams into a bold formula for peace and environmental cooperation with the NLD government.

Much may depend on whether the new government will respect the capacity of the Karen people to administer a “Peace Park” protecting rare and endangered wildlife species as part of Karen campaign for autonomy within a federal system.

“If our way of life and environmental knowledge is recognized and supported, we can continue to protect biodiversity here. We are very organized,” said Saw Blaw Htoo, a biodiversity specialist with Kesan who proudly showed his photos of endangered wild cattle and leopards taken by his camera traps in the designated “Peace Park” wildlife sanctuary.

While many in the predominantly Burmese NLD may question the qualifications and expertise of an ethnic group in running an unofficial wildlife park, some international conservationists are impressed with what the Karen people have already achieved.

Jeff Rutherhood, a Thailand-based environmental consultant, commented, “Many national parks run by governments in the region fail to protect wildlife, because locals don’t have a role in protecting wildlife. In Mutraw District of Karen State, a system of community-supported protected areas with patrols by rangers against poaching is already in place.”

Given the proliferation of poachers and illegal wild-life trafficking all over the region, including Myanmar, some international NGOs are positive about the Karen project.

Dr. Christy Williams, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) country manager for Myanmar, told The Diplomat, “We very much welcome the efforts of the Karen Forest Department under KNU to protect the wildlife in areas under their control. It is certainly a positive sign. Species such as tigers are extremely dependent on protection and we are glad to hear about the organized effort to protect them.”

Saw Blaw Htoo, points out the benefits of having local authorities’ full support for the park., “In Thailand, if a ranger wants to stop poachers, who will help them? Here if our rangers are outnumbered by armed poachers, we can have two dozen Karen soldiers there in time to help. Our Karen soldiers believe that wildlife protection is part of their job.”

Environmentalists hope the Salween Peace Park will become part of the peace process. “It would be a big win for conservation” says WWF’s Dr Mitchell, “if wildlife conservation protection is part of the larger peace agreement between the Government of Myanmar and the Karens.”

No dams in China — so what next for Myanmar?

The shift in Chinese policy on the Nu river has become even more firmly against dams with the appointment of new Yunnan Provincial Secretary Li Jiheng, who wants to set up a national park to stimulate the region’s budding eco-tourism industry, according to a report in the National Geographic.

“The Nu River will become a world-level tourism destination in 5 to 10 years,” Li said on China National Radio, according to reports by state media. “It will succeed, even surpass the Grand Canyon in the United States.”

A civil society lobby wants the Myanmar government to match the cessation of dams on the upper Salween in Yunnan province. Paul Sein Twa concluded, “If China does not build dams, Burma also should not build any. They should work together. This river should flow freely starting from the river’s source to its mouth”

China has already decided the risks were too high to go ahead with these dams. If Myanmar follows suit, then the dream of trans-boundary Chinese- Myanmar cooperation could become a win-win reality, which would keep the river undammed and at the same time promote eco-tourism and wildlife conservation.

Wanda dismissed creative accounting allegations

Finding Nemo sequel debut grossed $18.2M, Pixar’s best yet

Last weekend, the weekend of Friday June 10, Legendary’s Warcraft — bolstered by an enormous contingent of Chinese fans of the “World of Warcraft” online video game — scored the country’s biggest five-day opening of all-time with $156 million in ticket sales. Meanwhile, the video game adaptation crashed and burned upon arrival in North America, taking in just $24.2 million from a 3-day debut.

This weekend, starting Friday June 17, Disney/Pixar’s Finding Dory cruised to $136.2 million in North America, the biggest opening ever for an animated film. However, in China, where Pixar has failed to gain a foothold despite other Disney successes, moviegoers once again gave the animation studio a cold reception. The Finding Nemo sequel earned just RMB 118.6 million ($18.2 million).

Still, ‘Dory’’s modest debut is the biggest-ever opening for a Pixar title in China and it should overtake sequel Monsters University ($33.9 million) to become Pixar’s highest-grossing film in the territory.

Warcraft meanwhile earned its second straight weekend victory with RMB 159 million ($24.2 million), and now has grossed RMB 1.3464 billion ($205.0 million) in 12 days of release.

As expected, ticket sales for Warcraft have fallen precipitously after its record debut. This weekend’s gross was a steep 63% below its three-day $65 million total the weekend of June 10, and a killer 85% slide from its five-day opening haul.

Compounding issues for Wanda, the Chinese production/distribution/exhibition behemoth that purchased Legendary in February for $3.5 billion dollars and the company that stands to gain the most from Warcraft’s success, were claims of box office fraud that began surfacing on Chinese social media late Sunday night.

Nationwide box office data showed 82 of the top 100 grossing cinemas on Saturday belonged to Wanda, far above the usual 40 that usually constitute the list.

One theater in the city of Foshan, in southern Guangdong Province, saw ticket sales increase 406% from Friday, and somehow a Wanda cineplex in the city of flood-stricken Liuzhou in Guangxi Province had an average of 130 moviegoers per screening on Saturday; Warcraft’s highest average attendance was 93 during its midnight screenings. Something wasn’t adding up.

Dalian Wanda released a statement on Monday explaining that the increased cinema attendance was tied to a nationwide promotional activity that brought in record numbers of consumers to its shopping malls and that the box office spike wasn’t due to any nefarious accounting manipulation.

Still, the statement did little to quell speculation among industry observers dubious of Wanda’s power in every link of the Chinese film industry supply chain.","Mon, 20 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",http://chinafilminsider.com/apple-touch-icon.png,"['chinese', 'china', 'ticket', 'million', 'warcraft', 'wanda', 'rmb', 'scrutiny', 'office', 'box', 'come', 'sequel', 'opening', 'weekend', 'sales']", 
43,43,FL-2016-000064-CHN,Gravel-bed river floodplains are the ecological nexus of glaciated mountain landscapes - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/6/e1600026,"Gravel-bed river floodplains in mountain landscapes disproportionately concentrate diverse habitats, nutrient cycling, productivity of biota, and species interactions. Although stream ecologists know that river channel and floodplain habitats used by aquatic organisms are maintained by hydrologic regimes that mobilize gravel-bed sediments, terrestrial ecologists have largely been unaware of the importance of floodplain structures and processes to the life requirements of a wide variety of species. We provide insight into gravel-bed rivers as the ecological nexus of glaciated mountain landscapes. We show why gravel-bed river floodplains are the primary arena where interactions take place among aquatic, avian, and terrestrial species from microbes to grizzly bears and provide essential connectivity as corridors for movement for both aquatic and terrestrial species. Paradoxically, gravel-bed river floodplains are also disproportionately unprotected where human developments are concentrated. Structural modifications to floodplains such as roads, railways, and housing and hydrologic-altering hydroelectric or water storage dams have severe impacts to floodplain habitat diversity and productivity, restrict local and regional connectivity, and reduce the resilience of both aquatic and terrestrial species, including adaptation to climate change. To be effective, conservation efforts in glaciated mountain landscapes intended to benefit the widest variety of organisms need a paradigm shift that has gravel-bed rivers and their floodplains as the central focus and that prioritizes the maintenance or restoration of the intact structure and processes of these critically important systems throughout their length and breadth.

Keywords

Here, we synthesize decades of disciplinary research into an interdisciplinary review of the evidence for gravel-bed rivers and their floodplains as essential focal points of biodiversity and productivity and as corridors for connectivity across the glaciated mountain landscapes of the northern Rocky Mountains. We examine the role of natural processes in maintaining diverse, viable, and interconnected populations of native species that are challenged to adapt to climate change and other human stressors. We review the underlying research in hydrology and geomorphology that sets the stage for ecological interactions on gravel-bed floodplains, where aquatic and terrestrial habitats are intimately intertwined. We explain why we believe that gravel-bed rivers and their floodplains are the ecological focal point of habitat complexity and biodiversity in glaciated mountain landscapes and the “arena” for ecological interactions between and among species. We conclude with the argument that research and management of river ecosystems have too often been approached from a narrow perspective of the river as just a channel plus a narrow riparian ecotone adjacent to it. We argue that river conservation and restoration efforts that consider only the river channel while largely ignoring an expansive floodplain will not be effective at achieving local- or regional-scale benefits. Similarly, efforts to protect upland systems and wildlife that do not address fracturing and connectivity of the river system to uplands will also be compromised. In glaciated mountain systems, conservation efforts intended to benefit a wide spectrum of plants and animals across the landscape must prioritize intact structures and processes throughout the length of gravel-bed rivers and the width of their floodplains.

This review provides insights into the ecological importance of gravel-bed river floodplains in glaciated mountain landscapes and is unique in the breadth of its focus. This effort considers the full continuum of species and processes that gravel-bed rivers support, from microbes and meiofauna within the subsurface of the gravel-bed river floodplain up to vertebrate taxa, including amphibians, fishes, birds, mammals, ungulates, and large carnivores. We make the case that the ecological importance of gravel-bed river floodplains as regulators of mountain landscapes has been overlooked because of the strong disciplinary approaches taken with classic fields in hydrology, geomorphology, ecology, and conservation biology. Simply put, syntheses between hydrologists, avian ecologists, freshwater biologists, and large-mammal ecologists have been rare on this subject.

Rivers and their riparian corridors are known to play an important role in regional biodiversity ( 1 ), but the mechanisms sustaining ecological integrity are less well understood across disciplines. Gravel-bed rivers, which commonly occur in the valley bottoms of heavily glaciated mountain systems ( Fig. 1 ), such as those found in the Rocky Mountains of North America, the Alps of Europe, the Andes of Patagonia, the Southern Alps of New Zealand, and the high Himalayas of Asia, are particularly characterized by dynamic fluvial processes that constantly change and renew the surface and subsurface of the river’s valley floor ( 2 , 3 ). In the glaciated regions of the Rocky Mountains, essentially from the Yellowstone area in northwestern Wyoming, United States, to Yukon, Canada, gravel-bed rivers are disproportionately important to regional biodiversity and to landscape-scale ecological integrity. Research conducted in this mountain region, across a wide variety of fields in ecology and diverse taxa, has highlighted the importance of these gravel-bed rivers to an unexpectedly high proportion of the region’s aquatic, avian, and terrestrial species. Although gravel-bed river floodplains play a disproportionately important role in sustaining native plant and animal biodiversity, they have also been disproportionately affected by human infrastructure and activities ( 4 ). In northern Rocky Mountain landscapes, dams, diversions, agriculture, flood control, exurban development, and transportation corridors are but a few of the vast array of human-mediated direct and indirect factors that affect river processes. First principles of ecosystem management ( 5 ) focus on the protection and conservation of the most diverse and the most productive places to maintain viable populations of native species and ecosystem types. Maintaining evolutionary and ecological processes ( 6 ), including disturbance regimes ( 7 ), hydrologic processes ( 2 ), nutrient cycles ( 8 ), and connectivity across spatial and temporal scales ( 9 ), is central to sound conservation. Because gravel-bed rivers and especially floodplains are focal points for biodiversity in maintaining viable aquatic, avian, and terrestrial populations, we need to focus on their conservation, with particular attention to the processes that maintain them in space (across the valley floor) and time (over decades and centuries).

THE GRAVEL-BED RIVER AND FLOODPLAIN ECOSYSTEM

Hydrogeomorphic complexity and connectivity Broad U-shaped river valleys are characteristic of glaciated mountain landscapes where large alpine valleys have been deepened and enlarged in response to Pleistocene glaciation (10). Three linked hydrogeomorphic domains are found in these U-shaped valleys: canyons, lakes, and gravel-bed floodplains. The distribution of these domains depends on the underlying bedrock, the width of the valley, and the history of glacial advances and gravel deposition. Where a valley is narrow and bedrock is near or at the surface, the river will cut a canyon and flow as a single channel down a steep gradient. Where the valley is broad, the valley floor may be either filled with water, creating a lake, or filled with glacial and alluvial sediments, creating a gravel-bed floodplain. Often, these hydrogeomorphic domains will alternate and reappear several times as a river makes its way down the valley (11). Rivers in canyons support comparatively less biodiversity than floodplain segments because the narrow, linear river corridor of confined river segments has much less physical complexity and habitat diversity. By contrast, the gravel-bed floodplains on the same river system are extremely complex, creating an extraordinary diversity of habitats that support diverse communities of aquatic, avian, and terrestrial species (12, 13). In the Yellowstone to Yukon (Y2Y) region glaciers, snowfields and rainfall feed into the valley’s surface water and groundwater. Flow volume in the river channel varies markedly by season, with the spring flood period providing most of the annual stream flow and with lower volumes in late summer, fall, and winter, barring unusual weather events. During the annual spring snowmelt, high volumes of water have enough energy to mobilize gravel and cobble bed sediments, scour river channels, and cut banks on the outer edge of river bends while depositing sediments to create gravel bars on the inside edge. This process, called cut-and-fill alluviation, is dynamic and, over many years, produces a legacy of sorted and unsorted cobbles and gravels distributed across the surface and subsurface of the entire floodplain. Thus, the channel changes both its shape and location repeatedly over time (14). Occasionally, during flood disturbance events, the river will completely change its channel as waters flow across the floodplain surface, cut a new channel, and leave behind an abandoned channel. These multiscale disturbance processes create a mosaic of cobble, gravel, and finer deposits across both the surface and the subsurface of the floodplain (3). For example, large cobbles with few interstitial fines are created by sediment mobilization during flood events and then get buried as the channel migrates, creating subsurface, heterogeneous flow networks (15). Across the surface of the floodplain, the mosaic of habitats is expressed in different successional stages, including new channels, very old channels, ponds, barren gravel bars, young vegetation stands, and gallery old-growth forests that are hundreds of years old (Fig. 2). The complex mosaic of surface and subsurface habitats is interconnected longitudinally with the river slope, laterally from the river channel across the floodplain, and vertically from the river channel into the subsurface gravels (16). Fig. 2 The three-dimensional structure of the gravel-bed river. Illustration shows the longitudinal, lateral, and vertical dynamics of the floodplain system. The floodplain landscape is created and maintained by biophysical processes that lead to a complex and dynamic habitat mosaic at the surface and in the subsurface. In this cutaway view, the hyporheic alluvial aquifer, characterized by river-origin water flowing through the gravel subsurface, is shown from valley wall to valley wall. The larger blue arrows signify the hyporheic waters that develop at the upper end of the floodplain and flow through the gravel substratum to discharge into the surface at the lower end of the floodplain following long flow pathways. The smaller arrows near the surface illustrate the water exchange between the surface waters and the upper hyporheic waters in the shallow bed sediments that occurs repeatedly along the length of the floodplain. The smaller U-shaped arrows at the interface between the hyporheic zone and phreatic groundwaters illustrate the small exchange that occurs between the hyporheic zone and deeper, phreatic groundwaters that are stored for longer periods of time. The black crescents represent the legacy of cut-and-fill alluviation, characterized by highly sorted open-network cobble substrata with interstitial flow pathways left behind as the river channel moves laterally on the floodplain surface (E. Harrington, eh illustration, Missoula, MT). Throughout the year, water is constantly flowing out of the river channel and into the gravels below and laterally beyond the channel (that is, “hyporheic zone,” from the Greek hypo, meaning “under,” and rheic, meaning “river”). This river-origin water extends across the U-shaped valley bottom, often from valley wall to valley wall and often hundreds of meters to more than a kilometer laterally from the river channel (17). The water that flows in and out of the channel, both vertically and laterally, reappears as upwelling springs directly in the river or in other lateral features such as side channels, springbrooks, and pond habitats on the surface of the floodplain. Water can travel hundreds of meters per day through the floodplain gravels. River water that flows in and out of the channel and the subsurface alluvium creates an extraordinary diversity of ecological niches within the gravel-bed river floodplain. During summer, surface waters heated by solar radiation are cooled by hyporheic groundwater discharge to the surface, creating spatial heterogeneity of water temperatures across the floodplain. The wide variety of temperature regimes is a function of solar warming in the main channel and shallow shorelines and the cool groundwater upwelling into those same habitats (Fig. 3A) (18). During winter, those locations that are summer-cooled become winter-warmed, which prevents the river water in that reach from becoming frozen as anchor or surface ice (19).

Nutrients, microbes, and aquatic insects in the gravel It is broadly understood that river channels support aquatic life and the cycling of nutrients. However, outside of the discipline of stream ecology, it is not as widely appreciated that nutrient-rich waters below and lateral to the channel support a complex food web composed of microbes, mesofaunal crustaceans, and aquatic insects that are hydrologically connected to the river and dependent on the surface water and groundwater exchange. Simply put, most terrestrial ecologists assume that the river and aquatic interface is confined to the river channel. However, the expansive nature of the river corridor in floodplain reaches leads to the aquatic habitat diversity of these unconfined reaches being much higher than that of confined river reaches, subsequently leading to a significantly higher diversity in the aquatic food web (17, 20). Downwelling water from the river channel into the gravel-bed subsurface carries both particulate and dissolved organic matter (20). Oxygen concentrations in the river water are near saturation as the water enters the gravel. At the point of entering the subsurface, particulate organic matter is trapped and filtered from the water. This concentration of particulate organic matter at the oxygen-rich points of downwelling supports abundant and productive communities of microbes and particulate-feeding aquatic insects (20). The dissolved organic matter continues to travel into the gravel with the subsurface water. As this water moves through the subsurface gravels, the oxygen becomes depleted by microbial decomposers, which release both CO 2 and biologically available forms of nitrogen and phosphorus (21). These bioavailable nutrients flow through the subsurface gravels to reemerge at the surface in springbrooks, ponds, and backwaters, or they may upwell directly into the river channel. Bursts of algal growth occur where these nutrients, which are carried by upwelling of the hyporheic groundwater, come to the surface (Fig. 3B) (22). Grazing aquatic insects achieve high densities and growth rates at these sites of high algal growth (19). Many small crustaceans and large aquatic insects spend early stages of their life histories in these nutrient-rich subsurface gravels throughout the gravel-bed river floodplain, again hundreds of meters lateral to the river channel (17), reflecting the expansive nature of the alluvial, hyporheic aquifer. They are nourished not only by the dissolved organic matter carried into the gravels by downwelling river water but also by the decomposition of organic matter (such as coarse woody material) that has been buried in the gravels by cut-and-fill alluviation. This buried organic matter forms concentrated sites of decomposition and microbial activity, including anaerobic methanogenic bacteria that account for as much as 99% of energy flow in some species of the hyporheic food web (Fig. 3C) (23). The aquatic insects that live in the gravel can be found from valley wall to valley wall and from the top to the bottom of the floodplain in the spaces between the cobbles created by periodic rolling of the rocks through hydrogeomorphic processes. These aquatic insects return to the river channel through the interstices in the gravels and then emerge and reproduce. Hyporheic invertebrates can form a significant portion of the total production of invertebrates of the river (17) and, thus, directly affect higher levels of the river food web, including fishes, amphibians, birds, and bats and other mammals (9).

Native fishes and floodplain fluvial processes Many of the habitats that are essential for growth, survival, and persistence of native fishes in the Y2Y region are found exclusively on gravel-bed river floodplains. This is particularly true for native and threatened or endangered salmonids, such as the bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) and the westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi) that occupy gravel-bed river floodplains for their entire lives or travel hundreds of kilometers to seek out these areas to complete their life cycle (24). Trout and other native fishes are dependent on cool water in the summer and unfrozen conditions in the winter, keying into a fundamental character of the groundwater and surface water interaction with the hyporheic zone, as discussed above. Moreover, salmonid reproduction is heavily concentrated in habitats directly associated with groundwater upwelling from the subsurface into the gravels of the river channel (19, 25). In such upwelling sites, incubation temperature is ideal, and there is well-oxygenated water and a sufficient flow to carry away nitrogen waste products from the incubating embryos. Adult female trout construct their redds (that is, nests for incubating eggs) in gravels that have been rolled and swept clean of fine sediments, first by fluvial processes during the spring snowmelt flood and then, again, by the spawning fish. Thus, a suitable spawning habitat is dependent not only on cool water per se but also on the hydrologic process of flooding and the groundwater–to–surface water exchange that is maintained by the shifting habitat dynamics of the gravel-bed river floodplains on the alluvial valley floor (Fig. 3D) (25). The habitats created by fluvial processes on and in the gravel-bed river floodplains are essential not only for spawning but also to the rest of the life cycle of native salmonids. Juvenile salmonids typically use side channels, springbrooks, and low-velocity shoreline habitats for early rearing and feeding (26), whereas subadult and adult fishes require deep, complex areas of the channel with channel-edge vegetative cover for feeding and protection from predation (27). Trees that fall in the river channel through the process of cut-and-fill alluviation create pools and structures and provide shade that is important during the summer months (28). Groundwater upwelling from the floodplain gravels creates an ideal overwintering habitat because of the relatively warm, ice-free conditions provided by hyporheic return flows to the river (19). Alluvial valley segments support relatively higher levels of genetic diversity and abundances of native salmonids (29), underscoring the importance of these habitats as “biological hot spots” for evolutionary potential (that is, adaptive capacity), resiliency to environmental change, and overall persistence.

Amphibians in ephemeral floodplain habitats Amphibian reproduction requires pond and nearshore channel environments with specific thermal and hydroperiod conditions (that is, the length of time that surface water is present). Often overlooked is the fact that, in glaciated mountain environments, the greatest diversity of thermal and hydroperiod conditions is found among the ponds and disconnected backwaters of gravel-bed river floodplains. Many amphibians select ephemeral ponds for breeding to avoid predation. The short hydroperiod of such ephemeral ponds prevents predatory fish from accessing the same habitat that amphibians select for eggs and immature aquatic stages. However, to exploit these ephemeral habitats, larval amphibians must grow and develop rapidly before the water disappears. Pond habitats on the open floodplain that are created by the spring flood receive direct sunlight and can be warmed to >25°C, yet have bottom temperatures of <7°C because of subsurface groundwater entering the bottom of the pond through the gravels. Ponds in paleochannels that thread through an adjacent forest tend to be much cooler from top to bottom because of shading by the surrounding mature vegetation and the upwelling of groundwater. This array of thermal and hydroperiod conditions supports not only a diverse amphibian assemblage (30) but also high levels of intraspecific genetic diversity and plasticity in phenotypic expression (31).

Disturbance and vegetation diversity across the floodplain The ecological importance of vegetation to aquatic ecosystems has been widely studied (32, 33). However, riparian vegetation is often considered as a relatively narrow band (that is, 25 to 50 m in width) next to the channel, whereas the relevance of plant communities that extend across the floodplain is ignored in the context of “vegetation in the riparian zone.” This understanding is inaccurate and is now realized to be too limited. On the gravel-bed river floodplains of the Y2Y region, riparian plant communities extend hundreds of meters to kilometers from the active channel to the lateral edges of the floodplain (see Fig. 1). Water from the river channel downwelling into the hyporheic zone of the floodplain and then flowing subsurface from lateral edge to lateral edge of the floodplain nourishes the trees and other plants (34). The combination of these nutrient pulses with multiscale disturbance of cut-and-fill alluviation, larger-scale flood disturbance history, and fire disturbance creates a highly productive and biodiverse vegetation community. Native cottonwoods (Populus spp.) and willows (Salix spp.) dominate early succession of gravel-bed river floodplains in the Y2Y region, and their life history traits are tightly linked with the natural flow regime (35). Cottonwoods and willows are intolerant of established vegetation, and seedling recruitment requires barren sites newly formed by flood disturbance events and scour, as described above. Although these species are prolific seed producers, the tiny seeds are annually released in a short interval after the spring snowmelt peak and are only viable for a few weeks. The seeds are blown or floated onto moist and barren sites left behind on the exposed cobble bars by the receding river water. After germination, the small seedlings will only survive through the first summer of highly xeric conditions on the bare cobble and gravel bars if the river stage recedes slowly enough for the root elongation to track the falling groundwater zone, which is tightly linked to the river level. If the rate of decline following the peak in the flood hydrograph is too rapid, then seedlings desiccate and die with resulting poor recruitment (36). Conifer-dominated stands often eventually replace cottonwood stands in areas of the floodplain that are undisturbed for a long period of time (14), and with their lower productivity, conifers also tend to harbor lower biodiversity (37). Thus, highly stable floodplains (that is, lacking disturbance flooding) in the Y2Y region become dominated by less diverse and less productive conifers. Gravel-bed river floodplains contain a complex set of habitats that includes soil moisture ranging from extremely xeric to mesic and hosts an extraordinarily high diversity of plant species. More than 60% of plant species from the floodplain valley floor to the alpine occur on the heterogeneous habitats of the gravel-bed floodplains (38). This is because moisture gradients that occur across hundreds of meters of elevation on mountainsides are highly compressed over short elevation differences on floodplains but support similarly diverse species assemblages. These rich and diverse floodplain plant communities are shaped by, and in many cases are dependent on, the natural dynamic processes of the river. Many of the plants of gravel-bed river floodplains are pioneering species that not only are tolerant of flooding but also are actually dependent on the physical disturbance of the cut-and-fill alluviation process that creates open cobble bars for their reproduction (39). These plant communities also influence the river’s hydrological and geomorphic processes as large trees of old-growth forest patches are eroded, and large wood debris is captured by the river during flood events. The largest wood creates hydraulic complexity with deep scour in one location and high deposition in another (3, 28). Likewise, paleochannels with scour holes become pond habitats with hydric soils and wetland plants. These often occur directly next to floodplain surfaces 2 to 3 m in elevation above the groundwater table, which is directly controlled by the river stage. Thus, old-growth cottonwoods and spruce forests are often seen growing directly adjacent to both the contemporary channel and old paleochannels (14).

Avian direct and indirect use of floodplains Many bird species are known to rely on river corridor habitats. In the Y2Y region, more than 70% of the species diversity is associated with gravel-bed rivers and floodplains to complete part of their life cycle (if not the entire cycle) (40). The continuum of floodplain use among bird species in the region ranges from those entirely reliant on near-channel habitats (for example, water and shore birds), to birds that seasonally occupy adjacent riparian forest habitats for breeding activity (for example, flycatchers, wet woodland passerines, and raptors), to short-term inhabitants of the river floodplain during migrations or seasonal temporary users before local connectivity to uplands (for example, neotropical migrants). The highest bird densities (41) and greatest bird diversity (42) are associated with expansive floodplains containing a variety of aquatic and terrestrial habitats with large and complex patches of deciduous gallery forests intersected by side channels and a range of successional plant communities. The dependence of passerines on riparian vegetation, especially in the semi-arid west, has led ornithologists to refer to gravel-bed river systems as the “aorta” of mountain landscapes (43). The diverse structure and composition of floodplain vegetation that result from fluvial processes lead directly to high bird diversity (42). The cottonwood gallery forests, which are highly dependent on fluvial processes, provide nesting and perching sites. Freshly exposed gravels are a critical habitat to spotted sandpipers (Actitis macularius) and other shorebirds. Gravel-bed floodplains are also important to birds typically thought of as upland breeding species. Following their spring migration to the Y2Y region, many upland species rely on the gravel-bed river floodplain habitats along the valley floor early in the season before breeding or as they prepare to migrate south in the fall. For instance, ruby-crowned kinglets (Regulus calendula), categorized as “coniferous forest specialists,” inhabit gravel-bed floodplains during the winter and early spring. Some stay in the coniferous forest adjacent to the floodplain, whereas others move to an upland forest habitat as resources become available for breeding activity later in the spring (44). Migrating insectivorous birds prefer floodplains because of the predictable and abundant food resources and a lower predation risk than other environments (45). Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) that breed in coniferous forests often forage over floodplains (46), and although falcons do not rely solely on gravel-bed floodplains, these areas provide critical prey resources (for example, waterfowl, passerines, and shorebirds) that attract and support peregrine populations and those of other raptors.

The arena for ungulate and wolf interactions Many large mammals, such as moose (Alces alces), beaver (Castor canadensis), and river otter (Lutra canadensis), are obligate users of wetlands, rivers, and floodplain habitats. However, the wide variety of large mammals generally considered as upland species but which rely heavily on gravel-bed river floodplains for many portions of their life histories is often overlooked. Throughout the Y2Y region, large-mammal communities are shaped by elevation, climate, precipitation, and primary productivity gradients created by the mountain ecosystem (47). Gravel-bed river floodplains in the region provide the overall highest annual primary productivity (48), the earliest appearance of spring-emergent vegetation, and the latest continuance of fresh vegetation in the fall (49). Critical grasslands and shrub and aspen stands required for winter maintenance of large ungulates, such as bison (Bison bison), elk (Cervus elaphus), and deer (Odocoileus spp.), dominate the vegetation of alluvial fans, which extend onto broader gravel-bed river floodplains at the lower elevation valley bottoms. Gravel-bed river floodplains provide boreal lichens for woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and a key habitat for large carnivores such as wolves (Canis lupus), grizzly bears (Ursus arctos), and mountain lions (Felis concolor) (50, 51). Gravel-bed floodplains provide not only critical habitats but also the arena for key ecological interactions among several large mammals (Fig. 4A). Carnivory and herbivory are important ecological processes that affect both gravel-bed river floodplains and upland habitats in mountainous ecosystems (52). In the Y2Y region, wolves commonly den along the edge or directly on large gravel-bed river floodplains (53). Wolves find preferred materials for denning in gravel and sand deposits along banks exposed by the processes of cut-and-fill alluviation. Gravel-bed floodplains also provide a significant predation advantage to wolves. Spring migratory corridors of their prey, from winter ranges to alpine summer ranges, follow valley bottoms, passing close to active wolf dens (54) and increasing the likelihood of successful predation during spring and fall (55). In summer, risk of mortality is greatest when ungulates cross lower-elevation valleys between alpine ranges (55), whereas during winter, an estimated 40% of all wolf kills within Banff National Park occurred on gravel-bed river floodplains. Moreover, the attraction of ungulates to spring green-up near warmer groundwater upwelling zones may create an ungulate “hot spot” during the time of year when large ungulates are in poor body condition (56). These hot spots are then exploited by large carnivores, resulting in the important late winter–early spring spike in mortality of all ungulate species on the gravel-bed floodplains (57). Many studies show that ungulates pursued by predators on uplands will descend onto the floodplain of the valley bottom, attempting to use the river as an escape strategy. When this strategy proves unsuccessful, the kill invariably occurs on the floodplain. Thus, in the case of wolves and coyotes, it is particularly disadvantageous for prey to escape by running downhill (58).

(B) A map of grizzly bear subpopulations in the United States–Canada transboundary area of the Y2Y region derived from fragmentation synthesis. Numerical values represent subpopulation estimates. The yellow dotted lines delineate fragmentation between subpopulations and follow fragmented gravel-bed river floodplains [modified with permission from the study by Proctor et al. (65)]. The predation that occurs on gravel-bed floodplains also affects the health and reproduction of cottonwoods on the floodplain and upland aspen forests. Wolf predation on elk, which occurs primarily on gravel bars, is capable of providing top-down controls on elk density in some systems (52). Eradication of wolves and other carnivores across the southern half of the region in the 1930s to 1960s led to the extreme overpopulation of large ungulates, in particular elk, throughout many river valleys (59). The increased elk numbers, in turn, led to a marked increase in herbivory by elk on woody browse species such as aspen, cottonwoods, and willow, which then cascaded to declines in beaver and other obligates of early willow and mature forest species, such as riparian passerine birds (52). The loss of the deciduous cottonwood and aspen forests not only had a direct effect on beaver populations but also had a significant effect on the role large wood has in hydrogeomorphic processes of the gravel-bed river floodplains. In the last several decades, the restoration of wolves in Banff and Yellowstone has reversed the loss of woody browse species on gravel-bed river floodplains (60). Results from spatial risk models for Yellowstone National Park and the Ya Ha Tinda and Bow Valley in Banff National Park show that since the 1990s, wolf predation on elk has also resulted in a marked rejuvenation of upland aspen (52, 61). Predation on ungulates on gravel-bed floodplains also likely results in an overlooked but important source of nutrient flow. The role of salmon as a nutrient subsidy from the marine environment to gravel-bed floodplains around the north Pacific Rim has been well documented (62). Similarly, a study on Isle Royale (63) showed that the distribution of wolf-killed moose carcasses had strong and persistent effects on terrestrial nutrient cycling by concentrating nutrients at the site of the kill. Work in Yellowstone National Park has shown high pulses of nutrients from carcasses to terrestrial systems. Because predation risk is highest on gravel-bed floodplains, high nutrient concentrations around large ungulate carcasses are likely to reach the aquatic system (63).

Floodplains as “connectors and fragmentors” of grizzly bear populations There was once a large contiguous population of grizzly bears (U. arctos) across western North America from Mexico to Alaska. Today, south of Alaska and central and northwestern Canada, the southern part of the Y2Y region holds the remnant distribution in what was the southern half of their North American distribution (64). In this area, there is a contracted suite of subpopulations, some of which are small with high conservation risk, whereas others are healthier and act as core anchors to the whole system (65). Direct mortality and habitat loss were the initial causes of severe range contraction, but such mortality and habitat loss have been significantly reduced in many areas. Now, population fragmentation is a major threat to the remaining grizzly bears (65). Grizzly bears have ecological characteristics that make them particularly vulnerable to human activities. They occur in sparse densities and have low reproductive rates and male-biased dispersal. In the southern Y2Y region, population fragmentation for grizzly bears is concentrated on gravel-bed river floodplains. Floodplains are critical to grizzly bears for two reasons. The well-known reason is that floodplains are the first areas to green up in the spring and, thus, are disproportionately used when bears emerge from hibernation. The insight that they are critical for reasons of fragmentation is novel. Previously, fragmentation has been a more generalized concern about human transportation and settlement corridors (65), but now, we observe that the gravel-bed floodplain portions of these areas are a seasonally critical habitat and paradoxically serve as a source of fragmentation. For grizzly bear populations in southern Canada and the northern United States, the human settlement and transportation corridors within gravel-bed river floodplains and river valleys in general actually define the boundaries of grizzly bear subpopulations (Fig. 4B) (65). The opposite of fragmentation is movement enabled by connectivity. It is important for all wide-ranging species but is especially important for grizzly bears. For grizzly bear populations, female movement is critical. Females provide population viability, and in-migration of females is required to rescue small, fragmented populations from extirpation (65). In the Y2Y region, movement of females between mountain ranges is both concentrated (66) and most at risk across gravel-bed river floodplains. Female connectivity is not a dash across a human settled valley but a process where female offspring disperse away from their mother into their adult home range that usually overlaps a portion of their maternal range (67). Because female grizzly bear dispersal is gradual (67) and over relatively short distances (68), linkage areas are not narrow movement corridors but need to be large secure areas (that is, kilometers long and across whole gravel-bed river floodplains) where female bears can live portions of their lives with minimal mortality risk. Where gravel-bed river floodplains are intact in remote places such as the Flathead Valley in southern Canada and the western boundary of Glacier National Park (United States), there is no population fragmentation (68). By contrast, in the adjacent but more heavily used Elk River Valley along Highway 3, north of the Flathead watershed, human developments on gravel-bed floodplains have inhibited female movements, although males still cross the valley (68). Farther west, human developments in the Nelson, British Columbia, area have completely blocked valley bottom movements of both males and females, leading to genetic differentiation and isolation of the southern Selkirk Mountain population (Fig. 4B) (65). These patterns hold across the southern Y2Y region. Both males and females demonstrated reduced movement rates with increasing settlement and traffic. Female movement rates reduced markedly when settlement increased to >20% of a fracture zone. Male movement continues past the 20% level but declines gradually. In highly settled areas (>50%), both sexes had a similar reduction in movements in response to traffic, settlement, and mortality. The result is that several small bear populations that have male-only immigration are not viable over the long term (65). In the Y2Y region, floodplains are often in private hands. The paradigm where human settlement patterns usurp entire river valleys could be improved to better serve biodiversity objectives that include large carnivores if portions of these valley systems contain low human densities and are managed for or restored to a condition closer to their natural state (65, 68). Thus, conservation efforts that focus on securing gravel-bed river valley bottom habitat on private land are essential in maintaining healthy connected grizzly bear populations across the Y2Y region (65, 68). Further, for public lands such as the Canadian Flathead where valley bottoms have both an intact gravel-bed river floodplain structure and hydrological processes, conservation management that minimizes human densities, and thus mortality risk and habitat disturbance, is critical for the regional grizzly bear metapopulation to persist.","Fri, 24 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/6/e1600026/F1.large.jpg,"['water', 'valley', 'landscapes', 'floodplains', 'ecological', 'glaciated', 'species', 'river', 'gravelbed', 'floodplain', 'processes', 'channel', 'habitats', 'mountain', 'nexus']",

Gov’t not to blame for capital floods, PM says

Prime Minister Hun Sen yesterday blasted online critics who had been taking the government to task over the flash flood that enveloped parts of the capital on June 8.

During a speech to students, the premier told critics not to blame the government for poor drainage, insisting that the rain on June 8 was unusually strong, and that floods happen in many cities around the world.

“One person posted in French about flooding in Phnom Penh, but didn’t post about flooding in Paris,” said Hun Sen, referring to a June 3 inundation of the French capital.

“The flood is from the water that could not flow into the drains in time,” he added.

NGOs STT and People in Need reported last month that flooding, which can occur near-daily during the rainy season, is a top concern of capital residents.

Both NGOs, along with good governance group ANSA-EAP, said that filling in natural lakes for development projects – including Boeung Kak lake, which was filled in by ruling party Senator Lao Meng Khin – removed natural drains, exacerbating floods during heavy rain.

The Japan International Cooperation Agency, which is funding a pumping station for drainage at Boeung Trabek, did not respond to questions about the cause of flooding in the city yesterday.

According to JICA materials, people in the Trabek basin currently face risk of floods of up to a metre high that can last up to seven hours. The Boeung Trabek station was 70 per cent complete as of May 24, according to City Hall.","Tue, 14 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.phnompenhpost.com/sites/default/files/field/image/a_man_drives_his_motorcycle_along_a_flooded_road_in_central_phnom_penh_last_week_after_heavy_rains_hit_the_capital_08_06_2016_pha_lina.jpg,"['govt', 'floods', 'natural', 'trabek', 'sen', 'capital', 'blame', 'penh', 'flooding', 'station', 'phnom', 'boeung']", 
45,45,FL-2016-000064-CHN,Georgia: A Happy Hippo and a Rebuilt Zoo for Flood Anniversary - EurasiaNet,https://eurasianet.org/georgia-happy-hippo-and-rebuilt-zoo-flood-anniversary,"One year after a devastating flood that killed 21 people and sent zoo animals into the streets of Georgia’s capital, Tbilisi, both the city’s zoo and its famous wandering hippopotamus, Begi, are back in shape.



On June 13, 2015, flood waters lifted Begi and other animals out of their downtown enclosures, creating an apocalyptic tableau of a city of 1.1 million people overrun by water and beasts. Some 230 animals drowned or were shot by police to prevent attacks on humans. Still, one man was mauled to death by an escaped tiger three days after the disaster.



It was on that tragic night that Begi (“hippo”) offered comic relief as he sauntered around a central highway that cuts through the heart of Tbilisi. Next morning, he was sighted passing stately by a downtown Swatch store, pausing to munch phlegmatically on tree leaves. A tranquilizer and some impromptu volunteers, herding him like a cow, eventually returned Begi to the zoo.



“He had a bit of a neurosis going on for some time, was moody, declined food and would not go for a swim,” recounted 57-year-old Tbilisi Zoo Director Zurab Gurielidze, recalling the period after Begi’s brief escape to the urban jungle. But after some medication and lots of care, “Begi is quite happy now.”



“Water is his element, so he did not suffer from the flood that much,” Gurielidze added.



Neither did the crocodile, which also briefly escaped to go preying on fellow zoo animals.



Begi became an instant online sensation in Georgia, with social media displaying Photoshopped images of him sporting sunglasses and walking away from an explosion (#Thug Life). Reuters and TIME Magazine went on to rate the downtown hippo images as among the best photos of 2015.



Today, Begi displays dignified indifference to the attention, patiently allowing himself to be photographed for a magazine. At the age of 17, he is a teenage star and a socially responsible one, too, lending his image to flood-recovery fundraisers.



“We needed an image that is positive and optimistic, and inspired action. The hippo had it all,” said Bidzina Kumsiashvili, co-founder of the Tbilisi Hippo Fund, which helps flood victims and trains volunteers in disaster relief. Since the flood, the Fund has raised about 80,000 laris ($37,559), in part through the sale of t-shirts with Begi’s print on them. “We got 10,000 sold in a single day,” Kumsiashvili added.



But the zoo’s management complains that flood-relief fundraising overlooked their needs. “Lots of groups capitalized on the image of our hippo to raise money, but we did not get a penny out of it,” Gurielidze claimed.



Hundreds of Tbilisi residents volunteered to help clean debris out of the zoo, but, ultimately, Gurielidze said, rebuilding the state-financed zoo was a DIY effort. “We used whatever money, skill and materials we could scrape together to restore the cages,” Gurielidze said.



The Tbilisi Hippo Fund says it chose to focus on helping human victims, filling the gaps left by the city government, which took its time to come up a with an all-encompassing assistance plan. An attempt at cooperation between the Fund and the zoo fell through.



Gurielidze agrees, though, that helping the estimated 1,041 people who, according to the mayor’s office, lost their homes, loved ones or livelihoods (as taxi drivers when they lost their cars) was the right priority for the relief aid. The World Bank estimated the overall damage at about $119 million, according to a document the city government previously shared with EurasiaNet.org.



The national and city governments provided just over 35 million laris (over $16.5 million) and 9.9 million laris ($4.6 million), respectively. Another 26.3 million laris ($12.2 million) came from corporate, individual, international development agency, non-profit and government agency contributions, the Mayor’s Office said. Almost $5 million, the largest private donation, came from the Cartu Group, a business holding founded by Bidzina Ivanishvili, the influential ex-prime minister who has a storied private zoo of his own.



Exactly how much the government gave to the zoo is unclear, however. The Mayor’s Office states that 40 million lari (about $18.78 million) went to infrastructure, which includes zoo renovations and construction of a new zoo. Another 30 million ($14.08 million) went to families whose houses were destroyed by the flood.



The municipality did pay for cleaning and repaving the zoo’s walkways, and for restoring Begi’s quarters, but the bulk of its assistance went toward paying half of the cost for a 1.5-million-lari (over $700,000) wall around a planned new zoo. Spread over 48 hectares (118 acres) in the city’s outskirts, the new zoo is five times the size of the old one, and is perched on high grounds overlooking a reservoir.



The new park will be years in the making, however. Meanwhile, the old zoo remains plunked precariously in the gully of the Vera Creek, a normally timid flow responsible for last year’s deluge. Torrential rain and a massive mudslide caused the creek to overflow, destroying 76 homes and sweeping cars off a neighboring freeway.



On the eve of the disaster’s anniversary, heavy rains returned to Tbilisi for a week, spreading a sense of anxiety. Except for the excitable lemurs, most of the zoo’s tenants, including Begi, retreated under cover. With memories of the 2015 flood still fresh, traffic was thin on the nearby freeway even at rush hour.



To mark the anniversary, the zoo on June 13 offered free entrance, charity auctions, an exhibit of children's paintings, and a display of photos from the flood.



Precautions for a repeat of the disaster have been taken. Most cages are now located on higher ground and a flood-warning system has been installed. Foreign zoos also have helped replenish the Tbilisi zoo’s wildlife, which is now back to its pre-flood number of 600.



“We are getting lots of offers from zoos around the world, but given our restraints, we are taking only those animals that can do fine in our climate,” Gurielidze said.

47,47,FL-2016-000064-CHN,Flood Of Weapons Makes Eastern Ukraine Ripe For Arms Trade - RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty,https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-flood-of-arms-east-conflict-smuggling/27797454.html,"Awash with arms and facing a breakdown in law and order, war-torn eastern Ukraine has all the elements required to become a major illicit international weapons market.

Long a nexus in the global arms trade, Ukraine is already witnessing a boom in black-market sales of arms seeping out of the conflict zone, fueling what authorities say is a wave of violent crime in the country.

""Everyone knows about the weapons market in eastern Ukraine, it's no secret,"" Myroslav Hay, a former Ukrainian volunteer who fought in the east. Speaking to RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service recently, he described an enormous illegal-arms trade, with weapons and ammunition changing hands in some cases for merely a few bottles of alcohol.

For now, most of the illicit weapons trade appears to be isolated inside Ukraine, but there are worrying signs that could soon change.

Trade-Expansion Fears

Fears that at least some of those arms could end up in Western Europe, already on edge since attacks by Islamist extremists in 2015 in Belgium and France, were heightened after the Ukrainian Security Service announced earlier this month that it had nabbed a suspected French extremist with a cache of weapons who was allegedly bent on unleashing mayhem back home.

The man, identified as 25-year-old Gregoire Moutaux, was stopped on the Polish-Ukrainian border on May 21 with 125 kilograms of explosives, five AK-series assault rifles, two antitank grenade launchers, some 5,000 rounds of ammunition, and 100 detonators. Ukrainian officials claimed he was a hard-core nationalist who had planned more than a dozen attacks.

According to French media reports on June 6, Moutaux has no previous criminal record and had entered Ukraine as a ""volunteer,"" using this guise to make contact with military units in eastern Ukraine.

Experts are concerned that the market for illicit arms in Europe could be flooded with weapons from Ukraine, much like 6 million guns from the Balkan wars of the 1990s that are still believed to be circulating in Europe. They see a major difference in the number and firepower of weapons, however.

""There is a threat of more substantial weapons coming out of Ukraine,"" explains Nic R. Jenzen-Jones, a weapons expert and director of Armament Research Services (ARES), a technical intelligence consultancy.

""What's perhaps different in this situation is the large number of light weapons, the large number of antitank weapons, and heavy antipersonnel weapons, that are outside of state control and remain outside of state control in Ukraine,"" he said. ""And that poses, I think, a different caliber of threat to the EU.""

Jenzen-Jones says most of the weapons ARES has catalogued being used in the fighting in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russia-backed separatists were already on the territory and were either seized in raids on government arsenals or taken in battle.

Kyiv claims that Moscow, which the West and Kyiv have accused of supplying fighters and weapons to the separatists, is adding to the stockpile of weapons.

Cheap Guns, Costly Effect

According to Ukrainian media reports and government estimates, some 500,000 firearms (including assault rifles, machine guns, and pistols) have been smuggled into the Donbas since fighting erupted in eastern Ukraine in April 2014 in a conflict that has claimed more than 9,300 lives and displaced tens of thousands more.

Many of those weapons eventually end up on the black market, authorities say. And with weapons plentiful and cheap, violent crime is on the rise in Ukraine.

A report from July 2015 showed that the number of gun crimes in Ukraine had increased dramatically since the conflict erupted in the east.

Beset by a culture of corruption and struggling to end the conflict in the east, Kyiv is ill-equipped to handle the problem, argues Mark Galeotti, a professor of global affairs at New York University. ""The depressing truth is that although the Ukrainian government has begun enacting new laws to address corruption and smuggling, at present the country's ports, airports, and borders are under-controlled,"" he says. ""The country has been a smuggling hub for illicit commodities of all kinds -- from drugs and guns to people and counterfeit -- too long for this easily to be addressed.""

Global Smuggling Hub

Ukraine has been a key link in the global arms trade for some time. In September 2013, the Washington-based Center for Advanced Defense Studies released a report detailing a network of individuals and companies it said were responsible for shipping weapons to global conflict zones from the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odesa, which it dubbed the ""Odesa Network.""

Reports suggest mounting attempts to smuggle arms out of eastern Ukraine, in particular to neighboring Poland and Belarus.

Polish border guards said in January 2016 they had seized 53 weapons from smugglers over the 18 months after fighting broke out in eastern Ukraine in early 2014. That compares to only three seized smuggled arms for 2013, according to the border guards.

A Polish border-guards spokeswoman told IBTimes UK in January that border security was to be bolstered, including the building of 11 observation towers along the border.

In Belarus, arms-smuggling attempts from Ukraine are up as well. In December 2015, Leanid Maltsau, the chairman of the State Border Committee, said border guards had seized 53 weapons, as well as 500 rounds of ammunition in 2015.

The trend seems to have worsened in 2016.

On April 5, Belarusian Interior Minister Ihar Shunevich, announced that Belarusian police were to carry out a ""special operation"" aimed at curbing the growing flow of weapons from neighboring Ukraine.

Shunevich said Belarusian police had confiscated some 20 small arms from Ukraine since the beginning of 2016. He said more weapons from Ukraine were reaching Belarus. ""Unfortunately, the trend is positive. We are registering numerous facts of arms contraband from Ukraine through various channels,"" he said.

Reverse Weapons Flow

Ironically, Russia, accused of providing arms and fighters to separatists in eastern Ukraine, is dealing with an influx of arms as well from the separatist-controlled areas.

In May 2015, the Federal Security Service (FSB), which oversees border security, said it had dug 100 kilometers of ditches and put up 40 kilometers of fences in the Rostov region, which borders territory held by Russia-backed separatists in Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk regions.

The measures have been implemented ""to ensure the stability of [the Rostov region] as well as to stop illegal weapons trafficking,"" the border service said in a statement published by Rossiiskaya Gazeta, the government's official newspaper.

About 60 attempts at incoming arms smuggling have been foiled this year, resulting in the detention of more than 130 people and the confiscation of about 30 land mines, 40 firearms, 100 artillery shells, and 200 grenades, according to the daily.

And with Russia continuing to fuel the conflict in eastern Ukraine, arms smuggling will continue to pose a threat, argues John Herbst of the Washington-based Atlantic Council. He says the Donbas could become more of a risk than Transdniester, a breakaway region in Moldova that is backed by Moscow, and has become a hub for illicit trade of all types, including weapons.

""The situation in Transdniester at the present time is better than the situation in eastern Ukraine, in the Donbas, because in Transdniester it is a frozen conflict, but in the east [of Ukraine] Russia is still conducting a low-intensity war against Ukraine.""","Tue, 14 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://gdb.rferl.org/AFA3A080-48EE-4679-BBE5-1ECB0A6B4FCD_w1200_r1.jpg,"['trade', 'arms', 'weapons', 'eastern', 'ukraine', 'ukrainian', 'illicit', 'conflict', 'ripe', 'smuggling', 'flood', 'border', 'makes']",

Shanghai Disneyland opened to great fanfare earlier this week, but local media say that the behavior of some visitors still leaves a lot to be desired.

Despite the six-week long trial opening period and the Shanghai government issuing a handy etiquette guide advising guests of six things they absolutely shouldn’t do when visiting, The Paper reports that there is still much room for improvement.



Pictures taken over the first weekend following the grand opening show the ground completely covered with food wrapping, plastic bags, and paper cups.



But what really drew the ire of local reporters was the sight of a mother taking her child to defecate in an area of landscaping, rather than using the available public toilets. Looks like some people forgot to read their etiquette guide.



Back in 2014, a Chinese tourist defended his countrymen for their decision to urinate in public at the Hong Kong Disneyland owing to the lack of public toilets at the park.

According to Apple Daily, Shanghai Disneyland has even fewer washrooms, with the visitor to washroom ratio being 4,500 to 1 instead of the more generous 1,500 to 1 at the Hong Kong Disneyland.

Perhaps this sort of thing is inevitable then.

49,49,FL-2016-000064-CHN,June 13: One year on from deadly flood in Tbilisi - Agenda.ge,https://agenda.ge/en/news/2016/1436,"Today marks exactly one year since Georgia’s capital Tbilisi was hit by a deadly flash flood, which turned out to be the city’s worst human and infrastructural disaster in years.

Twenty-one people lost their lives in the flood on the evening of June 13, 2015. The bodies of two of these victims have still not been found.

More than 800 people from up to 200 families lost their homes or businesses in the natural disaster.

Tbilisi Zoo lost almost half of its animal population when the flood waters swamped the animal park in the late hours of June 13.

The disaster damaged homes, businesses and other infrastructure on more than 20 streets in central Tbilisi.

On a wider scale, the World Bank evaluation estimated the flood caused more than 100 million GEL worth of damage on Tbilisi infrastructure.

Georgia’s Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili remembered the June 13, 2015 disaster at today’s Government meeting.

He said this time last year the people in capital Tbilisi were facing one of the worst natural disasters the country has seen, and it was ""consolatory” to remember the unity that followed the disaster.

""The solidarity our younger generation showed at that horrible time was really historic,” the Prime Minister said.

""I think saying thank you is not appropriate here. The only thing I can do is to express my admiration for each of those who contributed to handling the results of the disaster.”

The Prime Minister stressed 65 families who had lost their homes had already received compensation from the Government to buy new houses.

""The vast majority of those affected have already been re-accommodated and renovations are continuing at others’ houses,” Kvirikashvili said.

He noted more than 40 million GEL had spent on restorations of infrastructure destroyed in the flood. Kvirikashvili also thanked the foreign governments who offered financial support to Tbilisi following the natural disaster.

Today’s Governmental meeting discussed the Interior Ministry’s initiative to offer better social packages to rescue officers and firefighters. In this initiative if an officer dies while on duty, their family, just like in police officers’ case, will receive 100,000 GEL immediate compensation and 1,000 GEL per month.

Commenting on this initiative Kvirikashvili said: ""Of course, I wish for a peaceful service for every rescue officer but I think it’s important to increase the state’s responsibility in front of them”.

He then mentioned the effort and sacrifice of Zurab (Zura) Muzashvili, the rescue officer who lost his life after saving seven people in the June 13 flood.

Merkel, who began Sino-German government consultations on Sunday, is in favor of giving China that status. But a number of European countries are reluctant to give up the legal defense against cheap Chinese imports.

When China became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, it accepted a non-market economy status until the end of 2016, making it easier for WTO members to impose anti-dumping duties on Chinese exports.

Dumping occurs if a company is exporting a product to another country at lower price than the normal value of the product to cut out a bigger market share and drive out competition.

But China now says that the WTO accession accord will automatically make it a market economy by the end of 2016 - a position contested by some EU members.

Much work to be done

Anger still persists within the 28-nation bloc over Beijing undercutting foreign industries with its heavily subsidized goods, particularly with massive overcapacity in sectors such as steel.

However, China's premier Li Keqiang told the news briefing that unilateral trade protection measures wouldn't help resolve the problem. Low-end steel, he said, wasn't something China wanted to produce or sell and that it was committed to phasing it out.

""China has already fulfilled its obligations on joining the WTO. What's needed now is for the other parties to fulfill the matching obligations they had promised,"" Li added, warning that China didn't want to ""fight a trade war because this will benefit nobody.""

In response, Merkel stressed the need for a level playing field for foreign firms amid growing pressure from industry to confront China more forcefully. A number of sectors, including services and construction, accuse Beijing of not following through on its reform promise of allowing foreign companies greater access to its domestic markets.

""Germany has always presented itself as an open investment market,"" Merkel said. ""We expect reciprocity also from the Chinese side.""

Li Keqiang promised that the government would take more steps based on ""the principle of treating everyone equally, with fairness and transparency.""

The analysis by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Columbia University shows for the first time how enhanced connectivity of the global network of supply can amplify production losses, as these losses can be spread more easily across countries.

""Climate damages do not only depend on the warming of our planet, but also on the resilience of our societies and economies,"" says lead author Leonie Wenz. ""Our study shows that since the beginning of the 21st century the structure of our economic system has changed in a way that production losses in one place can more easily cause further losses elsewhere."" The study examines the example of local heat-stress-related productivity reductions causing global effects. Across the world, production is interlinked. ""What is self-evident for us today is really a phenomenon of the last two decades,"" Wenz explains.

From typhoons to heat-stress on workers: local events, global effects

Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines destroyed more than half the world's production of coconut oil which is one of the two most commonly used vegetable fats in food production worldwide. The 2011 flood in Queensland stopped production in the fourth biggest coal exploration site on Earth for weeks, with economic repercussions well beyond Australia. While single major shocks to economic networks like these illustrate how economic activity is globally linked, the researchers focused on the effects of small daily perturbations due to extreme temperatures leading to heat-stress among workers in construction, agriculture and other economic sectors. Previous research shows that increasing temperatures decrease productivity, because, for instance, workers get exhausted more rapidly.

The study covers economic flows between 26 industry sectors from mining and quarrying to textiles and wearing apparel and to post and telecommunications as well as final demand in 186 countries. Combining data on temperature, population and the global economic network from 1991-2011 and based on existing research on temperature effects on workers, the scientists run computer simulations of heat-stress consequences in order to find out more about the network's vulnerability to the propagation of production losses in each year.

""This is the basis for implementing appropriate adaptation measures""

""With unabated climate change, the effects of increasing weather extremes, like most recently seen in Paris, will have severe impacts on natural and societal systems,"" says co-author Anders Levermann. ""To estimate the costs of future climate change we need to assess global economic impacts of more frequent heat extremes and meteorological impacts, such as floods and tropical storms, and understand their relation to the economic network's structure. This is the basis for implementing appropriate adaptation measures -- in a warming world with more intense weather extremes it is likely that society needs to become more resilient and more flexible.""","Fri, 10 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",,"['globalization', 'global', 'climate', 'research', 'change', 'study', 'effects', 'heatstress', 'vulnerable', 'shows', 'production', 'workers', 'economic', 'losses']", 
56,56,FL-2016-000064-CHN,"To control Bihar's floods, understanding river Kamla is crucial - Scroll.in",https://scroll.in/article/809701/to-control-bihars-floods-understanding-river-kamla-is-crucial,"“When I was a boy, a family and their livestock could feed on just one crop for three years,” said Jugal Mandal of Sakhwar village in Darbhanga district. “For the last five years though, the village fields have been fallow because we have not had water.""

Mandal's plight could come as a surprise to those who associate Bihar with floods. There is so much media attention on the massive and sudden flooding in Bihar that the state's rivers have earned the moniker the sorrow of Bihar. Though it is Kosi that is often called this, Kamla, too, carries her share of the blame.

The truth, however, is more than what meets the eye.

An old stream of Kamla at Rampatti

The Kamla river enters India near Jaynagar in Madhubani district in Bihar from Nepal, where it originates. By then, it is already a sizeable river, having been met by several tributaries in Nepal. It also has a stream, Bachraja, that takes off from the river. As a recent development in its course, Kamla, soon after it enters India, joins the Balan river.

Prior to 1954, Bachraja was the main stream of Kamla. But a severe flood in 1954 made Kamla change its course and join Balan, leading to what is now called Kamla Balan. Kamla, referred by the locals as unmarried, thanks to its restless nature – as opposed to rivers that have a defined course and stay steady on it – does this sudden turn in course quite frequently. As a result, the Kamla river basin is criss-crossed with a number of old channels which are empty now. Authors Dinesh Kumar Mishra in Kamala: River and People on a Collision Course and Havaldar Tripathi in Bihar ki Nadiyan- Aithihasik evam Sanskrutik Sarvekshan have mentioned five channels of the Kamla, including the present one.

The history of floods

Kamla floods regularly in monsoon. The traditional system of interconnected village tanks and chaurs, or wetlands, has long sponged up the worst of the floods. This role was shared by the paleo channels. Gajanan Mishra, Joint Secretary of Bihar Water Resources Department, termed these water bodies as detention spaces that take in the initial surge of the flood water. The spread of the river water over the land would also replenish the fertile soil.

Observing that everything has changed now, Mandal said that during his childhood, there was no need to use the plough in the farm. ""All you needed to do was broadcast the seed and then harvest a bumper crop.""

Simultaneous flood and drought

It is Kamla that has changed. The construction of embankments in the mid-1960s cut off the links the river had with the paleo channels and the chaur-pond system. This had two direct, but contrasting, impacts.

First, the embankments increased the intensity of the floods for those living within them. ""The ground level within the embankments of Kamla-Balan as well as the bed levels of the river are rising, resulting in higher stages of flood, even with comparatively lower discharge,"" said Mishra. “It was 52.73 meters at Jhanjharpur for 1,600 cubic metre per second discharge in 1987, while the flood level was only 50.42 meters for 1,964 cubic metre per second discharge in 1966.” This increases both the intensity of the floods for a given discharge as also the vulnerability of the embankments. The breaches that occurred in the embankments also led to intense floods in the surrounding areas. On the other hand, the traditional ""detention spaces"" were bereft of water, leading to crop failure in those villages.

Fallow fields of Sakhwar

This lack of irrigation water was lamented by people all along Kamla’s paleo channels – the Jiwach Kamla, Sakri Kamla, Patghat Kamla, and Bachraja Dhar. The residents of the Sakhwar village would once grow three lush crops a year. Since the 1990s, however, they have only managed one poor crop in the monsoon. This year, several fields lie fallow. This has also had a significant impact on the fish species. The chaurs and the ponds are important habitats of fish and other aquatic species, which are used to fresh water and nutrients that get replenished regularly. Now, they are limited to stagnant pools.

Livestock herding, especially buffaloes, used to be a major source of supplementary income for the people here. The presence of water in the chaur-pond systems as well as in the many old channels of Kamla meant that the buffalo herders from as far as Jharkhand would migrate to the Kamla basin in the summer. With the embankments, and the subsequent drying out of the old channels, this has changed. Most of the farmers in Darbhanga and Madhubani districts are struggling to find water for their buffaloes to bathe in the summer afternoon. The inability to do this results in the buffaloes falling ill, sometimes fatally.

Unable to maintain the livestock or to provide protective irrigation for their crops, many villagers are left with no option but to migrate.

This dearth of irrigation is despite the ambitious Kosi irrigation project. Built at a cost of Rs 105 crores, the eastern canal was damaged in the floods in 2008 and is now defunct. The construction of the western canal, which is estimated to cost Rs 1307.21 crore (for the Indian portion only), began in 1971 but is yet to be completed.

What is the solution?

Narayanjee Chaudhary of Mithila Gram Vikas Parishad proposes that the embankments be linked again to the paleo channels. This, confirmed an engineer of Bihar Water Resources Department, can be done using sluice gates at the embankments. Chaudhary is not alone in proposing this intervention. The idea of using older channels as a flood-mitigation strategy has a long and venerable history. It was first proposed in 1941 by the then executive engineer of Public Works Department of Bihar, Rai Bahadur Prafulla Chandra Ghosh, in his report, ""Comprehensive Treatise on north Bihar flood problem"". He suggested that the floodwaters of Kosi be diverted into the old channels, thus lessening the load on any one stream. According to Dinesh Kumar Mishra, this solution was proposed by Ganga Flood Control Commission, Government of India as well in 1991 in a report on Performance Evaluation of Embankment Scheme, on both banks of Kamla Balan.

What does this entail? First, the existing chaur-pond networks need to be revived. This will include desilting both the water bodies as well as interlinking the channels. Then, sluice gates need to be constructed in the embankments that will reconnect Kamla Balan to its old channels at the point of diversion. Once this is done, floodwaters can be diverted into these water bodies. If one considers that there are four such paleo channels with a total length of 800 kilometers, then it is conceivable that this system can absorb at least four times the magnitude of the normal flow of Kamla.



This is the system conceived and supported by the past and present engineers and thinkers of Bihar.

Ram Dinesh Yadav, a farmer in Inarva village near Khajauli proposed a refinement to this plan. His farm is a scant 400 metres from the Western Kosi Canal, but his fields still lie fallow due to lack of water. “If there is a system of small check dams in the old channels of the river, the flood waters can be retained for at least a season and this will allow us to have the Rabi crop,"" Yadav said. This is technically feasible and can probably be financed through funds from The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act or the zilla parishad. Once the desilting and the sluice gate system are set up, there is no reason why Kamla's paleo channels cannot provide protective irrigation for the fields.

This is not about inter-linking rivers. All the old streams are not only part of the same basin, but the connections also already exist. The natural connections between the river's present stream and its older channels have been artificially disrupted, and it is now a matter of finding ways to restore them. Thus, it is not a case of controlled flooding; it is giving the river enough room to flow into its natural streams without compelling it to carve out a new path by breaching the embankments.

The impact of flood control

Flood control is the major benefit obtained by reconnecting the paleo-channel network of Kamla to the main stream. The second benefit, no less important, is that of irrigation.

Presently, the embankments and the overall neglect of the river have destroyed the natural connection of the Kamla-Balan main stream with its earlier channels. This means that villages and the fields that were once on the banks of a perennial river are now deprived of even the monsoon flow. Restoring this network will enable them to at least practice protective irrigation and maintain livestock.

According to Chaudhary, the canals of the Kosi system are built on productive farmland. At present, they are not fully functional, which means that the loss of fertile land cannot even be justified by irrigation. At the same time, fully adequate water channels already exist. Since people settled by the banks of rivers, their fields are still based along these paleo channels. Thus, if water is let into these, there is no need for a distribution network, which would prove to be a major saving for the government exchequer. Besides this, restoring the chaur-pond networks will also restore the ecosystems for these water bodies to sustain.

The number of Chinese tourists visiting Paris has surged in recent years as a result of simplified visa procedures and strong promotion of Sino-French tourism agencies.The number of Chinese visitors didn't drop despite the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris.

This year's first quarter saw the number of Chinese visitors who traveled to France jump to 6.5 percent year-on-year. In 2015, about 1.2 million Chinese tourists visited Paris, surging 49 percent over the previous year.

Charles De Gaulle Airport in Paris, the second largest airport in Europe, annually receives 2.1 million Chinese tourists who travel between China and France. But differences in language and culture, and information asymmetry, have caused many travel inconveniences for Chinese tourists.

Chinese travel information website Qyer.com recently launched the first Chinese version travel guidebook for Paris, and they are available at the arrival halls of Paris airports, and several other well-known tourist attractions, including Palace of Versailles, Disneyland and French department store Galeries Lafayette.

The brochure aims to provide free visual information for Chinese travelers after they land in Paris. The guidebook summarizes essential information of restaurants, accommodation, traveling, and entertainment and shopping, it also includes some coupons that can be used at airport duty free stores.

Cai Jinghui, chief executive of Qyer.com, said,""Qyer.com launched travel guides in Melbourne, Tasmania and Boston before, and they often run out of stock. We believe that it will be quite useful and popular for Chinese tourists in Paris.""

According to Aéroports de Paris, the number of Chinese tourists who visited Paris takes only 2 percent of the total tourists, but the average spending for Chinese at the airport reaches about 100 euros per person, far more than the 15 euros of those tourists who come from other countries.

Laure Baume, executive director of Customer Division at Aéroports de Paris, said, ""Charles De Gaulle Airport has been increasing its related Chinese services. The airport equipped 150 Chinese shopping guides at the stores, and it had Chinese guides to help visitors with tax refund procedures.""

Meanwhile, Charles De Gaulle Airport added Chinese language as its third official language after English and French on airport signs last year.

Scores of people lose their lives to flood and landslide in Kaski every year. The concerned government agencies, however, are doing nothing to make people take precautionary measures or shift them to safer places.

In the fiscal 2014/15, 36 persons were swept away by landslips and floods in Kaski, almost the same number of deaths caused by natural calamities as in the last fiscal.

Most of the 32 VDCs in Kaski are at risk of landslide. Many city areas too are at risk of inundation and erosion.

Kaski CDO and District Disaster Rescue Committee Kaski Chairman Hari Prasad Mainali admitted that no precautionary or evacuation programme was in place. Mainali said that a team of security force had been put on standby and would be dispatched when disaster struck.

Information Officer Bishnu Pokhrel at District Soil Conservation Office Kaski said many areas in Kaski were topographically fragile. Besides, most of the settlements on river banks were at risk of inundation. Pokhrel said people living near flood and landslide prone areas should think twice before settling there.

More than 3,000 houses in Pokhara Sub-metropolis are at high risk of landslip and flood, while over 5,000 houses in the villages are at the risk of disasters.

A meeting of the District Disaster Rescue Committee Kaski held two days ago issued a directive to VDC secretaries to collect data on settlements prone to flood and landslide.

As many as 28 people were killed in floods in the Seti River, while some 35 people had gone missing five years ago. According to Pokhrel, more than 2,000 families of Sardikhola, Hemja, Simpani, Mahendrapul, Ramghat on the banks of Seti River are living at high risk of flood and mudslide.

Similarly, Bijayapur, Kanhukhola, Fusre, Kali and Harpan Khola too are posing risk to human settlements inside the sub-metropolis. Pokhrel said some settlements are at high risk of flood and inundation in Lekhnath Municipality.

Last year, six people were killed in the flood in Dhada khola in Bhadaure.

Many VDCs, including Lumle, Chapakot, Salyan, Dangsingh, Sarangkot, Armala, Deurali, Rupakot, Bhachowk, Parche, Mauja, are at high risk of landslide.

Nepal Red Cross Society Kaski Chair Bamdev Dhungana said as since many places in Kaski are at high risk of flood and mudslide, settlements in fragile areas must be shifted to safer places.

Dhungana said his office had directed to the members of 55 branches of Red Cross Society across the district to stay on high alert to rescue people from natural disasters during monsoon.","Mon, 20 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://thehimalayantimes.com/theme_himalayantimes/images/no-image.jpg,"['settlements', 'district', 'areas', 'pokhrel', 'landslip', 'kaski', 'river', 'high', 'flood', 'rescue', 'risk']",

But, U.S. steelmakers won't get the all-out ban on Chinese imports they requested.

The ruling is a victory for Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, which asked the International Trade Commission to recommend a ban on Chinese steel earlier this year.

It argued China hurt U.S. business by over-subsidizing its own producers and flooding the market with a cheap product.

But instead of a ban on Chinese steel, the Commerce Department will be allowed to slap a tariff of more than 500 percent on Chinese steel imports.

That's twice what it proposed in March, before the ITC investigation was finished.

Tim Slaper at the Indiana Business Research Center says a ban would have had ""more teeth"" for steelmakers in Northwest Indiana and elsewhere, though he notes China isn't their only competitor.

Still, he says the tariff will work to reduce Chinese imports.

“So it would increase the market share, then, of domestic suppliers,” he says.

62,62,FL-2016-000064-CHN,Can cement clean up its act? - chinadialogue,https://chinadialogue.net/en/pollution/9001-can-cement-clean-up-its-act/,"Cement is the most widely used substance on the planet after water. It is also one of the most polluting – producing between 5-8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than twice than that attributed to aviation. Cement’s carbon footprint increases every year with huge demands for building materials, particularly in China, India and large parts of the developing world.

In some ways, the global cement industry has been more receptive to the green agenda than some fossil fuel energy companies and large utilities. Cement makers have signed up to voluntary emissions cuts, reassured they will play a key role producing the materials needed for a low carbon world – from building hydropower dams to fixing wind turbines.

At the Paris climate summit last year, Heidelberg Cement and 16 other cement manufacturers went further and promised to decarbonise their production by 2030. The effort, they claimed, will lead to a 10% worldwide reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

But demand for cement is growing faster than emissions per tonne are falling, leading to an overall increase in emissions. What’s more, two thirds of the sector’s emissions come from the chemical reaction induced when cement ingredients are mixed in the kiln. This means the industry’s environmental headache will only grow.

“We are convinced we have to do something on CO2 emissions in a proactive way,” said Rob van der Meer, public affairs director on global environmental sustainability for Germany’s giant Heidelberg Cement, one of the world’s largest producers.

So far, Heidelberg has made cuts by boosting the energy efficiency of its operations, replacing coal with renewable alternatives such a biomass and waste material, and substituting a proportion of emissions-intensive clinker in cement with cleaner materials.

But all these processes have their limitations. “All of this will result in 30% reductions in emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels – but this is not enough to limit to (a rise in global warming to) 2C,” says van der Meer.

A more radical solution is needed. Some scientists have proposed ways to produce “carbon zero” cement using binding agents derived from oil and silicon. California-based Calera Corp has even found ways for cement production to absorb more carbon than it releases, similar to how certain corals produce reefs by excreting dissolved calcium carbonate or limestone.

But none of these new technologies have achieved commercial success or been proven at scale.

The case for CCS

The industry has latched on to Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology as its insurance against future curbs on carbon. CCS is an umbrella term for a range of methods to suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at the point of source and store it underground. But some critics see the idea as a non-starter because it locks dirty fossil fuel power plants into future energy systems and deflects funding for renewable alternatives. However, advocates point out there is a big difference in using CCS for industrial processes, for which there are no alternatives so far.

“There will be carbon capture…We see it as a necessity for our sector, we cannot escape it,” said van der Meer.

It’s not just the cement industry. Scientists and climate researchers are warning that the world can’t meet the Paris targets and cap global warming at 2C without developing new technologies to suck carbon dioxide out of the air. The IEA views the technology as the most cost effective way of delivering around a fifth of required global carbon reductions (based on a certain number of CCS plants being operational by 2050).



Source: IEA Cement Roadmap​

Industrial CCS is the cornerstone of the European Commission’s plans to cut emissions 95% by 2030. It is also a key part of the UK’s energy strategy to meet its own climate targets enshrined in law, given the country’s dependence on oil and gas.

However, the necessary funding and support has failed to emerge.“It’s a desperate situation” says Jonas Helseth, policy officer at Bellona, a Norwegian think tank: “Lack of action on CCS is undermining the world’s ability to counter climate change.”

Pilots

Heidelberg has thrown itself into CCS research and development, in collaboration with the European Cement Research Academy. In Norway, they have finished testing a carbon capture project at the major NORCEM cement factory last year in Brevik, and are now waiting for the government to figure out a funding mechanism to develop a full scale demonstration project.

The project will capture 50% of emissions by extracting CO2 out of the cement plant’s smokestack flue gas. If all goes to plan, the plant will become Norway’s third operational CCS project by 2020, catching up to 400,000 tonnes of CO2, piping it for storage in an underwater continental shelf, or converted into low carbon biofuel for transport.

The Norwegian government has provided 75% of the €12 million (90 million yuan) investment, and Heidelberg hopes this will act as a blueprint for future production plants with carbon capture.

Another cement pilot plant is being developed by a consortium of companies at Lixhe in Belgium, funded by the European Commission, as well as pilots in Texas.

Fits and starts

But despite the emergence of some projects, delays, rising costs and protests have plagued the development of CCS since the Norwegian energy giant Statoil proposed the concept more than two decades ago.

Pilot projects have floundered across Europe. To the shock of investors, last year the UK government unexpectedly pulled £1 billion (9.6 billion yuan) of funding from the White Rose CCS Commercialisation project, weeks before the final bid.

Without further government funding, the Norwegian project is out of the question, Heidelberg’s van der Meer admits.

Storage woes

The dilemma of where to put the captured carbon poses is similar to that of where to bury nuclear waste. The Brevik project has been plagued by protests by locals worried about the disastrous consequences of stored CO2 escaping even from a deep geological deposit.

The plant, incidentally, was the scene of one of Norway’s worst pollution accident in 2001 when at least 750 tonnes of toxic sludge poured into the local harbour and fjord waters. Local authorities have refused the use of the harbour and mine to store carbon because it is close to a large population of people.

“CCS is basically about taking a problem and stuffing it away under the carpet,” Rasmus Hansson, parliamentary leader of Norway’s Green party has said in a recent interview with The Guardian. “We will then live with the statistical risk of some gigantic underground burp.”

The immense costs of building CCS projects, and rock bottom prices for carbon in the EU’s dysfunctional Emissions Trading Scheme (ensuring the incentives for CCS are weak), further threaten the future commercial viability of the technology.

Leakage

Cement makers have more immediate concerns of their own. If competitors in Eastern Europe, Turkey and Asia flood the market with cheap cement, CCS becomes a less attractive option.

“It will increase our costs by 50% and our competitors outside of Norway will come into the market with cheap cement,” says van de Meer.

The China question

If cement is going to clean up its act, a lot rides on what happens in China – where 60% of global cement is produced – at the moment mostly from old fashioned small plants with coal-fired, smoke-spewing furnaces.

CCS is a key part of China’s national climate change programme – but apart from investing in a cement pilot in Texas, the focus has been on curbing emissions from coal-fired power plants rather than cleaning up heavy industry.

Cement production is expected to peak in China by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency, and future demand will be driven by India and other developing countries in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.","Fri, 10 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.chinadialogue.net/content/uploads/2020/05/20080941/Stockage_de_ciments-scaled.jpg,"['cement', 'clean', 'global', 'act', 'carbon', 'future', 'van', 'ccs', 'emissions', 'energy', 'project', 'plants']", 
63,63,FL-2016-000064-CHN,Former UI student Xiangnan Li sentenced to life in prison for murder of Tong Shao - The Gazette,https://www.thegazette.com/news/former-ui-student-xiangnan-li-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-murder-of-tong-shao/,"IOWA CITY — Former University of Iowa student Xiangnan Li was convicted of murdering his girlfriend Tong Shao and has been sentenced to life in prison.

Johnson County Attorney Janet Lyness confirmed the verdict and sentencing on Wednesday. She learned of the news Wednesday afternoon from the Department of Justice, she said.

'I'm very happy they convicted him and also that he got the same sentence he would have gotten if convicted here of first-degree murder,' Lyness said.

Li's conviction brings to close a case that began in Iowa nearly two years ago and ended in China after Chinese authorities took over the case last year.

Li is accused of killing Shao — an Iowa State University student — on Sept. 7, 2014. The pair of Chinese international students checked into a hotel in Nevada, Iowa, on Sept. 5 and Shao was last seen alive at the hotel on Sept. 6. Police said Li made arrangements to fly back to China that same day.

Shao was later reported missing by her roommates and her body was found in the trunk of her car on Sept. 26 in Iowa City. Authorities said Shao was strangled. Chinese prosecutors said Li purchased a suitcase and two dumb bells and intended to sink the body in a nearby pond, but abandoned that plan.

During a trial in Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Providence, Li admitted to killing Shao after a falling out over her alleged new boyfriend, according to a CNN report.

Li was identified as a person of interest in the trial from the onset of the investigation, but a lack of extradition treaty with China hampered the progress of the criminal case. Li eventually turned himself into law enforcement in Wenzhou on May 13, 2015.

In June 2015, Chinese officials came to Johnson County and Lyness turned over the case against Li after several days of meetings. Later in June, Li was charged in China with intentional homicide.

Two Iowa City police investigators and an assistant Johnson County attorney went to China in March to observe the proceedings. Li admitted guilt during the trial, but at the time, Chinese authorities said they would not release the verdict or sentence for up to six months.

An attorney for Shao's parents told CNN they accepted 2 million yaun — about $308,000 — in compensation from Li's family before the start of the trial.

Although Lyness initially expressed concerns with turning over the case to the Chinese, on Wednesday she praised their work and the unique circumstances of the collaboration.

'I think it really is a great example of the United States and China working together to try to bring justice for a victim of crime,' she said. 'We're very pleased with the results … We're just very pleased with how it went.'

The geography of wine – the product obtained exclusively from the total or partial fermentation of fresh grapes – can be viewed both from the perspective of producers or consumers. This cartogram visually depicts the consumer side of a market that has undergone some major regional shifts over the past decades. It shows the countries of the world resized in proportion to their absolute annual wine consumption in recent years. The largest absolute consumers are also labelled. The map also indicates those countries’ production levels (shown by the bottle infographics).

The world’s annual consumption of wine is almost 250 million hectolitres (one hectolitre = 100 litres). That corresponds to the volume of 10,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. The United States accounts for 30 million hectolitres and has, in recent years, become the world’s largest market for wine – a position it took over from France in 2013. However, with an annual consumption per capita of around ten litres, the United States has a lower consumption per capita than almost all other wine-producing countries. France, for example, has a per capita consumption level of 48 litres and even Greece and Belgium outdo the States at 26 litres and 28 litres per capita of consumption respectively (South Africa’s per capita consumption figures were unavailable at time of going to print).

“Wine is produced commercially in more than 70 countries, three of which account for almost half of the world’s production: France, Italy and Spain”

A relative newcomer in this map is China, which has more than tripled its consumption in just a decade. China is the world’s fifth largest market for wine at almost 18 million hectolitres per year. However, the country’s annual consumption per capita is still modest at just 1.3 litres.

The world’s annual production is around 270 million hectolitres (varying significantly from one year to another, primarily depending on weather conditions) and wine is produced commercially in more than 70 countries, three of which account for almost half of the world’s production: France, Italy and Spain. Vineyards with wine grapes cover an area of around 54,000 square kilometres which equals the size of eight million football fields. Red varieties make up around 60 per cent of the grapes.

The figures for this month’s cartogram were produced in collaboration with Morten Scholer using data by the International Organization of Vine and Wine, the World Wine Trade Group and the Wine Institute (California). They reflect the average production and consumption from the years 2011 to 2014.

65,65,FL-2016-000064-CHN,"Legal ivory sale drove dramatic increase in elephant poaching, study shows - The Guardian",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/13/legal-ivory-sale-drove-dramatic-increase-in-elephant-poaching-study-shows,"A huge legal sale of ivory intended to cut elephant poaching instead catastrophically backfired by dramatically increasing elephant deaths, according to new research.



The revelation comes just months before a decision on whether to permit another legal sale and against a backdrop of more African elephants being killed for ivory than are being born. In 2015 alone, 20,000 elephants were illegally killed.

The international trade in ivory was banned in 1989 but, in 2008, China and Japan were allowed to pay $15m for 107 tonnes of ivory stockpiled from elephants that died naturally in four African nations. The intention was to flood the market, crash prices and make poaching less profitable.

But instead, the legal sale was followed by “an abrupt, significant, permanent, robust and geographically widespread increase” in elephant poaching, concluded researchers Prof Solomon Hsiang at the University of California Berkeley and Nitin Sekar at Princeton University, whose work was published on Monday.

“We now have pretty striking evidence that these sales can be catastrophic. It backfired in a very bad way,” Hsiang told the Guardian. “I used to be a big proponent of legalisation in general to reduce the adverse effects of black markets. But through doing this work I have realised you have to be much more cautious. My own views have changed dramatically.”

The researchers think the legal sale reduced the stigma of ivory, boosting demand, and provided cover for the smuggling of illegal ivory, boosting supply. So, while the price of ivory fell after the legal sale, poaching increased.

The trade in threatened animals is governed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), a treaty agreed by 181 nations and the European Union. Its next summit in September will vote on a proposal from Zimbabwe and Namibia for another legal sale.

Prof Christopher Alden, at the London School of Economics, who is not involved on the new analysis, said: “The linkage [of the 2008 sale] with the surge in poaching is a sound one based on rigorous scholarly research.”

“The likelihood that the proposal from Zimbabwe and Namibia will produce a similar effect is therefore a very strong one,” Prof Alden said. “The specious arguments being made by proponents of once-off sales are, I am afraid, ill-disguised and self-serving.”

He said it was true that the elephant poaching crisis in east Africa has yet to hit southern Africa as hard, but that it was very likely to do so if a new sale was allowed: “[The proposal] is deeply disingenuous and one which flies in the face of the contemporary moves by China and the US to shut down the market for ivory.”

The new analysis was possible because poachers do not hide or destroy the carcasses of the elephants they poach. “It’s not worth the trouble,” said Hsiang. “So they’ve basically left us a complete and visible record of their activity.”

The 2008 ivory sale also corresponded with a 70% rise in the seizures of illegal ivory. The surges in poaching and seizures occurred right across Africa and the researchers checked for other factors that might have been involved, such as an increase in Chinese workers in Africa or rising affluence in China or Japan.

“We looked for alternative explanations in the data, but the best evidence still indicates that the legal sale exacerbated the destruction of elephant populations across Africa,” Sekar said.

Hsiang does not blame Cites for the backfiring of the sale, which was approved by a unanimous vote of its member states: “Before the sale, many economists has said it was the right thing to do. We think Cites were doing the best they could. Our work is intended to support future policy.”

A spokesman for Cites said: “The secretariat does not argue for or against the one-off sales. These decisions were taken by Cites [countries] in the context of the conditions that prevailed at the time. The secretariat welcomes this ongoing research and analysis and will continue to closely monitor all relevant findings.”

He noted that Cites monitoring of elephant poaching had not in the past seen a direct correlation between legal sales and increased demand in Asia. Hsiang said this might be because the data is smoothed to give long-term trends.

The Cites spokesman also noted that there had never been a one-off sale of rhino horn: “However, the spike in the number of rhinos poached for horn largely mirrors what has been seen with ivory. The illegal killing of rhino for its horn in South Africa alone increased from 13 in 2007 to close to 1,200 last year.”

An alternative to selling off stockpiles of ivory is to burn them, but this has also now come under scrutiny. On 30 April, Kenya burned 105 tonnes of ivory, making a total of 263 tonnes destroyed by 21 countries since 1989, mostly in the last five years.

But Duan Biggs, at the University of Queensland in Australia and writing in the journal Nature last week, said: “There is no published evidence so far that these events reduce poaching. Destroying ivory stockpiles risks a perverse outcome: ivory becomes rarer, fetching higher prices and increasing poaching and illegal stockpiling.”

“It is therefore crucial to track the effects of Kenya’s largest-ever ivory burn. Time is short and the stakes are high,” he said.

Hsiang said: “In policy, when we see things that are terrible, it’s natural to want to do something. But it’s important to remember that our actions might make them even worse.”

“Simple intuition is powerful and can sometimes get us really far in policy, but when incomplete it can also lead us into traps,” he said. “I am a complete advocate of looking into the data and determining whether these sorts of policies work. We need to carefully evaluate the effect and then be very open minded about the results.”","Mon, 13 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4b76bbf22745e743c6ac33872b5cc9d99adad5f/0_129_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=78a1ef74b550e1f63102935f96683d5f,"['elephant', 'sales', 'illegal', 'study', 'increase', 'dramatic', 'work', 'sale', 'legal', 'shows', 'poaching', 'drove', 'africa', 'cites', 'ivory']",

Many char areas have been flooded in the last 24 hours, bringing untold sufferings to residents of those areas. The Teesta was flowing only one centimetre below the danger level of 52.4cm at Teesta Barrage point of Doyani in Hatibandha upazila as of yesterday afternoon.

Mostafizur Rahman, executive engineer of Water Development Board (WDB) at Dalia, said all 44 gates of Teesta Barrage have been kept open since Wednesday night due to pressure of upstream water.

“The Indian Gajoldoba Barrage authorities have informed me that they kept open all the gates of the barrage due to pressure of water flowing from upstream Sikkim,” he added.

He said they have been monitoring the water level of the river. “We will alert the char and shoal people if the river crosses the danger level,” he said, warning that the water level might cross the danger level anytime.

Mobarak Hossain, 35, of Char Gaddimari village in Hatibandha said their shoal was flooded yesterday morning and they were using bamboo-made rafts to maintain connection with the mainland.

Mofazzal Hossain, chairman of Rajpur Union Parishad in Lalmonirhat Sadar, said char and shoal people always live in flood situations during the rainy season as the river overflows following normal downpour upstream.

The riverbed has lost its depth because of silt and mud settling there for years, said WDB Executive Engineer of Lalmonirhat Abu Bakkar. He added it is necessary to dredge the river so that it can capture additional water during rains.

A large area in Jalpaiguri district in West Bengal and northern Bangladesh has been flooded as excessive water has been released through the two barrages in Sikkim and West Bengal states, reports our Kolkata correspondent Subrata Acharya.

The release of water has created danger of large-scale flood in Bangladesh's northern districts.

Insiders said excessive water has been released from the Gajoldoba barrage in West Bengal due to flash flood caused by untimely rainfall. The government sources say 1,200 cusec of water has been released, but locals claim the amount would be several times higher.

It has been apprehended that low-lying areas fed by the Teesta in Bangladesh will be affected by the flash flood.

Contacted over cellphone, West Bengal Irrigation Minister Rajib Banerjee yesterday told this correspondent that the Barrage sources informed him that 1,200 cusec water was released on Tuesday.

Asked if they had considered that the water released from the barrage might affect Bangladesh, the minister said, “The water has been released by Sikkim. As Sikkim is on the upstream when water is released, it will flow downwards. However, Sikkim should have given us a note before releasing the water.”

However, Rajib Banerjee expressed sorrow over the creation of flood situations in Bangladesh. He said, “We don't want any neighbouring country to be affected due to us.”

West Bengal state government has meanwhile issued a “Yellow Alert” from Domohani at Teesta to bordering Mekhliganj since Tuesday morning.

The western districts in West Bengal have been experiencing heavy rainfall for the last one week due to a depression. The rainfall caused pressure of excessive water on Gajoldoba barrage due to flash flood.

Local people have complained that the authorities concerned released water at Gajoldoba without any prior announcement.","Sat, 18 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/teesta_river_1.jpg?itok=fcJVxfSd,"['water', 'sikkim', 'threat', 'west', 'teesta', 'lakh', 'river', 'released', 'bengal', 'barrage', 'flood', 'danger', 'level']",

The Nepali Army has drained one metre of water from Imja Glacier Lake in Solukhumbu in three weeks under the 7.2 million dollar Community Based Flood and Glacial Lake Outburst Risk Reduction Project being operated by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology.

The project aims to reduce possible loss of human lives and infrastructure from a glacial lake outburst flooding in Solukhumbu and the downstream area of Mahottari, Siraha, Saptari and Udaypur.

NA personnel have been using excavators and other equipment to release the accumulated water in the lake since June 1. According to the NA, they had started to release the accumulated water by digging temporary outlet channel.

“As the channel outlet is helping release the reserved water, the water level in the lake has decreased by at least one metre so far,” Lieutenant Colonel Bharat Lal Shrestha, chief of field team of Nepali Army in Imja, told The Himalayan Times.

He added, “We are trying to finish work within two months by adjusting with the risky weather.” Earlier, as only little amount of water was released from the lake through natural flow, the NA had started work to prevent glacial lake outburst flood.

NA personnel have constructed a three-metre wide and 1.5-metre deep outlet channel to drain the water. As many as 40 personnel from the national security force have been deployed for the task.

The army aims to lower the water level up to three metres by October.

Besides army personnel, 62 civilians are also involved in draining the water of Imja Glacial Lake.

Despite unfavourable weather lasting almost 22 hours a day, NA personnel have been carrying out work in the snowy weather. “The weather remains friendly for just two hours in the morning,” Lieutenant Colonel Shrestha said.

He added that 40 per cent of the work has been completed. Around 10 km south from the world’s highest peak Mt Everest, Imja Lake is situated at 5,010 metres above sea level in the Khumbu region.

Due to the difficult terrain, Nepali Army had airlifted the excavator to dig the channel.

Spokesperson of Nepali Army, Tara Bahadur Karki, said it was NA’s first experience in disaster risk mitigation programme. “Though we were involved in various rescue operations earlier, this kind of work at a height of 5,010 metres was our first experience” he said.

The glacial lake is 180 metres deep, two-km long, 650-metre wide and is spread over 130 hectares. The surface area of the lake is said to have expanded from 0.4 to 1.01 square kilometres between 1984 and 2009 due to rapid melting of snow.

The programme to drain the lake water was funded by United Nations Development Programme and the Global Environment Facility.

An estimated 96,562 vulnerable people are living in the downstream areas. A total of 3,808 glaciers and 1,466 glacial lakes have been identified in Nepal.

Around 20 glacial lakes pose high risk of glacial lake outburst floods due to climate change.","Thu, 23 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://thehimalayantimes.com/theme_himalayantimes/images/no-image.jpg,"['water', 'lake', 'work', 'weather', 'drain', 'metres', 'imja', 'outburst', 'army', 'metre', 'personnel', 'nepali', 'glacial']",

Elizabeth Shafiroff, 29, and Lindsey Spielfogel, 30, plan to bring protest pooches to the enclave Friday to rally opposition against the canine cuisine conference slated for next week.

The animal rights activists with the group Global Strays say they want to raise awareness with Chinese-Americans and hope they will join their cause to ban the gathering.

Opponents have gathered more than 11 million signatures worldwide to protest the annual festival in China’s southern Yulin province.

“This is a horrible event,” Shafiroff told The Post. “So we want to do what we can here locally to fight it. There are a lot of Chinese-Americans who oppose what’s happening there.”

Shafiroff said she and her colleague plan to take out ads in local Chinese language newspapers decrying the festival.

They will also bring nearly a dozen dogs to Chinatown Friday as part of their campaign and will plaster the area with purple anti-animal abuse ribbons.

In addition, the pair are organizing a boycott of all Chinese-made pet supply products sold in local shops.

“This is a massive industry,” Spielfogel said. “They are making money off of these animals while at the same time holding an event like this. We want it to stop.”

“The largest Chinese community in America is right here in New York,” Shafiroff said. “That’s why we feel its important to get the word out locally.”

Several thousand dogs are slaughtered and served in restaurants during the annual gathering.

Proponents argue that its an honored part of Chinese heritage. Feeding on fido, they argue, is really no different than eating cows and chickens.

A small minority of Chinese actually dine on dog as the animal has increasingly become viewed as more of a protected companion than culinary target.","Thu, 16 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/06/millenials-dog.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200,"['descend', 'chinese', 'protests', 'dog', 'local', 'fight', 'chinatown', 'pair', 'protest', 'shafiroff', 'spielfogel', 'event', 'plan', 'festival', 'eating']",

But its demise doesn't necessarily mean we're done with wild weather.

The recent climate event -- characterized by warming waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean -- has been one of the strongest ever recorded, and its impact has been felt far and wide.

The weather system may even have contributed to the spread of Zika by creating conditions that helped mosquito populations thrive.

So now that El Niño has definitely dissipated , is it finally time for us to breathe a sigh of relief and celebrate the fact it won't be back for another two to seven years?

Maybe not.

Because La Niña is hot on El Niño's heels -- and here's what we can expect from the weather system's flip side.

Will Asia bear the brunt?

Just as with El Niño, the most consistent and significant impact will be noticed in the regions that border the Pacific Ocean, where the winds and ocean temperatures show the greatest variation.

This rainfall will be welcome in some areas, as El Niño fueled droughts have plagued much of Southeast Asia for the past several months.

La Niña is also expected to give a boost to the Southwest Monsoon over India, which after two disastrous, drought-inducing monsoon seasons , is expected to be above average this year.

La Niña events have previously seen a drop in global average temperatures, which will be welcome news after the recent heatwaves that have struck the region.

However, it's not all positive.

""La Niña increases the risk of intense storms and tropical cyclones for Australia's east coast,"" says Dr Agus Santoso, a senior scientist at the University of New South Wales.

""While La Nina brings more rain which is good for farming, there are concerns. Flood mitigation measures should be in place.""

What about the other side of the Pacific?

Western South America will probably see drier than normal conditions, with the potential for drought in Peru and Chile.

In the U.S., La Niña is likely to bring drier than normal conditions in the Southwest, as well as the Rockies and Southern Plains. Enhanced rainfall normally arrives in the Pacific Northwest and to a lesser extent over the Ohio Valley, as well as below normal temperatures.

JUST WATCHED Hurricanes: What you don't know Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hurricanes: What you don't know 01:26

But perhaps the most impactful characteristic of La Niña in North America is the role it can play in the hurricane seasons. The Atlantic hurricane season generally sees an increase in the number of hurricanes and tropical storms due to weaker wind shear, which can inhibit tropical systems from forming.

Over the past decade there have been seven hurricanes or tropical storms that caused at least one billion dollars of damage in the U.S.

What exactly is La Niña?

La Niña is the cool phase of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate pattern -- a naturally occurring phenomenon that involves fluctuating ocean temperatures in the Pacific.

La Niña is the opposite of El Niño, which is the warm phase of the cycle.

El Niño is characterized by a warming of the waters in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. La Niña features a cooling of those same Pacific waters.

A La Niña setup begins when strong, easterly winds blow the top-most, warmer layer of water towards Australia and Indonesia, leaving the central-eastern Pacific Ocean as much as four degrees below average.

Experts say that sea surface temperatures have dropped and been neutral since mid-May , which has signaled the demise of El Niño.

Climate models suggest the Pacific will continue to cool, and according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), there is a 75% chance of a La Niña forming by the end of this year.

What happened during the last one?

The most recent La Niña weather pattern began in mid-2010 and continued until 2012.

In 2011, Thailand was hammered by three times its average rainfall.

Recent research has shown that natural fluctuations in the Pacific Ocean played an important role in this surface warming “slowdown”.

But a new paper, published in Nature Climate Change, suggests these variations in the Pacific Ocean were actually triggered by changing aerosol emissions from human activity – particularly by increases in China’s burning of fossil fuels.

The findings suggest that the slowdown in surface warming could have been predicted, the lead author tells Carbon Brief, and that future cuts to aerosol emissions could prompt rapid warming in the coming years.

Cooling effect

In its latest report, the IPCC calculated (pdf) that global surface temperatures between 1998 and 2012 rose by 0.05C per decade. Accounting for uncertainty, this is 30-50% slower than the 0.12C per decade increase over the longer period of 1951-2012.

This apparent slowdown in surface warming has prompted a flurry of research papers as scientists seek to identify its cause.

<a href=’http://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-2015-became-the-hottest-year-on-record’><img alt=’Global surface temperature anomaly ‘ src=’https://public.tableau.com/static/images/Gl/Globalsurfacetemperatureanomaly/Globalsurfacetemperatureanomaly/1_rss.png’ style=’border: none’ /></a>

The overall conclusion from published research suggests there is no single reason for the slowdown, but rather a series of contributing factors. One of the principal causes is thought to be fluctuations in the Pacific Ocean.

These fluctuations are usually known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The PDO has two opposite phases: positive (also known as the “warm” phase) and negative (“cool”), which each affect global weather in different ways.

The phases of the PDO also affect the strength of the trade winds that blow east-to-west across the tropical Pacific Ocean. These winds are driven by warm air rising along the equator and the rotation of the Earth.

During a negative PDO phase, the trade winds strengthen, driving heat into the deep Pacific Ocean, which brings cooler water to the surface. This has a cooling effect on global surface temperatures, as has been seen during the recent slowdown.

It’s worth noting here that the slowdown relates only to the temperature at the Earth’s surface. Looking at all the components of the climate system – including, for example, the deep ocean – scientists have no doubt that the planet as a whole has continued to warm up during the slowdown.

Weaker winds during a positive PDO have the opposite effect, transferring heat from the oceans to the atmosphere and causing surface temperatures to rise more quickly.

The chart below shows how the PDO has fluctuated since 1970; months where the PDO is positive are shown as red bars, while negative months are blue. You can see how the PDO has been predominantly negative since the late nineties, before turning positive again in 2014.

The prevailing theory amongst scientists is that the extended negative phase of the PDO is just part of its natural cycle.

But this might not be the case, says the new paper’s lead author Dr Doug Smith, who heads up the decadal climate prediction research and development at the Met Office Hadley Centre. He tells Carbon Brief:

“Although the PDO can vary naturally, our results show that changes in anthropogenic aerosol emissions could be largely responsible for the negative phase.”

Changing aerosol emissions

Aerosols are tiny particles and droplets floating around in our atmosphere. There are natural sources of aerosols, such as volcanic eruptions and chemicals released by tiny sea creatures, but humans also churn them out via vehicle exhausts and burning fossil fuels and wood.

Aerosols tend to have a cooling effect on the Earth’s climate, by scattering incoming sunlight and by stimulating clouds to form, preventing the Sun’s energy reaching Earth’s surface.

But these particles have also affected the phases of the PDO, the new study says. This impact stems from recent increases in aerosol emissions from China, and decreases in the US and Europe.

In the map below, you can see how the concentration of aerosols in the atmosphere changed over the period of the slowdown. The red and orange areas show the upturn in aerosols, predominantly over China. In contrast, the blue shading show the reduction over Europe and eastern US.

The changing concentration of aerosols in the atmosphere caused local cooling over China and warming over Europe, North America, and, hence, the North Atlantic, Smith says. This had the knock-on effect of strengthening the Pacific trade winds, prompting an extended negative phase of the PDO, and the slowdown in surface temperature rise.

Using climate models, the researchers found they could recreate the negative PDO – and the surface warming slowdown – by simulating these changes in human aerosol emissions.

Natural emissions of aerosols also had a small role in the slowdown, the paper notes, as the Earth was still feeling a residual cooling effect from the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991.

Predictions

Being able to recreate the impact of aerosol emissions on the PDO in climate models suggests that scientists could, in theory, have foreseen the warming slowdown, says Smith:

“Our results suggests that the warming slowdown could have been predicted – assuming changes in aerosol emissions could have been anticipated.”

The findings also suggest that changing emissions of human-caused aerosols will continue to have an impact on surface warming over the coming years, says Smith:

“Future reductions in aerosol emissions from China – to improve air quality – could promote a positive phase of the PDO and a period of increased trends in global surface temperatures. There are some signs that this could be happening.”

Bridging the gap

The paper is a real advance in scientists’ understanding of how the climate varies from one decade to the next, says Prof Piers Forster, a professor of physical climate change at the University of Leeds, who wasn’t involved in the study. He tells Carbon Brief:

“Researchers have typically split climate response into two parts – the ‘forced’ response due to greenhouse gases, aerosols or volcanic eruptions, and ‘internal variability’ – patterns of change, such as the El Niño, caused by the more or less random swilling around of the ocean and atmosphere.”

“The really nice thing about the paper is that it makes the first steps in bridging the gap, examining how aerosol and volcanic forcing drive patterns of variability.”

However, these are the findings of just one scientific paper, so further work will be needed to confirm the connection between aerosols and the negative PDO, says Prof Jerry Meehl, from the National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Colorado, who also wasn’t involved in the research.

Large changes in aerosol emissions have happened in the past without affecting Pacific Ocean fluctuations, notes Meehl. So it may be that aerosol emissions strengthened a naturally-occurring negative phase of the PDO, rather than causing it, he says.

In addition, recent research by Meehl suggests that different phases of the PDO could be triggered by El Niño events – such as the switch to a positive PDO that coincided with the recent strong El Niño event. Meehl’s study also suggests that global surface warming may accelerate over the next few years.

Human-caused aerosols are, therefore, at least another factor to add to the list of those that have contributed to the global surface warming slowdown, Meehl tells Carbon Brief:

“My takeaway from this paper is we may add another possible factor to the list of processes that have been identified as contributing to the early-2000s slowdown, and all likely played a role: internal [Pacific Ocean] variability, a succession of moderate-sized volcanic eruptions, an extended solar minimum around 2012, stratospheric water vapor, and now anthropogenic aerosols.”

75,75,FL-2016-000064-CHN,Why Koreans Eat Boiling-Hot Soup on the Most Sweltering Days of Summer - Munchies_ Food by VICE,https://www.vice.com/en/article/z48wd5/why-koreans-eat-boiling-hot-soup-on-the-most-sweltering-days-of-summer,"But rather than lining up at the popsicle shop to deal with it, Koreans prefer something else: a steaming hot bowl of chicken and ginseng soup known as samgyetang.

Oppressive heat and humidity, often combined with monsoon rains and soaring smog levels, make summer an excretory season in Korea. A normally surly people become even surlier, and thanks to energy-saving directives from the government, even going inside for air-conditioning is no guarantee of cooling off.

""In Korea, they say 'fight fire with fire!'"" declares Choi Mi-hee, owner of Gangwon Toon Samgyetang in Ilsan, just north of Seoul. ""[Samgyetang] has benefits [in the summer] because when it's too hot, we eat cold things. Our stomach gets colder but the rest of us stays hot. So we have to make it the same temperature.""

""Korea has a lot of foods that are traditionally eaten on certain days,"" says restaurateur, Korean food expert, and ZenKimchi blogger Joe McPherson. In this case, ""it's believed that eating a medicinal soup will replenish the nutrients lost from sweating during the hottest days of summer.""

Following that logic, on the three traditionally hottest days of the summer—chobok, jungbok, and malbok, according to the lunar calendar—locals storm the samgyetang restaurants of Korea to gobble down fat bowls of the stuff, supplemented with either ginseng liquor or bottles of soju.

Like most Korean soups, it's served in the same bowl it's cooked in, a stone dol-sot bowl, which means it's still at a rolling boil when it comes to the table. There are two ways to eat it—either pick out the bones and eat them one by one, dipping them in salt; or debone the entire thing, mix it in with the rice, and eat it like a porridge or congee.

Samgyetang is cooked with a young chicken, usually slaughtered at a month old, small enough to fit into a bowl and still very tender. The chicken is stuffed with glutinous rice, and cooked with ginseng, jujube, milk vetch root, chestnut, and garlic, plus whatever else the chef might have secreted away. Choi says she uses eight other secret ingredients, but insists they're all natural and salubrious.

The history of the meal goes back to Korea's days as an agrarian backwater, when there wasn't much to eat, and what there was wasn't great. ""During the summer, you needed to have food that was full of protein and had a lot of calories,"" says Daniel Gray, restaurateur and blogger at Seoul Eats , a popular Korean food blog.

""You didn't usually have a lot of meat during that time,"" Gray says. ""You couldn't butcher a cow [in the summer], because everything would spoil. You couldn't afford to have your cows be food instead of working your fields. A pig would be the same thing, so you had to have smaller kinds of animals: duck, dog, chicken, eel, those sorts of things. And by eating that and having protein in your body, you'd be able to work a little bit more.""

Gray says that chicken was traditionally considered a non-nutritious meat, below beef, seafood, and pork. So the ginseng and other herbs were brewed in it to give it a nutritious kick.

""I think that's one of the really great things about a lot of the Korean food culture and food history—people are very in-tune with their bodies,"" Gray says. ""And so if you were working every day in the hot fields, and then you eat something that has a lot of nutrition, you would definitely feel it the next day.""","Fri, 24 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://munchies-images.vice.com/wp_upload/Vice-Samgyetang-13.jpg?image-resize-opts=Y3JvcD0xeHc6MC44NDM3NXhoO2NlbnRlcixjZW50ZXImcmVzaXplPTEyMDA6KiZyZXNpemU9MTIwMDoq,"['sweltering', 'soup', 'food', 'eat', 'days', 'hot', 'korean', 'lot', 'bowl', 'summer', 'chicken', 'koreans', 'ginseng', 'boilinghot']",

77,77,FL-2016-000064-CHN,How to gamble with flood - Ceylon Daily News,https://www.dailynews.lk/?q=2016/06/14/features/84559,"In ancient cultures flooding was perceived as blessing in disguise because it was the main transportation method of fertilizers free of charge for agriculture activities in temporary submergence areas called flood plains. After moving people into flood plains because of shortage of space for settlement, flood phenomena transforms to a curse for human. Deciding to settle down in flood prone area is a gamble. However there are modern technologies available to win in this gamble.

For example, it is now possible to simulate different flood conditions arise due to heavy rains on a computer screen before it actually occurs using satellite and survey data. This is called “flood modeling” in engineering. It is same as modeling in cloth industry where the user becomes aware of how he or she looks without actually wearing it. Similarly any area subject to floods can be modeled and divide in to zones so that land user will know how his lands get submerged or perform for different levels of flood situations. This type of performance based methods evaluates how an existing or newly introduced flood mitigation effort performs under different flood conditions.

Flooding during heavy rains and water pollution during normal time in natural streams is a common problem all over the world when human settlements are located near flood prone areas. For example about 7-10% land area of the US under human settlements are subjected to flooding.

Hidden reasons for frequent flooding

• Increased upland development by clearing tree cover resulting in impervious areas (Roofs, metaled roads etc.) that increase the runoff rate causing flash floods (Attanagalu Oya Basin)

• Obstruction in natural stream and flow ways due to poor maintenance (very common along Kelani River basin)

• Encroachment into flood zones (filling of wetlands for development. Ex; Gampaha, Jaela, Wattala)

• Deposition of sediments in flood outlets due to erosion of stream banks because of encroaching stream reservations either for agriculture in rural areas or for settlement in urban areas

• Inadequate flow capacity in streams due to invasive type weed growth associated with polluted water. (Wattala, Kalmunai)

How community to get ready to face above challenges

People who are already settled and people who are planning to settle in flood prone areas subjected to above issues could be kept aware of the different risk levels inherent to the place where they are currently settled or intend to settle. For that there is a need to do an exercise called Flood Hazard Zoning. This approach is very common in developed world. This exercise will also enhance the community participation for government intervention such as canal cleaning and discouraging further encroachment into flood plains by land fillings.

Available technologies

With flood zoning, flood insurance becomes an option that adds a financial component in designing buildings to address those future risks. For example people can build their houses at elevated levels on columns to suit predicted flood levels. Also the sewerage systems can be introduced to suit the wetland environments.

Opposite of flood

Wetlands of flood plain are the interface between aquatic and terrestrial areas. Plants in those wetlands play very vital role in cleaning water biologically before it falls into the main streams. Wetlands are in fact the kidneys of our nature. With the time, because of so-called development, the environmental features of flood plains have been changed vastly causing not only floods during heavy rains but also malfunctioning natural water cleaning process especially during droughts. Riparian trees along stream banks also have been disturbed.

In developed countries those stream banks are improved as walking/cycle tracks after establishing tree cover along the bank and as a side benefit use as Environmental Sustainable Transport (EST) in urban areas.

Note that those new technologies address not only flood situation but also suggests methods to face drought situations too by identifying areas suitable for temporary water storages within flood plains. For example during previous drought situation before this flood, there was a water shortage under Attanagalu Oya Basin though annually it dumps water into sea equivalent to a volume of Parakrama Samudraya. Severe drought situations, is a big issue worse than a flood especially in view of the current pollution levels of our natural streams. Modern technologies also could be used to identify naturally available water cleaning wetlands to be preserved.

King Parakramabahu's famous quote on water conservation and utilization “Do not release even a drop of rain water to the sea without using” applies not only to Dry Zone but for the Wet Zone too.","Tue, 14 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.dailynews.lk/sites/default/files/styles/node-detail/public/news/2016/06/13/z_p05-how.jpg?itok=VZCsUrLH,"['water', 'levels', 'areas', 'plains', 'natural', 'example', 'streams', 'stream', 'wetlands', 'flood', 'gamble']", 
78,78,FL-2016-000064-CHN,The Era of Cheap Oil Is Coming to an End - Foreign Policy,https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/14/the-era-of-cheap-oil-is-coming-to-an-end/,"The Era of Cheap Oil Is Coming to an End

In the past two years, a flood of crude has pushed down oil prices, battering corporate balance sheets and wreaking havoc with budgets in oil-dependent countries from Russia to Iraq.

That’s beginning to change thanks to the double whammy of rising demand and pinched supplies of oil — especially unplanned outages and disruptions in places like Canada, Nigeria, and Libya. Expect prices to start rising in response.

On Tuesday, the International Energy Agency said it expects the oil market to be balanced for the rest of the year, meaning the world will pump roughly as much oil as it consumes. That should nudge prices higher. Oil is currently trading around $50 a barrel, double the nadir reached earlier this year.

If the oil market is getting closer to a normal balance of supply and demand, it’s no thanks to major producers inside OPEC — especially Saudi Arabia — that have kept pumping with abandon even as prices plummeted.

Rather, the market can thank global disruptions of oil supplies, which in May reached their highest level in five years. The production declines were in large part due to wildfires in Canada that knocked some oil sands production in Alberta offline.

Other oil-producing regions have also been reeling: A new generation of militants in the Niger delta in southern Nigeria are targeting crude production facilities there, while Libya’s continued political disintegration has kept oil production and exports there at a fraction of prewar levels. Other major oil-producing countries, especially Venezuela, face severe economic and political stresses; plenty of energy experts figure Venezuelan exports could tumble sharply later this year.

Altogether, those outages, attacks, and wildfires knocked 3.7 million barrels of oil production a day offline. That helped push oil prices to their yearly high. For the past two years, the world was so awash in oil that the market could afford to shrug off the virtual disappearance of the Libyan oil industry, for example, or watch the return of Nigerian rebels with equanimity. Now, though, outages are set to cause bigger ripples in a tighter market.

“We aren’t yet back to the situation where every potential supply hiccup puts a couple of dollars on the price, but the market is definitely awake to geopolitics again,” said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a consultancy in London.

While the wildfires in Canada, which at their worst took off more than 1 million barrels a day of production, are winding down, disruptions in Nigeria and Libya are likely to be long lasting, the IEA said. And those outages have done what OPEC chose not to do: Close the spigot a bit.

“The spate of disruptions have helped put a more solid floor under crude prices and accelerated the rebalancing in global supply and demand,” said Robert McNally, founder and president of the Rapidan Group, an energy consultancy.

Nigeria is a particular concern because of both the scope of the disruption — vandalism and attacks knocked out close to 1 million barrels per day of production in May — and because the new generation of militants seems unwilling to negotiate with the government as their predecessors did. Mallinson said Nigeria faces the “potential for prolonged disruptions of the type seen in 2006-09,” when militants systematically targeted foreign oil companies and their production in Nigeria.

Those outages by themselves wouldn’t necessarily be cause for concern, or at least they haven’t been for the past two years. But now that demand for oil is also rebounding — that’s particularly true in India as well as in the world’s two-biggest oil consumers, China and the United States — there’s less slack in the system if something goes wrong.

And that’s especially the case given Saudi Arabia’s flat-out oil production policy. The kingdom is still pumping oil at near-record levels, producing 10.2 million barrels a day. That means Saudi Arabia has a lot less ability to “surge” oil production to meet global needs; the more it pumps on a daily basis, the less spare production capacity there is inside OPEC.

And since spare capacity is essentially the shock absorber for the global oil market, the world could soon be in for a very bumpy ride.

“Prices will be jumpier as well, spiking in response to disruptions or the risk of disruptions, given Saudi Arabia’s very low spare production capacity,” McNally said.

The sinkholes are located a mile apart and sit between Wink and Kermit off I-20 west of Midland-Odessa, and could converge into one huge hole, a new study released by researchers at Southern Methodist University found.

""A collapse could be catastrophic,"" said Jin-Woo Kim, in an SMU news release.

One sinkhole, discovered in 1980 is 360 feet across, about the size of a football field, and the other is 670-900 feet across and was found in 2002, Lu said.

Using radar remote sensing, SMU researchers discovered the sinkholes are expanding, one at 13 centimeters a year, and new ones are continuing to form in the area, according to the study.

The study states there is a lot of oil and gas production equipment and installations and hazardous liquid pipelines in the area and when fresh water is injected underground, it ""can dissolve the interbedded salt layers and accelerate the sinkhole collapse.""

Officials have fenced off the area around the sinkholes and they will be monitored, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

Despite the sinkholes growing two inches closer to each other each year, residents are not reportedly not alarmed by their presence.

""They're a ways off from the highway; if nobody mentions it, then nobody is interested in it,"" Kermit City Manager Gloria Saenz told the New York Daily News.

Now, with dozens of competitors biting at its heels, the world’s biggest producer of consumer drones needs to prove that its products are more than just glorified selfie sticks.

“Right now, DJI is the king of the drones-are-cool market, they are not king of the drones-are-a-tool market,” said Colin Snow, founder of Skylogic Research, which advises corporations using drones. “They’ve entered where they don’t have a lot of experience.”

The nine-year-old company is developing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for agriculture and surveying as dozens of competitors inside China and around the world begin to flood the market with cheap drones, from $10 minitoys to sub-$100 camera carriers.

Growth in the consumer drone market is going to plateau in the next year, said Gerald Van Hoy, analyst at technology research firm Gartner Inc.

“There are a number of people who will buy one and they will not use it again,” Van Hoy said. “It is a novelty item for them, then it will go to their attic.”

So Shenzhen-based DJI is pouring money into its development kit, which allows software developers to write their own applications for specific tasks, similar to the way Apple Inc. does for its iPhones.

Up for grabs is a market for aerial mining surveys, pipeline inspection, search and rescue, crop spraying and hundreds of other commercial tasks that’s expected to reach $127 billion by 2020.

“The real question is which of these market opportunities at scale provides incentive for us to build products,” said Darren Liccardo, head of DJI’s Palo-Alto R&D office, which opened last year and has a team of about 20. “Clearly agriculture will definitely be a large market.”

Here is a sample of key targets for commercial drone makers and some of the leading manufacturers.

Agriculture

Farmers were some of the earliest civil adopters, using drones to identify differences in crop conditions. Yamaha Motor Co. has been dusting crops in Japan with UAVs for more than two decades. With the cost dropping for cargo-carrying drones, DJI and others are building crop-spraying and remote sensing vehicles that can help reduce chemical use and improve yields. It has been estimated that precision agriculture will account for about 80 percent of the U.S. market for commercial UAVs.

Last year, the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority issued the first exemption for agricultural drone use outside of university research. DJI released its eight-rotor Agras MG-1 last year, with a 10-kilogram tank, followed by a thermal-imaging camera for remote sensing. It’s up against companies like Yamaha and local rivals like Shenzhen MicroMultiCopter Aero Technology Co.

Imaging

Where the civilian drone boom began. Companies are now using the devices for everything from filming Bollywood weddings, to inspecting remote or hard-to-reach places, like oil rigs.

More than 5,000 exemptions have been granted by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, many of them for some form of photography or surveying. Between September 2014 and January, almost 2,000 were filed for real-estate firms to take images of sprawling properties or show the view from an apartment tower that’s yet to be built.

“If you look at a large utility company, they’re spending $40 million a year for helicopter service,” said Jonathan Evans, chief executive officer of Skyward, a producer of flight-planning software for companies including those that inspect phone towers. “If you move the needle just a little bit, it has serious returns on the bottom line for the company.”

The majority of the U.S. exemptions were for DJI drones and from companies with less than 10 workers. Major competitors in aerial imagery are Paris-based Parrot SA, which acquired Sensefly to expand into commercial quadcopters, and 3D Robotics Inc. in Berkeley, California. Startups making waves in the sector include Yuneec Electric Aviation and Ehang Inc.’s UAVs.

Delivery

Leading the media fuss is the question of when we’ll get packages to drop out of the air. DJI says that for now it’s not pursuing delivery drones, though its agricultural model could be adapted to do so.

For retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which are all testing drones for deliveries, the UAV promises to solve the “last mile” problem — the costliest leg of a package’s journey to the customer’s door.

“You break down the economics of supply chain management and you realize why Amazon’s going after this,” Skyward’s Evans said. “They can make a lot of money here.”

Regulatory hurdles will likely mean commercial operation is years away — most countries ban drones from flying out of the operator’s line of sight or over crowded areas. Meanwhile, they are being used in remote areas to send and collect medical supplies and tests.

The Rwandan government partnered with San Francisco-based Zipline to fly blood bags at 100 kph to remote hospitals. Other to watch are Matternet in Menlo Park, California, and startup Flirtey, which said it made the first FAA-approved urban drone delivery of an emergency kit in the U.S. this year.

Racing

Still mostly a hobby sport, drone racers have big plans for the sport, with commercial leagues to rival Nascar or Formula 1. Think Star Wars pod racing without the pilots.

At the Dubai World Drone Prix back in March, 15-year-old Luke Bannister from the U.K. won the $250,000 top prize with a custom device built on U.K.-based KC Frames’ platform. Producers of ready-made speed demons include Arrishobby.com, Horizon Hobby LLC, Walkera Technology Co., and Shenzhen Hubsan Intelligent Co.

Transport

And then there’s the dream of anyone who’s ever been stuck in a traffic jam: the passenger drone.

Ehang, based in Guangzhou, China, grabbed the limelight at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show in January with its Ehang 184, a 440-pound (200 kg) personal flyer controlled by a smartphone that can whisk someone 500 meters above the traffic.

The oversized, white quadcopter has an air-conditioned cabin with a reading light. Ehang says it has successfully flown the aircraft in rural areas with a company engineer inside, but a commercial version is at least five years away.

Even then, regulations and air safety fears mean that it’s likely to be a lot longer than that before we can catch up with James Bond, whose gadgets in “You Only Live Twice” included the rocket-armed Little Nellie personal helicopter.

“We will eventually get to that point where passengers feel enough safety in the system to trust it. For now, I don’t think that exists,” said Brent Terwilliger, program chair of unmanned systems at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. “We’re going to need to see autonomous vehicles on the road. Once we see those operating reliably, safely, efficiently, then we can add a new axis.”

Meanwhile, Ehang Co-founder Derrick Xiong said the company is looking into using the drone for search and rescue or tourist flights.

Is the state ready for the heavy downpour?

Business & Politics News - India & You

Criss-crossed by several rivers, including the mighty Ganges, West Bengal has traditionally been vulnerable to heavy floods each year. With the Monsoon knocking its door, is the state better prepared this year?

After two years of deficient rains, the India Meteorological Department (Met) has forecast that this year the monsoons would be higher than usual, about 106 of the average. The news was bound to bring cheer to hundreds of millions of farmers around the country whose crops have been ruined for two years running due to scanty or untimely rains. Yet, there would be some trepidation as well, especially in states that are particularly vulnerable to heavy floods even during a year with average rains.

West Bengal is one such state, which has floods even when rest of the country cries out for rains as it happened in 2015 when despite a 14 pc deficit in rains, severe floods in 12 districts of West Bengal affected around 3.7 million people.

West Bengal has 37,660 sq. km flood prone area while the total geographical area of the state is 88,752 sq. km. The flood problems of the state are different in different regions. Along with the Ganges, the rivers Teesta, Torsa, Jaldhaka and Raidak flow through the districts of Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar. They originate either in the neighbouring country of Bhutan or the state of Sikkim and flows down to West Bengal before reaching Bangladesh. While in some places excessive monsoons bring serious flash floods, dam breaks have also caused catastrophic flooding in Bengal. Neutralising flood risks have always been a daunting task for the government in the history, will it deliver this year?

Barely a month after Mamata Banerjee took oath as the Chief Minister for the second time, after having scored a thumping win in the elections; the Met forecasts spread panic in the closed door meetings of the new government. The West Bengal state government alarmed by the onset of monsoon is planning measures to limit floods and its consequent annihilation.

The government formed two dedicated flood control rooms — one in North Bengal and another in the south and two senior officials have been posted at the DVC (Damodar Valley Corporation) headquarters to monitor the situation. The control rooms would ensure that the government is forewarned on the release of water from the dams. Moreover, the top state bureaucrats will be meeting every day at Nabanna (the state secretariat of West Bengal) and monitor the government’s response to heavy monsoons this year.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee blamed DVC for floods in some parts of the state last year. The government had alleged that sudden release of water from DVC dams without proper intimation had caused loss of lives and livestock. However, the Damodar Valley Corporation, this year has assured West Bengal government of support and better co-ordination with regard to release of water from its dams as in heavy monsoon situations which are likely to trigger floods.

Other measures

Apart from these measures, the irrigation department has identified 145 kilometres of vulnerable river embankments and dams. While the restoration work has already begun, the government is also keeping a close watch on the other river banks especially in the rural areas.

According to sources, the state government is also discussing disaster measures with national and international NGOs such as the Red Cross Society, Bharat Sevashram and St John Ambulance services. The disaster management department has reportedly dispatched teams and relief materials to the flood-prone districts of the state. However, speculations are still lingering about political prejudice and foul play with regard to distribution of flood relief in remote areas.","Fri, 17 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://mediaindia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Floods-Bengal.jpg,"['water', 'floods', 'india', 'west', 'group', 'heavy', 'bengal', 'dams', 'vulnerable', 'rains', 'flood', 'media', 'state']",

New Delhi: China is proving to be the biggest stumbling block as far as India’s bid for getting entry into Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is concerned.

In fact, the Chinese have been very vocal in their opposition to India’s entry into NSG.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, did not let the controversy come in the way of extending birthday greetings to the Chinese President Xi Jinping on his 63rd birthday today.

PM Modi extended birthday wishes to President Xi Jinping on Twitter-like Chinese Weibo account.

Modi wished Xi Xinping a long life and good health. The response of Xi Xinping is not known as of now.

Modi’s birthday wish to Xi Xinping has generated huge goodwill in China. His post had been shared more than 5,100 times and attracted 7,200 “likes” within hours.

It should be recalled that Twitter has been blocked in China since 2009 due to its tough censor laws.

A Chinese delegation representing the CEFC China Energy met Georgia’s Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili and other officials in capital Tbilisi this afternoon, where they learned about the prospects of cooperation in several sectors including energy, finances, tourism, transport and logistics.

Georgia’s Prime Minister informed the guests about the vast investment opportunities available in Georgia and said a special working group would be created to facilitate cooperation between the Government of Georgia and CEFC China Energy.

The working group will be chaired by Georgia’s Minister of Economy Dimitri Kumsishvili.

Meanwhile in July the Chinese company will host a month-long investment forum in Shanghai, China, and invited Georgia to attend so the sides could further discuss future cooperation.

CEFC China Energy is a private Chinese conglomerate. With revenue of $35 billion USD in 2014, the company is among the 10 largest private companies in China.

In 2014 CEFC China Energy earned most of its income from oil and gas (60 percent) and financial services (25 percent), but the company also operated in a wide range of other sectors like transport infrastructure, forestry, asset management, hotel management, warehousing services, real estate development and logistics services.

A large portion of CEFC's assets is concentrated in overseas markets. Most of the company is owned by Shanghai Energy Fund Investment Ltd (SEFI), which is registered under Ye Jianming, the chairman of CEFC.

Amazing images show hundreds of people in China taking part in Yoga on a transparent glass platform suspended 1,300 feet high.

Around 150 yoga enthusiasts took part in the terrifying group performance at the Jingdong Stone Forest Gorge scenic spot in Beijing,China, on June 20, reports the People's Daily Online.

International Yoga day falls on June 21 and is celebrated with yoga classes and group performances across the globe.

The inaugural International Yoga Day was celebrated last year on June 21 with enthusiasts in countries such as Malaysia, Australia and Thailand holding performances and classes.

The breath-taking observation deck opened to the public on May 1 and has quickly drawn attention of daredevil tourists.

Chinese media have claimed that the attraction is the largest glass-bottomed viewing platform in the world.

The platform is 4,470 square feet in size as it protrudes more than 107 feet over the edge of the cliff face it's set against.

In comparison, the glass-bottomed observation deck at the Grand Canyon in the USA is 70 feet long.

The enormous structure is composed of a glass-bottomed walkway leading to a circular viewing platform.

An aerial video released by China Central Television Station, shows how the platform is hung over a rocky cliff with lush mountains ranging as far as eyes can see in the background.

Though some tourists struggled to walk on the platform, others couldn't get enough of the fun as they snoozed on the transparent floor or took selfies against the vertical rock face underneath.

One man, who did push-ups on the platform, told the reporter: 'When I first got up here, it was really quite scary.'

He added: 'I feel nervous and excited at the same time.'

Another female visitor said: 'I hope China will bring in more things like this because young people are really stressed out at work, they can use this to relax.'

According to reports, the Pinggu glass-bottomed platform is claiming three different world records.

The first is that it's the world's longest platform that protrudes over the edge of a cliff at 107 feet.

It's also claiming to be the world's largest glass platform as its circular surface area measures 4,467 square feet.

Finally, it's reportedly the first time that titanium used in the aviation industry has been used in the construction of a 'building'.

A spokesman for the site told People's Daily: 'Using titanium for this project is our way of making sure that maximum efforts have been put in to ensure the safety of tourists.'

The titanium material used is said to be light, durable and resistant to erosion.

Jingdong Stone Forest Gorge scenic area is a popular tourist area just over 43 miles from downtown Beijing and visitors flock to the site to see its enormous stone formations.

While the thought of standing on a glass bridge over a valley is challenging to most people, Chinese tourists clearly enjoy the idea - a lot.

The Zhangjiajie Grand Canyon in southern China is currently waiting to open a 1,410-foot-long see-through walkway connecting two mountains.

The £48 million project is built over a 980-foot-high valley and will also have a bungee platform and a giant swing.

Billed as the world's longest and highest glass-bottomed bridge, the attraction is expected to open in July.

According to a letter from Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, Mateen searched for the terms “Pulse Orlando” and “Shooting” while the attack was still going on.

In addition, he reportedly posted messages on his Facebook page while he was carrying out the deadliest mass shooting in American history.

“The real muslims will never accept the filthy ways of the west,” Mateen wrote on one of at least five Facebook accounts believed to be associated with him, according to the letter.

Mateen made several additional Facebook posts both before and during his attack. The final post allegedly read, “”In the next few days you will see attacks from the Islamic state in the usa.”

The Senate committee has asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for help uncovering the messages and clues that Mateen left behind in cyberspace.

A person familiar with the situation who is not authorized to speak publicly told the AP that the Facebook posts came moments before the attack began. Mateen went on to kill 49 people and injure another 53 people.

“America and Russia stop bombing the Islamic state,” Mateen reportedly wrote. “In the next few days you will see attacks from the Islamic state in the USA.”

Mateen was killed by police during a shootout after a lengthy standoff with police.

(The researchers focused on China because many Chinese, especially in the poorer rural areas, eat very little fruit compared to folks in more affluent areas. When fruit is introduced into their diet the health improvements are more easily seen.) According to the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, low fruit consumption is one of the leading causes of premature death (before age 70) in China.

Clearly, eating fruit daily is essential for overall health. It not only provides your body with fluids and energy, fruits like apples and oranges also dish up phytochemicals, antioxidants and fiber that boost your immune system and lower blood pressure and blood glucose levels.

So make sure you get at least two servings every day; we think four is even better. That's a cup of mixed berries or cut up melon, an orange, an apple and a hearty handful of fresh grapes.

Life after a heart attack

After a heart attack in 1996, Dodgers' manager Tommy Lasorda retired from baseball. That was 20 years ago. Today, the Hall of Fame manager is almost 90.

A cardiologist familiar with Lasorda has said that the keys to a long and productive life following a heart attack (Lasorda had another ""minor"" one in 2012) are medications to control blood cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes, as well as low-dose aspirin. And then, of course, there's adopting a healthy lifestyle.

Besides sticking with a diet low in saturated fat, there's evidence that if you have cardiovascular disease, appropriate exercise makes your heart and blood vessels much healthier. Researchers at Shanghai University of Sport in China reviewed 35 studies that included some 2,250 participants from 10 countries. They found that among those with heart disease, Chinese exercise, such as tai chi or qi gong, helped reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure and significantly helped reduce lousy LDL cholesterol levels too. The researchers also say that Chinese exercise improves quality of life and reduces depression for folks with CVD.

We've always promoted walking 10,000 steps a day, along with a nutritious diet, for a healthy cardiovascular system. And, as the Shanghai study has shown, aerobic exercise delivers additional benefits. Thirty minutes of light tai chi equals 2,000 steps, and it's a great place to start on your way to getting in 10,000 steps daily.

You can do it. As coach Lasorda always said: ""The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination.""

The power of veggies

Q: I read that vegetable oils are bad for your heart and that even if they lower your cholesterol, you will die sooner than if you ate saturated fats. Is the whole ""vegetables are good for you"" thing a myth?

Charles O., Lafayette, Indiana

A: Nutritional science has shown us, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that veggies are nature's gift; they're loaded with phytochemicals that our brain, some organ systems and all of our cells need to thrive. So no wonder it's confusing when headlines recently declared that vegetable oils could kill you!

That news was generated because of a new study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health who did a deep dive into data collected by the 1968 to 1973 Minnesota Coronary Experiment. What they found was that even though study participants - in a nursing home and six state mental institutions - who ate fats from vegetable oils (primarily linoleic acid from corn oil and corn oil polyunsaturated margarine) lowered their cholesterol by around 14 percent, they didn't have lower rates of heart attack, and often died sooner than folks in the study control group, who ate a diet high in saturated fat from animal fats, common margarines and shortenings.

But the study doesn't tell us whether the folks on the veg-oil diet plan ate heart-destroying trans fats (made from hydrogenated vegetable oils) in baked goods and margarines. And we know they reduced their artery-clogging sat fat intake only 50 percent, while increasing linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) intake 280 percent. Too much omega-6 (and too little omega-3) in this analysis of 50-year-old data seems to be associated with bodywide inflammation and heart woes.

So what's the bottom line?

Eat five to nine servings of veggies and fruits and two servings of 100 percent whole grains daily; no trans fats; no red or processed meats; and choose lean proteins like walnuts, skinless poultry and salmon, ocean trout, sardines or anchovies, which are rich in omega-3s. And stick with olive, canola and safflower oil; they're lowest in omega-6.

93,93,FL-2016-000064-CHN,Chinese Archaeologists May Have Solved the Mystery of the Lost Palace of Kublai Khan - Ancient Origins,https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/chinese-archaeologists-may-have-solved-mystery-lost-palace-kublai-khan-020861,"Last month, archaeologists found a hint of an amazing discovery while excavating in the Forbidden City in China. While the researchers were somewhat hesitant then to confirm the finding of Kublai Khan’s imperial palace, they now have further evidence supporting the idea that they have found the famous lost domain of the powerful ruler.

According to Marco Polo, Kublai Khan’s palace was “the greatest palace that ever was.” In his travel journal he wrote, “The palace was made of cane supported by 200 silk cords, which could be taken to pieces and transported easily when the emperor moved.” The walls were described on South China Morning Post (SCMP) as “covered with gold and silver and the main hall was so large that it could easily seat 6,000 people for dinner.”

Kublai Khan was one of China’s most famous rulers and he has been regarded by many to have been a wise ruler as well. He was the grandson of Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol Empire. In his own right, Kublai Khan is remembered for having established the Yuan Dynasty. Although, this emperor has held an important place in history, the South China Morning Post reports that his palace’s location has been an ongoing mystery.

That mystery may be closer to a conclusion thanks to the team excavating in Beijing’s Forbidden City. The researchers from the Palace museum’s Institute of Archaeology’s main proof comes in the form of a “3 meter [9.84 ft.] thick rammed earth and rubble foundation buried beneath the layers of Ming and Qing dynasty construction.” (Via South China Morning Post) This size of this feature was apparently strange for a Yuan building, but “it could have been used to support a palatial hall.”

The institute deputy director Wang Guangyao told the South China Morning Post that the foundation discovered at the palace is similar to one that was found in the ruins of Zhongdu – “one of the four capitals of the Yuan dynasty.” Furthermore, the director noted that some of the debris in the Yuan foundation dates back to older dynasties, such as the Liao (907–1125) and Jin (1115–1234).

The Yuan foundation has rubble that dates to earlier dynasties. ( Simon Song )

Nonetheless, Wang Guangyao remains cautious about the discovery of the foundation and said “From a historical perspective, it gives us evidence that the architectural history runs uninterrupted from the Yuan, to the Ming and Qing dynasties […] as archaeologists, we can only define what we have found, but it gives us a direction for future exploration.”

As Ancient Origins reported in May, there will be no large-scale excavations accompanying this discovery. Wang said: “Even if we think a certain site is important for an archaeological finding, we can’t just dig the ground up because it is not allowed. All we can do is to wait and collect as much evidence as we can until sometime later, probably in a generation or two, work is done in those places and we can put all the finds together to see if they are all connected.”

There are, however, plans to make the new discovery visible to visitors to the Forbidden City in the near future.

State Security Minister Kembo Mohadi has donated food and non food items worth 5 000 Euros to 138 people who were affected by flash floods near Dulibadzimu Bus Terminus here in March.

The donations which comprised maize meal, beans, cooking oil, buckets, salt, textbooks for schoolchildren were sourced from the Lutheran Development Services (LDS) by the minister who is also the local parliamentarian for Beitbridge East Constituency.

“We appealed to everyone during the greatest hour of need and we are very grateful to LDS for such a gesture. This might have come up late but its better late than never.

“As Government we have made it clear since time immemorial that we will assist and stick with our people at all times in all kinds of disasters. We will go out of our way to help them,” He said.

The minister said during the floods most families were left distressed and they lost valuables including movable property. He said in the case of school children they lost text and exercise books among other things which were swept away.

Minister Mohadi said it was important for businesses and Government to work together in addressing the many challenges affecting the people.

Speaking during the same event LDS board member Lekgang Sijiye said the humanitarian support came through the Diakone Emergency Aid who also donated to the Mawale (Beitbridge East) flood victims in the 2012/2013 rainy season.

“We have notable experience in responding to emergencies and have successfully implemented food relief and cholera intervention programmes support by various funders.

“We also acknowledge the participation of the Rural District Development Committee members who put a lot of effort in the organisation and registration of the people whom we were finally able to reach,” he said.

Beitbridge town secretary, Loud Ramakgapola said the local authority needed a total of $112 000 to attend to the drainage system in the areas affected by floods.

He said a total of 76 houses with 259 families were affected by heavy rains near Dulibadzimu bus terminus.","Tue, 21 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/05/MOHADI.jpg,"['donates', 'lds', 'beitbridge', 'food', 'near', 'terminus', 'minister', 'victims', 'affected', 'support', 'flood', 'mohadi', 'total']",
