Bangladesh and India are mounting a major rescue effort for a wild elephant struggling to survive after it was separated from its herd by floods and then washed across the border.

On Thursday three Indian forest officials will travel to a flood-hit area in northern Bangladesh to investigate how they can help the stranded animal, which was separated from its herd in northeast India more than a month ago.

A vet dispatched to the scene by Bangladesh authorities said the elephant, a female that weighs an estimated four tonnes, was ""weak and tired"" after its solo odyssey across the Brahmaputra river that separates the two countries.

""For the last month it has been separated from its herd and stranded mostly in flood water,"" Sayed Hossain told AFP.

""It crossed the mighty Brahmaputra and has been living mostly on paddy (rice) crop, sugar canes and a limited amount of banana plants.""

Forestry official Shahab Uddin said thousands of villagers in boats have been following the elephant, which has so far crossed around 100 kilometres (60 miles) of flooded terrain in northern Bangladesh.

Bangladeshi authorities have dispatched a team of forest rangers, police inspectors and vets to track the wild animal, but the floods were hampering rescue efforts.

""Our effort to rescue the animal has been hampered by ongoing floods as there is no way we can tranquillise it in water as it might be floated downstream. The elephant must be driven to a higher ground in a bid to rescue it,"" Uddin said.

""After seeing her latest conditions, both teams will decide how we can rescue her,"" he added.

Uddin said the hundreds of villagers who were flocking to see the elephant were also likely hampering her ability to seek higher ground unaffected by the floods.

The wild elephants of India and Bangladesh have dwindled in number in recent decades as their habitat is destroyed.

The rescue bid comes days after Indian wildlife officers appealed for help in caring for eight rhino calves pulled from the floodwaters in the northeastern state of Assam.

Scores of people die every year from flooding and landslides during the monsoon rains in India and neighbouring Nepal and Bangladesh.

So far this year 96 people have died in the worst-hit Indian states of Assam and Bihar.

Huge crowds of villagers following a wild elephant stranded in Bangladesh for more than a month by floods are hampering efforts to rescue it, forest officials said Saturday.

Severe floods in the northeastern Indian state of Assam separated the four-ton female elephant from its herd as strong currents in the Brahmaputra river washed it across the border to northern Bangladesh late June.

This week Indian wildlife officials travelled to Bangladesh to join local forest rangers and vets to rescue the animal, which is now struggling to stand on its feet after a journey of more than 100 kilometres (60 miles).

""It's now standing in a five-feet flood water in Jamalpur district. It is extremely weak. There are more than 10,000 people watching her from a close distance,"" Bangladeshi vet Sayed Hossain told AFP.

Hossain said the crowd was hampering its efforts to reach higher ground as ""thousands of villagers have been constantly following the animal,"" even at night.

Forest official Tapan Kumar Dey told AFP a team had brought a dart gun, crane and lorry to carry the animal once it reaches dry ground and can be tranquilised—but the operation cannot be carried out while the elephant is in water.

""Her condition is very bad. Last night it travelled 12 kilometres, but it mostly avoided dry ground because of presence of so many people,"" Dey said.

A trained elephant was being brought to the scene in a desperate attempt to lure the wild animal away from the water.

""It is so weak that it can't even lift its trunk. You can see her ribs from a distance,"" Ritesh Bhattacharjee, a visiting Indian forest official, told AFP.

The rescue bid comes days after Indian wildlife officers appealed for help in caring for eight rhino calves pulled from the floodwaters in Assam.

Scores of people die every year from flooding and landslides during the monsoon rains in India and neighbouring Nepal and Bangladesh.

So far this year 96 people have died in the worst-hit Indian states of Assam and Bihar while 41 people have died in downstream Bangladesh.

The situation at different parts of the country has turned to worse as there is an acute shortage of pure drinking water in addition to improper sanitation.

The victims are mainly suffering from diseases like diarrhoea, dysentery, fever, eczema, itches and other waterborne diseases.

Amid the situation, many flood-affected people are allegedly being cheated by the health department in some areas including Manikganj as the water purification tablets being distributed among them were found to be ineffective.

The flood victims have been given water purification tablets Halazone, which has not worked, they alleged. The people fell sick after drinking contaminated water as the tablets which they used to purify it failed, they complained.

The tablets were manufactured by Hind Pharma in Bhopal Industrial Area in India in September 2014 and the expiry date is August 2016.

Civil surgeon of Manikganj Dr Emran Ali said the tablets became ineffective due to improper preservation. “I have asked my team members to retrieve the distributed tablets. I have also asked them to stop distributing those tablets anymore,” he added.

Deputy Commissioner of Manikganj Rashida Ferdouse said she was informed about the tablets. She also directed the upazila nirbahi officers to retrieve the distributed tablets from the flood-affected people through the chairmen of the union parishads.

Around three lakh people of 43 unions of Farirampur, Daulatpur, Shivalaya, Ghior, Saturia and Sadar upazila of the district are under threat of health hazards as the floodwater is receding.

As the floodwater is receding, different waterborne diseases like diarrhoea and other intestine diseases are spreading fast among the flood-affected people of Teesta shoals, reports our Nilphamari correspondent.

The flood victims there have taken shelter on different structures of the Water Development Board (WDB) in Dalia of the district.

Acute shortage of pure drinking water in addition to lack of sanitation arrangement is responsible, said Rabiul Islam Shahin, chairman of Tepa Kharibari Union Parishad.

The same situation is prevailing in Lalmonirhat, Gaibandha, Jamalpur and Chandpur.

As there is lack of awareness among the flood victims, they are drinking floodwater-mixed water and are being affected by different waterborne diseases , our correspondent in Lalmonirhat reports.

Jahedul Islam, 48, a flood victim at Ananda Bazar village in Lalmonirhat Sadar upazila, said his widow mother Jahera Bewa, 72, has been suffering from diarrhoea after taking floodwater-mixed water. She has been admitted to Lalmonirhat Sadar Hospital.

“Our two children have also been affected and are under treatment at home,” he added.

Pure drinking water is not available in the flood-affected areas, as all the tube-wells went under water at Khatiyamari Char village in Fulchhari upazila, our Gaibandha correspondent writes.

Marjina Begum, a housewife in the area, said they have taken shelter on the Singria embankment.

Flood victims, cattle and poultry are living side by side on the embankment, resulting in pollution in the living environment.

“I have been suffering from dysentery for last three days, but it has been difficult to arrange preventive medicine,” said Ramjan Ali, a flood victim on the embankment.

Many of the children have been affected by intestinal diseases. Health workers often supply water-purifying tablets and oral saline, but those are not adequate at all, said Abdul Quddus, another flood victim.

Erosion continues in some points of the Padma river due to strong current, our Munshiganj correspondent reports.

Around 150-foot road was eroded due to strong current of the Arial Kha river at Dorga Bazar under Bhaga upazila in the district last Thursday, our Faridpur correspondent reports. The locals worked the whole night to prevent the erosion with the help of WDB.

Md Safikul Islam, a schoolteacher, said the collapse started around 1:30pm, adding, when the strong current with wind hit the road, it eroded the stretch of the road around 4:00pm.

Sultan Mahamud, executive engineer of the WDB of Faridpur, said, “We have continued our work to prevent the erosion. As the locals helped us prevent the collapse and save the road, we have succeeded to avert a big problem.”

He added they have already dropped 15,000 sand sacks and 2,000 bags full of bricks to protect the road.","Sat, 06 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/flood_diseases_1.jpg?itok=GRCMYLEp,"['diseases', 'flood', 'upazila', 'water', 'floodwater', 'victims', 'spread', 'waterborne', 'road', 'drinking', 'receding', 'tablets', 'floodaffected', 'starts']",

The reasons behind the deaths included drowning and snakebite.

Around 3,500 people have been affected by diseases.

The National Health Crisis Management Centre’s control room said a team of 700 health workers were deployed in the affected areas.

Dr Sakhawat Hossain at the control room said the affected people ‘badly’ needed drinking water and saline as well as treatment.

He said most of 643 affected by diseases were diarrhoea patients.

He said no-one had died from the diseases until then.

“Most of those died in past nine days are children. Ten people drowned in past 24 hours.”

Officials said Essential Drugs Company had been asked to produce and store some hundred thousand water purification tablets to deal with eventuality.

According to the Department of Disaster Management (DDM), over 685,000 families in 16 districts have been hit by the flood.

Of them, over 15,000 families have lost their homes to river erosion.

DDM official Saleh Uddin said they were distributing rice, packaged dry food, and molasses among the people.

Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre said the situation in the northern districts was improving, but remained unchanged in the central districts.","Wed, 03 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2016/08/03/faridpur-flood-photo-01.jpg/ALTERNATES/w640/Faridpur-Flood-Photo-01.jpg,"['diseases', 'died', 'flooding', 'affected', 'bangladesh', 'past', 'spread', 'dead', 'health', 'waterborne', '60', 'start', 'room', 'water', 'families', 'districts', 'waters', 'receding', 'management']",

As the Ganga, Brahmaputra, Indus and their tributaries swelled with rain water, large swathes of farmland were inundated in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan. Parts of large cities such as Dhaka, Guwahati, Patna, Allahabad, Lahore, Sialkot and Gujranwala went under water, and the same fate threatened New Delhi.

It is not as if it has been an especially vigorous monsoon. In fact, the India Meteorological Department said the rainfall during June and July has been exactly the same as the long-period average. It has even been 13% deficient in east and northeast India.

Southern Bhutan flooded

Relative to its size, Bhutan is perhaps the worst flood-hit country in South Asia right now. King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuk has joined ministers and officials in the rescue and relief efforts in the southern parts of the country.

With floodwaters and landslides cutting off the highway from Phuentsholing on the India border, landlocked Bhutan is already experiencing shortages of food and fuel. Power transmission lines have been brought down by landslides and many parts of the country are without electricity.

The highway was reopened after five days, and the shortages are expected to ease soon. Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay went public with a declaration that there was enough food in every district warehouse and asked people not to panic.

The department of roads has reported that nine gewogs (districts) were totally cut off when the Buduney Bailey bridge in Samtse district collapsed on July 21. Many other roads, especially to remote districts in the eastern parts of the country, were blocked by landslides.

Floods affected the construction site of the second hydropower project on the Punatsangchu River, with its water diversion tunnel and coffer (temporary) dam under water. Ironically, this was a year when Bhutan had faced a rare drought before the onset of the monsoon, and many farmers had been forced to leave their lands fallow. The Bhutan government is now laying emphasis on developing flood early warning systems along its rivers.

Assam, Bihar worst hit in India

As Bhutan struggles to bring things under control, India’s Northeastern state of Assam is struggling. In terms of size of area affected, it is the worst hit. In the Brahmaputra basin 34 people have died and another 1.1 million have been displaced, according to official records. Kaziranga, the world famous rhinoceros sanctuary on the bank of the Brahmaputra, is flooded – some of the rhinos have been drowned, others run over as they tried to cross a busy road to higher ground.

Such widespread flooding during a normal monsoon season is in line with the prediction of scientists – climate change is leading to fewer rainy days, but more intense rainfall on those days. In this situation, the rainwater has less chance of percolating underground and recharging the water table. It rushes along the surface instead. Riverbeds silted due to ill-planned embankments, dams and barrages do not help.

In many cases, people were flooded out when officials were forced to open the gates of dams or barrages to protect the structures. That is why the Yamuna is flowing above the danger mark in India’s capital New Delhi.

In Himachal Pradesh, the Sutlej – which joins the Indus downstream in Pakistan – has inundated villages through multiple flash floods in the mountain areas. The rains have been followed by landslides throughout the Himalayas. Hundreds of tourists are stuck behind them in the resort town Manali.

Scores killed in Nepal landslides, floods

Over 50 people were killed by landslides and flash floods in Nepal in the last week of July alone, according to the home ministry. The toll since May has crossed 150; of them 97 have been killed by landslides.

In the last week of July, almost all the major rivers of Nepal breached danger levels, which experts say is rare. “Normally it doesn’t happen that almost all rivers get above danger level at the same time but on July 26, the water level on most of the rivers that we monitored was above the danger mark,"" said Binod Parajuli, hydrologist at the department of hydrology and meteorology. ""It is pretty unusual to have such heavy rainfall within a short span of 24 hours.” Climate scientists call it the new normal.

Still, in a country with over 6,000 rivers and rivulets rushing down the steep mountain slopes of the Himalayas, the early warning systems are few and far between. “Flood early warning systems have helped reduce human casualties. If more resources are provided we can reduce it further in coming days,” Parajuli said.

Same story in Bangladesh

By the end of July, floods had killed 14 people in Bangladesh and displaced almost 1.5 million people, washing away 9,000 houses and damaging another 12,000, according to official records. Most of the deaths and damage have taken place in northwestern Bangladesh, where the Brahmaputra enters the country from India.

Ripon Karmakar, duty forecasting officer at the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), does not expect more damage in northwestern Bangladesh, but is more worried about the central and southern parts of the country, as the floodwaters rush to the Bay of Bengal.

Ataur Rahman, a hydrologist who teaches at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, said that apart from floods in Tibet and India, siltation in the rivers and lack of structural measures were worsening the situation.

So far, the government’s response has been to give 5.50 crore Bangladeshi Taka (USD 702,000) and 13,000 tonnes of rice to the affected districts, apart from 13,000 packets of dry food, Disaster Management and Relief Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya said in the last weekend of July.

Parts of Pakistan flooded

Residents of Pakistan’s capital Islamabad are enjoying the downpours this monsoon without being waterlogged, since the city is built on a slope on the Himalayan foothills. But life in the waterlogged parts of Lahore, Sialkot, Gujranwala and other towns along the Indus and its tributaries has come to a standstill.

Islamabad’s twin city Rawalpindi shows how unnecessary it all is. In 2006, the Pakistan Meteorological Department installed an early warning system in Leh Nullah, a natural storm water drain that flows from Islamabad to Rawalpindi. Thanks to the warning, the Rawalpindi city administration now cleans up the city drains on time and gets vigilant about encroachments, so there is no flooding.

The same cannot be said about the northern provinces of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan administered Kashmir and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, where the rainfall so far has been 10-20% above average. By the first week of July, 46 people had already been killed and 21 more injured in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa alone, according to media reports. There are continuous reports of more damage due to lack of preparedness on the part of the government.

“Given the pattern of intensifying monsoons over the past five years, it is becoming imperative that our cities are built with adequate drainage, and that nullahs (storm water drains) are in proper condition prior to the commencement of the monsoon season,"" said Ghulam Rasool of Pakistan Meteorological Department. ""The drainage of rainwater is not rocket science. It requires a little investment, and some government capacity to put in place by-laws and ensure that appropriate space is allocated on roads for the purpose of maintaining storm water drains.”

Predicting heavier rainfall in August, Rasool said, “The showers were not unprecedented, but poor drainage is the reason why our cities are increasingly witnessing urban flooding.” City administrators need to factor in climate change while planning, he added.

Storm water drains were traditionally planned keeping extreme records in mind, but the extremes are being breached more and more often. “We have to look at future projections and develop climate resistant infrastructure,"" he said. ""That is the need of the time, but our engineers have yet to realise this.""

The other problem is encroachment on the drains due to migration from villages to cities. Many of the poor immigrants settle down in low lying areas because they have no alternative.

The report, handed over by Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal to Singh during his day-long visit to survey the flood condition in the state, comprises nine photographs.

Out of this, one is the famous picture of Noakhali flood, where a young man rescues and carries a baby deer amidst flood water.

This photograph of Belal, a young man rescuing a fawn, was taken by wildlife photographer Hasibul Wahab during the Noakhali floods in Bangladesh, and distributed in 2014. The photograph was included in the Assam government’s flood report submitted to Union home minister, Rajnath Singh. (Facebook)

The picture, taken by wildlife photographer Hasibul Wahab and distributed by Caters News Agency in February 2014, received global appreciation at that time.

The photo showed the youth, Belal, in his 20s, risking his life to rescue the baby deer with waters reaching his eyes.

Senior Assam government officials owned up the mistake when pointed out but tried to shift the blame on “some” district collectors (DC) who forwarded the picture to the state capital.

“It is a big mistake. We accept it. Actually some DCs have forwarded this to us because of similarity with situation in Kaziranga National Park,” a senior official said on condition of anonymity.

Another official said residents in and around Kaziranga have been rescuing animals during the current wave of flood and this might have “misled” officials to include the picture.","Sun, 31 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_800x600/HT/p2/2016/07/30/Pictures/rajnath-singh-situation-assam-to-assess-flood_6a163728-5678-11e6-9aeb-9df9517d5433.jpg,"['rajnath', 'flood', '2yrold', 'minister', 'picture', 'includes', 'young', 'noakhali', 'wildlife', 'report', 'bdesh', 'photograph', 'govt', 'wahab', 'assam']",

Aside from being inundated or damaged by the flood, many schools in 18 districts of these two regions had to be shut down due to dwindling attendance of students who along with their family members had to take refuge in flood shelters away from the schools, report our correspondents.

Moreover, in many cases, books and other stationery belonging to a large number of these students had been lost or damaged.

The government will provide new books to the students whose books had been lost or damaged due to the flood, assured education officers of the affected districts, one of them being Mohammad Hossain, primary education officer of Bogra.

When asked how teachers in these schools would compensate for the lost hours in lesson time, Hossain said makeup classes will be arranged in schools in the affected areas.

The makeup classes will start if the flood waters recede in the next two to three days and if necessary, the classes will continue during the weekly or public holidays, he added.

The worst affected district is Kurigram where around 43,000 students of 248 primary schools have been badly affected as their dwellings and schools have been inundated by the flood waters, according to district primary education office (DPEO) sources,

The schools have been closed for around two weeks, said Dabir Uddin, DPEO of Kurigram. However, he said the water has been subsiding day by day.

Our district administration sources in Bogra said in Sariakandi upazila alone, at least 83 primary schools, 10 high schools and one madrasa have been affected by the floods this year and a number of institutions in char (shoal) areas have been washed away completely.

According to Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) operated by Bangladesh Water Development Board, the water levels of the rivers Brahmaputra, Surma, Kushiyara, and Teesta have been falling while that of the Ganges and the Padma have been unchanged. And therefore, the flood situation in the northern and north-eastern districts will improve soon.

In the meantime, water levels in the Balu, Turag, Lakhya and Buriganga will continue to rise over the next 24 hours, worsening the situation around the capital, said FFWC.

Students hit the hardest by the floods this year are the ones living on the chars of the Jamuna and the Teesta where levels of water have been above the danger mark for nearly two weeks.

The situation in Tangail, Munshiganj, Manikganj, Rajbari and Faridpur districts are still worsening, with no sign of respite to the students of the area in sight.

In Tangail, as of yesterday, 420 schools in the district have been inundated. Among them 290 are primary schools and 130 high schools, said Mohammad Mokhlesur Rahman, additional deputy commissioner (education) in Tangail.

As the Ganga, Brahmaputra, Indus and their tributaries swelled with rain water large swathes of farmland were inundated in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan. Parts of large cities such as Dhaka, Guwahati, Patna, Allahabad, Lahore, Sialkot and Gujranwala went under water, and the same fate threatened New Delhi.

It is not as if it has been an especially vigorous monsoon. In fact, the India Meteorological Department says the rainfall during June and July has been exactly the same as the long-period average. It has even been 13% deficient in east and northeast India.

Southern Bhutan flooded

Relative to its size, Bhutan is perhaps the worst flood-hit country in South Asia right now. King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuk has joined ministers and officials in the rescue and relief efforts in the southern parts of the country.

On July 21, the town of Sarpang Bazar was entirely washed away by floodwaters, which also cut off the road to the town of Gelephu. Choden Drukpa, a 40-year-old resident of Sarpang Bazar who earns her living by renting out farmland and shops, said her life had been shattered. She was one of 52 families left homeless when the Sarpang River broke its banks, following continuous heavy rainfall. “We managed to take out some belongings but lost the source of our livelihood, the land,” said Drukpa.

With floodwaters and landslides cutting off the highway from Phuentsholing on the India border, landlocked Bhutan is already experiencing shortages of food and fuel. Power transmission lines have been brought down by landslides and many parts of the country are without electricity. The highway was reopened after five days, and the shortages are expected to ease soon. Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay went public with a declaration that there was enough food in every district warehouse and asked people not to panic.

The department of roads has reported that nine gewogs (districts) were totally cut off when the Buduney Bailey bridge in Samtse district collapsed on July 21. Many other roads, especially to remote districts in the eastern parts of the country, were blocked by landslides.

Floods affected the construction site of the second hydropower project on the Punatsangchu River, with its water diversion tunnel and coffer (temporary) dam under water. Ironically, this was a year when Bhutan had faced a rare drought before the onset of the monsoon, and many farmers had been forced to leave their lands fallow. The Bhutan government is now laying emphasis on developing flood early warning systems along its rivers. See Bhutan struggles with local water shortages

Assam, Bihar worst hit in India

Still, it is in the northeastern state of Assam that the worst flooding has taken place, in the Brahmaputra basin, killing 34 people and displacing 1.1 million, according to official records. Kaziranga, the world famous rhinoceros sanctuary on the bank of the Brahmaputra, is flooded – some of the rhinos have been drowned, others run over as they tried to cross a busy road to higher ground.

Such widespread flooding during a normal monsoon season is in line with the prediction of scientists – climate change is leading to fewer rainy days, but more intense rainfall on those days. In this situation, the rainwater has less chance of percolating underground and recharging the water table. It rushes along the surface instead. Riverbeds silted due to ill-planned embankments, dams and barrages do not help.

It is the same story elsewhere in India, where 118 people have been drowned by floodwaters according to official records, mostly in the Ganga basin states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. The situation is particularly dire in northern Bihar, where the Gandak River has flooded many villages and forced residents to take shelter on railway lines that are built on embankments.

In many cases, people were flooded out when officials were forced to open the gates of dams or barrages to protect the structures. That is why the Yamuna is flowing above the danger mark in India’s capital New Delhi.

In Himachal Pradesh, the Sutlej – which joins the Indus downstream in Pakistan – has inundated villages through multiple flash floods in the mountain areas. The rains have been followed by landslides throughout the Himalayas. Hundreds of tourists are stuck behind them in the resort town Manali.

Scores killed in Nepal landslides, floods

Over 50 people were killed by landslides and flash floods in Nepal in the last week of July alone, according to the home ministry. The toll since May has crossed 150; of them 97 have been killed by landslides.

In the last week of July, almost all the major rivers of Nepal breached danger levels, which experts say is rare. Binod Parajuli, hydrologist at the department of hydrology and meteorology, said, “Normally it doesn’t happen that almost all rivers get above danger level at the same time but on July 26 the water level on most of the rivers that we monitored was above the danger mark. It is pretty unusual to have such heavy rainfall within a short span of 24 hours.” Climate scientists call it the new normal.

The department has geared up its flood-forecasting and early warning wings this year. Through mobile phones, officials are sending messages to residents at risk as soon as a river crosses the danger mark. “We have already signed MOUs (memorandums of understanding) with major mobile companies for free message delivery and our automatic stations measure water level in rivers which we monitor and send alert to the public as well as the concerned ministries for prompt actions for rescue and relief,” Parajuli added. Real time water level data from eight major rivers across the country is available on the department’s website.

Still, in a country with over 6,000 rivers and rivulets rushing down the steep mountain slopes of the Himalayas, the early warning systems are few and far between. “Flood early warning systems have helped reduce human casualties. If more resources are provided we can reduce it further in coming days,” Parajuli said.

Same story in Bangladesh

By the end of July, floods had killed 14 persons in Bangladesh and displaced almost 1.5 million people, washing away 9,000 houses and damaging another 12,000, according to official records. Most of the deaths and damage have taken place in northwestern Bangladesh, where the Brahmaputra enters the country from India.

Ripon Karmakar, duty forecasting officer at the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), does not expect more damage in northwestern Bangladesh, but is more worried about the central and southern parts of the country, as the floodwaters rush to the Bay of Bengal.

Ataur Rahman, a hydrologist who teaches at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, said that apart from floods in Tibet and India, siltation in the rivers and lack of structural measures were worsening the situation.

So far, the government’s response has been to give 5.50 crore Bangladeshi Taka (USD 702,000) and 13,000 tonnes of rice to the affected districts, apart from 13,000 packets of dry food, Disaster Management and Relief Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya said in the last weekend of July.

Poor drainage, encroachments main problem in Pakistan

Residents of Pakistan’s capital Islamabad are enjoying the downpours this monsoon without being waterlogged, since the city is built on a slope on the Himalayan foothills. But life in the waterlogged parts of Lahore, Sialkot, Gujranwala and other towns along the Indus and its tributaries has come to a standstill.

Islamabad’s twin city Rawalpindi shows how unnecessary it all is. In 2006, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) installed an early warning system in Leh Nullah, a natural storm water drain that flows from Islamabad to Rawalpindi. Thanks to the warning, the Rawalpindi city administration now cleans up the city drains on time and gets vigilant about encroachments, so there is no flooding.

The same cannot be said about the northern provinces of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan administered Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), where the rainfall so far has been 10-20% above average. By the first week of July, 46 people had already been killed and 21 more injured in KP alone, according to media reports. There are continuous reports of more damage due to lack of preparedness on the part of the government.

Ghulam Rasool of PMD said, “Given the pattern of intensifying monsoons over the past five years, it is becoming imperative that our cities are built with adequate drainage, and that nullahs (storm water drains) are in proper condition prior to the commencement of the monsoon season. The drainage of rainwater is not rocket science. It requires a little investment, and some government capacity to put in place by-laws and ensure that appropriate space is allocated on roads for the purpose of maintaining storm water drains.”

Predicting heavier rainfall in August, Rasool said, “The showers were not unprecedented, but poor drainage is the reason why our cities are increasingly witnessing urban flooding.” City administrators need to factor in climate change while planning, he added. Storm water drains were traditionally planned keeping extreme records in mind, but the extremes are being breached more and more often. “We have to look at future projections and develop climate resistant infrastructure. That is the need of the time, but our engineers have yet to realise this,” Rasool rued.

The other problem is encroachment on the drains due to migration from villages to cities. Many of the poor immigrants settle down in low lying areas because they have no alternative.","Wed, 03 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://indiaclimatedialogue.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Photo-by-Kshitiz-Anand.jpg,"['monsoon', 'water', 'parts', 'rivers', 'days', 'rainfall', 'drought', 'country', 'killed', 'bhutan', 'floods', '45', 'warning']",

In India, the Brahmaputra river, which is fed by Himalayan snowmelt and monsoon rains, has burst its banks in many places and has been at danger levels for weeks. Hundreds of villages have been flooded in Bihar, Assam, Uttar Pradesh and other northern states.

Some of the heaviest rains in 20 years have forced nearly 1.2 million people to move to camps in Assam. Floods have submerged around 70% of the Kaziringa national park, home to the rare one-horned rhino which was visited by Prince William earlier this year.

“The situation is still very bad. We are taking measures to help people in every possible way,” the Indian forest minister, Pramila Rani Brahma, told Reuters.

In the state of Bihar, 26 people have died, nearly 2.75 million people have been displaced or affected, and 330,000ha of land inundated. Many major rivers are still flowing at or above danger levels.



In China, the summer monsoon which started in June after a series of heatwaves is said to have caused $22bn of damage so far. State officials say it has killed more than 500 people, destroyed more than 145,000 homes and inundated 21,000 sq miles of farmland.



Around 500,000 people were last week still displaced in the hardest-hit central Chinese provinces of Henan and Hebei. According to the Chinese ministry of civil affairs, 125,000 people were in urgent need of basic assistance.



This monsoon season has been one of the strongest in China’s recent history, with 150 towns and cities reportedly suffering record rainfall. The Yangtze river basin has been particularly hard hit, with 22 inches of rain falling in 24 hours last month at Wuhan, the Hebei state capital.

The city, which is downstream of the Three Gorges dam and protected from flooding, was inundated after its drainage system and flood controls failed. Much of the damage is thought to have occurred because the city’s rapid expansion in the past 20 years filled in many small lakes and wetlands which used to store water.

Elsewhere, Nepal has been lashed by torrential monsoon rains, flash floods and landslides. The government says 14 of the mountainous country’s 75 districts have been affected by floods, 54 people have died and many major rivers are running at dangerous levels. Tens of thousands of Nepalese are still living in tents following devastating earthquakes last year.



The army has been deployed to repair dams and helicopters are being used to distribute food and medicines to homeless people who have taken shelter on roads and in upland areas.



Meteorologists say that the 2016 Asian monsoon is one of the strongest in many years, and has been intensified by the El Niño natural phenomenon which sees Pacific water temperatures rise and leads to droughts and severe weather worldwide.



The summer heatwaves that have affected much of the Middle East, north Africa and north America have slackened in the last few days.

“At the [north American] heatwave’s peak on July 22, almost 124 million people in north America were under heat-related warnings or advisories. Additionally, high overnight low temperatures meant little relief from the oppressive heat,” said the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO).

The WMO has set up a committee to examine whether a 54C temperature recorded in Kuwait in July has set the new highest temperature for Asia, as well as for the entire eastern hemisphere.

Climatologists at the WMO said they expected more heatwaves because of climate change. “The length, frequency and intensity of heatwaves will likely increase further during this century, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,” said the agency.

But they said it was likely that only a weak “La Niña” will follow the strong El Niño phenomenon later this year. La Niña is the opposite of El Niño and is marked by cooler temperatures worldwide.","Mon, 01 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aa39481d36087ac8ef0a8d176694383e3537d0a/0_57_5149_3091/5149.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e59ffe9235fe648a16da157b0da1c123,"['monsoon', 'rains', 'state', 'niño', 'record', 'way', 'weather', '2016s', 'temperatures', 'inundated', 'world', 'heatwaves', 'gives', 'heat', 'heavy', 'floods', 'early', 'million', 'north']",

Many flood victims were still living on embankments or government shelter centres while some started returning to damaged homes.

Visiting Jamalpur in the last three days, photojournalist Amran Hossain of The Daily Star saw huge low-lying areas with aman seedlings, fish and vegetables affected by flooding.

“After harvesting, farmers immerse jute plants in water bodies for rotting, but a good portion of the crop has been washed away by floodwaters,” he said.

Some 25 families took shelter at Jarultala Govt Primary School flood shelter centre in Islampur union on July 25.

They alleged the government did not supply any relief aid to them. On July 31, some locals gave them some rotis only.

Having lost crops and fish, farmers were worried about the coming months.

Osimuddin Miah, a farmer in Lalmonirhat Sadar upazila, lost aman paddy on 1.66 acres of land to flooding.

“I borrowed Tk 20,000 from an NGO for cultivating aman, but the floods have ruined everything,” he said yesterday after returning home along with his five-member family from an embankment.

The 62-year-old had no idea about how he would repay the loan, go for growing another crop and repair the house, reports our Lalmonirhat correspondent.

Mofazzal Hossain, 56, a farmer at Shiberkuti village, could not buy aman seedlings as the prices were high.

“If the govt doesn't provide necessary support, we won't be able to grow aman paddy,” he said, adding that it would ultimately have an adverse impact on their livelihood.

Fish farmer Mohammad Ali in Melandah upazila of Jamalpur said he spent Tk 10 lakh for farming in two ponds, but the total investment is lost due to flooding.

As of yesterday, crops on 1.07 lakh hectares in 23 districts have been inundated by floodwaters, according to Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE).

The DAE would make a complete assessment of the damages after the flood is over. Based on the assessment, the government would decide on how to help the affected farmers, DAE Director General Md Hamidur Rahman told The Daily Star.

The government would ensure availability of paddy seedlings and vegetable seeds so that farmers can resume cultivation after the subsidence of floodwaters, he added.

According to the Department of Disaster Management, at least 6,34,409 families in the country's 16 districts, mostly in the north and northeast, have been hit by flooding since mid-July. The deluge killed 21 people and fully damaged some 8,140 houses.

Some 2,000 km of roads and 58.09 km of embankments in Jamalpur; seven km of roads in Nilphamari; 327 km of roads in Sirajganj and 300 metres of dykes in Gaibandha were damaged fully or partially.

Disaster Management and Relief Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya yesterday said the government would take a 40-day programme to rebuild the damaged houses in low-lying areas.

“Immediately after the receding of floodwaters, the government would start rebuilding the damaged homes,” he said while distributing relief materials among the victims in Phulbari of Gaibandha.

Two hundred more flood shelter centres will be built to protect people from flooding, Maya added.

Meanwhile, water levels in the Buriganga, Turag, Balu and Shitalakhya around the capital are rising and the trend might continue in next 24 hours, according to Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC).

“There is no possibility of flooding in northern and western areas of Dhaka. But the low-lying areas in the east might see flooding,” said Ripon Karmaker, assistant engineer of FFWC.","Wed, 03 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/flood_water.jpg?itok=HTEP5hH5,"['flood', 'huge', 'damaged', 'yesterday', 'roads', 'crops', 'aman', 'shelter', 'floodwaters', 'causes', 'farmers', 'km', 'flooding', 'damage']", 
13,13,FL-2016-000075-BGD,Rohingya controversy muddies the waters of flood relief efforts in Myanmar's Rakhine state - Humanosphere,https://www.humanosphere.org/basics/2016/08/rohingya-controversy-muddies-the-waters-of-flood-relief-efforts-in-myanmars-rakhine-state/,"Relentless floods have been sweeping through Asia since June, displacing hundreds of millions of people from their homes in countries including China, India, Bangladesh and the Philippines. Across the region, aid groups are scrambling to coordinate disaster relief with local governments.

But in Myanmar, where nearly 360,000 people have been displaced by flooding, relief efforts are peppered not only with logistical challenges, but also political. As one anonymous aid worker noted, it’s always complicated in Myanmar.

On the western border of the country, next to Bangladesh, sits Rakhine state. Infamous for religious massacres led by Buddhist Rakhine monks on the minority Muslim Rohingya people, the state was hit early in this flood season from late June into July.

But as reports emerged of 10,000 people displaced by flood waters in Rakhine, so did accusations of neglect and obstruction of aid to the Rohingya.

“The flooding has caused massive destruction to the Rohingya IDP [internally displaced persons]camps. … Social groups and aid organizations are not allowed to give any assistance to the Rohingya,” reads a press release by Rohingya rights group, Burma Task Force USA.

Likewise, the European Rohingya Council released a statement in early July, stating: “The Rakhines are evacuated…while the Rohingya were left helpless. …The Rohingya, who are already displaced and living in squalid IDP camps, are not getting helps (sic) from the state government.”

Mainstream media has been reporting on the plight of the Rohingya for several years. Described as being “among the world’s least wanted and most persecuted people,” the Rohingya are considered migrants from Bangladesh by the government of Myanmar and, therefore, denied citizenship and free movement out of closely guarded villages and internally displaced persons (IDP) camps. The horrific conditions of these camps have been compared to concentration camps, with little access to health care, food, education or economic opportunity.

Considering Myanmar’s track record with the Rohingya, these allegations of neglect amid devastating flood conditions are not surprising.

That’s exactly what aid groups working in Rakhine said when asked by Humanosphere for comment. What is surprising, however, is what they said next: The IDP camps are not flooded, and there is no evidence of major gaps in assistance.

“Plan International is [a]non-religious organization and is currently working with both Rakhine and Muslim communities in Rakhine State,” said Jessica Lawson, communications manager for Plan International Myanmar, to Humanosphere in an email.

When Humanosphere asked the Rohingya rights groups for proof of their allegations, their representatives spoke vaguely of sources in Myanmar and of the government’s history of offenses against the Rohingya. The European Rohingya Council did provide a video, but Humanosphere was unable to verify whether the footage was indeed of a flooded Rohingya village. Both groups promised updates from their sources, but they never delivered.

On the other hand, the aid groups that spoke with Humanosphere were willing to answer a few more questions on the condition of anonymity, due to the sensitive political climate and fear of being expelled.

For example, why didn’t the IDP camps experience flooding when the surrounding areas all did? Apparently, Rohingya communities are not built near rivers, since riverbanks are the most fertile – but also the most flood-prone – lands, says one aid worker.

Since relief efforts are being coordinated by the local government – as they should, said an aid group spokesperson to Humanosphere – are there concerns that the government may be withholding information from aid workers on Rohingya communities in need of assistance?

The rights groups say, yes. But the aid workers, who are on the ground, maintain that they’ve received all the information they need to work in their assigned areas.

“We worked together with the Township Administrator to determine where the worst-affected areas are, and we have distributed accordingly,” said Lawson of Plan International. Another group is taking instructions from the Ministry of Health on where to provide services.

Amid all the “he said, she said,” the aid groups want to make one important distinction: Immediate recovery assistance is a separate effort from daily access to basic human rights. In those matters, there is no denying that the 1 million stateless Rohingya are suffering. That is why aid groups and rights groups alike repeatedly said to Humanosphere that they “wouldn’t be surprised,” by an imbalance in aid on the part of the government.

But when it comes to immediate flood recovery assistance, the aid workers who spoke with Humanosphere insist there is no discrimination based on class, race or religion. Humanitarian assistance, one aid worker said, is based on needs and vulnerability, and Rakhine, being one of the poorest states, is particularly vulnerable.

Still, the best “evidence” of equal aid distribution they could provide was “no evidence of major gaps.”

Of course, some of this alleged neglect may also be logistical. Many roads have been reported to be completely blocked off, and certain areas are difficult to access even by boat. This is a challenge the rights groups acknowledge.

“Most of the [international nongovernmental organizations]are crowded in Sittwe, [the capital of Rakhine]. The IDPs in [the]rest of Rakhine state are rarely getting aids (sic) … probably due to travel restrictions,” said Hla Kyaw, researcher at the European Rohingya Council.

For now, flood waters may be receding in Rakhine, but it doesn’t look like the political controversy is going anywhere soon. Human rights leaders were hopeful when Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi assumed power earlier this year. But so far, she’s made it clear that her government will not even use the controversial term “Rohingya.”

Aid workers say the severity of this year’s floods can be expected annually. Without significant change in the political climate toward the Rohingya, continued accusations should be expected as well.","Wed, 10 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.humanosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Myanmar-flooding-file.jpg,"['flood', 'idp', 'humanosphere', 'controversy', 'rights', 'state', 'rakhine', 'waters', 'myanmars', 'muddies', 'groups', 'camps', 'efforts', 'relief', 'aid', 'rohingya']",

The villagers had been talking all morning. There was some water seeping through the embankment along the Brahmaputra, they said, so Ruparam Das, 52, a fisherman in Kaivartagaon, a village in the river island of Majuli, decided to check out for himself. Around 3 pm on July 26, as he stood in front of the river, a few metres downstream from his house, he heard a loud bang. The river had broken through the embankment, but not where he stood. Instead, the river had torn through the wall right in front of his house. His house, as well as those of his neighbours, Bitul Das and Babul Das, had vanished. In their place flowed the Brahmaputra, an angry and swirling river of mud.

“I have nothing left, no house, no belongings. Luckily, my wife and four children rushed out a few seconds before this happened,” says Das, who is now among the 200 villagers at the Bongaon Primary School that has been converted into a relief camp.

The waters have since receded, but not before leaving behind a thick sheet of silt and sand, 10 to 12 feet thick, over hundreds of acres of what used to be fields of paddy and sugarcane. People in relief camps such as the one in the Bongaon school have since left and started repairing their homes. But Ruparam and 10 of his neighbours have nowhere to go.

The Brahmaputra, one of the mightiest rivers in the world, runs through Assam like a throbbing vein, sustaining lives and livelihood along its banks. But every monsoon, the lifeline snaps, breaks all boundaries and causes widespread misery to about 20 of the state’s 32 districts.

The Brahmaputra Valley is said to be one of the most hazard-prone regions of the country — according to the National Flood Commission of India (Rashtriya Barh Ayog), about 32 lakh hectares or over 40 per cent of the state’s land is flood-prone.

So far, 35 people have lost their lives to the floods and about 12 lakh people have been temporarily displaced. According to the Assam State Disaster Management Authority, over 40,000 houses have borne the brunt of the floods, while the damage to infrastructure — embankments, dykes, roads, bridges, schools, anganwadi centres — runs into several hundred crores of rupees.

“Whenever we take one step forward towards development, floods and erosion push us two steps backwards. While we spend around Rs 12,000 crore on development every year, floods and erosion cause a loss of about Rs 10,000 annually,” says Assam Chief Secretary V K Pipersenia.

“Three successive waves of floods that began in May have caused huge losses to the state. While a final assessment of the damage is still being worked out, the Brahmaputra and the Barak (the second biggest river in the state), together with their numerous tributaries, have caused 26 breaches in embankments,” says state Water Resource Minister Keshab Mahanta.

***

As another flood ravages Assam, displacing hundreds of people and damaging property worth crores, the question is, why does the the Brahmaputra spill over with such alarming frequency?

Experts say the problem begins with the embankments, the very structures that are meant to keep the flood waters away.

The embankments constructed along the banks of the Brahmaputra, its 103 tributaries, many of which come down from Bhutan and Tibet, and the Barak run into over 4,475 km. Many of these structures, constructed over a period of 25 to 30 years based on the 1954 recommendations of the Rashtriya Barh Ayog, show visible signs of ageing. “Though embankments don’t have specific life-spans, the ones in Assam are designed on the basis of flood data of 15 to 20 years and are supposed to remain fit for 25 to 30 years,” says a senior officer in the state water resource department.

While natural wear and tear — surface run-off due to rain and rats digging burrows through the earthen structure — is one reason, most embankments across the state are also used as roads by villagers who ply motorbikes, bullock-carts, tractors, cars and trucks on them. Hundreds of families in Majuli and other flood-hit areas have made these embankments their homes by building bamboo houses on them.

The gaping hole in the embankment wall at Dergaon, an Assembly segment in Golaghat district of the state, tells this story of how the embankment lost the battle to the river.

Sitting at his home in Amguri, a village of Mising tribals in Dergaon that’s right behind the embankment, Bhishma Kaman, 65, says, “The water-level kept rising since June 25 and we were worried. The embankment, which was built some 40 years ago, had shown signs of seepage at three or four spots just in front of our village. We called up the flood control office and informed them. But even before the officials could arrive, on July 27, the river brought down the embankment.”

Luckily for Kaman, the breach happened near Dainigaon, about two and a half kilometres from his village. Though Amguri village was spared, others such as Dainichapori, Lemchapori, Chokial Nepaligaon, Tayung Gaon, Koilaghat, Na-bhanga, Birinagaon, Kumoliyachapori, Khakandaguri, Lengera, Garmora, Joraguri — all in the Dergaon assembly segment of Golaghat district — were flooded. But this year, the villagers were not caught unawares. They knew the river had been rising so they had evacuated a couple of nights ago.

While it has been raining in different parts of the state since the first week of July, experts say the above normal rainfall in upper Assam and Arunachal Pradesh is not the only reason for the floods; environmental degradation in neighbouring hill states is part of the problem.

Only the Amazon carries more water than the Brahmaputra, one of the largest rivers in the world with an annual flow of about 573 billion cubic metres at Jogighopa, close to the Indo-Bangladesh border. But its waters carry a great deal of sediments, raising the river by about three metres in places and thus reducing its water-carrying capacity. Landslides and increasing topsoil erosion in the river’s catchment areas, particularly in Arunachal Pradesh from where come down most of the Brahmaputra’s major tributaries, have added to the river’s sediments.

As the river rages on, it eats into the soft alluvial soil of the state, eroding land along the banks. A recent study sponsored by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said the Brahmaputra had eroded 388 sq km of land in the state between 1997 and 2008. According to the state government, Assam has lost more than 4.27 lakh hectares — 7.4 per cent of its area — to erosion by the Brahmaputra and its tributaries since 1950. That has made the Brahmaputra among the widest rivers in the world, more than 15 km in places.

Since July 24, the Aie, a tributary of the Brahmaputra that comes down from Bhutan and flows through Chirang and Bongaigaon districts, has eroded more than 2 sq km of land in Chota-Nilibari and Dababeel villages. “The river simply swallowed our land. It was so swift that only a few families could remove the tin sheets, wooden doors and timber posts of their houses, apart from a few household items. What could we have done? You cannot remove the walls and the floor,” says Swapan Basumatary, 32, a marginal farmer who lost three bighas in Chota-Nilibari and whose family is now lodged at a relief camp in Subaijhar, Chirang district, with 46 other families.

According to the Brahmaputra Board, deforestation in Assam and its neighbouring states have accelerated the process of land erosion. According to the Forest Survey of India Report 2015, Arunachal Pradesh’s forest cover has reduced by 162 sq km between 2011 and 2015, Assam has lost 48 sq km of forest cover in the same period, Meghalaya 71 sq km, and Nagaland 78 sq km.

“Managing the Brahmaputra is a big challenge. For instance, while the Mississippi’s catchment is four times the Brahmaputra, at 700 million tonnes per annum, Brahmaputra’s sediment load is four times the Mississippi’s,” says Anju Gaur, a water specialist with the World Bank. Gaur, who was in Guwahati last week to attend a two-day workshop organised by the state Department of Water Resource on floods and erosion, suggested a few best practices deployed in others countries to control the damage caused due to river floods.

“Constructing reservoirs to hold the water during the monsoons is one way of reducing floods. Besides, countries such as The Netherlands have adopted practices such as ‘room for the river’, a concept of rejuvenating wetlands that will then work as a flood cushion,” she says.

Chandan Mahanta of IIT Guwahati agrees that rejuvenating the state’s 3,500 wetlands is a “brilliant” concept. “We have numerous wetlands which can take off a major portion of the Brahmaputra’s energy during high floods,” says Mahanta.

The Brahmaputra Board, in its studies and master-plans, had suggested, in the early ’80s, the construction of storage dams upstream of the major tributaries, which would also help generate power. But while strong opposition by various groups has stalled one such project, the 2,000-MW Lower Subansiri project, most other projects are yet to take off. The Assam government, meanwhile, has asked experts to study if the main channel of the Brahmaputra can be dredged. One such attempt made in the late 1970s remained a non-starter though two dredgers were brought in from abroad.

The floods have dealt the new BJP-led government of Sarbananda Sonowal its first big challenge. Last week, the state government got experts from various agencies, including the World Bank, ADB, Brahmaputra Board, and IIT Guwahati, to take part in the two-day brainstorming exercise.

“While many states in the country have been crying for water, Assam has been suffering from lack of expertise to control this huge resource,” said Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, during the workshop.

Last week, Sonowal also asked the water resource department to set up ‘embankment protection committees’ of departmental engineers, youth organisations, NGOs, clubs and socio-cultural organisations to keep an eye on the embankments and help avert breaches.

The government has carried out routine relief in the form of distribution of supplies and providing healthcare to those in camps. Families of the 35 people who died in the floods have been given Rs 4 lakh each.

But unlike his predecessor, Sonowal has refrained from asking the Centre for financial aid, something for which he has drawn a lot of flak. “What is the use asking for funds and packages in the middle of the floods? We are making a thorough assessment as the floods recede. The Centre is sending an inter-ministerial team. These reports, along with the recommendations of the experts, will help us in finding a permanent solution to the floods,” says Sonowal.

Immediately after the floods of 2014, which affected over 42 lakh people and left 68 people dead, the Tarun Gogoi-led state government had asked for Rs 5,700 crore from the Centre — Rs 3,500 crore to strengthen embankments, Rs 2,000 crore for anti-erosion measures and rehabilitation of affected people, and Rs 200 crore for construction of 5,000 raised platforms and relief centres.

While successive governments have failed to come up with a solution to the state’s recurring floods, Pratima Boro believes she has found a way out. “We will have to simply learn to live with it,” says the 67-year-old, sitting outside a shed along the Guwahati-Morigaon state highway that has been her home for over 10 days. Pratima is glad her two daughters are married into families who live in the Kharghuli hills in Guwahati and not in villages such as theirs. “The floods come and go every year and some government officials come, take down our details and go back. We get a few kilogrammes of rice, some dal, mustard oil and salt for a few days. By the time we repair our houses on our own, the monsoon is back and, with it, the floods,” she says.

(Source: Google Maps) Teesta Barrage along Indo-Bhutan border. (Source: Google Maps)

North Bengal Development Minister in the West Bengal government, Rabindranath, Ghosh on Saturday said that the state government was pushing for the formation of an “Indo-Bhutan Joint River Commission” with the Centre to be able to address the issue of frequent flooding in the northern areas of the state. Bengal shares it northern border with Bhutan, and most of the Bhutan rivers flow through this region before entering Bangladesh. Speaking with The Indian Express, Ghosh said that initial estimates show that Bengal has incurred loss of at least Rs 1,000 crores in the recent floods.

India and Bangladesh have a Joint River Commission where issues pertaining to the Teesta and the Brahmaputra are discussed.

While the flood situation stabilized in the Dooars, excessive rainfall from last night has led to the overflowing of the Farakka Barrage in Malda district. After completing his meeting on mitigating measures for flooding in Siliguri on Friday, Ghosh rushed to Malda. “There is a 500 metre bandh near the Farakka which has broken due to excessive rainfall, which started at 8.30 pm last night. As many as 110 homes have been swept away,” said Ghosh adding that the residents had escaped and were being kept in relief camps at Binnagar. A BDO has been kept on standby near the area. The incident took place approximately two kilometers from the Farakka barrage.

“We have been pushing for the river commission. We had appraised our Chief Minister of the matter before her visit to Bhutan and she had raised it with the officials there. The problem is that we neighbor Nepal, Bihar and Bhutan. And whenever there is flooding there, they let out the excess water to Bengal. And the seven districts in North Bengal, as in this year as well, are always the worst hit. Bhutan is especially a problem. There are 72 rivers in Bhutan that flow through these seven districts before entering Bangladesh. And they don’t really have a system of dams or bandhs by which to control excess water,” said the Minister.

Ghosh added that broke in Budhin area of Bhutan has led to fresh flooding in North Bengal. Irrigation Minister Rajib Bannerjee has reiterated Ghosh’s demand for a river commission between the two countries at Friday’s meeting in Siliguri.

Last year the matter had been taken up with the Union Minister for Water Resources but the Bengal Ministers say that no headway has been made on the matter. The Bengal government plans to pitch proposals for the construction of barrages and water reservoirs in Bhutan and in some places in north Bengal to regulate the flow of water. Deposition of dolomite dust and pebbles, boulders and trees flowing down from Bhutan in Bengal’s river beds is another issue that needs to be taken up, said officials in the government. Bhutan carries out Dolomite mining near its rivers. Because of the deposition from the Bhutan rovers, the riverbeds in Bengal become higher and banks are breached often, creating flood like situations. Dolomite deposit further reduces the fertility of the land and therefore large tracts of land in north Bengal, which is a prime tea growing area in the country, become non-cultivable.

The Jaldhaka, Diana, Kaljani, Torsha, Leesh, Geesh and Raidak are some of the major rivers from Bhutan that flow through Bengal.

Saying that at least 66,000 people in Bengal have been affected by the floods this year, Ghosh added that the state government was constructing temporary barrages in most rivers. “Some rivers are so large that it is not possible to construct the temporary barrages under such circumstances. But we hope that the barrages being constructed will help control and mitigate the flooding,” he told The Indian Express.

Ghosh said that at least 100 tea gardens across North Bengal have been inundated. “But it’ll be at least a week before we have initial estimates as to the losses from the tea gardens. The Rs 1000 crore loss estimate is based on the infrastructure destroyed in this year floods. Bridges across North Begal have been swept away and crops have been ruined,” he said.","Sun, 31 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/07/teesta-barrage-480.jpg,"['minister', 'water', 'wants', 'west', 'rivers', 'flow', 'north', 'mitigate', 'river', 'bhutan', 'ghosh', 'set', 'floods', 'flooding', 'indobhutan', 'commission', 'help', 'bengal']", 
17,17,FL-2016-000075-BGD,Massive flood may have led to China's earliest empire - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/08/massive-flood-may-have-led-chinas-earliest-empire,"Many cultures trace their origins to the hazy horizon where history meets legend. In China's case, that blurry line occurs sometime between 2200 B.C.E. and 2000 B.C.E., when a legendary hero named Yu tamed Yellow River flooding and earned a mandate to become the founding emperor of the Xia dynasty, the country's first. That’s the story according to texts written long after the fact, and many Chinese believe their civilization started with emperor Yu. But archaeologists have been unable to find convincing evidence for either the flood or the Xia dynasty itself.

Now, an international team of scientists drawn from the fields of archaeology, anthropology, seismology, and geology have gathered disparate evidence from ancient texts, sedimentary deposits, earthquake-triggered landslides, and skeletons in collapsed cave dwellings to craft a scenario presented this week in Science that they claim supports the legend of a great flood and hints that the Xia dynasty might be real. If the findings hold up, they could lend credence to early historical texts and help resolve a long-running debate over the origins of China and its people.

It is ""a groundbreaking study,"" says Qingwei Sun, an archaeologist at Peking University in Beijing who was not involved in the work. Still, ""more data is needed [for the findings] to be widely accepted,"" he says.

The paper was nearly a decade in the making. In spring 2007, the study's lead author, geologist Qinglong Wu, was working as a postdoc at the China Earthquake Administration's Institute of Geology in Beijing, when his team found ancient lakebed sediments in the Jishi Gorge at the upper reaches of the Yellow River, about 1300 kilometers west of Beijing. They speculated that at some point a lake had formed in the gorge behind rubble from a landslide. If that dam gave away, they reasoned, it would have caused a major flood.

Following a hunch that came during a sleepless night in July 2008, Wu traveled 25 kilometers downstream from the gorge, where a major earthquake had destroyed numerous cave dwellings in a Neolithic settlement called Lajia. Subsequently, a thick layer of mud engulfed the ruins and the victims, preserving them for discovery in the 1990s. Wu found that the Lajia mud matched material from Jishi Gorge, suggesting that the same earthquake that had destroyed the dwellings had also triggered the upstream landslide that set the stage for the flood. Because the sediment was quite different from what would have been washed into the ruins by rainstorms, ""the earthquake and flood must have occurred in the same year,"" says Darryl Granger, a geologist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, who is a co-author of the paper.

At that point, Wu began thinking that this event could be the basis for China’s great flood legend. ""I didn’t tell others because it would invite laughter,"" he says. Instead, he quietly gathered evidence from lake deposits in the gorge and flood sediments downstream, and reached out to specialists around the world to help him interpret the data. The team concluded that the landslide created a dam 200 meters high that choked off the mighty Yellow for 6 to 9 months. The rising water finally overtopped the rubble and then quickly washed it away, causing a torrent that could have been among the largest floods of the Holocene epoch, Granger says. It is difficult to determine when ancient floods happened, but radiocarbon dating of the Lajia human remains pegged the catastrophes to about 1900 B.C.E.

The massive flood “provides us with a tantalizing hint that the Xia dynasty might really have existed,"" says David Cohen, an archaeologist and co-author at National Taiwan University in Taipei. The devastating flood could have inundated settlements even a thousand or more kilometers downstream, he says, and created chaos from which a new political order emerged. This sequence of events neatly fits the legend of Yu controlling the flooding by dredging channels to confine the Yellow River and its tributaries. This feat, the ancient texts say, allowed him to claim a mandate as the first emperor of the Xia dynasty.

The timing is curiously coincidental. Around 1900 B.C.E., Cohen says, Chinese society was transitioning from the Neolithic to the Bronze age. The date also correlates with what is called the Erlitou culture, which is known from palace buildings and bronze smelting workshops discovered near Zhengzhou, about 2500 kilometers downstream from Jishi Gorge. Many scholars have argued that Erlitou is a manifestation of the elusive Xia dynasty, but a link is not firmly established.

Nevertheless, with hard evidence of a catastrophic flood occurring at a time of social and political change, ""It's an amazing story of all these different lines of evidence coming together,"" Cohen says. “If the great flood really happened, then the Xia dynasty likely happened, too,” he concludes.

""It's a thought-provoking piece of work,"" agrees Tristram Kidder, an archaeologist at Washington University in St. Louis in Missouri, who works on several sites on the lower Yellow River. ""They've done a great job showing that there was a major, catastrophic flood.”

But Haiwang Liu, an archaeologist at the Henan Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology in Zhengzhou, China, who collaborates with Kidder, says that at their sites in the lower Yellow, ""no hard physical evidence of great floods during that time has been found."" And Lothar von Falkenhausen, an archaeologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, cautions against ""proposing too direct a linkage between such environmental events with semimythical accounts recorded in texts of much later date.""

The new paper's findings are also at odds with other recent studies, which have proposed alternative explanations for both the Jishi Gorge deposits and the Lajia sediment, says Wenxiang Wu, a geographer at the Chinese Academy of Sciences's Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research in Beijing. He adds that recent radiocarbon dating refinements have suggested the Erlitou culture thrived between 1750 B.C.E. and 1530 B.C.E.—much later than the proposed new date for the Xia dynasty. The paper ""needs more supporting evidence,"" for its claims regarding a great flood and the Xia dynasty, Wenxiang Wu concludes.

Qinglong Wu, now at Nanjing Normal University, acknowledges the paper is certain to stir up several long-simmering controversies. But in trying to make sense of disparate historical and physical evidence ""our data involves fewer contradictions"" than alternative explanations, he says.

One point all agree on is the need for further study. Finding evidence for a great flood along the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River ""would undoubtedly strengthen the persuasiveness of the paper,” Sun says. Wu’s team ""sets out a hypothesis we can follow up—it gives us something to look for,"" Kidder says.","Thu, 04 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/cc_yellowriver_16x9.jpg?itok=X8Wb7xvj,"['flood', 'xia', 'yellow', 'texts', 'gorge', 'chinas', 'great', 'massive', 'wu', 'university', 'empire', 'led', 'earliest', 'evidence', 'dynasty']",

Take, for example, green chilli. The item was selling at between Tk 90 and 100 per kilogram at different city markets yesterday, up from Tk 60 a week ago.

Prices of eggplant, okra, pointed gourd, ridge gourd and leafy vegetables like red amaranth have also soared.

Eggplant of different qualities was selling at Tk 40-50 a kg, an increase by Tk 10-15 from a week ago. However, a few retailers were asking Tk 60 and above for a kg of eggplant on the grounds of offering better quality.

Retailers blamed supply shortages for the price hike.

Apart from vegetables, prices of rice, onion, sugar and salt have also gone up over the last one month.

“The rainfall and flooding in northern districts is to blame for the spike in vegetable prices,” said Mohsin Munshi, a vegetable retailer at Hatirpool kitchen market.

Mohammad Kamal Hossain, another vegetable retailer at the market, was found asking Tk 40 for each kg of pointed gourd.

He said prices of green chilli had been rising for the last three to four days due to poor supply.

Kamal last week bought each kg of green chilli at Tk 35-36 from Karwan Bazar wholesale market. He claimed to have purchased it at Tk 60 per kg yesterday.

“The prices of fresh produce fluctuate depending on supply. Prices of green chilli have risen due to floods in the country's north,” said wholesaler Mohammad Ashraful Alam who was offering customers the vegetable at Tk 50 a kg.

According to data of Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), floodwater in 10 northern districts has inundated crops, including vegetables, paddy and jute, on more than 12,000 hectares of land.

A senior DAE official said vegetable plants would be affected the most. “Plants would die if they remained submerged for a couple of days. This might affect vegetable production,” he noted.

Delwar Hossain, a vegetable wholesaler at Karwan Bazar, said prices of vegetables usually remained high in the rainy season compared to those in other seasons of the year due to flooding.

Mohammad Lokman, who runs a shop with his brother at a kitchen market in the city's Kazipara, said prices of eggplants went up by at least Tk 10-15 in the last one or two weeks. He sold the item at Tk 40-60 a kg yesterday. A week ago, he sold it for Tk 40-50 per kg.

However, prices of potatoes remained stable at Tk 25 a kg, Lokman added.

Prices of onion, sugar, garlic, salt and bottled soybean oil have soared, according to the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh. Onion was selling at Tk 25-45 per kg yesterday, up from Tk 20-40 a month ago.

Alamgir Hossain, an importer at Bhomra Land Port, said import of onion slowed down as the Indian authorities allowed only 70 truckloads of onion into Bangladesh every day to ease pressure of shipment of other goods. This has caused onion prices to rise.

Prices of sugar, which started increasing during the month of Ramadan in June, edged up 12 percent to Tk 70-74 per kg yesterday from Tk 63-65 a month ago, influenced by higher international prices, according to traders.

On the other hand, prices of broiler chicken have slumped by 15 percent to Tk 140-150 a kg from a month ago.","Sat, 30 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/vegetable_prices_flood.jpg?itok=pRJZCt1a,"['flood', 'tk', 'green', 'yesterday', 'vegetable', 'spreads', 'kg', 'vegetables', 'month', 'onion', 'week', 'prices']",

Authorities have declared holidays to schools and colleges for two days in view of rains.

Senior officials, including Police Commissioner S. Jagannathan and Collector Radhakrishanan are closely monitoring the flood situation.

Meanwhile, heavy rush of people to witness flood caused traffic snarls in areas like Someshwar, Old Nashik, Holkar Bridge, etc.

This is an exciting year for archaeology in Asia! As I have discussed earlier, new discoveries have transformed our understanding of the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC). Now, new research presented in Science has shed new light on the origins of Chinese civilization.

Chinese historiography generally presents Chinese history through the lens of various dynasties. The earliest historically attested dynasty is the Shang Dynasty, which arose around 1600 B.C.E. However, traditional Chinese histories speak of a Xia Dynasty that existed before the Shang. Many modern scholars, both Western and Chinese, have questioned the existence of the Xia, noting that many of the characteristics associated with Xia Dynasty are merely the opposite of the Shang, thus leading to the belief that the Xia were created as a sort of foil for the Shang. Nonetheless, whether or not there were dynasties and states, there is evidence of agriculture and advanced social organization in China going back several thousands of years before the Shang.

According to traditional Chinese histories, “sometime between 2200 B.C.E. and 2000 B.C.E., … a legendary hero named Yu tamed Yellow River flooding and earned a mandate to become the founding emperor of the Xia dynasty, the country’s first.”

Now, new research indicates there is truth to this ancient story. The paper in Science is the culmination of over ten years of research from “the fields of archaeology, anthropology, seismology, and geology.” The research indicates that the Yellow River did indeed flood, though somewhat later than the traditional starting date of the Xia Dynasty, 2070 B.C.E. According to researchers, the flood occurred around 1920 B.C.E.

Whoever managed to bring the flood under control–the man traditionally known as Yu–probably oversaw irrigation and digging work that allowed water to be guided back into its proper channels. According to the study, restoring order after the chaos earned “him the divine mandate to establish the Xia dynasty, the first in Chinese history.”

According to the findings of the research, the flood occurred when a vast landslide, the result of an earthquake, blocked the Yellow River in Qinghai province (near Tibet). This lead to the formation of a lake behind the blocked river; eventually the natural dam was breached, leading to a flood downstream, where the ancestors of today’s Chinese people inhabited farming settlements.

The flood was one of the largest known floods of the past 10,000 years according to Darryl Granger, professor in the department of Earth atmospheric planetary sciences at Purdue University. The floodwaters surged to 38 meters above the modern river level.

Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia and 17 other U.S. military installations sitting on waterfront property are looking at hundreds of floods a year and in some cases could be mostly submerged by 2100, according to a new report from the Union of Concerned Scientists. Based on these calculations, the report says a three-foot sea level rise would threaten 128 U.S. military bases, valued at roughly $100 billion.



Nine of those bases are major hubs for the Navy: In addition to Norfolk, flooding threatens Naval Station Mayport, Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia and the Naval Academy in Maryland, where 2003's Hurricane Isabel flooded classrooms, dormitories and athletic facilities.



It's not just the Navy. Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island is at risk of being completely underwater. All told, three Marine Corps installations, two joint bases, an Air Force base and a Coast Guard Station are also at risk of daily flooding, the report said.



Those are the findings of a study released Wednesday by the scientific non-profit organization, which has published research into climate change, fuel efficiency standards and the use of antibiotics on livestock.



Some installations, including those in the Hampton Roads, Virginia, area, already have measures in place to protect against storm surges, study authors told Navy Times.



""There are lots of things that can be done and all of the things require quite a bit of resources,"" climate scientist Astrid Caldas said in a Thursday phone interview.



The Defense Department is taking the research under advisement.



""DoD values the UCS's insights into the impacts of climate change on military installations,"" Air Force Lt. Col. Eric Badger told Navy Times. ""We welcome their report and its findings. We recognize climate change impacts and their potential threats represent one more risk that we must consider as we make decisions about our installations, infrastructure, weapons systems and most of all, our people.""



The study began as a look at the effects of heavy storms on coastal bases, but the scope expanded as they got deeper ​.



""We were surprised at how much permanent inundation occurs,"" Caldas said. ""Originally we were focusing on hurricane storm surge. When we decided to do tidal flooding, that’s when it hit us.""



That original goal is the reason the study focused on East and Gulf Coast installations, because the West Coast doesn't have regular tropical storms.



""Knowing what we know now about tidal flooding, looking back it would have been good to include the West Coast,"" Caldas added.



The findings could also apply to military installations overseas, she said, though parts of Alaska and some Pacific Islands are actually seeing a reduction in sea level.



""Most likely the majority of the coasts around the world will see sea level rise,"" she said.



Underwater



Using two scientific models, experts from UCS examined installations from Maine down to Florida and over to Georgia, finding them all subject to more frequent and extensive flooding. Ocean rise makes areas close to sea level more exposed to the daily comings and goings of tides, up to and including parts of bases staying completely under water, and disastrous flooding from storms.



""These climate-driven trends are already complicating operations at certain coastal installations,"" according to the report. ""A roughly three-foot increase in sea level would threaten 128 coastal DoD installations in the United States (43 percent of which are naval installations, valued at roughly $100 billion) and the livelihoods of the people — both military personnel and civilians — who depend on them.""



That figure, precisely 3.7 feet, is a conservative estimate of the amount of worldwide sea rise the Earth will see between 2012 and 2100, per the 2013 National Climate Assessment. That ""intermediate"" model assumes moderate ice sheet melt, with a 1.1-foot rise by 2050.



In the ""highest"" scenario, sea levels would rise 1.7 feet with rapid ice sheet loss by 2050, and ultimately by 6.3 feet come 2100.



""By 2050 in both scenarios, sea level rise drives early instances of land loss — defined in this analysis as land that floods with daily tides, making it unusable,"" according to the report.



Hitting home



Hurricane Isabel flooded classrooms and laboratories at the Naval Academy in 2013. A new report warns that Annapolis and 17 other military bases could contend with hundreds of floods a year by 2100. Photo Credit: Matt Houston/AP Sixteen of the installations studied would experience more than 100 floods every year and low-lying areas underwater for 10 to 25 percent of the year, the study found. Three installations would lose 10 percent of their land in the ""intermediate"" scenario and 25 percent in the ""highest.""



The Navy installations on track for daily flooding are:





Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Maine.

The Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.

Naval Support Facility Anacostia in Washington, DC.

Washington Navy Yard in Washington, DC.

Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia.

Naval Air Station Oceana/Dam Neck Annex, Virginia.

Naval Station Mayport, Florida.

Naval Air Station Key West, Florida.

Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Georgia.

The other branches' bases at similar risks to daily flooding:

Coast Guard Station Sandy Hook, New Jersey.

Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, DC.

Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia.

Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina.

Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina.

Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.

By 2100, the report found, Key West, Langley-Eustis, Dam Neck Annex and Parris Island could be between 75 and 95 percent under water.

Langley-Eustis already has extensive flood protections, according to study author Shana Udvardy, who visited the Hampton Roads bases as part of her research.

""At Langley, [we] saw some of the natural defenses in place,"" she said, including a living shoreline, door dams to prevent surge, a pump to remove storm water from the base and a warning system linked to NASA storm tracking.

Dam Neck Annex, Caldas added, has a rock-filled sea wall covered in sand on its shoreline.

Raising buildings is also an option, Udvardy said, though it's harder with many of the historical buildings on military installations. Newer facilities like housing would be more straightforward.

But for some installations, there's very little space to allow for regular flooding or to move structures inland.

""For a place like Key West that’s facing up to 95 percent of permanent inundation, there’s not a lot of land to retreat to,"" Caldas said.","Fri, 29 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/1mxokRareUHTnWUOM_bsyvqomq8=/1200x630/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-mco.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DOS3F33ZFBDYNMTR3F6BYQNYXI.jpg,"['oceans', 'installations', 'station', 'rise', 'submerge', 'rising', 'bases', '128', 'naval', 'military', 'navy', 'threaten', 'base', 'report', 'sea', 'flooding']",

Recent flooding in West Virginia is estimated to have damaged or destroyed more than 1,200 homes and claimed more than 20 lives. Unfortunately, only about 5 percent of households in West Virginia had flood insurance.

Over the last five years, all 50 states have experienced floods. Worldwide, floods are the most costly natural disaster and have affected the largest number of people. Flood events are predicted to increase in frequency and/or severity in certain locations as the climate warms, requiring a new level of understanding and awareness about how communities and households can be more resilient.

Resilience—defined by a National Research Council report as “the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from and more successfully adapt to adverse events”—has become an objective at the federal government level with an executive order and multiple federal agencies all incorporating it as a goal for different policies and programs. State and local governments, too, are working to achieve resilient communities. Disaster insurance has a major role to play in promoting financial resilience to natural disasters.

Insurance for Resilience

Building on previous economic examinations of resilience, financial resilience to disasters can be seen as consisting of two dimensions. The first is the amount of damage sustained and the second is speed of recovery (see chart below). Insurance can improve both dimensions of financial resilience.

Insurance payouts speed recovery by making more funds available more quickly than relying on governmental disaster aid, which can often be quite limited and take months to years to make its way to victims. Insurance, by contrast, can fully reimburse homeowners (assuming adequate coverage levels) and do so relatively rapidly. In the case of Hurricane Katrina, households with flood insurance were 37 percent more likely to have rebuilt, according to a report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Insurance reduces the financial cost borne by the household by the amount of the insurance payment. Insureds, therefore, don’t need to use their savings or divert other spending to repair and rebuilding, lessening the financial toll of the disaster.

In addition, insurance can indirectly reduce damages by encouraging investments in risk reduction prior to a disaster through provision of risk information and/or through premium discounts for hazard mitigation.

In the end, however, insurance only creates household and community resilience against disasters if the people facing the hazard are insured. Unfortunately, around the world, many people are not insured against disasters. In the U.S., perhaps only 50 percent of people in areas at high risk of flooding are insured, and only 17 percent of those in California have earthquake insurance. In some other countries, there is an even greater gap between disaster damages and insured losses.

Improving Disaster Insurance

Three specific insurance policy designs can enhance resiliency. First, premiums charged should be related to risk. Disaster coverage is usually excluded from homeowners policies. Instead, government programs (or public-private partnerships) are often the providers of coverage. Some of these programs do not charge risk-based rates to all policyholders, dampening the risk information in the premium and not providing as much of an incentive for reducing risks. In the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), several groups of policyholders pay less than risk-based rates. Another example of policyholders paying below risk-based rates are some state wind pools. If premium affordability concerns justify discounts to encourage purchase of insurance, then the full risk rate should be reported to the policyholder.

Second, premium discounts should reward a wide array of risk reduction measures. The NFIP has been criticized for offering substantial premium reductions for elevation, but not for other flood mitigation measures. One challenge, though, is that many mitigation measures have high upfront costs. To date, financing arrangements (such as loans repaid through premium reductions) have been more of a theoretical possibility than a practical reality. A second challenge is the costs of monitoring. Years ago in Florida, the legislature mandated premium discounts for homes hardened against hurricanes, which resulted in widespread fraud and abuse undermined the program, a cautionary tale about implementation difficulties.

Third, insurance payments could be accelerated by moving away from indemnity-based insurance, which requires an adjuster to visit a property and assess damage. This takes processing time and there may be disputes and even litigation surrounding the payment. Delays may be worse after very large events with many claims to be handled. After Hurricane Sandy, for example, the National Flood Insurance Program was criticized for slow payments. One reason for the delay could have been too few adjusters. An alternative is parametric insurance, which is designed to make payments almost immediately. Although not typically used for homeowners coverage, parametric policies pay out when a predefined and objective “triggering event” occurs, such a certain category hurricane hitting a certain location.

Expanding purchase of insurance is most important. From West Virginia recently to Superstorm Sandy in New York, the one thing flooding disasters have made clear is that not enough people are insured. No matter the specifics of the insurance policy, to provide resiliency benefits, more people must be insured against disasters. Increasing coverage will require new and perhaps radical reforms in insurance offerings. One possibility is for a community to purchase flood insurance on behalf of its residents. Another possibility is to require bundling flood coverage into standard homeowners’ policies.

The challenge ahead is to make changes in insurance policy design to promote greater levels of uptake, whether the policies are sold by the public sector, private firms or in a partnership. One starting place may be greater advocacy for insurance as a tool for resiliency.","Fri, 29 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.brinknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/flooding_main-155000957-900x600.jpg,"['flood', 'role', 'disaster', 'financial', 'resilience', 'insured', 'coverage', 'premium', 'disasters', 'promoting', 'insurance', 'risk']", 
25,25,FL-2016-000075-BGD,Thousands rendered homeless - The Daily Star,https://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/thousands-rendered-homeless-1263241,"Rabeya Bewa, 65, a widow, and four of her family members took shelter on an embankment at Shiberkuti village in Lalmonirhat after their house went under water from the rising Dharla river about two weeks ago.

Having lost some 20kg rice, some pulse, firewood and part of their house in flooding, the poor family had to spend its entire savings in nine days.

“We did not get any relief material,” Rabeya told The Daily Star after returning home yesterday along with her son, daughter-in-law and two grandsons.

“Local union parishad chairman and members didn't visit us…we don't know why,” she said.

The main bread earner in her family is her son, a rickshaw van puller. He does not have enough work now.

“We borrowed Tk 1,200 which has to be repaid with interest. We are worried about the coming days,” she added.

Locals alleged some 50 families in the village were yet to receive any relief aid, reports our correspondent from Lalmonirhat.

Many flood-hit poor people in Lalmonirhat, Gaibandha, Nilphamari, Bogra, Jamalpur and Kurigram alleged they did not receive any relief supplies. Some others complained of receiving paltry relief.

The reports come when the water levels in the Brahmaputra, Jamuna, Ghaghat, Dharla, Surma and Kushiara continued to recede yesterday although all of them were flowing above their danger level.

Ripon Karmaker, assistant engineer at the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, said the water level in the Padma saw a slight rise.

“So there is a little chance for flooding in the south-central parts of the country in a week,” he told this newspaper.

“The monsoon rain in the country's northern region as well as in the Indian bordering states like Assam has been low, and the weather is likely to remain unchanged in next week. So there is no chance for deterioration in the overall flood situation,” he added.

NEW AREAS HIT

Some new areas in Manikganj and Munshiganj were inundated yesterday, forcing hundreds of people to leave their homes. Ferry services on the Shimulia-Kawrakandi route were under threat due to strong currents in the Padma.

Many affected people in the districts were facing shortage of jobs, food and cash. They also alleged that there was not enough relief aid.

In Gaibandha, about 150 families who took shelter on Ketkirhat Flood Control Dyke in Phulchari upazila were yet to get any relief materials. No elected public representative visited the flood-hit areas, victims complained.

“We would have to starve tomorrow [today] if we don't get relief supplies as our scanty food stock is exhausted,” said Khaibor Hossain, who has taken shelter on the dyke at Kalasona char in Phulchari.

Uriya Union Parishad Chairman Badiazzaman said the UP so far received a small supply of relief materials. The relief operation would start soon, he told The Daily Star.

Udakhali UP Chairman Anowar Hossain said they have sent requisitions to the local UNO for relief materials.

In Jamalpur, around 60 families moved to a flood shelter centre at Jarultala Govt Primary School in Islampur upazila. The victims passed nine days there without any relief materials, reports our correspondent.

According to the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, the government has allocated over Tk 1.10 crore, over 4,200 tonnes of gratuitous relief rice, dry food, saline and water purifying tablets to 14 flood-hit districts.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday in the cabinet meeting inquired of her cabinet colleagues about the relief operations. She instructed ministers, lawmakers and Awami League leaders to stand beside the flood victims, said meeting sources.

Disaster Management and Relief Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya said officials will face actions if they neglected their duties in distributing relief materials among the flood-hit people.

“We are supplying relief materials. No complaints have been received…we want that relief aid would reach victims in time,” he said while distributing relief items among flood victims at Gohaliapari of Kalihati upazila in Tangail.

The government would continue relief operations until the flood-affected people return home, added the minister.","Tue, 02 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/flood_1_5.jpg?itok=0znE8UR4,"['floodhit', 'flood', 'water', 'told', 'yesterday', 'victims', 'shelter', 'materials', 'thousands', 'upazila', 'rendered', 'relief', 'homeless']",

This is the beauty of the nature and the fortune of Pakistan as it is being blessed by so much diversified climate pattern round the year. In northern areas of Pakistan the temperature gets as low as 25 Celsius degree and in the southern areas of the country the temperature rises as high as 55 Celsius degree. Monsoon season is experienced in many parts of world for example northern Australia, Africa, and South America but the real strength of monsoon is being observed in South Asian countries which include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

Summer monsoon season in Pakistan is of great importance for its agricultural, economic and social purposes. These rains are not only used for water needs of plants in agricultural sector but also to kill the insects by physical beating. By irrigating the fields, certain insect pests like crickets attacking the cotton seedlings and the white ants attacking cotton, sugarcane, chilies and 0 other crops can be drowned in rain water and thus crops can be saved. Monsoon in Pakistan contributes almost 65-75 % of the total annual rainfall.

Monsoon is generally the blessing in the state as it reduces the water shortage and provides ample water to the dams for the generation of electricity which also improves the power shortage crisis in this state but due to bad governance and poor management; monsoon becomes devastating and destructive of the people of the country as poor drainage system plays the vital role in the water getting stuck on roads which spreads a lot of dangerous diseases and at the same time is also very unhygienic. Very poor conditions of the dams and river banks causes floods on regular basis in Pakistan in the monsoon season where high flow water destroys whatever comes its way resulting in heavy loss of both live and the property of the People living nearby river banks.

Monsoon rains and flood creates havoc in different parts of the flood-affected areas and leaves thousands of families affected. Large number of houses destroys, thousands of acres of ready to harvest crops and fruits orchards damages, link roads and bridges destroys.

Due to bad governance and poor drainage system widespread monsoon rains casts a negative impact on crops and affects the yield of cotton, chilli, banana and tomato in Mirpurkhas, Tharparkar, Sanghar, Badin, Degree and Hyderabad in Sindh.

When Monsoon hits Pakistan a large outbreak of diseases are reported in different parts of the country. It’s one of those problems that occur due to lack of preventive measures and lapses in our pre-planned structure. Monsoon usually spans in Pakistan from start of June until the end of August and throughout the months we hear about causalities and illnesses caused by rain and its after effects such as damming of water on roads, deaths due to electric shock, dengue outbreak, malaria, measles etc. Well, blame game is also at its peak in these days – media and newspapers are flooded with discussions based on someone should have done it; it’s not our responsibility and some similar lines like we are trying to help people who are in this condition.

Helen Keller once said, “Be of good cheer. Do not think of today’s failures, but of the success that may come tomorrow. You have set yourselves a difficult task, but you will succeed if you persevere; and you will find a joy in overcoming obstacles. Remember, no effort that we make to attain something beautiful is ever lost.”

But the question is “Is monsoon an unexpected condition to deal with?” I m 22 years old and since the last 10 years I have been listening about causalities occurring in this specific period. Same old repeated problems which are never considered or solved ending up by taking lives of thousands, leaving hundreds in need of emergency health facilities, and countless malnourished in a country where people don’t have enough money to fulfill their day to day needs. Now it’s time to stop blaming and start working in a practical manner so that we could improve our country.","Mon, 08 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://dailytimes.com.pk/static/uploads/original/monsoon-a-blessing-or-curse-for-pakistan-f7e62a94753de115f1d664c001f165a9.jpg,"['monsoon', 'water', 'roads', 'blessing', 'crops', 'degree', 'country', 'poor', 'thousands', 'curse', 'season', 'pakistan']",

Robbery is a common incident in the char areas during the rainy season. Most of the char areas go under floodwater. Robbers become active at that time as they can easily go from one place to another by engine-run boats.

The flood-affected people are compelled to take shelter on higher ground or flood control embankments with their belongings, including cattle.

Robbers attack the flood victims and loot their valuables.

At least six robberies had happened in different places of Kapasia, Sreepur and Haripur unions before the watchtowers were set up.

The criminals were committing the crime even in broad daylight, said locals of Kapasia union.

Considering the plight of the char people, Gaibandha-1 lawmaker Monjurul Islam Liton has financially helped the locals set up the watchtowers, each of which is 30-feet high, in the char areas of Kapasia and Haripur unions.

With their physical labour, locals have set up the towers. At least 10 people can stay on a tower at a time for observing movement of robbers' boats. They blow whistles to alert people if they see any such boat coming.

“We do our duties round the clock by rotation. At night, we run searchlights by using solar panels,"" said Mokbul Hossain, one of them who guards against robbery.

After setting up of the watchtowers, no robbery occurred here, said Somesh Ali of Haripur river ghat.

Locals said those towers somewhat relieved their anxiety over robbery.

Lawmaker Monjurul Islam gave the money from the Test Relief (TR) programme for setting up the two towers, said Nurunnabi Sarker, project implementation officer of Sundarganj upazila.

Construction of a permanent watchtower is costly. If a permanent watchtower is built, it will help reduce the incident of robbery in the char areas, said Mozharul Islam, chairman of Haripur union.","Wed, 10 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/watchtower.jpg?itok=Agifue7L,"['robbery', 'islam', 'watchtowers', 'areas', 'char', 'locals', 'watchtower', 'bamboomade', 'kapasia', 'set', 'check', 'haripur', 'towers']",

More than 180 flights were cancelled and hundreds rescheduled.

After battering the northern Philippines last weekend, with more than 275mm of rain falling over the town of Tuguegarao in 24 hours, Nida made landfall near Hong Kong Tuesday morning, rated as the equivalent of a category 1 hurricane. Thousands of people were evacuated from offshore oil rigs, as well as from construction sites, and headed to tunnels and bridges in the city. Hong Kong Observatory recorded 121mm of rain on Tuesday.

As Nida moved north-west away from Hong Kong and into mainland China it weakened to a severe tropical storm. However, due to the slow-moving nature of the storm, torrential rain triggered widespread flooding across south-west China, particularly in low lying regions.

Heavy rain over the weekend caused further damage to properties in Fort McMurray, in Alberta, Canada, following the wildfires that devastated parts of the region in May. It was reported that 85mm fell within two hours leading to localised flooding, road closures and power outages.

Meanwhile in south Asia dozens of people were killed by severe thunderstorms at the weekend. Heavy rain claimed the lives of nine citizens in Mumbai when a building collapsed, and it forced about 50,000 from their homes in southern and eastern India.

Lightning killed more than 50 people in Odisha, on the east coast of India. At the same time, in Bangladesh, 15 people were killed by lightning, and flooding took the lives of a further 17 people.

Here is his post:





This is not put up to stir up Chennai vs Bengaluru fight but to show the impact Chennai had during 2015 floods was of epic scale. It was not an one day Chennai rainfall in NEM that was so devastating. On November 8-9, Chennai Rainfall ranged around 100 -200 mm, on November 13, the rainfall ranged around 300-100 mm, on November 15-16, it was around 350 mm-200 mm, on November 23rd it was 150-100 mm. Finally on December 1st it was 500 - 300mm. Not once but for 5 days of deluge was Chennai 2015 history. No city can take this kind of rainfall. The spells were so intense all the time.





Comparison of Chennai and Bengaluru





Chennai has three Rivers cooum, Adyar, Kosasthalayar and a waterway called Buckingham canal connecting all three. And to complex things there is a major marshland and sea on the other side with tidal effect. It also has steep upstream and a flat city. No city in India has so many challenges in handling floods. Here is the rainfall of comparison of Chennai December 1st and Bengaluru 29th July Rainfall. Bengaluru city got 42 mm While Chennai city got 294 mm. Bengaluru AP got 71 mm while Chennai AP got 345 mm.





Conclusion

If Chennai rains happen in Bengaluru in future, it will cripple the city for weeks. If not for days. You have to understand the magnitude of rainfall which happened in and around Chennai. It has never happened before...One of the worst rains in Catchment of Areas of Adyar in 200 years.

I love Bengaluru tooo. But to be honest Chennai is better prepared to handle floods than Bengaluru....Its a hard truth all Bengalurians will accept.......Chennai daww.....! How effectively the flood was handled by the people of Chennai and the officials took steps to make sure there was no outbreak of disease.





Forecast





Bengaluru is going to see lots of dry days in coming days. Chennai too the same fate. But both Bengaluru and Chennai are expected to get rains today.

In a span of four days, the IT city has recorded over 135 mm of rainfall, which happens to be about 30 mm more than its monthly rainfall in July. Traffic too came to a crawl, with stranded motorists and broken-down vehicles, becoming a common sight across the city. The fire department used boats to rescue people who were stranded in the rain waters.","Mon, 01 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sify.com/uploads/qh3phzfabefia.jpg,"['bengaluru', 'chaos', 'rainfall', 'days', 'rains', 'chennai', 'rain', 'worst', 'stranded', 'mm', 'city', 'floods']",

Unlike the dried dates, yellow and red dates are usually eaten fresh or at least in the ripping stage and not in the final dried stage, said KG Murugavel, who has developed a date palm farm in Tirupur and exporting tonnes of hybrid variety of fresh dates (Barhi).

He said that there were many good things available in fresh dates. Nutrients, fibre and carbohydrates are present in fresh dates in rich than the dried dates. Since, it contains the taste of astringent, diabetic patients can eat the fruit.

By Megan Darby

The day of the 2016 Olympic opening ceremony in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the mood is jittery.

In the teeth of a recession and political crisis, the carnival city faces protests and health fears over the zika virus outbreak and polluted water.

It won’t stop half a million people showing up for two weeks of world class sporting drama.

Meanwhile, as part of a drive to get cities involved in climate action, Rio has filed a report on the threats posed by global warming.

Disclosed under the CDP cities programme, it makes for grim reading. Between the mountains and the coast, Rio is exposed to impacts from sea level rise and weather extremes that will intensify social and environmental pressures.

Zika, a mosquito-borne virus that causes birth defects, is the latest health threat to cause alarm.

Cases of dengue fever, chikungunya, leptospirosis and leishmaniosis are also expected to increase, as longer summers and more rainy days create the conditions for disease to spread.

Favelas clinging to steep hillsides or erected in wetlands on the outskirts of Rio are vulnerable to landslides or flooding.

In 2010, some 200 people were killed in a landslide following the heaviest rain in decades. The authorities estimate 20,000 families were living in high risk areas, of which they have since resettled 4,000.

Slum clearance brings its own tensions: “Resettling is a sensitive political issue because people are relocated to distant areas they are not familiar with and lose ties with their communities.”

And, the document warns, “larger and more frequent storms might increase the probability of landslides in areas already under risk”.

Rio’s famous beaches, too, are endangered. The sea level is rising at 3mm a year. It might not sound like much, but is expected to accelerate as ice caps and glaciers melt, while the ocean expands as it warms.

Planners are looking at a 0.5-1.5m rise by the end of the century, putting up to 125 square kilometres and 80,000 people at risk of coastal flooding. Urban beaches will lose sand and the non-urban beaches be reshaped by erosion.

“If the sea level rises 1 meter,” says the document, “which could happen in the next decades, it will threaten the lowlands of the West Zone, which concentrates most of the industries of the city.”

Olympic sailing venue Guanabara Bay is already polluted with sewage, prompting warnings to athletes not to swallow the water. Rising seas and intense rainfall will put further pressure on the sewerage system.

That is not an exhaustive list of the expected impacts of climate change. Drought and heatwaves also get a look-in.

It is the fifth year Rio has taken part in the CDP cities programme, so there are some coping strategies.

After the 2010 floods, it got nearly US$200 million from the federal government to protect the favelas from landslides.

The city is putting $5-10m of its own funds into early warning systems and around $10m apiece on flood defences and tree planting.

Last year, it contributed to heat mapping and sea level rise modelling projects through the C40 network of megacities.

As for reducing its contribution to the problem, Rio aims to go carbon neutral by 2065. Various energy efficiency, transport and waste policies aim to cut emissions 20% from 2005 levels by 2020.

Incidentally, the document criticises the national government for energy policies that reduce oil prices, which it says worsens congestion, air pollution and transport emissions.

What is clear is that one way and another, global warming will have a big impact in how Rio develops over the next few decades.","Fri, 05 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.climatechangenews.com/files/2016/08/8230665467_1742a36a1a_k-e1470398995442.jpg,"['rio', 'level', 'climate', 'rise', 'million', 'document', 'loss', 'landslides', 'janeiro', 'change', 'zika', 'global', 'city', 'decades', 'prepares', 'sea', 'expected', 'beach']", 
38,38,FL-2016-000075-BGD,Alexander's footprints - Dhaka Tribune,https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/heritage/2016/07/30/alexanders-footprints,"To paraphrase the famous British military anthem: Some talk of Alexander, and some of Megasthenes; of Ptolemy and Virgil, and such great names as these ... British grenadiers, of course, made their own military mark on the history of Bangladesh; and writers of the famous Roman and Greek classical period of Europe also made theirs. Writing, in some cases, over 2,000 years ago, they presented a reality of their age, of familiarity with the lands that are now those of Bangladesh. As well as of being as fascinating with perhaps even greater worldwide familiarity than today’s Bangladesh. How ironic, in the age of information. I wonder, in those ancient times, how often writers were asked, “Where is Gangaridai?” compared with how often I am asked today, “Where is Bangladesh?” There can, indeed, be little doubt that the educated, and especially, the traders and merchants, were familiar with not only Gangaridai, but also its location, and that of lands beyond. Deep into the Ganges basin, and north towards an inland city, called Thina, and the great difficulties in reaching it. However, the great Roman geographer late in the last century BCE, Strabo, writing in his famous work Geographia, comments: “Concerning those who sail from Egypt, even to the Ganges, they are but private citizens with no knowledge of the history of places they visit.” The earliest known example of academic snobbery. It was a much valued destination, of that there can be little doubt. Poets, historians, and businessmen of the half millennium, known as the “classical period” of European history, wrote about its location and both its trade and, it seems, especially the military prowess of its people. Prowess that always, inevitably throughout human history, has involved wealth. Even with all the aids, technology, and progress of modern archaeology, and advances that have facilitated a better appreciation of such significant places and events in pre-history, we continue to be unable to take any definitive view on periods and locations of the emerging -- we might say -- embryonic, modern, commercially-based civilisation, that certainly emerged in these lands of Bangladesh over two millennia ago. Even the duration of the Kingdom of Gangaridai, if kingdom it was, is hazy. Was it a kingdom? Archaeological development of appreciation of the very early Harappan civilisation further west suggests an absence of mansions and palaces in urban sites, which to some archaeologists suggests that some form of true democracy was an early form of governance. Around histories of Vanga, Magadha, and Mauryan periods swirl such questions; perhaps only Megasthenes’ commentary of the Aleaxandrian invasion goes some way towards offering a definite period within the history of Gangaridai. Modern politics also thickens the swirling mists of time that have left us with dateable sites and artefacts, but no certainties. Gangaridai, we are told, were a people dwelling on the east side of the Ganges. Knowing as we do, the mobility of river courses in the Gangetic plains, even that fails to locate with certainty. Naturally, India, recognising the inevitability of archaeological and historical definition of the existence and significance, of Gangaridai internationally, have laid claim to a capital city close to Calcutta. Since that is a fringe of the delta, it seems an improbable claim. Within the lands of the delta, one modern claim is made for a location of the capital at Gopalganj; others suggest the site, with its 5km rampart on the banks of the Old Brahmaputra at Wari Bateshwar; or even Egarosindur, a largely unexplored site at Kishoreganj. Of Gangaridai however, we have early writers to thank for our certainty that it not only existed, but was, in its time, internationally significant, as a major crossroads of international trade and commerce. Megathenes was a traveller, born in modern Turkey, who arrived in the city of Pataliputra (modern Patna), capital of both Magadha and later, Mauryan Empires. Those who believe that Chandragupta, the first of the Mauryan Emperors, built the east/west Grand Trunk Road may well be as confused as historians seem to be about times and places, since Megasthenes is said to have arrived at Pataliputra along the “great” highway. Surely the Grand Trunk Road is said to have been constructed by Chandragupta? Or, perhaps, simply following the footprints of Alexander? However, it appears that he arrived there shortly after the failure of Alexander and his army to cross the Ganges, a crossing that -- it may be reasonable to suppose, across a wide river, perhaps in flood -- beyond which it was intended to seize the wealth of the flourishing trading centre with the lands of Gangaridai. Every army sought financial rewards for their endeavours, and Alexander’s was, certainly, no exception. Whilst most of the great writers of Alexander’s endeavour, over the subsequent seven or eight hundred years, write of his eventual failure, his military achievements before his death at the age of 32 still resonate down the centuries. Focusing on military issues, there are also mercantile and geographical commentaries that confirm the importance for perhaps as much as nearly a millennium, of Gangaridai, to a wider world. The world map, produced in the late 3rd century BCE by Eratosthenes, is remarkable for the evidently detailed knowledge of the Ganges and its major tributaries, such as Jamuna. Such maps reveal very evident sources of information, and familiarity with such destinations. Similarly, Strabo also shows great familiarity with the delta and its components in both his commentaries and cartography. The publication of mid 1st century CE, Periplus of the Erythaean Sea, a merchants guide to trade, not only provides detailed instructions for approaching the delta, but also prime items for trade. And, of course, Ptolemy, the great mid 2nd century CE cartographer, whose detailed sources for his remarkably accurate maps of the known world made his own map of the deltaic lands, with remarkable accuracy; including the mark of a settlement called Ramcu, exactly where Ramu stands, today. But it is the military historians that throw the most revealing light onto to sheer strength, in population numbers, military resources, and evidently, wealth that we may reasonably suppose derived from manufacturing and trade of the deltaic lands. The earliest writer, describing the military strength of Gangaridai, was of course Megasthenes, writing with the benefit of his experience of the geography; and, certainly familiarity around Patna, of those who could recall the circumstances of Alexander’s advance. He describes a River Ganges, that faced Alexander’s army, at least eight miles wide and 20 at its maximum, and an estimated 100 feet deep. The forces assembled to resist any attempt by Alexander to make a crossing, comprised, he wrote of 1,000 horses (interesting, considering horses were not native, and over subsequent centuries, until recent times, originated in Bhutan), 700 elephants, and 60,000 infantry (“in apparatus of war”). Diodorus Siculus, a Roman historian, writing in the second half of the last century BCE, may well have derived some of his information from Megasthenes. However, his estimate of assembled forces were far greater. “An army of 20,000 horses, 200,000 infantry, 2,000 chariots, and 4,000 elephants trained and equipped for war.” All subsequent historians agree that the forces of Gangaridai had by far the largest number of war elephants in India. A very clear comment on the wealth and prowess of the military might of the “kingdom.” More of them also increase the estimate of numbers; Quintus Curtius Rufus, Plutarch, and Pliny the Elder, as, like most Romans, great admirers of Alexander, may well have considered that only unbelievable geographic and military hurdles could possibly have daunted Alexander and his army. They, and others, such as the 3rd century Dionysius Periegetes, add geographic descriptions to their writing of what was for centuries regarded as the edge of the known world. Even Ptolemy’s usually accurate mapping fails at mapping territories beyond east and south-east of the lands of Bangladesh. For them, it seems, Alexander did in fact march to the ends of the known world, only to be confronted by unsurpassable obstacles to further advance. Indeed might the old song go, “Some talk of Alexander,” it was unquestionably the ill-fated attempt by Alexander to conquer the peoples and lands that are now Bangladesh to add to his, hitherto, unparalleled adventure in international conquest, that opened the ancient, early worldwide awareness of these lands of Bangladesh. To the successful rebuff by nature, and the power and courage of the peoples themselves, we owe such knowledge that has put early times in the lands of Bangladesh into the ancient history of world civilisation, and well as on some of the earliest maps of the world.","Sat, 30 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2016/08/heritage_2_0.jpg,"['history', 'modern', 'alexanders', 'great', 'bangladesh', 'lands', 'military', 'ganges', 'alexander', 'gangaridai', 'footprints', 'world']",

“For lack of available grass and the high price of substitutes like hay, oilcake and wheat bran I had to sell some of my cows,” says Mafur Ali from Chandpur village in Sylhet's Fenchuganj upazila.

“Due to their poor diet at present many cows have fallen ill.”

“Cow milk is my only income source,” says Monohor Ali from Pushainagor village in Moulvibazar's Kulaura upazila. “These days I am facing a serious crisis in finding pasture. I have been trying to manage my cattle by collecting water hyacinth, but I think in the coming week I'll have to sell some since so much pasture has been damaged and submerged by the floods.”

Ramjan Ali from nearby Bhuksimuil village is in a similar situation. “My two acres are underwater,” he says, “Most of the grass available for livestock is damaged. In the last two days of April from three cows I could produce twelve litres of milk; but from May my cattle only produce about three litres every few days.” Milk is Ramjan's main income source; and several other local dairy producers spoke of similar difficulties.

Yet water flow from the hills and continuing rainfall is further raising the level of the haor and submerging greater portions of pasture across the affected Juri, Kulaura and Barlekha upazilas in Moulvibazar and Fenchuganj and Osmaninagar upazilas in Sylhet.

“I took a loan during Ramadan month to buy two cows,” says Bodrul Hosain from Bhuaimil village in Juri upazila. “Now I am in financial crisis since the cows' milk production is decreased from a lack of available pasture for them; and I can't make the loan repayments as they become due.”

Hay seller Moin Uddin Chowdhury, from Kathaltoli Bazar in Fenchuganj meanwhile, finds his hay in great demand. The selling rate for hay has increased substantial since last month.

Divisional deputy director of the livestock department Dr. Achintya Kumar Saha says many in the haor area rely on small-scale cattle rearing, for either milk or meat, for their livelihoods. He says he has informed higher authorities concerning the problems they are experiencing due to the floods.

In addition to the needs of livestock, residents too are suffering from a crisis of both clean drinking water and food.","Wed, 10 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/a_man_on_a_boat_collects_water.jpg?itok=yusfpbZv,"['milk', 'pasture', 'haor', 'water', 'crisis', 'areas', 'livestock', 'hay', 'fodder', 'village', 'cows', 'upazilas']",

The city planning commission will consider a request by the group Levees.org for a permit to preserve the house at a meeting on Aug. 9, according to group founder Sandy Rosenthal. She said the house is likely the closest left standing near any of the three spots where levees broke, pouring water into the city.

The one-story brick house is still vacant, with gaping holes in a back wall and roof.

Rosenthal says she wants the exterior to look as it did just after the city was pumped dry, with a re-creation of a moldy, flood-upturned living room visible through the front windows.

Glenn Corbett, a New York fire safety professor who testified before the congressional 9/11 commission, said in a phone interview that he believes the project is “an incredibly valuable thing and unique. Nobody’s done this.”

Corbett, who suggested the project to Rosenthal, said that as far as he knows, this will be the first time someone has preserved “a piece of disaster history … so people can look at it, get close to it, see what happened.”

Corbett said that after 9/11, many people assumed that the only parts of the World Trade Center remaining above ground — three crazily leaning sections of facade and exterior beams — would be stabilized in place as part of a memorial. Instead, he said, the 8-acre site was swept clean.

Rosenthal’s group, created to push for reforms in levee building and oversight, also has had plaques installed at the levee breaches and created a memorial garden in the vacant lot next door to the one-story brick house which she bought in April.

“We cannot squander the opportunity to preserve this relic, this insight,” she said at a news conference in front of the one-story brick house, still vacant 11 years after the storm.

Bangladeshi Police confirmed on Thursday that a dual British-Bangladeshi national, Hasanat Karim, has been arrested in connection with the siege. Officers previously questioned 35-year-old Hasanat Karim, who moved from the country to Britain as a teenager, after he was released by the sick jihadis after being held hostage. Arrested alongside the engineer is 22-year-old University of Toronto student, Tahmid Khan. Khan is said to be a Bangladeshi citizen, but was on leave from university. A.K.M Shahidur Rahman, a police spokesman in Dhaka, said: ""We can confirm that they were arrested under Section 54 of CrPC (criminal procedure)."" He was referencing a law under which police can detain someone for suspicion over any crime. Both men are said to have been inside the cafe when the attackers struck, with Karim's family claiming he was used as a human shield. Police are said to be seeking court permission to question the pair for 10 days.

It is claimed the pair have not been seen in public since the attack. Speaking from London, Karim's lawyer, Rodney Dixon, claimed his client was being held at a secret location in Bangladesh. He added the 47-year-old was being questioned without a lawyer present. He said: ""He cannot be kept incommunicado in detention. He must have access to his lawyers while he is being questioned. ""They should release him immediately since there is no evidence of his involvement in any crime.

""There is absolutely no evidence that he was the ring leader or involved in any way in the attack."" The British High Commission confirmed their requests to access Karim had also been denied. The Holey Artisan Bakery in the capital, Dhaka, turned into a bloodbath after seven gunman stormed the building on July 1, allegedly shouting ""alluha akbar'. In a 12-hour stand-off with police the Isis, otherwise known as Islamic State, fighters murdered 20 people to death, including two police officers.

At least 30 other officers were reported wounded in the stand-off. Harrowing reports from hostages claimed that those who could not recite the Koran were tortured before being gunned down. Reports suggest Karim was made to recite the first chapter of the Koran before being released. Mostly foreign citizens died in the attack including nine Italians, seven Japanese, two Bangladeshis, an Indian and a US citizen. Three students studying in America were also among the dead. Two Emory University students, Abinta Kabir and Faraaz Hossain, died in the attack.

US national Ms Kabir, from Miami, Florida, was visiting friends and family in the country, while Mr Hossain was originally Bangladeshi national. And UC Berkely student Tarushi Jain, 19, an Indian national, was confirmed dead by India's external affairs minister. Reports suggest around 30 people were taken hostage at the cafe popular with foreigners, in the city's diplomatic district, armed with handguns, assault weapons, knives, and other 'sharp objects'.

Brutal photos from inside the building were released by the twisted group, showing the cafe awash with blood with victims' bodies strewn across the floor. Isis later posted images of the alleged murderers who carried out the brutal attack smiling and posing with weapons.

Environmental risk comprises a broad range of issues and threats—many of which don’t immediately come to mind for business executives, even though they are always looming in the background.

Over the last few decades, concerns about increased energy production, threats to food and water security, and rising sea levels have put climate change on the minds of policymakers and executives. Even man-made risks like deforestation have significant implications. All of these risks carry potential consequences for corporations and risk management professionals, from dealing with business interruptions to building resilient supply chains.

Here is a recap of BRINK’s five top stories about environmental risk, ranging from the energy effectiveness of ‘green buildings’ to mounting dangers of coastal flooding for the world’s megacities.

The international agreement reached at the climate change summit (COP21) in Paris last year was a milestone achievement for setting the international agenda for minimizing global warming. The agreement established an ambitious timeline for curbing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels.

Many environmentalists hailed the agreement, but significant barriers remain for the international community to meet its rigorous goal—such as the continued dependency on coal technologies to supply power to the world’s poorest populations.

“Hampering the global deployment of Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) and High-Efficiency/Low-Emissions (HELE) coal technologies runs the risk of increasing the cost of mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,” writes Janet Gellici, CEO of the National Coal Council.

Capturing, storing, and using CO2 emitted into the atmosphere is a tremendous challenge, according to Gellici, but advanced technologies like CCS can help mitigate these potential issues. Neglecting to embrace advanced coal technologies, however, “risks a failure to meet our climate objectives.”

About 40 percent of U.S. primary energy use results from commercial and residential buildings, which means energy-efficient buildings will be an important factor for reducing energy use in the future. But are today’s “green buildings” making much of an impact?

“There isn’t enough data available to indicate that, on average, green buildings save more energy than conventional buildings,” writes John H. Scofield, professor of physics at Oberlin College. “At best these green buildings perform no better and no worse on primary energy savings” compared to traditional buildings.

With the government requiring the construction of green buildings and the pressing need to lower energy use, Scofield’s conclusion is a tough pill to swallow. But for green buildings to make an impact, their effectiveness—and the potential need for improvement—must first be fully considered.

The maritime industry landscape has long had three pillars: shipping, fishing, and offshore drilling. But a “new ocean economy” is on the horizon, and with it comes the potential for innovation, job-growth and—of course—risk.

The new ocean economy includes industries such as offshore wind, tidal, and wave energy; oil and gas exploration and production in ultra-deep water and exceptionally harsh environments; marine tourism; and marine biotechnology.

“But these maritime activities are unlikely to develop their full potential without effective management of the risks associated with them,” writes Barrie Stevens, head of the international futures program for OECD. “The most appropriate way to manage both the economic and environmental risks is better management of the ocean space.”

In recent years, flooding from storm surges has posed an increasing risk to coastal cities. In 2013, for example, floods caused the largest amount of insured losses out of any global disaster. With approximately 70 million people moving to cities every year, population in coastal flood zones is expected to increase 25 percent by 2050. Yet there are trillions of dollars in assets in flood zones across the world without adequate protections.

Watch this BRINK video interview with Erwann Michel-Kerjan, executive director of the Wharton Risk Center, as he discusses his in-depth analysis of flood mitigation strategies and different policy solutions for protecting flood-prone areas.

The world loves chocolate: Every year, we consume close to 3 million tons of cocoa products. Cocoa production had a global market valued at around $100 billion in 2015, and the industry employs between 5 and 6 million farmers.

But don’t be fooled—cocoa is in crisis.

“The cocoa industry will not survive in its current form,” writes Jason Clay, executive director of the markets institute at the World Wildlife Fund. Due to declining productivity, stagnating wages for cocoa farmers, and threats resulting from climate change, he argues, the cocoa industry is well beyond its peak production days.

The industry, however, can still revitalize itself—and Clay thinks cooperation will play a key role.

“The question,” Clay asks, “is whether the industry can work together to revitalize itself in time.”","Tue, 09 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.brinknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/stevens_ocean_main-183078555-900x600.jpg,"['writes', 'potential', 'environment', 'green', 'brinks', 'buildings', 'global', 'risks', 'energy', 'industry', 'cocoa', 'risk']",

About four thousand people cross the canal, a branch of the Dudhkumar River, daily by boat for the last few days after the 100-foot-long bridge on the canal collapsed.

“The bridge constructed in 1993 was the only means of communication between seven unions of the upazila and the district headquarters, had been in dilapidated condition for over five years. It was totally damaged by the last flood,” said local Jehar Uddin, 38.

Kaliganj Union Parishad Chairman Nur Islam said, “About three lakh people of Motherganj, Kachakata, Narayanpur (partial), Balloverkhas, Noonkhawa (partial), Kedar, Berubari (partial) and Kaliganj unions would use the bridge.”

After its collapse, about 40 kilometres of alternative roads are being used for transportation and communication, he added.

He said he, earlier, informed the upazila nirbahi officer and local lawmaker several times that the bridge may collapse any time as it had become loose. But no action was taken.

Badsha Alamgir, upazila engineer of the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED), said the Monnearpar bridge is not under LGED, it is under Roads & Highways Department (RHD).

RHD Executive Engineer ABM Khurshid Alam said the main road, part of Bhurungamari-Sonahat-Madarganj-Bhitarband-Nageswari road, is under their department but the bridge is situated around 100 metres from the main road which takes a U-turn to the east. Khurshid said they would now take steps to construct a new bridge as Hafizur Rahman, additional chief engineer of RHD in Rangpur, visited the area on August 4.","Wed, 10 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/nageswari_upazila.jpg?itok=fKCeRy9p,"['collapses', 'monnearpar', 'local', 'department', 'canal', 'bridge', 'road', 'engineer', 'partial', 'upazila', 'unions', 'suffer']", 
44,44,FL-2016-000075-BGD,A Tide of Immigrants in the UK's Birmingham - The Asia Sentinel,https://www.asiasentinel.com/p/immigrants-uk-birmingham,"The television news has just broken the news of the murder of 86-year-old French priest Father Jacques Hamel while he was saying Mass. I walk outside to one of the main commercial streets in central Birmingham.

A man walks over; around his waist is a banner reading “Ask Me about Islam.” “Can I interest you in books about our religion?” he says. I am speechless at this public evangelization of Islam on the streets of Britain’s second city.

We walk into the Bullring, the main commercial center. The brands are those you find in most cities in Europe – Zara, Samsung, Nike and Adidas But, as you walk around, you are unsure which country you are in. Some women wear burqas, others cover their bodies but not their faces, wearing elegant scarves over their heads; there are Arabs, blacks, Slavs and Asians, including many from the Indian subcontinent. You hear many languages, most of whom I do not recognise.

According to the 2011 census, Birmingham had a population of 1 million, of whom British whites accounted for 58 percent, one of the lowest proportions of any large city in the UK. Those of Asian origin accounted for 27 per cent, including 13.5 percent from Pakistan, 3 percent from India and Bangladesh respectively and 1.2 percent from China.

This flood of foreign faces was the reason why 17 million British people, or 52 percent of those who voted, chose to leave the European Union in the referendum on June 23. In Birmingham, 50.4 percent voted for Brexit, a margin of 3,800 votes.

“The numbers are too great and our island is too small,” said John Waite, who sells shoes in a city center shop. “That is why I voted no. Many of the first and second generation cannot speak English. How can I communicate with them? Why do they not wish to assimilate?”

“I voted to leave out of a concern that the influx of people at the current volume is outstripping the rate at which Britain is able to build more houses and expand public services,” wrote G. Lanham in a letter to the Birmingham Post on Aug. 1. “I suggest a suspension of immigration for a short, limited period, to allow our government to take stock and appraise the entire immigration policy.”

Taxi driver David Whelan said: “there will be a war between us and the Muslims. Some of them want to assimilate, others do not. They hide their women behind burqas and say our women are sluts who show their bodies. We do not want them here. If they want to live like that, they should go back to their own country. Britain is going back to the country it was in the time of Charles Dickens. We are losing the social protections we have developed since World War Two.”

Many “No” voters see a direct link between immigration and the threat of terrorism. “Extremists, fanatics, lunatics are trying to come here to England and the policies and dictates of the EU are permitting, nay encouraging them to succeed,” wrote JB Greenberg in a letter to the Birmingham Post on Aug. 1. “The open-door policy of the EU is nothing more than a recipe for total disaster.”

On July 31, police in the West Midlands announced they had released 90 “suspected slavery victims.” They had been brought in trucks and coaches legally from Poland and Romania and held as prisoners, forced to work for long hours for very little pay.

“People of Southeast Asian heritage are also trafficked here to work in cannabis factories in squalid, dangerous conditions,” the police said.

Residents complain that many of those arriving from Eastern Europe, with large families, are given preference in limited public housing, ahead of local people who have waited for several years. They are said to enjoy free medical care and education, putting a heavy burden on schools and hospitals already stretched to the limit by government spending cuts.

The Brummies – Birmingham residents – from the Indian sub-continent find themselves trapped in the middle of the debate. Many have been here for two or three generations, with the first arriving after WWII when Britain had a shortage of labor and welcomed them to work in factories, building sites and service jobs. The families are well assimilated, with some of the third generation entering the professions like the law, medicine, engineering and the civil service.

So while they are “Asian,” they understand well the feelings of their fellow whites as they see the flood of migrants from eastern Europe and Africa. Mohammad Sadiq, a taxi driver of Pakistani origin, voted “Remain” because his business depends on many foreign visitors. If they need visas, fewer will come.

“My father came here as a migrant and worked very hard. He did not take welfare. He later set up two restaurants that are still in the family. I was born here and most of my family is here. I rarely go to Pakistan. The worst scroungers are Romanians and Somalis. They do not like to work. They take public welfare, they beg, they drink and they smoke. The Romanians come to your home, open the gate and go through the rubbish, to take things they want,” he said.

Asked about the killings of IS, he said: “we hate these killings as much as you do. If I could give my life to stop them, I would. These people are not Muslims. The Quran tells us that, if you see an ant crossing the road, you pick it up and put it to one side, to prevent it being killed.”

His colleague, Mohan Ram, of Indian origin, said that he also voted “Remain” for the same reason but was nervous of the future. “Migrants target Britain because its welfare and benefits are the most generous in Europe and it speaks English. There are Romanians and Somalis who have Dutch passports. Also there are many Afghans, Indians and Pakistanis who stay in Italy for several years, get Italian passports and then come. They will continue to come until the Brexit negotiations are completed.

“How many more people can this island take – another 20 million?”

45,45,FL-2016-000075-BGD,Eyes on top militants - The Daily Star,https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/eyes-top-militants-1263733,"Police yesterday declared cash rewards for information leading to the arrest of two persons, saying they were behind the recent terror attacks and targeted killings in Bangladesh.

Tamim Ahmed Chowdhury, a Canadian citizen of Bangladeshi origin, masterminded the Gulshan and Sholakia attacks, while sacked army major Syed Ziaul Haq had a hand in the targeted killings, said Inspector General of Police (IGP) AKM Shahidul Hoque.

“We believe we will be able to curb militant activities once we bring them under the purview of law,” he said at a press briefing at the police headquarters while announcing a Tk 20 lakh reward for information on each of them.

If any person provides police with the information, his or her identity would not be disclosed, assured the police chief.

He also said law enforcers would provide legal assistance to anyone who wants to leave the path of militancy and return to normal life.

In 2005, the government had announced Tk 50 lakh bounty each for the arrest of Abdur Rahman and Siddiqul Islam alias Bangla Bhai -- top leaders of banned militant outfit Jamaat-ul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB).

Gunmen stormed the Holey Artisan Bakery in the capital's Gulshan diplomatic zone on this July 1 and killed 20 hostages, mostly foreign nationals. Two police officials were also killed during the 12-hour hostage standoff.

In Kishoreganj, four people, including a suspected attacker, were killed in a militant attack near the Sholakia Eid congregation ground on July 7, the Eid day.

TAMIM

Tamim Ahmed Chowdhury is a top JMB leader and police investigation found his involvement in the Gulshan and Sholakia terror attacks, said the IGP.

He had also guided the group of nine militants, killed in a recent police operation at Kalyanpur, into planning further attacks, he said.

Shahidul said police were not sure whether Tamim is in the country right now.

However, he claimed that they have identified two key associates of Tamim and were working to arrest them.

Tamim, an accused in the case filed with Mirpur Police Station over the Kalyanpur incident, came under law enforcers' radar last year although he entered the country in a flight from Dubai on October 5 in 2013, said police.

He used to frequent the militant den in Kalyanpur and have meetings with the militants and give them motivational speeches, according to the case statement.

Tamim and other accused in the case also provided the 9 militants with financial support, firearms, ammunition and explosives, the case statement said, adding that the accused also trained the radicals.

Investigators believe Tamim is leading a pro-Islamic State (IS) group in Bangladesh. The IS mouthpiece Dabiq magazine says Tamim identifies himself as Shaykh Abu Ibrahim Al-Hanif, the ""Amir of the Khilafah's Soldiers in Bengal.""

However, the government rules out any organisational presence of IS in Bangladesh.

Tamim in a Dabiq issue reportedly claimed that a section of Shibir, the student front Jamaat-e-Islami, is also working for his group in Bangladesh.

Born on July 25 in 1986, Tanim is from Borogram Sadimapur village under Dubag union of Sylhet's Beanibazar upazila, according to the police headquarters.

Tamim's father Shafi Ahmed Chowdhury, who was a shipping officer in Chittagong, moved to Canada along with his family after the liberation war in 1971. Before the 2013 visit, Tamim along with his family came to Bangladesh in 2001 and stayed for around three months.

Tamim's cousin Tazim Ahmed Chowdhury said Tanim is married and has three children.

According to the international media, Tamim was previously a resident of Windsor, Ontario in Canada. He is in his mid-30s. A few people knew him from the local mosque and from the social circles. He was a shy and skinny kid.

Abdus Salam, chairman of Dubag union, said Tamim's family is associated with Jamaat politics and his late grandfather Abdul Majid Chowdhury was a “helping hand” of a Peace Committee, an anti-liberation force, during the 1971 Liberation War, reports our Sylhet correspondent.

ZIA

At yesterday's press briefing, the IGP said police investigation also found the involvement of sacked army major Syed Ziaul Haque in recent targeted killings of individuals.

Son of Syed Md Zillul Haque, Zia is from Mostafapur of Moulvibazar Sadar upazila.

According to police sources, Zia is the key operational commander of the pro-Qaeda outfit called Ansar Al Islam which was previously known as Ansarullah Bangla Team.

Zia made headlines in 2012 while trying to engineer a military coup that failed.

Ansar Al Islam claimed responsibility for some of the targeted killings of secularist writers, bloggers and gay rights activists.

Around 200 of its trained members are active in the country to execute the plans of Zia, detectives say, based on the statements of some of its arrested members.

Zia has been dodging police dragnet since 2012.

Chief of Counterterrorism and Transnational Crime unit of Dhaka Metropolitan Police Monirul Islam said Zia is currently inside the country.

Among the members of his group, Zia is known as Sagar and Ishtaq.

Arrested Ansar Al Islam member Suman Hossain Patwari said he along with several other members was trained up at a centre in Tongi which was visited by Sagar alias Ishtaq, said police.

Suman has confessed his involvement in the attack on Shuddhoswar Publication owner Ahmedur Rashed Chowdhury Tutul on October 31 last year, police added.","Wed, 03 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/zia_5.jpg?itok=LPkxe6k3,"['killings', 'islam', 'case', 'eyes', 'group', 'militant', 'killed', 'tamim', 'zia', 'chowdhury', 'targeted', 'militants']", 
46,46,FL-2016-000075-BGD,The Swachh Bharat Mission may just trip up Bihar’s fledgling ecological sanitation movement - Scroll.in,https://scroll.in/article/812385/the-swachh-bharat-mission-may-just-trip-up-bihars-fledgling-ecological-sanitation-movement,"At 25.1%, the state of Bihar has the lowest toilet coverage in India. This means only a quarter of Bihar’s total population of 10.4 crore has access to toilets. The remaining 75% defecates in the open, causing both health problems and environmental degradation.

Under the Swachh Bharat Mission-Gramin, both the Government of India and the state government are making concerted efforts to increase toilet coverage in Bihar. However, the lack of focus on ecological sanitation and contractor-driven toilet construction targets is hurting the sanitation sector.

Technologically speaking, there are various options for household sanitation. These include the simple pit latrine, pour flush latrine, soak-pit and those that run on the septic tank system.

However, in recent years, the concept of ecological sanitation has gained ground in the country. Commonly known as ecosan, this concept is based on the principles of recycling.

In such toilets, human excreta and urine are separated at the source to be later used as fertiliser in agricultural fields. A flush of water is not required; at the most a minimal amount of wash water is required. Thus, an ecosan toilet not only saves water and reduces the risk of groundwater contamination (conventional underground soak-pits often leak or overflow), it also reuses nutrients in faeces and urine to boost crop production and reduces consumption of chemical fertilisers.

North Bihar has abundant surface water sources and a shallow groundwater table (2-5 metres below the ground level). It also faces frequent floods, as 73% of the state (mostly North Bihar) is flood prone.

Ecosan toilets are particularly useful in such areas.

“Shallow groundwater table and frequent floods means high risk of groundwater contamination due to human excreta stored in the underground soak-pits of conventional latrines,” said Eklavya Prasad, managing trustee of Megh Pyne Abhiyan, a public charitable trust working on water and sanitation issues in North Bihar. “Also, during floods, the conventional flush toilets are rendered useless as flood water enters the pits and chokes the system.”

Groundwater contamination is a major concern in Bihar because groundwater is the primary source of drinking water.

In order to promote ecological sanitation, Megh Pyne Abhiyan has tied up with Water Action, a Pashchim Champaran-based Non-Governmental Organisation, to promote ecosan toilets in rural areas of the district where overall toilet coverage is mere 24.7%.

“We are promoting ecosan toilets in the villages of Pashchim Champaran,” said Vinay Kumar, secretary of Water Action. “But, competing with free, conventional pit toilets being constructed under the Swachh Bharat Mission is turning out to be a big challenge.”

Floods and ecosan toilets

The floods of 2008-’09 introduced the concept of ecosan toilets in North Bihar. “During the floods, villagers were openly defecating barely 10 feet away from the drinking water handpumps,” reminisced Kumar, who was carrying out flood-relief works in Nautan block of Pashchim Champaran at that time. “We realised the need of providing sanitation facilities to the flood-affected population.”

In 2007, Kumar had attended a workshop on ecosan toilets in Khagaria district of North Bihar where sanitation experts from Bengaluru trained local Non-Governmental Organisations on ecosan toilets.

Kumar decided to implement the idea during the 2008-’09 floods.

“On a slightly raised platform, we constructed 10 makeshift ecosan toilets using two-hole pan and an empty Dalda ghee plastic container,” explained Kumar. “Faeces were collected in large Dalda ghee container whereas urine was collected separately in a large bottle using a pipe.”

After the floods, when people moved back to their villages, they dismantled the ecosan toilets and carried the materials with them to reconstruct the toilets.

The niche for ecosan toilets had thus been created.

Based on local conditions and community feedback, Megh Pyne Abhiyan designed a unique ecosan toilet called Phaydemand Shauchalay (beneficial or productive toilet), particularly meant for the flood prone areas of North Bihar.

Phaydemand Shauchalay

On an average, the faecal matter and urine one human being produces every year contains 4.6 kg nitrogen, 0.6 kg phosphorous and 1.3 kg potassium, the three main nutrients in commercial fertilisers. From these nutrients, 250 kg of rice can be produced annually, reads Megh Pyne Abhiyan’s manual on Phaydemand Shauchalay.

The basic design of a Phaydemand Shauchalay includes two specially-designed ecosan toilet pans placed above two concrete chambers, which are constructed above ground level, on a raised platform, to account for floods. Each pan has a 10-inch diameter space in the centre, which leads to the chambers below, where the faeces are collected. Sloping away from this open space are two basins at the front and back with their own drainage. The basin at the front collects urine, while the one at the back drains out the water used for cleaning.

After defecating, the user needs to sprinkle two spoons of ash or sawdust on the faeces and close the lid of the excreta hole. Not even a drop of wash water or urine should get inside the excreta chambers. This prevents insect attack, and there is absolutely no bad odour.

For the first five to six months, the family uses one chamber only. Once the first chamber is filled, it is sealed, and the fecal matter naturally decomposes into manure in three to four months. During this time, the family switches to using the second chamber for defecation. Once ready, the humanure is harvested by family members and used in the fields. The urine, which is collected in a separate container, is mixed with water and sprinkled in the fields.

“We ensure that before constructing Phaydemand Shauchalay, the community is educated about ecological sanitation and the proper use of an ecosan toilet,” said Prasad.

In order to address the threat of floods, Megh Pyne Abhiyan and Water Action carry out village-based studies to mark flood water levels of the last 10 years. “Based on the 10 years data, we decide the height of the toilet, which is always built on a raised platform to ensure flood waters do not enter the excreta chambers,” said Kumar. Local villagers have also been trained to make pre-cast standardised Phaydemand Shauchalay pans.

A young ecosan warrior

In early 2012, after securing a Bachelor of Arts degree, 21-year-old Vinita Kumari, a resident of Poorvi Tola, Rupaulia panchayat in Gaunaha block, enrolled herself with the Indira Gandhi National Open University for a Master of Arts degree via correspondence. Kumari, the fourth of five girls, also decided to take charge of her family’s farmland.

Around the same time, Kumar was regularly visiting Poorvi Tola to educate villagers about ecological sanitation. The hamlet did not have even a single toilet at the time and all the 37 households were practicing open defecation.

After a long community mobilisation programme, the construction of Phaydemand Shauchalay started in the village in April 2012. The cost of construction of one such toilet was about Rs 8,000-Rs 9,000. Water Action raised money from Public Health Engineering Department (funds and donor assistance). The balance amount of Rs 1,000-Rs 1,500 came from the user families.

While the construction of Phaydemand Shauchalay were underway, Vinita Kumari started taking a keen interest in ecosan technology. She also gave useful suggestions on toilet design to Water Action. However, convincing her own family members to construct a Phaydemand Shauchalay wasn’t easy.

“My father and his brother were against the idea of harvesting excreta and urine,” reminisced Kumari. “They thought it was a menial job. I assured them I will harvest humanure and use it in the fields.”

By December 2012, 31 Phaydemand Shauchalay were ready for use in Poorvi Tola, one of them belonged to Kumari’s family. And, on May 1, 2013, she formally joined Water Action as an ecosan warrior.

Eco-friendly and savings too

Between 2013 and 2015, Kumari and her family have harvested humanure four times – a total of 10 quintals – as well as 72 gallons of urine. “Earlier the sugarcane crop used to be yellowish in colour and wasn’t very strong,” she said. “But, after using humanure and urine, it is both tall and strong.”

For the last two years, her family has stopped buying chemical fertilisers and are saving Rs 10,000-Rs 12,000 per annum. On 17 acres of land, she organically grows wheat, paddy, corn, and sugarcane. A 2.5 acre plot is used as a kitchen garden to grow vegetables.

The entire hamlet of Poorvi Tola has benefited from the 31 Phaydemand Shauchalay, which have together generated 108 quintals of humanure and 24,900 litres of urine in two years. As against a conventional latrine that uses eight to nine litres of water per flush, Phaydemand Shauchalay requires very little wash water. Thus, Poorvi Tola is saving 2,160 litres of water every day by using these ecosan toilets.

Free pit toilets vs ecosan toilets

Early last year, Vinita started visiting Kairi village in Domath to educate the villagers about ecological sanitation. Kairi is a Tharu tribe village of 138 families, and till last year, it did not have even a single toilet.

After holding meetings with the villagers, four Tharu families decided to end open defecation and construct Phaydemand Shauchalay. By April 2015, four ecosan toilets were ready. “Earlier women and young girls in my family used to walk long distances to defecate every morning,” said Yogendra Nath, smiling. “Now they use Phaydemand Shauchalay at home. I am very happy.”

Five-year-old Sunil happily poses in front of the Phaydemand Shauchalay at his house in Kairi village in Bihar. (Photo credit: Nidhi Jamwal).

Nath’s Phaydemand Shauchalay cost a total of Rs 18,015 of which Rs 12,000 was sourced from government funds and the balance was paid by Nath himself.

However, Kumari is now finding it very difficult to convince other families in Kairi to adopt these ecosan toilets as the Government of India is providing a subsidy of Rs 12,000 per individual household latrine under the Swachh Bharat Mission.

“The village panchayats are hiring contractors and getting conventional pit latrines constructed to make a killing out of the central subsidy,” said Kumari. “Since more toilets mean more subsidy, latrines are being constructed at a rapid speed with no quality control or monitoring.”

Till April last year, there wasn’t even a single toilet in Kairi village. But, within nine months, more than 16 pit toilets were constructed under the Swachh Bharat Mission, which was launched in October 2014 to end open defecation across India by 2019. Predictably, a free toilet sells faster than one where a user family has to contribute to the cost of construction.

Another issue is that the Baseline Survey data of 2013 collected by the states, as per which free toilets are being constructed in rural households, is flawed.

“We are aware of the wrong entries in the survey,” said Bhogendra Mishra, executive engineer, Public Health Engineering Department (Bettiah), Pashchim Champaran. “Several families without a toilet have been marked as already having a toilet. But, since the data has already been forwarded to the Central government, we cannot do anything about it.”

Clearly, the Swachh Bharat Mission will fail to meet its goal of an India free of open defecation unless it promotes innovative technology built around the principles of ecological sanitation. The errors in the Baseline Survey, too, need to be addressed.

After more than a century, golf is finally returning to the Olympic Games. Here’s what to watch for in the first two rounds.

After a wait of 112 years, men’s tournament golf is finally set to take the stage as an Olympic sport once again. The tee times and group pairings for the first two rounds were released on Monday. Everything is in place for a great four rounds of golf on the Gil Hanse-designed Olympic Golf Course near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

One early highlight to look forward to on Thursday morning is Brazil’s own Adilson da Silva hitting the opening tee shot of the Olympic tournament.

“The first guy in 112 years – or whatever it is – to open the Olympics,” da Silva said. “… It was a big surprise. I was thrilled. It’s amazing.”

Da Silva tees off at 6:30 a.m. (ET) with Canadian Graham DeLaet, whose country won the last Olympic golf event in 1904, and Korean Byeong Hun An.

Another notable group for the 72-hole stroke play competition includes Bubba Watson (USA), Martin Kaymer (Germany) and Anirban Lahiri (India).

As a two-time major winner and three-time member of the US Ryder Cup team, Watson is arguably the top golfer at these Olympic Games. However, his recent underwhelming performances (T-39 at The Open and T-60 at the PGA) may be cause for concern.

Kaymer, the 2014 PLAYERS and U.S. Open champion, is starting to heat up at just the right time, notching a strong T-7 at the PGA Championship two weeks ago. Throw in Lahiri’s T-6 at Colonial back in May, and this 8:14 a.m. group appears to have some real potential.

The only group to feature three golfers inside the top 40 of the Official World Golf Ranking tees off at 9:25 a.m. It includes Sergio Garcia (Spain), Patrick Reed (USA) and Emiliano Grillo (Argentina).

Prior to missing the cut at Baltusrol, Garcia was on a nice run of top 10 finishes that included good performances at The Open Championship and the U.S. Open. His biggest competition in the group is likely to be Reed, who enters the week with his own hot streak of four straight top 15s. Lurking in the background will be Grillo, who found the top 15 at both The Open Championship and the PGA Championship this summer.

As for the other two Americans vying for Olympic gold, Ryder Cup hopeful Rickie Fowler will tee off at 9:58 a.m. with Great Britain’s Justin Rose and Venezuela’s Jhonattan Vegas. Matt Kuchar, who until last week was under the impression that the Olympic event would feature a team format rather than individual stroke play, will begin his round at 8:03 a.m. alongside Great Britain’s Danny Willett and China’s Li Haotong.

With only 60 competitors in the field, there will be no cut this week. Expect there to be added pressure on these Olympic golfers to put themselves in position for a successful weekend. Below is a complete list of the pairings and tee times for the first and second rounds of the men’s Olympic competition.

What does it say when the death of rhinos in Assam’s floods makes it to national news, but not the plight of lakhs of Assamese people? The media seems to be a willing partner in perpetrating the idea that the people of the Northeast are not important. Keeping people from the Northeast invisible, whether it’s in the news or mass media, is probably why the rest of India thinks they are either Chinese or Korean or Japanese. Anything but Indian.

Go back to China, a cab driver told me in a rage in his broken English after I had a tiff with him for refusing to drop me at the doorstep. I came to this city to pursue my passion for journalism from my hometown Darjeeling, a small town cradled in the foothills of Himalayas, bordering Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh.

And it’s not just this driver in Chennai. It started in my school days, when I was too tender to understand the racial differences. I used to wonder why people in other cities I visited during my vacations called me “Chinese”. I sang the Jana-gana-mana in my school every day and pledged that all Indian are my brothers and sisters too. One of my friends from Manipur who studied in a top fashion institute in Chennai was asked if he eats dog meat.

“Are you from China?” asked a colleague recently. When I gently replied that I was an Indian, I got a wide-eyed stare with raised eyebrows and a smirk that gestured “are you sure?”

Though this was not an uncommon experience and I’ve been facing this every time I venture to a new city, this did not feel right. I could not ignore their ignorance anymore.

Besides China, I am identified with Korea, Nepal and Japan.

Coming to the new city I was nervous if I would be accepted by people socially and culturally. I am not an idli-dosa person, but more of a rice and noodle kind. I knew I would have to compromise on food and that language would be a herculean barrier.

“People in Chennai will only speak Tamil even if they know English, they abhor Hindi,” I was warned by my cousins who had lived here for a while.

That made me anxious, especially because I am in the field of journalism and interacting with people is my part of day-to-day duty.

But within a month’s time I had developed great fondness for pongal and dosa. I even started enjoying the Tamil language and music though I am still not able to string together a sentence properly. I was relieved to find restaurants that served food from my hometown like momo, thukpa and shyapta.

“Chennai is better than what you told me” I told my cousin over the phone. “Well but aren’t they racist?” she counteracted.

To be honest, I have made a few friends in the city. I don’t necessarily blame them for introducing me to their friends as Korean or Chinese. I even saw a text message on my friend’s phone that read, “Bring your Chinese friend along.”

I have small eyes that droop at the edges, my nose is tiny and I am told that I am “marble white”. I guess I can’t blame them for thinking I am Chinese or Korean. One of my Malayali friends in college, who had mistaken me for Japanese on the first day, told me how it annoys her when people think she is Tamilian. When I made friends with Tamilians, they told me how it annoys them to be identified as Malayalis.

To be honest, I clearly cannot distinguish between Tamilian or Malayali because the two states share so much in common and these two states belong to the same country. At the end of the day, you are identified as an Indian.

I am not pointing this out to share the likeness, but rather a difference. The eight Northeastern states are completely ignored as a part of India and Northeasterners are addressed as Chinese, Japanese, Nepalese or Korean, and are not confused between the people of the states Assamese, Arunachali or Sikkimese.

I wonder how the textbook that displays India’s map is perceived by young children who theoretically learn that India is a diverse country but have no idea how Indians of the Northeast look. Maybe that could be the reason why after almost 69 years of Indian Independence, people still fail to recognise us as Indians.

Another curious question I often encounter is about what language I speak at home? I reply that I speak Nepali. “Oh! So you are from Nepal?” Nepal is one of the 150 major languages of India, and the Nepali I speak is slightly different from that spoken in Nepal — much like the difference between American and British English.

As much as I enjoy going places and meeting people, I do not like to battle my identity on a daily basis. Sometimes I think hard about why there Northeasterner have to face an identity crises en masse. India boasts that of its unity in diversity but the under-representation of over 40 million Indians of the Northeast exposes the authenticity of the claim.

As a journalist, I feel even the media must share the blame. Though I felt the floods in Assam on July 29 that killed 26 and affected over 18 lakh people got a fair share of coverage, I find my Northeast Facebook friends protesting that the media ignored many aspects of the flood and simply reported the death tolls of people and rhinos. A popular meme circulating on social media says a traffic jam in Gurgaon makes it to national news while floods in Assam that displaced over 20 lakh people doesn’t even register as a blip.

The kind of racism I face on a daily basis is based more than on just how I look. Little kids used the word “chinky” and “ching-chang” to address me when I was at a book fair on Island Grounds in the city two months ago. One was about 12 and the other two appeared younger. Their usage of racist slurs makes me believe there is a flaw in the system, as racism seems to be preached from one generation to another.","Tue, 02 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2016/8/2/22/w600X390/regina-gurung.png,"['indian', 'northeast', 'chinky', 'called', 'told', 'im', 'chennai', 'friends', 'media', 'states', 'sikkimese', 'speak', 'nepal', 'city', 'arunachali', 'chinese', 'india']",

A councillor who built luxury seaside homes on Blyth seafront has backed down in a row over flood defences after being threatened with eviction.

UKIP councillor Barry Elliott, who serves on Blyth Town Council, was given consent to build the Wayside Beachway development - providing a sea wall was built prior to the first person moving in.

The caveat was to ensure the three detached properties would be protected from flooding for at least 100 years.

It was enforced by Northumberland County Council after concerns were raised that the existing sea wall on the beach was in danger of collapsing.

However, Coun Elliott did not build the new wall and families still moved into the properties - which cost around £450,000 according to Rightmove.

In June, the council served Coun Elliott and the homeowners with an enforcement notice to vacate the properties - and said they could be demolished.

But Coun Elliott has now agreed to submit an application to build a new sea wall, despite claiming the existing defence would protect the properties.

The new sea defence would be built across a path leading down to the beach.

Coun Elliott said: “I have stated all along that this was a malicious attempt by the council to discredit me using false information.

“Despite repeatedly asking the council to provide just one shred of credible evidence to justify their reason for issuing the planning enforcement notice, they cannot answer me.

“The existing coastal defence wall has been examined by a coastal erosion engineer and it was deemed to be in a very good condition and will not be affected by any coastal erosion issues.”

The council said the planning application to resolve the issue is now being considered by its officers.

A spokesman for the authority said: “We have not withdrawn the enforcement notice.

“However, we would not pursue enforcement action until the application is determined.

“The outcome of the application would mean that it is either approved and will resolve the matter or it is refused and we would then continue with enforcement action.”","Wed, 10 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article10935250.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/JS81451338.jpg,"['wall', 'elliott', 'row', 'application', 'defence', 'evicted', 'existing', 'seafront', 'blyth', 'homes', 'wont', 'enforcement', 'council', 'sea', 'flood', 'families', 'properties', 'coun', 'councillor']",

They also vowed to continue agitation if their demands are not fulfilled. They also demanded naming of halls after Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and four national leaders – Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmed, M Mansur Ali and AHM Qamaruzzaman. The agitators said they were facing many problems, including accommodation and transport. “We are not enjoying dormitory facilities although 11 years have passed since a college has turned into a university,” said a protestor. They added this was only public university, which was transformed into Jagannath University in 2005 by passing a bill named Jagannath University Act-2005 in the national parliament, where thousands of students cannot reside in dormitory. Apart from this, the campus area is also very small. Currently, students are facing various problems in staying at rented houses over the ongoing issue of terrorism and militancy, said the students. An agitator said: “People do not want to rent their houses to us, as we are bachelors, fearing militancy.” Md Ohiduzzaman, registrar of the university, said the authorities had sent a letter to the Home Ministry over permanent ownership of the former Dhaka central jail’s land on March 23, 2014. In the letter, JnU authorities mentioned that the land of the central jail, after shifting the prisoners, could be used for building residential halls to solve the housing crisis of the students. Over 6,000 prisoners of Dhaka Central Jail were shifted to the newly constructed jail in Keraniganj on July 29, 2016. Nur Mohammad, proctor of the university, said: “We are talking to the students to solve the issue peacefully. We have urged them to be calm, as August is the month of mourning.” “August 7, 2016, we had contacted with registrar department over the land but they did not say anything yet,” he added. Addition police have been deployed in and around of the campus to avoid any unpleasant incident over the issue, said Officer-in-Charge of Kotwali police station Abu Bakr Siddique. In 2014, students of the university staged demonstration on the campus for several days, demanding measures to recover dormitories of the university grabbed by influential quarters.","Mon, 08 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2016/08/tm-news.jpg,"['land', 'old', 'registrar', 'university', 'dhaka', 'central', 'jnu', 'demand', 'solve', 'jail', 'issue', 'campus', 'problems', 'construction', 'halls', 'site', 'students']",

Typhoon Nida was predicted to affect nearly all communities in the Hong Kong - Guangzhou - Macau megapolis area, as it made landfall on August 2.

People living in the storm's path had been told to prepare three days' worth of food and other essentials, China's government-owned Xinhua news agency reported.

Members of the public in Guangzhou have been advised to stay indoors, and all work as well as mass transport has reportedly been cancelled due to Typhoon Nida, Xinhua reported.

Air traffic suspended

More than 220 flights out of Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai airports were cancelled, according to the Sohu news portal.

Gale-force winds also disrupted hundreds of flights out of Hong Kong, while low-lying areas were put on flood alert. Hong Kong's first major typhoon this year brought gusts of more than 100 km per hour (62 miles per hour). More than 150 flights were cancelled, the Airport Authority said, with Cathay Pacific and Dragonair warning none of their flights would be operating until 2 pm local time (0600 UTC).

Nearly 2,000 workers working on the construction of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge were evacuated earlier, and more than 2,000 others working on an offshore oil platform were relocated on the weekend. Ferries between Hong Kong and Macau were also suspended.

Nida had brought strong winds and torrential rains to the Philippines on the weekend, while southern China has already been hit by storms this year. Last month, Typhoon Nepartak drove at least 420,000 Chinese from their homes, left at least 69 dead and caused more than 7.1 billion yuan (980 million euros/$1.1 billion) in losses in Fujian province alone.

Cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes - the power of devastation Social distancing impossible during Cyclone Amphan Residents along Bangladesh's coast are being moved to safety as one of the strongest cyclones in years strikes the region. Millions of people had to be evacuated from low-lying regions along the Bay of Bengal on May 19. But plans are complicated by the coronavirus precautions. Maintaining social distancing is nearly impossible.

Cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes - the power of devastation Typhoon season amid the COVID-19 pandemic On May 14, Typhoon Vongfong slammed the Philippines with strong winds and heavy rains, destroying the city of San Policarpo in the eastern province of Samar. At least five people died and more than 91,000 people were forced to leave their homes. Typhoons are not unusual in the Philippines at this time of year. But the COVID-19 outbreak lockdown measures are exacerbating the situation.

Cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes - the power of devastation Three names - one phenomenon Hurricane, typhoon, and cyclone are actually three names for the same phenomenon. Along the North American coast they are called hurricanes, in East and Southeast Asia they are called typhoons, and near India and Australia they are called cyclones. But despite the different names, they develop in the same way.

Cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes - the power of devastation A cyclone is created Tropical storms develop over oceans when the water temperature is at least 26 degrees Celsius (79 degrees Fahrenheit). As the warm water evaporates and condenses, the air around it heats up and drags cooler air upwards, creating powerful winds.

Cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes - the power of devastation The eye of the storm The Earth's rotation causes the air stream to move around the eye of the storm, which can be up to 50 kilometers wide. This area is nearly completely free of clouds and wind.

Cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes - the power of devastation A storm hits land When a tropical storm hits a coastline, it becomes weaker due to the lack of warm water. In Australia, ""Marcia"" was soon downgraded to a category one storm, while ""Lam"" weakened after striking near Brisbane. Masses of water from the sea often cause the worst damage - as seen here in China after Typhoon Nanmadol in August 2011.

Cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes - the power of devastation Chaos ensues Hurricane Sandy was one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded over the Atlantic Ocean. It caused waves of up to 4 meters high, fires, power outages and broken dykes. Sandy arrived with winds at speeds of more than 145 kilometers per hour. Cuba, New York and New Jersey were particularly affected.

Cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes - the power of devastation Destructive vortex Tornadoes however, are non-tropical whirlwinds that can occur anywhere a storm is brewing. Local temperature differences force warm air upwards and cold air down, and a column of warm air rotates upwards at an increasing velocity. Tornadoes are usually only a maximum of 1 kilometer in diameter.

Cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes - the power of devastation Fastest storms As the warm air rises, it forms a funnel, the main characteristic of a tornado. Inside the funnel, the speed of the air can be tremendous - up to 500 kilometers per hour. Tornadoes are the fastest whirlwind type of weather phenomenon.

Cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes - the power of devastation Trail of destruction A tornado can leave a trail of destruction several kilometers long. In the US Midwest, tornadoes occur several hundred times a year, as dry, cold air from the north hits damp, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico. It's different in other countries - in Germany, for example, tornadoes occasionally occur along the coast. Author: Brigitte Osterath / ew

53,53,FL-2016-000075-BGD,"Of spices, for spices - The Daily Star",https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/spices-spices-1261918,"Imagine “Chingri Dopeyaja” (shrimp fry with onion) without onion or beef curry without ginger paste or cumin.

Food without spices would be like life without colours to the Bangalee taste bud. However, these spices do not come free.

Every year, the government spends over Tk 1,500 crore to import spices to meet the country's demand for these culinary ingredients.

According to Kalim Uddin, chief scientific officer (CSO) of the Spices Research Centre, Bogra, which conducts research on 35 out of 109 spices used worldwide, Bangladeshis use 27 different spices in their cooking and only 17 of these spices grow in the country. The rest are imported.

Considering the money spent on spice import and exploring opportunities for export, the Spices Research Centre was established in the mid 1990s and it started its research activities in 1998.

The centre works under Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) of Gazipur and it supervises three regional spices research centres in Magura, Comilla and Gazipur's Joydebpur and four sub-regional centres in Lalmonirhat, Faridpur, Khagrachhari and Jaintapur of Sylhet.

Kalim Uddin serves as the in-charge of the centre leading 14 expert scientists, nine scientific assistant and around 30 staff.

Another 80 regular and 70 irregular field labourers work daily on the 70 acres of land of the research centre located beside Bogra-Shibganj road under Shibganj upazila in Bogra.

Scientists at the centre said that so far 31 high-yielding varieties of 14 crop spices were invented along with 84 production technologies, which detailed how the high-yielding varieties should be planted and grown to ensure high standard.

During harvesting time, the centre provides training on the use of fertiliser, pesticide, and harvesting process to the root-level farmers, staff of Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) and agri-related officials and employees of different NGOs.

In fiscal 2014-15, trainings were provided to 1,830 farmers, 320 officers of DAE, BADC and NGOs, said Kalim Uddin.

The centre has also preserved 257 varieties of Germplasm -- seed or plant tissue -- for research to improve standard of the spices' varieties.

So far success has been achieved in the research of a number of spices, including garlic, onion, cumin, cardamom, clove, scented grass (Vaduri Pata), lemon grass and curry leaf.

Kalim Uddin said the centre's innovation in Vaduri Pata can produce the scent of Pulao in normal cooked rice, when the crushed leaf is sprinkled over the rice.

The success in onion research has been notable as the centre invented three summer varieties which can meet the demand for onions during off season.

The CSO said each year 13.5 lakh metric tonnes of onions are produced but the country's demand is 22 lakh metric tonnes, met partially through imports from India, Myanmar and some other neighbouring countries.

“Summer-seasonal, high yielding onions -- BARI Onion-2, 3, 5, which can be produced during the Bangla month of Ashwin-Kartik, can be a boon for the economy of the country,” said Kalim Uddin.

“The prices of onion would also go down and become more affordable for people once the high-yielding varieties are cultivated,” he said, adding that they had not yet released the seeds of these varieties to farmers.

These hybrid varieties have almost three times more production capability than local varieties, Kalim Uddin said.

Similar to the high-yielding onions, the research centre came up with BARI Garlic 3 and 4, which is expected to meet the demand of garlic of the country and reduce import expenditure.

“The research centre has been prioritising research in introducing climate changed-based salty and tolerant varieties of spices,” said the CSO.

The centre is also trying to come up with innovation wherein two or more spice crops can be grown alongside simultaneously, he added.

Regarding spice export, sources in the centre said some companies like Pran, BD Foods and Hortex Foundation have recently been exporting different spices, including fresh green chilli and green chilli powder to Asian countries where the demands are high.

The centre has its limitations too which include scarcity of land, lack of quality seeds and disease-free plants, lack of opportunity to collect Germplasm from exotic sources and link with the international spices research organisations and lack of storage facilities at root level.

The CSO also noted the decreasing interest among farmers in cultivating spices instead of vegetables and cereal crops and the impact on spice cultivation due to climate change and humidity increase have posed additional challenge to the research centre.

Kalim Uddin urged that the media and organisations, including DAE and BADC, should encourage farmers to cultivate spices, which in turn would inspire the centre in their research activities.","Sun, 31 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/green_chillies.jpg?itok=R3NIZoLn,"['kalim', 'uddin', 'centre', 'varieties', 'research', 'onions', 'onion', 'spices', 'spice', 'highyielding']",

Dev started his speech in Bengali, only to be interrupted by speaker Sumitra Mahajan, who asked him whether he had given a notice earlier that he would be speaking in his mother tongue – Bengali.

To which, Dev replied, “Yes ma’am, I have given the notice to the house.” The speaker told Dev, that she would come back to him in a few minutes. Later, when Dev got his turn to speak in the house, he demanded immediate implementation of the ‘Ghatal Master Plan’. “I have grown up hearing about the Ghatal Master Plan. But, it is far from being implemented. Hence, I demand immediate implementation of the ‘Ghatal Master Plan’,” said Dev.

‘Ghatal Master Plan’ is project designed for better drainage facilities and flood control two districts of West Bengal - East and West Midnapore. During monsoons, these two districts are badly affected by the floods, as a result of which, lakhs of people are displaced from their homes. The ‘Ghatal Master Plan’ was announced in the year 2009 for the construction of embankments and improvement of the drainage system in the area.

The West Bengal Cabinet on Tuesday decided to rename the state as ‘Bangla’ or ‘Bongo’ in Bengali and ‘Bengal’ in English. The news was confirmed by Trinamool Congress leader and state Education Minister Partha Chatterjee, who said a special Assembly session will be convened on August 26 to discuss the name change. ‘The Cabinet has taken a very important decision. We had suggested a change in name of the state. For the sake of the people, culture and tradition, we have decided to change the name in Bengali as ‘Bangla’ or ‘Bongo’. We will put forward the suggestion in the Legislative Assembly. The state’s name in English would be ‘Bengal’. We will discuss this issue in the Assembly on August 26,’ State Education Minister Partha Chatterjee said.

The ruling party in the state had decided to rename West Bengal to ‘Paschim Banga’ in 2011 to raise the state’s position alphabetically. Besides the TMC, the opposition parties led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had also supported the move then.

(Sydney) – About 1,200 men, women, and children who sought refuge in Australia and were forcibly transferred to the remote Pacific island nation of Nauru suffer severe abuse, inhumane treatment, and neglect, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said today. The Australian government’s failure to address serious abuses appears to be a deliberate policy to deter further asylum seekers from arriving in the country by boat.



Refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru, most of whom have been held there for three years, routinely face neglect by health workers and other service providers who have been hired by the Australian government, as well as frequent unpunished assaults by local Nauruans. They endure unnecessary delays and at times denial of medical care, even for life-threatening conditions. Many have dire mental health problems and suffer overwhelming despair – self-harm and suicide attempts are frequent. All face prolonged uncertainty about their future.

Few other countries go to such lengths to deliberately inflict suffering on people seeking safety and freedom. Anna Neistat Senior director for research at Amnesty International



“Australia’s policy of exiling asylum seekers who arrive by boat is cruel in the extreme,” said Anna Neistat, senior director for research at Amnesty International, who conducted the investigation on the island for the organization. “Few other countries go to such lengths to deliberately inflict suffering on people seeking safety and freedom.”



Australian authorities are well aware of the abuses on Nauru. The Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), a Senate Select Committee, and a government-appointed independent expert have each highlighted many of these practices, and called on the government to change them. The Australian government’s persistent failure to address abuses committed under its authority on Nauru strongly suggests that they are adopted or condoned as a matter of policy.



By forcibly transferring refugees and people seeking asylum to Nauru, detaining them for prolonged periods in inhuman conditions, denying them appropriate medical care, and in other ways structuring its operations so that many experience a serious degradation of their mental health, the Australian government has violated the rights to be free from torture and other ill-treatment, and from arbitrary detention, as well as other fundamental protections, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said.

Driving adult and even child refugees to the breaking point with sustained abuse appears to be one of Australia’s aims on Nauru. Michael Bochenek Senior counsel on children’s rights



“Australia’s atrocious treatment of the refugees on Nauru over the past three years has taken an enormous toll on their well-being,” said Michael Bochenek, senior counsel on children’s rights at Human Rights Watch who conducted the investigation on the island for the organization. “Driving adult and even child refugees to the breaking point with sustained abuse appears to be one of Australia’s aims on Nauru.”



Australia and Nauru impose strict secrecy on the processing of asylum seekers on Nauru and refuse most requests to visit from journalists or researchers. Nevertheless, an Amnesty International researcher and a Human Rights Watch researcher were able to enter Nauru legally and remain for a total of 12 days in July 2016. They were not asked about their organizational affiliations when they completed entry formalities. They interviewed 84 refugees and asylum seekers from Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Bangladesh, Kuwait, and Afghanistan, including stateless Kurds who had been living in Iran or Iraq. Twenty-nine were women. Five were girls, and four were boys. The researchers also interviewed several service providers, who agreed to share information despite risking prosecution for providing information.



Nauru, a tiny, impoverished island of 21 square kilometers, or eight square miles, is smaller than Melbourne’s airport. The population is 10,000. The island’s interior, devastated by 40 years of phosphate mining, is mostly uninhabitable and uncultivable. Employment opportunities are scarce, and basic services, such as health and education, are largely inadequate.



Australia has been forcibly transferring families with children, unaccompanied children, and single men and women to Nauru since September 2012, under Memorandums of Understanding between the two countries. Australia agreed to cover all costs associated with the offshore detention and processing of the asylum seekers and refugees. The Australian government spent 415 million Australian dollars (US$314 million) on its Nauru operations in the fiscal year ending on April 30, 2015, nearly $350,000 for each person held on the island in that year alone.



Those transferred to Nauru initially spent a year or more housed in cramped vinyl tents in a detention facility called the “Regional Processing Centre” (RPC), with temperatures indoors regularly reaching 45 to 50 degrees Celsius (113 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit), and torrential rains and flooding.



Refugees and asylum seekers described conditions in these detention camps as “prison-like,” with regular searches of their tents by the guards, confiscation of “prohibited” items – including food and sewing needles – two-minute showers, and filthy toilets.



The RPC is run by a private company hired by the Australian government, which has effective control of the facility and is responsible for ensuring the health and welfare of the asylum seekers detained there. Australia shares responsibility with Nauru for human rights violations committed against the refugees and asylum seekers.



Those the Australian and Nauru governments recognize as refugees are generally provided accommodation in open camps or other housing throughout the island. Families are generally assigned prefabricated units or converted containers, and single men are placed in rooms with space only for a bed and a small shelf. About one-third of the 1,200 refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru remain in the tents, people interviewed said.



Since October 2015, Nauru has allowed asylum seekers greater freedom of movement around the island, a step widely interpreted as a response to litigation in Australia challenging the lawfulness of asylum seekers’ detention. But those who remain in the tents may not bring smartphones into the center, are monitored by guards, and face other restrictions on their liberty.



Prolonged detention in appalling conditions exacerbated the trauma many had suffered from persecution in their home countries and the abuses and other hazards they faced on their journeys to Australia, as the Australian Human Rights Commission and UNHCR, among others, have found.



Refugees and asylum seekers interviewed said they have developed severe anxiety, inability to sleep, mood swings, prolonged depression, and short-term memory loss on the island. Children have begun to wet their beds, suffered from nightmares, and engaged in disruptive and other troubling behavior. Adults and children spoke openly of having wanted to end their lives. However, refugees on Nauru do not receive adequate support or mental health treatment.



The standard of medical care for refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru is also poor. Medical equipment is rudimentary, and specialist medical attention is not regularly available. Dental services are largely limited to tooth extraction.



Refugees and asylum seekers described long delays on seeing specialists for serious conditions or for being transferred to medical facilities outside Nauru for care not available there. Under new policies, those transferred to Australia for care must go without their family members in most cases, an apparent attempt to force them to return to Nauru.



When Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch put these concerns about medical care to International Health and Medical Services, the company hired by the Australian government to provide medical services on Nauru, senior staff denied that care was poor.



The physical safety of those held on Nauru is a serious concern, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said. Many asylum seekers had been beaten and robbed. Every woman interviewed said she could not go out alone. Interviewees said that local police made little or no effort to investigate attacks against them.



Children who attend local schools described frequent bullying and harassment from Nauruan students, who tell them to go back to their home countries. Many have stopped attending classes altogether.



Some refugees and asylum seekers said that the abuses they endured gave them little option but to accept or request return to countries where they face a real risk of persecution or other serious harm.



The Australian government should immediately resettle the refugees in Australia and close the Nauru offshore processing center. While refugees and asylum seekers remain on Nauru, Australia should ensure that they receive quality medical and mental health care. Nauru should allow independent human rights monitors and journalists access to the island, and Australia should do likewise for its “processing centers” for asylum seekers.

A Wall of Secrecy

The Australian government’s offshore operation on Nauru is surrounded by a wall of secrecy, with both Australia and Nauru going to great lengths to prevent the flow of information off the island. Service providers and others who work on the island face criminal charges and civil penalties under Australian law if they disclose information about conditions for asylum seekers and refugees held offshore. Nauru has banned Facebook on the island and has enacted vaguely worded laws against threats to public order that legal experts fear could be used to criminalize protests by refugees and asylum seekers.



Journalists in particular face severe restrictions on entry, with an $8,000 non-refundable visa fee and a protracted application process. Nauru has granted visas to just two media outlets since January 2014. Other requests have been rebuffed or met with no response. UN officials have been denied entry or in some cases have concluded that a visit would be impractical due to severe limitations on their access.





Attacks, Sexual Violence, and Impunity

Every refugee and asylum seeker interviewed reported intimidation, harassment, or violence directed at them or family members by Nauruans acting alone or in groups. They said the assailants cursed and spat on them, threw bottles and stones, swerved vehicles in their direction as they walked or rode on motorbikes, or broke their windows or destroyed other property.

Click to expand Image Refugees and asylum seekers are frequently attacked by local people. © 2016 Private Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International documented cases in which Nauruans, alone or in groups, assaulted and robbed refugees and asylum seekers, sometimes at knifepoint, during daylight or in the evening. In all, more than 20 of those we interviewed said they had been attacked by Nauruans.



A refugee from Bangladesh suffered serious head trauma in May 2016, when a Nauruan man threw a large rock at him, kicked the refugee off his motorbike, and beat him after he fell. A Somali woman reported that several Nauruan men attacked her husband in March, hitting him on the head with a machete. The following night, a group of Nauruans tried to break into the family’s housing. A Somali man said a Nauruan man robbed him when he attempted to hitchhike to a store.



Many others spoke of being attacked by Nauruan men, who stole their money, mobile phones, and motorbikes, as the refugees went to work or bought food. A service provider confirmed that such assaults happen “several times a week, especially over the weekend.”



As a result, refugees and asylum seekers said they were afraid to leave their accommodations, particularly at night. Women said they almost never left the camps and then only in groups, or with male companions.



Six women described sexual assault or harassment, including groping, touching, explicit threats, demands for sex, and attempted rape. One woman said that on two occasions Nauruan men tried to drive her to the jungle when she was catching a ride with them, clearly intending to rape her. She also said that at one point she got a job at a shop on the island but had to quit after the first day because other employees kept touching her.



One young woman said she married for protection after being released into the community:

After I left the camp, I felt very unsafe, I could not go out. I decided to marry a man who is 15 years older, just to have protection. If you are alone, everything is a struggle. At least he could go shopping or accompany me. Now he is in the hospital, and I have to rely on my case manager if I need to go out of the house.

Another woman said:

We are always scared, all the time. I am always checking the door to see if it is locked. We can’t go out alone. A lot of times, some Nauruans get drunk and come near the entrance by the road and shout at us.

Refugees and asylum seekers said that Nauruan police disregard their complaints and sometimes discourage them from filing reports. Police have dismissed some complaints as “made for media exposure only,” a news report said. Several refugees provided Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International with copies of reports they filed with local police following the attacks, saying that police had done nothing to investigate or apprehend the attackers, even if the victims were able to identify them. Service providers, who said they often have to accompany refugees to file police reports, confirmed these statements.



Nauru’s former chief justice, Geoffrey Eames, QC, testified before an Australian Senate Select Committee in July 2015, that “there is a serious question about [police] independence and about their willingness to investigate allegations against Nauruans who are charged with assaults of non-Nauruans.” (Eames, an Australian national, was forced out of office after Nauruan authorities revoked his visa in January 2014.)



Medical Care

International Health and Medical Services (IHMS), a company hired by the Australian government, is the main health service provider for refugees and asylum seekers. Some of its staff have publicly condemned the appalling treatment of refugees on Nauru, raising concerns about the company’s operations there. Specialized medical equipment and staff are not available on Nauru; Nauruans who require more than basic medical care are sent to Australia or Fiji. Refugees and asylum seekers reported that the hospital lacks even basic supplies, such as bandages or sterile gloves.

Some of those interviewed said that they had developed serious medical problems in Nauru and that they had received virtually no specialized medical attention. They had heart and kidney diseases; diabetes accompanied by weight loss and rapidly deteriorating eyesight; and back problems leading to reduced mobility, among other conditions. When Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch raised these concerns with senior IHMS staff in Australia, they “strongly refuted” allegations of poor quality medical care.



Parents were particularly critical of services available to women during pregnancy and childbirth and said that newborns suffered from persistent infections and other medical conditions.



An asylum seeker described conditions while his wife was in labor:

I saw my wife lying under the bed. The bed didn’t have a mattress…. I saw the nurse, an Australian nurse, playing on her tablet. My wife was crying. I said, “Please do something for my wife. This is like a jail, not a delivery room.” The bathroom didn’t have tissue or handwashing liquid. I went out to buy handwashing liquid and rolls of tissue.

Because they cannot leave the island without authorization, they are completely dependent on the Australian authorities and service providers to arrange for them to be transferred to medical facilities outside Nauru. Interviewees described long delays while suffering with serious conditions, without any information, before eventually being transferred to hospitals in Papua New Guinea or Australia for tests or surgery.



One father said:

My son has kidney problems. We have been visiting IHMS for two years now, and they keep promising he would see a regular doctor, but it hasn’t happened. They just take tests, but do not prescribe any treatment. My daughter has been having such problems with her eyesight that she cannot see the blackboard in school and has to ask her classmates for help – but there is no way to get glasses, or even get her eyesight properly tested here.

A young man with diabetes said that after he lost 27 kilograms (60 pounds), he went to the IHMS manager. The manager told him that such weight loss is “normal” and that he only would be “moderately worried” if the weight loss continued. The family recorded the conversation on a mobile phone and provided a copy to researchers.



A young woman who had been forced to undergo genital mutilation in her home country said that as a result, she was experiencing severe pain and was not able to have sexual intercourse. She has received no treatment for her condition in her time on Nauru. She said:

For five months, they just kept referring me to a mental health specialist. I had no idea what was wrong with me, and just kept blaming myself for everything. I’ve been able to see a gynecologist a few times since, but there is nothing they can do here for my condition, and for a year and [a] half now they keep telling me that I need to be transferred for treatment, but so far it has not happened.

Refugees and asylum seekers reported multiple situations in which they tried calling an ambulance when their friends or family members needed urgent help, but the hospital refused to send one. A service provider confirmed these accounts:

When people call [an] ambulance, or even when we call, they sometimes come, and sometimes not, sometimes in 20 minutes and sometimes in three hours. But we are also not allowed to call ambulances for our clients, or transport them to the hospital in our vehicles – because it is considered “advocacy,” and we are supposed to help our clients be “independent.” We often have people discharged while they are still sick, sometimes half-conscious; once a patient still had needles in the hands. We are not allowed to ask the hospital why they are being discharged, or what medication they’ve been prescribed, or for their medical records.

Even getting a pair of glasses can be an ordeal; one woman reported that she waited nine months for her prescription to be filled from Australia.



Denial of Access to Medical Records

At least five refugees and asylum seekers reported that their personal requests for their medical records have been denied or have yielded partial records – lacking information on surgery they had undergone, for example. In some instances, they received pages that were blank except for their name and age and the doctor’s initials.



In several of the cases Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International reviewed, doctors made written requests in medical reports for overseas treatment for refugees and asylum seekers because the hospital lacked the necessary expertise or equipment. Those referred for overseas treatment may wait for months before they are transferred.



Medical Transfers to Australia, Papua New Guinea

Medical transfers are frequently carried out with little notice, often separating family members. In one case, a man was told that his wife would need prolonged specialized treatment for her mental health condition, which they asked him to authorize without giving him any information about when she would be transferred:

The next thing I heard was, “Oh, we sent your wife to Australia on an emergency flight.” That was the next day. My son took it very bad. He was in shock. He wasn’t able to say goodbye to his mother. [On arrival in Australia] my wife woke up, and she didn’t have any information; she didn’t even know she was in Australia....

I am really worried about my son. For the last 40 days, he hasn’t left his room. He had a special relationship with his mother. Now he doesn’t talk. He’s very angry, and he doesn’t talk. I can’t control his behavior. Everything has changed about him.

His 13-year-old son was having nightmares, had begun wetting his bed, and was hostile to and refused to interact with anybody other than his father, the man said.



Returns to Nauru following medical care in Australia are even more abrupt, and are sometimes carried out in a deeply humiliating and traumatizing way. A man who had been in Brisbane with his wife while she gave birth said:

They handcuffed my wife and me and said we had to go back to Nauru. My wife wasn’t ready. She wasn’t dressed. She was sleeping. It was not good. Why did they need to do it like this? If we have to go back to Nauru, that’s not a big deal. Why early in the morning, and with handcuffs? They took us from the room at 7 a.m. and took the baby from us. We didn’t see the baby until after 7 p.m.

In another case, a woman said:

I was sound asleep, and the door was locked. Suddenly there was an officer in front of my face, with a camera. He said, “Wake up!” I couldn’t move. I didn’t know where I was. There was an officer on each side of me holding my arms, and more officers behind me. My legs were shaking. My heart was pounding. I lost my footing, but they dragged me into a room. They didn’t even allow me to put on my glasses. They didn’t care about what the doctor had to say. They put me on the airplane. I’m still scared. When I try to sleep, I’m still remembering this.

Some said they were brought back to Nauru even though doctors had advised immigration authorities that they should not travel in their condition.



Others described having serious chronic conditions requiring transfers for treatment, which has sometimes been cut short by their forcible return to Nauru. In one such case, a young woman who developed lumps in her breasts, throat, and uterus, and was also diagnosed with ulcers, said that she was sent for treatment first to Australia and later to Papua New Guinea:

When I was in Australia, my doctor told immigration that I needed surgery for my breasts, but they still sent me back. My problems deteriorated, and a year later they sent me to Papua New Guinea for endoscopy and colonoscopy, but then returned me again. They gave me some pills, but they are not working, and I am in constant pain and cannot eat anything.

In another case, a man who suffered a heart attack after a year on the island was eventually sent to Australia, where he stayed for four months:

When they came to take me back to Nauru, IHMS people were there, and I tried to plead with them and the security, but they just took me and my family. I was scared, because the doctors found a blood clot in my heart, and clogged arteries, and said it was very dangerous. When I arrived, an IHMS doctor saw my file and said, “I cannot be responsible for you, they should not have sent you back.” I had another heart attack since, and the doctors keep saying that they cannot do anything here, that I need professional treatment and a proper hospital.

When Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch asked IHMS if they had any medical concerns about the timing and manner of transfers, senior medical staff replied that the organizations would have to ask the Australian Department of Immigration about this issue.



Beginning in February 2016, Australian immigration authorities have insisted on medical transfers to Papua New Guinea rather than Australia, service providers said. In cases in which the transfer to Australia is still deemed necessary, Australian immigration officials usually authorize transfer of the patient alone. Service providers said that this new practice was introduced after lawyers in Australia were successful in preventing the returns of some of the refugees to Nauru following medical treatment. “Now that their families remain on the island, they have no choice but to return,” one said.



Mental Health

Refugees and asylum seekers suffering psychological trauma and severe mental health conditions do not receive adequate support or treatment. Only two types of mental health services are available. International Health and Medical Services (IHMS), the private contractor hired by the Australian government which is the main health service provider for refugees and asylum seekers, appears to make heavy use of strong sedative and anti-psychotic medication – for children as well as adults – to address mental health issues. Refugees and asylum seekers said that these medications have severe side effects but provide little relief. IHMS senior staff in Australia “strongly refuted” allegations of poor quality care, including the charge that prescriptions were inappropriate, when Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch spoke with them in advance of publication.



Another agency, Offshore Service for Survivors of Torture and Trauma (OSSTT), officially deals only with previous trauma.



Families can wait for months to have their children seen by a visiting specialist.



Nearly all interviewees reported mental health issues of some kind – high levels of anxiety, trouble sleeping, mood swings, and feelings of listlessness and despondency were most commonly mentioned – that they said began when they were transferred to Nauru. In many cases, the consequences appeared to be severe; they repeatedly self-harmed, cutting their hands or banging their heads against the wall, did not speak to anybody for months, did not recognize their relatives, and stayed in bed for weeks, refusing to go outside or take showers. One woman told researchers that during her time on Nauru she had begun to wash her hands compulsively, hundreds of times a day.



Family members said that children also began to wet their beds, suffer nightmares, act out, and in some instances had stopped interacting with or even speaking to people outside of their immediate families.



Even so, refugees and asylum seekers sometimes received diagnoses that were not reached on the basis of full psychiatric evaluations and did not appear to take into account their experiences of trauma in their home countries, their prolonged detention on Nauru, and their uncertainty about their future.



Many of the interviewees said that when they reported their own or their relatives’ mental problems to the IHMS, the complaints were often dismissed, and in some cases they were accused of acting and “mimicking” the conditions that they had seen in other asylum seekers and refugees who have been transferred to Australia for mental health treatments.



Moreover, patients whose mental health issues were apparently severe enough to justify their transfer to Australia were returned several months later into the same conditions that doctors had identified as contributing to their trauma.



A service provider reported being aware of more than 20 such cases, some of which led to tragedy. For example, Hodan Yasin, a Somali woman who was considered suicidal, was admitted to a hospital in Australia for several months, then forcibly returned to Nauru. She was still considered highly suicidal and placed in a special ward in one of the camps, which was supposed to have 24-hour observation. However, she managed to escape, buy gasoline, and set herself on fire, burning 86 percent of her body.



More than a dozen of the adults interviewed said they had tried to kill themselves by overdosing on medication; swallowing bleach, other cleaning products, or razors; hanging or strangling themselves; or setting themselves on fire; many more said that they had seriously considered ending their lives. Some children had injured themselves with lighters, razor blades, or in other ways.



Nearly all made references to Omid Masoulmali, a 23-year-old Iranian man who died in May after setting himself alight, and to Yasin, who set herself on fire the following week. “I have the oil ready,” one man stated matter-of-factly. “I’m tired of my life,” said a 15-year-old girl, who said she had tried to commit suicide twice.



A woman whose husband had been transferred to Australia for urgent medical treatment said that their 9-year-old son had repeatedly talked about suicide after the family had been separated: “Two weeks ago, my son took the lighter. He said, ‘I want to burn myself. Why should I be alive? I want my daddy. I miss my daddy.’ I look in his eyes and I see sadness.”



Conditions in the Processing Center

For months and sometimes years after their arrival in Nauru, asylum seekers have been held in prison-like camps in the Nauru Regional Processing Centre (RPC), surrounded by fences and guarded by security services. They live in crowded tents where the heat is unbearable, even after some basic fans were installed. With humidity between 75 and 90 percent, mold grows quickly on tent walls and ceilings, and skin rashes and other infections spread rapidly. Sudden, torrential rains flood roads and pool on the tent floors. On several occasions, rains have also uncovered unexploded World War II ordnance on the detention center grounds.

Food is distributed at set times, and no one is allowed to bring any food into the tents, even for young children. Living conditions in the RPC improved after October 2015, when Nauru allowed most of those housed there greater freedom of movement.



Until early 2015, the asylum seekers could take one two-minute shower a day. Several of the women we interviewed cried recalling how guards forced them out of the shower after two minutes, shampoo still in their hair. There were long lines for toilets that quickly became so dirty that cleaners refused to clean them. They could use the Internet once a week at most, and could not leave the camp.



Most of the approximately 400 refugees and asylum seekers who remain in the RPC are allowed to leave during the day, although they are subject to monitoring by guards and other restrictions on their liberty. Smartphones are prohibited inside the camp.



One male asylum seeker said:

When we came to this place, we found tents in a jungle. They put eight families together, with six kids, young kids, under one tent. Every day, every night, we had no rest. No sleep. Every day, the kids would fight because they were so close together. Most of the day, they kept the water locked up. They just gave us a small amount. It wasn’t enough, with the strong sun. Sometimes we couldn’t shower for two or three days. The kids started getting bad skin. We suffered these problems for two years.

A woman recalled:

The tents were terrible. It was too hot, so hot you felt you couldn’t breathe. The children always felt bad because it was too hot for them. There wasn’t enough water to drink. For the shower, we had a specific time. If the children needed to take a shower at a different time, they couldn’t. Security wouldn’t let them take showers except at the specific time. After three years, children in that bad situation have mental problems. Bedwetting. Nightmares.

At the end of May 2016, according to Australia’s Department of Immigration and Border Protection, 466 people, including 50 children, were housed in the RPC. Most, if not all, continued to be housed in tents, asylum seekers said.



Immigration Department records say that the agency had completed refugee status determinations for 1,194 people held on the island, of whom 915 were recognized as refugees. The remaining 279 received negative determinations. Most recognized refugees are now housed in other camps or in houses in the community, Human Rights Watch heard from refugees and asylum seekers, but some remain in the camp while they await housing assignments. Most of those rejected for refugee status are still on the island and in the tents, although refugees and asylum seekers reported that a handful had accepted return to their home countries.



Bullying, Harassment in School

Parents and children reported that students from families of refugees and asylum seekers are frequently bullied by Nauruan students. A 15-year-old girl said that she stopped going to school because Nauruan children always tried to pull off her headscarf and constantly taunted her.



One mother said:

When they go to school, the Nauruan children call our children “refugee,” not by name. People have names. They say, “Why are you here? This is our country. You should leave. We don’t like you staying here.”

A 10-year-old girl gave a similar account:

All the kids at school, they say, “Refugee, refugee, refugee.” They don’t say our names. They hit us. And when we try to talk to the teachers, they don’t say, “Why are you Nauruan kids hitting the other kids?” They say to us, “Why are you fighting with the Nauruan kids?” We try to explain, but they don’t listen.

Two brothers, 13 and 14 years old, said they went to school for a month initially, but then stopped and haven’t attended school for almost three years. The older brother said:

Local kids kept attacking us, and even throwing stones. When we complained to the principal, the kids were made to say “sorry” to us. But when we left the principal’s office, they got even angrier at us.

Save the Children Australia estimates that 85 percent of asylum seeker and refugee children on Nauru do not attend local schools, in part because of the prevalence of bullying and harassment.



Corporate Responsibility for Abuse

Australia’s operations on Nauru rely on private companies and service providers. These service providers face penalties if they speak out, and some staff members have taken a considerable risk to do so to expose the conditions on the island. The companies that provide services on Nauru are aware of the situation and the impact on refugees and asylum seekers. The companies’ involvement facilitates the continuation of the abusive situation. The Australian and Nauruan governments would have great difficulty maintaining their Memorandum of Understanding and the offshore processing center without their services. Most are working directly on behalf of the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection.



Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch sought comment from the two key companies contracted by the Australian government to provide services for its Nauru operation: Broadspectrum, the company that runs the RPC, and IHMS, the main medical service provider. Broadspectrum responded to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch’s summary of findings that it “firmly rejected” any suggestion that the company did not respect human rights. IHMS stated that its role was to deliver services, and not to engage in Australian government policy, and “strongly refuted” the allegations put to it by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.



Dr. Peter Young, a psychiatrist who was until July 2014 IHMS’s director of mental health, commented:

It is a basic ethical requirement for doctors and other health care workers to advocate for the best health interests of their patients and to speak out against policies and practices that do harm to health. The Australian government has followed a deliberate policy to cause suffering to asylum seekers coming to Australia by boat. Being subject to abuses, lack of health services, delays in treatment, and inhumane procedures are necessary components of coercing returns and deterring others.

Health providers who accept this and do not speak out, collude with secrecy and harmful practices causing harm to health. They are caught in an irresolvable conflict of interest, breach their ethical obligations and fail to provide a satisfactory standard of care. Full clinical independence, public reporting of health data and proper independent oversight are necessary minimum standards to provide safe and ethical services.

Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch believe that their ongoing involvement in the Nauru center amounts to complicity in violations of the rights of refugees and asylum seekers. These businesses are profiting from an abusive context, and based on Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch’s investigations on the island, some are directly responsible for serious abuse and the failure to provide appropriate medical care.



An Uncertain Future

All of the refugees and asylum seekers interviewed reported that when they were sent to Nauru, immigration authorities told them they were being transferred for “processing” and would be then resettled in a third country. They said that Australian immigration authorities’ description of the time they would be held on Nauru has changed frequently since August 2013 – with every new version of the timetable accompanied by a denial that Australian officials had ever announced a different version.



At this point, even those who have received positive refugee status determinations have no idea what to expect and are unable to receive any clear answers from Nauruan or Australian authorities. They have no way of leaving the island, even if they have financial means to do so, and even when they have been issued “travel documents.” Researchers saw travel documents issued by the government of Nauru to some refugees. These papers described the nationality of the individuals as “refugee,” and refugees who have tried to apply for visas to go to other countries are rejected.

One man said:

They didn’t say how long we have refugee status for. When I came to Nauru, they said it would be five years maximum. They said within that time we would go to another country. Not Australia. After two years, they said, “You will stay in Nauru for 10 years or go to Cambodia.”

Another man said:

Even if they had said when I came to Nauru that it would be 10 years, no problem. But they said it would be a maximum of five years and then we would go to another country. Which country, I don’t know. But after two years in Nauru, the government said 10 years here or Cambodia or return home.

Another man said:

Refugee status in Nauru is not permanent. The government has only offered us temporary resettlement. They give us a travel document which is useless, because we cannot leave here. We are still in prison. We cannot leave this island.

And a woman said:

People here don’t have a real life. We are just surviving. We are dead souls in living bodies. We are just husks. We don’t have any hope or motivation.","Tue, 02 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/multimedia_images_2016/nauru_1.jpg,"['asylum', 'neglect', 'rights', 'australia', 'australian', 'human', 'appalling', 'health', 'abuse', 'medical', 'nauru', 'seekers', 'refugees']",

The university was closed indefinitely in an emergency meeting of the authorities, chaired by Chancellor Md Ali Ashraf in the chair, a local correspondent reports.

Male students have been asked to vacate by 11:00am. Female students have been asked to leave campus premises by 2:00pm. A notice has been hung at campus in this regard.

Witnesses said the infighting ensued around last midnight at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman dormitory on the first dawn of August – the month of mourning.

Khaled Saifullah, a student of marketing department of the university and a hall unit leader of BCL, sustained injuries during the incident. He later succumbed at Dhaka Medical College Hospital.

Mehedi Hassan, an assistant professor of the department, confirmed the casualty.

Factions of Chhatra League are trading blames on each other for the incident. The campus’ BCL President Nazmul Hassan blamed an ousted leader Ilias Hossain for the clash.

On the contrary, Ilias Hossain alleged that activists of Bangabandhu hall accompanied outsiders and swooped on their party. However, he could not answer what he was doing there in the first place.

The university’s proctorial body and police brought the situation under control later on. Proctor Mohammad Ainul Haque confirmed shooting during the clash and the casualty.

Comilla district police’s additional Superintendent Abdullah Al Mamun echoed similar and said one student was killed during the clash. “Gunshots were fired during the fight.”

Sources said, tension has been prevailing within Chhatra League at campus on the verge of formation of a new campus committee.","Mon, 01 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/comilla-university-gate_0.jpg?itok=_S_4Obib,"['leader', 'chhatra', 'later', 'university', 'students', 'shut', 'leaves', 'bcl', 'dead', 'student', 'infighting', 'campus', 'league', 'incident', 'comilla']",

It also came when the state government, under a chief minister who has been just three months in the saddle, was struggling with one of the worst floods that Assam has seen in recent years.

Both situations underscore the vulnerability of rural communities, as well as the fact that these are issues that government after government, no matter what party is in power, will have to contend with for a long time to come.

In the eyes of the government, there are no good terrorists or bad terrorists; in the eyes of the latter, the same holds true vis-à-vis those in power, unless they are able to inveigle a deal and benefit from the process.

In this case, the message to the newly minted and largely inexperienced Assam government as well as the BJP leadership in Delhi was loud and clear: That the group can’t be ignored and can strike at vulnerable groups.

Yet, it is a reflection of the statist view of media and the security prism of governments that the flood disaster went immediately to the backburner despite the fact that nearly two million people in a swathe of districts are affected. This is to be expected for the very nature of terrorism detracts attention from key economic, political and social challenges.

The Bodo group suspected to be involved in the killings is the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (Songbijit group). It is no stranger to acute forms of violence and is held responsible for a series of brutal killings, where its primary targets and victims have been civilians. Some news reports have said such violence was unprecedented: Nothing could be further from the truth.

The demand for a separate Bodo nation by armed groups is splattered extensively with blood.

In two incidents, both in 2014, more than 100 persons were killed when heavily armed Bodo attackers gunned down not less than 62 tribals in one incident and over 30 Muslims, mostly women and children, in their villages.

The Bodo movement, which first sought a separate state to be carved out of Assam, was initially peaceful as it called for the protection of rights, identity and land.

Read | How and why the Kokrajhar attack in Assam took place

However, when hardliners took over, it lurched towards separatism in the1990s, demanding ‘independence’. That drew both young men and women into an armed movement led by the founder of the NDFB, Ranjan Daimary, who was based – as was the leadership of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), another major armed group fighting Indian forces – in Bhutan and Bangladesh.

The Centre created up an autonomous council that gave basic powers of funding, political patronage and development to the local leadership but this did not appease the hardliners.

In 2003, Bhutanese royal troops routed insurgent groups based in the southern part of their country. Hundred died. Some leaders were captured, others escaped to Bangladesh and Myanmar.

A few years later, the Bangladesh government handed over a clutch of militant leaders including Dairmary, who was named in a massive explosion that shook Guwahati in 2008, as well as ULFA Chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa, dealing a stunning blow to the groups.

As Daimary’s influence waned, power shifted to his one-time aide, Songbijit. Although Songbijit and his lieutenants are often based in camps near the Indo-Myanmar border, and have access to weapons and explosives, a number of hit squads are said to be located on the India-Bhutan border which is close to Kokrajhar, enabling a quick getaway.

The killings highlight a number of issues: for one, the armed groups have asserted that they cannot be ignored, no matter who is in power.

It has drawn attention away from stressful conditions in the Bodoland Territorial Council for non-Bodos. It demonstrates the extreme vulnerability of this beautiful yet politically broken region. The real issues, not just floods and livelihoods, but also of encroachment on land, forests and living spaces which have affected ordinary Bodos and others living in the region are lost sight of.

Dorsey"" class=""author url fn"" rel=""author"">James M. Dorsey</a>

Continued doubts about the longevity of the Saudi ruling family are fuelled by its Faustian bargain with Wahhabism — a conservative, intolerant, discriminatory and anti-pluralistic interpretation of Islam.1

It is a bargain that has produced one of the largest dedicated public diplomacy campaigns in history. Estimates of Saudi Arabia’s spending on support of ultra-conservative strands of Islam, including Wahhabism, Salafism and Deobandism, across the globe range from $70 to $100 billion. Saudi largesse funded mosques, Islamic schools and cultural institutions, and social services, as well as the forging of close ties to non-Wahhabi Muslim leaders and intelligence agencies in various Muslim nations. In doing so, Saudi Arabia succeeded in turning its largely local Wahhabi and like-minded ultra-conservative Muslim worldviews into an influential force in Muslim nations and communities across the globe.2

The campaign is not simply a product of the marriage between the Al Sauds and the Wahhabis. It is central to Saudi Arabia’s soft power policy and the Al Sauds’ survival strategy. One reason, albeit not the only one, that the longevity of the Al Sauds is a matter of debate, is the fact that the propagation of Wahhabism is having a backlash in countries across the globe, as well as on Saudi Arabia itself. More than ever before, Wahhabism, and its theological parent, Salafism, are being put under the spotlight due to their theological or ideological similarities with jihadism in general, and the ideology of the Islamic State (IS) group in particular.

Speaking at a conference in Singapore, sociologist Farid Alatas noted that madrassas — often funded by Saudi Arabia or other Salafi and Wahhabi groups — fails to produce graduates trained to think critically. “They have not been exposed to [Muslim] intellectuals like Ibn Khaldoun,” Alatas said “That is the opportunity for Salafis and Wahhabis” in the absence of Muslim scholars who would be capable of debunking their myths he added. Alatas was referring to Abd al-Raḥman ibn Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad ibn Abi Bakr Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥasan Ibn Khaldun, the 14th century historian, who is widely seen as one of the fathers of modern sociology, historiography, demography and economics.

Taking Wahhabism’s influence in Malaysia as an example, Alatas pointed to the uncontested distribution of a sermon by the religious department of the Malaysian state of Selangor, that asserted that women who fail to wear a hijab invite rape and resemble a fish that attracts flies.3

Such attitudes fostered by Saudi funding, as well as Saudi Arabia’s willingness to look the other way when its youth leave the kingdom to join militant groups, undermine Saudi Arabia’s international image and its efforts to create soft power. “It is often alleged that the Saudis export terrorism. They don’t, but what they have done is encourage their own radicals – a natural by-product of Wahhabism, Saudi Arabia’s conservative brand of Islam – to commit their terrorist acts elsewhere. As the radicals leave, so does Saudi money, which funds their violent activities,” said former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, Christopher R. Hill.4

The estimated 2,500 Saudis who have joined IS constitute the group’s second largest national contingent.5

The problem for the Al Sauds is not just that their image is under attack and that their legitimacy is wholly dependent on their identification with Wahhabism; it is also that the Al Sauds since the launch of their Islamist campaign, have often been only nominally in control of it. As a result, the Al Sauds have let a genie out of the bottle that now leads an independent life and cannot be put back into the bottle. Wahhabi and Salafi-influenced education systems played into the hands of Arab autocrats, who for decades dreaded an education system that would teach critical thinking and the asking of difficult questions.

Saudi funding of conservative Islamic learning neatly aligned itself in Pakistan, which has an education system shaped by the partition of British India into predominantly Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan. This emphasis on religious nationalism, where minorities are perceived as being inferior, involved a parochial definition of what it meant to be Muslim in Pakistan.6 The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) reported that Pakistani public school textbooks — circulated to at least 41 million children — contained derogatory references to religious minorities. The perception of minorities as threats was reinforced with the enhanced Islamisation of textbooks in the decade from 1978 to 1988, in which General Zia ul Haq-ruled Pakistan.7

“In public school classrooms, Hindu children are forced to read lessons about ‘Hindus’ conspiracies toward Muslims’, and Christian children are taught that ‘Christians learned tolerance and kind- heartedness from Muslims.’ This represents a public shaming of religious minority children that begins at a very young age, focusing on their religious and cultural identity and their communities’ past history. A review of the curriculum demonstrates that public school students are being taught that religious minorities, especially Christians and Hindus, are nefarious, violent, and tyrannical by nature. There is a tragic irony in these accusations, because Christians and Hindus in Pakistan face daily persecution, are common victims of crime, and are frequent targets of deadly communal violence, vigilantism, and collective punishment,” USCIRF report concluded.8

“By imposing the harsh, literal interpretation of religion exported and promoted by Saudi Arabia, we have turned Pakistan into a drab, monochromatic landscape where colour, laughter, dancing and music are frowned upon, if not entirely banned. And yet Islam in South Asia was once characterised by a life-enhancing Sufi tradition that is now under threat. More and more, we are following the example set by the Taliban,” added Pakistani writer Irfan Husain.9 A Pew Research survey moreover concluded in late 2015 that 78 percent of Pakistanis favoured strict implementation if Islamic law.10

Syed Imran Ali Shah, whose father was murdered when he was a child, was 16 when in 1999 he was admitted to Mercy Pak School in Peshawar, an educational institution funded by Saudi-backed Mercy International Pakistan. Zahid al-Sheikh, the brother of 9/11 mastermind Khalid al-Sheikh, was one of the charity’s executives in the second half of the 1980s and the 1990s, a time when Saudi Arabia joined the United States in financing the Pakistan-based resistance against the Soviets in Afghanistan.11 Syed Imran says his radicalization was spurred by one of his teachers all of whom were in his words Wahhabis. The teacher argued the importance of jihad in his sermons.12 Jihad never figured in the school’s curriculum but students learned to believe that the beliefs and practices of other sects were heresy. ”We teach students the aqeedah (creed) of every sect and tell them as to how and where that aqeedah is wrong so that we can guide them to the right aqeedah,” said Umer bin Abdul Aziz of the Jaimatul Asar madrassa in Peshawar.13 Based on textual analysis of madrassa texts, scholar Niaz Muhammad warned that “no one should claim that their statements about the madrassa curriculum have nothing to do with sectarianism or other forms of religious militancy.”14

In a seminar moderated by Jordanian scholar Nadia Oweidat at the New America Foundation in Washington, D.C., on 3 May 2016, Ahmed Abdellahy, a reformed, former Egyptian jihadist, described being educated in a school system that divided the world into ‘us and them’. ‘Us’ were the Muslims who had been victimised by ‘them’. Abdellahy said he was taught that: ‘they’, the Christians, Westerners and “all the world is against us [Muslims] because we are better than them.” Abdellahy said. He said this was an attitude engraved in generations of children who were expected to accept it at face value. “When I was going to school, the role of the school was to stop you from questioning,” Oweidat added.15 The inability of Abdellahy’s school teachers to answer students’ probing questions and a lack of available literature drove him to the Internet, where militant Islamists provided answers.16

The current backlash of Saudi support for autocracy and funding of the export of Wahhabism and Salafism, coupled with the need to radically reform the kingdom’s economy, means that the Al Sauds and the Wahhabis are nearing a crunch point, one that will not necessarily offer solutions, but in fact could make things worse. It risks sparking ever more militant splits, that will make themselves felt across the Muslim world and in minority Muslim communities elsewhere, in multiple ways.

One already visible fallout of the Saudi campaign is greater intolerance towards minorities and increased sectarianism in countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Malaysia. In Pakistan, for example, a U.S. Foreign Service officer, noted that in Saudi-funded “madrassas, children are denied contact with the outside world and taught sectarian extremism, hatred for non-Muslims, and anti-Western/anti-Pakistan government philosophy.”17

The recent shooting in the southern Philippines of Sheikh Aaidh al-Qarni, a prominent Saudi Wahhabi cleric whose popularity is evident in his following of 12 million on Twitter, further suggests that the backlash for the kingdom is not just the Saudi government emerging as a target but also the ulema18 — including ulema who are not totally subservient to the Saudi government. Sheikh Aaidh al-Qarni is a product of the fusion between Wahhabism and the Muslim Brotherhood that produced the Sahwa, a Saudi Salafist political reform movement.

While Philippine investigators are operating on the assumption that the Islamic State (IS) group was responsible for the shooting, Saudi media were quick to report that Saudi authorities had warned the Philippines days earlier that Iran’s Revolutionary Guards were planning an attack.19

A key to understanding the Saudi funding campaign is the fact that while it all may be financed out of one pot of money, it serves different purposes for different parties. For the Wahhabi ulema, it is about proselytization, about the spreading of Islam; for the Saudi government, it is about gaining soft power. At times the interests of the government and the ulema coincide, and at times they diverge. By the same token, the Saudi campaign on some levels has been an unparalleled success, on others, success is questionable and one could argue that it risks becoming a liability for the government.

Problematic Soft Power

It may be hard to conceive of Wahhabism as soft power, but the fact of the matter is that Salafism was a movement that had only sprouted miniscule communities in the centuries preceding the rise of Mohammed ibn Abdul Wahhab, and only started to make real inroads into Muslim communities beyond the Arabian Peninsula 175 years after the death of the 18th century preacher. By the 1980s, the Saudi campaign had established Wahhabi Salafism as an integral part of the global community of Muslims, and sparked greater conservative religiosity in various Arab countries as well as the emergence of Islamist movements and organisations.20 The soft power aspect of it, certainly in relation to the power struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has paid off, particularly in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Maldives, where sectarian attitudes and attitudes towards minorities, particularly Shiites, and Iran are hardening.

In Indonesia, for example, where recently retired deputy head of Indonesian intelligence and former deputy head of Nahdlatul Ulema (NU), one of the world’s largest Islamic movements that prides itself on its anti-Wahhabism, professes in the same breath his dislike of the Wahhabis and warns that Shiites are one of the foremost domestic threats to Indonesian national security. Shiites constitute 1.2 percent of the Indonesian population, including the estimated 2 million Sunni converts over the last 40 years. A fluent Arabic speaker who spent years in Saudi Arabia as the representative of Indonesian intelligence, this intelligence and religious official is not instinctively anti-Shiite, but sees Shiites as an Iranian fifth wheel. In other words, the impact of Saudi funding and Salafism is such that even NU is forced to adopt Wahhabi language and concepts when it comes to perceptions of the threat posed by Iran and Shiites.21

Wahhabi influence has meant that “the nature of South Asian Islam has significantly changed in the last three decades,” said international relations scholar and columnist Akhilesh Pillalamarri.22 Pillalamarri argued that “the result has been an increase in Islamist violence in Pakistan, Indian Kashmir, and Bangladesh. While governments in South Asia have not initially made the connection between Saudi Arabian money and the radicalization of Islam in their own countries, it is now clear that Wahhabism’s spread is increasing conservatism in South Asia…. As a result, many South Asians are now Wahhabis or members of related sects that practice a form of austere Islam similar to the type found in Saudi Arabia. One of these sects is a conservative movement known as the Deobandi movement, long one of the largest recipients of Saudi funding,23 which, while indigenous to South Asia, is influenced by Wahhabism,” Pillalamarri said.24 He was referring to the Deobandi school of Islam, the most influential sponsor of Islamic education in Pakistan and Afghanistan’s Pashtun belt founded in the 19th century.25

Many of the madrassas were initially Pakistani state sponsored, particularly during Zia’s rule. The funding was part of Zia’s Saudi-backed aim to Islamise the country as a whole. “The global Islamic reassertion spearheaded by Saudi Arabia and Arab petro-dollars was making itself felt in Pakistan. There were unmistakable signs of the Saudi impact on Zia’s locally honed ideological agenda,” says South Asia scholar Ayesha Jalal.26 Zia would handout as gifts and awards the writings of Sayyid Abul- A’la Maududi, a Saudi-backed scholar whose Jamaati-i-Islami party advocated the creation of an Islamic state. Maududi, who was arrested in 1977, was released from prison by Zia’s predecessor, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, at Saudi Arabia’s request. Maududi used his regained freedom to back the coup that would topple Bhutto and bring Zia to power. Maududi was reported to have met with Zia for 90 minutes before Bhutto was executed.27

Zia’s funding of the madrassas dried up when he suddenly died in 1988 in a mysterious plane crash. “We then had to turn to charitable donors at home and abroad for funds to meet our expenditure. How else do you expect us to finance our expenditure?” says Pir Saifullah Khalid, the founder of the Jamia Manzoorul Islamia seminary, a sprawling semi-circular complex of multi-storey classrooms and hostel blocks with a courtyard in the middle, in Lahore Cantonment’s Saddar area.28

The mushrooming of militant Deobandi, Wahhabi and Salafi mosques, often Saudi-funded, has led Pakistani authorities to link scores of madrassas to political violence.29 Hundreds have been closed in the past years. The Crime Monitoring Cell of the police inspector general in Sindh has reported that in 2015, 167 madrassas were closed, of the province’s 6,503 with a collective student population of 290,000. It was also reported that there were another 3,087 unregistered madrassas that cater to approximately 234,000 students.30

Deobandis, like Wahhabis and Salafis, advocate theological conservatism and oppose liberal ideals and values, and like its theological cousins, run the gamut from those who are apolitical and focus exclusively on religion, to militant Islamists who empathise with jihadists and see seizure of power as the way to implement the Sharia and change social behaviour. These various ultra-conservative sects, irrespective of their attitude towards politics and violence, benefit from the fact that with the government’s failing to invest in quality public education, madrassas have turned into institutions of rote learning for the poor. These madrassas evade conveying understanding of the Quran, and are a far cry from the institutions of religious and scientific learning in the first centuries of Islam that produced intellectuals, scholars and scientists.

The luminaries of modern-day, ultra-conservative madrassas, include the likes of Sami ul Haq, the scion of a Deobandi cleric, and former senator who founded the Darul Uloom Haqqania madrassah in the town of Akora Khattak in Pakistan. Ul Haq is widely seen as the father of the Taliban. Ul Haq argued in a book published in 2015 that the Afghan Taliban provided good government, Osama bin Laden was an “ideal man” and that Al Qaeda never existed.31 Ul Haq had vowed not to stop his students from interrupting their studies to join the Taliban and awarded Mullah Omar, the late Taliban leader, an honorary degree. The 2007 plot that led to the killing of prominent Pakistani politician and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was believed to have been hatched in meetings in Akora Khattak.32 A senior Pakistani interior ministry official said that, all in all, “most of the terrorist attacks during the last three years could be traced back to madrassas.”33 The militancy among Pakistani Deobandis persuaded more than 100,000 of the movement’s scholars to issue a fatwa (religious ruling) denouncing violence and terrorism as un-Islamic in 2008.34

Columnist Pillalamarri dates the expansion of Saudi and Wahhabi influence in Pakistan to the US-Saudi sponsored jihadist resistance against Soviet occupation in the 1980s that created the basis for the funding of thousands of madrassas, that at the time often offered education, shelter and food to the most impoverished who otherwise may not have had an opportunity to go to school. “Initially, the mushrooming of Wahhabi and Deobandi groups worked to produce mujahedeen [freedom fighters] to fight in the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Later, elements of the Pakistani government, notably the Pakistani intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), saw the spread of Wahhabism as useful in creating jihadist proxies to influence Afghanistan and Indian Kashmir. As a result, despite the end of the Soviet-Afghan war in 1989, the influence of Wahhabism continued to grow in Pakistan,” Pillalamarri said.

Proselytization of Wahhabism was facilitated by an agreement in the 1970s between the Pakistani and Saudi governments to promote the Arabic language and Islamic literature in Pakistan.35 The influx of sectarian, anti-Shiite Wahhabi materials grew exponentially with the jihad against the Soviets in Afghanistan. The International Crisis Group (ICG) concluded that “Saudi patronage has played a particularly important role in promoting jihadi madrasas and jihadi culture in Pakistan.”36

Saudi-sponsored non-governmental organisations like the Muslim World League, which fell under the auspices of the kingdom’s grand mufti but was populated by Muslim Brotherhood operatives and aimed to spread Wahhabism beyond the kingdom’s borders, opened offices across the globe, including South Asia. Wahhabi texts, including translations of the Quran, and the writings of Maududi and Sayed Qutb, were distributed in Muslim communities in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, the United States and Europe. Wahhabi imams (religious leaders) were dispatched to build madrassas with Saudi curricula offering free education to the poor. Wahhabi beliefs were at the same time exported when migrant workers returned home from the kingdom grateful for the opportunity to earn money to support their families.

Once back from the kingdom, many of the workers prayed in Saudi-funded mosques and adopted Wahhabi and/or Salafi practices. “People go to the Middle East and come back thinking a certain way. There’s Wahhabi money flowing in,” states International Relations scholar Amena Mohsin, whose maid in Bangladesh returned from a visit to her village fully covered. “It gives her an increased status. In that area, near Chittagong, by and large everyone supports the Hefazat-e-Islam, a conservative group opposed to Bangladesh’s secular education and women’s rights policy,” she adds.37 Hefazat was founded in 2010 by attendees of Wahhabi mosques in Bangladesh.38

Evident Risks

The risk embedded in the ultra-conservatism of Wahhabism and Salafism is further evident in Bangladesh, a secular Muslim state, with militant Islamists waging a brutal and murderous campaign against liberal and secular intellectuals, bloggers, and publishers, and carries out attacks on Christians, Hindus and Shiites. The attacks were largely the work of Islamic State and Al Qaeda operatives, but were built on the nurturing of a radical, intolerant environment by Saudi-funded institutions and Bangladeshi workers who had returned from the kingdom with a far more conservative and black-and-white worldview.

Saudi influence was also discernible in Bangladesh’s gradual move away from secularism, which was a pillar of the country’s first constitution after it broke away from Pakistan and became independent in 1971. The kingdom only recognised Bangladesh after the assassination of the country’s founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975. President Ziaur Rahman two years later removed secularism from the constitution, paving the way for the establishment of formal diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. Military leader General Hussain Muhammad Ershad completed the process in 1988 by making Islam the state religion.39 The kingdom reportedly funded Jamaat-e-Islami, a leading Islamist party, whose leaders were charged with war crimes during the country’s war of independence. Several Jamaat leaders were sentenced to death. Saudi Arabia lobbied unsuccessfully in 2013 to stay the execution of Jamaat leader Abdul Quader Molla, but refrained from doing so in 2015 in the case of Muhammad Kamaruzzaman and the party’s general secretary, Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid. Analysts said the kingdom was willing to sacrifice its Bangladeshi political allies in a bid to ensure the country’s support in its regional power struggle with Iran.40

The cooperation with ISI and other Pakistani government agencies and officials turned Saudi Arabia from a funder into a player in domestic Pakistani affairs. Adel al Jubeir who at the time was an official of the Saudi embassy in Washington, told U.S. diplomats at a lunch in Riyadh during a 2007 visit to the kingdom by Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf: “We in Saudi Arabia are not observers in Pakistan, we are participants.”41 US Charge D ’Affaires in Riyadh, Michael G. Foeller, reporting in a cable to the State Department on the Musharraf visit, noted that “the Saudis have an economic hold on Nawaz Sharif…. Sharif was reportedly the first non-Saudi to receive a special economic development loan from the SAG [Saudi Arabian Government], with which to develop a business”.42 He was at the time in the kingdom in exile. Sharif has since become Pakistan’s Prime Minister.

The degree to which Saudi paranoia about Shiites dictated the kingdom’s efforts to influence Pakistani politics through check book diplomacy was evident in State Department reporting on Saudi-Pakistani relations in the waning years of the first decade of the 21st century. One cable, detailing discussions in 2009 between U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feltman and United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed, quoted the UAE official as saying, “Saudi Arabia suspects that [then Pakistani President Asif Ali] Zardari is Shia, thus creating Saudi concern of a Shia triangle in the region between Iran, the Maliki government in Iraq, and Pakistan under Zardari.” Feltman noted that, in response, there was a pattern of Saudi Arabia withholding pledges in international frameworks for financial support of Pakistan.43

A State Department cable a year earlier in 2008 quoted the Pakistani Deputy Chief of Mission in Washington, D.C., Sarfraz Khanzada, saying that Saudi-Pakistani relations were “under strain” because the Saudis had no confidence in Zardari. Khanzada said Saudi financial assistance to Pakistan had dropped sharply. The Saudis had not provided “a single drop” of oil on promised concessionary terms. Instead, they had given Pakistan a single $300 million check, considerably less than in previous years. “Beggars can’t be choosers,” Khanzada had said, adding that the Saudis were “waiting for the Zardari government to fall.”44 Pakistan’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Umar Khan Alisherzai, told U.S. diplomats in 2009 that “we have been punished by Saudi Arabia because our president talks to the Iranians.”45

Then Saudi Interior Minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayef went a step further, advising U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke that the Saudis view “the Pakistan Army as the strongest element for stability in the country.” Bin Nayef described the Pakistani military as the Saudis’ “winning horse” and Pakistan’s “best bet.” The Saudi official said that instability in Pakistan or tension between Pakistan and India posed a threat to Saudi Arabia’s stability, because of the 800,000 Pakistani and one million Indians employed in the kingdom.46

Author and former Pakistani ambassador to the United States Hussain Haqqani estimated that Saudi Arabia donated more than $2 billion to the Islamist resistance against the Soviets.47 The investment, alongside that of the United States and others, fundamentally changed Pakistani society and the country’s power structure. ISI, supported by Saudi Arabia and the United States, exploited its role as the recruiter, trainer and operations manager of the Afghan mujahedeen to expand and legitimise ISI’s role as a key arbitrator of Pakistani politics by manipulating the government’s allies and intimidating its opponents.48

Moreover, direct Saudi funding as well as support by the Muslim World League of Jamaat-e-Islami — the Pakistani wing of a movement founded in 1941 by theologian and philosopher Abul Ala Maududi — became a launching pad for Saudi-backed ultra-conservatism into then still communist Central Asia.49

The movement’s Afghan wing was headed by figures who would play key roles in the ultimate defeat of the Soviets and the rise of Wahhabi-influenced conservatism and Islamism in the country. Burhannudin Rabbani, the theology professor, twice became President of Afghanistan. Rabbani’s students included Ahmad Shah Massoud, a legendary Tajik military commander in the fight against the Soviets and Afghanistan’s subsequent civil war, who was killed by Al Qaeda on the eve of 9/11; and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a two-time Prime Minister, whose Hezb-e-Islami party received the lion’s share of Saudi funding for the mujahedeen.50

Hekmatyar, the instigator of Afghanistan’s civil war in the 1990s, that in Kabul alone killed more than 50,000 people, was best known for his targeting of those Muslims denounced as idolaters – just like the Wahhabis at the beginning of the 20th century. Hekmatyar spent “more time fighting other mujahedeen than killing Soviets,” quipped journalist and author Peter Bergen.51 Abdul Rab Rasul Sayyaf, a Saudi-funded Wahhabi Islamic Law scholar, politician and warlord, who split with Rabbani and Hekmatyar to form his own group of mujahedeen, is believed to have facilitated Osama Bin Laden’s return to Afghanistan in 198652 after the Saudi was expelled from Sudan and assisted Masood’s assassins.53

Then Pakistani leader Zia-ul-Haq encouraged Saudi charities to build mosques and madrassas for the large number of Afghans fleeing the war to Pakistan as well as for Pakistanis themselves. With little prospect of employment, refugee camps became recruitment centres for Saudi-funded mujahedeen. Volunteers from across the globe were welcomed to train alongside the mujahedeen’s refugee recruits funded by the Muslim World League.54

To help Pakistan alleviate the cost of hosting large numbers of Afghan refugees, Saudi Arabia hired hundreds of thousands of Pakistani migrant workers whose remittances boosted Pakistan’s economic growth. Many of the workers eventually returned home imbued with Wahhabism’s conservative values. The same was true for Pakistani troops enlisted to assist in fortifying the kingdom’s security in a deal mediated by the United States.

“Pakistani workers in the Gulf and their families became either sympathetic or indifferent to Islamization. The expatriate workers were also influenced by Islamist missionaries backed by Saudi Arabia’s Wahhabi establishment during the course of their stay in the Gulf states,” Haqqani, the former Pakistani ambassador, noted.55

A Case in Point

The history of Tashfeen Malik is a case in point. Her experience and that of her family is indicative of the kind of tensions adherence to Wahhabism’s narrow mindset can foster. Malik moved with her parents to Saudi Arabia when she was a toddler. The two decades in Saudi Arabia persuaded the family to abandon their Sufi practices that included visiting shrines, honouring saints and enjoying Sufi trance music — practices rejected by the kingdom’s Wahhabism. The change sparked tensions with relatives in Pakistan, whom the Maliks accused in Wahhabi fashion of rejecting the oneness of God by revering saints. Syed Nisar Hussain Shah, an academic at Bahauddin Zakariya University in Malik’s native Pakistani town of Multan, whose madrassas are known as jihadist nurseries, where she studied Pharmacology, recalls Malik seeking assistance because her conservative norms clashed with more the comparatively more liberal values of her dormitory mates. “She told me, ‘my parents live in Saudi Arabia, and I am not getting along with my roommates and cannot adjust with them, so can you help me?’” Shah recalls.56

While in Pakistan, Malik studied Islam for 18 months at the Al-Huda Institute, a religious school with branches in Britain, the United States, Canada, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka that propagates non-violent Wahhabism.57 Students at Islamabad’s Islamic International University, whose mosque was donated by Saudi Arabia and whose foreign liaisons are primarily Saudi universities, are encouraged to attend religious classes at Al Huda.58 Cultural anthropologist Sadaf Ahmad describes Al Huda as a “school-turned-social movement.”59 Former students of Al Huda describe a curriculum that educates them in puritan Islam, encourages them to isolate themselves from the outside world and view it as hostile, and in some cases, brings vulnerable youth to the edge of radicalism. Al Huda’s Toronto branch closed its doors in December 2015 following news reports that four of its students had attempted to join IS.60 After enrolling in Al Huda, Malik donned a hijab, refrained from communication with the opposite sex, and spent most of her time studying the Quran.61

“Women would often weep, overcome by religiosity. We were constantly taught that this path was our choice, but also that not choosing it was the way of sin. Gradually, perhaps because I was far from my family, young and troubled, and my education in Britain had provided me with little secular knowledge, I was completely sucked in… Only in retrospect do I realise that essentially I’d been brainwashed into something resembling a cult… I feel that al-Huda’s literalist, conservative interpretation of Islam, which discouraged criticism or dissent, built a fire. It laid down the kindling, the twigs, the wood, ready for a match. And the flames swept in from two directions. First, from geopolitical events: the discourse of Muslim oppression that has gained force across the world, which Islamic State, among others, uses so powerfully. Yet it also requires an internal fire, something within an individual that will ignite fundamentalist theology into violent action. Most women who leave al-Huda institute are zealous for a while, but the sheer intensity requires so much emotional energy that it invariably fizzles out… This happened to me… Yet there was a time when I was lonely, isolated, a troubled girl with nothing but my all-encompassing faith, when I know that a spark could have been ignited within me. I walked on. Tashfeen Malik lit the fire,” said Aliyah Saleem.62

“All her students, who you would think after coming closer to God, would become more tolerant and at peace, have always showed the opposite result. They became intolerant, judgmental and arrogant instead… There is no real proof to back the theory that Al-Huda brainwashed Tashfeen and others into terrorism, but one thing that is for sure is that Madame Hashmi’s [Al-Huda co-founder Farhat Hashmi] institute promotes unhealthy fanaticism and an orthodox manner of thinking. And that could very well turn one into a cold blooded murderer given just the right push; all in hopes to getting in heaven,” added former student Shamila Ghiyas, who had attended several classes given by Al-Huda co-founder Farhat Hashmi.63

Mosharraf Zaidi, an Islamabad-based columnist who specialises in education issues, argues that if Malik was radicalised while studying in Pakistan, “it was because she was exposed to ways of thinking that these schools have helped to promote. They require people to isolate themselves from modernity [outright] — television is wrong, eating McDonald’s is wrong, mixing with the opposite gender is wrong. And once you establish that isolation, then dehumanising people is easy…and if you leave someone there, you have left them on a cliff.”64

For people like Malik raised in a Wahhabi environment, as well as those who were not, jihadism’s appeal is in part the absolutism that ultra-conservative strands of Islam project. Both apolitical or non-violent ultra-conservatism and jihadism see the acknowledgement of God’s oneness and His sovereignty as the prime drivers of a believer’s life. All other aspects of life, including family relationships, are secondary to that, which explains why adherents of the Islamic State and other jihadist groups often break from their families, as well as their past. Wahhabis dedicate their lives to prayer, study of religious texts and mosque attendance; jihadis add the dimension of holy war. Their dedication is rooted in Ibn Abd al Wahhab’s assertion that “worship of Allah cannot be performed until taghut (polytheism) is denounced and rejected.”65

Educational Vacuum

Al Huda and Malik’s example highlights the educational vacuum in Pakistan, that militant strands of Islam, including Wahhabism, Salafism and jihadism are able to exploit in a country with a poor educational infrastructure and one of the world’s lowest education budgets.66 Pakistan’s some 26,000 madrassas graduate an estimated 200,000 students a year.67 To be sure, the madrassas run the gamut in terms of theological orientation and quality. They also run from mud-walled structures with rote memorisation of the Quran at their core, to sophisticated institutions like Al Huda, to outright jihadi conveyor belts. A Harvard Kennedy School study put enrolment in madrassas at only 7.5 percent of all children enrolled in Pakistani schools. It argued that enrolment had remained constant much of the first decade of the 21st century.68 By contrast, the International Crisis Group estimated that 1.5 million students were enrolled in Pakistani madrassas in 2002.69

Nonetheless, a 2008 cable from the U.S. consulate in Lahore reported that “financial support estimated at nearly US $100 million annually was making its way to (conservative) Deobandi and Ahl-e-Hadith clerics in the region from ‘missionary’ and ‘Islamic charitable’ organisations in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, ostensibly with the direct support of those governments…”70 U.S. diplomat Bryan Hunt estimated in the cable that up to 200 madrassas in southern Punjab, in towns like Multan as well in Dera Ghazi Khan — a juncture of all four of Pakistan’s provinces — and in the central city of Bahawalpur, served as recruitment grounds for militant Islamist groups.

The consulate’s principle officer, Hunt, reported in his cable to authorities in Washington that the funding had spawned a “network (that) reportedly exploited worsening poverty in these areas…to recruit children into the divisions’ growing Deobandi and Ahl-el Hadith madrassa network from which they were indoctrinated into jihadi philosophy, deployed to regional training/indoctrination centres, and ultimately sent to terrorist training camps in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).” He said families with a large number of children who face financial difficulty as a result of inflation, poor crop yields, and growing unemployment are targeted for recruitment.71

Hunt said Gulf funding of charitable activities of charities that fronted for groups like Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and Jaish-e-Mohammed that had been proscribed by the U.S. Treasury, had increased the local population’s dependence on extremist groups and undermined the influence of moderate Sufi religious leaders. Hunt said that the charities targeted boys up to the age of 15. The funds, the diplomat said, had officially been transferred to Pakistan to assist victims of a 2008 earthquake in Kashmir and the North West Frontier Province. “Locals believe that a portion of these funds was siphoned to Deobandi and Ahl-e-Hadith clerics in southern and western Punjab in order to expand these sects’ presence in a traditionally hostile, but potentially fruitful, recruiting ground. The initial success of establishing madrassas and mosques in these areas led to subsequent annual ‘donations’ to these same clerics, originating in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Hunt said”72

The U.S. diplomat suggested that the influence of officials in key positions in the Pakistan bureaucracy, who were sympathetic to Deobandi and Ahl-e-Hadith, had thwarted efforts by Sufi and other religious scholars to persuade the government to crackdown on extremist funding. “The brother of the Federal Minister for Religious Affairs, and a noted Brailvi/Sufi scholar in his own right, Allama Qasmi, blamed government intransigence on a culture that rewarded political deals with religious extremists. He stressed that even if political will could be found, the bureaucracy in Religious Affairs, Education, and Defence Ministries remained dominated by (former president) Zia ul Haq appointees, who favoured the Deobandi and Ahl-e-Hadith religious ideologies. This bureaucracy, Qasmi claimed, had repeatedly blocked his brother’s efforts to push policy in a different direction,” Hunt reported.73

Describing in detail how Saudi funds were put to work, Hunt reported that “the local Deobandi or Ahl-e-Hadith maulana (religious scholar) will generally be introduced to the family through these (charitable) organisations. He will work to convince the parents that their poverty is a direct result of their family’s deviation from ‘the true path of Islam’ through ‘idolatrous’ worship at local Sufi shrines and/or with local Sufi Peers. The maulana suggests that the quickest way to return to ‘favour’ would be to devote the lives of one or two of their sons to Islam. The maulana will offer to educate these children at his madrassa and to find them employment in the service of Islam. The concept of ‘martyrdom’ is often discussed and the family is promised that if their sons are ‘martyred’ both the sons and the family will attain ‘salvation’ and the family will obtain God’s favour in this life, as well. An immediate cash payment is finally made to the parents to compensate the family for its ‘sacrifice’ to Islam. Local sources claim that the current average rate is approximately Rs. 500,000 (approximately US$ 6,500) per son,” Hunt wrote.74

Hunt said the children were sent to one of up to 200 madrassas located in isolated areas where they are prevented to have contact with the outside world and inculcated with “sectarian extremism, hatred for non-Muslims, and anti-Western/anti-Pakistan government philosophy. Graduates from the school are either employed as clerics and teacher or move on to jihadist training camps.75

The infusion of Saudi money and Wahhabism into Deobandi schools, some of which have produced many of the Taliban’s leaders, including Mullah Mohammed Omar, the group’s supreme commander and spiritual guide who reportedly died in 2013; and Jalaluddin Haqqani, a powerful commander, has changed the very nature of the movement. ‘As Pakistan’s economy and politics have moved towards West Asia, and away from an Indian history and past, its various Islams have also been influenced by these trends. Pakistan’s version of Deobandi Islam is affected by Saudi Wahhabism, and hence it becomes difficult to argue that these madrassas are still in any sense Deobandi… Islam, even Pakistani and Afghani Islam, is now globalised, Wahhabised, as well as affected by geopolitical influences, which have a far-reaching impact on local and domestic Islam,” said scholar of International Relations, S. Akbar Zaidi.76

U.S. Democratic senator Chris Murphy took the example of a possible parent in a small town in northwest Pakistan, to depict her/his vulnerability. “You’re illiterate, you’re poor, you’re getting poorer by the day, unemployment in your village is sky high, inflation is making everything unaffordable, your crop yields have been terrible. And one day, you get a visit that changes your perspective. A cleric from a nearby conservative mosque offers you a different path. He tells you that your poverty is not your fault, but simply a punishment handed down to you because of your unintentional deviation from the true path of Islam. And luckily, there’s a way to get right with God, to devote your son’s life to Islam. And it gets even better, because the cleric’s going to educate your son in his own school, we call them madrassas, and not only will you not have to pay for the education, he’ll actually pay you… And when your son finishes school he’ll get employment in the service of Islam,” Murphy said.77

“And so for thousands of families in destitute places like northwest Pakistan, it’s a pretty easy choice,” Murphy said. “But as you go on, you lose contact with your son. Gradually, the school cuts off your access to him. When you do see him, now and again, he’s changing. And then one day it’s over. He’s not the little boy you once knew. He’s a teenager, announcing to you that the only way to show true faith to Islam is to fight for it against the kafir, the infidels who are trying to pollute the Muslim faith, and against the Westerners who are trying to destroy it. He tells you that he’s going off to Afghanistan, or Syria, or Iraq with some fellow students, and that you shouldn’t worry about him because God is on his side,” Murphy added.78

The parents try to find out what happened at the school for their son to become a jihadist. “You discover the textbooks that he read, that taught a brand of Islam greatly influenced by something called Wahhabism… I tell you this story because, as you know, some version of it plays out hundreds of times every day in far-flung places, from Pakistan to Kosovo, from Nigeria to Indonesia — the teaching of an intolerant version of Islam to hundreds of millions of young people. In 1956, there were 244 madrassas in Pakistan. Today there are 24,000. So these schools are multiplying all over the globe. And don’t get me wrong, these schools, by and large, they don’t teach violence. They aren’t the minor leagues for extremist groups. But they do teach a version of Islam that leads very nicely into an anti-Shia, anti-Western militancy,” Murphy said.79

The pervasiveness in Pakistan of Saudi-backed ultra-conservative-inspired militant Islamist ideology was on full display in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad when authorities opted to shut down all cell phone coverage during Friday prayers to prevent dissemination of a sermon by Maulana Abdul Aziz, rather than detain the jihadist imam. Abdul Aziz, dubbed Mullah Burqa after he tried to escape in 2007 from Islamabad’s Red Mosque at a time that it was besieged by Pakistani military troops, has since been banned from giving sermons. Eight years after the siege in which 75 people died, Abdul Aziz has re-emerged as a seemingly untouchable figure, even if militant groups like Teheek-e-Taliban better known as the Pakistani Taliban that he supports have been significantly weakened in a military crackdown. Abdul Aziz illustrated the degree to which Saudi-backed ultra-conservatism inspired ideology had gained currency in Pakistani society.80

So did two events in early in 2016: mass demonstrations in February and March protesting the execution of Mumtaz Qadri, a jihadist who was an elite Force commando who was convicted to death for killing former Punjab governor Salman Taseer because of his opposition to Pakistan’s blasphemy laws,81 and for carrying out a suicide-bombing of a park in Lahore on Easter Sunday.82 As emergency units rushed to the park where 70 people had been killed and some 300, mostly women and children, wounded police in Islamabad sought to control a 10,000-strong demonstration against Qadri’s execution. Jammat-ul-Ahrar, an offshoot of the Pakistani Taliban said the bombing was aimed at Christians even if the vast majority of the victims were Muslims.

Taken together, the two events suggested that Pakistan’s problem went beyond political violence, to encompass a deep-seated, ultra-conservative and intolerant interpretation of Islam that has taken root in significant segments of society, and has created an environment in which oppression, discrimination and violence against the other is legitimised. The Economist noted that, “the religious hatred it (Jammat-ul-Ahrar) represents has been assiduously cultivated in Pakistan for many years. Saudi money for the building of madrassas (religious seminaries) began to flood into Pakistan during the 1980s with the encouragement of the president at that time, General Zia ul Haq, a Deobandi follower, who saw the country’s Islamisation as his main mission. There are now some 24,000 madrassas in Pakistan, attended by at least 2 million boys. Nearly all adhere to the highly conservative Deobandi sect, whose beliefs are similar to Saudi Wahhabism.” Some analysts put the number of madrassas closer to 30,000. They note that while a majority fall in the realm of the Deobandi, a substantial number subscribe to other interpretations of the faith.83

The magazine quoted Tahir Ashrafi, head of the Pakistan Ulema Council, as saying that 60% of the pupils at madrassas were “not involved in any training or terrorist activities.” In other words, 40 percent may be. “It’s a very complex feeder system. All the remaining 40% are not involved in terrorism or terrorist training, but they could be sympathisers, they could funnel part of their funds to terror outfits, they could aid and abet in various ways,” said Mahmoud, a Pakistani lawyer, businessman and author of a forthcoming book on Islam.84

In the book, Mahmoud recalls that “a bright young woman who worked with my aunt succeeded in penetrating a religious centre in the outskirts of Islamabad. The centre served as an orphanage and school for girls. It taught them a way of jihad. On occasion, young women, teenage girls, really, from the centre would be introduced to teenage boys from other centres. If a boy was to be sent on a suicide mission, he would be married to a girl, and the couple would be allowed to consummate their marriage. The experience was intended to provide the boy a foretaste of the pleasures that awaited him in heaven, the girl an assurance of a place in heaven as the wife of a martyr. If the boy did indeed complete his mission, the girl would be free to remarry. If the boy did not achieve martyrdom, the couple would be kept apart, in purgatory on this earth. Both boy and girl were provided strong incentives to push towards the event of suicide. The centre has been closed, but its cloistered, manipulative spirit endures.”85

The fallout of Deobandi philosophy – a “back to basics movement” in the words of British Deobandi Mufti Mohammed Amin Pando – goes far beyond the realm of South Asia, embedding itself deeply in Muslim minority communities in Europe. A 2016 BBC investigative documentary traced jihadist thinking to a month-long visit to Britain in 1993 by Masood Azhar, a graduate of a Deobandi madrassa called Darul Uloom Islamia Binori Town in Karachi, who headed the Pakistani militant group Harakat ul Mujahedeen. Azhar, a portly bespectacled preacher, son of a Bahawalpur religious studies teacher and author of a four-volume treatise on jihad as well as books with titles like Forty Diseases of the Jews,86 gave 40 lectures during his fundraising and recruitment tour in Britain, and was feted by Islamic scholars from Britain’s largest mosque network. More and more scholars joined his entourage as he toured the country before moving on to Saudi Arabia. His tour included Darul Uloom Bury (Bury House of Knowledge), a boarding school and seminary that was home to Sheikh Yusuf Motala, Britain’s foremost Islamic scholar.87 A passionate and emotive speaker, women reportedly took off their jewellery and handed it to Azhar after listening to his speeches.88

Deobandis, the Muslim sect with the greatest reach in the U.K., control an estimated 40 percent of all British mosques that service an estimated 600,000 people. A substantial number of UK-trained Muslim scholars are graduates of Deobandi institutions. Deobandis trace their roots to a seminary established in 1866, in the Indian town of Deoband in the state of Uttar Pradesh, that was founded in the struggle against British colonialism. The seminary is widely viewed as one of the foremost institutions of Islamic learning, although it consists of a host of departments that focus on the rejection of Christianity, Judaism, Shia Islam, Barelvism and a postgraduate course that teaches loathing of Ahmadis89 a sect is widely viewed by conservative Muslims as heretic, because it recognizes Mirza Ghulam Ahmad as the messiah prophesied by Mohammed. .90 “The theology of the Deoband school…fosters social change and nurtures the ideals of political activism,” noted Islam scholar Ebrahim Moosa. Its adherents run the gamut from political quietists to moderate-minded social activists to militant Islamists like the Taliban.91

With Pakistan becoming a battleground in the proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran in the wake of the 1979 Islamic revolution, Deobandis, funded by Saudi Arabia, launched an anti-Shia campaign. The fiery Deobandi cleric Haq Nawaz Jhangvi, a madrassa graduate who became head of the Jamiat- i-Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), a Deobandi party, is reported to have maintained close ties to Pakistani intelligence92 until he was killed in 1990 by Shiite militants. Jhangvi, who earned his spores with his agitation against the Ahmadis, 93 founded Anjuman Sipah-e-Sahaba (Soldiers of the Prophet’s Companions) with the sole purpose of combating Shiites. With Pakistani Shiites feeling empowered and emboldened by the Iranian revolution, Saudi Arabia was more than willing to generously fund the anti-Shiite campaign.94 As mentioned earlier, Saudi funds were largely routed through the Pakistani military and the ISI.95 The Muslim World League also funded the prominent Indian Deobandi scholar, Muḥammad Manzo̤ or Naumani, who compiled a book of anti-Shiite fatwas that included opinions of Pakistani scholars and was distributed in Pakistan.96

Marouf Dualibi, an Islamic scholar with close ties to Saudi King Fahd was dispatched by the kingdom to help General Zia introduce hudood, the Islamic legal concept of punishment as well as mandatory zakat, a charitable tax, and ushr, an agricultural levy that dates back to early Islam, as well as persuade the Pakistani leader to adopt anti-Shia laws.97 A 1981 report by the Council of Islamic Ideology — an advisory body of clerics and scholars established to assist the Pakistani government in bringing laws in line with the Quran and the example of the Prophet Mohammed – reported that hudood laws were discussed by the Council and the Law Ministry “under the guidance of Dr. Maruf Dualibi, who was specially detailed by the government of Saudi Arabia for this purpose.”98

Pakistani security consultant Muhammad Amir Rana reported that Saudi Arabia in the first decade of the 21st century had donated US $2.7 million to the education department of the municipality of Jhang in Punjab, Jhangvi’s hometown, for the funding of madrassas.99 The Saudi campaign aimed at pressuring the Pakistani government to designate the Shiites as non-Muslims and make Sunni Islam the basis for an Islamic state. This also served to boost the fortunes of the Deobandis, who until then had been a minor presence, at the expense of other Muslim groups, particularly the Sufis.100 “The Saudis injected conservative attitudes into Muslim societies. They infiltrated Muslim societies. It created many divisions and a sectarian culture. It has impacted Pakistan’s social fabric,” Rana said in an interview.101

Sipah-e-Sahab’s membership swelled to a million, including some 5,000 well-trained militants who waged a campaign of terror against Shiites. The group was backed by a fatwa issued by the Deobandi scholar Naumani, that declared Shiites to be non-believers and was endorsed by hundreds of scholars in India and Pakistan. Maulana Wali Hassan, the Deobandi grand mufti of Pakistan, banned Sunni Muslims from marrying Shiites, participating in Shiite funeral rites, burying Shiites in Muslim graveyards and eating meat from animals slaughtered by Shiites even in accordance with Islamic law.102

Saudi Arabia at the same time backed Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the internationally designated terrorist who founded Lashkar-e-Taibe, one of the largest and most of violent militant Islamist groups in South Asia, because of his longstanding ties to the kingdom and his strong links to the Ahl- e-Hadith103 group that had maintained close bonds with ultra-conservatives like the Wahhabis and Salafis since its founding in the 1920s.104 Saeed, a graduate of an Ahl-e-Hadith madrassa and the King Saud University in Riyadh, backed by Saudi money, founded Islamic schools in which potential jihadis not only studied Islam, but also acquired the computer and communication skills they would need in their militant Islamist career.105

Much of the British Deobandi community has in the wake of 9/11 sought to distance itself from the minority of primarily Pakistani scholars and madrassas that opt for an endorsement of violent jihad. Motala, , in an Urdu-language note to the BBC said that “during the last several decades, I have neither uttered Masood Azhar’s name in my speeches, even by mistake, nor mentioned his group, nor talked about any nihilistic terrorist action.”106 The UK’s Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted), however, concluded on the basis of an unannounced visit to Darul Uloom Bury in January 2016, that its students had a deep understanding of “fundamental British values, such as democracy, rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance for those of different faiths.”107

Yet, the Muslim Council of Britain, widely viewed as the UK’s foremost Muslim umbrella group, in line with Deobandi, Wahhabi and Salafi thinking, declared in April 2016 a position against Ahmadis who are also on the defensive in various countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Britain.108 In a statement that paid only lip service to “to pluralism and peaceful coexistence and…the rights of all to believe as they choose without coercion, fear and intimidation,” the Council, in response to requests by unidentified parties for it to take a stand on the persecuted group, stated that “Muslims should not be forced to class Ahmadis as Muslims if they do not wish to do so, at the same time, we call on Muslims to be sensitive, and above all, respect all people irrespective of belief or background.”109 The BBC documentary further linked Scotland’s largest mosque, the Glasgow Central Mosque, 23 years later to Sipah-e-Sahaba that has been banned in Britain because of its deadly attacks against Shiites and other minorities in Pakistan.110

Responding to the MCB statement in The Independent, Waqar Ahmedi, a British Ahmadi, warned that “when Muslims start playing God in this way, religious prejudice, bigotry and hate will inevitably rise – including here in Britain…. They appear content to regard extremists like the murderer of Asad Shah and hate preachers as among their co-religionists, but not those who live by the motto ‘love for all, hatred for none.’ Whatever the theological differences, no individual or institution has any authority to dictate what anyone else can and cannot call themselves. My faith is a matter between me and my Maker. Freedom of belief and the right to self-determination are among the cornerstones of any progressive society. The Prophet Muhammad certainly stood up for those rights — one hopes bodies like the Muslim Council of Britain does too,” Ahmedi wrote. Asad Shah was a popular news vendor in Glasgow who was murdered a month before the MCB statement because of his faith.111

The MCB statement seemed to belie the longstanding rejection of the notion by Britain’s Islamic scholars that Muslim radicalism emanated from the country’s South Asian mosques. The MCB scholars identify Arab Islamists like Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, better known as Abu Hamza al-Masri, a fiery Egyptian cleric, (who preached at London’s Finsbury Park Mosque in London before being extradited to the United States where he was sentenced to life in prison on terrorism charges, and Omar Bakri Muhammad, a Syrian-born Salafist, as the guilty parties.

“These Wahhabi preachers, who operated on the fringes of Muslim communities, certainly played an important role in radicalising elements of Britain’s Muslim youth. But it was Azhar, a Pakistani [Deobandi] cleric, who was the first to spread the seeds of modern jihadist militancy in Britain – and it was through South Asian mosques belonging to the Deobandi movement that he did it,” Bowen said.112

In his lectures during his visit to Britain, Azhar argued that much of the Quran was dedicated to “killing for the sake of Allah”, while a substantial number of the Prophet Mohammed’s sayings dealt with jihad. At the inauguration of a mosque in Plaistow, Azhar dwelled on “the divine promise of victory to those engaged in jihad.” In another public presentation, Azhar argued that “the youth should prepare for jihad without any delay. They should get jihadist training from wherever they can.” His slogan was “from jihad to Jannat (paradise).”113

Birmingham-born Mohammed Bilal, a student in the West Midlands, who left Britain in 1994 to join Azhar’s newly founded Jaish-e-Mohammed (Army of Mohammed), was one of the first Azhar recruited on his UK tour. He died in 2000 as a suicide bomber when he attacked an Indian Army barracks in Srinagar, killing nine people.114 Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, a student from London, was another. Sheikh gained notoriety as one of the hijackers of an Indian Airlines flight, who demanded Azhar’s release from prison as well of one of the 2002 kidnappers who snatched Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl and beheaded him.115 Rashid Raul, an in-law of Azhar’s, who like Bilal hailed from Birmingham, is widely believed to have been one of the masterminds of the 7/7 attacks in 2005 on London’s public transport system, as well as a failed attempt to again assault the system two weeks later on July 21 and efforts to smuggle liquid bomb-making substances aboard trans-Atlantic flights.116 Waheed Ali, a young Bangladeshi friend of the 7/7 bomber Shehzad Tanweer, reported that he listened to tapes of Azhar’s speeches.117

Jaish-e-Mohammed maintains a semi-legal, public presence in Pakistan itself, despite government assertions that it is cracking down on jihadist groups. A Wall Street Journal reporter on a recent visit to Lahore, a city of 600,000 that is home to the headquarters of the Pakistan Army’s XXXI Corps, visited the group’s four-storey, downtown compound that also houses an affiliated seminary.

Although the group has had several of its seminaries closed down, it is building an even bigger facility on four hectares of land on the edge of Lahore with a new madrassa, crowned with white domes, looming over the surrounding farmland. “We don’t hide who we are. We are a jihadist group,” a cleric affiliated with Jaish-e-Mohammed told the visiting reporter.118 A sign outside another Jaish complex in the Usman-o-Ali madrassa in the central Pakistani city of Bahawalpur says its seminary is “under the guidance” of Azhar.119

Jaish-e-Mohammed’s overt operations despite being proscribed reflect the degree to which the Pakistani military, intelligence and interior ministry has embraced Saudi-backed sectarianism and ultra-conservatism.

“There is a sense of weary resignation hung around the shoulders of reports that the government is struggling, and largely failing, to keep on top of the problem of banned organisations that continue to resurface, remake and relaunch themselves under a new set of acronyms. Many of these groups are decades-old, at least in their original iteration, and almost equally many are either openly sectarian in nature or simply dedicated to the downfall of the democratic state. It is the interior ministry that is ultimately responsible for this sorry state of affairs, and the buck ought to stop at the desk of the interior minister himself — an outcome as likely as rivers ever flowing uphill…. Let us not deceive ourselves — there is no shortage of people in the populace that do support such groups, be it with money or logistical support, and allow them a broad footprint nationwide… Millions are inclined to give succour to these snakes that we keep at the bottom of the garden and which all too often turn and bite us,” commented The Express Tribune.120

Pakistani indulgence of Saudi-backed militant groups impacts Muslim communities far beyond the South Asian nation’s border. In the UK, prominent UK-based Deobandi scholar Khalid Mehmood has frequently been associated with Aalmi Majlis Tahaffuz Khatm-e-Nubuwwat (AMTKN), a militant Pakistan-based group that is also legally registered with the UK Charity Commission. AMTKN, with a history of Saudi backing in its various guises since it first was established in 1953, campaigns against Ahmadis, an Islamic sect widely viewed by conservative Muslims as heretics that is on the defensive in various countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Britain alongside Pakistan. As far back as the then, Saudi Arabia intervened to prevent the execution of AMTKN scholars, including Abul Ala Maududi, one of the 20th centuries for most Muslim thinkers, who were sentenced to death for sparking anti-Ahmadi riots in Lahore that led to the imposition of martial law in the city. The clerics were released a year later on a legal technicality.

Back in the UK, prominent UK-based Deobandi scholar Khalid Mehmood has frequently been associated with Aalmi Majlis Tahaffuz Khatm-e-Nubuwwat (AMTKN), a militant Pakistan-based group that is also legally registered with the UK Charity Commission. AMTKN campaigns against Ahmadis. The AMTKN website describes Ahmadis as wajib-al-qati or deserving to die.121 However, the group defines itself on its website as “an international, religious, preaching and reform organisation of Islamic Millat, (a global Islamic nationality irrespective of geographical boundaries. It says that its sole aim has been and is to unite all the Muslims of the world to safeguard the sanctity of Prophethood and the finality of Prophethood and to refute the repudiators of the belief in the finality of Prophet hood of the Holy Prophet Hazrat Muhammad.”122 It has 50 and operates 12 madrassas, mostly in Pakistan, but says it has operations abroad, listing only Mali by name on its website.

The AMTKN group, whose name translates as the Global Congress for the Preservation of the Finality of Prophethood, traces its root to Saudi Arabia’s decision in the late 1970s to deny Ahmadis visas for the pilgrimage to Mecca and call for their excommunication. The Kingdom, leveraging its financial support for Pakistan, including funding of its clandestine nuclear weapons program, got Bhutto to introduce constitutional provisions that obliged the country’s presidents and prime ministers to swear an oath that they believed in the finality of Mohammed’s prophecy and denied the possibility of any prophet after him – provisions designed to move Ahmadis beyond the pale.

Saudi King Faisal advised Bhutto on the sideline of the 1974 Islamic Summit Conference in Islamabad that Saudi aid would be contingent on Pakistan declaring Ahmadis non-Muslims.123 The Muslim World League called two months later on all Muslim governments to excommunicate Ahmadis and bar them from holding sensitive government positions. The Saudis effectively forced Bhutto to reverse his awarding of senior posts to Ahmadis after they supported him in a narrowly won election in 1970. Bhutto’s Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs was an Ahmadi, as were the official overseeing Pakistan’s nuclear program and the commanders of the navy and the air force. Ahmadis were also among the Army’s corps commanders. The Saudi campaign was crowned when Pakistan’s national assembly amended the constitution in 1974 to designate Ahmadis as a minority. Saudi rejection over the years has been supported by the Deobandis.124 .125 Ahmadis have since been banned from calling their houses of worship mosques and greeting one another with the customary words, As-salamu alaikum, Peace be upon you. Pakistani passport applications require Muslims to distance to forswear the founder of the Ahmadi community.

The immediate impact in Pakistan of the campaign was the killing of Ahmadis, burning of their properties and the desecration of their mosques and cemeteries. Little has since changed. In 2011, a AMTKN leaflet in Urdu calling for the murder of Ahmadis that circulated in Pakistan identified a south London mosque, the Stockwell Mosque, as its overseas contact point.126 The mosque at the time denied any association with either the leaflet or AMTKN, even though it is listed as an AMTKN office with the Charity Commission. Four of the mosque’s managers serve as AMTKN trustees. Piles of leaflets in English demanding death for Ahmadis were found by a BBC researcher in the mosque in April 2016.127

Three months later, the group again listed the London mosque as its international address alongside the contact details of its offices in Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Quetta, and Multan in newspaper advertisements across Pakistan calling during Ramadan for donations to restrict Ahmadi activity; “save Muslims from them;” file lawsuits against them; establish mosques and seminaries in Chenab Nagar, home to the Ahmadi’s main organization, Jamaat-e-Ahmadia; and print anti-Ahmadi literature.128 The ad appeared three weeks after unidentified gunman killed an Ahmadi outside his home in Karachi.129

The ad appeared on the back of years of deadly attacks on the Ahmadis and repeated manifestations of tacit government approval. Two gunmen sprayed an Ahmadi mosque in Lahore in 2010 with bullets. At the same time, two others lobbed grenades and exploded suicide vests in another mosques 15 kilometres away. 95 people were killed and 120 others injured. Days later, gunmen attacked the hospital were the wounded were being treated. “This is a final warning to the (Ahmadi community) to leave Pakistan or prepare for death at the hands of the Prophet Muhammad’s devotees,” the group said in a statement.130

At the time, Punjab’s law minister, Rana Sanaullah, a member of Nawaz Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League, campaigned openly alongside leaders of Sipah-e-Sahaba in an election during a special election in Jhang. Members of Sipah, flouting restrictions placed on the outlawed group, paraded through the town wielding weapons and chanting bloodcurdling anti-Ahmadi and anti-Shi’ite slogans. Rather than halting the march, police escorted it.131

Four years later, on the eve Eid-al-Fitr, which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan, a frenzied mob in the city of Gujranwala set Ahmadi homes and businesses ablaze in retaliation for an allegedly blasphemous Facebook post by a young Ahmadi man. While the mob danced and police stood idly by, a fifty-five year-old Ahmadi woman and her two young granddaughters suffocated to death as a result of the smoke. The girls’ pregnant aunt miscarried during the ensuing chaos.132

Taxi driver Tanveer Ahmed took AMTKN’s advice literally when he killed Asad Shah, an Ahmadi shopkeeper in Glasgow, in March 2016. An AMTKN-linked Facebook page congratulated all Muslims on Shah’s death.133 Ultra-conservative and Deobandi prejudice against Ahmadis is weaving itself into the fibre of British society, with Sunnis in Muslim neighbourhoods refusing to greet the minority with the traditional welcome, salaam aleikum ‘peace be upon you, share a meal with them or do business with them.134 Ahmadi butchers who sell halal meat in Britain have seen their business substantially reduced after imams called on their flock to boycott Ahmadi shops.135 Death threats have persuaded the Beitul Futuh Mosque in London and Ahamdi mosques elsewhere in Britain, frequented by the country’s 30,000 followers of the sect, to introduce airport-style security checks at mosques.136

Security measures at Ahmadi mosques and mainstream Muslim rejection of the Ahmadis, along with the anti-Muslim sentiment in Europe, contrast starkly with the role the Ahmadis played on the continent a century ago in forging bridges between Muslims and non-Muslims in Europe. Founded in 1923 as part of the first wave of Muslim emigration to Europe, the Ahmadi mosque was centre of intellectual discussion on issues as divergent as balancing modern daily life with the requirements of Islamic doctrine and the future of Germany and Europe in the wake of World War One. German non- Muslims, disappointed by Christian civilization, sought answers in those discussions and many ultimately converted to Islam.137 One of the mosque’s directors, Hugo Marcus, was a gay Jewish philosopher who converted to Islam.138 Built by a Jewish scholar, Gottlieb Leitner, the Shah Jahan Mosque in Woking, a town 45 kilometres south of London, played a similar role at the time.139

A Poor Return on Investment

Violence in Pakistan in which an estimated 60,000 people have been killed in the last decades, as well as the thousands of deaths in numerous other parts of the world, is likely not what Saudi Arabia hoped to achieve through its campaign to further ultra-conservatism.

A more conservative, intolerant society in which Saudi Arabia held the foremost status as the leader of the Muslim world was. Pakistan is paying the price in terms of lives, Saudi Arabia in terms of reputational damage. The events of March 2016 are the latest to raise questions about the effectiveness of Saudi Arabia’s more than US $100 billion, four-decade long campaign in building the kingdom’s soft power. So do Saudi efforts to harness the kingdom’s diplomatic and military relationships in support of its more assertive foreign and military policies Saudi Arabia came up short in its effort to rally support in early 2016 for its conflict in Iran, following Saudi Arabia’s execution of Shiite cleric Nimr al Nimr, the storming of the Saudi embassy in Tehran and the breaking off of Saudi diplomatic relations with Iran. Only a handful of countries – Bahrain, Sudan, Somalia, Djibouti, and the Maldives – followed Riyadh’s example and ruptured their ties with Iran, as a result of Saudi check book diplomacy. Major players like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Malaysia despite close diplomatic, intelligence and non-governmental ties to the kingdom, rejected the Saudi request, choosing instead to walk a tightrope between Riyadh and Tehran.

The stakes for Pakistan were higher than other Muslim nations not only because of its shared border with Iran, but because of the changing geopolitical dynamics that have come with lifting of Iran’s sanctions. It revived the construction of an Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline as well as Iranian, Afghan and Indian interest in development of the Iranian port of Chabahar. Besides competing with the Chinese-funded Pakistani port of Gwadar, Chabahar would allow Afghanistan to break Pakistan’s regional maritime monopoly and offer India access to energy-rich Central Asia.

Saudi Arabia’s seemingly poor soft power return on investment is not simply that Muslim states largely want to keep their lines open to two of the Middle East’s foremost power. It also is the result of domestic repercussions that governments across the Muslim world fear. Saudi Arabia was taken aback when Pakistan despite massive Saudi financial support for its economy, madrassas, and nuclear program and the kingdom’s assistance in getting Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif out of prison following General Pervez Musharraf’s 1999 coup and hosting him for his seven years in exile; rejected a Saudi request that it support military intervention in Yemen.

Saudia Arabia’s seemingly poor soft power return on investment is not simply that Muslim states largely want to keep their lines open to two of the Middle East’s foremost powers, but also the result of domestic repercussions that governments across the Muslim world fear. Saudi Arabia was taken aback when Pakistan rejected a Saudi request to support its military intervention in Yemen, despite massive Saudi financial support for Pakistan’s economy, madrassas, and nuclear program, as well as, the kingdom’s assistance in getting Nawaz Sharif out of prison following General Musharraf’s 1999 coup and hosting him for his seven years in exile, using Lebanese politician Saad Hariri as an intermediary, Saudi Arabia warned Musharraf that continued good relations depended on the release of Sharif and his family.140

Saudi Arabia had assumed that it had sufficient Pakistani chits to cash in. The kingdom is home to over two million Pakistani expatriates,141 and is Pakistan’s single largest source of remittances.142 Saudi Arabia has come to Pakistan’s aid in times of difficulty, for example, by providing oil on deferred payment when Islamabad was hit by U.S. sanctions after conducting nuclear tests in 1998. In addition, some 1,200 Pakistani troops are stationed in the kingdom.143 Pakistani military foundations recruited retired military personnel to serve as mercenaries in Bahrain during the Saudi- backed crushing of a popular revolt in Bahrain in 2011.144

Yet, with Shiites constituting up to 20 percent of the population in Pakistan and escalating sectarian tensions in recent years, as well as plans for closer economic and energy cooperation with Iran, Pakistan has little choice but to walk a tightrope. Just how tight the tightrope is, was evident in guidelines for coverage of the Saudi-Iranian dispute issued by Pakistan’s electronic media regulatory authority. “Media houses should ideally refrain from airing programs that can result in irreparable damage,” the guidelines said.145

Lack of Oversight

Wahhabism’s proselytising character served the Al Saud’s purpose as they first sought to stymie Arab nationalism’s appeal in the 1950s and 1960s, and later that of Iran’s Islamic revolution. These were tectonic developments that promised to redraw the political map of the Middle East and North Africa in ways that potentially threatened Saudi Arabia’s rulers. Both developments were revolutionary and involved the toppling of Western-backed monarchs. Arab nationalism was secular and socialist in nature. The Islamic revolution in Iran was the first toppling of a US icon in the region and a moreover involved a monarch. The Islamic republic represented a form of revolutionary Islam that recognised a degree of popular sovereignty. Each in their own way, posed a threat to the Al Sauds who cloaked their legitimacy in a religious puritanism that demanded on theological grounds absolute obedience to the ruler.

Ultimately, the Saudi campaign benefited from Arab socialism’s failure to deliver jobs, public goods and services, as well as the death knell to notions of Arab unity delivered by Israel’s overwhelming victory in the Middle East in the 1967 in which the Jewish state conquered East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and the Sinai Peninsula. Moreover, Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser’s early rupture with the non-Salafist Muslim Brotherhood, led many Brothers to join the stream of migrant workers that headed for the Gulf. They brought their activism with them and took up positions in education that few Saudis were able to fill. They also helped create and staff organisations like the Muslim World League, initially founded to counter Nasser’s Pan-Arab appeal.146 The campaign further exploited opportunities created by Nasser’s successor, Anwar al- Sadat, who defined himself as “the believing president.”147 Sadat in contrast to Nasser allowed Muslim groups like the Brotherhood and Salafis to re-emerge and create social organisations, build mosques and found universities.148

The rise of the Brotherhood in the kingdom sparked a fusion of the group’s political thinking with segments of the Wahhabi and Salafi community, but also accentuated stark differences between the two. Saudi establishment clergy as well as militants took the Brotherhood to task for its willingness to accept the state and operate within the framework of its constrictions. They also accused it of creating fitna or division among Muslims by endorsing the formation of political groups and parties and demanding loyalty to the group rather than to God, Muslims and Islam.149

The Saudi campaign was bolstered by the creation of various institutions including not only the Muslim World League and its multiple subsidiaries, but also Al Haramain, another charity, and the likes of the Islamic University of Medina. In virtually all of these instances, the Saudis were the funders. The executors were others often with agendas of their own such as the Brotherhood or in the case of Al Haramain, more militant Islamists, if not jihadists. Saudi oversight was non-existent and the laissez-faire attitude started at the top.

The lack of oversight was evident in the National Commercial Bank (NCB) when it was Saudi Arabia’s largest financial institution. NCB had a department of numbered accounts. These were all accounts belonging to members of the ruling family. Only three people had access to those accounts, one of them was the majority owner of the bank, Khaled Bin Mahfouz.150 Bin Mahfouz would get a phone call from a senior member of the family who would instruct him to transfer money to a specific country, leaving it up to Bin Mahfouz where precisely that money would go.

In one instance, Bin Mahfouz was instructed by Prince Sultan, the then Defence Minister, to wire US $5 million to Bosnia Herzegovina. Sultan did not indicate the beneficiary. Bin Mahfouz sent the money to a charity in Bosnia, that in the wake of 9/11 was raided by US law enforcement and Bosnian security agents.151 The hard disks of the foundation revealed the degree to which the institution was controlled by jihadists.152 In one instance, the Saudis suspected one of the foundation’s operatives of being a member of Egypt’s Islamic Jihad. They sent someone to Sarajevo to investigate. The investigator confronted the man saying: “We hear that you have these connections and if that is true we need to part ways.” The man put his hand on his heart and denied the allegation. As far as the Saudis were concerned the issue was settled until the man later in court testimony described how easy it was to fool the Saudis.

An ambiguous attitude

One place where refusal to acknowledge Saudi Arabia as the gold standard of an Islamic State is counter balanced by the belief of the quietist trend in Saudi-backed Islamic ultra-conservatism is a two storey, walled building built around a courtyard in an upscale neighbourhood of Islamabad. The building houses the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), Pakistan’s top Islamic advisory body designed to guide parliament on whether proposed bills comply with the Sharia’a. The Council’s offices hark back a quarter of century to a time when computers with small monitors were far and few between; fax machines dominated; and desks were piled with papers, folders and press clippings and dotted with a battery of telephones.

Two of the council‘s members, in a rare public brawl in a government agency over religion, got into a fist fight in 2015 as the council debated further discrimination against Ahmadis. The council was considering categorizing Ahmadis as apostates, a crime punishable by death under strict Islamic law.

“I am stronger than him… He wants to make the law on Ahmadis controversial, and push the country towards violence,” Maulana Tahir Ashrafi, a controversial, pot-bellied, alcohol-consuming scholar and head of the Pakistan Ulema Council charged after 78-year-old Maulana Mohammad Khan Sherani, the CII chairman and a member of parliament for the Deobandi-affiliated Jamiat Ulema-e- Islam (Fazal) party who adheres to Saudi-backed quietist Salafi principle of unquestioned obedience to a ruler, grabbed his collar and ripped out the buttons.153

Sporting a square white beard and clad in a black turban and vest and white salwar kameez, Sherani cuts a stern figure with his Central Asian features and narrow eyes. He embodies Saudi Arabia’s dilemma: those that it has nurtured and that are closest to the kingdom’s ideology increasingly view it as a country that has betrayed its funding beliefs. “Both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are Islamic states that do not follow what Islam teaches… Allah did not ordain monarchies,” Sherani asserted in an interview.154

In remarks that deliberately included Saudi Arabia by implication, Sherani described Pakistan as “a security state” in which “those that are in power do what is in their interests… Religious leaders participate in elections to bring rulers closer to the truth. It’s their prerogative not to follow. Those in power play games and have many puppets. The ulema’s responsibility is to keep informing the public and government,” Sherani said.

In a twist of irony, Sherani spoke sitting in his spacious office under a picture of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the lawyer and politician who founded Pakistan as a secular republic. The irony and difficulty quietist ultra-conservatives have in justifying their support for governments they essentially view as illegitimate was evident in Sherani’s effort to explain his support of the Pakistani government and endorsement of the Al Sauds’ rule. “You obey the rules and do not risk fitna in the community,” he said.

Sherani tied himself into knots as he sought to justify his position. Comparing the government to a blind man standing at the edge of a well, Sherani argued that it was his responsibility to warn the man but not stop him. “It is his responsibility if he does not listen,” Sherani said. When asked if his refusal to stop the man would not make him an accomplice if he fell into the well and hurt or killed himself, Sherani quickly changed tack. In the only time that he smiled during a three-hour interview, he said a better example was a man on a street who asked for directions but then opted not to follow them. That is not my responsibility,” he said.

In a magazine interview after his brawl with Sherani, Ashrafi, referring to the CIIl’s Saudi-backed ultra-conservatism asserted that “there is a dictatorship within the body. The environment is such that no scope for dissent is left.”155 Shortly after the brawl, the council suggested in apparent support of the fact that wife beating in Pakistan is the norm rather than the exception156 that a draft bill in parliament legalize the right of husbands to ‘lightly’ beat wives who refuse to obey their orders or have sex with them. The council had earlier urged parliament to declare nine year-old girls eligible for marriage and replace the Pakistani rupee with gold and silver. The council further denounced a women’s protection bill passed by the Punjab provincial assembly as a violation of the tenants of the Sharia.157

Members of parliament blamed the CII days after its ruling on wife beating for the brutal killing of 18-year old Zeenat Rafiq. Rafiq, one of an increasing number of women killed for asserting their independence, was burnt alive by her mother after she married a man of her own choice. “I have killed my daughter. I have saved my honour. She will never shame me again,” neighbours heard Rafiq’s mother, who had complained for months that her two elder daughters had married men of their choice, shout from the roof her house when she was done.158

Rafiq was but one of an average of 1,000 of mostly female victims of honour killings in Pakistan. A Jirga or council of local elders in the city of Abbottabad where Osama Bin Laden was killed by US forces ordered the killing of a teenage girl that had helped a friend elope. The Jirga dictated the manner of her death. The girl was tortured, injected with poison and then strapped to the seat of a vehicle that was parked at a bus stop as a message to others, doused with gasoline and set on fire.

In parliament, deputies charged that the council had legitimized violence against women and questioned whether it should be allowed to continue to exist. Opposition deputies Aitzaz Ahsan and Farhatullah Babar asserted that “the anti-women bias of the CII as expressed in its recommendations and pronouncements” had “contributed to crimes against women with impunity.”159 So does the breeding of ultra-conservatism among women in the exponential growth of all-female madrassahs. Columnist I. A. Rehman picked up on that when he suggested that a section of society, including women, has been influenced by ultra-conservative opposition to women’s rights to the extent of justifying violence against all those who rebel against unjust constraints.”160

The council has also condemned co-education, demanded that state-owned Pakistan International Airlines hostesses be fully covered, and called for the dismissal of civil servants who failed to say their daily prayers. It declared in 2014 that a man did not need his wife’s consent to marry a second, third or fourth wife and that DNA of a rape victim did not constitute conclusive evidence.

To be fair, parliament has in recent years not acted on any of the council’s positions. Nonetheless, the council forced Marvi Memon, a law maker for the ruling Muslim League, in early 2016 to withdraw a proposal to ban child marriages, declaring the draft bill un-Islamic and blasphemous.161

The history of the council, ironically housed on Islamabad’s leafy Ataturk Avenue, named after the visionary who created modern Turkey as a secular state, charts the increasing influence of Saudi conservatism in Pakistan. Founded in 1962, the council was originally headed by Fazlur Rahman Malik, a liberal scholar, who in the words of Pakistani journalist Farahnaz Ispahani put forward “bold and ingenious interpretation of Islamic themes, including suggesting that drinking of alcohol was permissible, provided it did not result in intoxication.”162

Rahman, who returned to Pakistan from Canada at the invitation of President Ayub Khan to head the council’s predecessor, the Central Institute of Islamic Research, resigned in 1968 frustrated with the success of conservative opposition to his ideas. The council’s conservative instinct was boosted in the late 1970s and the 1980s by Zia ul Haq who needed it to legitimize his effort to Islamicize Pakistani society. It was under Ul Haq that Pakistan enacted hudood, Islamic law’s concept of punishment that involves amputations, whipping and death sentences for crimes such as theft, pre-marital sex, and rape, and that ultra-conservatives interpret as a license to put rape victims at risk of prosecution if he or she cannot produce four upright male eye-witnesses.

In an unprecedented parliamentary debate in 2015 about the council’s role, opposition deputy Pakistan People’s Party’s Farhatullah Babar called for its dissolution because it was “dangerously conservative” and irrelevant. “I am pained that some of the council’s pronouncements have prompted the critics to describe it as something of medieval nonsense at public expense,” said Babar. He cited a long list of “long and frustrating” council proposals that included inscribing the words Allah-o-Akbar (God is Great) on Pakistan’s national flag and charged that the council inspired martyrdom and jihad. Islamist deputies denounced Babar and demanded that he recite verses of the Quran to prove his religiosity.163

The positions adopted by the council were with the exception of the transgenders in line with Saudi policy. Saudi influence was also evident in Pakistan’s feeble attempts to gain some measure of control of the madrassahs that mostly involve boarding schools. Registration with the Pakistan Madrassa Education Board (PMEB), the government’s overall board, established in 2003 to oversee boards that represent the country’s five Muslim schools of thought, and encourage madrassahs to use government syllabi and offer vocational training is voluntary rather than mandatory. Oversight of the five sectarian boards by the education and religious affairs ministries, bulwarks of ultra- conservatism, has proven to be spotty at best.

As a result, the PMEB’s efforts have been largely rejected by the more conservative and militant institutions, many of which have had Saudi financial backing. PMEB chairman Amir Tauseen, estimated 13 years after the board’s establishment that up to 10,000 religious seminaries were not registered. A renewed effort in in 2015 to get madrassas to register, involving newspaper advertisements, failed to convey sincerity by aiming to get a mere 500 institutions to register.164

Traditional culture on the defensive

Gunmen on a motorbike shot dead one of Pakistan’s best known Sufi musicians and scion of a musical dynasty, Amjad Sabri, in June 2016 as he drove his car in the port city of Karachi. Fakhre Alam, the Chairman of the Sindh Board of Film Censors, claimed on Twitter that security authorities had earlier rejected a request by Sabri for protection. The Islamabad High Court (IHC) in 2014 demanded an explanation in a blasphemy case from Sabri and two TV channels who were accused of playing and broadcasting a qawwali, a form of Sufi devotional music, that was deemed offensive because it referred to the Prophet Mohammed.165

The killing claimed by the Pakistani Taliban was the latest in a campaign waged by jihadists as well as non-violent Saudi-backed ultra-conservative interpreters of Islam that has in recent decades stifled popular culture; silenced music; led to the bombing of theatres and video and music shops; and provoked the death of scores of musicians and other artists. Sabri was a target both as a musician and a Sufi, whose shrines have repeatedly been attacked in recent years. His assassination served as a warning to those determined to celebrate and preserve indigenous cultural traditions. Human rights activist Ali Dayan Hasan warned that each killing brought Pakistan closer to being what he termed a Wahhabi-Salafist wasteland.

It is a wasteland that Saadat Hasan Manto, a Muslim journalist, Indian film screenwriter and South Asia’s foremost short story writer envisioned as early as 1954 in an essay, ‘By the Grace of Allah.’ Manto described a Pakistan in which everything – music and art, literature and poetry – was censored. “There were clubs where people gambled and drank. There were dance houses, cinema houses, art galleries and God knows what other places full of sin … But now by the grace of God, gentlemen, one neither sees a poet or a musician… Thank God we are now rid of these satanic people. The people had been led astray. They were demanding their undue rights. Under the aegis of an atheist flag they wanted to topple the government. By the grace of God, not a single one of those people is amongst us today. Thank goodness a million times that we are ruled by mullahs and we present sweets to them every Thursday…. By the grace of God, our world is now cleansed of this chaos. People eat, pray and sleep,” Manto wrote.166

Maulana Amir Siddiqui, the leading imam at Islamabad’s notorious Red Mosque, one of the Pakistani capital’s oldest mosques named after its red walls and interior, is just the sort of mullah Manto had in mind. “Music is a great weapon of Satan used to spread obscenity in society. As music spreads, people will get only further away from the Qur’an,” Siddiqui argued in a sermon in 2015. In an interview, he added that “if there is something that draws a person closer to sin like music does, it is forbidden. All music these days is based on temptation, emotions, and illicit relations between men and women, which can lead to sex and sin.”167

Seven years prior to Siddique’s sermon, students at the mosque’s madrassah launched an anti-vice campaign and marched through Islamabad. They attacked and beat those they accused of running brothels and torched video and music shops. More than a 100 people were killed in fighting between the students and security forces.

Authorities found stockpiles of weapons in the Red Mosque’s compound.

Karachi’s Metropol Hotel, once Pakistan’s prime music venue that hosted the likes of Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington and Quincey Jones, stands today and shuttered and in decay. “The biggest names in the industry, people we grew up listening to, have just completely given up. It’s very disheartening, people walking away, people you think are so successful, gods, the stars and the icons. It’s like Freddy Mercury just decided to open up a restaurant instead of being on stage.” said Sara Haider, a 24-year old rising star who records in her own studio because Pakistani music labels refuse to sign new artists.168

Sabeen Mahmud, a prominent Pakistani social and human rights activist who operated The Second Floor, one of Karachi’s few remaining retreats for artists, gave Sara her first break. The 40-year old was gunned down in April 2015.

Gulzur Alam, one of Pakistan’s most popular folk singers with a fan base that stretches into Afghanistan and across the Pashtu Diaspora, hasn’t performed for years.

“Pashtun Youth, raise the red flags of revolution high in your hands, come! Pashtun Youth, raise the red flags of revolution, The land cries for revolution, The revolution that can ensure freedom for all,” reads one of his most popular songs composed in 1987.

Sitting on the floor of a dilapidated music hall in Peshawar in front of empty chairs that have not been occupied for years, Alam recalls how men would sit on one side and women on the other as he enamoured them with his music. People would shower flowers as he came on stage. His voice brought audiences to tears. Yet, under the influence of ultra-conservatives, authorities harassed him and his family and ultimately shut down the concert hall, saying they could no longer ensure public security in the face of violent opposition to expressions of traditional and non-religious culture.

“Now the hall is filled with silence. One feels scared… If you remove culture from a nation, that nation dies. We have a centuries old tradition of music. The traditions have been attacked, murdered. It’s left us all deeply depressed,” Alam says.

Threatening phone calls persuaded him to no longer perform in the Northwest Frontier Province. He tried to find gigs in the port city of Karachi, but there, he faced a different problem: ethnic violence against Pashtuns. The situation was no different in Baluchistan. In total, he moved and his family moved 18 times to evade the threats.

In Karachi, he landed in the firing lines of ethnic violence against Pashtuns and returned with his family and without income to Peshawar where his older brother refused to take him because it would put his family in danger. Alam, his wife and five children, now cram into three dank, dark rooms with no running water. “It’s like falling from the sky to earth,” says Rukhsana Muqaddas, Alam’s wife. “Before this we had a very modern, wonderful life. We used to send our kids to good schools. Now, we can’t afford to educate them at all.”169

Alam recalls performing at a wedding with a group of musicians in the Swat Valley in 2008. They were ambushed by armed men emerging from the bushes on a mountain road as they were returning home from their performance.

“All of sudden men jumped out. They opened fire. Many people were hit, including my friend, Anwar Gul,” a renowned composer and harmonium player. “He died later in the hospital,” Alam said, his voice trailing. Months later he was hit by a car and walks with the aid of a stick ever since. “We humans are social beings, we need friends but so many of them have died and I am now alone. I take sleeping pills to calm my nerves but I believe my death will soon come as well,” he adds.170

In one of the few music shops still open in Peshawar, Alam points to CDs by a host of well-known musicians. “Shah Wali, he’s in Canada; Naghma, she’s in America; and Sardar Ali Takkar, he’s also in America; he’s also in America,” Alam says, pointing a finger at yet another CD. “I’ve had chances to leave and have been offered asylum but I never thought it would get this bad. Now it’s too late, other countries won’t accept us. I gave 35 years to music and I’m 55 years old, I no longer know what to do. I can’t support my family,” Alam says, explaining why he didn’t follow his friends and colleagues into exile.

Alam’s native Peshawar and Swat Valley nestled in the foothills of the Hindu Kush, illustrates the corroding impact of Saudi-backed ultra-conservatism as well as government policies that were supported the kingdom and served its foreign and soft power policies. The region once boasted a vibrant cultural life punctured by concerts, theatre performances, art exhibitions, festivals and poetry recitals. All of that has been replaced by countless madrassahs and ultra-conservative religious and jihadist literature and education curricula. A cultural hub was transformed into a hotbed of inward-looking, intolerant worldviews initially populated by the mujahedeen confronting the Soviets in nearby Afghanistan and their successors, the Taliban.

A study conducted by the Pakhtunkhwa Cultural Foundation, a Peshawar-based group that aims to confront the erosion of culture, concluded that “the Wahabi school of thought gained influence in the society due to political developments and state patronage, and particularly in the wake of the war in Afghanistan. Ideologues of the Wahabi school consider artistic expression against Islam. Groups such as Tablighi preachers sprang up during the period and rendered great damage declaring songs, films and anything artistic to be obscene… The sharp decline in socio-cultural life has created a vacuum that is being filled by religious missionaries…The lack of action of the Pakistani government to support the development of cultural industries, together with the lack of a strategy on the part of the incumben","Sat, 30 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://i2.wp.com/www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mecca.jpg?fit=825%2C510&ssl=1,"['arabia', 'islam', 'deobandi', 'muslim', 'south', 'saudi', 'madrassas', 'islamic', 'analysis', 'pakistani', 'religious', 'frankenstein', 'creating', 'ultraconservatism', 'export', 'pakistan', 'asia', 'impact']",

But few politicians would blame Big Oil for ecosystem abuse in a state where the industry employs up to 300,000 people and injects $73 billion into the economy.

Until now.

Following the lead of Gov. John Bel Edwards, Louisiana political orthodoxy is being turned upside-down as prominent leaders of both parties join lawsuits seeking billions of dollars for environmental improvement projects.

Down in the pancake-flat bayou, it’s not easy to see what made so much of the coast sink into the Gulf of Mexico.

Even when you climb onto the levee, buzzing with dragonflies, that keeps the old delta farming community of Alliance from being swallowed, all that’s visible is marshland, stretching toward a green horizon.

But land’s end is much closer now, and what remains has been disrupted. Access canals carved by the oil industry run straight as arrows, rusting signs warn of underwater pipelines and abandoned drilling platforms sink into the muck. As the Alliance refinery billows with fumes, the surrounding pastures are slowly sinking.

Louisiana remains the nation’s second-largest crude oil producer and oil refiner after Texas, but the industry has been on the defensive since Edwards, a 49-year-old lawyer and Democrat, ended eight years of Republican leadership last November.

Publicly, he joined a campaign by local governments suing to hold the industry at least partly responsible for Louisiana’s loss of 1,900 square miles of coast since the 1930s. Privately, he pushed for a pre-trial settlement to resolve all their claims.

“Our coast is in crisis,” Edwards wrote in a letter to oil executives after their initial meeting in May, calling for an “amicable solution” to avoid years of litigation.

He was soon seconded by New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, whose family of Louisiana Democrats long supported Big Oil. Landrieu accused former state leaders of allowing the industry to cripple “in a generation or two what Mother Nature built in 7,000 years,” and said the damage has spread “through the marsh like an infection.

In July, Vermilion Parish, deep in Louisiana’s “Oil Patch,” became the fourth local government to file claims against Exxon, Shell, Chevron and dozens of other corporations. The agency overseeing flood protection for New Orleans also is suing. Republicans have joined in, from GOP-led parishes to Attorney General Jeff Landry.

“It’s absolutely new,” pollster Bernie Pinsonat said. “The oil companies are taking it seriously because you’re talking about billions and billions of dollars.”

This political shift can be traced to Hurricane Katrina, which shocked the nation and exposed the dire state of ecology in the Mississippi River’s delta. Katrina alone tore up about 60 square miles of marsh around New Orleans in 2005.

At issue are oilfields like the one in Alliance, in Plaquemines Parish, where oil companies are accused of routinely abandoning open waste pits, carelessly dumping toxic brine and oilfield waste onto the marsh and interrupting the delta’s ebbs and flows by dredging thousands of miles of canals that weren’t filled back in.

The oil industry blames the Army Corps of Engineers, whose levees deny the delta its natural deposits of silt and sand while channeling the Mississippi River out to sea. It also blames the clear-cutting of coastal forests more than a century ago, shipping channels that have sliced up the delta and even the invasive nutria, an oversized marsh grass-eating rodent.

“It’s just such a vague attempt by the plaintiffs to throw a blanket over an entire industry and hold it singularly responsible for a problem that’s got multiple causes,” said Robert Meadows, a Chevron lawyer.

The legal case requires analyzing thousands of coastal drilling permits and oil leases, putting prices on the unmitigated damage caused by each company, and then dueling over demands for compensation.

Scientists generally agree that between 30 percent and 40 percent of wetlands loss is attributable to drilling and its associated activities, said John Day, a Louisiana State University scientist and expert on the delta’s problems.

“The factual basis is terribly strong: If I were a plaintiffs’ counsel, I’d put on a five-day slide show narrated by geologists and hydrologists and wetlands scientists, and it would be devastating,” said Oliver Houck, an environmental law professor at Tulane University in New Orleans.

Geologist Sherwood Gagliano, who has studied the coastal crisis since the 1960s, contends that extracting millions of barrels of oil and gas from below the surface has caused vast swaths of the coast to sink.

“It’s like an Atlantis oilfield,” Gagliano said. “There are well-heads sticking out of the water. Abandoned production platforms now completely submerged. Oilfields developed on land are now under 5 or 10 feet of water. And that is happening all the way across the coast.”

But F. Rivers LeLong Jr. calls the lawsuits a hypocritical “shakedown cruise” by the same governments that have long profited from drilling.

“They aren’t the good guys any more than the oil companies were,” said LeLong, whose father started the Kenmore Oil Co., which is named as a defendant because it worked the Alliance field before going out of business in 1973. “To act as though they were victims in the process is a fairly laughable characterization.”

What’s gone is gone, but the politicians hope to keep hundreds of other square miles from disappearing. They’re envisioning huge projects to divert sediment flows from the Mississippi River and build up marsh flats, barrier islands, ridges and swamp forests.

It would cost between $50 billion and $100 billion, and Louisiana doesn’t expect to have more than $25 billion to spend.

Suing oil companies “is probably the only new potential source of revenue,” said Mark Davis, who directs Tulane University’s Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy. “Before you tax anybody, you’re going to be required, I think, to show that you’ve tried every other alternative. Is there anybody who owes dollars that have not been collected for this purpose?”

67,67,FL-2016-000075-BGD,Map Men: teaching geography through comedy - Geographical,https://geographical.co.uk/places/mapping/item/1859-map-men-teaching-geography-through-comedy,"Mark Cooper-Jones and Jay Foreman tap into a rich vein of geographical quirks to teach through comedy

‘Maps are probably the best gateway into geography,’ argues comedian Mark Cooper-Jones. ‘They have become trendy, and cool. People are even putting them up on their walls.’

For any geography teacher looking for ways to make the world’s many maps, and the various strange geographical oddities they portray, funny and yet still educational, they should definitely watch Map Men. Short, snappy videos produced and presented by comedian map-fans Cooper-Jones and Jay Foreman, Map Men explores interesting stories about maps from the UK and overseas, merging snippets of educational information with quick-fire jokes and sketches.

‘Comedy is the thing that makes them clickable,’ observes Cooper-Jones. ‘There are other people out there who’ve made informative videos about some of the things that we’ve talked about, but those people have tended not to come from a comedy background. The crucial thing here is the mix of the comedy and the educational side of it. People sit down, hopefully to watch a funny video, but that happens to also be informative. That’s generally the easiest way to disseminate information to people, or so I find anyway.’

The YouTube series covers a wide range of subjects, such as the UK’s north-south divide, the India-Bangladesh enclave situation, and the famous Hereford Mappa Mundi.

‘We’re not always actually talking about the map itself, it’s really all about what the story behind the map is,’ says Cooper-Jones. ‘I wanted to do some more political ones like the South China Sea, or Bir Tawil. Jay, he likes the quirks, so he was very much behind the “maps with gaps”, this idea that there’s this strange gap on a map. But there’s still a long list of other maps that we would like to talk about and discuss. There are so many more maps out there, so we could potentially do hundreds, as many as there are geographical stories, really.’

Mark Cooper-Jones is currently performing his new geography-themed solo stand-up Geographically Speaking at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, following his previous show Geography Teacher.

‘A lot of geography is depressing,’ he argues. ‘So much of geography is inequality, poverty, under-development, extinctions, climate change, whatever it might be. But, given geography’s breadth, there is a lot that you can talk about for stand-up comedy. You can even talk about the depressing stuff. In my show I talk about climate change, but I do a role-play with an audience member, getting them up on the stage and making them play an icecap or the weather. So you’ve just got to find a fun way of making your ultimately depressing points.’

‘For Geographically Speaking, I’m trying to talk about a lot more geography, and move away from only basing it in the classroom and basing it on GCSE-level geographies, like Geography Teacher,’ he says. ‘I talk about some genuinely fairly in-depth geology in this show, some political geography, and of course some silly stuff as well.’

However, she has revealed that her decision to wear the garment wasn't quite what you might expect.

The 31-year-old mother-of-three has revealed that it wasn't a family tradition to wear a headscarf and she discovered it on her own accord - leaving her parents puzzled.

Nadiya Hussain, 31, who found fame as the Great British Bake Off winner, has shared her surprising path to discovering the headscarf

Speaking to The Times, Nadiya explained that she began wearing the scarf 17 years ago when headscarves weren't very common.

She said: 'I spent a lot of time in the school library. I'd go to the RE section. I didn't come from a very religious family at all... but I happened to discover my religion.'

She went on to joke that wearing the scarf was probably a way to cover up her 'bad hair more than anything else' because her father 'cut it really badly.'

She experimented tying the scarf alone in her bedroom as she didn't have anyone to copy or to help her with the technique and used scarves that came with her dresses fastened with safety pins. 'I looked like Tutankhamen. Not a good look,' she joked.

Nadiya explained that she began wearing the scarf 17 years ago when headscarves weren't very common and it wasn't a family tradition to wear one

Nadiya went on to explain that her parents were confused by her decision to wear the scarf but she simply told them she didn't care what society thought and wore it for herself.

She said even people from her native Bangladesh were puzzled by her decision. She added: 'I went to Bangladesh and somebody said: ""Why have you got your head bandaged? Have you injured your head?"" That's how uncommon it was.'

Nadiya was crowned champion of the Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood-fronted baking programme last summer, and has since gone on to enjoy success as a baker in the media.

The talented chef released her first cook book, Nadiya's Kitchen, in June.

Nadiya also writes a column for The Times and made the Queen's 90th birthday cake.

It has just been announced that Nadiya, pictured with her husband, Adbal, will return to our screens as a judge on Junior Bake-off

Additionally, she will front her own TV show, entitled The Chronicles of Nadiya, which will see her trace her culinary roots in Bangladesh.

In fact, it has just been announced that Nadiya will return to our screens as a judge on Junior Bake-off.

The 31-year-old mother-of-three is said to be delighted by her new role.

The Great British Bake Off 2015 champion will lend her knowledge to the CBBC programme alongside international chef and food writer Allegra McEvedy as they judge 40 young bakers on their quest to be the best.

Nadiya was crowned champion of the Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood-fronted baking programme last summer, and has since gone on to enjoy success as a baker in the media

The contestants, aged nine to 12, will each face two challenges over a series of 10 heats, concocting delights such as biscuits, cakes and pastries in their bid to succeed.

Like the original BBC series, the hopefuls will be tasked with the Technical Bake and the Showstopper challenges in the Bake Off tent, before they are whittled down from 40 to four for the grand final.

The Luton-born star, who married her husband at the tender age of 19, said: 'I'm delighted to be joining Junior Bake Off as a judge.

“It is the board officials who usually collect the fee, but we thought why not give the responsibility to the RWAs. They have been working very well and this will help them gain more responsibility,” said a senior official of the TNSCB.

Of the total 185 blocks, 12 have residents’ welfare associations that were formed last year. Each association has a president, secretary and a treasurer.

Officials say that these members have been working diligently to ensure proper facilities — such as laying speed breakers and cleaning tanks — for the residents. “They are in constant touch with the board and inform us if they need anything,” the official added.

There are currently over 3,000 flood-affected families resettled at Perumbakkam under the resettlement and rehabilitation scheme.

‘Facilities subpar’

Each month, they pay a maintenance fee of Rs. 250 to the board, which officials say, will soon be collected by the associations themselves. However, residents claim that while they have been paying the sum, the maintenance of the apartments have been subpar.

R. Kripanandan, a daily-wage labourer, pointed out to the water seepage on his ceiling. “The seepage never stops. This is not only the case of my apartment, it’s been there in all houses, ever since we moved in after the floods,” he said.

S. Kaniamma, another resident, said, “There is only one ration shop for 3,000 families. The school functions from the ground floor of the building. These need to be addressed urgently. While we have been paying the maintenance amount, we expect a decent life in return.

By Ed King

Think about countries you might associate with leadership on climate change.

Did you pick Hungary? Well think again: Budapest is home to an unlikely climate leader.

A lawyer-turned-politician, Janos Ader was elected President of the Republic in 2012, and his 1980s popstar moustache belies his progressive stance on tackling global warming.

Last month, Ader wrote a letter to the heads of state from the world’s top 10 greenhouse gas polluters. The message was simple: set an example and tighten your reduction targets.

“We suggested to the 10 top emitters they should speed up the implementation of the Paris Agreement and it might make sense for those states to go ahead and start ratcheting up,” said Csaba Kőrösi, head of the president’s environmental sustainability directorate.

“If they move, it would be a good example for the rest of the word to follow – for sure. We were hoping his push could be part of a larger diplomatic push.”

A former Hungarian ambassador to the UN, Kőrösi told Climate Home the letters were specific to each country. China, the US, Japan and Canada were among the recipients.

Former US president and climate hawk Al Gore was consulted before the letters were sent; so too was the recently departed UK prime minister David Cameron.

In April, 175 governments signed the new Paris Climate Agreement, a record for a new international treaty.

But given a spate of broken temperature records and extreme weather events across the planet, Ader felt he should take the initiative, said Kőrösi.

“He has very attentive ears to science. Some politicians do pay attention…. some others a little lower. He is one of those who tries to alarm the others and motivate action,” he said.

More was to follow: Hungary’s parliament became the first in the EU to ratify the Paris deal, with a unanimous vote from lawmakers in late May.

Climate Home understands Ader, who hails from the same centre-right Fidesz party as prime minister Victor Orban, was instrumental in ensuring the quick approval.

Still, his influence has limits. It’s a position that, like his counterparts in Germany and Austria, is largely confined to ceremonial tasks: “powerless,” in the words of one Hungarian political observer.

Critics of the government argue Orban is far from a green leader, keen to embrace fossil fuels and Russian nuclear technology while dismissing the potential of renewables.

Gas accounts for 34% of the country’s energy mix, according to a government brief, nuclear 17%, oil 25%, coal 10%, while biomass dominates the 8% of renewables.

The right-wing populist Jobbik party – the country’s third largest political force – issued a withering press release during last December’s Paris climate summit, accusing Fidesz and Orban of inaction.

“While Áder keeps campaigning for the drastic reduction of gas emissions causing the climate change, he fails to voice criticism of the Fidesz government’s domestic actions that are quite contrary to this agenda,” said Jobbik MP Lajos Kepli.

“He sees no problem with the taxation on solar panels, he is not bothered by the arbitrary cessation of energy efficiency tenders and neither was he bothered by the gradual deterioration of Hungarian environment protection, including the non-existent wind power plant development projects.”

Andra Lukacs, president of Hungarian environmental NGO Levego Munkacsoport, sees Ader’s office as an anomaly in an administration he describes as “bad for the environment”.

This month the country’s energy efficiency association closed, he said, because members saw little evidence their alliance or lobbying was changing government policy.

A special tax has been raised on the sale of solar panels, while Lukacs said no new wind turbine has been built since 2006 “with the pretext that the grid could not cope with more”.

It paints a bleak picture, but it’s one that will change over time, said Kőrösi, who argued awareness over the threat posed by rising temperatures is growing.

Last year there were 40 days when the top temperature was about 30C, above Hungary’s usual extremes. A 2014 EU study of climate change in the Carpathian mountains suggested temperatures could rise 3-4.5C by 2100.

“Hungary is more exposed to climate change than the European average. 80% of the changes we are experiencing are through water… we are vulnerable to [flood] water across borders,” he said.

“96% of surface water comes from neighbouring mountains… it means if there is a fast melt of snow and heavy rain we are likely to experience flash floods.”

Áder and Orban regularly speak about climate change, he said, while efforts to offer MPs more information, data and the economics of a low carbon transition are ongoing.

Signs are the president’s message is well-received abroad, less so at home. But Kőrösi is undeterred, citing his initial conversation with Áder after taking office.

“When I joined I asked him: what would you consider a success? He said I want climate change and environmental sustainability be constantly among 10 most important questions for the public.”","Fri, 29 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.climatechangenews.com/files/2016/07/Hungary_president_UN_photos_800.jpg,"['leader', 'orban', 'kőrösi', 'water', 'climate', 'unlikely', 'paris', 'ader', 'change', 'hungarys', 'president', 'hungarian', 'jános', 'fidesz', 'áder']",

A beetle menace brought about by climate change in Majuli, a large island on the Brahmaputra River in Assam, has been ingeniously brought under control by turning it into a culinary delicacy

The farmers of Majuli, an island on the Brahmaputra River in Assam, have turned the beetles that attacked their crops into their newest cuisine. Majuli, one of the largest fresh water islands in the world, has been severely infested by the beetle lepidiota mausuet, locally known as the hati-puk, since 2005. It has taken a severe toll on agriculture.

The island has a crop area of over 30,000 hectares, and up to 70% of this is attacked by this pest. Now the farmers, with support from the Assam Agricultural University (AAU), catch the pest before they damage the crops and eat them!

A beetle boom

According to AAU scientists, although the insect was always present on the island, it only became a menace after 2005. They blame climate change for this infestation. Research undertaken by the university show that the pest severely damages potato, sugarcane and green gram cultivation. As a result of this, thousands of farmers have been affected.

“The insect is found in such large numbers only in Majuli, probably because of the soil content and availability of water,” said Badal Bhattacharyya, Senior Scientist and Principal Investigator at the Department of Entomology of AAU.

According to Bhattacharyya, increase in temperature, erratic rainfall and early onset of summer, has led to an increase to the beetle population. At the same time, the migratory Siberian crane (Grus leucogeranus), which is a major predator of the pest, has stopped wintering there. “The Siberian crane used to ensure that the beetle is kept in check, but nowadays the bird rarely comes here,” he said.

A beetle cuisine emerges

However, now the people don’t need the Siberian crane to catch the beetle, as they have developed delicious beetle dishes, which have gained immense popularity among the people. Bhattacharyya and his research team have been popularizing the dish with the slogan, “Eat it before it eats your crops.”

On being asked if the beetle was safe to eat, he explained that at the university research was carried out on the beetle, and it was found that it is rich in protein and carbohydrates, and there is no toxic content and the insect could be nutritional food for humans and poultry.

The many dishes made from the beetle: roasted beetle fry with tomato, plain roasted beetle and beetle curry have gained popularity. According to locals, it tastes like prawn. “We started these dishes here three years back and it has been a huge hit, and became popular instantly. Apart from local people, even tourists have tasted the dishes and have liked those,” said Milanjyoti Kuli, a farmer from the Kuli-chapori village in Majuli who is taking steps to popularize these dishes.

Marketing the Pestaurant

Kuli, with support from the AAU, have started an eatery dubbed Pestaurant, which prepares these dishes for the locals and tourists. Kuli added that the dishes have not been priced yet, and presently the mission is just to popularize these dishes further.

“The results have been much better than our expectations and very soon we plan to start a few restaurants which will sell these dishes, and we are confident that it will be a huge success as Majuli is a major tourism destination for both domestic and foreign tourists,” said Kuli. He said that the university has already launched a campaign to popularize the dishes all across the island.

Locals pointed out that there is an opportunity for entrepreneurship as well, since the dishes are universally popular, and safe to eat. “We will start a restaurant next year on the island, and if it yields good results, we might plan to launch the dishes outside Majuli as well,” said Bhubon Bora, a local youth from the Kamalabari village in Majuli. Bora added that the basic raw material for the dishes – the beetles – comes for free, so it is a venture worth undertaking.

Killing the beetle to stop the grubs

The real target, though, is not the mature beetle but its grub. “The white grub lives in the soil for nearly two years before reaching maturity, all the while gnawing at the roots of crop and causing widespread damage. The adult beetle does not feed on any plant, so the concern is the grub,” said Bhattacharyya.

He pointed out that the ideal time to catch the beetle and to reduce their population is the period between April to June, when they come out to mate. After that they burrow deep underground and produce 30-35 eggs in one batch. At these depths insecticides do not reach them.

To deal with the situation the villagers have been mobilized to catch the beetles when they come out to mate. Farmers groups are formed, with ten farmers in each group, and they have played a major role in spreading information on how to deal with the menace. There are now 40 such groups.

“We catch them by shining light on the fields as they are attracted to light, and in these two months thousands of beetles are caught,” said Bhattacharyya.

The initiative started in 2012 through mass campaigning, and between April to June that year over 43,000 beetles were caught. “The beetles are caught using solar LED light traps, and are placed in both cultivated and non-cultivated areas,” he said. This year the farmers had caught 170,000 thousand beetles.

Farmers had suffered to the point of giving up, but this beetle catching has changed their prospects. Jibon Payeng, another farmer from the Kuli-Chapori village, said that in 2011 he had almost made up his mind to look for other earning options.

“However after 2012 things seem to have returned to normalcy, and the pest attacks have reduced greatly. We are hopeful that within the next few years, things will further improve,” said Payeng.","Wed, 10 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://indiaclimatedialogue.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1.-Lead.jpg,"['turns', 'eat', 'university', 'beetle', 'delicacy', 'island', 'dishes', 'beetles', 'catch', 'majuli', 'farmers', 'pest']",

Two separate persons (one a legal person and the other a natural person) may “split” the ownership of contiguous property. Regardless of the client’s status as the association or individual unit owner, one key question must be answered to design the insurance program correctly: Who is responsible for what property?

Who Insures Which Property?

Associational responsibility is divided into three levels: original specifications, all-in and bare walls. And each definition presented in this article is from the association’s perspective – delineating which part of the real property the association must insure. Property not insured by the association must be protected by the unit owner’s insurance policy.

To fully understand the three levels of associational responsibility first requires the four categories of condominium real property be specifically described and understood. Condominium real property is classified as either a: 1) common element; 2) limited common element; 3) unit property or 4) unit improvements and betterments.

Common elements are owned by and benefit all or nearly all members of the association. Land, parking lots and the building’s structural foundations and load-bearing walls are examples of common elements. Also included in this definition are club houses, pool houses,

pools, fences, gates, playground equipment, tennis courts and other property owned by and allocated to all unit owners. Not all property categorized as a common element is insurable in standard property policies (i.e. land), but most can be scheduled.

Also included in this definition are club houses, pool houses, pools, fences, gates, playground equipment, tennis courts and other property owned by and allocated to all unit owners. Not all property categorized as a common element is insurable in standard property policies (i.e. land), but most can be scheduled. Limited common elements are beneficial to more than one but less than all unit owners. Common hallways or corridors providing access to several units, walls and columns containing electrical wiring or sprinkler piping serving or protecting multiple units or a plenum enclosure providing heating and cooling to multiple units are examples. Doorsteps, stoops, decks, porches, balconies, patios, exterior doors and windows or other fixtures designed to serve a single unit but located outside the unit’s boundaries are often categorized as limited common elements because the appearance and safety of these fixtures directly affects multiple unit owners although connected to just one unit.

Unit property is defined by the association’s declarations or statute and is limited to and benefits none but the unit owner. The inside of the exterior walls, interior partition walls, counter tops, cabinetry, plumbing fixtures, appliances and any other real property confined to the unit are examples. Unit property’s definition can vary widely with no universal designation.

is defined by the association’s declarations or statute and is limited to and benefits none but the unit owner. The inside of the exterior walls, interior partition walls, counter tops, cabinetry, plumbing fixtures, appliances and any other real property confined to the unit are examples. Unit property’s definition can vary widely with no universal designation. Unit improvements and betterments like unit property benefit none but the unit owner. The three previous definitions of associational responsibility classifications require improvements and betterments be classed separately – excluding improvements and betterments from the definition of covered property under the association’s policy.

A unit improvements and betterments is created by the unit owner’s engagement in any activity or improvement that increases the value of the real property within an individual unit – such as updating the flooring from carpet to hardwood or other such improvements.

Levels of Associational Responsibility Explained

Original specification requirements, known as single entity coverage, make the association responsible for the common elements, limited common elements and unit property. Unit improvements and betterments are not the responsibility of the association. Connecting the pieces:

The association insures the common elements, limited common elements and unit property;

Unit owners insure unit improvements and betterments and their personal property within the unit.

All in (all inclusive) requirements differ from original specification wording in one major aspect: the association’s additional responsibility to insure unit improvements and betterments. In addition to insuring common elements, limited common elements and unit property, associations extending protection on an all in basis are also charged with insuring unit improvements and betterments. If the association provides all-in protection, then:

The association insures common elements, limited common elements, unit property and unit improvements and betterments;

Unit owners insure only personal property within the unit.

Bare walls wording limits associational insurance responsibility to the common elements and limited common elements. To complete the puzzle:

The association insures the common elements and the limited common elements;

Unit owners are tasked with insuring unit property, any unit improvements and betterments and the owner’s personal property within the unit.

At issue in bare wall situations is the definition of unit. Unit does not have a universal or even uniform definition. Unit boundaries, the beginning of the area the association is not responsible for insuring, can be everything from the studs; or the unfinished walls (meaning the paint is insured by the unit owner); or the sub-floor and underside of the ceiling, or any other variation.

NFIP – A Special Case

Two standard flood insurance policies (SFIPs) connect in condominium forms of ownership: the Residential Condominium Building Association Policy (RCBAP) provides coverage for the association and the Dwelling Form is purchased by the individual unit owner to cover personal property. These forms apply as per NFIP standards regardless of any statutory or associational declaration regarding insurance responsibility.

The RCBAP policy form specifically states that coverage is provided for all real property to include real property that is part of the unit.

FEMA guidelines further clarify in rule “IV. COVERAGE: A. Property Covered: The entire building is covered under one policy, including both the common as well as individually owned building elements within the units, improvements within the units, and contents owned in common. Contents owned by individual unit owners should be insured under an individual unit owner’s Dwelling Form.”

In essence, the RCBAP is all-in coverage.

Completing the Condo Coverage Picture

Agents for both the association and the unit owner require the same mass of information to complete the condominium puzzle. All the pieces must be available.

To properly write property coverage, agents must have:

A copy of the association’s declarations or covenants, conditions and restrictions;

A copy of the applicable state statute;

An official letter documenting the definition of a unit’s boundaries detailing who is responsible for insuring which property. Many agents forego this step, depending on their own experience and knowledge to make this determination. This decision could prove detrimental in court; and

A verifiable or signed property valuation calculation. Due to the intricacies of ownership and various combinations of responsibility to which condominium associations and unit owners are subject, getting a written valuation from a specially trained professional or approval from the insured will be beneficial should any question arise. When insuring personal property only, let the insured value his property.

Insuring individual unit owners requires gathering and piecing together the same detail as does insuring a condominium association. Association and unit owner programs must dovetail seamlessly. Unless both sides utilize the same data, such a clean connection and complete picture is impossible.

But when all is settled, Britain will emerge even stronger from her exiting the European Union. You see, as Prof. Yash Tandon argued recently, the Empire is still alive and kicking as of old.

It is still a hot debate at workplaces and other social spaces. But when all is settled, Britain will emerge even stronger from her exiting the European Union. You see, as Prof. Yash Tandon argued recently, the Empire is still alive and kicking as of old.

The Commonwealth, that grouping of countries that are former British colonies and dominions, will now become the focus of British economic foreign policy, and strategic, cultural and other interests.

Unlike La Francophonie, which is basically a ‘feel good club’ of French-speaking countries, (despite the ‘France-Afrique’ factor), the Commonwealth is a robust organisation with systems and structures in key sectors, including the economy, science, education, culture, et al.

Its investment arm, the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), plays an influential role in most economies of former colonies.

It has long championed British economic interests in the colonies, protectorates, territories, and dominions (and the nomenclature here carries significance).

We all are too aware that the key driver of British colonialism was economic hegemony as evidenced in the outsourcing of the colonial economic management to private companies and mercenary armies: lower primary school history in Uganda tells us of the Imperial British East African Company and its CEO, Fredrick Lugard, buttressed by mercenary commander Emin Pasha.

The fathers of Ugandan Independence (Musaazi and his compatriots) were driven by the economic question. The East Indian Company managed India, which at the time included Pakistan and Bangladesh.

In other key areas such as education, Britain still plays an influential role in the syllabi, curricular both in terms of content and financing its development, dissemination and implementation. British universities still hold a central place in the education of Africans, both private and scholarship students, at all levels.

Freed from the yoke of ‘collective responsibility’ in most engagements where Britain had to contribute to EU programmes, while at the same time emphasising her own influence through UKAid, her scope will now be wider and deeper, and soon, we may see changed trends in such arrangements as the EAC-EU EPAs, where Germany had an upper hand.

Britain will be able to negotiate with individual countries in the EAC as well having UK-EAC arrangements. This is significant considering Britain’s special relationship with Kenya.

We will see more country-specific agreements than EAC ones, with each country in the bloc playing to outcompete the others in the eyes of the suitor. Extrapolate this to the Indian sub-continent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal) plus South East Asia, the Caribbean-Pacific, and you will see the empire rising.

At the turn of her independence, India was the largest and most profitable British colony and, despite independence, the economic and cultural ties between the two countries remain strong. And this not to talk of its First World dominions: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the scores of British Isles spread across the Pacific Ocean.

Strange as it may sound, one other area that will in the long run benefit Britain is the question of migrants from her former colonies. When the smaller and poorer economies of Eastern Europe attained EU membership, there was a flood of non-skilled workers to Western Europe, including Britain.

Despite being unskilled, and unable to speak English, they had priority over English-speaking Africans when it came to employment and related benefits. This is because they are EU citizens, thus entitled to rights and opportunities like any other British citizen.

With the ever-growing unemployment in Africa, African university graduates, skilled and English-speaking, and able to go for less pay and related perks, will be a better bargain for British farms, factories and homes. Even Francophone Africans learn English faster than eastern European non-English speakers, so UK will tap beyond her empire.

Besides economic refuges largely in their youth years, London remains the crucible for Anglophone African political squabbles. Virtually all ‘rebel’ movements, political dissidents and asylum seekers have Britain as their first-stop, and their presence become a bargaining chip in British relations with its former colonies.

Another sphere of British influence is the NGO sector, also known as civil society, development sector, not-for-profit, et al. British-founded or based NGOs call shots in most Commonwealth LDCS, where some do run mini-governments offering support in education, health, agriculture, food and nutritional security, HIV/AIDS, gender, and other ‘cross-cutting’ issues!

And the Africa I know is centuries away from weaning herself from this ‘development partner’ syndrome. We all are aware of one Commonwealth country whose parliament is an NGO-forum on its own: each sector of the economy and society has a ‘Parliamentary Forum’ bankrolled by ‘development partners’.

78,78,FL-2016-000075-BGD,Thomas Friedman Goes to the Wall - RollingStone.com,https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/thomas-friedman-goes-to-the-wall-93919/,"Thomas Friedman, master of metaphor, has a new set of fixations: walls, webs and the tacking of that presidentially-contending center-left sailboat, Hillary Clinton.

In a pair of recent articles, “Web People Versus Wall People” and “How Clinton Could Knock Trump Out,” the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for the New York Times expresses deep concern that Clinton’s primary-season “lean” toward the politics of Bernie Sanders isn’t fake enough.

It’s been a whole week since the convention, and Hillary still hasn’t yet gone back to being the unabashed friend to big banks and staunch advocate for free trade and deregulation she just spent all of last year pretending she was not. This has Friedman freaked out.

He fears she is leaning in the direction of socialism, “the greatest system ever invented for making people equally poor,” as opposed to staying true to the capitalist ethos of her husband, which would “grow our pie bigger and faster”:

I get that she had to lean toward Sanders and his voters to win the nomination; their concerns with fairness and inequality are honorable. But those concerns can be addressed only with economic growth…

Friedman is conceding that inequality and unfairness are legitimate concerns. He’s just saying that now that the people most concerned about these issues have been beaten at the polls, we can safely go back to ignoring them and letting the beneficiaries of inequality worry about how and when to fix it.

This “let’s grow our pie bigger and faster” column (does this make more or less sense than George Bush’s famous “we should make the pie higher” idea?) comes on the heels of last week’s “Webs and Walls” column on the same theme.

This remarkable article divided the world into two groups of people. Roughly speaking, Friedman is talking about people who embrace globalization (“Web people”) versus people who reject it (“Wall people”).

This is already a confusing metaphor because the campaigns of the two candidates Friedman identifies as riling up the “Wall” people, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, were heavily reliant on Internet media, i.e. the Web.

Meanwhile, Friedman’s definition of “web people” describes individuals who:

Instinctively understand that Democrats and Republicans both built their platforms largely in response to the Industrial Revolution, the New Deal and the Cold War, but that today, a 21st-century party needs to build its platform in response to the accelerations in technology, globalization and climate change, which are the forces transforming the workplace, geopolitics and the very planet.

That seems like a very specific and weird belief system, probably unique to writers for the New York Times named Thomas Friedman. Also, Friedman never explains what any of this has to do with “webs” – is it an Internet thing? Do they have webbed hands?

But whatever, we get it, sort of. “Web people” embrace the future and “open systems,” i.e. free trade, bringing us closer to the heart of what Friedman is talking about.

Friedman is right that this election, like the Brexit vote, has really been a referendum on globalization. What’s infuriating is the cartoonish way he defines the critics of globalization.

“Wall people” in his mind are either xenophobic Trumpites who don’t want a flood of dirty, rapey immigrants entering their towns, or they’re Sanders socialists who don’t want to compete with foreign workers and insist on government handouts.

With regard to the latter, what troubles Friedman the most is the way Hillary is cozying up to her critics on the left:

She is opposing things she helped to negotiate, like the Pacific trade deal, and offering more benefits from government but refraining from telling people the hardest truth: that to be in the middle class, just working hard and playing by the rules doesn’t cut it anymore. To have a lifelong job, you need to be a lifelong learner, constantly raising your game.

Yes, to get by these days, working hard isn’t enough to keep a job. You need to be “constantly raising your game.” Either that, or you need to marry a shopping mall heiress and write books fawning over Fortune 500 companies.

Friedman’s glib definition of globalization goes virtually unchallenged in the pundit-o-sphere, which by and large agrees with him that critics of globalism are either racists or afraid of capitalism.

But this issue is infinitely more complicated than that.

We never really had a referendum on globalization in America. It just sort of happened. People had jobs one day, then the next morning they were fired, replaced by 14-year-olds in Indonesia or sweatshop laborers in Bangladesh, working in unsafe hell-holes without overtime or health care, beaten when they don’t make quotas.

What exactly does “raising your game” mean in the context of that sort of competition?

Globalization in the snap of a finger essentially erased nearly two centuries of America’s bloody labor history. It’s as if the Thibodeaux Massacre, the hangings of the Molly McGuires, the Pullman Strike, the L.A. Times bombing, the Flint sit-in and thousands of other strikes and confrontations never took place.

“Friedman’s glib definition of globalization goes virtually unchallenged in the pundit-o-sphere, which by and large agrees with him that critics of globalism are either racists or afraid of capitalism.”

In the new paradigm, all of those agonizing controversies and wars of political attrition, which collectively produced a vast set of rules and standards for dealing with workers, were simply wiped away.

Manufacturers just went abroad, to dictatorships and communist oligarchies, to make their products, forcing American workers to compete not just against foreign workers, but against their own history and legal systems.

People forget that when it comes to labor relations, America had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, in the direction of the civilized world. Attempts to ban child labor in this country failed repeatedly, and we didn’t actually pass a federal child labor law that stuck until 1938. Airlines in America were still firing flight attendants for getting married through the mid-eighties.

Now all that work spent to get even past those most basic problems is at risk. In the global economy, employers can look at their business models as one giant arbitrage.

You do your banking in the laissez-faire havens of the Caribbean, build factories in slave-labor capitals like China or Indonesia, buy swaps in less-regulated financial atmospheres in London, sell your products in America and Europe, etc.

You also arrange your corporate structures so that you pay the smallest amount of tax possible, often by threatening to move until you receive subsidies and exemptions. This leads to bizarre situations like Boeing making $26 billion in U.S. profits over a five-year period and receiving a U.S. federal tax refund of $401 million over the same time.

This whole situation has raised profound questions that nobody has ever bothered to try to answer for ordinary voters, as in: What are nation-states for, in a global economy?

What’s the point of all of our labor laws, or voting-rights laws, the first amendment and a host of other American legal traditions if large pluralities of American manufacturers do their business in countries like China, where human rights abuses are rampant, political freedom is nonexistent and speech is tightly controlled?

Friedman’s description of “Wall People” is probably somewhat true when it comes to Trump voters, many of whom do just want to be physically walled off from a confusing, racially diverse world.

But to dismiss the rest of globalization’s critics as communists who hate freedom and just want to curl up in the lap of government and hide from change is absurd and insulting.

Most educated people accept and embrace the idea of an increasingly integrated world. The problem is how to go forward into the future in a way that’s fair and doesn’t increase oppression, pollution, child labor, even slavery and indenture, to say nothing of the disenfranchisement of the ex-middle class in places like America.

These are very difficult questions. They’re ones that probably won’t have positive solutions without the determined leadership of the world’s bigger democratic powers, like the U.S. and the E.U.

The problem is that the major parties in the United States in particular seem almost totally disinterested in addressing the inequities of globalism. That’s because conventional wisdom is still stuck in the Friedman stage of telling people that if they’re troubled by the global economy, they’re just afraid of the future.

Because the Murphy’s Law tendency of American politics demands that we draw every conceivable wrong lesson from an event before accidentally stumbling in the direction of progress, the twin revolts in the 2016 presidential race will surely be misinterpreted for a good long while by the Friedmans of the world.

They won’t see the anti-establishment backlash as a reason to re-examine the impact of globalism on ordinary people. Instead, as Friedman puts it, they’ll see an opportunity to build a single ruling coalition of “center-left Web People” (what a creepy image!) who will dominate the next generation of American politics:

My hope is that, for the good of the country, Republican Web People will, over time, join the Democratic Party and tilt it into a compassionate, center-left Web party for the 21st Century. That would be a party that is sensitive to the needs of working people … but committed to capitalism, free markets and open trade as the vital engines of growth for a modern society.

Yes, let’s be sensitive to the needs of working people, unless they have complaints about globalism, in which case we’ll put our webbed hands over our ears and ignore them.

79,79,FL-2016-000075-BGD,Shatter cones: (Mis)understood? - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/8/e1600616,"Using shatter cones to estimate crater size

One of the first and most important questions asked about any impact crater is “how big is it?” For craters on other planetary bodies where recent or ongoing plate tectonics, volcanism, and active erosional processes are lacking, determining crater size is relatively straightforward and is achieved by measuring the diameter of the topographically high crater rim (35). On Earth, erosion and other geological processes have either destroyed or obscured the topographic rim at the vast majority of impact craters. Thus, other methods to determine the size of a crater are required. For the majority of the impact structures on Earth, the apparent crater diameter (D a ) is the only measurable diameter and is defined as “the diameter of the outermost ring of (semi-) continuous concentric normal faults” (Fig. 2A) (35). Unfortunately, in the majority of the terrestrial craters, there is too little exposure to allow detailed mapping to be conducted, the structures are buried and lack detailed seismic studies, or there have simply not been any detailed field studies performed.

Because of these limitations, previous workers have turned to using the spatial distribution of various impact phenomena (for example, shatter cones, PDFs in quartz, impact breccia dikes, and diameter of the melt sheet) to estimate crater size. Several studies have used the suggestion that the limit of shatter cones is ≤D tc (transient cavity diameter) [for example, Grieve et al. (45) and Therriault et al. (46)]. This provides only a very crude estimate, and furthermore, determining the diameter of the transient cavity for most craters is extremely difficult, or impossible, because it is destroyed during the modification stage of complex crater formation (2). In a related study, the diameter of the zone of shatter cones for the Carswell, Ries, and Rochechouart impact structures was reported to be 0.80, >0.5, and 0.59 D tc , respectively (47), although no observational data were provided on which to gauge these values. The only other previous study to attempt to relate shatter cone distribution to apparent crater diameter is the work of Lakomy (48), which was only reported in a non–peer-reviewed conference abstract. This author provides a plot of the maximum radial extent of various shock features versus apparent crater diameter. Neither the data on which the plot is based nor the references from which the data were obtained are provided; however, most craters yield estimates of ~D sc = 0.5 to 0.6 D a .

One of the major results of our fieldwork at the Haughton and Tunnunik impact structures is the determination of the relationship D sc = 0.4 D a . We suggest that this relationship represents a substantial improvement over previous estimates for the following two fundamental reasons. First, the apparent crater diameter (D a ) for both the Haughton and Tunnunik structures has been determined to be better than ±1 km. Second, the disappearance of shatter cones that delineates the diameter of the zone of shatter cones (D sc ) has been determined to be better than ±1 km. We suggest that this is the main reason for the discrepancy between our estimate for D sc and that of previous studies (47, 48). It is also important to note that the rim (final crater) diameter (D) (35) (Fig. 2A), which is calculated in numerical models and measured in pristine planetary craters, is typically not known for terrestrial craters and is not the same as D a [D < D a (35)]. However, it has been constrained from field mapping at 16 km for Haughton (37), which results in the relationship D sc = 0.55 D a .

How applicable is the relationship D sc = 0.4 D a to other craters? It is important to note that the relationship D sc = 0.4 D a is only applicable for shatter cones that are unequivocally in situ within the central uplift. Thus, with a few caveats and on the basis of the following discussion, we suggest that this relationship is applicable for all complex impact craters on Earth in the range of >2 km to ~150 km in diameter. We suggest these limits because craters in this size range typically display similar attributes [that is, a central core of uplifted rocks, a surrounding relatively flat crater floor, and a faulted rim zone (49)]. Smaller craters will be either simple or so-called transitional craters, in which the spatial extent of shatter cones may be different because of less collapse during the modification stage. At diameters above ~150 to 200 km on Earth, the central uplifted core or central peak is replaced with a peak ring, as in the case of the 180-km-diameter Chicxulub impact structure, Mexico (50). Although the origin of peak rings is still debated, it seems likely that the outward collapse of an original central peak occurs (51), which would obviously completely alter the distribution of shock effects, including shatter cones.

In terms of erosion level, we are confident that the relationship holds for a wide range of erosion levels given the similarity in D sc between Haughton [erosion <200 m (34)] and Tunnunik [erosion >1 km (18)]. A further consideration is target lithology. It is well known that the composition and physical properties of the target rocks affect many aspects of the impact cratering process. Although the effect on impact melting and impactites is relatively well understood (52, 53), the physics of rock failure and deformation during crater collapse is not (54). Of relevance to this discussion is the comparative numerical modeling (55) and field and laboratory (53) study of midsize impact craters in crystalline versus sedimentary targets, which considered the similarly sized Haughton, Ries, Mistastin, and El’gygytgyn impact structures. These studies showed that the distribution of shock pressures is not significantly different in sedimentary or crystalline rocks [for example, Fig. 3 in Osinski et al. (53) shows that the 2-GPa shock isobar is at approximately the same radial distance ±1 km in the Haughton, Ries, and El’gygytgyn models]. However, porosity in the target rocks was not considered in these models. In a study of impact melt production, Wünnemann et al. (56) showed that the shock wave decays faster in more porous materials, which would decrease the radial extent of shock isobars and, therefore, also reduce D sc in more porous targets. However, this is effectively cancelled out by the fact that porosity reduces the shock pressures required for melting (56). The lowering of the threshold for melting in more porous targets is mirrored in certain shock-metamorphic effects. For example, diaplectic glass forms at pressures as low as 5.5 GPa in sedimentary rocks (57), whereas it forms at a pressure of ~32.5 GPa in crystalline rocks (58). Unfortunately, to our knowledge, experiments or models looking at shatter formation in porous versus nonporous targets have not been carried out to date.","Fri, 05 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/8/e1600616/F1.large.jpg,"['misunderstood', 'shock', 'cones', 'sc', 'crater', 'craters', 'diameter', 'km', 'd', 'shatter', 'impact']",

Visakhapatnam: Thanks to the Pattiseema canal that links the rivers Godavari and Krishna, the famous Godavari Pulasa, a kind of fish, which commands high price in international market, is likely to make a maiden entry into Krishna.

Scientifically called Tenualosa ilisha, Pulasa belongs to herring family Clupeidae. It is popular in South Asia. In fact, Pulasa is a sea fish that swims up the river to lays eggs. After fertilisation in the river water, Pulasa hatchlings swim back to the sea. Pulasa is also caught in the sea. But the ones caught in the river are tastier than those caught in the sea.

Till now, there is no Pulasa in the Krishna. It is available only in the Godavari and the Ganges.

Fisheries officials said due to the diversion of the water from the Godavari to the Krishna through the Pattiseema project, there is a chance of the Godavari Pulasa migrating to the Krishna.

Visakhapatnam district fisheries joint director VV Rao said migration may take place after Krishna Pushkaralu, which is slated to begin on August 12. The survival rate of the Pulasa hatchlings or eggs is less during the Pushkaralu as the water is highly polluted due to the presence of toxic materials in the river. ""Pollution of water and presence of E coli bacteria caused by waste generated from puja offerings in the Krishna water will not support the growth of Pulasa. We can expect a good amount of Pulasa fish in the Krishna only after Pushkaralu,"" Rao said. He added that the Godavari Pulasa was sold for Rs 5,000 a kilo last year.

A Pulasa can lay nearly five lakh eggs. The survival rate of eggs is about 30%.

Rao said the fish swims upwards to the mouth of the Godavari from the Bay of Bengal at flood during southwest monsoon. The fish swims upwards from areas such as Yanam, Kapileswarapuram, Kotipalli, Alamur and Ravulapalem to reach Dowleswaram. They come to the river for mating and breeding. The ayacut of river Godavari at Dowleswaram barrage near Rajahmundry in East Godavari district is viable for breeding and mating, Rao said.

Godavari is the third largest breeding area for Pulasa after the Padma in Bangladesh and the Hooghly in West Bengal.

According to PWD officers, the raging river exerted relentless pressure on the arch of the bridge, which gave away resulting in the collapse. On Tuesday night, the swollen river flowed around 0.5 feet above the bridge, with water crashing on the arch and support railings.

""The pillars of the bridge bear the weight, while the arch is mere a support-connect structure between the two pillars. On the night of the incident, we feel the arch of the bridge was pummeled by the river, causing cracks in the arch and then washing it away,"" said PWD officer PP Gaikwad.

Gaikwad, who inspected the fallen bridge along with his team on Wednesday, claimed that after the arch collapsed, the pillars were eroded by the flood-hit Savitri river in no time.

According to the officer, two hours prior to the collapse, a team of PWD officers had driven past the bridge and witnessed the increasing level of water atop the colonial-era bridge. He added that in the pre-monsoon survey — in the month of May — a joint team of NHAI and PWD engineers had inspected the 500-meter-long bridge. ""It was then marked safe for travel,"" he said.

Meanwhile, locals alleged that the bridge had been shaking and even giving out strange noises — directing to the wear and tear of over 100 years.

Guardian minister Prakash Mehta, who inspected the search operations on Wednesday morning, denied commenting on the assumptions drawn by the PWD. ""The reason for the collapse will undoubtedly probed. However, now is not the time for this, the priority is on searching and locating the bodies,"" he said.","Fri, 05 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2016/08/05/488574-mahad2.jpg,"['officers', 'water', 'pressure', 'collapse', 'pillars', 'team', 'inspected', 'raging', 'bridge', 'river', 'pwd', 'arch', 'collapsed']",

Place: Holey Artisan Bakery. Inside the premises, 20 guests, most of them foreigners, are lying dead. Outside, military personnel are preparing for the final push to end the hostage standoff.

In such a chilling situation, Nibras Islam later known to be the leader among the five café attackers looked calm and preached sermon on what, he thought, Islam does allow and forbid to assistant chef Delwar Hossain and eight other staff of the restaurant.

The staff broke open the door of a bathroom a few minutes ago as they were suffocating inside following hours of confinement.

They had taken refuge in the bathroom as the militants with arms launched an attack around 8:40pm the day before. Finding this out around 2:30am, the attackers had them come out and then asked them to move in only to lock the bathroom door from outside.

Delwar, as he remembers, was trembling with fear as he would die anytime if Nibras pulled the trigger of his loaded gun.

""Don't fear. We will not kill you. Listen to me,"" Delwar quoted Nibras as saying.

The mission was to kill foreigners as they are enemies of Islam and destroy Islamic culture, the attacker said, referring to some verses from Quran.

Delwar at first didn't understand what Nibras was talking about but figured out what he meant when he started speaking about politics.

""You never cast vote in any election. This is haram,"" Nibras said.

Giving a pause, he continued, ""Never vote for the Awami League and the BNP.""

The assistant chef recalled they had all agreed to do what the cold-blooded killer advised. Sometimes they shook their heads up and down, sometimes they said yes in a muted voice.

The sermon lasted for around half an hour, said Delwar who identified Nibras when The Daily Star showed him photographs of the Gulshan cafe attackers.

Aged 22, Nibras, who along with four other assailants carried out the unprecedented massacre in Bangladesh, had gone to the North South University and the Monash University (Malaysia campus).

US-based Site Intelligence that monitors jihadi activities posted photos of the five youths holding guns, saying the images were released by the Islamic State, a global terror outfit fighting for establishing Caliphate where democracy has no place.

One of the nine militants killed in July 26 operation by law enforcers in the capital's Kalyanpur also spoke against democracy in his recorded statements.

Shazad Rouf Orko, 24, gave his entire statement against his family, his father Towhid Rouf and those who “support Sheikh Hasina” and do not support Sharia Law.

He said he gave everything up for jihad.

Citing a holy verse to justify his action, Shazad said, “Either you kill [us] or get killed, paradise is for us.”

“You guys support Sheikh Hasina … you support democracy… that is why I am happy to call my family all murtads... all kafirs [atheists]. So, repent… before it's too late so that you can be saved,” he said in English in his speech recorded before he along with other militants was killed.

The IS hasn't yet claimed to have any link to the Kalyanpur militants.

But Rakibul Hasan Reagan detained by police during the raid on the militants' den pledged allegiance to the IS.

His claim and belongings of the militants -- IS flags inscribed with “Allahu Akbar” in Arabic letters, black robes and red and white chequered keffiyeh -- seized from the flat where they had been living brought to the fore the issue of the IS presence in Bangladesh.

After the operation, Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner Asaduzzaman Mia at a press conference said the militants killed in Kalyanpur and the Gulshan café attackers might belong to the same group.

The dresses and backpacks found in the raid were similar to those used by the Gulshan attackers, he said, adding that even handkerchiefs that law enforcers had found in the house were similar to those recovered from the Gulshan cafe.

The IS in the latest issue of its online magazine Dabiq claimed that the café attackers were “inghimasi soldiers of Caliphate”.

Inghimasi is roughly translated as suicide fighter, according to jihadology.net, a clearinghouse of jihadi primary source material, original analysis and translation service.

In Dabiq, nothing was written about the Kalyanpur militants who were killed before they could cause any harm.","Wed, 03 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/nibras_islam.jpg?itok=fG0HsNpF,"['attackers', 'democracy', 'gulshan', 'kalyanpur', 'kill', 'loathed', 'islam', 'killed', 'support', 'militants', 'nibras']",

The Mekong River Commission’s secretariat in Phnom Penh – one of two for the group, charged with managing the river’s sustainable development – is being shuttered in favour of a single office in Vientiane, a decision that has provoked widespread concern among current and former MRC employees alike.

News of the move, first heard by many at the MRC offices yesterday, was delivered during a Monday speech by Prime Minister Hun Sen upon his return from accepting a “lifetime achievement” award in the Lao capital.

“We have been pulling the crab’s shell, meaning that there are two sections [offices] in Cambodia and two in Laos, therefore we are pleased to hand over to Laos to take control, but we will keep the [MRC’s] centre for flood management,” the premier said.

Hun Sen went on to frame the decision as a trade-off of sorts, saying that while the MRC offices would be closing, Cambodia had gained an ASEAN demining centre to be located in the capital.

“Cambodia gained support from our ASEAN friends to settle [the Regional Mine Action Centre] in Phnom Penh,” he said.

In a statement provided to the Post yesterday, the MRC secretariat in Vientiane said the move, described as a Cambodian proposal, was all but official.

“Over the past few months, the MRC member countries have been discussing the possibility of consolidating the two main offices into one. At this point the Lao government is considering Cambodia’s proposal to have only one main Secretariat office in Vientiane, Lao PDR and a decision is expected within the next few months. The Lao government is likely to accept Cambodia’s proposal,” the statement reads.

While the MRC’s office of flood management and mitigation will remain in the country, the looming closure of the secretariat, which employs 29 people, yesterday provoked deep consternation among current employees.

A member of the team’s support staff speaking on condition of anonymity said that employees had still not been formally informed of the decision as of yesterday. “We still have no official letter from the headquarters yet,” they said. “It was on television; my friend sent it to me on Facebook.

“We are not happy, not only me, all of our staff, [as] this information affects the general support staff”, which is entirely Cambodian, they continued, adding that employees had held an impromptu meeting about the matter yesterday to express their displeasure. Some, they said, have begun looking for new jobs.

The decision comes amid an ongoing restructuring of the four-country MRC – Vietnam and Thailand are the other two members – that was initiated in 2010 in a bid to make the body financially self-sustaining.

Since then, much of the river-basin management – particularly as it relates to tributaries of the Mekong – has fallen out of the MRC’s purview and into that of individual governments.

The MRC has previously been strongly criticised by current and former employees for being weak and ineffectual at a time when the river system is in dire need of protection and sustainable management.

Ian Thomas, a former technical adviser for drought at the MRC, yesterday expressed concern over the move.

“The Mekong River is too important for Cambodia to give up the MRC [to] Laos,” he said. “Why? When we see thousands of irrigation dams popping up in Thailand, the Don Sahong in Laos and have the biggest inland fishery in the world under threat and a third of the Tonle Sap’s swamp forests [going] up in flames.

“We’re in the most important inland fishery in the word and we’re running out of fish; it’s ridiculous,” he said.

With the secretariat solely in Laos, home to one of the most controversial dam projects on the Mekong, the MRC may find itself in a situation similar to the 1990s, when critics say the body’s CEO was forced to resign for pushing back against Thai projects when the secretariat was based in Thailand.

What’s more, “Laos is the least cooperative country in the MRC,” Thomas added.

90,90,FL-2016-000075-BGD,Bilding is a faceted wooden community centre built by students - Dezeen,https://www.dezeen.com/2016/07/30/bilding-faceted-wooden-pavilion-community-centre-students-university-of-innsbruck-rapoldi-park-austria/,"Architecture students from the University of Innsbruck have designed and built an angular timber and glass structure to provide a place for youngsters in the Austrian city to develop creative skills (+ slideshow).

The Bilding pavilion is located in Innsbruck's Rapoldi Park, on a plot provided by the city council.

Devised by a voluntary group connected to local architecture organisation Aut Architektur und Tirol, the project aims to encourage those aged from four to 19 to explore their artistic interests and talents.

Students from the university's Studio3 Institute for Experimental Architecture submitted 17 proposals for the structure as their bachelor theses, and from these a design by Niklas Nalbach was chosen by a supervisory panel.

""This project was chosen because of its openness and spatial continuum, with no rooms and no endings,"" said Verena Rauch, a tutor on the Studio3 course.

""It creates a sense of being embedded in the park, with landscape inside and outside.""

The building features a glued timber-laminate framework resting on point-bearing concrete foundations. Its folded external surfaces are clad in white polymer sheets that are seamlessly welded to form a waterproof membrane.

Walls, floors and ceilings are formed from sheets of spruce wood that are left exposed to create a homogenous interior with a natural feel that references Bilding's wooded setting.

""The wooden structure creates a link to the park and forms an inviting place,"" Rauch told Dezeen.

""The building opens up towards the Rapoldi Park and presents life and a creative and positive environment to a place that used to be a roughed-up skate park.""

The angled surfaces give way in places to full-height glazing that allows natural light and views to flood into the interior.

Glazed internal walls ensure the light and views are not interrupted.

One entirely transparent facade looks onto an external timber deck flanked by trees on its other side, while skylights incorporated in the ceilings help to bring light into the central communal area.

A projecting canopy marks the main entrance. It is supported on one side by a wall punctuated with openings, which maintain a visual connection with the building's surroundings.

Various architects, structural engineers, planners and suppliers provided their expertise to help develop the project and prepare it for construction. Twenty-seven students were then involved in building the pavilion over a five-month period starting in April 2015.

The building hosts workshops and classes related to creative disciplines, including painting, sculpture, architecture, fashion and digital media.

Its internal spaces are intended to encourage children to draw and paint whilst relaxing on the untreated wooden surfaces, which will gradually display the marks of the activities taking place within them.

""The experimental space invites everybody to enter, play, and work with the structure."" Rauch added.

""It has no barriers, as it is open and free to all the people passing by. Within time the Bilding will get a lot of tracks, which we very much appreciate, as we see architecture as work in progress.""

It only took one day into the 2016 Olympic games for the first China-related controversy to unfold.

Last Saturday, Australian swimmer Mack Horton called his Chinese opponent Sun Yang a “drug cheat” in reference to a 2014 doping suspension, shortly before narrowly beating him for the 400-meter freestyle gold medal. After the race, a tearful Sun accused Horton of playing mind games: ""On the Olympics' competition stage, every athlete deserves to be respected and there's no need to use these cheap tricks to affect each other.""

The reaction from China was similarly swift. Commenters posted a flood of angry remarks on Horton’s social media accounts, and Chinese media condemned the athlete. China’s swim team manager invoked a frequently used phrase for responding to foreign criticism, saying that Horton “hurt the feelings” of the Chinese swimmers.

Such reactions to fairly standard trash talk may strike some as thin-skinned. But to many Chinese people, slights like Horton’s can evoke strong connections to a historic “humiliation” narrative pushed in schools, museums, and media — one in which Westerners look down upon China, insult it, and conspire to keep it down.

The Olympics provide a particularly ripe venue for these incidents.

At the 2012 London games, an American commentator called a 16-year-old Chinese swimmer’s world-record performance “suspicious” and “disturbing” for how fast it was. Soon thereafter, an article in China’s official Xinhua News Agency quoted a sports official claiming that the Americans “cannot accept China’s rise. That’s why they criticize Chinese athletes.”

At the same games, several upsets and disqualifications that cost Chinese athletes gold medals were attributed to Western conspiracies — supposedly borne out of a “hysterical” and “paranoid” fear of China, according to the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily. (These claims were never substantiated).

Perhaps the most significant outpouring of indignation came in the run-up to the 2008 Beijing games, when the worldwide Olympic torch relay was disrupted by protesters in London, Paris, and San Francisco and led to boycotts of French companies in China. At one protest outside the French retailer Carrefour in the city of Qingdao, protesters directly linked historic and modern issues when they toted signs saying, “Say No to Carrefour! Say No to French Imperialists! Strongly Protest Britain and France Invading China in 1860! Strongly Protest [Britain and France] Slandering Our Olympics in 2008!”

The below video, made by a Chinese college student, went viral and captured the mood at the time. “Imperialism will never abandon its intention to destroy us!” it says to chilling music, adding that China’s torch relay struggle is “just like the long march for [China’s] rise from a semi-colony up to a modern independent country.”

To understand this enduring sentiment, one has to understand the “Century of Humiliation” narrative that has become a cornerstone of China’s national identity. The narrative goes like this: China was once a great world power and glorious peace-loving civilization, until foreign aggressors in Europe, the United States, and Japan — starting with the British and the First Opium War in 1839 — brought the country to its knees through a century of brutal conquest and forced territorial concessions.

Though a similar “national humiliation” grievance existed under China’s Kuomintang government in the 1920s and 1930s, it was abandoned by Mao Zedong following his assumption of power in 1949 in favor of a storyline that stressed socialist triumphalism and proletarian internationalism. But the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the domino collapse of communist states over the next few years illustrated that that approach had run out of steam, so the Communist Party shifted its focus back to a nationalistic victimhood narrative wherein it played the role of savior. According to this narrative, it wasn’t until the Japanese army was defeated in 1945 and the Communist Party prevailed in China’s civil war in 1949 that the country was set on a path toward national “rejuvenation.”

Olympic glory has been framed — implicitly and explicitly — as one important indicator of this rejuvenation. As early as 1903, a sort of national insecurity was already developing when Chinese scholar Chen Tianhua translated an article written by a British man referring to China as “the sick man of East Asia.” The article, intended as a political critique of the Qing government’s stagnation, was interpreted by Chen in part as an attack on the physical weakness of Chinese people. “Shame! Shame! Shame!,” Chen wrote in response. “This great China, which for many centuries was hailed as the Celestial Empire by neighbors, is now reduced to a fourth rate nation! The foreigners call us the sick man of East Asia, call us a barbaric, inferior race.”

China only sent athletes to the Olympics four times up to 1952 — winning no medals — and then went on a three decade hiatus during the international isolation of the Mao era. But after winning its first gold at the 1984 Los Angeles games, the stage was set for the Olympics to symbolize something much more to China than athletic competition.

At the turn of this century, this sentiment was formalized when a cabinet-approved government document called on different ministries and provincial governments to cooperate for the purpose of “winning honor” at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics. In 2004, the website of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games published an article titled “From ‘Sick man of East Asia’ to ‘Sports Big Power,’” which invoked a cartoon published in a foreign newspaper that supposedly mocked China’s early Olympic failures. “This is a humiliation and satire of the Chinese athletes but also indicates that the disaster-ridden old China has no status in the world,” it read.

In his book Never Forget National Humiliation, Professor Wang Zheng of Seton Hall University explains how Beijing's extravagant hosting of the 2008 Olympics and its record medal haul (China bested the United States for the first time ever) played into this narrative:

“It is because of the lingering memory of national humiliation that the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) elite can legitimize their rule through sports. Gold medals in international sports have been effectively used as the currency of CCP legitimacy. Comparing today’s achievements with that of old China, as in the article “From ‘Sick Man of East Asia’ to ‘Sports Big Power,’” has been a common method of the CCP propaganda machine. It is a great achievement for China to go from just one participant and no medals in 1932 to 100 medals and 51 golds in 2008. The success of the CCP government and China’s rejuvenation in power and wealth can be illustrated by the world-leading count of 51 gold medals.”

However, many international observers criticized China’s human rights record rather than stand in awe of the country’s progress and achievements, playing directly into the historical narrative of arrogant Westerners conspiring to keep China from its rightful place as a respected world power. Many Chinese took it as a slap in the face. In a 2008 interview, Paul A. Cohen, a professor of history emeritus at Wellesley College, described this as part of an “uneasy relationship in China today between pride and insecurity, so conspicuously embodied in the importance many Chinese attached to the Olympics.”

In many Chinese eyes, a national “rejuvenation” necessitated the validation and approval of the very powers that had originally knocked the country off its perch. Cohen described this as a “quest — almost a yearning — for the admiration and respect of the rest of the world, above all the Western world.” He added: “If the approval isn’t granted or is granted only with qualifications, initial pride can suddenly morph into resentment, anger, and deepened insecurity.”

While comments like Mack Horton’s would likely draw anger from any nation whose athlete was subjected to such insult, this historical “insecurity” might explain why grievances so frequently involve slights toward Chinese competitors. These incidents once again play right into the idea that Westerners look down upon China and will do whatever they can to undermine its achievements. In a 2008 interview with Asia Society’s Orville Schell, Chinese filmmaker Chen Shi-Zheng, whose work has explored psychological dynamics between China and the West, put it this way:","Tue, 09 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://asiasociety.org/sites/default/files/styles/1200w/public/160807_olympics.jpg,"['olympics', 'humiliation', 'history', 'chinas', 'power', '2008', 'games', 'asia', 'hurt', 'olympic', 'feelings', 'chinese', 'china', 'national']",

But in recent years, as the value of wetlands has been better understood, the trend has been moving in the opposite direction, with increasing protection for coastal zones and efforts to restore wetlands to their natural state.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Tyee Builders Zoom Past Member Drive Goal In just 11 days, over 500 readers signed up to give monthly. Thank you! Now we’re upping the ante.

But this is not so in China, where rapid growth of both the economy and the population, especially along the coasts, has led to coastal reclamation projects on a massive scale.

Earlier this year, a team of researchers published the results of a satellite survey that tracked changes in China’s coastline between 1985 and 2010. They found that in this period, nearly 7,700 square kilometers of coastal wetlands—about the size of Delaware and Rhode Island combined—were lost to land reclamation projects.

“They’re completely industrializing the coastal ecosystem,” says Chip Fletcher, a coastal geologist at the University of Hawai‘i who was not involved in the research. “The problems China is experiencing are typical of other places in the world, but it’s taking it to a whole new level.”

Bo Tian, a geographer at East China Normal University and lead author on the study, says the paper grew out of his team’s examination of changes in China’s coastal wetlands, and the recognition that land reclamation was a key driver.

THE TYEE IS A FAN OF HAKAI MAGAZINE Victoria-based Hakai Magazine, part of the Tula Foundation and Hakai Institute family, is an online magazine publishing fascinating articles about coastal science and societies globally. The information and storytelling are top-notch (the accompanying article was first published there). We strongly encourage you to visit Hakai Magazine here.

China’s economy has grown rapidly since 1985, with much of its urbanization and industrialization concentrated in coastal regions. Over the past decade, local governments have been especially active in promoting economic growth through the expansion of coastal industries, leading to increased demand for land, writes Bo and his colleagues in their report. The pace of coastal reclamation began to accelerate even further around 2005 as the economy’s boom swiftened. China’s strict laws protecting arable farmland from development only add to the pressures to reclaim coastal wetlands for industrialization.

The coastal transformation could result in potentially serious environmental consequences for China. In addition to habitat loss for birds and coastal wildlife, wetlands provide valuable ecosystem services, including coastal protection from extreme events such as tsunamis, hurricanes, and storm surges; erosion control; and carbon sequestration, says Bo.

The magnitude of those impacts make it surprising that the Chinese government would support reclamation projects on such a large scale, Fletcher says. “The Chinese appear to be bent on creating new coastal land because of the growth of their coastal population, and are not too worried about the loss of ecosystem services in the process,” he says.

While the development isn’t expected to have a direct environmental effect outside of China, the massive reclamation work could be of global significance within the coming century, Fletcher adds. While low-lying reclaimed lands might initially absorb some of China’s population growth, rising sea levels could mean that they ultimately contribute to a worldwide flood of climate refugees.

“These are lands,” Fletcher says, “that are going to have to be abandoned.”

TorrentFreak, a publication that brings news about copyright, privacy, and filesharing, reported the meta-search engine, which hosted no torrents of its own but linked to other sites including The Pirate Bay, has decided to cease its operation. The surprise shutdown marks the end of an era. Founded in 2003, Torrentz has been a stable factor in the torrent community for over 13 years. With millions of visitors per day the site grew out to become one of the most visited torrent sites, but today this reign ends, as the popular meta-search engine has announced its shutdown. A few hours ago and without warning, Torrentz disabled its search functionality. At first sight the main page looks normal but those who try to find links to torrents will notice that they’re no longer there. Instead, the site is now referring to itself in the past tense, suggesting that after more than a decade the end has arrived. “Torrentz was a free, fast and powerful meta-search engine combining results from dozens of search engines,” the text reads. The site’s user are no longer able to login either. Instead, they see the following message: “Torrentz will always love you. Farewell.” TorrentFreak was contacted by the operator of Torrentz, who prefers not to comment at the moment. It’s clear, however, that another major torrent site is shutting down, leaving a gaping hole. Torrentz itself never hosted any torrent files but did have a takedown procedure in place, allowing copyright holders to take down infringing links. Not all rightsholders were happy with the site though. Both RIAA and MPAA have reported the site to the U.S. Government in recent years, which repeatedly placed it its annual “Out-of-Cycle Review of Notorious Markets.” With Torrentz.eu and KickassTorrents both shutting down, the torrent comunity lost two of the largest sites in a period of three weeks. This means that millions of users will have to find new homes. Founded a few weeks before The Pirate Bay, Torrentz was one of the oldest torrent sites still around.

One more was recently added to the population, bringing up the tally to 24 with 11 males, 11 female and two infants.

According to zoo officials, a baby macaque was born to Vimala (9) and her partner Ravi (9) on July 8 at the zoo. However, the sex of the newborn can be determined only later. Earlier in April this year, two other monkeys were born in captivity in the same enclosure.

This endangered species has been breeding successfully at the zoo, as a result of which the Central Zoo Authority of India has declared Vandalur zoo a coordinating zoo for the Lion-Tailed Macaque Conservation Breeding programme.

Apart from an enclosure with a moat, the animals are housed in two other breeding centres, located on the zoo premises, which are closed to the public. A male and three female macaques were secured from Valparai in 1990, and in 1999 one more female was added to the population.

The in-house breeding facility has successfully added over 50 newborns to the population at the zoo, so far, and they have been exchanged with other zoos in Guwahati, Shimla, Delhi, Thiruvananthapuram, Mysuru, Hyderabad and Baroda, for other species of animals or birds.

In order to keep the primates active, the zoo has installed swings, hammocks, poles, ladders and also grass patches, as they feed on insects.

You’ll experience the adrenaline rush of a lifetime, for one. But you’ll also hear the urgent commands of flight attendants telling you to leave your bags behind. Yes, all of them. Laptops and purses, too.

Maybe the adrenaline is causing temporary deafness. Materialism has been winning out over self-preservation as air travelers often ignore the order to drop everything, a fact illustrated in recent years by laden passengers fleeing a burning 777 in San Francisco or a Delta Air Lines Inc. jet that skidded off a snowy New York runway. The latest example came on Wednesday, when an Emirates Airline flight crashed on landing in Dubai, followed by a severe fire that consumed much of the Boeing 777-300. Video showed some travelers collecting luggage before they escaped. All 282 passengers and 18 crew survived, but an airport firefighter died while battling the blaze.

The scramble for luggage makes flight attendants, pilots, and safety experts apoplectic. What many passengers fail to realize is that pausing to pull out a bag endangers not only them, but everyone behind them. U.S. regulators require that aircraft be evacuated in 90 seconds in an emergency, a standard that’s taken hold across most of the globe. Some airlines have also incorporated the notice about discarding belongings into the preflight safety briefing passengers receive.

Yet, despite the shock from a crash or skid or cabin smoke and the looming potential for fire, bags remain a powerful lure, seen by some as too precious to leave.

“Flight attendants have said they have had to physically grab bags from people and throw them into the galley to get them away from the evacuation,” said Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA. “There’s a lot of problems with those bags.”

One of the most dangerous arises from bottlenecks that occur while flight attendants manage “flow control.” This includes helping passengers jump into the emergency slide correctly, said Michael Massoni, operational safety chairperson for the Transport Workers Union Local 556 and a flight attendant for Southwest Airlines Co. “There’s all kinds of potential for nonsense if there are a lot of bags.”

In the worst scenarios, some of that nonsense can end with injury or death.

Putting more bags into cargo holds could lessen the problem, but airlines want to decrease the load of each plane to save on fuel, and passengers don’t want to pay those fees or leave things at home. It turns out that, for both passengers and airlines, when it’s your money or your life, money wins.

Is there a regulatory fix? Fines or prosecution of crash survivors? Overhead bins the crew can lock if an emergency is declared? Any potential remedy comes with an array of potential problems, from costs, to legal issues, to operational glitches. Some bins, for example, hold items a flight attendant might need in an emergency.

The possibility of a huge fine “would stick in their mind” and cause passengers to leave their bags as directed, Nelson said. Yet flyers may simply assume those rules are unenforceable unless busy emergency personnel on the ground helped enforce them. “In the chaos of an evacuation, where you’re trying to get everyone off an airplane in 90 seconds, you’re going to have a hard time identifying who had the briefcase, who had the big bag, and they didn’t follow my order,” Massoni said.

A study on emergency evacuations in 2000 by the National Transportation Safety Board found that almost 50 percent of people in an evacuation had tried to take a bag. The report examined 46 aircraft evacuations and included surveys of passengers and flight attendants on those flights. Two-thirds of the 36 flight attendants who responded said that carry-on bags were an obstruction during the evacuation. The main reasons passengers gave for grabbing their bags was money, wallets, or credit cards, followed by work materials, keys and medication.

“Although not everyone attempts to retrieve and take carry-on baggage during an evacuation, everyone in the airplane could potentially be affected by these attempts,” the study noted.

To date, the Federal Aviation Administration has not pursued civil penalties against anyone who has taken luggage during an evacuation in violation of crew instructions. “I think we could pursue a penalty if failure to obey a crew member’s instruction resulted in a significant safety issue—such as blocking an exit so other passengers could not get out in a timely way,” FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said in an e-mail.

Nelson, the flight attendants association chief, is a 20-year veteran who works at United Continental Holdings Inc. She likens the bag-evacuation issue to smoking on an aircraft, which the FAA banned in 1990. Without stiff sanctions, people will continue to grab bags despite flight attendants’ entreaties. Today, both smoking on board and tampering with aircraft smoke detectors invite federal prosecution and steep fines.

“Smoking is not allowed because it can jeopardize the lives and the health of other passengers and the lives and health of the crew,” she said. “And carrying your bag could have the same consequence.”

Chief Executive Officer Tom Wilson created a stand-alone unit for a telematics business that he expects to grow rapidly by collecting data on drivers and selling analytics products to third parties.

The firm is named Arity and will also serve the insurer’s own brands including Esurance, Wilson said Wednesday in a phone interview. Allstate, the largest publicly traded U.S. provider of home and auto coverage, has been using telematics for at least six years to help clients drive safely and obtain rewards.

Arity can “incorporate new data sources and enhance analytical capabilities in ways that we weren’t able to do when it was embedded in the insurance company,” Wilson said. “It’s a big enough platform today with the Allstate customers in it, and that will continue to grow, but we’d like it to grow even faster with a broader set of customers.”

Allstate rival Progressive Corp. has used technology for years to track driver habits and offer discounts to its safest clients. The approach has gained appeal in other sectors. Verizon Communications Inc. agreed this week to spend $2.4 billion to buy a GPS vehicle-tracking company.

Wilson has been seeking to offset pressured margins at the car insurance business. The Northbrook, Illinois-based company announced Wednesday that second-quarter net income slipped to $271 million, or 64 cents a share, from $355 million, or 79 cents, a year earlier. Wilson said the telematics business has tripled over the past three years.

“We’ve reached a million late last year in terms of active connections, and we expect it to grow quite aggressively,” he said. “It’s a good growth business which is one of the reasons we wanted to make sure it wasn’t restricted by the efforts of being inside an insurance company.”
