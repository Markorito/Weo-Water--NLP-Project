0,0,FL-2012-000100-CHN,The Inside Story of When China's State-Run TV Criticized the Party - The Atlantic,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/06/the-inside-story-of-when-chinas-state-run-tv-criticized-the-party/258102/,"Xia continued, with a jaded smile on his face, ""Obviously I was completely marginalized at CCTV after that, but luckily my skill and expertise were valued by other organizations so I became a floating independent producer. From 1990 to 1995, I spent five years wandering around China's rural areas, exploring topics of my own choice. I made a documentary about China's peasants in 1992 and then another six-part, two-hundred-minute one called East, which is an anatomy of ancient civilization in Asia. The documentary was never released.""

Xia returned to CCTV in 1995, answering Yang Weiguang's call to help initiate the fledgling News Probe.

""Many things had changed during my five years in exile. I returned to a different CCTV, now housing celebrated shows such as Oriental Horizon and Focus. Reform and opening up had brought changes to CCTV. And I was a changed person as well. When I made River at twenty-six, I knew little about the real world. I did not have a real in-depth understanding of the many issues facing China. My years wandering around China's countryside transformed me. I experienced the real China and realized that there was a gap between my abstract notion of Chinese tradition and how the tradition is lived through real Chinese people.""

He would work at CCTV for four years before leaving for Beijing TV.

""China is at a very awkward stage,"" said Xia. ""I don't think intellectuals fully comprehend the level of China's dilemma. Urbanization and industrialization have unleashed a hard-to-tame desire for a more materialistically enriched life, resulting in vast disruption to life's natural balance and equilibrium.""

It is interesting to see how Xia has moved from the position of a radical Occidentalist to someone with a self-professed understanding of the logic of China's agrarian-based civilization.

Xia left CCTV in 2000 to experiment with running a lifestyle channel leased from Beijing TV as a private contractor, an opportunity that gave him the freedom to run his own media entity. He emphasized that his freedom was worth the price of losing CCTV as a major platform. He reminded me that his former CCTV colleagues have little moral or professional control working for CCTV.

When I relayed this to Chen Xiaoqing, CCTV's director of documentary programs, there was a touch of sarcasm in his response: ""I hope so, though probably not. I feel that the old Xia's spirit has actually been straitjacketed today. His trademark sharpness and precision are all gone now. He caters more than he had to before. You have to cater [to sponsors] if you want to do projects. There is no way out. The difference is that instead of serving the party-state, you're now at the mercy of money. Perhaps we all need to find places that are right for us as individuals.""

Perhaps this was an overly harsh assessment of Xia's recent career move, but like Xia, Chen is not someone who minces words. Chen is a man in his mid 40s, a decade younger than most other middle managers at his level. In 1989, after completing his master's degree, Chen joined CCTV's Local 30 Minutes, a curated program that showcased local documentary productions or productions about local events. In 1991, he was sent to report on flood-control efforts in southern China. There he shot The Story of a Lonely Island on location. The film became China's official documentary entry at that year's Cannes TV Festival. Encouraged by the success, Chen started to toy with the idea of making an independent documentary about migrant workers from his hometown who worked as nannies in big cities.","Tue, 05 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/static/b/theatlantic/img/lacroix-default-thumbnail.png,"['party', 'tv', 'criticized', 'wandering', 'real', 'xias', 'xia', 'chinas', 'documentary', 'local', 'chen', 'china', 'inside', 'cctv', 'staterun']", 
1,1,FL-2012-000100-CHN,Safety scandals give foreign dairies a boost in China - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-dairy-foreign-idUSBRE85H0M720120618,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Global food and dairy companies are making another round of big bets on China’s fast growing dairy sector, seeking to position themselves as safe alternatives after a lethal baby formula scandal burned the industry four years ago.

They are lured by projections of 10 percent annual growth for the sector and by Chinese consumers’ willingness to pay a premium for foreign brands as they remain wary of local brands’ safety records.

Just last week, China’s top-selling dairy firm Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Co recalled six months’ worth of one brand of infant formula after government tests found it was tainted with mercury, a heavy metal that can cause neural damage if ingested.

The news has sent Yili’s stock sliding 14 percent over the last two days to trade at 20.8 yuan a share.

The latest foreign bet comes from Danish-Swedish dairy group Arla, which said on Friday it would buy what amounts to a 6 percent stake in Yili’s main competitor, China Mengniu Dairy Co, from private equity fund Hopu for 1.7 billion Danish crowns ($289 million). The deal lifted Mengniu shares by 7 percent on Monday.

“If you have an international brand, then there’s a premium in the market, because food safety is a concern,” said Kevin Bellamy, dairy analyst at Rabobank in the Netherlands.

For some global milk producers, finding new markets is also crucial as they consolidate and expand production faster than their traditional, and mature, milk markets can grow.

Milk and formula safety became a deep concern for Chinese parents after a 2008 scandal in which at least six babies died and 300,000 were sickened from drinking milk formula contaminated with melamine, a chemical used in fertilizer and plastic.

But investing in China can mean reputational risk for international dairy firms. In 2008 Arla, which already has a formula joint venture with Mengniu, had to reassure its international customers that it did not sell Chinese-produced products elsewhere, after production at the Chinese plant was temporarily suspended due to the melamine scandal.

In addition, Mengniu last year destroyed milk tainted with aflatoxin, a carcinogenic mould found in corn grown in humid climates.

“To be a minority shareholder in a food company in China, regardless of the quality of your partner, you’re still exposed to the supply chain,” said dairy consultant David Mahon, head of Mahon China Investment Management, referring to the Arla/Mengnui deal.

“The lesson from melamine would not have been learned, and that would be a pity.”

PRIVATE EQUITY

China is the world’s largest formula market and is expected to overtake the United States as the largest dairy market by 2020.

Private equity firms Hopu, KKR & Co L.P. and Carlyle Group all took stakes in China dairy companies between 2008 and 2009.

Hopu is winding down its fund, and exited as the lockup on its investment expired, but KKR and Carlyle have invested in technology and production systems to bring Western style milk production to China dairy firms, including importing cows.

Private equity funds typically exit their investments after three to five years, and Carlyle and KKR will hope to attract Western strategic buyers for their respective stakes.

KKR has 24 percent of China Modern Dairy valued at about $266 million, while Carlyle has 24 percent of Yashili worth around $130 million. China Modern Dairy provides milk for the Shanghai market while Yashili supplies the wealthy Pearl River Delta.

Among more recent private equity investments in the sector, Olympus Capital led a consortium to buy a significant minority stake in Huaxia Dairy Farm Ltd in mid-2011 for $45 million, providing expansion capital and bringing in a European strategic investor, Mueller Milch, for one of China’s largest single dairy farms.

SUPPLY CHAINS

To keep up with growth, multinational dairy firms are looking to expand their production in China, but are taking pains to guard against quality problems, particularly the need to control the supply chain for raw milk.

Nestle’s sales in China are about to expand significantly, pending approval by the commerce ministry to incorporate the China operations of Pfizer Inc, which would boost its market share in infant formula to 12 percent. The Swiss food giant agreed in April to buy Pfizer’s infant formula division for $11.9 billion.

Greater China accounted for only 3 percent of Nestle’s global sales in 2011, but sales in the region grew by 23 percent last year.

Nestle buys milk directly from thousands of small dairy farmers in the flat green fields of northeast China. But it has already cut its small suppliers from nearly 30,000 to under 12,000, and plans to rehouse the rest in big dairy bases.

This month it broke ground on a $377 million project with U.S. dairy and feed cooperative Land O’Lakes and other partners. It will house a training center and two huge modern dairy farms, one with 2,400 cows, the other with 8,000.

“The farmers are moving into the cities, the system is getting consolidated, so we are moving towards more middle-to large-sized farms,” Nestle’s China chief executive Roland Decorvet told Reuters at the ground-breaking in Shuangcheng, near the northeastern city of Harbin.

New Zealand dairy cooperative Fonterra, which sells $2 billion a year of imported milk products in China, is also building large dairy bases near Beijing, the milk from which it sells at a premium to other dairies.

In 2008, Fonterra lost almost all its $150 million investment in Sanlu Group, the state-owned Chinese dairy at the heart of the melamine scandal.

COMING FLOOD

Another driving force for foreign firms to ramp up their presence in China is a coming surplus of milk in Europe.

The expiration in 2015 of national production caps in the European Union is expected to lead to a 6 percent jump in European milk production, bringing an additional 9 billion liters a year onto the market, said Bellamy of Rabobank.

“They could supply more to European cheese, but that’s pretty saturated. The Asian and Chinese markets are very attractive because of the percentage of growth we are seeing,” he said.

With its latest investment, Arla estimates its turnover in China will grow five-fold by 2016, from $119 million in 2011.

“It will contribute positively to our cooperative owners’ milk price from day one, as we are able to add more value to milk that we otherwise would have to sell on the global bulk trading market, where the profit is lower historically,” Arla Foods CEO Peder Tuborgh said in a statement.

Rainfall totals varied greatly in the region, from one inch to nearly 22 inches

Roads, bridges and structures -- including a county jail -- are affected, officials say

Flash flood watches are in effect for parts of Florida, Alabama and Mississippi

Parts of the Florida Panhandle and coastal Alabama were under water Sunday, with an onslaught of torrential rains causing not just extensive flooding but also damage to roads and buildings, local officials said.

More than 20 inches of rain have fallen over the past 24 hours in spots in Escambia County, the county's emergency management director John Dosh told CNN around noon Sunday.

The National Weather Service, in fact, noted a wide range of rainfall totals around the region through 8 a.m. Sunday. Though some coastal spots such as Destin, Florida, received around an inch, others had much more -- including between five and 10 inches in parts of Mobile, Alabama, and 21.7 inches in West Pensacola, Florida.

The precipitation contributed to a host of problems, with flooding especially substantial in the southern part of Escambia County along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, according to Dosh.

Some 113 people are in shelters in Escambia County due to the storm, and residents of a low-lying apartment complex were ordered to evacuate, the spokesman added. But there have been no related fatalities or injuries.

Cars attempt to navigate high water Sunday in Escambia County, Florida.

Additionally, several roads and bridges, as well as a number of homes and businesses, have suffered damage, said Dosh.

One of the structures affected is the Escambia County Jail in Pensacola. The facility's central booking facility, where inmates are brought in, was under about six feet of water at midday Saturday, according to Escambia County Sheriff's Office spokesman Mike Ward.

The main part of the jail, which houses 697 inmates, lost power in the storm, said Ward. But temporary power has been brought in, and efforts continue to get the air conditioning back working. The spokesman said security at the jail was never compromised.

Flash flooding made parts of some roadways impassable, with some reporting waters rising more than six feet in spots.

Leroy Bonifay, 90, told CNN affiliate WALA that he and his grandson got stuck along Airport Boulevard in Pensacola when water ""washed up over my hood and drowned my engine."" It climbed even higher, up to the windows, before two bystanders came to their rescue.

""I have never seen it get this high in this area before,"" said Bonifay. ""It's tough, but we'll make it out all right.""

And the headaches aren't over, as the rain may not let up anytime soon.

The National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch through Monday morning for parts of southwest Alabama, northwest Florida and southeast Mississippi, where three to six more inches of rain are expected.

There is also ""a high risk for rip currents"" through 1 p.m. Monday off Alabama and Florida Panhandle beaches, according to the weather agency.","Mon, 11 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120611084509-von-pensacola-flooding-00001602-story-top.jpg,"['escambia', 'florida', 'damage', 'county', 'alabama', 'weather', 'parts', 'water', 'high', 'rains', 'cause', 'panhandle', 'inches', 'jail', 'flooding', 'torrential']", 
4,4,FL-2012-000100-CHN,Louis Mackay | Tintin in China · LRB 11 June 2012 - London Review of Books,https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2012/june/tintin-in-china,"In his recent piece on Hergé in the LRB, Christopher Tayler notes the influence on Tintin’s creator of a Chinese artist, Zhang Chongren, whom he met in 1934, as he was starting work on The Blue Lotus. In the story, Tintin saves a Chinese boy called Chang Chong-Chen from a flood and the two become inseparable allies. Set in and around Shanghai in the early 1930s, the plot is loosely based on the Mukden Incident and the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. As well as scheming Japanese officers, the villains include an American businessman and a venal British police chief.

The book is sympathetic to the Chinese and, as Tayler says, ‘consciously satirical towards European notions of cultural superiority’. Zhang is generally credited with bringing about this change in Hergé’s attitudes, as well as with helping him develop a sense of pictorial composition that owes something to Chinese aesthetics. But Zhang also made a more direct contribution to The Blue Lotus.

When I first read the story, I was interested by the profusion of Chinese writing in signs, wall-hangings, posters, graffiti, and occasionally speech bubbles. What did they say? Or were they merely random characters included for atmospheric effect? I later learned some Chinese, and found that they were intelligible. Some characters in the larger banners may have been copied by Hergé or a studio assistant, but the smaller texts are written with such assurance that the hand must be Zhang’s. In three places his personal name 充仁 (Chongren) appears as a cryptic signature, partly obscured, on signs in the background, once next to the character 張, Zhang, his family name.

One prevalent poster is an advertisement for Siemens (西門子, ‘Xi-men-zi’), which had run factories in China since 1899. Indoors there are proverbs and shanshui poems. Political slogans aredaubed on outside walls. Some are incomplete but all would have been instantly understood by a Chinese reader. A truncated line of graffiti refers to 三民主義, the ‘Three Principles of the People’adopted by the Chinese Republic under Sun Yat-sen (national self-determination, democracy and the welfare of the people). A torn poster reads: 取消不平等... (‘Abrogate the unequal...’). Any Chinese reader would know that the final missing characters were 條約, ‘treaties’. The ‘agreements’ imposed by force after the Opium Wars, which established Western and Japanese commercial dominance in the treaty ports, with extraterritorial rights giving foreigners immunity from Chinese law, were deeply resented.

In a pivotal scene, Tintin goes to the aid of a rickshaw puller who is being beaten and abused as a ‘dirty little Chinaman’ by the villainous American businessman. A prominent poster spanning the frame carries the slogan 打倒帝國主義: ‘Smash imperialism.’

When The Blue Lotus was first published, Japan complained formally to the Belgian government. Chiang Kai-shek liked it so much, he invited Hergé to visit China. A redrawn edition was published after the war but then suppressed by the Communists. In 1984 the Beijing authorities permitted a new edition, but only after some further changes were made – not to the story, but to the Chinese background detail. Deng Xiaoping’s plans for China’s development depended on encouraging Japanese and other foreign investment. A poster that had originally said 抵制日貨 (‘Boycott Japanese goods’) became a street sign: 大吉路 (‘Great Auspiciousness Street’).

Tintin’s friend Chang reappears in Tintin in Tibet (1958), but Hergé lost touch with Zhang Chongren in the late 1930s. They finally met again in 1981. Zhang, who had become a menial labourer during the Cultural Revolution, regained his reputation as an artist in China, but spent his last years in France, where he died in 1998.","Mon, 11 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.lrb.co.uk/media/cache/social_image/var/site/storage/images/6/9/4/5/315496-1-eng-GB/dadaodiguozhuyi400.jpg,"['poster', 'chinese', '11', 'zhang', 'japanese', 'blue', 'lrb', 'tintin', 'hergé', 'china', 'chongren', 'characters']",

More rain could fall in drenched areas of the Florida Panhandle and coastal Alabama, where residents are assessing the damage from torrential rains that caused widespread flooding and millions of dollars in damage.

While not likely as devastating as the storms in recent days, more showers are likely and thunderstorms are possible through Tuesday in places like Pensacola, Florida, according to the National Weather Service. In fact, the government of Escambia County, Florida, is warning residents to expect rainy weather to continue through Friday.

Meanwhile, problems from the torrential rains that have already fallen persist in the region.

A flood warning is in effect through Tuesday morning around sections of the Bayou Sara waterway in Alabama's Mobile County. Authorities also are warning of a ""high rip current risk"" through Tuesday evening off beaches in that part of the Gulf of Mexico coast.

The area was deluged over the weekend by water that caused significant damage. Early Monday, a fresh thunderstorm dumped up to 2 inches of rain in Mobile and Baldwin counties in southwest Alabama, according to the weather service.

Rainfall totals from the spurt of storms varied considerably around the region through Monday morning, though no community escaped. West Pensacola received 23.6 inches, while Mobile, Alabama, saw between 7 and 14 inches, the weather agency reported.

Officials in Escambia County, where Pensacola is located, expect damage to total more than $20 million.

Floodwaters up to 8 feet deep inundated the Forest Creek Apartments in the city.

""I walked out chin-deep in water,"" Lillian Murphy told CNN affiliate WEAR TV . The floodwater submerged her car and almost reached the roof of her apartment. ""I don't know who to call or who to contact.""

Escambia County remains in a state of emergency. But one sign of progress Monday came when three shelters set up at area schools were closed, according to an update on the county's website. A single shelter at a Pensacola church had seven people as of late Monday afternoon.

Lightning struck a boy in Gulf Shores, Alabama, on Sunday, leaving him hospitalized in critical condition.

""As soon as the lightning bolt hit, everyone hit the ground and took off running,"" lifeguard Justin Pearce told CNN affiliate WPMI TV . ""Then we saw a person laying by the edge of the water.""

9,9,FL-2012-000100-CHN,Santa Barbara Wines: Big in Beijing - Santa Barbara Independent,https://www.independent.com/2012/06/08/santa-barbara-wines-big-beijing/,"Bottles & Barrels Santa Barbara Wines: Big in Beijing S.B. County Vintners Start Exporting Wines to China

When JiaMin Liang Dierberg was a little girl in Shanghai, no one imagined that Western indulgences would become a daily part of Chinese life. “When I grew up,” she explained, “I seriously never even dreamed about getting on a plane.”

Today, though, there are luxury shops everywhere, Ferraris and Lamborghinis cruising the streets, Gucci bags in hands, Rolex watches on wrists. “Brands that you only see in L.A. and New York, they have in the smaller cities,” said the 40-year-old. “You can’t recognize China anymore.”

China’s newfound tastes pair nicely with a growing love for fine wine, and that’s why Dierberg returns to her homeland a couple of times each year: She’s the daughter-in-law of Jim and Mary Dierberg, the owners of Santa Barbara County’s Starlane and Dierberg Vineyards, and represents those brands as the Asia-Pacific sales director. “It’s a huge market,” explained JiaMin. “It’s just growing unbelievably. The wine just flows to China and Hong Kong from all over the world.”

Until recently, the Chinese who could afford the good stuff opted for mostly French wines, but their attention is increasingly turning to California. Santa Barbara County — which has long enjoyed strong sales in Japan as well as increasing sales in other parts of Asia — is just now starting to tap in, and the bottles have been flying off the shelves, despite being nearly twice the price of what they cost here, thanks to a 48.5 percent import tax. According to the latest figures from The Wine Institute, American wine exports — of which 90 percent are Californian — enjoyed 42 percent growth in China last year, fetching $62 million total, and Fortune Magazine estimates that the Chinese wine consumption is growing by 70 percent annually, with imports expected to be 40 percent of that within the next five years. In short, the smog-choked Chinese skies are the limit.

As a native Chinese speaker, Dierberg — who moved to the United States in 1998 after attending college in Japan — had a leg up on the competition and started selling wine there in 2008. The Dierberg family now ships about 20 percent of its annual 30,000 cases of wine to Asia, with China consuming a big chunk of that. “I can’t keep up with the demand,” she explained, noting that the Starlane cabernet sauvignon is most popular. “This year, we have to go through three vintages.”

Jim Fiolek, the executive director of the Santa Barbara County Vintners Association, has tried to open winemakers’ eyes to the potential by hosting sales seminars and establishing connections to Chinese consumer organizations, but estimates that only around a dozen of the association’s more than 150 members actively sell to China today. “Producing world-class wines in Santa Barbara County is only half of the equation,” said Fiolek. “Making them available to the world balances the equation.”

Chinese Palates

In China, wine is traditionally mixed with Coca-Cola or 7-Up, and then usually downed with tastebud-skipping speed as a sign of mutual respect. “It’s all about gan bei! — bottoms up! — and chugging the whole thing down,” said Dierberg, who’s seen beer pitchers used as decanters and believes that New World wine is gaining popularity, in part, because it’s easier to chug than its tannic Old World cousins. But there’s also an emerging class of drinkers who “are starting to develop a palate and learning to appreciate fine wines,” said Dierberg, pointing out that Asian meals, where 10 courses are par for the course, are actually great opportunities for trying a variety of wines.

A couple of months ago, after six years of importing pet food to China, Santa Barbara High alum David Sciuto expanded his business by importing Santa Barbara Winery bottles to the coastal city of Qingdao, where he now lives much of the time. They’re selling remarkably fast — in part because that red tile-roofed city identifies itself as the Santa Barbara of China — but there is much outreach to be done. “The market is totally undereducated,” explained Sciuto, who said that most of the French and Australian wines available tend to be cheaply made and watered down, which is another reason why he wanted to bring his hometown juice to China. “We are not looking to flood the market or stores with California wine, but to slowly teach them why it’s better and educate them on the difference.”

The education goes both ways. When he started distributing wines to China two years ago, Christian Garvin, of Oreana Winery, entertained the romantic vision of bustling outdoor markets where his bottles would be sold from stands with smoked ducks and paper lanterns hanging from the rafters. “Turns out it’s not exactly like that,” laughed Garvin, whose distributor imports frozen shrimp to Los Angeles and found Oreana while looking to ship something back in the otherwise empty refrigerated containers. “It’s mostly in high-end restaurants and hotels. The nouveau riche, they want everything American they can find, whether it’s luxury cars or Levis or wines.”

Today Garvin sends about 15 percent of his production to China, or about 1,000 cases every two or three months, of both the Oreana and Mission Point labels, usually pinot noir, cabernet, and zinfandel. In April, Garvin welcomed a dozen or so restaurateurs from China to his Funk Zone winery, and seems rather pleased with how it’s all working out. “They pay their bills and are very easy to work with,” he said. “They know exactly what they want.”

Chinese Pitfalls

Though there’s money to be made, the path is fraught with pitfalls. “From my office in the Sta. Rita Hills, China appears to be the Wild, Wild West,” said Chad Melville, of Melville Winery, who is now selling pinot noir and chardonnay in China. “Crazy shit goes on there.”

Like many other wineries in the area, he was approached a handful of times by what he called “skimmers,” mostly American opportunists who wanted to bring Melville wines to China but had no experience doing so or any evidence of Chinese connections. In one situation, a very pushy guy kept trying to convince Melville with nonbinding offers, saying, “We’re not asking you to get married!” Melville replied, “I’m not sure I even want to date you!”

But then came a young Chinese man from Beijing, who, like Melville, graduated from USC, had an apartment in L.A., visited Melville Winery a few times as a regular customer, and was trying to carve a wine import niche out of his father’s Chinese real estate business. Plus, explained Melville, “He paid in full — that eliminated any skepticism.”

In addition to printing and posting Chinese labels, Melville had to put his 300 cases of wine through a series of chemistry, hygiene, and authenticity tests. Altogether, he called the extra work “pretty laborious.” And then once the wine reaches China, the rampant crime of counterfeiting becomes a concern, which is why the first move made by his agent —who is setting up a bunch of California wine shops in Beijing and Shanghai — was to trademark Melville Winery in China as at least some protection.

At Santa Barbara Winery, operations manager Dan Cerepanya had a similar experience: For about a year, he met with a parade of schemers until he started thinking, “Are we gonna miss out on the whole China thing?” Then came David Sciuto. “Since he was already doing business in China, we gave him a shot,” said Cerepanya, whose first shipment was 840 cases of pinot, chardonnay, riesling, and syrah. “The first one had sold within the week.” Both Cerepanya and Sciuto know that counterfeits will show up pretty soon, but see that as the price of doing good business in an emerging market, one that shows no signs of slowing.

“It’s kind of exciting for us. If we really had a bigger production facility, and could make more wine, we’d probably be selling a lot more to China,” said Cerepanya. “They are probably going to want more than we are going to be able to give them at some point.”

10,10,FL-2012-000100-CHN,Chongqing: The Kingdom of Ba - Bangkok Post,https://www.bangkokpost.com/travel/297670/chongqing-the-kingdom-of-ba,"Millennia before Chongqing became one of China's powerhouses it was home to an ancient Tai kingdom

Located on the Yangtze River in central China, Chongqing is not only a major city and transportation hub, but also a place of considerable historical and cultural significance. Standing here about four millennia ago was the Kingdom of Ba, believed to have been inhabited by Tai people.

What is believed to be the former location of the Kingdom of Ba’s capital in Chongqing.

The Tai are one of the major groups of indigenous people of Southeast Asia. At present, 90 million people divided into 80 groups speaking languages that belong to the Tai linguistic family inhabit a broad region, including not only Thailand and Laos but also northern Vietnam, southern China and eastern Myanmar.

Orathai Pholdi, director of Kasetsart University's Office of Agricultural Museum and Culture who has a keen interest in Tai culture, recently led a group of culture vultures to visit Chongqing and nearby areas in an effort to prove her theory that the Tai people lived there thousands of years ago.

""I believe Chongqing is located where the Kingdom of Ba was,"" she said. ""Ba was an ancient city of the Tai people dating back 4,000 years.

One of the many houses in the ancient town of Dongxi. They were modified by having walls erected downstairs and some now serve as shops.

""In other words, the Kingdom of Ba was where the Ai Lao Empire was located along the Yangtze River.""

She cited several Western academics, including Prof Terrien de la Couperie of the University of London who wrote The Cradle Of The Shan Race (1885) in which he proposed that the Tai founded the Ta Meuang Empire in Sichuan about 5,000 years ago. They later migrated south and established the Kingdom of Lanna.

She also quoted a Chinese chronicle from the time of the legendary Emperor Yu, some 4,000 years ago, about a land survey of southern China close to a large kingdom called Ta Meuang.

Another Chinese chronicle mentions a diplomatic delegation sent from the Middle Kingdom to the Kingdom of Ba around the same time.

The group led by Orathai visited the China Three Gorges Museum in Chongqing. The museum boasts more than 170,000 objects and displays 10 exhibitions, including one on Ba Yu, two ancient cities on the way to Sichuan.

According to the exhibition, the Ba culture was the first culture since the Chongqing region entered civilisation. It is the root of the regional culture of Chongqing. About 6,000-7,000 years ago, Neolithic culture flourished along both banks of the Xi River.

The pottery of Daxi and the stone artefacts of Yuxi are outstanding examples of the region's ancient civilisation. After the Shang and Zhou dynasties, which ran from the 16th-3rd centuries BC, the Ba people migrated to the Xi River region from the Jianghan plain where they originally lived.

Here, they expanded their territories and eventually established the unique Ba culture. The Kingdom of Ba came into existence.

A stone inscription dating back to the Song dynasty about 1,000 years ago tells the history of the Nanping Lao people and the cause of their migration. It is on view at Qijiang Museum after being moved from Dongxi, an ancient town southeast of the Sichuan River Basin in Guizhou province.

Despite the harsh environment and pressure from the Han Chinese, the Ba people fought bravely and formed a unique culture that gradually rooted in the Ba Yu culture over 2,000 years.

Although the kingdom fell during continuous wars, the Ba people retained their original culture, traditions and lifestyles for a long period of time.

During the Western Han dynasty (202BC-9AD), the development of China's southwestern region sped up the decline of Ba culture, which was assimilated into Chinese civilisation.

At Qijiang Museum in Nanping, about two hours from Chongqing, the group found evidence of the existence of the Nanping Lao people in the area.

According to Orathai, some groups of Tai people were named Lao after the Kingdom of Ai Lao.

The museum boasts models of cave paintings depicting a horse, a stilt house and people performing a dance. The real paintings were found at a 2,000-year-old cemetery in Qijiang's most ancient city where the Nanping Lao people once dwelt. Its location is in a valley, a 90-minute drive from the city centre and another hour's walk along an earthen road into a forested area.

Another highlight at the museum is a stone inscription about the Nanping Lao people and the cause of their migration to Yunnan, southwestern China.

The inscription dates to the Song dynasty (960-1279AD) while the ancient script is believed to have been invented around 3,000 years ago. According to the inscription, more than 4,000 Lao families lived in present-day Chongqing and the surrounding areas, where the climate was hot and humid.

Men farmed and fished, while women did the housework. Many Nanping Lao people were killed during their wars against invaders and the survivors later migrated to Yunnan in the Han dynasty (206BC-220AD). The inscription is one of the four stone engravings found in Dongxi, an ancient town southeast of the Sichuan River Basin in Guizhou province. The group led by Orathai went there just to find the decaying inscription. The 2,200-year-old town was called Wanshouchang (Long Life) and also the First Town of the Mountains and Rivers in Eastern Sichuan.

People there still live in houses raised on piles, but have built walls downstairs and used the space as shops or rooms.

""Its significance lies in the theory that Ba was an ancient city of the Tai at least 4,000 years ago and related to the Nanping Lao people. There are 2,000-year-old cave paintings of a house on stilts and people dancing and holding silk balls, similar to the Tai rabam lukchuang dance,"" said Orathai.

She is certain that the people of Ba were the Tai, reasoning that the Tai grew non-glutinous rice similar to the 7,000-year-old fossilised grains unearthed in Hemudu in Zhejiang province.

The Tai also weaved silk, lived in stilt houses in flood-prone areas and made glazed black pottery, Orathai said.","Tue, 12 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.bangkokpost.com/newdesign/assets/images/bg/default-pic-w600.jpg,"['ago', 'chongqing', 'ancient', 'nanping', 'tai', 'museum', 'culture', 'ba', 'lao', 'kingdom']", 
11,11,FL-2012-000100-CHN,Counterfeit Chinese Microchips Are Getting So Good They Can't Be Identified - Business Insider,https://www.businessinsider.com/counterfeit-parts-from-china-raise-grave-concerns-for-both-us-companies-and-national-security-2012-6,"YouTube/CNN

There appears to be little doubt China steals both U.S. commercial and military secrets through hacking in addition to selling counterfeit electronic parts to customers of U.S. companies and to the Department of Defense (DoD).

But the adverse affects of these practices, both financially and militarily, seem both substantial and largely unknown.

We spoke with Louis P. Feuchtbaum, a former assistant district attorney in the Bronx who has worked extensively with electronic fraud, and represents large IT companies to help them deal with counterfeit electronics and procurement fraud, to gain a better understanding of what's at play here.

He says that when a company suspects its counterfeits products are flooding the market, it needs to do an internal investigation to see where they're coming from; how they're getting into the U.S.; who has them in the country; and how they are being resold so that the trade can be shut down (through referrals to law enforcement or civil lawsuits).

As a former Naval officer who served in combat, Feuchtbaum is in a unique position to also understand the military aspect of the problem because he knows what's it like to be ""bobbing around on ships that lose propulsion"" and has seen service members seriously injured because of failed technology.

He regards the economic and safety issues involved in counterfeit electronic products as ""undefinable and undeniable because they could be so grave.""

To understand how the situation has become so bad — and what can be done to mitigate the problems counterfeit parts cause — it helps to first distinguish between its corporate and military aspects of counterfeit electronics.

Corporate Counterfeiting

""As commercial conflicts become more critical to national security, industrial espionage is a very serious issue,"" said Feuchtbaum. ""The U.S. economy has been steadily shifting away from manufacturing to the development of its intellectual property. We are the genius that powers much of the world's engines. If ... our intellect/design/ingenuity can just be swiped pretty easily because of these products that have been installed that compromise our communications, the consequences for that could be grave.""

The most expensive part of bringing an electronics product to market is research and development, followed by significant costs in maintaining quality control through production.

So the way a manufacturer of genuine products makes up for overhead costs and increases profit margins is on the selling of the individual product from overseas plants.

Wikimedia Commons

But counterfeit manufacturers don't have much overhead.

By developing stuff that kind of looks and functions like the genuine product — so that it passes initial testing and enters the marketplace — counterfeiters only pay the cheap cost to manufacture an inferior product.

Then they ""undersell the genuine manufacturers by very substantial amounts"" to create a market force for their fake products.

The result is that a company's brand and corporate interests are damaged each time a purchased product fails or doesn't perform up to its intended specifications.

""When you have counterfeit products you lose the assurance of reliability — quality control goes out the window,"" Feuchtbaum said. ""You may be dealing with algorithms and programming that could work until too many demands are placed upon a system [and] you make it to a point where actually component failure due to material breakdown.""

Feuchtbaum notes that ""China is a huge source for electronic counterfeit, and they don't have very strong enforcement mechanisms"" because prosecutions are controlled at the local level where government corruption is rampant.

""It really is kind of the Wild West over there in terms of electronic counterfeiting,"" Feuchtbaum said. ""And it goes on to a really extreme degree.""

But when Feuchtbaum and his associates at Sideman and Bancroft trace a counterfeit product to the actual time and place of manufacture, they find shill companies that churn out fakes en masse and sell to multiple different distributors (who sell again) so that the counterfeit products take their own unique paths to the marketplace.

Thus it's difficult to detect and shut down corrupt manufacturers because the path is ""like a spiderweb"" and ""provides a degree of insularity to a government if they are involved in that type of activity.""

And although companies are becoming more sophisticated when creating publicly and privately-known product markings (e.g. trademarks, holograms, etc.) — which give the marketplace a degree of comfort that what they're buying is genuine — Feuchtbaum said that ""it's always just a matter of holding back for a flood. There's just way too much money here.""

The flood occurs at the moment when the replicas are so good that even experts can't tell the difference. At that point the market is being given a false sense of assurance and counterfeit products are readily accepted as genuine.

""This is where it gets a little bit scary,"" Feuchtbaum said. ""There's a continual race that there are quality control checks on the genuine products that the counterfeiters can't copy. And those are good, and they work, but usually only for a period of time.""

YouTube/CNN

Just how costly is it when the quality controls are compromised and the floodgates open? That, according to Feuchtbaum, is inconceivable.

""There are cases I have been involved with where counterfeit products relating to a single product — not even a product line [but] a single part number — ... costs the American company tens of millions of dollars. For a single part. Take that and multiply it across product lines and then across the whole production of the company, and the losses are almost uncountable.""

That's why most large IT companies have their own distribution channels with quality controls to thwart distributors and resellers from buying potentially counterfeit products off the secondary markets.

The bottom line, according to Feuchtbaum, is that ""if one buys only through an authorized distributor, the chance of getting counterfeit is severely reduced.""

Nevertheless, some ""honest companies that make great products don't comprehend the severity of the problem."" Feuchtbaum can think of at least one well-known company with a big market following that doesn't even track the serial numbers of its products. By neglecting to do so, the company ""severely hampers"" its ability to combat counterfeits in the market.

Military Counterfeiting

In addition to the regular problems with counterfeit products of higher product failure, Feuchtbaum explained that the DoD is facing ""a very large vulnerability for national defense.""

It's impossible to know how deeply embedded these criminal products are in a supply chain because once they get through the initial filters of a quality check and feel genuine, they could be in place for a long time if they don't fail.

""And if a country has designed a back door because their real intent is to get access to a system to affect its operations at some time, they want that product to work because they don't want it to be replaced,"" Feuchtbaum said.

A recent Senate report, titled Inquiry Into Counterfeit Electronic Parts In The Department Of Defense Supply Chain, ""uncovered overwhelming evidence of large numbers of counterfeit parts making their way into critical defense systems.""

The investigation found 1,800 cases of counterfeit electronic parts involving over one million suspect parts in 2009-10 alone, thereby exposing ""a defense supply chain that relies on hundreds of unveiled independent distributors to supply electronic parts for some of our most sensitive systems.""

The report concluded, among other things, that China is the ""dominant source"" of counterfeit products that enter the DoD supply chain, that the Chinese government does little to stop it and that the DoD doesn't know the ""scope and impact"" of these parts on critical defense systems.

Chinese J-20 compared to American F-22 Raptor China Defense

Feuchtbaum called the report ""jaw-dropping"" and cited examples of U.S. weapons having counterfeit parts as why this stuff is ""so scary when you really think about it.""

Serious problems are created through outright spying — tracking the communications of American citizens, corporations and government to steal critical information — which can be used to enhance research and development at a low cost.

The other vulnerability arises through the employment of back doors, which are features designed into a product when someone wants to gain access to that electronic module at some point without permissions and without detection.

""It's almost like having a skeleton key to your neighbor's home, and you could just enter at will without your neighbor's permission,"" Feuchtbaum said.

Feuchtbaum said to think of counterfeit products as cyber land mines — they are things planted by the enemy that are secretly hidden away until the time comes when a threat confronts them. And these land mines are especially destructive because they are installed in the critical infrastructure in the homeland as well as in critical machinery of defense overseas.

""Let's say an entity, maybe China, has adverse security interests to the United States. The U.S. does its analysis and says 'In this region of the world where there is conflict, we have the following defense resources... so we could go ahead and feel safe that we have enough deterrents there.'

""The calculus would be changed a lot if the other country looked and said 'Yeah, they've got all these resources here but we know that their bombs aren't going to work, their planes aren't going fly, that we could invade their communications, that we can disrupt their supply chains once we go in the back door and … shut down those functionalities.'""

Compounding the issue is that things like bombers are going to have a life of decades, so the DoD needs to be comfortable that as parts are replaced on the airplanes they are being replaced by only genuine parts. If the DoD doesn't have quality controls, it's inviting problems years down the line.

YouTube/CNN

What can be done?

When asked how he felt, as a former officer, about the infiltration of counterfeit parts into the DoD, Feuchtbaum said that it ""causes a very grave fear that lack of diligence could cause the loss of American life.""

That diligence, for both IT companies and the DoD, comes in the form of having robust anti-counterfeiting programs that keep counterfeit products out of the supply chain.

Feuchtbaum said that the most robust programs continually test the marketplace to see what's out there, know what counterfeit products look like, constantly manufacture new controls to ensure that the products they're selling are not being successfully copied, and update the guidance they give to the marketplace — as well as immigration and customs enforcement — on how to spot fakes.

""For companies that don't [have robust anti-counterfeiting programs] ... there is a rising tide of counterfeits in the supply chain and it becomes more difficult to ensure that you're buying genuine,"" Feuchtbaum said.

Which is precisely what has happened to the U.S. military. Feuchtbaum posits that the best course of actions for the DoD is to begin purchasing electronic parts only from authorized supply chains or the manufacturers themselves.

They better start soon because an unknown number of cyber land mines are already installed.","Sat, 16 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.insider.com/4fdf25c66bb3f73861000010?width=1200&format=jpeg,"['chinese', 'cant', 'supply', 'counterfeit', 'products', 'good', 'feuchtbaum', 'electronic', 'dod', 'genuine', 'getting', 'parts', 'companies', 'product', 'identified', 'microchips']",

A mysterious bronze statue in Sanxingdui Museum near Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, has attracted droves of fascinated visitors. Huang Zhiling finds out more.

Among the most mysterious displays at the Sanxingdui Museum in Guanghan, near the Sichuan provincial capital of Chengdu, is a bronze statue of a barefoot man.

With anklets and clenched fists in an exaggerated pose, the 2.62 meter high, 180-kilogram statue is believed to represent a king or a great sorcerer during the Shu Kingdom, the name for Sichuan in ancient times. It symbolizes an integration of theocracy and monarchy.

Dating back about 3,100 years, the statue is crowned with a sun motif and coated with three layers of tight, short sleeved bronze ""clothing"" decorated with a dragon and overlaid with a checked ribbon.

""The garment could be the country's oldest existing dragon robe,"" says Huang Nengfu, a professor of the Academy of Art and Design at Tsinghua University and an eminent researcher in Chinese clothing from different dynasties. He also thinks that the pattern is the work of the famous Shu Embroidery, an intangible heritage of Sichuan.

Cooperating with a famous garment producer in Beijing, Huang reproduced the silk robe and donated it to the Chengdu Shu Brocade and Embroidery Museum in 2007, where the robe is now on display.

The robe has also changed the traditional view that Shu Embroidery began in the mid-Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Instead, it shows that Shu Embroidery appeared in the Shang Dynasty (c.16th century-11th century BC), according to Wang Yuqing, a Taiwan-based Chinese clothing historian.

The archeological discoveries in Sangxindui Ruins, near the museum, have re-written China's history.

""Before the excavation of Sanxingdui, it was believed that Sichuan had a history dating back to 3,000 years. Thanks to the excavation, it is now believed that civilized culture first appeared in Sichuan 5,000 years ago,"" says Chen Xiandan, deputy curator of Sichuan Provincial Museum.

Sanxingdui, which means ""three star mounds"" in English, is so named because the ruins are located in a village where there were three mounds.

The ruins, located on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, also serve as a convincing proof that the origins of Chinese civilization are diverse, archaeologists say.

They say that the Sanxingdui Ruins dispel theories that the Yellow River was the sole starting point of Chinese civilization.

""The discovery of the San-xingdui Ruins was accidental,"" Chen says. ""The treasure had been buried there for thousands of years and nobody knew it. It seemed to appear from nowhere.""

In the spring of 1929, Yan Daocheng, a villager in Guanghan, found a stone while digging a ditch in his fields. Removing the stone, he found a hole beneath it. In the hole were objects made of jade.

Fearing that fellow villagers might learn about his discovery, Yan immediately covered the hole with the stone and mud, and returned home.

Later that night, Yan and his family re-dug the hole and removed more than 400 jade objects.

Yan later sold some of the objects in Chengdu, arousing the attention of cultural relics dealers.

They flocked to Guanghan, attempting to purchase more.

""The popularity of Guanghan jade in turn attracted the attention of archaeologists,"" Chen says.

In 1933, an archaeological team from Huaxi University in Chengdu headed for San-xingdui to undertake the first formal excavation of the ruins.

Since then, several generations of archaeologists have toiled at Sanxingdui and more than 10,000 relics dating between 5,000 and 3,000 years ago have been unearthed.

Archaeologists around the world were excited by more discoveries in the 1980s. They included the remains of large palaces in 1980, the remnants of eastern, western and southern walls in 1984 and the discovery of two large sacrificial pits in 1986.

The discoveries prove that Sanxingdui contains the ruins of an ancient city that was the political, economic and cultural center of the ancient Shu Kingdom.

Almost all relics unearthed from the ruins are displayed in the Sanxingdui Museum.

Opened to visitors in late 1997, the museum has drawn some 10 million visitors from different parts of the world who are fascinated by its unique displays.

SHANGHAI - China's State Administration for Religious Affairs is against plans to list temples on the stock markets by some local governments, a top official said Tuesday.

Listing the temples on the stock exchanges harms the legal rights and damages the image of the religious community. It also harms the feelings of the believers, said Liu Wei, a deputy department director of the administration.

Temples are the sites for believers to carry out religious activities and are non-profit organizations. There is no precedent in the world to list the temples on the stock market, Liu said at a meeting in Shanghai.

Developing the economy should have its limits and should not cross the moral lines, he said.

Many of Chinese Buddhist and Tao temples have long been tourist sites and sources of revenues for local governments, which have a strong desire to make the temples more attractive and more lucrative. Listing in Shanghai or Hong Kong is a natural choice for them.

Famen Temple, dubbed as the ancestor of pagoda temples in northwest China's Shaanxi province, was expected to be listed in Hong Kong in 2013. The Baoji municipal government postponed the plan at the end of April as the second phase of the expansion project had not started construction.

Shaolin Temple, China's most famous Buddhist temple in central Henan province, was also pushed to be listed on the stock market at the end of 2009 to attract more investment and tourists. The plan was aborted due to pressure from the Buddhist abbot Shi Yongxin and religious authorities.

China currently has about 139,000 religious sites. Of them 33,000 are Buddhist temples, 9,000 Tao temples, 35,000 mosques, 6,000 Catholic churches and 56,000 Christian churches.","Wed, 06 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/attachement/jpg/site1/20130421/180373d28c1012deb56e07.jpg,"['listing', 'religious', 'buddhist', 'province', 'temple', 'chinas', 'temples', 'stock', 'govt', 'sites', 'tao', 'market']",

Floodwater turned roads into rivers, burst sewers and destroyed homes. At least 20 people were killed, hundreds displaced and the city's economy was crippled.

For the two thirds of Lagos's population that live in the city's slums, floods are a fact of life, just like a lack of clean running water. When it floods, foul water containing sewage runs into slum homes, sometimes reaching waist height. Slum dwellers say they repeatedly visit health centers because of sickness after floods, spending scant money on healthcare. A huge proportion say floods deny them job opportunities or affect their livelihoods.

Lagos raises awareness, battles to adapt

Located in suburban Boluo county, Huizhou city in southern Guangdong province, the replica of the centuries-old Hallstatt has been open to visitors only a dozen days, yet many of the homes in the residential complex have already been snapped up.

Of the 400 villas constructed in the 20,000-square-meter European-style town, 150 have been sold, for an average price of 9,000 yuan ($1,425), double the average housing price in the county seat of Boluo.

More small and medium-sized apartments will follow in the town in coming years, according to Shi Lingyun, executive deputy manager-general of the Huizhou branch of the project's developer, the China Minmetals Corporation.

Meanwhile, the firm has decided to take a step further and build the town, initially conceived as a straightforward medium and high-end housing complex, into a commercial district and tourism attraction.

Some stores, including wedding photography studios and bars, have agreed to enter into the town's central area -- in which assisted living facilities had originally been planned -- and more ""mature brands"" will be brought in, said Shi.

Shi also noted possibilities of turning the town into a new tourism destination in the Pearl River Delta, a world-renowned manufacturing hub.

The 6-billion-yuan replica, regarded as a bold example of China's knock-off culture, has won instant fame as it has drawn both wows and discontent at home and abroad after being announced a year ago. That chatter seems to have proven a positive PR exercise for the people behind it.

The controversy has also benefited Hallstatt, which was listed as a world natural heritage site by UNESCO in 1997.

In 2005, only 47 Chinese people visited the lake-side Austrian village.The number skyrocketed to 8,700 six years later, Martin Woller, an official with the Austrian Consulate-General in Guangzhou, said when he and Hallstatt mayor Alexander Scheutz flew to China earlier this month to attend a ceremony for the project.

He said the surge in tourist numbers was ""unexpected"" and noted goings-on in Boluo county were Hallstatt's ""best advertisement in China.""

He said as Austrians, they are honored to have an Austrian-style town on the opposite side of the world. His tone was echoed by the mayor in an ebullient speech delivered at the ceremony.

Controversy remains

Shi said he would no longer worry about a lawsuit over infringement on intellectual property rights that critics had expected.

""The Austrian delegation has given the nod to the project. They see it as unique, a part of the cultural exchange between the two countries,"" he explained.

Some analysts view Austria's approval of the complex as predictable, given that China has become the country's second-largest trade partner.

Shi objected that the project is not sheer plagiarism of Hallstatt and instead it incorporates styles from a number of Austrian towns.

However, his comments can not convince everyone.

""The place looks very 'European' and impressive. But it's not good enough as a replica of a UNESCO-listed world heritage site,"" Li Ting, a local resident, told Xinhua during her tour of the town.

""It's understandable to learn from foreign architecture, but we should show respect to our own history,"" said a senior Chinese architect who wished to remain anonymous.

Ma Yansong, another celebrated architect, also said a copy-cat housing scheme is not acceptable, arguing, ""Only when we get down to studying our own culture, will there be something 'original'.""

Shi admitted the success of the project came ""by chance.""

""We chose Austria simply because China already has British style, American style, French style, Spanish style, Italian style and Austrian style. To be honest, we didn't expect so much aftermath.""

Nevertheless, he said he believed the developer would not undertake similar projects.

""Like ours, many Chinese real estate projects in China aim to open a window for consumers to see the world. In the future, maybe we should create more housing projects featuring the Chinese architectural style,"" Shi added.","Fri, 08 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20120608/0013729e4ad9113c1ed51c.jpg,"['chinese', 'world', 'village', 'stirs', 'huizhou', 'town', 'austrian', 'style', 'hallstatt', 'controversy1', 'china', 'replica', 'projects']",

[Photo/chinadaily.com.cn]

The strategic partnership signing ceremony of St. Regis Lijiang and Cessna Aircraft Company was held at Lijiang Sanyi Airport on June 9, signifying St. Regis Lijiang has become the first to provide private jet service in China.

Cessna Aircraft Company became one of St. Regis’s business partners and will be responsible for customizing travel plans including private jets for international clients.

The Company, founded in 1927, has made nearly 200 thousand airplanes which remain accident-free for a total of more than 25 million hours.

""A high-end project requires an investor to consider all the factors including resources, safety, locations and, most of all, services. That’s why we have cooperated with Cessna in a bid to enhance our service and bring us to the international market,""Luo Lin, chairman of the Jinlin Real Estate Development Cooperation said at the ceremony.

""St. Regis Lijiang is not just a place for vacation and resort, it 's an art of lifestyle and a platform for culture exchange."" says Luo. With a collaboration of world renowned brand, Miss Luo said she strongly believes St. Regis Lijiang will continue the legendary St. Regis brand and bring an extradinary impression.

"" I believe with the signing of world-class private jet, St. Regis Lijiang will offer travellers a new dimension of grace, luxury and hospitality in this beautiful city, "" said Mr. Qian Jin, senior vice president of operations, Greater China, Starwood Hotels & Resorts.

"" I believe there will be a large development space for high-end travel and holiday-spending in China and meanwhile more real estate related with high-end travel will emerge to meet people’s needs for life and health,"" said Wong Ting Chung, chairman of Hong Kong Nameson Group. The St. Regis Lijiang Residences is a project that St. Regis collaborates with Jinlin Group.

""According to my knowledge, St. Regis Lijiang Residences is made to meet not only the requirements of the St. Regis’s global standards but introduces it’s property management and provides services in accordance with the demands of St. Regis’s global brand for property sales. It’ll be expecting a leisurely lifestyle and I’m confident about this project,"" said Wong.

Covering more than 250,000 square meters, the St. Regis Lijiang Residences provide services for hotels, business trips to cultural events.

Please disregard the previous date information listed below.

A new documentary on internationally renowned Chinese artist Ai Weiwei can soon be seen on local theater screens. ""Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry,"" which received the Special Jury Prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival, provides an insider's portrait of China's most famous contemporary artist and the country's most outspoken domestic critic.

Ai Weiwei is known for his confrontational, unabashed artworks that usually are very critical of his country. Chinese authorities have responded by censoring him (via shutting down his blog), beating him up, tearing down his studio and detaining him in undisclosed locations.

In April 2011, Ai Weiwei was detained at the Beijing airport as he attempted to board a flight to Hong Kong, which sparked a protest movement among the international art community who demanded his release.

Locally, the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego staged a 24-hour silent protest last May to show its support of the artist and voice disapproval with the Chinese government's actions. Artists, community members and museum staff were invited to sit in silence for one hour in the artist's ""Marble Chair,"" a series of sculptural works (two of the chairs were later purchased by MCASD and are now part of its collection).

You can see Ai Weiwei's work, ""Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads: Gold"" (2010) on view now (and for the first time in the U.S.) at MCASD Downtown through July 29.

In conjunction with the film's release, Sundance Selects (the film's distributor) is launching a social media campaign in the artist's honor. Drawing inspiration from Ai Weiwei's famous photographs (from his exhibition ""F--- Off"") giving the middle finger to symbols of injustice in his homeland (Tiananmen Square, the Bird's Nest Olympic Stadium), participants are being asked to ""#RaiseYourFinger"" and share in digital protest via photos of themselves flipping the bird to various societal injustices. The submitted photos will be featured in a larger photo mosaic, which will be presented to Ai Weiwei via social media, as a tribute upon his upcoming June 22 release from limited house arrest.

You can submit your photos by uploading to the official ""Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry"" Facebook page or by tweeting and tagging ""@AWWNeverSorry #RaiseYourFinger.""

The film will open in San Diego theaters on August 3. In the meantime, check out the trailer below.

COPENHAGEN - Chinese President Hu Jintao arrived in the Danish capital of Copenhagen Thursday for a state visit aimed at furthering the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and the Nordic nation.

This is the first state visit to Denmark by a Chinese head of state since the two countries established diplomatic ties 62 years ago.

Chinese officials have described the trip as a ""milestone"" in the development of China-Denmark relations.

During his stay in Copenhagen, Hu will meet Queen Margrethe II and Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt on enlargement of all-round cooperation between the two countries.

As Denmark is holding the presidency of the European Union (EU) in the first half of this year, Hu will also exchange his views ""in an in-depth way"" with Danish leaders on the current international economic situation and the ongoing euro-zone crisis, said the Chinese officials.

The two sides are expected to sign a host of cooperation documents on investment, tariffs, energy, environment protection, agriculture, education and culture, the officials said.

""I very much look forward to the historic visit of President Hu Jintao,"" Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said in a June 6 statement.

""China's role and relevance in the development of large parts of the world has grown rapidly in recent years. Both Denmark and China have much to gain by a closer relationship and I look forward to discussing how we can further strengthen the depth and breadth of our strategic partnership,"" she said.

In recent years, the China-Denmark relations have been steadily enhanced with greater political mutual trust and respect and expanded economic cooperation and trade.

In 2008, the two nations established a comprehensive strategic partnership.

Denmark now is China's third largest trading partner in the Nordic region. In 2011, two-way trade between the two countries stood at 9.2 billion U.S. dollars, increasing by 18 percent over the previous year.

In recent years, the two countries have strengthened cooperation in the fields of climate change, energy and the environment, research and innovation, and education.

Given Denmark's status as an important member of the European Union, the Chinese president's visit to the Nordic country would also promote the China-EU relations, analysts said.

Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Song Tao said Monday that Hu's visit to Denmark is expected to improve the bilateral political ties featuring mutual respect, equality and mutual trust, and to blueprint further development of the relationship.

""President Hu Jintao's visit, the first by a Chinese president since China and Denmark set up diplomatic ties, will open a new chapter in the development of bilateral relations,"" he said.

From Denmark, Hu will travel to Los Cabos, Mexico, for next week's summit of the Group of Twenty (G20), which will address pressing issues affecting the global economic growth and stability.

The Los Cabos summit convenes at a time when the global economy is facing great risks to growth and stability. The euro-zone debt crisis, slowdown in major developed nations and even in emerging economies, and high unemployment rates in parts of the world are posing threats to a fragile recovery.

Speaking at a press briefing Monday, Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai expressed the hope that the G20 summit would continue to promote economic growth and stability against the backdrop of the volatile world economic situation.","Thu, 14 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20120615/0013729e48091144b27618.jpg,"['denmark', 'chinese', 'development', 'visit', 'economic', 'hu', 'minister', 'president', 'jintao', 'starts', 'state']",

23,23,FL-2012-000100-CHN,From the frontlines |Books |chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2012-06/12/content_15494885.htm,"Hong Kong-based journalist Susanna Cheung Chui-yung gets a warm welcome from Palestinians at a refugee camp in 2002. Provided to China Daily

A Hong Kong war correspondent's newest book focuses on ordinary people in conflict zones. Xu Jingxi speaks with her in Guangzhou.

A group of Israeli soldiers broke into a house in Delin village in Palestine late one night in 2003. The homeowner, a Palestinian college student who was showering, rushed out - wrapped in a towel - to meet the intruders. The reason for the raid was that the young Palestinian had carelessly told Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint that he was a political science student. Consequently, he was suspected of participating in a political movement against Israel.

But the student wasn't detained after his interrogation.

This is one of the stories Hong Kong-based independent journalist Susanna Cheung Chui-yung shared in her latest book, On the Scene in the Middle East (Zhongdong Xianchang).

The author joined an event for the book's Chinese mainland release. It was organized by the Guangdong bureau of Sina.com in Guangdong's provincial capital Guangzhou in June.

Cheung's girl-next-door appearance, marked by dimples, a sweet smile and bouts of giggling, is distinct from the stereotype of tough-looking women war correspondents like Marie Colvin, who wore an eye patch after a rocket propelled grenade damaged her left eye in Sri Lanka until she was killed this year in Syria.

Cheung's books also break from war reporting conventions. They don't chronicle battlefield adventures or focus on interviews with important figures in the conflicts.

""My books are about ordinary people and their stories, and show how they live under fire and what they think about their lives in unrest and wars,"" the correspondent says.

The 47-year-old has published four books about her war zone experiences.

Since 1999, she has covered Kosovo, East Timor's independence referendum, the Iraq War, Latin American revolutions and the Arab Spring. She has interviewed such political leaders as Yasser Arafat and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.

""I write to challenge stereotypes about certain places and their people,"" she says.

Another story in her new book is about a young Palestinian man, whom the Israeli government deemed a ""terrorist"".

The ""cute"" young man moved Cheung to tears when he told her his greatest wish was to return to Gaza from Ramallah, where the Palestinian National Authority headquarters are located, to care for his parents and marry his girlfriend.

""That might not be anything special to most people but is a long-cherished dream for these people in this war-torn place,"" Cheung says.

""No one is born a terrorist. We should know someone before we label them as a terrorist. If we define someone as a terrorist, we should think about what pushes them to go to such extremes. Then, we can find solutions and end wars.""

Cheung's motivation for traversing conflict zones came from her dissatisfaction with the mainstream media's often biased reporting and its general failure to analyze wars beyond the state level.

The journalist says she didn't know much about the Middle East before she arrived in 2001. She remembers seeing an online image of an Afghani woman peering out through black cloth.

""I wanted to know what Afghani women's lives are like and exactly what fundamentalism is,"" she recalls.

""I wasn't able to find much information from the reports available then. So, I decided to go there to find out for myself.""

Cheung was shocked to see how the extremely conservative Taliban rule the country with severe punishments.

""I felt as if I had been transported to the Middle Ages,"" Cheung recalls.

""Thieves would have their hands cut off, and women who committed adultery would be stoned to death. At that time, women were not allowed to work or receive education after age 11.""

However, Cheung emphasizes that it's over-generalizing to view Islamic fundamentalism as violent domination.

""I also discovered some fundamentalists bury their head in the Quran, without any interest in politics,"" she says.

""They tended to influence their fellows in a peaceful way - by preaching texts.""

Cheung Ping-ling, who worked as a war correspondent for the Hong Hong-based newspaper Ming Pao from 1995-2005, says: ""Cheung Chui-yung's care for ordinary people impresses me most. Readers rarely see such rich personal stories in the mainstream media.""

Cheung Ping-ling believes Cheung Chui-yung's status as an independent journalist might have ""forced"" her to develop her signature human touch.

""It's difficult for independent journalists to get permits to press conferences and interviews with officials,"" Cheung Ping-ling explains.

""Their limited funds mean they can't afford accommodation at safe hotels and often must live in residential housing. But living with locals helps Cheung Chui-yung discover thought-provoking stories.""

China Fortune magazine's editor-in-chief Ning Er says Cheung impressed him when he first heard about her in 2002. He has read all her books.

""Most international news nowadays focuses on analyzing how clashes of national interests lead to wars and ignores the people living in those countries,"" says Ning, who's an international politics graduate from Peking University.

""Cheung's books stand out by offering readers both vivid stories she uncovered on the scene and sufficient background about relevant history, politics, religion and culture. Then, she leaves judgment to the readers.""

Cheung Chui-yung says she tries hard not to take sides.

She shared some powerful photographs at the book launch.

One shows a contemptuous Palestinian man forced to strip down to his underwear and shirt in front of Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint. Another shows a Palestinian child hugging the ruins of his bombed home, with sorrow in his eyes.

""I didn't put these shocking photos in my book because I don't want to give any visuals that might influence readers' judgment,"" Cheung explains.

""I just want to tell the stories and let readers ponder them themselves.""

Cheung favors direct quotes to ensure objectivity. She also presents dialogues in question-and-answer format.

But despite her plain, matter-of-fact reporting style, Cheung's vivid descriptions - often of sceneries - sometimes reveal her emotions.

For example, she describes the moon over olive trees - whose branches are a peace symbol - on her way to Jerusalem.

""The conflicts under the olives never end,"" Cheung writes in On the Scene in the Middle East.

""Maybe peace is a naughty child, who is hanging over the moon, unwilling to come down to this land.""

Cheung's writing style and observational conveyances resemble those of Polish war correspondent and writer Ryszard Kapuscinski (1932-2007), who earned six Nobel Prize nominations, Hong Kong literary critic Leung Man-tao says.

""She pays attention to details in interviewees' tone and the environment at that moment,"" Leung says.

""And she describes details to manifest the interview without any preconceptions.""

Life is at stake at every moment in war. On Cheung's first trip to Afghanistan in 2001, a policeman threatened to shoot her because she violated fundamentalist beliefs and secretly photographed local people.

But Cheung doesn't believe it's time to stop, although her hair is graying and her eyes often dim with fatigue.

Her passion for the mission still burns.

""I'm still young, and I want to be young forever and continue traveling, discovering and writing,"" says Cheung, who hopes to write a book for every area where ""the truth is blurry"".

24,24,FL-2012-000100-CHN,Why the Montero is useful in flood-prone roads - Inquirer.net,https://business.inquirer.net/63393/why-the-montero-is-useful-in-flood-prone-roads,"Mitsubishi has been able to overcome its past crises by focusing on what’s important in the motoring industry: to come up with a product that is practical, desirable, relevant and, if not affordable, then at least offers good value for money. The Mitsubishi Montero Sport embodies all of these values, achieving something of a Holy Grail in the motoring industry, starting in 2009.

In all, there are seven variants available, with 4×4 and 4×2 drivetrains, manuals and automatics (with paddle shifters on the top-model GTV variant), and with only one engine powering six variants, the new for the 21st-century 4D56 diesel engine, equipped with common-rail direct injection technology and variable geometry turbine technology for added assurance, providing a power output of 178 ps and 350 Newton-meters of torque. A new for 2012, 3.0 gasoline engine model in 4×2 a/t trim was also silently launched, but Mitsubishi Motors Philippines claims that with limited availability of units, they aren’t pushing this variant aggressively yet. With its huge price spread—from a low of P1.180 million to a high of just over P1.7 million—the Montero Sport encompasses a very broad spectrum of car buyers in the market.

ADVERTISEMENT

At just under P1.180 million, the Montero Sport is able to entice buyers previously looking at an AUV/MPV into a proper SUV, a factor that has allowed it to be the second-best-selling vehicle of 2010, and the third-best-selling private passenger vehicle in 2011, an MPV from another Japanese car company sneaking past it by a mere 7 units. Considering that the aforementioned MPV is sold to fleet accounts as a commercial vehicle for hire, whereas the Montero Sport is personal purchase, or a high-end executive car plan, it’s a testament to how well thought out the Montero Sport is, from a marketing and engineering/design-specification point of view.

Going in its fourth year, the Montero Sport has been receiving small but useful updates. The biggest change came last year with the introduction of the VGT-equipped engines and the 5-speed automatic plus a multi-media system featuring GPS Navigation. In other years, the changes were minor such as color changes. For 2012, the Montero Sport receives another useful upgrade. Previously, the second set of air-conditioning vents were all the way on the third row, and to one side. The 2012 Montero Sport has the second set of a/c vents positioned above the B-pillars and pointing directly toward the second-row passengers. It makes sense, since the third-row seats are rarely occupied, and if they are, it’s a short stint for in-city trips. The 2012 Montero Sport also finally gets rear wheel disc brakes that offer better, more consistent and more fade-free performance, whereas previous models made do with drum brakes. Magnesium paddle shifters, a feature previously only available on the top-model GTV 4×4 variants, as well as a new high-contrast instrument cluster with chrome ring accents, round out the small but useful improvements of the 2012 Montero Sport.

Hearing consumer reports, many people say that the Montero Sport is impressive indeed, but could still use some more improvements, chief of which is the heavy steering feel. Other people claim that it is just too heavy, especially when compared to its key rivals from Toyota, Hyundai and Isuzu. A lighter steering effort could perhaps see more sales. The brakes, however, are amazing. I have personally witnessed repeated stops from 160 kph on Clark International Speedway with a full load of passengers, the Montero Sport driven by Masaki Hirosaka, Mitsubishi Ralli-Art’s factory rally driver for the Paris-Dakar rallies and himself a multiple Dakar Rally Champion. Credit also goes to the OEM all-terrain Bridgestone tires measuring a meaty 265/65R17 and the firm, road-biased suspension. Other comments from owners include requests that the seating position could have been made better, the steering wheel higher, and with more anti-submarining tilt built into the driver’s seat.

And with the rainy season now more or less in effect in our country, everyone gets reminded of how useful a full-sized diesel SUV will be in our flood-stricken roads. The Montero Sport has impressive flood-fording abilities, and while not as capable off-road trailing as some of its competitors, it excels in loose surfaces like your typical provincial dirt and farm-to-market roads, the type of off-roading most average Filipino motorists will ever see and use their cars for. A limited slip differential is also standard on certain models, giving the Montero Sport more traction and stability on less than ideal surfaces.

New competitors are expected to arrive in the coming months, such as Chevrolet’s anticipated Trailblazer, a new Everest or similar SUV from Ford, and the all-new 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe. While the Montero Sport won’t be the newest or freshest competitor in this market, it will remain to be the best-priced and best-specified SUV in this market for years to come.

Police in 150 Chinese cities destroyed more than 100,000 illegal guns on Tuesday, as part of an ongoing crackdown that officials say is dramatically reducing gun-related crime across the country.

As Ministry of Public Security officials also prepared to dispose of a further 250 tons of illegal explosives in the next few days, Vice-Minister of Public Security Huang Ming said the incidence of both crimes has been declining rapidly.

Gun-related crime has fallen 46 percent year-on-year, while the number of explosive crime has also dropped by 39 percent, according to the ministry.

A large portion of the guns destroyed on Tuesday were seized by police during raids, while others were handed in by citizens, police said.

Half of the guns were confiscated during the national campaign targeting illegal guns and explosives, which started in February and which continues until December.

So far, police have smashed more than 180 criminal organizations and detained 7,800 suspects involved in the illegal possession of guns and explosives in the crackdown.

Huang said gun-related crime poses a serious threat to public safety and strict control on firearms is essential to maintain public safety.

He added that many of the crimes being committed using firearms are closely connected to gangs, drug trafficking, gambling or other serious crime.

""Gun smuggling is serious at border areas, and one of the reasons contributing to rising levels of violent crime in these areas,"" he said.

In one particular joint initiative by police from China and the United States, 26 suspected gun smugglers were caught and 105 guns, a large quantity of gun parts, and at least 50,000 bullets were seized.

In Shanghai on Tuesday, the municipal police department destroyed nearly 8 tons of illegal guns and explosives. Steamrollers crushed 800 imitation guns, 300 guns and 2,200 knives.

""The public has shown great understanding and support for the campaign targeting illegal firearms. Most were handed over by people,"" said Yao Zhirong, deputy chief of Shanghai municipal public security bureau.

""China is currently one of the countries with the lowest incidences of firearms crimes, compared with many other countries,"" added Liu Shaowu, director of security management at the Ministry of Public Security.

In the United States, more than 30,000 residents are killed and another 200,000 were injured in firearm violence on average annually, he said.

Described as one of the Tube's 'biggest safety scares ever'

Passengers were forced to escape along the train tracks in the tunnels



Commuters were delayed for up to two hours

Thousands of commuters had their journeys thrown into chaos after blundering workmen flooded a Tube line with two million litres of water as they tried to fix a leaking pipe.

Hundreds of passengers were stranded for up to two hours yesterday, before having to escape along the tracks.



The chaos continued this morning, with the Central Line part-suspended and engineers desperately battling to reopen it for the evening rush hour.

One of London Underground’s biggest safety scares ever was caused by Thames Water engineers.



A senior Tube source said: 'We are usually to blame when things go wrong but this time we can put hand on heart and say, ""It wasn’t our fault guv"". It was 100 per cent down to Thames Water.



'This has caused one of the biggest safety scares ever. There was so much water pumping in that there were genuine concerns of a tunnel collapse or the water flooding along the tunnel and affecting other lines.'

The crisis happened between Stratford and Bow stations at 1.39pm yesterday as workmen were lifting a 24in main to try to plug a smaller leak.



But the above-ground pipe cracked, sending 440,000 gallons of pressurised water pouring down a ventilation shaft near Wick Lane.



Today the beleaguered utility firm, which has frequently attracted Transport for London’s anger for its 'pointless' and badly co-ordinated road- works, admitted responsibility for a 'tricky' operation going badly wrong.



A spokesman said: 'The pipe was encased in concrete and as the crew was working it broke.' Water from the burst caused signals to short-circuit and bring Central Line trains to a halt.

Thames Water, which boasts of its role as a supplier to the London Games this summer, now faces a multimillion-pound compensation bill after cars in streets and a housing estate near the Olympic Park were flooded.



Transport for London will also expect compensation after services this morning were suspended between Leytonstone and Stratford, causing massive overcrowding during the rush hour.

London Underground’s chief operating officer Howard Collins said the crisis was a 'nightmare scenario' for the Olympics, with just 50 days until the opening ceremony.

He said: 'As the person responsible for operational readiness, this is obviously something I do not want to happen during the time of the Olympics.'

One engineer told the Standard that water was flowing 'like Niagara Falls' onto the dual carriageway leading to the Blackwall Tunnel.

'I have never seen anything like it before,' he said. 'It was a massive incident. There was a river in the street.'

Cars parked in Wick Lane were flooded up to their bonnets, while a housing estate that has been earmarked for an anti-terrorist missile system was also affected.

Resident Neil Midgley, 43, said: 'The gym, swimming pool and car park were closed due to flooding.'



Tube passenger Kenneth Thurtell, 27, who was travelling from Holborn to Leytonstone, said: 'I spent four hours trying to get home. I felt suicidal, quite frankly. I can’t imagine what it’s going to be like during the Olympics.'



Jennifer Hazel, 38 — stranded at Mile End as she tried to get home to Leyton — said: 'If this is what happens when something goes wrong on a quiet day, then good luck during the Olympics.'



The Central line is one of two principal Tube routes for the Olympics, with the Jubilee, connecting London’s heart directly with the Stratford stadium.



Yesterday the Jubilee and Bakerloo lines each suffered two breakdowns, with the Jubilee suspended through central London. Two broken-down trains caused Victoria line delays.



Thames Water, which has been heavily criticised for causing roads gridlock with its lengthy repairs, said: 'We were doing exploratory work on the pipe in Wick Lane yesterday having identified it as a potential weak point on the network ahead of the Olympics.

'This is a 24-inch pipe which is more than 100 years old and when we dug down to investigate a suspected leak, the earth around the pipe moved causing it to burst.

Hundreds of residents evacuated after a landslide damaged the dam at a reservoir and threatened to wash away their village were continuing the clean-up today.

Just 36 hours after flash flooding hit Pennal, Gwynedd, there was a second shock as water began escaping through a crack in the dam.



If the barrier had been completely breached, water would have flowed into the River Sychan and cascaded down into the valley, swamping the village half a mile below.



Around 600 residents were moved to a leisure centre in nearby Machynlleth as police, firemen and engineers rushed to repair the stone wall at the disused quarry.



But today they were beginning to return home after the authorities carried out a controlled release of six million gallons of water which eased pressure on the wall.

Share this article Share The affected stretch of coastline in West Wales saw twice as much rain in 24 hours as it usually sees in the whole of June.

A number of rivers burst their banks as the stormwater flowed downstream. Among the worst affected areas were Talybont, Dol-y-bont, Llandre, and Penrhyncoch. It has now emerged that those left devastated by the flooding are to be helped by a special disaster fund. The clean up and insurance costs of the 'freak deluge' is expected to run into millions of pounds. Ceredigion County Council leader Ellen ap Gwynn said many people who had 'lost everything' were not insured, or were unable to get insurance for their riverside homes.

She said: 'The last 48 hours have been horrendous. The bottom of Talybont was like a big lake. It has been once in a 100 year event. I think now the full scale of the damage and loss is beginning to sink in.

'That is why Ceredigion County Council is setting up a disaster fund to help those who won’t receive a penny.

'The details are yet to be finalised, but I would urge the public to donate everything they can to help those who have lost everything.'

Rescuers helped people to safety at the Holiday Park and Riverside Caravan Park in Llandre, Mill House Caravan Park at Dol-y-bont, Sea Rivers caravan park, Ynyslas, and Glanlerry Caravan Park, near Borth.



Today, tourists who had been staying in the static caravans returned to their holiday homes to survey the damage.



Claire Brabbin, 41, who owns a caravan in The Riverside Holiday Park near Llandre, described watching Saturday’s flood on TV while at their home in Burton-On-Trent as horrific.



She said: 'We couldn’t believe what were seeing. It didn’t look recognisable. When we came back to examine the damage, the park looked like a war-zone. It is heartbreaking.'



Other holiday home owners said they may be unable to return in the future. Vir Aluwalia, 49, of Dudley, said: 'Replacing a caravan is not like doing the same for a car. I’m worried we’re only going to get a nominal fee via the insurance, which will not fully cover the caravan or its contents.'



Senior politicians, including Prime Minister David Cameron, paid tribute to those who helped with the rescue and clean-up efforts.

Flood damaged furniture and other bits and bobs were removed from their homes by residents in an attempt to salvage their homes following the floods The Environment Agency advised residents to be prepared for disruption from flooding across parts of northern England later today and southern England.

The centre of the drama in the early hours of Saturday was the Riverside caravan site in the village of Talybont – one of four holiday parks along the bank of the River Leri to be evacuated.

Some holidaymakers were pulled to safety on ropes, while a lifeboat crew got into difficulties and had to be rescued by an RAF helicopter.

Pennal, which lies on the southern fringe of the Snowdonia national park, was among the dozens of villages hit over the weekend by flooding estimated to have caused tens of millions of pounds in damage.

Homes on the northern edge of the village closest to the river were flooded on Saturday, ruining carpets and contents.

Then came the crack in the dam. Neil Lewis, 60, who lives in the centre of the village, said a section of mountainside had slid into the reservoir, and was thought to be blocking a drainage hole which allowed water to escape naturally.



Superintendent Andy Jenks-Gilbert said: ‘Should the wall be completely breached, the contents of the reservoir will go into the river which flows through Pennal.’



Last night, a controlled release of water from the reservoir was being carried out to lessen pressure on the dam.



North Wales Police said the procedure was successfully reducing the water level and it was hoped that residents would be able to return to their homes later in the night.

Gwyn Jones of North Wales Fire and Rescue Service told the BBC that a member of the public had called about his concerns over a reservoir on his land.



The decision to evacuate residents was based on the volume of water involved and the heightened risk from rain and debris coming down and making it an unstable structure.



The reservoir was not man made, but formed when a derelict quarry with accumulated slate waste formed a barrier for the water, which had built up over the years.



'There has been a build up, causing stress to that slag heap, and that is what is causing us concern, as a service,' he said yesterday.



But later he added: 'Over the course of the day, we’ve been able to undertake two releases of water from the reservoir. We were closely monitoring the level of the river, and everything was satisfactory after those two releases.



'Subsequently, contractors and the landowner have created a permanent channel in the reservoir which is allowing the water to dissipate naturally and at a steady rate.



'Based on that information and survey from specialist pump operators on the scene, we were able to give the advice through North Wales Police that residents were able to return to their homes.'

Paul Mott, senior forecaster with MeteoGroup, warned the next few weeks were likely to remain cool, with temperatures below the average June highs of 20C.

Because of the complex weather, there is still some uncertainty as to the locations most at risk of flooding, but the situation will continue to be closely monitored. In preparation, Environment Agency officers are out monitoring river levels, checking defences, and removing any blockages that may increase the risk of flooding. Care should be taken as driving conditions may be hazardous, and people should listen to traffic reports for advice and for any disruption locally, the spokesman said.

Clean-up continues at Riverside caravan park Clean-up operations at the Riverside caravan park, north of Aberystwyth, were continuing yesterday. At one part of the site, a large mound of rubble and chippings has formed - with gas canisters and a child's bike among the debris. Several balconies to a number of holiday homes have also been damaged, with many occupants on site wearing wellington boots as they began work. Among them was Burton-on-Trent mother Claire Brabbin, 41, who said: 'We travelled down after watching the coverage of the floods on the news. 'When we opened the door to our holiday home it was heartbreaking. It is covered inside in mud and dirt. We've been coming here for 10 years and never ever experienced anything like it.

Just beyond the shallow waters shown in this photograph was a fast-flowing newly-created river which prevented the four man volunteer team from reaching safety

'The damage is devastating because it's like a second home and we've put so much time and effort in.'

Fellow Riverside resident Vir Ahluwalia, of Dudley, said the morning of the flooding was a terrifying experience.

The 49-year-old was inside his holiday home with wife Susan and their seven-year-old granddaughter when they were awoken by their dog.

He said: 'When we opened the door we couldn't believe what we could see. It was like we were in the middle of a river. It was already at knee height at around 3am, and amazingly we managed to get the car to start and drive off before it got worse. I think had we left it another 10 minutes we would have had to be rescued.

'The water had risen by then to waist height. And this morning we've discovered one of our neighbours' static caravans has smashed into ours.

'It's really devastating because this place is like a home to us. What perhaps people don't realise is that it's not like replacing a car.

'We had taken a lot of time to personalise our caravan inside over the past six to seven years.'



Flood warnings remained in place for the River Rheidol and the River Teifi near Lampeter, as forecasters warned that Wales and the rest of the UK would see little respite from the wet weather.

But not all areas were hit by heavy rainfall. In Bewdley, Worcestershire, pictures showed two fields of red poppies blossoming beautifully under blue skies.

The fields are managed by Blackstone Farm Nature Reserve, which also sets aside acres for wildlife including nesting skylarks, insects and butterflies.

The Met Office issued the grim forecast that early signs suggested there would not be a return to sustained UK-wide sunny weather until the end of the month.

Elsewhere, windy conditions and wet weather saw travel chaos in other parts of Britain. In Ferndown, Dorset, a 70ft tree nearly killed workers Chris Lloyd and Billy Harwood when it crashed down on to their van as they set at traffic lights in difficult conditions.



Fire crews assessing the devastation in Wales yesterday said there had been 'mass scale damage to caravan parks and private dwellings throughout the area'.



Andy Francis, of Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service, told the BBC that danger remained from biohazards, sewerage and other contaminants which had entered the waters around flooded areas.

Mr Francis also warned anyone against attempting to drive through the flooded areas, as they could 'becoming a casualty and require rescue'.



The freak floods yesterday cut off villages and roads in Ceredigion, Mid-Wales, swamping holiday parks and residential streets and leaving some people trapped in upstairs rooms.



Paul Mott, senior forecaster with MeteoGroup, said in the 24 hours to 7am yesterday even more - an incredible 150mm (or 6in) - fell in the hills of central and eastern Ceredigion.

He said the average amount of rain for the whole month of June in that area is nearer just under three inches or (70mm). 'That's what's caused the problem, all the rainwater has funnelled into the rivers, causing flooding in river valleys,' he said.

Royal Air Force Sea King helicopters, inshore life boats and fire service rescue boats were called to the Riverside Caravan Park in Llandre, Bow Street, near Aberystwyth, one of the most severely-affected sites where 'numerous people' needed help.

Dramatic scenes even saw an RNLI rescue crew require airlifting themselves, after becoming stranded while attempting to save others from the torrents of water.

Holidaymakers were pulled to safety due to a 'heavy current of water running through the caravan park', according to the Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service.

Caravan residents told how they woke up in the middle of the night to see large parts of the site being submerged in water.

Katie Hughes, who had been in a caravan with her young children, told Sky News yesterday: 'The first we knew about it was at about 3.40am when we were woken up.

'There was water everywhere and parts of the caravan were almost completely underwater.

'I've never seen anything like this but everyone is pulling together. It is the entire caravan park that has become on big river.

'The water has come from the side of the river and has just taken everything in its way.'



The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said Milford Haven Coastguard were contacted by Dyfed Powys police at 4.30am on Saturday requesting assistance at a caravan park at the side of the River Lery near Borth.

Chief Inspector Robin Mason, of Dyfed Powys Police, said it was difficult to give an exact number of those rescued, but said he was 'aware of about 30 to 40 people evacuated from various places' and there were 'probably more'.

Stephen South, the owner of the Riverside Caravan Park, told how a crew from the Royal National Lifeboat Institution had attempted to evacuate residents, but ended up having to be airlifted themselves.

Mr South told the Daily Telegraph that an RAF Sea King helicopter which had been airlifting residents from static homes also had to save the inshore lifeboat crew.



He said: 'At 2am the river that runs alongside the site breached the banks. It gradually got worse and we have been evacuating people ever since.



'They launched the life boat to get people but the force of the water swept the lifeboat into one of the buildings.



'The last people to be rescued were the lifeboat crew.'



He told the BBC: 'When caravan parks have about 2ft of water, people have been able to make their own way in an orderly manner.



'Since dawn, a lot of people have decided to leave by their own accord.'



He said some people were trapped in buildings, but added: 'However, they are upstairs.



'We have emergency rescue teams in the area with inflatables and we are in the process of evacuating people.'



Aberystwyth and Borth Coastguard rescue teams were called out as well as the Borth RNLI inshore lifeboat.

A rescue helicopter was also requested and sent to the scene, the MCA said in a statement.

The rescue teams helped 20 people from their caravans, and two of them needed help from ambulance crews because of mobility difficulties.

The statement added there was concern for others at other caravan parks further down the river and coastguard rescue teams were deployed to them.

George Crumpler, Cambrian sector manager, said: 'We responded to the request for assistance and are evacuating those at risk with the help of the other emergency services.'

RAF search and rescue crew member Sergeant Dickie Myers told Sky News: 'We were airborne just after five o'clock, we were told there were floods in the area.



'We saw the river was fairly swollen, the water level was above car levels in some places, and up to the windows of static caravans.



'Thankfully there was an on scene coordinator from the coastguard.



'We did all we could, and when we left the area we felt we'd helped everybody that we could.'



Christine Roberts, from Dol-y-bont, was awoken by a neighbour and had only minutes to get out of her bungalow before being taken to a rescue centre.

She said: ‘My home is totally flooded – everything is gone, everything is ruined. We have nothing. The only clothes we have are what we’re standing up in.’

Fire chiefs said that the tide had peaked in some areas of Wales by yesterday afternoon. RNLI flood response manager Robin Goodlad said: ‘The rescue team have plenty of experience at dropping things at a moment’s notice to go out on rescues. But the scale and speed at which it has come together has been fantastic.’

Chief Inspector Robin Mason of Dyfed-Powys Police said that the numbers of those rescued would ‘probably run into the hundreds’ by the time that the full scale of the flooding had become clearer.



On Saturday night, David Cameron offered his ‘full support’ to all affected by the storms and passed on his thanks to the emergency services.

Elsewhere in Britain, organisers were forced to cancel an annual South Asian festival that regularly attracts over 100,000 visitors due to the bad weather.

The Bradford Mela, due to be held on Saturday, was cancelled for safety reasons after the park in which it is held became heavily waterlogged.

The free event, which combines markets, funfairs, food and drink, arts, music, dance and children's activities, has been held at Peel Park in Bradford since 1998.

A statement on Bradford District Council's website read: 'The council's events organiser and parks managers assessed conditions at Peel Park this morning and the heavily waterlogged ground conditions left them with no other option but to cancel the Mela for safety reasons.

'Council officers deemed the huge infrastructure of the Mela, which consists of stages, marquees, fairground rides and temporary buildings, could be compromised by the soft and shifting ground in Peel Park. The Mela was organised for Saturday June 9 from 12pm until 8pm.

Parno Graszt (""White Horse""), from the village of Paszab, has made its name known internationally as an authentic Hungarian Gypsy music ensemble.

Founded by Hungarian Serb musicians, Sondorgo tries to foster and preserve Southern Slavic music traditions, as found in various settlements in Hungary.

Hungary's Dance House Movement is recognized by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage. It impressed Mu Qian, in Budapest, who was there to visit a festival, and prompted him to reflect on China's musical traditions.

It is a typical Friday night at the Fono music club in Budapest. A traditional band plays with violin, koboz (lute) and flute, as hundreds of young Hungarians dance the evening away to quick beats, whirling and perspiring. ""Hungarian people keep their traditional folk music and dance well,"" says Laszlo Horvath, director of Fono club. ""Although many young people like to dance to electronic music, as elsewhere in the world, there are also many who really enjoy this kind of dance house.""

Tanchaz, which literally means ""dance house"" in Hungarian, is a casual folk dance event that has been popular in Hungarian cities since the 1970s.

Tanchaz draws on traditional folk music and dance from across Hungary and Transylvania (a region of Romania), and was recognized by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage in 2011.

""The Dance House Movement played an important role in the acceptance of village folk music in the urban environment,"" says Soma Salamon, a 22-year-old musician with the Fanfara Complexa band, which plays at many dance houses in Budapest.

""It's very important that our parents' generation learned folk music in the '70s and '80s. We learned from them, and now we can make our music.""

Using a variety of traditional instruments, like the shepherd's flute, Jew's harp and bagpipes, Fanfara Complexa plays folk music from the Carpathian basin, which is centered in Hungary but also encompasses parts of Serbia, Slovakia and Romania. Some of their works also have Balkan influences.

""My generation is more open, and we adopt different elements in our music, but it's not possible without knowledge of the authentic styles,"" Salamon says.

Fanfara Complexa and Buda Folk, another band that Salamon plays in, were both featured at From the Rill to the Ocean: Hungarian Folk and World Music Flow, a recent showcase festival in Budapest that presented 23 Hungarian acts.

Among them were not only traditional musicians but also bands like psychedelic rock group Fokatelep, Gypsy folk band Parno Graszt, DJ Suefo and the Dresch jazz quartet. All fuse roots music into their language.

Miklos Both, guitarist with Napra and FolkSide - two groups that performed at the festival - says he's more interested in learning traditional music and then creating something new. He went to the countryside to study fiddle, but after that he tried to infuse fiddle techniques into his electric guitar playing.

""Bela Bartok did the same thing. He collected a lot of Hungarian folk music, but he made new music inspired by what he got from traditional music,"" says Both, 29. ""That is a good direction.""

Both also draws inspiration from other countries' music. In 2011, he traveled in China for a month, and the experience led to Star Nest, his composition with FolkSide.

""When I was in a Chinese village, I heard a musician play the erhu (two-stringed fiddle). It was so beautiful and interesting for me, especially the crescendo,"" he says.

""After I came back, I sat down and played the guitar with this erhu crescendo feeling, and then I had this song.""

The blending of traditional and modern elements into a ""world music"" started in Hungary in the early 1980s, pioneered by such bands as Muzsikas, Kolinda and Makam.

""They were the first ones to create something new on the base of traditional Hungarian folk music,"" says Csaba Lokos, mastermind of From the Rill to the Ocean. ""Now, there are a lot more bands with traditional elements.""

Lokos, 54, started working in the domain of Hungarian folk and world music in the 1980s, with a state-run company. Now he has his own agency, CL Music, which represents several established Hungarian bands like Napra, Parno Graszt and Csik.

Lokos recalls that in the early 1990s, when Hungarian bands began to be exposed internationally after the political system changed, Hungarian music became exotic and trendy around the world, and bands like Muzsikas and Ando Drom toured successfully the globe.

Compared to the past, Hungarian musicians can travel abroad much more freely. But they have to compete with musicians from all over the world now, Lokos notes.

As new trends like Balkan brass Gypsy music and Latin electronica have emerged in the world music market, the enthusiasm for Hungarian music has declined in recent years.

That's why Lokos initiated From the Rill to the Ocean. Together with some music venues in Budapest like the A38, Akvarium Klub, Palace of Arts and Hungarian Heritage House, Lokos selected 22 acts that represent the Hungarian folk and world music scene to perform at the festival.

""We want to showcase a variety of Hungarian music through the event, from traditional folk to crossover but all with roots elements,"" he says.

Lokos invited a group of music professionals from all over the world to attend the festival, hoping to promote Hungarian music more widely. And he plans to organize the event annually.

""I'm quite sure we have a reserve for the next 10 years. This area of Hungarian music is very colorful and rich,"" he says.

""Hungarian music may not sound so exotic today, but we are still here.""","Fri, 08 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20120608/0023ae69624d113b9d8023.jpg,"['world', 'house', 'hungarian', 'bands', 'plays', 'band', 'traditional', 'unplugged', 'dance', 'folk', 'music']", 
31,31,FL-2012-000100-CHN,Courts more cautious on death case |Politics |chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-06/12/content_15494230.htm,"Percentage of overturned verdicts falls 'as review policy is working'

The percentage of death sentences being overturned by the Supreme People's Court has fallen sharply since 2007, due to tighter court procedures, Hu Yunteng, the top court's director of research, said.

There has been a steady decrease in the percentage over the last five years after the top judicial authority reinstated a review of all sentences carrying the death penalty.

Just 7 percent of cases ordering capital punishment were rejected last year, compared with 10 percent in 2010 and 14 percent in 2007, according to figures from the top court.

Hu declined to reveal how many people were executed annually, but said the total number was falling each year.

There had been a decrease last year in the number of people committing crimes punishable by death, such as murder, violent robbery, rape and kidnapping, he said.

""Courts have mastered uniform policy, including procedural and evidence norms, for cases in which the death penalty could be a possibility,"" Hu said.

Consequently, the number of death sentences overturned due, for example, to mistakes in gathering evidence were significantly lower, he said.

Sentences that were overturned were mostly due to procedural flaws, inappropriate sentences or crimes related to finance.

In February last year, the National People's Congress, the top legislature, removed 13 crimes that qualified for capital punishment, in the latest amendment to the Criminal Law. These crimes were non-violent or were primarily related to finance.

The revised amendment to another law, the Criminal Procedure Law, was passed by the top legislature in March and will take effect next year.

According to the amendment,the second trial of all cases that carried the death penalty should be heard at a court session.

On top of this, the Supreme People's Court will deliver the final ruling on whether to approve or reject death sentences passed by provincial-level courts.

Moreover, the top court will question defendants during the review session and listen to defense lawyers' opinions, subject to request.

The Supreme People's Procuratorate can also now put forward views for the top court.

""The revised draft embodies the policies of justice with mercy and makes sure a death penalty can only be imposed for the most heinous crimes,"" he said.

The Supreme People's Court on April 20 rejected the death sentence for former tycoon Wu Ying after questioning the defendant. Wu was convicted of illegally raising as much as 770 million yuan ($121 million) for investments.

While upholding the conviction and legitimacy of previous judicial proceedings, the court declined to approve the death sentence due to lack of evidence, and referred the case back to the high people's court in East China's Zhejiang province.

Wu was sentenced to death in 2009 by a local court in Jinhua, Zhejiang, for illegally raising funds. More than half of these funds were lost in failed investments.

Her case attracted widespread attention from the domestic and international media. Much of this focused on the difficulties facing private businesses trying to raise capital.

According to the top court, about 95 percent of death sentences approved in China are for serious crimes, such as homicide, robbery, serious injury, rape, drug trafficking and kidnapping.

Hu said the revised draft to the Criminal Procedure Law is the first to allow the top court to cross-examine defendants, as well as directly commute the death sentence.

Li Guifang, deputy director of the criminal defense department under the All China Lawyers Association, said the amendment has played an obvious role in fully protecting the human rights of suspects.

""During the review period, the top court can question the suspects and listen to their lawyers before making a final ruling,"" Li said.

While acknowledging the progress of the draft amendment, Li said he hoped that a possible step might see an appropriate application for death penalty cases.

""What's more, the top court should not only examine evidence, but issue regulations to better define serious crimes to ensure the death penalty can only be imposed for the most heinous crimes,"" he added.","Tue, 12 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20120612/0013729e48091140b70601.jpg,"['crimes', 'courts', 'supreme', 'court', 'death', 'law', 'cautious', 'sentences', 'peoples', 'penalty', 'case', 'overturned', 'review']",

Evacuations of 10 homes in Coal Creek in the Grey district were forced this morning due to flooding.



One house in McLeans Pit Rd was also evacuated.



Range Creek had burst its banks, affecting lower Cobden in Greymouth, but not affecting any houses, the Grey District Council said.



Surface flooding in the Grey district was receding, but motorists were advised to continue driving cautiously.



As of 3.30pm, the Grey River had reached four metres, but was not classed as being at risk of flooding.



River levels at Waipuna and Ahaura had both plateaued, the council said.



McLeans Pit Rd was likely to be closed for the rest of the day, but Mawhera Quay had reopened after firefighters secured the roof and front of a building that was at risk of collapse during strong winds.



The fire service received reports of a roof lifting off a house in Runanga, caused by strong winds.



Trees had also fallen over powerlines near Barrytown.



The road between Runanga and Greymouth was closed for much of the day, but reopened about 2.25pm.



In Murchison, firefighters were filling sandbags in cause of further flooding.



""They had a fair bit of water threatening properties this morning,"" a fire service spokesman said.



Civil Defence said 50 sandbags are in place, but flood waters appear to be receding.



Another 150 sandbags remain on standby.



Murchison experienced flooding on Fairfax and Hampden streets, affecting one commercial property, one residential property and the recreation centre.



The flooding has now cleared and is thought to have been a flash flood, caused by debris gathering in a local creek.



Civil Defence said the flooding is not likely to happen again unless there is a significant amount of rainfall.



Some minor remedial work will probably need to be carried out by local contractors.



Slips have been reported around Longford and hills in Murchison, but are not affecting roads, properties or waterways.



Mangles Valley Road, near Murchison, has been affected by slips. The road has been partially cleared and is passable but care is required.



Doughboy Rd has been cleared and reopened, but Blackwater Rd remains closed.



West Coast Regional Council planning and environment manager Mike Meehan said surface flooding seemed to be the main problem in the region, with most rain falling in coastal areas rather than on river catchments inland.



The Buller River was rising and it was being monitored, but its level was not causing concern yet.



He said the Grey River was ""not too high"" given the level of surface flooding around Greymouth.



It was possible a cut in the lagoon at Greymouth would be opened, allowing some flood waters to empty out to sea.



Rain had started falling yesterday afternoon, starting off light then becoming consistent overnight and intense earlier today.



Flooding has closed State Highway 6 between Inangahu and Inangahua Junction. The usual detour route for the area, Browns Creek Rd, has also closed.



Kidsfirst Kindergarten chief executive Sherryll Wilson said flooding had forced the closure of the Greymouth kindergarten as staff could not physically reach it.



Its other two West Coast centres, in Hokitika and Karoro, were open, but were likely to close early if it continued to rain, she said.","Wed, 06 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://static2.stuff.co.nz/1338941607/913/7051913.jpg,"['forces', 'greymouth', 'west', 'road', 'affecting', 'rd', 'reopened', 'sandbags', 'grey', 'evacuations', 'flooding', 'river', 'roof', 'coast']",

( Xinhua)

NEW YORK - US space shuttle Enterprise made its final landing Wednesday at New York City's Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum as it passed the Statue of Liberty, the World Trade Center site and other Manhattan landmarks.

The shuttle atop a barge started its sailing from Jersey City and arrived at the Intrepid around 11:45 a.m. Wednesday morning. It took four hours for the Enterprise to be hoisted by crane and lowered onto the flight deck of the Intrepid at around 4 p.m.. It will be open to the public in mid-July.

Hundreds of people lined the west side waterfront to welcome Enterprise accompanied by a flotilla of vessels including a police boat, a Fire Department boat and a yellow taxi boat.

It was very interesting, and took quite a long time, but very worth to wait. We've actually been on it when we went to Kennedy Space Center and had a look at it. So we're quite excited to see it here today,"" an English tourist named Sharon told Xinhua, who has been waiting for hours near Intrepid to witness the shuttle's final landing.

According to a statement by Intrepid museum officials, a wingtip of the shuttle was damaged slightly on Sunday during its transit from John F. Kennedy Airport to Weeks Marine in Jersey City, where it was held until Tuesday. It has since been repaired.

The shuttle was on display at a Smithsonian Institute museum in Washington D.C. before taking flight from Virginia's Dulles International Airport on April 27 and making its final flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport.

Completed in 1976, Enterprise was designed as a prototype test vehicle. Test pilots demonstrated that it could fly and land in the atmosphere like airplanes, but the Enterprise never flew in space.","Thu, 07 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20120607/002170196e1c113a346a0e.jpg,"['space', 'shuttle', 'intrepid', 'final', 'took', 'makes', 'museum', 'flight', 'kennedy', 'york', 'landing1', 'enterprise']",

Dunhuang My Dreamland, a classic produced by Lanzhou Opera House in 2000, will play in the Guangdong capital from June 16-17.

Mogao, a young painter, and Yueya, a princess, are the tragic lovers in this rendition of the story. But the princess' father goes against their relationship. The characters are named after Mogao Caves and Yueya Spring, two scenic spots in Dunhuang of Gansu province.

These places also tie back into the story, because in the dance's gloomy ending, the princess sacrifices her life for the painter and becomes the Yueya Spring. Mogao, the painter, creates the wall paintings in Mogao Caves with the spring's water as the ink.

Dancers express the emotions strongly with bold and unconstrained folk dancing from western China as well as through ballet and modern dance. Audiences will also see lifelike stage settings which present scenic spots in Dunhuang including Yueya Spring, Mogao Caves and the wall paintings in the cave.

The chief director of the dance drama is Chen Weiya, who also helmed the opening and closing ceremony of the Guangzhou Asian Games. Zhang Qianyi, a famous Chinese musician, is the composer.

These imbalances did not arise organically. They were encouraged by the United States' post-Cold War mania for financial deregulation, by Chinese social and monetary policies that forced people to save at punitively low interest rates and which set the exchange rate to exporters' advantage, and by European leaders' blindness to the risks of creating a monetary union without the equivalent political or fiscal unity. Together, this mix of misaligned policies gave rise to a highly liquid global financial system in which giant, multinational banks grew so large that they fueled fears of systemic collapse, leaving policymakers paralyzed by their ""Too Big to Fail"" status when the party ended.

After the crisis, governments paid lip service to correcting these imbalances. But other than a few token agreements at G20 summits, the opportunity for a re-balancing was squandered. In fact, what countries on either side of the imbalance did was to double down their bets on the old, flawed system.

China, faced with the sharp declines in its U.S. and European export markets and with the need to produce jobs for millions of annual new entrants into the labor force, fixed its exchange rate at an artificially weak level and unleashed even more of its financially repressed savers' money to fund an unprecedented construction boom. It built high-speed rail networks, office and housing towers, airports and other projects at a breakneck pace. Initially, this succeeded in rapidly restoring growth to the 10% levels China had become used to. But instead of re-balancing its economic model toward consumption-led growth, it made China dependent on an unstoppable treadmill of investment, a trend that perpetually raised the bar ever higher for the consumer-based society it planned to have in the future, whose spending would now have to rise even higher if all the empty apartments or bullet train seats were to be filled. In the end the speculative bubble scared Chinese authorities, as did an outbreak of inflation. So they eventually tightened monetary conditions by letting both the exchange rate and interest rates rise. This slowed the economy to the extent that the world is now worrying about a downturn in Chinese demand--especially foreign producers of the commodities with which China has fueled its construction boom.

China's balancing act wasn't helped by America's response to the crisis, either. The United States' inability to recover from the 2009 recession in the same way that it had rebounded from past recessions stemmed from both the giant overhang of debt left from the housing bubble and the abundance of cheap production options in China, which encouraged U.S. employers to try to recover lost profitability by shifting operations offshore in search of lower costs. It meant that Corporate America survived but also that more than 20 million Americans stayed unemployed or underemployed and that debt-laden households further curtailed the discretionary spending that's needed to drive America's consumption-dependent economy.","Tue, 05 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/static/b/theatlantic/img/lacroix-default-thumbnail.png,"['rise', 'chinese', 'rate', 'spending', 'recover', 'exchange', 'redux', 'united', '2009', 'global', 'china', 'monetary', 'states', 'meltdown']",

The government says the Gibe III dam will boost development, give access to power for many Ethiopians -- about half of the population -- currently living without it, and generate revenue from the export of electricity to the region.

The mud-coloured Omo River which snakes through green gorges, feeding lush vegetation and providing vital water to one of Ethiopia's most remote regions, will also power a contentious dam project.

The government says the Gibe III dam will boost development, give access to power for many Ethiopians -- about half of the population -- currently living without it, and generate revenue from the export of electricity to the region.

But with construction under way for Africa's highest dam at 243 metres (nearly 800 feet), critics say Ethiopia must also consider the environmental and social impact it will have on some 500,000 people living downstream and at Lake Turkana in neighbouring Kenya. Their livelihoods rely on the river.

""If they're going to build this huge hydro-power dam than it should be done in a way that benefits the people who are most affected,"" said David Turton, a senior research fellow at Oxford University's African Studies Centre.

The Omo River is over 700 kilometers (430 miles) long and supplies Lake Turkana with 80 percent of its water. It is a source of annual flooding for the agro-pastoralists living in the South Omo valley, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The completion of the dam in 2014, which will have a capacity of 1,870 megawatts, will regulate the river's flow and, according to the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo), offer a predictable water source for communities living along the river south of the dam.

Agro-pastoralists in Omo's valley have traditionally relied on flood-retreat agriculture for cultivation and animal grazing.

The mud-coloured Omo River in Ethiopia. Critics of the Gibe III dam say Ethiopia must consider the environmental and social impact it will have on some 500,000 people living downstream and at Lake Turkana in neighbouring Kenya, who rely on the river for their livelihood.

""Before, the wet season was two months, or maximum three months, then there was nine months of drought, now for 12 months there will be a regulated flow for all the downstream users,"" said EEPCo chief executive Mirhet Debebe.

The centuries-old flood-retreat agriculture practised by the downstream tribes is a cultural mainstay of the Bodi, Mursi and Nyangatom tribes, famed for their lip-plate and body painting customs.

But Azeb Aznake, Gibe III project manager at EEPCo, has said artificial flooding would be created annually ""so that their practice is not interrupted.""

She said the regular river flow would provide irrigation for small-scale cultivators downstream, and denied that the Gibe III dam would feed irrigation channels to nearby foreign-owned plantations, as some groups have charged.

""The purpose of the dam is for hydroelectric power, and nothing more,"" the power company executive said.

Most of the $1.8 billion (1.5 billion euro) cost of the project -- the third in a series of five dams planned along the Omo River -- will be covered by EEPCo, with a Chinese firm bankrolling the $400 million electromechanical costs.

Workers in an underground passage at the Gibe III dam construction site in Ethiopia's Omo valley. Over 4,000 Ethiopians have been hired to help build Gibe III, which was started in 2006 and is over 50 percent complete.

The dam has been mired in controversy from the project's inception and the ""Stop Gibe 3"" online petition has collected over 18,000 signatures.

EEPCo's Azeb admitted that any project of this magnitude is bound to have an impact on local communities and ecosystems, but said the overall benefits were too great to ignore.

""Water is our major resource.... We have to make use of it and develop, we have to eat three times a day like any human being, so there has to be compromise,"" she said.

Power generated by the dam will be fed to a main transmission and sold to neighbouring Djibouti -- which is already receiving Ethiopian power -- as well as Kenya, Sudan and Somaliland, providing a major source of income, CEO Mihret said.

For Frederic Mousseau, policy director at the US-based think tank Oakland Institute, which is opposed to the dam's construction, the benefits are not widespread enough.

""It's really about who benefits and what benefits.... At the macro level you might have increased exports, economic growth, but what about human development, what happens to the people?"" he said in a phone interview from California.

The controversial Gibe III dam under construction in Ethiopia's Omo valley. The completion of the dam in 2014 will regulate the river's flow and, according to the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation, offer a predictable water source for communities living along the river south of the dam.

He urged the Ethiopian government to halt the dam's construction ""so investment could go towards infrastructure that could really benefit the people.""

Some nearby residents welcome the job opportunities that have accompanied the dam's constructions. Over 4,000 Ethiopians have been hired to help build Gibe III, which was started in 2006 and is over 50 percent complete.

""It is good for our development and the area's development (because) we get more employment,"" said Mengistu Mara, 26, a student in Lala town about 30 kilometres away from Gibe III.

His brother who works as a crane operator at the dam pays Mengistu's school fees at the local high school, built in 2009 by the dam's contractors.

""I'm learning now because my brother is bringing me money,"" he said, standing in front of the school built near the village's newly paved road.

Lala resident Desalegn Barata, 41, also welcomed the job creation, but said that even with the construction site next door his community still has no clinic.

""There is no clinic or hospital and there are many diseases here,"" he said, swatting at the flies swarming around him in the midday heat.

For analyst Turton, the government should prioritise social justice as the project moves ahead, saying it is possible to balance the benefits with the potential impact.

""This is often presented as a choice between development and what we sometimes call cultural preservation, it's presented as sometimes you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs,"" he said, adding that he is not opposed to the construction of Gibe III.

""But it should be done in a way that shows a concern for social justice.""

Man of the match Ronaldo delivered the tournament's best individual display so far with goals in each half, after Rafael van der Vaart had raised Dutch hopes with a wonderful strike in the 11th minute, as they finished runners-up to Germany.

The Germans beat Denmark 2-1 in the other Group B game to finish with nine points ahead of Portugal on six, Denmark with three and the Dutch who had nothing to show for their efforts.

Portugal will now face the Czech Republic on Thursday in Warsaw while the Dutch will go home to lick their wounds.

There was no complaint about the outcome from a Netherlands team that two years ago were World Cup runners-up but this time around deserved their place among the tournament's 'also-rans'.

""I am responsible and therefore failed in this tournament but at this moment I am not thinking about my future,"" said Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk as the inquest began.

Like the Dutch, Ronaldo had come in for criticism but the winger's classy touches, electrifying pace and composed finishing proving to be the difference between the two teams.

For the Netherlands, their first exit from a tournament in the group stage since winning the European title in 1988 was all they deserved after three straight defeats.

Deserved win

While the Netherlands, among the pre-tournament favorites, will search for solutions to their massive under-achievement, Portugal have little time for reflection.

The Portuguese will prepare for the knockout phase, having recovered so well from their opening defeat by Germany.

""The win was entirely deserved as was the qualification. The players had quality, hard work, belief and confidence,"" said Portugal coach Paulo Bento.

""They showed this over the whole course. We proved that you can lose the first game and still qualify,"" he added.

Finishing second in the toughest group is testament to the impressive progress of Bento's team who significantly have been unchanged throughout the tournament.

The Dutch, in contrast, made three changes as Van Marwijk again searched in vain for the right formula.

His side had to deliver a two-goal victory to have a chance of squeezing into the last eight and Bundesliga top scorer Klaas-Jan Huntelaar got his first start of the tournament.

Van Marwijk's plans looked to have been justified by a confident opening 10 minutes, with smart possession play laying the foundations for Van der Vaart's glorious opener.

Arjen Robben cut in from the right and slipped the ball to the midfielder who superbly curled a left-foot shot inside the post beyond the reach of Rui Patricio for an 11th minute lead.

Yet the goal marked the high tide mark for the men in orange.

Ronaldo threat

Soon after, Ronaldo gave an early reminder of his threat on the counter, powering through before hitting the outside of the post with a low effort - a sign of things to come.

The Netherlands were surprisingly loose with possession and it was from a poor give-away by left-back Jetro Willems that Portugal equalized in the 28th minute.

Joao Pereira threaded a ball to Ronaldo who finished in characteristic style to send the teams in level at the break.

The Dutch tried to get back in front after the interval but it was Portugal who got the reward for their positive approach.

Ronaldo created chances for Fabio Coentrao and Nani but in the 74th minute he decided the outcome in impressive fashion.

Deep in his own half, the winger swung the ball out wide to Nani on the right who raced goalwards before looking up and finding Ronaldo in the area where he steadied himself before firing past Maarten Stekelenburg.

Luck was also against the Dutch when Van der Vaart hit the post with from 25 meters but the sight of Robin Van Persie and Huntelaar shooting wide in the final minutes was more symbolic.

Ronaldo was determined to complete his riposte to hasty critics with a hat-trick and nearly got his wish when in the final minute when he sprinted down the right, screaming for the ball, collected and struck the post with a left-foot shot.

A third goal would have been just reward for an outstanding display but cruel on the thousands of travelling Dutch fans who kindly applauded their team at the conclusion.

Whether many back home believe they deserved that generosity is likely to be fiercely debated in the days and weeks to come.","Mon, 18 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20120618/0022190dec451148cdbc61.jpg,"['dutch', 'right', 'answers', 'critics', 'dismal', 'ball', 'minute', 'ronaldo', 'portugal', 'van', 'group', 'netherlands', 'post']",

My China dream | Martha Makuena

Video: Laowai, NOT: Doing the 'African do' in China

China is indeed a land of opportunity, as Martha Makuena found out when she opened a hair salon for people of African origin, and she's now more comfortable here than at home. She shares her story with Yang Guang.

When Martha Makuena from the Congo first arrived in China, she was bored and listless. In 1999, her husband Paul Luyeye arrived in Wuhan to work, and she had followed him. In their community, they were the only foreigners, and Makuena spoke no Chinese and had no friends.

At the time, the Chinese made a clear distinction between laonei (Chinese) and laowai (foreigners), says Makuena, a fashion designer and hairstylist by training in her hometown Kinshasa.

""I felt completely like a laowai,"" the mother of three recalls.

Her two sons and a daughter were all born here. She certainly did not expect that, 13 years later, she would be the proud proprietor of a hair salon in Beijing that caters to people of African origin.

The shop in the Central Business District is the only of its kind in Beijing.

The road to success was long and hard. In 2003, Makuena had moved to Beijing with her husband and children because Luyeye changed jobs. To keep herself occupied, Makuena finished a year of studying Chinese and took another two years to finish a bachelor's degree in business administration.

She was surfing an online expatriate community chatroom when she saw an African woman asking about where to do her hair.

""African hair culture is a personal issue with a long and complex history,"" Makuena explains.

""I would say it is difficult for a Chinese hairdresser to meet the needs of an African or person of African descent insofar as hair is concerned.""

For instance, haircare products used by Africans, such as creams, oils and other kinds of treatment are different from those used by other people.

Makuena responded to that online request and was soon providing hairstyling services from home. Her customers quickly increased through word of mouth, and the group grew larger and larger.

When the family moved again to Suzhou in Jiangsu province in 2010 because of yet another job relocation, many of Makuena's customers followed. They came from Shanghai and Nanjing, and one even flew in from Chongqing.

Makuena has seen the size of the African community in China grow during her years in China, and she figures there are about 3,000 in Beijing alone.

That was the business opportunity, and Makuena and Luyeye started preparing for her hair salon in September last year.

""It was not that easy,"" says Luyeye says.

""It was as hard as any startup company in China. If it was easy, everyone would do it.""

Makuena went back to Kinshasa to recruit local hairdressers, and the salon opened its doors at the end of April this year.

Briton Nicola Thompson has been a loyal customer since she first knew Makuena from a friend four years ago. The 29-year-old teacher with an international school in Beijing says she trusts Makuena so much that she will not have her hair cut by anyone else.

""I kept asking when her salon would open, and finally it is here,"" Thompson says.

Prices for different services range from 40 yuan ($6.28) to 1,000 yuan. One of the most expensive services is for micro braids, which take at least eight hours to finish. For this, customers must go to the salon before 10:30 am.

Makuena's salon also attracts some Chinese customers.

Liu Rui, a Chinese sophomore at the Central Academy of Drama, had Makuena do his hair the African way because he says that suits his image as a part-time hip-hop singer.

Makuena now stays in Beijing to take care of her business while her husband and three children live in Suzhou. But she may get nearer to them soon, with her plans to start branches in Shanghai within this year and another in Guangzhou next year.

Having worked in the Congo, France and Canada, Luyeye says he feels there is no other country in the world that offers more opportunities than China. He adjusted easily to life here, following a piece of advice from his late father.

""Before my father died, he told me: 'My son, if you arrive at a place where you see everyone dancing with their left leg, you do the same thing. Don't think because you are special, you want to dance with the right leg.' I have always kept that in mind,"" he says.

That is probably why Luyeye makes it a house rule that the family must speak Chinese at home.

These days, Makuena's Chinese language skills have improved tremendously, along with her appetite for Chinese food.

The last time she went home to the Congo, she was excited to see a table of African dishes. But after a few bites, she did not want to eat anymore.

""It wasn't until I feasted at a Chinese restaurant that I realized I had finally found the food that belongs to me,"" she says.

""My family members joke that I had changed colors in my heart.""

What is CEPA?

The Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) is a free trade agreement between Chinese mainland and Hong Kong that offers Hong Kong products, companies and residents preferential access to the mainland market. To date, eight supplementary agreements to CEPA containing further concessions have been agreed by the two sides.

Objectives

1. Progressively reduce or eliminate tariffs and non-tariff barriers on substantially all the trade in goods between the two sides;

2. Progressively achieve liberalization of trade in services through reduction or elimination of substantially all discriminatory measures;

3. Promote trade and investment facilitation.

Trade in goods

Qualifying goods

All products of Hong Kong exported to Chinese mainland may enjoy tariff free treatment except for certain types of prohibited articles on condition that the products meet the prescribed rules of origin (ROO). For products falling under a large number of tariff codes, the ROO have already been determined. For products that to date have no agreed ROO, there exists a mechanism whereby interested enterprises may apply and request to include the products in subsequent phases of ROO discussions which will be held twice a year.

To qualify for duty free import, products must satisfy the ROO requirements. Under these requirements products are deemed to be of Hong Kong origin if they satisfy either of the following conditions: the products are obtained entirely in Hong Kong or the goods have undergone substantial transformation in Hong Kong.

Trade in services

Service sectors

CEPA provides for liberalised market access in a wide range of service sectors ahead of China's liberalisation schedule pursuant to its WTO obligations and facilitates the recognition of Hong Kong professional and technical qualifications. Under the most recent supplement, as from 1 April 2012, three new service sectors as well as 13 existing service sectors will be further liberalised. The total number of service sectors covered by CEPA will be expanded to 47 as follows:

• Accounting

• Patent agency

• Advertising

• Photographic

• Air transport

• Placement and supply services of personnel

• Audiovisual

• Printing

• Banking

• Public utility

• Building-cleaning

• Rail transport

• Computer and related services

• Real estate

• Construction and related engineering

• Related scientific and technical consulting services

• Convention and exhibition

• Research and development

• Cultural

• Road transport

• Distribution

• Securities and futures

• Environmental

• Services incidental to mining

• Examinations for professional and technical qualification

• Services related to management consulting

• Freight forwarding agency

• Services incidental to manufacturing

• Individually owned stores

• Social services

• Insurance

• Specialty design

• Interdisciplinary research and experimental development services

• Sporting

• Legal

• Storage and warehousing

• Library, archives, museums and other cultural services

• Technical testing, analysis and product testing

• Logistics

• Telecommunications

• Management consulting

• Tourism

• Maritime transport

• Trade mark agency

• Market research

• Translation and interpretation

• Medical

Benefits

The CEPA benefits in services are situated mainly in four areas:

• earlier market access: Hong Kong service suppliers can enter the PRC between one to five years earlier than under the WTO timetable;

• higher equity share: Hong Kong service suppliers are permitted to hold a higher equity share (in certain service sectors even up to 100%) in PRC service companies;

• lower capital thresholds: capital requirements to set up in the PRC have been reduced substantially thus opening up the field to smaller players; and

• recognition of Hong Kong qualifications: eligible Hong Kong residents are allowed to take qualification examinations for professionals and technicians in the Mainland in a wide range of specialisations and to obtain the relevant professional qualification certificates.

Trade and investment facilitation

The two sides agreed to further strengthen economic and trade cooperation through trade and investment facilitation in ten areas: trade and investment promotion; customs clearance facilitation; commodity inspection and quarantine, food safety, quality and standardisation; electronic business; transparency in laws and regulations; cooperation of small and medium enterprises; cooperation in industries; protection of intellectual property; cooperation on branding; and cooperation on education. Under CEPA VIII, the two sides agreed to further strengthen cooperation in commodity inspection and quarantine and food aspects. Further, the two sides agreed to strengthen collaboration in science and technology, and to support the establishment of a branch of the Chinese National Engineering Research Centre in Hong Kong as well as to set up a High-Tech Industrialization Base in Hong Kong.","Wed, 13 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/images/HK15th/attachement/jpg/site1/20120613/0023ae606e66114298a820.jpg,"['arrangement', 'mainland', 'hk', 'partnership', 'products', 'service', 'kong', 'closer', 'roo', 'hong', 'trade', 'sectors', 'services', 'cooperation', 'economic']",

The bad weather that has brought snow to much of the South Island has also resulted in the evacuation of eleven homes on the West Coast due to flooding fears.

Eleven homes at Coal Creek were evacuated this morning due to flooding, while storm-force winds and rain caused havoc in nearby Greymouth.

A family of nine was evacuated from their flooded home adjacent to the Camp overbridge, near Runanga this morning.

Water was 45cm deep through the property when the Runanga Volunteer Fire Brigade moved the Stollery family to higher ground.

Emergency services were called just before daybreak and the family was full of praise for the prompt response.

""The Runanga brigade was just awesome,'' Tamare Stollery, mother of six, said.

""I just got off the phone and they were here,'' daughter Sarah said. She was piggy-backed through the water by a fireman, and then up the bank to the highway.

""The little ones (aged two and four) were a bit upset, but they were soon cheered up with some lollies from the firemen,'' she said.

The family switched off the power to the house when they noticed water coming up through the floorboards.

They were keeping an eye on the water level about 4am as the rain was bucketing down, and soon decided to call the police.

The family had only moved a few weeks ago from Blackball to their new home at Coal Creek. Uninsured they had lost everything, including another family member's property that was stored in a garage.

The family was taken to the Runanga fire station, where they were given breakfast, and were later taken to stay with relatives on the Coast Road.

Meanwhile, near gale force winds lifted roofs in Greymouth, snow fell at Blackball and Jacksons, and Arthur's Pass was completely cut off in the first polar blast of winter. There were reports of sleet in Boddytown and Cobden, where floodwaters were also causing problems.

Ross, Harihari and Whataroa schools were all shut by high winds; in many cases the school buses could not get through, and the power supply was coming and going.

The Runanga Takeaways was the first call-out for the Cobden, Runanga and Greymouth fire brigades, when about 10cm of water went through the shop.

Bryan Blanch said they were open as a dairy this morning, but could not cook.

""We got flooded out from the creek next door, which blocked up. There's a lot of cleaning.''

Families and young children were evacuated to the Runanga fire station about 8.30am after severe flooding in Ward Street, Runanga, and around the Camp Creek overbridge, at Coal Creek.

Cobden fire chief Gary Pollock said that with water blocking access to homes in the McLeans Pit area, firefighters had to walk around the rear of the properties to help the owners carry their pets to safety.

Transport operator Cliff Sandrey said he used a loader to get Spring Creek miners across the flooded Coal Creek and back home again after their shift ended.

Other call-outs included to a window that was blown out in Bright Street. Flooding was particularly bad in Peel, Hall and Ward streets.

Grey District Mayor Tony Kokshoorn authorised contractors to open the 'cut' in Cobden, allowing backed up floodwaters to escape to sea.

Range Creek, running through the middle of the suburb, burst its banks.

Mr Kokshoorn said the water was about ""one foot under some houses'' and more rain was forecast.

""I'd rather be safe than sorry,'' he said.

In Greymouth, Kidsfirst Kingergarten in Shakespeare Street was closed, and the Greymouth Star lost part of its roof and a roller door buckled in the strong winds. Trampolines went flying _ including two in one street _ and Mawhera Quay was closed for a time while firemen secured the roof and frontage of an old second-hand shop, which threatened to collapse.

Grey District Council civil defence emergency manager Allan Wilson said they were worried about the parapet and were having it assessed.

Department of Conservation staff at Arthur's Pass said 15cm of snow had fallen overnight, and by mid-morning it was still snowing. With Porters Pass also shut, the alpine village was quiet this morning.

Ross School principal Shane Baillie, who lives nearer Hokitika, could not get past the weighbridge south of Ruatapu.

""There were trees down, the contractors were busy working on that,'' he said.

State highway 6 and the school were both shut at Inangahua Junction. By 9.30am the red marks at the top of the roadside pegs were all that were visible between the turnoff for the State highway and the village. It meant travellers could get from Reefton to Westport, but not Reefton to Murchison and Nelson.

Greymouth weather observer Phil Forrest recorded 147mm of rain in the 24 hours to 9am today. Kumara had 90mm by 7am.

The NZ Transport Agency was more hopeful of reopening Arthur's Pass at lunchtime, than it was of opening the Lewis.

""Our guys have been working through the night in continuous shifts. De-icing agent had been put down, which will help us to remove the snow,'' West Coast senior asset manager Mark Pinner said.

Further up the coast, fifty sandbags remain in place in Murchison, but flood waters appear to be receding, according to the Nelson Tasman Region Civil Defence and Emergency Management Group. Flooding on Faifax and Hampden streets affected one commercial property, one residential property and the recreation centre, however this has been cleared.

Civil Defence said there are also a few slips have been reported around Longford and hills in Murchison, but no roads or property is in danger.

In Nelson, Isel Park is closed due to windy conditions and the risk of falling tree branches. Tahunanui Reserve back beach is also closed due to storm tide debris and risk of falling tree branches.

Winds with gusts up to 130kmh are forecast to lash the Tasman region

Snow has been reported in Rappahannock, Matakitaki and Tophouse, but not at a level to cause concern. Korere-Tophouse Road was closed near Tophouse after a truck and trailer unit lost control in about 10-40mm of snow, blocking the road.

Snow blankets Canterbury

Snow continues to blanket the city of Christchurch and parts of Canterbury, causing much of the region to grind to a halt today.

Snow is still falling across much of Canterbury, including Hanmer Springs, Twizel, Burnham, Kirwee, and West Milton.

It's also fallen to ground level in Christchurch city with 10cm reported in the central city and up to 15-20cm out by the airport.

Christchurch Airport remains open, however flights have been delayed. A spokeswoman said runways are being cleared of snow and she advised passengers to check the status of their flights with individual airlines.

Approximately Orion 400 customers in parts of Harewood, West Melton and McLeans Island are without power due to the weather and a car collision with a power pole. The company says teams are working as quickly as possible to restore power.

Metro buses have had to alter routes in Christchurch due to the snow, with services stopping at the bottom of hill roads.

New Zealand Post has had to suspend the delivery of mail in Greymouth and its outlying areas, Rangiora and Kaiapoi, Ashburton and Christchurch, due to the weather. Delays are also expected to mail deliveries in Westport, Gore and Balclutha.

The following schools are closed: All Ashburton schools and preschools, Addington School, Darfield High School, Ellesmere College, Kaiapoi North School, Loburn School, Middleton Grange School, Oxford Area School, Rangiora High School, St Thomas Of Canterbury College, Taitapu School, Waiau School, Waitaha School, West Eyreton School, and West Melton School. Cashmere Primary has a delayed opening, with an update to be made at 10.30am.

The University of Canterbury was due to close at midday.

Dunedin airport flights resume

Flights at Dunedin airport have now resumed after 10 flights were cancelled this morning.

Dunedin International Airport chief John McCall says the cold blast caused significant disruption this morning.

He said operations had to be suspended entirely with significant black ice on the runway and disruptions to the national network causing five arrivals and five departures to cancel.

Mr McCall said the airport is now functioning but airlines will have a backlog of passengers to accommodate.

The city is experiencing its first real day of winter, but has missed out on heavy snowfall.

The Dunedin city centre is relatively snow free while the hills and outlying suburbs have borne the brunt of the cold blast.

Dunedin Police Senior Sergeant Bruce Ross said there had been a few minor traffic incidents mainly caused by black ice.

He says there was probably a late freeze, the temperature at 9am was minus 2 degrees, but has now warmed up to five degrees.

The Otago Regional Council suspended bus services on the hill areas this morning because of snow and ice, the services are now running.

No serious crashes

Canterbury District police communications manager Stephen Hill said there have been 13 motor accidents up until 12pm, none of them serious. In two of the accidents passengers suffered minor injuries, including one where a vehicle rolled onto its roof in Parklands.

A power pole was knocked over In an accident in West Melton, knocking out power to about 400 residents.

Mr Hill said most drivers appear to be heeding warnings and driving to conditions, or avoiding non-essential travel.

He said police have 10 four-wheel-drive vehicles available across the district and have hired another 12 to boost the ability to respond to incidents. The Four Wheel Drive Club is also assisting with staff transport, Mr Hill said.

Rough weather hits Wellington

The wind, rain and cold temperatures caused problems in Wellington overnight.

Trees were brought down in the capital and torrential rain caused extensive surface flooding.

Speed restrictions are in place, dropping to 80km/h on highways between Johnsonville and Wellington, and police are urging motorists to drive with extreme caution.

A spokesman for the Fire Service central communications centre said powerlines had been bought down in the Hutt Valley and Kilbirnie due to high winds, but crews had not been called out due to flooding.

Despite NZTA warning of possible surface flooding on Auckland's Northwestern and Northern motorways as a king tide hit about 8am, spokesman Ewart Barnsley said there was no flooding this morning and all the lanes were kept open.

The next king tide is expected at 9pm.

MetService warnings

MetService said a deep lower is expected to approach the upper South Island from the west this morning, then weaken slightly and pass east over the central North Island tonight.

A cold front, which is bringing heavy snow to Canterbury and parts of Marlborough and heavy rain to Westland, Buller, Nelson and the north of Marlborough, sits about Cook Strait and is expected to move north.

Heavy rain warnings are in place for Westland north of Hokitika, Buller, Nelson and Marlborough north of Seddon, with 80mm to 120mm forecast in the 18 hours from 6am.

MetService is also warning of strong winds - up to 130kmh in exposed areas - about Nelson, Buller and Westland.

A heavy snow warning is in place for Canterbury and Marlborough south of Seddon, with 50cm to 100cm of snow possible above 300 metres in the 18 hours from 6am, but 10 to 40cm south of about Lake Tekapo. Between 100m and 300m above sea level 15cm to 40cm may accumulate, but 40 to 60cm about Banks Peninsula.

MetService warned the heavy snow will make travelling difficult and cause stress for livestock.

The following State Highways are closed due to snow or flooding: SH65 (Shenandoah to Maruia), SH6 (Inangahua to Inangahua Junction), SH73 Arthurs Pass SH73 Porters Pass, SH6 Runanga to Greymouth and SH7 Lewis Pass. Updates on the status of state highways can be found here. The AA also have a list of road closures and restrictions here.

The misery is set to continue with the number of flood alerts soaring for southern England and Wales, with forecasters revealing there will be no respite from the rain over coming days.

The EA said there is a ""continued"" risk of surface water flooding from overwhelmed drains across parts of London, East and West Sussex, Surrey and Kent.

51 flood alerts have been issued across England and Wales and seven flood warnings - for:

River Ouzel at Leighton Buzzard

River Mole at Charlwood and Hookwood including Povey Cross Road and Gatwick Airport, West Sussex and Surrey

The Barnham Rife at Barnham, including the B2233, Lake Lane, Orchard Way, and Downview Road, West Sussex

The Aldingbourne and Lidsey Rifes at Felpham, including the Whitfield Close, the A259, Links Avenue, and Butlins Holiday Centre, West Sussex

River Colne in Colney Heath, Hertfordshire

Further flood alerts are expected for the South West later amid forecasts of torrential downpours in Torbay and South Devon. There are no severe flood warnings, the highest alert, which mean there is an immediate danger to life.

The flooding has already wreaked havoc across parts of the country, causing the closures of roads and a hospital.

Emergency cases at Worthing Hospital in West Sussex were diverted to neighbouring Brighton and Chichester for several hours overnight because of flooding.

ITV News' Lewis Vaughan Jones reports on the flooding:

Meanwhile, a special disaster fund is to be set up after more than 1,500 people were evacuated and 150 rescued in Mid Wales over the weekend.

Water up to five feet gushed through homes and businesses in Ceredigion, Powys and Gwynedd, with the clean-up and insurance costs expected to run into millions of pounds.

Nearby residents from the village of Pennal, near Machynlleth, Powys, mid Wales, were also evacuated last night following a breach in the dam of a quarry. They were taken to Machynlleth Leisure Centre and other temporary refuges.

The Environment Agency warned people to remain vigilant and check its website and Twitter feed for the latest situation. The agency added that the public was ""strongly"" advised to stay away from swollen rivers and not to drive through floodwater.","Mon, 11 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.ctfassets.net/pjshm78m9jt4/9402_header/421aaff0cd69964f74135a78517a9314/importedImage9402_header,"['alerts', 'west', 'rain', 'britain', 'heavy', 'sussex', 'agency', 'flood', 'way', 'wales', 'including', 'flooding', 'hits', 'south']",

But this year's annual gathering of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) should have been different. For a start, the airlines' umbrella group picked the most promising market to host the pow-wow, which was held in Beijing. Not only is air travel booming within and from China, but the country's airlines also made half of all global profits last year.

But as IATA delegates assembled for their gala dinner on June 11th at the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square, there was a ghost at the feast. The topic on most people's minds was not the dozens of airports to be opened this decade in China, nor the quarter of a trillion dollars the host country is spending to become an aviation and aerospace superpower. On the contrary, all eyes were focused on the spectre of financial chaos in Europe. The euro zone's troubles have already pushed many European carriers into the red. IATA predicts that there is a “serious risk” of bankruptcies. Indeed, Malev and Spainair, two fair-sized European airlines, have already gone bust. Several big airline groups, notably Air France-KLM, are trying to make deep cuts. The global industry's after-tax profits are forecast to fall from $7.9 billion in 2011 to $3 billion this year; that is just 0.5% of revenue (see chart). And if the euro collapses? “It would be worse than 9/11,” says Willie Walsh, the boss of IAG, which owns British Airways and Iberia. Things feel all the worse because 2012 might otherwise have been a good year. Oil prices have moderated of late. Global passenger traffic has risen by 6%, faster than the long-term trend. Freight contracted in 2011, but is reviving in many markets (though not Asia). Asset utilisation is 79%, up from 74% in 2009. Planes are relatively full, especially in America. That said, the industry faces three risks besides a European meltdown. First, an oil-supply shock—resulting from an Iranian crisis, say—would send fuel prices sharply up again and wipe out profits. Some airlines, including KLM, are investing in biofuels, but full commercialisation looks a decade away. Others use financial hedges, but these are pricey and can backfire if oil prices drop. Delta is even now finalising a deal to buy an oil refinery.

The second risk arises from the flood of new planes due to be delivered shortly. Production snags at both Airbus and Boeing have kept capacity tighter than planned. If everyone uses their new planes to expand capacity, rather than to replace clunkers, there could be a lot of empty seats.

The final threat pits ghost against host. The European Commission's inclusion of greenhouse gases from aviation in its emissions-trading scheme (ETS) is opposed by over 30 countries, of which China is the most defiant. If a compromise is not found, European countries must levy hefty fines on offenders and may seize aircraft—which could set off a trade war. On June 12th the China Air Transport Association, which represents Chinese carriers, said that China would retaliate with similar measures.

The Chinese government has forbidden its airlines from participating in the ETS. It has even threatened to cancel orders placed by its airlines with Airbus. No coincidence, then, that this week's banquet was paid for by the European aircraftmaker. The Chinese appear unbowed.","Sat, 16 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.economist.com/engassets/og-fallback-image.f1ea908894.png,"['host', 'planes', 'oil', 'air', 'iata', 'airlines', 'profits', 'china', 'prices', 'ghost', 'european', 'feast']",

“THERE are two kinds of people. Those that have read ""Ulysses"" and those that haven't,” my best friend stated plumply one day, dropping the surprisingly compact 783-page paperback on the table with a thud. This was meant in a silly, snobbish kind of way, but he was right. Given the flood of ecstatic imagination between the covers of James Joyce's novel, its more patient readers are marked for life by having read it.



Today, June 16th, is Bloomsday, the day in which all of the action of ""Ulysses"" takes place in the spinning clockwork of Dublin in 1904. Joyce's devoted fans can be seen celebrating it every year. While Bloomsday events outside of Dublin tend to be nerdy affairs in Edwardian dress, I do recommend a good public reading if you can find one. (I do not, on the other hand, recommend the Bloomsday Irish breakfast of kidneys and gizzards, which is positively Cronenberg-esque.)



Perhaps that breakfast is a good metaphor; some people, not happy with saying ""Ulysses"" is not to their taste, must pronounce it loathsome. It was banned in America until 1934 because of its “pornographic” nature, a comical artefact of the country's prudishness. And its position atop the western canon's modernist heap has made it an all-too-tempting target for critics. I'll never forget one of my old bosses damning ""Ulysses"" as the phallogocentric truncheon of paternal oppression, whatever that means. (He felt Gertrude Stein was the real talent.)



Just last year, Slate published a humourless piece in which Ron Rosenbaum fulminated about the book's shortcomings, or rather its overcomings: “'Ulysses' is an overwrought, overwritten epic of gratingly obvious, self-congratulatory, show-off erudition that, with its overstuffed symbolism and leaden attempts at humor, is bearable only by terminal graduate students who demand we validate the time they've wasted reading it.” Ouch. This is the kind of wet-blanket misinformation that you will have to ignore if you want to have any fun. And ""Ulysses"" is fun—maybe the best book you take to the beach this summer.



It is true that full-time literature students are in the best position to read ""Ulysses"": it's our job, with tons of time and a support staff standing by. I had the luxury of a ""Ulysses"" seminar with ten other undergrads, a professor with a Joyce tattoo on his back, and a pub with Beamish on tap. That's the ideal, but you really don't need all that. The beer is important, but all you really need is a clean, well-lit room of one's own, a copy of ""Ulysses"", Don Gifford's ""Ulysses Annotated"", Harry Blamires's ""The New Bloomsday Book"" for chapter summaries, Joseph Campbell for some colour commentary, and some spare time.



Many readers will recoil: “I have to read three other books to read this one book? Zounds!” Trust me: you'll be glad you did. Joyce is allusive and experimental, and the helping books do indeed help the reader mine for historical and literary meanings that reward often. But even a reader who forgoes annotated help can enjoy Joyce's virtuosity. Few novelists have the ability to make the English language do whatever he wants, to make it do cartwheels and sing arias. Even when Joyce goes down (yet another) digressive rabbit hole, you love being along for the ride.","Sat, 16 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.economist.com/engassets/og-fallback-image.f1ea908894.png,"['best', 'joyce', 'joyces', 'book', 'bloomsday', 'recommend', 'ulysses', 'read', 'books', 'students']",

Can We Survive the New Golden Age of Oil?

For more photos of new energy powers, click here.

Just months after an enormous discovery of natural gas off the coast of Israel, a local company has reported another potentially big strike — an estimated 1.4 billion barrels of oil, in addition to more natural gas. The company, Israel Opportunity Energy Resources, says it will start drilling by the end of the year. All of a sudden, Israel has found itself a focus of the world’s hydrocarbon interest.

Energy experts are tittering about a prodigious new golden age of oil and gas in the Eastern Mediterranean, where Israel and Cyprus could become substantial oil and natural gas exporters, in addition to some other surprising places including French Guiana, Kenya, North Dakota, and Somalia. All in all, say increasingly mainstream projections, the world is moving into a period of petroleum abundance, and not the scarcity that most industry hands embraced just months ago. Plus, the United States, or at least North America, may be on the cusp of energy independence while OPEC’s days of über-influence are numbered.

What these experts have not said, however, is that while this new golden age may indeed shake up the currently rich and powerful and create new regional forces, it could also accelerate the swamping of the planet in melted Arctic ice. So much new oil may flood the market that crude and gasoline prices might moderate and lessen consumer incentives to economize. ""In the absence of U.S. leadership, I tend to agree with NASA’s James Hansen that it is ‘game over for the planet,’"" Peter Rutland, a professor at Wesleyan University, told me in an email exchange.

This unspoken flaw in the golden-age scenario suggests it might not unfold so smoothly. The projected turnaround of oil’s sagging fortunes may indeed herald economic salvation for the U.S. and global economies. But the environmental consequences could also trip up its full realization.

Hansen famously made his apocalyptic remark (and repeated it last month in the New York Times) while discussing Canadian plans to expand exports of Albertan oil sands to the United States through a new Keystone XL pipeline to the Texas Gulf coast. Significant as they are, however, the sands are only one component of the projected global flood of new oil. Excluded from his appraisal are millions of additional barrels per day expected in the next decade and beyond from North Dakota’s Bakken shale oil, plus the deep waters off Angola, Brazil, Ghana, the U.S. Gulf Coast, and elsewhere.

In that context, Hansen’s staunch opposition to Keystone resembles less a strong defensive position than the proverbial finger in the dike. Two weeks ago, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said that carbon dioxide emissions last year already neared an important line: the point at which the probability of global temperatures sticking to a maximum 2 degree Celsius rise above pre-Industrial Revolution levels dips below 50 percent. Carbon emissions reached a record 31.6 gigatons in 2011, just under the targeted 2017 maximum of 32.6 gigatons, the point at which the IEA wants emissions to start dropping. If the new oil finds are developed fully, you will instead ""blow through your emissions targets,"" says Frank Verrastro, director of energy and security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Intentionally or not, the golden-age scenario seems tailored for the current international political and economic landscape. In the United States, President Barack Obama’s administration is muddling along in climate change discussions, as emissions containment has been out of political favor since the 2009 congressional failure to pass cap-and-trade legislation. The Republican Party has by and large branded climate change a hoax, and Democrats barely discuss it. World leaders are due to gather in two weeks in Rio de Janeiro for the 20th anniversary of the first Earth Summit, the precursor to the landmark 1997 Kyoto talks on climate change. But Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have already sent their regrets. After the disappointment of 2009 Copenhagen climate change conference, they seem to have little stomach for another go at climate talks in an atmosphere of economic crisis and political dissonance. And in an election season, Obama hardly has the political strength to do much other than embrace the golden-age scenario.

The question now is whether the issue of global warming will remain marginalized in the United States and abroad for another year, or two, or three — or decades? The golden-age projections suggest a lengthier time frame. But the nature of cyclical politics argues differently. The accepted mainstream climate change science remains bruised but not demolished. And the absence of any detailed analysis of environmental risk from golden-age enthusiasts, as well as their frequently dismissive attitude toward the issue when it is raised, lends them a surreal political quality. By failing even to suggest how the forecast bonanza squares with exhaustive reporting of rising temperatures, the projections seem aspirational rather than objectively data-driven.

Where the oil-age theorists seem likely to experience almost no pushback is in the revolution in natural gas, with a flood of the fuel already flowing or on its way from Australia, Mozambique, Qatar, Tanzania, the United States, and elsewhere. In both China and the United States, this gas glut is leading utilities to convert coal-fired power plants to natural gas fueling, which burns far cleaner. ""We’re already seeing coal being pushed out due to low gas prices, which is undoubtedly having a positive impact on greenhouse gas emissions,"" says Paul Faeth, a senior fellow at CNA, a Washington think tank. Stacy VanDeveer, a professor at the University of New Hampshire, told me that both the gas and oil could be viewed as net positives by climate change groups to the degree that they serve as bridge fuels ""to a much more efficient and mostly renewable energy future.""

Ultimately, we can expect a middle ground — neither unfettered development of every hydrocarbon asset on the planet, nor a shackling of the most prized reserves in the service of climate change targets. John Hofmeister, former president of Shell Oil Co., is an unapologetic golden-age proponent, but also argues for emissions reductions. The cutbacks, he told me, must happen over multiple decades, and not faster — any quicker pace would invite a backlash.

""The proponents of dramatic reduction in greenhouse gases too soon and faster than economies can absorb will actually create a more severe and longer lasting and more difficult future for the environment because of the negative reaction they will create, leading to prolonged adherence to carbon fuels for political reasons,"" he says.

For the same reasons, the new golden age may be good, but not as great as the forecasters suggest.","Tue, 05 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/oil_ref6.jpg?w=625,"['survive', 'climate', 'goldenage', 'oil', 'emissions', 'political', 'united', 'gas', 'age', 'energy', 'states', 'golden', 'change']",

It was only in January that China's president declared that he wanted his police force to step up its military training and by the look of these photos his plan is already in place.



As they carry out drills in the muddy water, all the men of the People's Armed Police share the same look of determination to complete the notoriously gruelling training.



The tasks include pinning targets to the ground and twisting their hands behind their back as well as lifting a gigantic log as they sat in filthy water.

Endurance: The men yell out as they practice teamwork, lifting heavy logs in cold murky water

Hardcore training: The policeman line up and pine their targets down, pulling their hands behind their backs as they lay in the ground in the muddy training field

During the training day last month the men were all dressed in a matching camouflage uniform and hat as well as sporting brown, green and red face paint.

The People's Armed Police, is a part of China's armed forces and focuses on internal security.



It has 660,000 personnel, although some reports suggest the figure is higher.

They also have the politically sensitive role of guarding key government buildings, including the main leadership compound of Zhongnanhai in Beijing.

Uniform discipline: The trainees turn their heads to reveal their camouflaged faces during the drill

Set on task: The PAP's primary mission is internal security



Four months ago President Hu Jintao urged the Chinese People's Armed Police (PAP) to strengthen its ability to deal with its duties, as well as unexpected events and terrorism.

The PAPC should take practical actions to safeguard national unity and security, social harmony and stability, and people's happiness, said Hu, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC).

In Britain public order training for police is very different - level one, which is the highest level does not dictate officers must lie in muddy water, with their hands pinned behind their backs.

Stealth mission: The men climb with rifles in their arms through the assault course

Normal day at the office dear: The men practice drills at the muddy training session

Instead these officers train regularly and because of the highly physical demands of their role they must be able to run 1000 metres carrying a long shield in under six minutes whilst dressed in full protective equipment.

The shields carried by these officers are 5'6"" tall, 1'11"" wide and weigh 17lbs.

53,53,FL-2012-000100-CHN,Islamist militants taking advantage of chaos in Mali - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2012/06/13/world/africa/mali-chaos/index.html,"Story highlights The West African nation of Mali has been in political limbo since a coup in March

The coup was over the government's response to a Tuareg rebellion in the north

Now, rebels and Islamist militants are in control of several northern cities

There is concern that Mali could soon become a haven for terrorists

The town of Niafunke, on the banks of the River Niger, was made famous by the legendary Ali Farka Toure, one of a legion of great guitarists to emerge from Mali.

But nowadays, Niafunke is known as a battleground as Mali disintegrates and a mix of hard-line Salafi Islamists and ethnic Tuareg rebels tighten their grip on the northern two-thirds of the country.

Malik, an English teacher from the town, knows just how hard-line the new arrivals are. He said a friend was brutally beaten on a Niafunke street after Salafists caught him with a flask of alcohol in his pocket. Malik also enjoys beer, a cigarette and music -- all ""vices"" abhorred by the Salafists of a movement known as Ansar Dine -- so he fled.

His story is all too typical. Mali, traditionally a tolerant society, has become bitterly divided in the wake of a rebellion by the Tuareg, a nomadic people who inhabit the north of this country as well as areas of Niger, Libya, Burkina Faso and Algeria.

Niafunke was one of the initial towns the Tuareg attacked in January, sparking a coup by disgruntled Malian soldiers. The soldiers, running low on ammunition and food in the face of rapid rebel advances, abandoned their northern bases en masse. They felt that political elites in the far-off capital of Bamako had virtually abandoned them.

Into the chaos has stepped Ansar Dine, a Tuareg-led Islamist militant group whose primary objective is to impose sharia law in Mali, and an exodus of well-armed Tuareg from Libya, where many fought for Moammar Gadhafi. No longer welcome in post-Gadhafi Libya, these battle-hardened Tuareg fighters traversed Saharan pistes to return to their homeland in northern Mali, which is known as Azawad in their indigenous language.

The separatist National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, or MNLA, formally declared its independence from Mali in April, and last month it announced that had joined forces with Ansar Dine. The MNLA cooled to this alliance when the two could not agree on how it would share power, but Mali, one of Africa's poorest countries, is now in a state of protracted limbo.

And it's this uncertainty -- this messy, unpredictable war in a country known as Africa's crossroads -- that threatens the region and has created concern that northern Mali could become a new terrorist haven.

Stalemate of suspicion

Nearly 400 miles northeast of Bamako, along a winding, dusty highway dotted with spartan roadside villages, is the town of Sevaré. Malian security forces have erected a series of checkpoints around the town that amount to internal border crossings.

To travel farther north, toward rebel-held territory, invites extreme suspicion. Those on ancient, creaking buses bound for Gao or Timbuktu have their belongings meticulously pulled apart by cautious local police. At Sevaré's southern edge, passengers queue up in the stifling midday heat at a garbage-strewn checkpoint to press their case for heading into rebel-held lands. There is scant sympathy for their plight. After passing through the city, they are then subject to another checkpoint on its northern fringe.

Beyond Sevaré is the town of Konna, on the banks of the Niger. It is supposedly held by a dispirited mix of Malian troops, gendarmes, national guard and police. It is the last population center claimed to be in government hands. But Muhammed, a young Tuareg employed by a British nongovernmental organization, described Bamako's hold on Konna as more tenuous than the central government was admitting.

Douentza, 75 miles away, is now in the hands of the MNLA. The famed city of Timbuktu, not so long ago a popular tourist destination for adventurous Europeans, is now ruled by Ansar Dine. MNLA forces are more prevalent in Azawad's southern hinterlands, while the better-funded, better-equipped Ansar Dine is primarily in control of the cities. The Salafists have closed bars, attempted to ban smoking and forced women to wear veils in a bid to implement gender segregation.

Mousa, a multilingual art dealer from Timbuktu who has spent considerable time in the United States hawking the work of local Malian artisans, made a hurried departure well before the rebel takeover. He went from doing a roaring trade with Western tourists to becoming an internal refugee in a matter of months.

""I left before the rebels entered the city,"" he said. ""After hearing about their attacks in the (far) north, I knew they would come (to Timbuktu)."" He now lives in uncertainty in a town near Sevaré.

Not all Tuaregs back the cause of an independent Azawad.

Zeidan ag Sidi Lamine, a former rebel now living in Bamako and part of the Malian government, said talks with the rebels were possible if it would accept the country's territorial integrity. He said Ansar Dine and the MNLA must accept ""that tolerance of religious difference is non-negotiable, and the nation's diversity must be preserved,"" respectively.

When asked whether he would he would be willing to take part in peace talks with either group, Sidi Lamine instantly responded, ""Of course I would accept."" But he believes that the self-declared ""Islamic State of Azawad"" is destined to unravel for two reasons: because the more nationalist MNLA did not consult the local population before declaring independence, and because it would be impossible for Ansar Dine to enforce sharia law over the long term due to Mali's inherent diversity.

Mousa, the art dealer, says that the revolt was partly motivated by another important factor and that it would not be easily undone.

""It is racism, plain and simple,"" he said. ""The Tuaregs do not want to be ruled by Bambaras, Fulanis or Songhais,"" three of Mali's principal peoples.

The reality driving this Tuareg revolt is more likely a complex hybrid of several factors, including ethnic nationalism, political isolation and a lack of economic opportunity. On top of that is the austere brand of Islam being espoused by Ansar Dine.

The military stalemate is compounded by political paralysis. Amadou Sanogo, the army captain who overthrew President Amadou Toumani Touré in March, had pledged to retake the embattled north. He has since technically stepped aside in favor of interim President Dioncounda Traore.

Traore, however, is in a Paris hotel after being beaten unconscious in a May 21 attack that occurred in the presidential palace. In Traore's absence, Mali is being effectively led by interim Prime Minister Cheick Modibo Diarra, a former NASA engineer who holds U.S. citizenship.

Diarra has hinted at trying to push the rebels back, and there are reports of troops being mobilized from southern garrisons to Sevaré, which could serve as a launch pad for a counterinsurgency campaign. But the town's threadbare garrisons suggest the army and gendarmerie would be ill-prepared to take the offensive. Only a handful of armored personal carriers and technical fighting trucks were evident. Most soldiers and gendarmes buzz around town on motor scooters more suited to running errands than fighting a war.

A magnet for jihadists

For the United States, the collapse of Mali poses multiple headaches beyond the humanitarian crisis that many have been striving to prevent. Its counterterrorism program here is in abeyance, just as al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa, and other freelance jihadists expand their presence.

Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has made millions of dollars through ransom payments for Western hostages. This money is thought to have been spent on a more sophisticated arsenal that may, according to some Western intelligence estimates, include ground-to-air missiles looted from Gadhafi's arsenals. While specifics regarding this more sophisticated weaponry remains speculative for the time being due to a dearth of verifiable intelligence in the Azawad region, what is known is that this sprawling, ungoverned area is becoming a magnet for regional and even transnational jihadists, according to several witnesses.

Basically, Mali remains in political freefall while quarrelsome rebels attempt to consolidate their control over an area the nearly the size of Texas.

After early efforts regarding a possible military intervention were rebuffed by Sanogo's junta, the West African regional body ECOWAS is taking the issue to the U.N. Security Council. Mahamadou Issoufou, the president of neighboring Niger -- a nation long plagued by its own Tuareg revolts -- has been sounding the alarm bell on the looming danger of jihadists controlling territory in Mali. Jean Ping, the chairman of the African Union, also plans to raise the Azawad issue at the U.N. in coming days.

Data collection and watershed modeling, resource assessments and supply forecasts, as well as flood preparations are top priorities for the U.S. Geological Survey, the federal government’s premiere water research agency, according to its draft 10-year strategy for water science, which was released on Monday.

Yet, despite their significance, some of these programs — especially data collection and monitoring — will see a cut in funding next fiscal year, if the U.S. Congress follows President Barack Obama’s budget proposal.

The agency’s water-science strategy is part of an internal reorganization that began in 2007. Seven new “mission areas”–natural hazards, ecosystems, and environmental health, for example–soon replaced the traditional departments, broken down into branches of sciences such as hydrology, geology, and biology. In turn, each mission area has produced a strategic plan, describing essential programs and goals.

USGS Water Strategy Goals Goal 1: Gather data nationwide on water quality and quantity in all parts of the hydrological cycle. Goal 2: Understand the processes that determine water availability. Goal 3: Predict changes in water quality and quantity due to climate change, population, and land use. Goal 4: Anticipate and respond to water-related emergencies and conflicts. Goal 5: Deliver timely hydrologic data and analysis to support water resources management.

“These strategies will guide science and technology investment and workforce and human capital strategies,” said USGS director Marcia McNutt in the forward to the water report. “They will inform our partners regarding opportunities for communication, collaboration, and coordination.”

The report’s introduction notes that the intended audience is the policymakers “who will determine the future resources with which the USGS has to conduct its work.”

The strategy, in other words, is both a statement of priorities and a guidebook for those who sign the checks.

The latter point is especially germane, considering the fiscal year 2013 budget that is making its way through Congress. In the president’s budget request, the only USGS mission area with a cut in funding is the water resources mission, facing a 2 percent decrease.

Some water programs will get more money, however. WaterSMART — a new inter-agency initiative to study national water availability — will see its coffers swell by $US 8 million, or by 62 percent. There is also more money for linking existing groundwater monitoring wells into a national network and for the National Streamflow Information Program, which targets monitoring sites deemed to be in the national interest.

But other basic data collection programs will fare much worse. Compared to spending in fiscal year 2011, the budget request cuts nearly 10 percent from the Cooperative Water Program, which operates streamflow gauges and does interpretive studies. Also stricken by more than 15 percent would be the National Water Quality Assessment, which monitors both surface and ground water quality.

During her testimony before a House subcommittee in March, USGS director McNutt said that the budget request “reflects difficult choices that had to be made in order to advance hydrologic science priorities.”

Federal Decline The Cooperative Water Program was conceived as an equal partnership between the USGS and state, local, and tribal agencies. Costs for monitoring stations would be shared 50-50. But Pixie Hamilton of the Cooperative Water Program told Circle of Blue that, because of less federal money, the partners are now picking up roughly 70 percent of the tab.

Pixie Hamilton, the national coordinator for the Cooperative Water Program, told Circle of Blue that the $US 5 million cut to her program would mean that up 1,300 monitoring stations — out of roughly 17,000 that measure streamflows, water quality, and groundwater levels — could be discontinued. The money, she said, is supposed to come out of the funds for interpretive studies, but monitoring often ends up eliminated in tandem.

“Even though the cuts are in the name of interpretation,” she said, “monitoring often gets cut. It’s difficult to separate assessments from monitoring.”

These data collection and water monitoring programs are vital, according to the National Academy of Science, which concluded in a 2009 evaluation that “sufficient funding should be provided for the USGS to perform its function as a major science agency: to ensure high quality data collection, interpretive programs, and development of essential forecasting and predictive tools to support effective management of the nation’s critical water resources.”

There is high demand for these products. The USGS gets more than 20 million requests per month for real-time streamflow data, which is used for everything from flood forecasting and climate modeling to highway planning, river management, and ecosystem protection. Scientists and researchers are especially keen for the standardized, high-quality measurements that are a hallmark of the USGS system.

“All this data is crucial for things that the Obama administration wants to do.” — Peter Evans, executive director

Interstate Council on Water Policy

That is why the cuts to data collection have frustrated Peter Evans, who argues that the agency should do more to protect its core strength. Evans has worked with officials in the last two presidential administrations in his role as the executive director of the Interstate Council on Water Policy, a network of state and regional water management agencies that seeks better coordination of state and federal water policies.

“All this data,” Evans told Circle of Blue, “is crucial for things that the Obama administration wants to do: restoration of the Everglades, the Chesapeake Bay, and the Great Lakes and conservation programs in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.”

Without a basic understanding of the physical resource, he says, the interpretive studies and the restoration projects may go off the rails. “Everyone seems to agree that the data USGS collects is essential, not only for federal agencies, but for state and local managers too. But time and again, the administration puts its money on different priorities.”

“Every country in the world is jealous of the USGS,” Evans said. “It’s the gold standard.”

The third animated ""Madagascar"" film stampeded past sci-fi thriller ""Prometheus"" to top US and Canadian box office charts with nearly $60.4 million in ticket sales over the weekend.

""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" also performed well in its debut in 28 international markets, bringing global ticket sales to $135.8 million in its opening weekend, according to distributor Paramount Pictures.

Anne Globe, chief marketing officer with the film's production company DreamWorks Animation, said the family-friendly movie attracted many young viewers with over a quarter of tickets sold for children under 12 years of age and more than half its total audiences comprised of viewers under 25.

The ""Madagascar"" franchise about the wacky misadventures of escaped zoo animals has grossed more than $1 billion around the world since the first film debuted in 2005.

Paramount had projected a $45 million U.S. and Canadian opening for ""Madagascar 3,"" and it roundly beat that forecast. But the new sequel's debut fell slightly short of the last ""Madagascar"" movie, which opened in November 2008 with $63 million from U.S. and Canadian theaters.

Still, it has received more critical praise than the previous two ""Madagascar"" films, racking up a 76-percent positive rating on critic aggregation site Rottentomatoes.com.

When asked about the possibility of a fourth installment in the series, Globe said DreamWorks was too busy enjoying its current success to give much thought to the future.

""It's too early to tell. There hasn't been a lot of discussion about that,"" she said.

In the new film, the animal pack joins a European traveling circus to try to get back to New York. Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith and David Schwimmer provide voices for the lead characters. The 3D movie cost $145 million to make.

""PROMETHEUS"" POWER

In second place, ""Prometheus"" starring Charlize Theron, pulled in $50 million. The 3D effects-filled film from ""Alien"" director Ridley Scott tells the story of a team of explorers who discover a clue to the origins of mankind. Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender also star.

Ahead of the weekend, Fox projected a $30 million domestic opening for ""Prometheus,"" which cost $130 million to produce.

Chris Aronson, executive vice president for domestic distribution at Fox, said he was surprised at the film's success.

""It's just blown away our expectations,"" he said, attributing the performance to ""word of mouth (publicity), a great film by Ridley Scott and a terrific (advertising) campaign.""

The film also garnered more female viewers than expected, Aronson added, with women filling 43 percent of theater seats.

""Prometheus"" opened overseas one week ago and picked up $39.2 million in international markets this weekend. The movie's global total ticket sales now stand at $141.5 million.

Last week's box office winner, action-filled ""Snow White and the Huntsman,"" slipped to third place with $23 million. The dark take on the classic fairy tale, also starring Theron, has pulled in $83.5 million around the world since its debut.

Rounding out the top five on domestic charts were the third ""Men in Black"" comedy, which took in $13.5 million, and Marvel superhero hit ""The Avengers,"" which brought in $10.8 million.

Republicans criticize the change as a political move that grants amnesty

Secretary Napolitano says the change is not amnesty or immunity

They must be successful students or have served in the military, with clean records

In an election-year policy change, the Obama administration said Friday it will stop deporting young illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children if they meet certain requirements.

The shift on the politically volatile issue of immigration policy prompted immediate praise from Latino leaders who have criticized Congress and the White House for inaction, while Republicans reacted with outrage, saying the move amounts to amnesty -- a negative buzz word among conservatives -- and usurps congressional authority.

Those who might benefit from the change expressed joy and relief, with celebratory demonstrations forming outside the White House and elsewhere.

Pedro Ramirez, a student who has campaigned for such a move, said he was ""definitely speechless,"" then added: ""It's great news.""

In a Rose Garden address Friday afternoon, President Barack Obama said the changes caused by his executive order will make immigration policy ""more fair, more efficient and more just.""

""This is not amnesty. This is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It's not a permanent fix,"" Obama said to take on conservative criticism of the step. ""This is a temporary stopgap measure.""

Noting children of illegal immigrants ""study in our schools, play in our neighborhoods, befriend our kids, pledge allegiance to our flag,"" Obama said, ""it makes no sense to expel talented young people who are, for all intents and purposes, Americans.""

When a reporter interrupted Obama with a hostile question, the president admonished him and declared that the policy change is ""the right thing to do.""

Under the new policy, people younger than 30 who came to the United States before the age of 16, pose no criminal or security threat, and were successful students or served in the military can get a two-year deferral from deportation, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said.

It also will allow those meeting the requirements to apply for work permits, Napolitano said, adding that participants must be in the United States now and be able to prove they have been living in the country continuously for at least five years.

The change is part of a department effort to target resources at illegal immigrants who pose a greater threat, such as criminals and those trying to enter the country now, Napolitano said, adding it was ""well within the framework of existing laws.""

The move addresses a major concern of the Hispanic community and mimics some of the provisions of a Democratic proposal called the DREAM Act that has failed to win enough Republican support to gain congressional approval.

Obama has been criticized by Hispanic-American leaders for an overall increase in deportations of illegal aliens in recent years. Last year, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed 396,906 illegal immigrants, the largest number in the agency's history.

Friday's policy change is expected to potentially affect 800,000 people, an administration official told CNN on background.

Both Obama and Napolitano called for Congress to pass the DREAM Act, which would put into law similar steps for children of illegal immigrants to continue living and working in the country.

""I've been dealing with immigration enforcement for 20 years and the plain fact of the matter is that the law that we're working under doesn't match the economic needs of the country today and the law enforcement needs of the country today,"" Napolitano told CNN. ""But as someone who is charged with enforcing the immigration system, we're setting good, strong, sensible priorities, and again these young people really are not the individuals that the immigration removal process was designed to focus upon.""

Republicans who have blocked Democratic efforts on immigration reform immediately condemned the move, with some calling it an improper maneuver to skirt congressional opposition.

Rep. Steve King of Iowa, a leading GOP foe of Democratic proposals for immigration reform, threatened to file a lawsuit asking the courts to stop Obama ""from implementing his unconstitutional and unlawful policy.""

In a Twitter post, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called the decision ""a classic Barack Obama move of choosing politics over leadership,"" while House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, called the change a ""decision to grant amnesty to potentially millions of illegal immigrants.""

""Many illegal immigrants will falsely claim they came here as children and the federal government has no way to check whether their claims are true,"" Smith said in a statement. ""And once these illegal immigrants are granted deferred action, they can then apply for a work permit, which the administration routinely grants 90% of the time.""

Others complained the move will flood an already poor job market for young Americans with illegal immigrants.

However, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who sponsored the DREAM Act, welcomed the announcement that he said ""will give these young immigrants their chance to come out of the shadows and be part of the only country they've ever called home.""

He rejected the GOP argument that Obama's move was all about politics, noting ""there will be those who vote against him because of this decision, too. That's what leadership is about.""

Durbin also noted that Obama repeatedly called for Congress to pass immigration reform legislation, including the DREAM Act. Now that it is clear no progress would occur this Congress, the president acted, Durbin said.

Obama has used executive orders more frequently in recent months to launch initiatives he advocates that have been stymied by the deep partisan divide in Congress. A White House campaign of such steps involving economic programs was labeled ""We Can't Wait.""

Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who has been working on an alternative version of the DREAM Act, criticized Obama for taking a piecemeal approach Friday. He said in a statement that ""by once again ignoring the Constitution and going around Congress, this short-term policy will make it harder to find a balanced and responsible long-term one.""

Rubio is considered a possible running mate for certain GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who rejected the DREAM Act in the heat of the Republican primary campaign but has since expressed willingness to consider whatever Rubio proposes.

Later Friday, Romney told reporters that the issue needs more substantive action than an executive order, which can be replaced by a subsequent president.

He said he agrees with Rubio's statement that Obama's move makes finding a long-term solution more difficult. As president, Romney said, he would seek to provide ""certainty and clarity for people who come into this country through no fault of their own by virtue of the actions of their parents.""

Hispanics make up the fastest-growing immigrant population in the country, and the Latino vote is considered a crucial bloc for the November presidential election.

A spokeswoman for a major Latino group, the National Council of La Raza, hailed the administration's move.

""In light of the congressional inaction on immigration reform, this is the right step for the administration to take at this time,"" said NCLR spokeswoman Laura Vazquez.

Immigration lawyers also called the change a major step in the right direction. However, one immigration expert warned that the new policy does not guarantee the result sought by participants.

""I worry that the announcement will be implemented more stingily than the administration would like,"" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, who teaches immigration law at Cornell Law School.

Meanwhile, some evangelical Christian leaders who recently met at the White House to discuss immigration issues also endorsed Friday's move, along with the U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops and some Jewish groups.

For Jose Luis Zelaya, who came to the United States illegally from Honduras at age 14 to find his mother, also an illegal immigrant, the new policy means that ""maybe I will be able to work without being afraid that someone may deport me.""

""There is no fear anymore,"" he said.","Sat, 16 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120615073554-bts-obama-explains-deportation-policy-00000704-story-top.jpg,"['policy', 'young', 'change', 'dream', 'administration', 'called', 'napolitano', 'obama', 'immigrants', 'illegal', 'country', 'stop', 'deporting', 'immigration']",

The successor to the United Nations' 1992 Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, Rio+20 begins on June 20. With it comes a major opportunity for the world's nations to take stock of where we are in our collective headlong rush toward global bust.

And what does the science say?

The cultural changes necessary to reduce birth rates have begun to take hold, but the world's population is still projected to reach 9.5 billion by 2050. Very little progress has been made in reducing consumption, and the developed world's lifestyle in particular will need to be drastically scaled back. Loss of biodiversity threatens to worsen the situation for ecosystems and human societies alike. And translating these findings into policy may be the greatest challenge researchers face.

""Just telling the people what the science says hasn't brought about the changes we need,"" Ehrlich said.

Population pressure

Humans are already above the planet's carrying capacity – the population size Earth can sustainably support. The scene in 40 years is, predictably, even grimmer.

""Even with people going hungry and living in ways that Americans aren't used to, we'd need another half an Earth to maintain just today's population indefinitely,"" according to Ehrlich.

There are, however, encouraging increases in gender equity, particularly in access of girls and women to education, jobs, credit, health care and family planning. Through these social changes, average fertility rates in developing countries have fallen from six to three births per woman over the past 40 years.

""Intimate personal decisions and cultural traditions have changed at the speed of light,"" said Daily.

Addressing the existing unmet demand for contraception among women in the developing world remains a promising way to reduce fertility rates. Estimates suggest that simply making contraception available could prevent over 20 million births annually, while also reducing maternal mortality and the need for unsafe abortions.

Educating women in the developing world could bring about an even greater change. The authors point to a paper in Science that predicted a global education effort would reduce the Earth's 2050 population by 1 billion.

Such a campaign would also further improve gender equity – an issue with a special relationship to sustainability. Growing evidence suggests women in the developing world are disproportionately affected by environmental degradation (e.g., of water and fuel supplies, and of land productivity), and that women worldwide are more invested in environmental causes. Controlling for other factors, the political status of women in a country is directly correlated to its success in reducing dangerous emissions.

The consumption bomb

The question of consumption has proven a much more intractable, and more urgent, issue.

""If we don't get off the fossil fuel standard,"" said Ehrlich, ""it hardly matters how many people there are.""

Although the developing world contains approximately 80 percent of the world's population, the developed world's environmental impact is much larger. Based on energy consumption, the average impact of an inhabitant of a developed country is 2 to 14 times that of a person in the developing world.

This global inequity is itself cause for concern, the authors say. Unequal wealth distribution may create ""flashpoints for ecological and human disaster"" – developing nations that will have the fewest resources to deal with climate stress and other environmental pressures.

Global life support

Although biodiversity is often thought of as merely an indicator of ecosystem health, it's also a critical component of an ecosystem's ability to support human well-being. In a second paper in this issue of Nature – a consensus statement by a large number of prominent environmental scientists – Daily points out that biodiversity loss may be as important a driver of ecological change as global warming.

Economic prosperity is dependent on what Daily calls ""natural capital."" Earth's lands, water and biodiversity provide a host of life-support benefits: ""Food and energy, water and climate security, jobs, recreation and inspiration.""

Some governments now acknowledge the economic value of these ecosystem services. China is implementing a new system of reserves, to span 25 percent of its land area, in which the government will invest in conservation efforts such as reforestation. In return, the reserves will improve flood and sandstorm control, hydropower production efficiency, water quality for irrigation and drinking supply, and climate stability.

In Latin America, water funds have become a popular way to invest in natural capital. Downstream water users – hydropower and bottling companies, agribusinesses and urban residents – pay upstream communities to secure water supplies.

""This involves shifting farming practices, restoring forests and forgoing some types of development in order to improve water quality, dry-season flow and security from flooding,"" said Daily.

The Natural Capital Project, an international partnership with a research engine at Stanford, is supporting these policies. With a software system called InVEST, users in China and Latin America can identify which conservation actions in which places will yield the highest return-on-investment for society.

More ""boundary institutions,"" which translate environmental science into policy, are also beginning to form. April saw the founding of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services – an agency that applies ecological findings on an international level. But the researchers say the field's profile is still too low for comfort.

""We need to scale back destructive human impacts – but in terms of good ideas and models of success, we need to scale up,"" said Daily.

""And it's not incremental over the next 40 years,"" added Ehrlich. ""It's right now that we need to move.""

62,62,FL-2012-000100-CHN,John Roberts Has Shanghaied Our Democracy - WBUR,https://www.wbur.org/news/2012/06/18/john-roberts-democracy,"The Roberts Court, aided by ineptitude by the government’s lawyer, converted it into an issue involving freedom of speech. The McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law stood in Roberts’ way and had to be dodged, which Roberts & Co. did.

Roberts’ role was detailed by Jeffrey Toobin, in a story in The New Yorker that revealed how the chief justice broadened the scope of the 2010 Citizens case. It began when a federal agency said a commercial organization could not run a cable TV “documentary” attacking Hillary Clinton right before an election.

Ever since the John Roberts Supreme Court issued its 5-4 ruling in the Citizens United case, a tidal wave of billions of dollars has poured into presidential campaigns and is beginning to flood into elections for Senate and Congress.

“Through artful questioning, [Justices] Alito, Kennedy, and Roberts had turned a fairly obscure case about campaign-finance reform into a battle over government censorship,” Toobin said. When the Roberts Court was done, with an assist from a lower federal court that relied on the Citizens finding, they had paved the way for unlimited giving by corporations and extremely wealthy individuals.

Roberts and his right-sided colleagues had created and unleashed a whole new, powerful, wealthy and unaccountable force in American politics, the super PAC.

After Newt Gingrich trounced Mitt Romney in the South Carolina primary, Romney’s super PAC swung into action. A media monitoring service found “a whopping 99 percent of the 3,276 ads paid for by the Romney campaign were deemed negative, while 100 percent of the 4,969 spots sponsored by the pro-Romney Restore Our Future PAC were considered negative.” Gingrich was never a serious threat again.

Nevertheless, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, and his wife, through their super PAC, gave Gingrich $20 million and pretty much single-handedly kept Newt’s political heart beating well past its expiration date.

Last week Forbes magazine reported, “Adelson just donated $10 million to Mitt Romney’s super PAC, and told Forbes he is willing to spend $100 million or more to ensure President Obama is not re-elected.”

That’s $100 million to defeat the president of the United States. Prior to Citizens, such an act was illegal and unthinkable.

Lately, two of Karl Rove-run groups have begun attacking Democrats in key Senate races. Rove, known as “George W. Bush’s brain,” launched TV attack ads worth $6 million into seven states to defeat Democrats. He’s just getting started. His groups aren’t technically super PACs. They are tax-exempt “social welfare” groups, such as the Rotary Club, which aren’t required to divulge their benefactors.

Super PACs are overwhelmingly Republican. Romney's Restore Our Future PAC has raised $57 million, more than six times as much as Obama’s Priorities USA. There’s more where that came from. Rolling Stone found the median income of donors to Romney’s super PAC is $1 billion.

Since Citizens, we have seen a handful of billionaires trying to buy control of our federal government. This shift of power to the monied few was made possible by what used to be the one branch of government that stood for justice for all.

Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, who was on the losing side of the Citizens decision, said recently that he expects the court has already had second thoughts about parts of its ruling that opened the floodgates to corporate spending in political campaigns.

But since the court doesn’t meet again to take up new cases until October, it’s unlikely to change what it has created in time for this year’s elections.","Mon, 18 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",http://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2012/06/0618_roberts.jpg,"['million', 'justice', 'romneys', 'pac', 'court', 'gingrich', 'super', 'shanghaied', 'groups', 'citizens', 'democracy', 'john', 'roberts']",

It's a foggy morning in half moon bay

, about 2 miles from the legendary Mavericks surf break just south of San Francisco. The parking lot is packed with 4x4 pickups and other mud-splattered vehicles outfitted with surfboard and bike racks. I'm led inside the GoPro headquarters by Rick Loughery, the company's steel-jawed director of communications, who's wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ""manufacturing stoke.""

We thread past a cube warren populated by twentysomethings dressed in the wrinkled cotton of passengers who just landed on the red-eye from Reykjavík (which some of the staffers very likely did). Duffel bags stuffed with outdoor gear crowd vacant desks while videographers stare into 27-inch monitors, editing footage captured at the most recent Winter X Games.

We weave our way to an office, where Nick Woodman, the 36-year-old founder and CEO of the upstart camera company, is double-fisting cans of Red Bull—his rocket fuel of choice—and watching a high-definition cavalcade of GoPro-sponsored athletes leaping out of airplanes, tumbling off mountains, plummeting over waterfalls, and diving into hot tubs on every continent. The frenetic action has been stitched into a promotional video for the company's latest creation, the $300 HD Hero2, the culmination of a decade's worth of tiny, armored cameras designed to be mounted on bike handlebars, snowboard helmets, and car hoods.

Woodman's distillation of the essence of the GoPro mission is equal parts corporate messaging and surferspeak: ""Our goal was to create a celebration of inspired humans doing rad stuff around the world."" In fact, Woodman is, to an extent, underselling the GoPro effect. The 8-year-old company not only has celebrated the antics of those inspired humans, it has also created a virtuous circle of video reinforcement that defines and motivates the culture of extreme sports. Woodman—a wave rider, race-car driver, mountain biker, and snowboarder—lives the lifestyle his indestructible cameras capture. He is proud that those cameras and accessories such as the new Wi-Fi BacPac, which adds remote capture and sharing features, form their own feedback loop that continuously adds functionality without stranding older equipment. The backward compatibility with cameras dating to the original HD Hero from 2009 keeps customers happy—and the Lego-like upgrades encourage people to buy deeper into the GoPro system. That resulting combination of customer enthusiasm and loyalty sold more than 800,000 cameras last year to users who then upload videos to YouTube once every 2 ½ minutes.

Woodman didn't set out to redefine the market for digital imaging. He just wanted to shoot decent surfing photos. In early 2002, after his games promotion company, Fun Bug, flamed out in the wake of the dot-com bust, he took off with his girlfriend (now wife), Jill, to surf-bum in Southeast Asia. The waves were world-class, and the art major from the University of California, San Diego, wanted to take high-quality action shots of his buddies on their boards. ""Surfing is such an incredible experience with a huge ego element,"" he says. ""'Did you see that wave? I got so barrelled! No? You didn't!'""

But unless you dragged a cameraman with a wide-angle lens into the tube with you, the best you could do was lash a disposable camera in waterproof housing to your arm with a rubber band. Woodman started thinking, what if I make a wrist strap with a mechanism that pivots the camera out of the way while I'm surfing, pop it up for the money shot, and then fold it down again? Between paddling out for sets in Sumatra and Java, he spent his time creating prototypes from old surf leashes.

When he and Jill returned to California in August 2002, they spent three months traveling the coast, living out of Woodman's 1974 VW bus and selling bead-and-shell belts they had picked up for $1.90 apiece in Indonesia as $60 fashion accessories at concerts and flea markets. With the profits and a $35,000 family loan, Woodman continued refining his prototypes on his mother's sewing machine, moving back home to save money.

There was just one problem: The straps worked fine but the technology didn't. ""Every camera I used would flood or break after a big wipeout,"" he says. ""I realized I shouldn't be a strap company, but a camera company.""

Woodman didn't seem to understand that switching from the sports-accessory industry to the consumer-electronics business (which is dominated by huge companies such as Sony, Canon, Nikon, and Panasonic) is akin to going from intramural hoops to an NBA tryout. ""Most businesses that enter categories like this don't bootstrap with one dude going to Starbucks every morning to, like, get himself pumped up for the day, saying, 'I am doing this!'"" Woodman says, laughing at his lack of a strategic plan, team, or money. ""Looking back on it, it's crazy that we've gotten to where we are now.""

Maybe not. It's unlikely that the HD Hero would have emerged from a digital-imaging company. The industry's leaders were busy trying to stuff more bells, whistles, and megapixels into shiny cameras for the masses. No matter how obsessively he looked, Woodman could not find a camera he could transform into a tough-as-nails rig that would work in any kind of action. ""I went to all the major camera shows, walking every aisle, and I'm maniacal,"" he says, ""When I say I looked at every booth, I looked at every booth twice.""







It took him two years to track down a Chinese company online that made an inexpensive, reusable camera for snorklers and was willing to modify the design to accept strap mounts. Woodman's original camera used 35-mm film even as the rest of the market was swiftly moving to digital. He couldn't afford it at the time. And since he didn't know how to render a 3D CAD model, he made an old-school prototype, using a Dremel tool, plastic blocks, and glue. He mailed it to China, wired $5000, and crossed his fingers. ""I had no idea if I was dealing with a real factory or a sham,"" he says.

It turned out the manufacturer was legit, and GoPro was in business. At an action-sports trade show in San Diego in 2004, the company landed its first customer: a Japanese distributor that ordered 100 cameras. (The celebration was tempered on the show's final night when Woodman's VW bus was stolen.) By 2005, GoPro still had only two employees—Nick and his buddy Neil Dana. In 2006, the firm came out with its first Digital Hero camera, and Woodman fulfilled a lifelong dream by enrolling in auto-racing school. He strapped a Digital Hero to the roll bar, but the punishing vibrations destroyed the camera's internal components and rattled the batteries off their connectors. The experience prompted a redesign that resulted in a product line that is essentially mil-spec.

The phenomenon that truly launched GoPro was a collision of good timing and lucky engineering. In the fall of 2006, Google bought a little company called YouTube, and by sheer dumb luck the 3-megapixel Digital Hero 3 with VGA video launched in spring 2007. ""The name-brand cameras at the time didn't shoot very good video,"" Woodman says. ""It was an afterthought, but within four months, the market had shifted. Our consumers and retailers went from asking, 'How's the photo quality?' for which we had an okay answer, to 'How's the video quality?' for which we had a great answer."" Thanks to YouTube, sales tripled that year and have continued at a similar pace ever since.

But taking high-quality video is only half the equation for GoPro's success. To make videos worth watching, a camera has to get where the action is. The Hero was designed to be a great camera for surfers, but it turns out the qualities of a good surf camera translate perfectly to other action sports. GoPros are small, light, and waterproof—and their signature wide, nearly fish-eye lenses seem to magically make subjects look, well, more heroic than they might otherwise be. That wide lens shoots your knees and skis, or your hands on the handlebars of a bike. The result is a big, immersive, ego-enhancing image. GoPro cameras are structurally designed to flip the traditional relationship of cameraman to subject, aligning it more closely with the way people shoot video in the YouTube era. The cameraman is the protagonist of his own video, and the lens stretches wide enough to fit in both him and the world he is conquering.

And now the professional crowd has grown to love Heroes. Emmy-winning cameraman Andy Casagrande IV has used them to capture everything from the inside of a shark's kisser to the inside of a lion pride. ""GoPro is revolutionizing wildlife filmmaking,"" he says. For Discovery Channel's Shark Week, Casagrande created the Bite Cam (two Heroes embedded in a foam decoy) to capture the perspective of a seal as it's being devoured. ""Before GoPro, no other cameras offered anywhere near the quality we needed. And since they're [relatively] cheap, the film industry treats them as nearly disposable cameras.""

Based on data supplied by its retail partners, GoPro estimates that it owns 90 percent of the rugged camera market, which is the place you want to be if you're trying to sell a device that records video. ""In a camcorder market that declined by 30 percent in the 12 months ending February 2012, the waterproof/rugged sector in which GoPro plays rose by 75 percent in revenue,"" says Liz Cutting, senior imaging analyst at NPD Group, a market research company.

To see how completely the com­pany dominates the rugged camera market and to understand its influence on action sports, search the term ""GoPro"" on YouTube. The result: clip after clip of awe-inspiring F/A-18 Hornet rides, avalanche cliff jumps, supercross ­races—all shot by users. (A search for ""Nikon"" produces page after page of product reviews.) This is no accident. GoPro employs a social media team charged with nurturing its customer base via daily giveaways and prominent exposure on GoPro.com, Facebook, and YouTube. What the com­pany seems to understand better than its competitors is that a customer showing off what he did with his Hero on YouTube is far more valuable than a clip of him talking about his camera.

Today Woodman and company cater to their fan base with an ever-increasing number of mounts for snow, skate, bike, moto, and virtually any sport in their adrenaline-fueled world. That's consistent with how Woodman sees GoPro, as the maker of exceed­ingly rugged building blocks that let cus­tomers invent how they shoot, not just what they shoot. Woodman—who wore head-mounted Heroes when his kids were born—imagines a surgeon using a custom capture device in the O.R. that riffs off something a kite surfer devised.

If it all sounds a bit far-fetched, consider that this vision is already playing out. The first step was the 3D Hero System—which uses the built-in Hero Port to combine two 2D cameras into a single 3D device. The new Wi-Fi BacPac allows a smartphone to monitor, control, and stream video from up to 50 cameras. It's all part of Woodman's passionate ""go big or go home"" mindset, which is at the core of the GoPro DNA. It's what inspires the brand's loyal users to shoot and share their most intense moments, and it may be the secret ingredient for the com­pany to outmaneuver Sony, Canon, and Apple in the not-too-distant future. ""You have to strive to be a top player or you shouldn't bother doing this in the first place,"" Woodman says. ""If you're just muddling along, you're going to get smoked.""

67,67,FL-2012-000100-CHN,Bringing Environment and Climate to the 2012 Population Association of America Annual Meeting - New Security Beat,https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2012/06/bringing-environment-and-climate-to-html/,"I followed as many of the environment-population discussions on newly published or prospective research papers as possible (about 20 in total). I found four papers particularly noteworthy for the connections made to women, family planning, and climate change adaptation.Samuel Codjoe of the University of Ghana spoke about adaptation to climate extremes in the Afram Plains during one of the population, health, and environment ( PHE ) panels organized by Population Action International . Although developed nations are historically the major contributors of greenhouse gases due to comparatively high levels of consumptions, developing countries are the most vulnerable to the consequences of climate change – in part because of continued population growth . As a result, adaptation strategies in countries like Ghana are particularly important; and given women’s often-outsized role in water and natural resource issues , a focus on gender-specific adaptation even more so.Codjoe presented an analysis of preferred adaptation strategies to flood and drought, broken down by gender and three common occupations – farming, fishing, and charcoal production). He said he hopes his assessment – part of a collaborative research effort with Lucy K.A. Adzoyi-Atidoh of Lincoln University – will aid in the selection and implementation of successful adaptation options for communities and households in the future.“Understanding differences in the priorities that women place on adaptation may prove to be important in the effectiveness of climate change adaptation – and the sustainability of communities,” he said.David López-Carr of the University of California, Santa Barbara , speaking on behalf of a group of researchers with World Wildlife Fund , teased out the gender dynamic further when he presented on ways to help the conservation sector determine next steps for existing PHE projects. Practitioners from seven of the eight PHE projects currently implemented by conservation organizations (defined by having been involved for at least three years in bringing family planning to local communities) recently said the links to women’s empowerment were among the most important aspects of successful projects.López-Carr therefore emphasized the need for additional research on how PHE projects can support and empower women, both economically and socially. He also noted, like Codjoe, the potential impact women often have on the management of their community’s natural resources, saying this was another area where research on the empowering effect of PHE programs can provide further backing for integrated programs Karen Hardee of Futures Group spoke about how the experiences of integrated PHE projects, despite most not being designed to respond to climate change specifically, have lessons to offer climate change efforts. Her work was done in partnership with the Population Reference Bureau , Population Action International, and U.S. Agency for International Development. She concluded that community-based adaptation approaches should consider population dynamics in vulnerability assessments. Meeting unmet need for family planning, she said, can assist communities adapting to climate change by building resilience. And as result, “PHE approaches should be able to qualify for funding under community-based adaptation programs.”Shah Md. Atiqul Haq of the City University of Hong Kong presented research he conducted in Bangladesh that found that women tended to feel that a large family size was not advantageous during floods. This, he said, was indicative of their increased understanding of vulnerability and an endorsement of providing knowledge and access to family planning services as part of climate change adaptation strategies.The inclusion of more environment, and particularly PHE, related presentations at this year’s conference was good to see – perhaps a sign that demography is becoming a more complex and comprehensive field , with a focus more on population structure and its interactions with other issues, rather than a singular fascination with growth.In particular, panelists showed that the nexus between demography, gender equity, and climate change continues to grow in importance, both in the research and practitioner communities.","Fri, 28 Aug 2015 07:43:45 GMT",https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/rural-women-300x212.jpg,"['research', 'climate', 'phe', 'communities', 'annual', 'adaptation', 'university', 'environment', 'meeting', 'association', 'america', 'family', 'women', 'population', 'change', 'bringing']",

Published Jun 15, 2012 9:02 PM

Chrishaun “CeCe” McDonald, a 24-year-old African-American transgender woman from Minneapolis, was sentenced June 4 to 41 months in prison for defending herself against a brutal attack by neofascists who verbally and physically assaulted McDonald and her friends outside a bar in June 2011. McDonald, who courageously defended herself and her friends against anti-trans, anti-woman, racist slurs and violence, was the only one arrested, charged and jailed at the time.

Protesters came out in downtown Minneapolis the evening of McDonald’s sentencing, on the eve of her transfer to the state prison system, and took to the streets to hold a “noise” demonstration in solidarity with McDonald and to demand her immediate freedom.

Leslie Feinberg, an award-winning author, transgender lesbian and beloved people’s warrior, was the only person arrested during the protest. Feinberg, who has publicly acknowledged that she is very ill with advanced Lyme disease, was held without bond for three nights in the Minneapolis jail and faced felony charges of property damage for allegedly spray painting “Free CeCe” on the outside walls of the county jail.

Because of a flood of outrage in the form of calls and emails to the prosecutor’s office, Feinberg’s arraignment and bail hearing were adjourned several times and finally cancelled. The felony charge was dismissed and Feinberg was released from jail.

On June 8, Feinberg issued a statement, which reads in part:

“The power of the people: felony charge dismissed before court hearing!

“The felony charge I faced was dismissed before court hearing this a.m. I may be recharged within weeks — or within the next three years — on misdemeanor/gross misdemeanor charges.

“If a month passes and I have not been recharged, … I will plan a trip here to South Minneapolis in order to take part in fundraising for CeCe and to offer our thanks to the ongoing work of the activist communities here.

‘It’s about freeing CeCe!’

“For media interviews, and other information about CeCe McDonald’s struggle, please contact her defense committee — not me. As I wrote in the media statement after my release from the county jail: ‘This arrest is not about me. It’s about keeping the focus on CeCe McDonald’s struggle!’

“If/when the state summons me back to Minnesota on new charges, I would demand a jury trial and use every court appearance to help keep the focus on the struggle for CeCe’s freedom.

“Over the summer, I plan to write a new introduction to the 20th-anniversary author’s edition of ‘Stone Butch Blues,’ which I drafted while inside the same jail that CeCe was being held in before transfer upstate.

“The prosecution wants the struggle to free CeCe to be over. But it’s far from over!

“FREE CECE!”

77,77,FL-2012-000100-CHN,'Beautiful Ruins' Takes Readers From 1960s Italy To Modern Day Hollywood - Here And Now,https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2012/06/13/beautiful-ruins-italy,"Twenty meters away, Pasquale Tursi watched the arrival of the woman as if in a dream. Or rather, he would think later, a dream’s opposite: a burst of clarity after a lifetime of sleep. Pasquale straightened and stopped what he was doing, what he was usually doing that spring, trying to construct a beach below his family’s empty pensione. Chest-deep in the cold Ligurian Sea, Pasquale was tossing rocks the size of cats in an attempt to fortify the breakwater, to keep the waves from hauling away his little mound of construction sand. Pasquale’s “beach” was only as wide as two fishing boats, and the ground beneath his dusting of sand was scalloped rock, but it was the closest thing to a flat piece of shoreline in the entire village: a rumor of a town that had ironically—or perhaps hopefully—been designated Porto despite the fact that the only boats to come in and out regularly belonged to the village’s handful of sardine and anchovy fishermen. The rest of the name, Vergogna, meant shame, and was a remnant from the founding of the village in the seventeenth century as a place for sailors and fishers to find women of . . .a certain moral and commercial flexibility.

On the day he first saw the lovely American, Pasquale was chest-deep in daydreams as well, imagining grubby little Porto Vergogna as an emergent resort town, and himself as a sophisticated businessman of the 1960s, a man of infinite possibility at the dawn of a glorious modernity. Everywhere he saw signs of il boom—the surge in wealth and literacy that was transforming Italy. Why not here? He’d recently come home from four years in bustling Florence, returning to the tiny backward village of his youth imagining that he brought vital news of the world out there—a glittering era of shiny macchine, of televisions and telephones, of double martinis and women in slender pants, of the kind of world that had seemed to exist before only in the cinema.

Porto Vergogna was a tight cluster of a dozen old whitewashed houses, an abandoned chapel, and the town’s only commercial interest—the tiny hotel and café owned by Pasquale’s family—all huddled like a herd of sleeping goats in a crease in the sheer cliffs. Behind the village, the rocks rose six hundred feet to a wall of black, striated mountains. Below it, the sea settled in a rocky, shrimp-curled cove, from which the fishermen put in and out every day. Isolated by the cliffs behind and the sea in front, the village had never been accessible by car or cart, and so the streets, such as they were, consisted of a few narrow pathways between the houses—brick-lined roads skinnier than sidewalks, plunging alleys and rising staircases so narrow that unless one was standing in the piazza San Pietro, the little town square, it was possible anywhere in the village to reach out and touch walls on either side.

In this way, remote Porto Vergogna was not so different from the quaint cliff-side towns of the Cinque Terre to the north, except that it was smaller, more remote, and not as picturesque. In fact, the hoteliers and restaurateurs to the north had their own pet name for the tiny village pinched into the vertical cliff seam: baldracca culo—the whore’s crack. Yet despite his neighbors’ disdain, Pasquale had come to believe, as his father had, that Porto Vergogna could someday flourish like the rest of the Levante, the coastline south of Genoa that included the Cinque Terre, or even the larger tourist cities on the Ponente—Portofino and the sophisticated Italian Riviera. The rare foreign tourists who boated or hiked into Porto Vergogna tended to be lost French or Swiss, but Pasquale held out hope the 1960s would bring a flood of Americans, led by the bravissimo U.S. president, John Kennedy, and his wife, Jacqueline. And yet, if his village had any chance of becoming the destinazione turistica primaria he dreamed of, Pasquale knew it would need to attract such vacationers, and to do that, it would need—first of all—a beach.

And so Pasquale stood half-submerged, holding a big rock beneath his chin as the red mahogany boat bobbed into his cove. His old friend Orenzio was piloting it for the wealthy vintner and hotelier Gualfredo, who ran the tourism south of Genoa but whose fancy ten-meter sport boat rarely came to Porto Vergogna. Pasquale watched the boat settle in its chop, and could think of nothing to do but call out, “Orenzio!” His friend was confused by the greeting; they had been friends since they were twelve, but they were not yellers, he and Pasquale, more . . . acknowledgers, lip-raisers, eyebrow-tippers. Orenzio nodded back grimly. He was serious when he had tourists in his boat, especially Americans. “They are serious people, Americans,” Orenzio had explained to Pasquale once. “Even more suspicious than Germans. If you smile too much, Americans assume you’re stealing from them.” Today Orenzio was especially dour-faced, shooting a glance toward the woman in the back of his boat, her long tan coat pulled tight around her thin waist, her floppy hat covering most of her face.

Then the woman said something quietly to Orenzio, and it carried across the water. Gibberish, Pasquale thought at first, until he recognized it as English—American, in fact: “Pardon me, what is that man doing?”

Pasquale knew his friend was insecure about his limited English and tended to answer questions in that awful language as tersely as possible. Orenzio glanced over at Pasquale, holding a big rock for the breakwater he was building, and attempted the English word for spiaggia—beach—saying with a hint of impatience: “Bitch.” The woman cocked her head as if she hadn’t heard right. Pasquale tried to help, muttering that the bitch was for the tourists, “per i turisti.” But the beautiful American didn’t seem to hear.

It was an inheritance from his father, Pasquale’s dream of tourism. Carlo Tursi had spent the last decade of his life trying to get the five larger villages of the Cinque Terre to accept Porto Vergogna as the sixth in the string. (“How much nicer,” he used to say, “Sei Terre, the six lands. Cinque Terre is so hard on tourists’ tongues.”) But tiny Porto Vergogna lacked the charm and political pull of its five larger neighbors. So while the five were connected by telephone lines and eventually by a tunneled rail line and swelled with seasonal tourists and their money, the sixth atrophied like an extra finger. Carlo’s other fruitless ambition had been to get those vital rail lines tunneled another kilometer, to link Porto Vergogna to the larger cliff-side towns. But this never happened, and since the nearest road cut behind the terraced vineyards that backed the Cinque Terre cliffs, Porto Vergogna remained cut off, alone in its wrinkle in the black, ribbed rocks, only the sea in front and steep foot-trails descending the cliffs behind.

On the day the luminous American arrived, Pasquale’s father had been dead for eight months. Carlo’s passing had been quick and quiet, a vessel bursting in his brain while he read one of his beloved newspapers. Over and over Pasquale replayed his father’s last ten minutes: he sipped an espresso, dragged a cigarette, laughed at an item in the Milan newspaper (Pasquale’s mother saved the page but never found anything funny in it), and then slumped forward as if he were napping. Pasquale was at the University of Florence when he got news of his father’s death. After the funeral, he begged his elderly mother to move to Florence, but the very idea scandalized her. “What kind of wife would I be if I left your father simply because he is dead?” It left no question—at least in Pasquale’s mind—that he must come home and care for his frail mother.

So Pasquale moved back into his old room in the hotel. And perhaps it was guilt over having dismissed his father’s ideas when he was younger, but Pasquale could suddenly see it—his family’s small inn—through newly inherited eyes. Yes, this town could become a new kind of Italian resort—an American getaway, parasols on the rocky shore, camera shutters snapping, Kennedys everywhere! And if there was a measure of self-interest in turning the empty pensione into a world-class resort, so be it: the old hotel was his only inheritance, the sole familial advantage in a culture that required it.

The hotel was comprised of a trattoria—a three-table café—a kitchen and two small apartments on the first floor, and the six rooms of the old brothel above it. With the hotel came the responsibility of caring for its only regular tenants, le due streghe, as the fishermen called them, the two witches: Pasquale’s crippled mother, Antonia, and her wire-haired sister, Valeria, the ogre who did most of the cooking when she wasn’t yelling at the lazy fishermen and the rare guest who stumbled in.

Pasquale was nothing if not tolerant, and he abided the eccentricities of his melodramatic mamma and his crazy zia just as he put up with the crude fishermen—each morning skidding their peschereccio down to the shoreline and pushing out into the sea, the small wooden shells rocking on the waves like dirty salad bowls, thrumming with the bup-bup of their smoking outboards. Each day the fishermen netted just enough anchovies, sardines, and sea bass to sell to the markets and restaurants to the south, before coming back to drink grappa and smoke the bitter cigarettes they rolled themselves. His father had always taken great pains to separate himself and his son—descendants, Carlo claimed, of an esteemed Florentine merchant class—from these coarse fishermen. “Look at them,” he would say to Pasquale from behind one of the many newspapers that arrived weekly on the mail boat. “In a more civilized time, they would have been our servants.”

Having lost two older sons in the war, Carlo wasn’t about to let his youngest son work on the fishing boats, or in the canneries in La Spezia, or in the terraced vineyards, or in the marble quarries in the Apennines, or anywhere else a young man might learn some valuable skill and shake the feeling that he was soft and out of place in the hard world. Instead, Carlo and Antonia—already forty when Pasquale was born—raised Pasquale like a secret between them, and it was only after some pleading that his aging parents had even allowed him to go to university in Florence.

When Pasquale returned after his father’s death, the fishermen were unsure what to think of him. At first, they attributed his strange behavior—always reading, talking to himself, measuring things, dumping bags of construction sand on the rocks and raking it like a vain man combing his last wisps of hair—to grief. They strung their nets and they watched the slender twenty-one-year-old rearrange rocks in hopes of keeping storms from hauling away his beach, and their eyes dewed over with memories of the empty dreams of their own dead fathers. But soon the fishermen began to miss the good-natured ribbing they’d always given Carlo Tursi.

Finally, after watching Pasquale work on his beach for a few weeks, the fishermen could stand it no longer. One day, Tomasso the Elder tossed the young man a matchbox and called out, “Here’s a chair for your tiny beach, Pasquale!” After weeks of unnatural kindness, the gentle mockery was a relief, the bursting of storm clouds above the village. Life was back to normal. “Pasquale, I saw part of your beach yesterday at Lerici. Shall I take the rest of the sand up there or will you wait for the current to deliver it?”

But a beach was something the fishermen could at least understand; after all, there were beaches in Monterosso al Mare and in the Riviera towns to the north, where the town’s fishermen sold the bulk of their catches. When Pasquale announced his intention to carve a tennis court into a cluster of boulders in the cliffs, however, the fishermen declared Pasquale even more unhinged than his father. “The boy has lost his sense,” they said from the small piazza as they hand-rolled cigarettes and watched Pasquale scamper over the boulders marking the boundaries of his future tennis court with string. “It’s a family of pazzi. Soon he’ll be talking to cats.” With nothing but steep cliff faces to work with, Pasquale knew that a golf course was out of the question. But there was a natural shelf of three boulders near his hotel, and if he could level the tops and cantilever the rest, he thought he could build forms and pour enough concrete to connect the boulders into a flat rectangle and create—like a vision rising out of the rocky cliffs—a tennis court, announcing to visitors arriving by sea that they had come upon a first-class resort. He could close his eyes and see it: men in clean white pants lobbing balls back and forth on a stunning court projecting out from the cliffs, a glorious shelf twenty meters above the shoreline, women in dresses and summer hats sipping drinks beneath nearby parasols. So he chipped away with a pick and chisels and hammers, hoping to prepare a large enough space for a tennis court. He raked his dusting of sand. He tossed rocks in the sea. He endured the teasing of the fishermen. He peeked in on his dying mother. And he waited—as he always had—for life to come and find him.

For eight months after his father’s death, this was the sum of Pasquale Tursi’s life. And if he wasn’t entirely happy, he wasn’t unhappy, either. Rather, he found himself inhabiting the vast, empty plateau where most people live, between boredom and contentment.

And perhaps this is where he would have always lived had not the beautiful American arrived on this cool, sunny afternoon, Pasquale standing chest-deep in the water twenty meters away, watching the mahogany boat come to rest against the wooden bollards of the pier, the woman standing in the stern, gentle wind ruffling the sea around her.

She was impossibly thin, and yet amply curved, the beautiful American. From Pasquale’s vantage in the sea—sun flickering behind her, wind snapping her wheat-blond hair—it was as if she were another species, taller and more ethereal than any woman he’d ever seen. Orenzio offered her a hand, and after a moment of hesitation she took it. He helped her from his boat onto the narrow pier.

“Thank you,” came an uncertain voice from beneath the hat, and then, “Grazie,” the Italian word breathy and unpracticed. She took her first step toward the village, seemed to stagger a moment, and then regained her balance. It was then that she pulled the hat off to get a look at the village, and Pasquale saw her full features and was mildly surprised the beautiful American wasn’t . . . well . . . more beautiful.

Oh, she was striking, certainly, but not in the way he’d expected. First, she was as tall as Pasquale, nearly six feet. And from where he stood, weren’t her features a bit too much for such a narrow face—plunging jawline so pronounced, mouth so full, eyes so round and open that she seemed startled? And could a woman be too thin, so that her curves seemed sudden, alarming? Her long hair was pulled back into a ponytail and her skin was lightly tanned, drawn tight over features that were somehow at once too sharp and too soft—nose too delicate for such a chin, for such high cheeks, for those big dark eyes. No, he thought, while she was striking, this was no great beauty.

But then she turned directly to him, and the disparate features of her drastic face came together as a single, perfect thing, and Pasquale recalled from his studies how some buildings in Florence could disappoint from various angles and yet always presented well in relief, always photographed well; that the various vantages were made to be composed; and so, too, he thought, some people. Then she smiled, and in that instant, if such a thing were possible, Pasquale fell in love, and he would remain in love for the rest of his life—not so much with the woman, whom he didn’t even know, but with the moment.

He dropped the rock he was holding.

78,78,FL-2012-000100-CHN,"Cleveland International Fund prepares to lend again, 4 months after founder's indictment - Plain Dealer",https://www.cleveland.com/business/2012/06/cleveland_international_fund.html,"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Four months after its founder was indicted in the spectacular collapse of an Eastlake credit union, the Cleveland International Fund is ready to start lending again.

Launched in 2010, the company found swift success pairing foreign investors with local real estate projects, including a $275 million office-and-hotel complex on the east bank of the Flats and the expansion of University Hospitals.

That run of achievements stalled in February, after Pepper Pike businessman A. Eddy Zai, who started the fund, was accused of playing a key role in one of the largest credit union failures in U.S. history.

The Cleveland International Fund, a participant in a federal immigrant investor program, was never part of that case. But it was stuck in the middle, as government officials pursued Zai's assets to recoup $16.7 million in allegedly fraudulent loans. A unique funding mechanism for Northeast Ohio projects could have been collateral damage in a criminal investigation.

Yet that didn't happen.

In a strange convergence -- a negotiation that every participant described as one of the most unusual things they've ever experienced - the fund's executives, the government and business leaders found a way to save the company.

An ownership change took Zai out of the mix. An independent review found no impropriety at the fund. The U.S. Attorney's Office, which could have seized money coming into the business, agreed instead to take payments intended to reimburse Zai for his former stake in the company. And a federal judge signed off on the deal.

Now the fund, which has amassed $105 million for Cleveland projects, hopes to raise money for a hotel overhaul in downtown Cleveland and the new American Greetings Corp. headquarters at Crocker Park. While waiting for a final sign-off from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the company's new owners are considering new Northeast Ohio developments and looking to draw investors from Latin America, South America and Europe.

The next year will demonstrate whether the Cleveland International Fund can shake the bad publicity associated with Zai, who pled not guilty to 34 counts of bank fraud and other crimes and is expected to stand trial in the fall. And the fund's coming achievements, or failures, could illustrate how much of the company's success sat with its public face, an immigrant entrepreneur who was, by turns, effusive and elusive, and how much of it hinged on the people working in the background.

""One of the questions we've dealt with across the board is 'Can you fundraise?'"" said Steve Strnisha, a well-connected financing expert who has worked with the fund since 2010 and recently became its chief executive officer. ""There was an impression that (Zai) did 100 percent of it. And, however that impression was developed, fortunately it was not the case.""

Since February, Kristen Laughlin has spent days on the phone with people in China, where most of the fund's investors live. The company's chief marketing officer, Laughlin found herself answering questions, stressing that investors' money is safe and explaining changes at the fund's offices in Pepper Pike. Some investors needed to vent, to share their feelings about broken trust. But other contacts, including overseas agents who recruit investors, just wanted to know when CiF will have another project ready.

Since February, only one investor has pulled out of the fund.

Program is 'a win-win-win,' borrowers say

Part of a little-known but increasingly popular federal visa program, the Cleveland International Fund offers wealthy foreign investors and their families a shot at U.S. residency if they put money into projects that create jobs in Cuyahoga County.

Cleveland International Fund

A private investment fund launched in 2010 as a federally approved regional center in the government's EB-5 immigrant investor program.

Run by Steve Strnisha, chief executive officer; Adam Blackman, chief operating officer; and Kristen Laughlin, chief marketing officer.

Employs 10 people at its Pepper Pike headquarters and has an office in China.

Covers Cuyahoga County and secures most of its investors in China. CiF hopes to expand its network of investors to Latin America, South America, other parts of southeast Asia and Europe. The company has looked at extending its investment area to more of Northeast Ohio.

Provides construction loans as part of the financing package for large real estate projects.

Raised $45 million for the Flats East Bank and $60 million for construction projects at University Hospitals.

Pledged more than $100 million for the redevelopment of the former Crowne Plaza hotel in downtown Cleveland as a Westin, the new American Greetings Corp. headquarters in Westlake and the expansion of Crocker Park.

The fund bundles money from dozens of investors into construction loans. In some cases, those loans are the only option to fill a financing gap that otherwise could scuttle a project. In other situations, the fund can offer lower-cost financing than competing lenders.

After all, these investors aren't expecting a hefty return. They want to get their money back, but the big payoff comes in the form of visas, access to U.S. health care and schools for their children.

""To a certain extent, it's a win-win-win,"" said Steve Smith, senior vice president and chief financial officer at American Greetings, which is still likely to use a CiF loan to build its headquarters. ""The investors get their residency privilege. The borrower gets the low cost of funds. And the community gets the benefit of job creation.""

The EB-5 immigrant investor program

Created in 1990, the EB-5 visa program attracted little attention until the financial crisis. Then banks and other traditional lenders shut off the spigot for construction projects. And developers were stuck, cash-strapped and casting about for money to keep their projects alive.

To feed demand for innovative financing, businesses like the Cleveland International Fund started popping up. Approved by the federal government and known as regional centers, these funds have multiplied from 11 in 2007 to 205 as of June 4.

The federal program lets foreign investors jump to the front of the line for green cards, if they put up cash and create at least 10 full-time U.S. jobs.

Critics view it as a mechanism for the wealthy to buy their way into the country. Skeptics raise concerns about whether the investments are happening in the right places and generating enough growth. Developers and businesses who have tapped the program say overseas money can keep a project alive or make it much more affordable.

In rural areas and markets with high unemployment, including Cuyahoga County, investors must put up $500,000 to be eligible for U.S. residency for themselves and their families. In less-stressed communities, the investment is $1 million.

The Cleveland fund it isn't the only regional center approved to do business in Ohio.

The CMB Summit LLC Regional Center started out in Summit County but now can do deals across the state, said Ky Boyle, executive director of CMB Regional Centers in Illinois. The center has been raising $104 million for Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.'s new headquarters in Akron and renovations of the old Goodyear complex and former Hoover Co. campus in North Canton.

In Wooster, the Northeast Ohio Regional Center does not work with investors. Instead, the group teaches businesses and developers about the EB-5 program and helps them navigate the approval process with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The center can operate in 16 counties but is still working on its first deal, to help a start-up medical-device company in Cleveland raise money, said Rod Crider, a board member and the president of the Wayne Economic Development Council.

Federal records show that another center, the Ohio Development Regional Center, is based in Greenville, northwest of Dayton. A representative for the center did not return phone calls.

That formula seemed to be working in Cleveland, even as some other regional investment centers struggled to line up investors or produce the required number of jobs.

Then Zai resigned, just before being charged in connection with the 2010 collapse of the St. Paul Croatian Federal Credit Union. And the fund's local supporters faced the prospect of scrapping a successful business and starting over, in an increasingly competitive international arena.

On Feb. 12, just days after the indictment, Adam Blackman bought Zai and his family's 90 percent stake in the company.

Blackman, the fund's chief operating officer, had worked there since January 2010 and already owned the remaining 10 percent of the business. The price for the rest: $22 million, in a note payable over 10 years, with low interest and no personal guarantees.

The federal government quickly laid claim to that note, to cover the credit-union loans. Then the government went one step further, going after payments coming into the fund from projects -- money needed to run the business. Without cash coming in, caught between Zai and the government, there was no way the fund could survive.

But federal officials were willing to talk to Strnisha and Blackman, who now jointly own the company.

""I've, candidly, found the situation that we're in a challenge,"" Strnisha said. ""I kind of get turned on by challenges.""

Late last month, the U.S. Attorney's office reached an unusual deal with the executives. Instead of paying Zai for his stake in the company, the fund will send the money to the federal government, which will put the cash in escrow until the credit-union case is resolved. The fund will have money to operate. And the government might get paid faster, Strnisha said, if the fund succeeds in finding new projects and recruiting investors.

""I personally have never had a situation like this,"" said U.S. Attorney Steven Dettelbach, whose office brought in Peter Raskind, the former leader of National City Corp. and a troubleshooter for the Cleveland school district and the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority, to evaluate the fund and vet the deal.

""I think it's important, as we do our jobs, to protect the victims' rights,"" Dettelbach added, ""but to do it in a way that protects the broader public interest. ... I'm not a real estate developer, but I'm told that in this time of tough financing, that this (fund) helps with downtown development. And all of us who live here want the Cleveland business community to have the same programs as competitors in any other city.""

Fund's leaders hope to tell new story

At the request of the fund's advisory board, executives hired law firm Jones Day and accounting firm Skoda Minotti to conduct an independent review. The companies scoured emails, sifted through documents and interviewed current and former fund employees.

In a April 2 letter to Strnisha and Blackman, Jones Day Partner Stephen Sozio wrote that the reviewers found no misconduct at the fund. And there was no evidence that investors' money was used improperly.

""It's unfortunate that there will always be some questions that the fund will have to answer, whether it's in the local market or foreign markets,"" said Baiju Shah, a member of the advisory board and the chief executive of BioEnterprise, a health care-focused nonprofit. ""It was very important to go through the process we've gone through and to make those findings available.""

That advisory board, which had no decision-making power, likely will disappear. The fund plans to establish a formal, five-member board of directors, according to a restructuring agreement filed in federal court. Strnisha and Blackman each expect to own 40 percent of the company. And they hope to sell a 20 percent stake to Cleveland Development Advisors, an affiliate of the nonprofit Greater Cleveland Partnership, the region's chamber of commerce.

Since 1989, CDA has invested $160 million in hard-to-finance real estate projects, many of them in Cleveland. If the organization agrees to take a stake in the Cleveland International Fund, it would control three board seats and could nudge the company toward investments in key community priorities. Business leaders say this ""civic embrace"" is necessary to demonstrate support for the fund. And it might help the fund in China, where investors value public-private partnerships and checks and balances.

CDA President Yvette Ittu said the organization will decide on its role within 30 to 45 days.

The fund's executives give credit to Zai for dreaming up the business and launching it at the right time, when demand for innovative financing was growing but the stream of new immigrant investment companies hadn't yet become a flood. But they're eager to move beyond the turmoil of the past few months, and to tell a new story -- about success in a region they believe can capture interest and investment on a global scale.

Reached by email, Zai declined to answer specific questions about the fund and his experience letting it go. ""As founder of an important economic development engine for our region that constantly delivers results today,"" he wrote, ""I hope that it continues to succeed well into the future.""

Édouard Glissant. La cohée du Lamentin (2005)

Just after that crucial moment. The inertia of our everyday thought was shaken off all at once. Reality and words got entangled, discordant with each other. I was attacked by contradictory feelings and emotions: a need to keep my head and try to deal with the situation; a difficulty in responding properly. The agony of thinking itself. A desire to give up everything and disappear. My words seemed unable to find an appropriate place for landing. Ignoring the media’s clamorous repetition of horrible images and mourning commentaries, I sank into a depth of total aphasia I had never before experienced.

March 11 is a very special time in Japan. Just one month to the beginning of the new academic year. During the month of March, while witnessing the ongoing disaster of suffering among homeless people and spreading radioactive clouds, I had to dig out and prepare something solid for my new students from the dusty debris of words, the vacuum of consciousness. However, what was quite impossible was to take refuge in the latest poems of a leading Korean-Japanese poet Kim Shi-Jong and translate his decentralized strange Japanese into English, yet another strange language to me. At that time, I think I wanted to withdraw from language itself as a familiar private possession.

April, however, came inescapably on time. How can I start my class? It was entitled, “The archipelago of Édouard Glissant”. I had decided in late February to honour the work of the Martinican poet/philosopher who had died just a few weeks before. I wanted to talk passionately about Glissant’s vision of “errantry” (errance) and “tremble” (tremblement) as a mode of creative wandering as well as an ancient intuition of profundity. But my feeling of mourning him was already inevitably imbued with a lament on this new disaster. How then can I start talking, I argued with myself? In what kind of language? The real earth tremor and the spiritual tremble coincided with one another, creating an interference.

Delay and detour

I have a conviction that the Humanities is a language of delay. A language that never dares to react instantaneously without the sense of deep time. The Humanities is a language of detour, too. A language that never wants to take the shortest route to reach its object. Remain here at the point of entanglement while seeking revelatory words from elsewhere. Delay and detour. In order to preserve a historical profundity: in order to play with a spatial comprehensiveness. Confronting the aftermath of the devastating tsunami, I thought I had to go very far indeed to look for words and memories strong enough to rival the actual phenomenon. And it was at that critical point that I opened my class, to be faced by a group of new students eagerly asking for words of the most urgent explanation and consolation. I did not, could not give them any words like that. Demeure, Fukushima. Take your time, remain yourself, the island of bliss. That was the first true inner voice I heard, after the long silence.

An etymological detour: Lafcadio Hearn in Japan

Today I have brought with me a book considered to be the oldest source in which the Japanese word ‘tsunami’ was first introduced to the western world and from whence it spread out into popular use worldwide. The book is: Gleanings in Buddha-Fields by Lafcadio Hearn, published in Boston by Houton Mifflin and in London by Kegan Paul in 1897. The opening chapter is called ‘A Living God’, and the word tsunami appears in this half didactic, half mystical story. Hearn wrote this short piece just after the historical earthquake of ‘Meiji-Sanriku-Jishin’ in June 1896 which caused a devastating tsunami, swallowing whole northern Tohoku-Sanriku coastal villages in an instant.

At that time, Hearn was living in Kobe. As a born journalist and storyteller, he could have depicted minutely the whole aspect of natural disaster and consequent social unrest as it unfolded. But interestingly he didn't do so. Instead, he went back some 40 years in time and precisely retold a story of another tsunami which had been turned into a popular legend. Let me quote the part where the word tsunami appears for the first time:

From time immemorial the shores of Japan have been swept, at irregular intervals over centuries, by enormous tidal waves - tidal waves caused by earthquakes or by submarine volcanic action. These awful sudden risings of the sea are called by the Japanese tsunami. The last one occurred on the evening of June 17, 1896, when a wave nearly two hundred miles long struck the northeastern provinces of Miyagi, Iwate, and Aomori, wrecking scores of towns and villages, ruining whole districts, and destroying nearly thirty thousand human lives. The story of Hamaguchi Gohei is the story of a similar calamity which happened long before the era of Meiji, on another part of the Japanese coast… (Lafcadio Hearn, ‘A Living God’, in Gleanings in Buddha-Fields. Boston & New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1897, p.16.)

A very brief, but wonderfully exact and succinct definition indeed, of the natural phenomenon called ‘Tsunami’. Hearn never takes up one single disaster as a sign of social crisis, but always sees a chain of catastrophic events, in this case tsunamis, which had occurred continuously and continually along Japanese coasts since the dawn of history. For me the detour Hearn has taken here to think about the ongoing catastrophe is very suggestive. His actual, sincere concerns lead him to take a proper distance toward the latest calamity as it plays out. In the story, he makes reference to the popular experience of yet another historical earthquake: the ‘Ansei-Nankai-Jishin’ struck the southwestern part of Japan in the late Edo era of 1854. In revisiting this legend, he makes the most effective use of so many Japanese words and phrases. “""Taihenda!"", ""Kita!"", ""Tsunami!"", ""Ojiichan!"" - people shouted and ran in all directions. But the village headman Hamaguchi Gohei wisely guided his people to the safe hill, saving all the lives in the village, and becoming as a result a living god worshipped by the villagers. Hamaguchi has remembered and respected the old sayings about tsunami handed down from generation to generation so that he could find a way to escape the disaster. This is a person as the incarnation of a chain of wisdoms. Hearn wanted to hint that he is more than an individual, a kind of crystallization of the collective common-sense that can get through such a crisis.

Behind the seemingly didactic aspect of the story, Hearn's writing also declares its mystical affiliations. He says that the ‘isolated country yashiro or miya’ which western people loosely render with words such as ‘temple’ or ‘shrine’ are actually untranslatable. Instead, to the western mind, the word ‘ghost-house’ will convey much more, because in those spirit chambers many of the lesser divinities are worshipped, ghosts of heroes, warriors, rulers and teachers who lived, loved, and died hundreds and thousands of years ago. Their spiritual afterlife is preserved in the rustic empty chamber, sometimes embodied in elemental things like a stone, flower, or the wind.

A feeling of spiritual connection with the dead and with nature’s animism prevails. They cannot be seen or heard, but this magnetic substance has an amazing and awful power in people's folk belief. Finally Hearn himself felt the sensation of being haunted by that power. In the story, he becomes a living god, bequeathing to us this mysterious description as a spiritual dweller in a small ghost-house. Hearn writes:

Elfishly small my habitation might be, but never too small, because I should have neither size nor form. I should be only a vibration - a motion as invisible as ether or magnetism; though able sometimes to shape me a shadow-body in the likeness of my former visible self, when I should wish to make an apparition. As is air to the bird, water to the fish, so would all substance be penetrable by the essence of me. (Lafcadio Hearn, ibid. p.5)

The reason that Hearn combines the folktale of tsunami and his own visionary transformation in the spirit world is clear to me. Hearn believed that the earthquake and tsunami, the very vibrations of land and ocean, reflect and resonate the tremble of the spiritual world, the vibration people feel through their everyday life amongst natural and supernatural forces. Hearn persisted in using the word tsunami in Japanese instead of using some explanatory word like ‘tidal wave’. Obviously the word tsunami itself has its own spiritual content: it is a word charged with the invisible motion of vibration, ether, and magnetism. Before being a physical and social disaster, it was proof of the tremble in which humans and all things in the universe come together in awe and in rejoicing.

Tidal after-effects: Tinian/The Marshalls

Several hours after the March 11 earthquake in Tohoku offshore, the first and fastest aftereffects of the tsunami arrived at the shore of Tinian, one of three main islands of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Micronesia. The islanders took refuge, preparing for the worst. The effect was tangible, but fortunately it was very small.

The direct relationship of the ocean and its trembling effects reminded me of the ironic history between the two Pacific islands, Japan and Tinian.

In April last year, the prime minister of Japan and some government officials put forward out of the blue an idea to relocate some of the functions of Okinawa’s Futenma US base to the island of Tokunoshima, one of the more remote islets among the Amami archipelago, just north of Okinawa. People in Tokunoshima, upset at this, called almost half of the entire populace of the islanders together in opposition to this idea of relocation, an armchair theory which had to be swiftly abandoned by the government. By contrast, during this dispute, Guam and Tinian islands’ local government continued to show their willingness to relocate and take upon themselves the central function of Futenma, without for a moment forgetting the history that the two B-29 superfortresses, Enola Gay and Bockscar, had been launched from this former Chamorro island of Tinian to bombard Hiroshima and Nagasaki some 65 years previously.

The Tinian mayor De La Cruz, of native Chamorro origin, was strongly supportive of plans to relocate Futenma troops to the island, saying that Tinian had waited for many years for such a plan to help boost the island economy. But I have heard it said that the mayor also felt responsible for the fact that the existence of an air base on his island had ultimately triggered the worst nuclear tragedy human beings had ever experienced.

Therefore, it was not strictly speaking a bid for redemption, but more than a gesture of mere goodwill, that prompted them to interfere in the power politics of big countries, to demonstrate the indigenous people's historical obligation of thinking about and sharing in the fateful burden of American bases in the context of Pacific geopolitics. Needless to say, the mayor's subtly nuanced proposition was totally ignored.

One more important hint, to aid our speculation on what is happening in Fukushima and the rest of Japan in terms of radioactive contamination, lies in another Micronesian archipelago. Just after March 11, a friend of mine―Greg Dvorak, a vigorous scholar of Pacific Studies―was sent an email from a Marshallese friend of his who was himself a victim of the postwar American nuclear test in Bikini Atoll. It was his immediate response to the Japanese friends who had started to suffer from the same fate he had long been enduring. Let me cite a fragment of his letter:

""We in the Marshall Islands are all so sorry to hear about what has been happening in Japan. Please beware of the fallout, and teach your students about what happened to us down here. We are so sorry you have to deal with this from now on, and that as with us, the radiation will not go away in your lifetimes. But please let your students know that we Marshallese have experienced far worse, and they should know that it’s going to be okay. The people of Japan are in our prayers.""

Dvorak recalls that when he read newspapers in mid-March 2011 about how many millisieverts of radiation were ‘safe’ or ‘not-safe’ within a year, he felt sick at the thought of how much of the knowledge we humans have about radiation and its effects on humans comes from scientific studies on the bodies of innocent Marshall Islanders who were subjected unknowingly to America’s cruel experiments.

According to him, for decades after the nuclear tests in the 1940s and 50s, American scientists and doctors collected medical samples from Marshallese survivors. Marshall Islander leaders claim that islanders were forced to resettle their land prematurely after the tests in order to serve as American “guinea pigs”. They criticize the doctors dispatched by the US Department of Energy who took unnecessary quantities of blood or removed healthy teeth from their bodies for experiments without sharing the results with the local population. Many individuals were taken to military hospitals in the United States and subjected to long periods of arduous, classified laboratory tests, not to alleviate their suffering but rather to produce data that could be used exclusively by the United States government regarding the effects of radiation on human beings. (For full discussion on the subject, see Greg Dvorak, “The wave which connected our islands”(“Watashi tachi no shima wo tsunaida nami”), in Ryuta Imafuku & Satoshi Ukai, eds. The First Lectures After The Tsunami (Tsunami no ato no dai-ikkou), Tokyo: Iwanami-shoten, 2012)

I have witnessed and am still witnessing the panic of the Japanese people as they worry about the everyday quantity of radiation, using expensive or unreliably cheap Geiger-Müller counters to detect the radiation level in their sphere of everyday activities, principally in order to protect their small children from direct exposure. The constantly uncertain numbers and figures soon overwhelm the most balanced mind, starting to spread outside our control. Facts and rumours circulate and thrive paradoxically on the same groundwork. But as our oceanic history testifies, these numbers have their own source in the brutal deeds of empire, a calculation at once totally authentic and scientific, but false and inhuman at the same time.

Noah’s prophecy: Günter Anders' allegory

In a stimulating collection of essays entitled Petite métaphysique des tsunami published just after the devastating Sumatra earthquake and tsunami in December 2004, a French philosopher of science, Jean-Pierre Dupuy, newly deploys the prophetic thinking of a somewhat forgotten German Jewish philosopher, Günter Anders, on our nuclear crisis. As we know, Anders who was a cousin of Walter Benjamin and the first husband of Hannah Arendt, worked in the fields of philosophy and ethics in the age of technology, focusing on the theme of the effects of mass media, the nuclear threat, and the experience of the ‘Shoah’ known to every one living on this planet. We Sons of Eichman, and Hiroshima is everywhere are some of his book titles, suggesting his allegorical, inclusive, almost archipelagic vision of all sorts of historical phenomena all over the world. In another book Burning Conscience: the case of the Hiroshima pilot, Anders exchanged letters with an ex-Tinian-based pilot Claude Eatherly who, as one of the main pilots of the seven B-29s, participated in the Hiroshima mission responsible for the loss of thousands of innocent citizens. After the war, Eatherly was the only one who admitted his crime against humanity, and turned aside to engage in pacifist activities, especially those dedicated against nuclear armaments and technology. However, as we know, the US government and the public sentiment of war heroism suppressed and silenced his sincere conversion and action, and finally Eatherly was quarantined in a mental hospital in Texas as a person driven mad by the trauma of war.

Knowing all this, Günter Anders started to exchange letters with Eatherly, trying to save this postwar Hiroshima-Tinian Noah from the violent blockade of consciousness he had endured and from the flood of discursive nightmare. With this project, Anders simultaneously published a series of open letters to the son of Adolf Eichman, persuading him to renounce a world in which humans wilfully make themselves blind for the sake of being seen to obey commands.

Rather than systematic argument, Anders preferred to convey his philosophy by telling allegorical stories and fictions. Jean-Pierre Dupuy, in order to think about the possibility of a minimal metaphysics after the tsunami, cites Anders' version of the story of Noah, thus:

Noah was tired of playing the prophet of doom and of always foretelling a catastrophe that would not occur and that no one would take seriously. One day, he clothed himself in sackcloth and put ashes on his head. This gesture was only permitted to someone lamenting the loss of his dearest child or his wife. Clothed in the habit of truth, as if plunged in mourning, he went back to the city, intent on using to his advantage the curiosity, malignity and superstition of its people. Within a short time, he had gathered around him a small crowd, and the questions began to surface. He was asked if someone was dead and who the dead person was. Noah answered that many were dead and, much to the amusement of those who were listening, that in fact they themselves were dead. Asked when this catastrophe had taken place, he answered: tomorrow. Seizing on this moment of attention and disarray, Noah stood up to his full height and began to speak: the day after tomorrow, the flood will be something that will have been. And when the flood will have been, all that is will never have existed. When the flood will have carried away all that is, all that will have been, it will be too late to remember, for there will be no one left. So there will no longer be any difference between the dead and those who weep for them. If I have come before you, it is to reverse time, it is to weep today for tomorrow's dead. The day after tomorrow, it will be too late. Upon this, he went back home, took his clothes off, removed the ashes covering his face, and went to his workshop. In the evening, a carpenter knocked on his door and said to him: let me help you build an ark, so that this may become false. Later, a roofer joined with them and said: it is raining over the mountains, let me help you, so that this may become false.” (Jean-Pierre Dupy. Petite métaphysique des tsunamis. Paris: Seuil, 2005, p.10)

What an acute allegory in our age of nuclear crisis! Mourning for the future. It's not a matter of fact, knowledge, or even ethics, but it is the system of beliefs that gives our future the necessary ontological force. It is not the choice between progress or decline, unexpected accident or technological prevention, but the ultimate acceptance of the unity of generation and degeneration. Future catastrophe might not occur, by chance, but it is still in our most profound imagination, a probability. We can only believe that it certainly will happen: but that it is just possible that it won’t happen, coincidentally - that minimal incident inherent in all accidents. Meanwhile, believe and act. There must be many Noahs in our world without firm words, with vague ashes on their heads

A delay: ten seconds or eternity in Haiti

Let us make a very short interlude of 10 seconds, which felt like cosmic eternity to a Haitian writer living in exile, Dany Laferrière. On January 12, 2010, a devastating 7.0 earthquake struck the capital city of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Laferrière, by then a Quebecois resident, was coincidentally there at the time, and happened to see the beginning of what became a record-breaking calamity. He bears witness to the longest 10 seconds in his whole life:

During these ten seconds, I was a tree, a stone, a cloud or the quake itself. What is certain was that I was not the product of a culture any more. I had a deep sensation of being a part of the cosmos. (Dany Laferrière. Tout bouge autour de moi. Paris: Grasset, 2011)

Tremble (tremblement): Edouard Glissant's utopia

Let's go back to the tremble, le tremblement, our tremor, seismic and spiritual.

In his later years, Édouard Glissant passionately discussed and tried to elaborate his important notions of ""errantry"", ""opacity"" and ""tremble"" (in Une nouvelle région du monde, 2006). Contrary to the modern straightforward logic which seeks transparency, the tremble requires errantry and opacity. This opacity is never ambiguous, it is a relationship in which one person or place calls on another person or place in its own right and freedom. Identification in relation to the other also includes identifying with the change which is therefore derived from that exchange. There, many people, many places touch each other, develop a rapport, and tremble together, just like Banyan leaves trembling in the stormy wind. Filao needles whispering by the coral shore echo a groaning voice from the sugar cane fields behind.

Glissan's island, Martinique, has experienced violent hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions for many many years.

Through the collective memory of the catastrophic forces of nature, Glissant first of all captures his strategic notion of the ‘tremble’ as a sheer natural tremor, and consequently the wisdom humans have to learn from the seismic tremble of the earth. This involves a total acceptance of the primordial energy of all things in the universe, and a sincere confrontation with the ‘Tout-Monde’ (the ‘Whole-World’) which has been and will always be trembling and shaking from the past to the future.

Moreover, at an ethical level, it means the tremble found in our inner crust. It's a process of creative vibration which occurs in the course of recognizing and understanding innumerable differences between the self and the other. To respond deeply to the other's call and urge, is to experience this intersubjective trembling. In other words, the tremble is the vibrant relationship to the other. Herein lies a clue to why we should put behind us the centralizing power of subjectivity, an inevitable source of our intentional, or involuntary violence.

In his last book entitled Earth, Fire, Water and Winds: Anthology of the Whole-World poetry (2010), Glissant included an impressive fragment of the story about the New Orleans hurricane disaster in 1856 retold by Lafcadio Hearn. While living in New Orleans in the 1870s and 80s and having travelled widely in the vast Mississippi creole/cajun delta, Hearn almost became possessed by the mysterious folklores and legends told by local fishermen. Their stories were full of drowned bodies and missing peoples violently swept off by the mighty force of the ocean. As Hearn listened to one fisherman-storyteller, and also to the clamouring of the coast in the background, there flashed back to him a recollection of some Breton legend: that the Voice of the Sea is never one voice, but a tumult of many voices - voices of drowned men, the muttering of multitudinous dead, the moaning of innumerable ghosts, all rising, to rage against the living, summoned by the great Witch call of storms…. (Lafcadio Hearn. Chita: A Memory of Last Island. Harper's Brothers, 1889)

Another trembling, outer and inner, physical and spiritual, subtly felt by both Lafcadio Hearn and Édouard Glissant. Glissant wrote in the preface of his anthology:

The ‘Tout-Monde’ is at once the mud and the ash, the libation and the elevation, the earth and the fire, the water and the secret wind. The depression and the exhaustion, the purification and the inspiration: once again the earth and the fires, the water and the wind, are brutal. In these elements dwell the human mind, people's suffering, the fight and the abandon, what you cry over and what you mediate. (Édouard Glissant. La terre le fou l'eau et les vents: Une anthologie de la poesie du Tout-Monde. Paris: GALAADE, 2010)

This is the principle of the tremble, the precondition for our shaky ‘Whole-World’. A site where the ‘Chaos-Monde’, ‘Echo-Monde’, or ‘Diversite-Monde’ vibrate and spiral. It is an assumed geography in which our errantry and tremble take place, brutally and gracefully. The vision of the tremble urges us to dive deep into our intuition. It can light up the old wisdom, all the relations that have occurred between the human being and all elemental things in the universe.

The vision of the tremble resists the bias of systematic thinking toward transparency and consistency. According to Glissant, it seeks the magnetic ties between the lands, the land and the people, and among the people - just like the relationship Lafcadio Hearn sensed in the ghostly, etheric atmosphere in his anthropomorphic imagination. The tremble happens sometimes devastatingly, but usually very subtly. It is the faintest sign hard to recognize with our ordinary senses. However, the fragility is what makes it resistant, and the fugacity guarantees its durability. Glissant, like a future Noah, tries to save our globally unitary world, by presenting his vision of ""le tremblement"" which will again fragment our world so that each part can have their own music and poetry, responding and echoing with each other, like the archipelago in our oceanic solidarity.

The agony of rhyming: a brief epilogue

When the nuclear meltdown was found in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, and the radioactive contamination was spread out in its surrounding areas, it did not take us long to start talking about the continuum which was Hiroshima and Fukushima, the oldest and most recent experience of nuclear disaster Japan has faced during these 65 years. In this juxtaposition of the two place names, there were many different contexts and connotations to be found. The similarities seemed very profound, but the facile connection of two different catastrophes also seemed dangerous. Before making these names of the so-called ‘cursed places’ into a secret code to designate the worst human tragedy, we must consider their peculiarities, the singular importance of their people, their individual dignity, specific sorrow and joy.

The rhyming of Hiroshima and Fukushima is painfully sad. It’s a dreary coincidence that both names end with the same suffix ‘-shima’. ‘Shima’ in Japanese usually means ‘island’, but its semantic origin primarily lies in the more general meaning of ‘isolated area’ or ‘enclosed area’, not exclusively that of an island surrounded by the sea.

In the Amami and Ryukyu archipelago, ‘shima’ primarily means one's native village, one's place of origin, most likely surrounded by mountains, rocks, rivers, and oceans.

Place names are essentially the reflection of people's sense of land as it is made up of elemental forces. Hokkaido's old indigenous name, Ainu-mosir, meant the quiet land of humans. The Ryukyu archipelago in their dialect is ‘Uruma’ - which means the timespace between coral reefs. Haiti, in Taino language, meant the island of many mountains. And our Fukushima, it is the island of bliss, or alternatively the island of blowing winds. These are the reflections and incarnations of the people's love and awe which they pay as a tribute to the elements which tremble and vibrate eternally.

So, Fukushima doesn't have to bear the ordeals of this coincidental rhyming with Hiroshima. It is not even coincidental. If I paraphrase Günter Anders' aphorism, ‘shima’ is everywhere: the founding sensation with which to name one's place in the vibrating echo of things. The tremble.

Noah will be our future child who has already survived the tsunami of our Genesis and Apocalypse.

82,82,FL-2012-000100-CHN,Can I keep the check and not fix my car? - NASDAQ,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-i-keep-the-check-and-not-fix-my-car-2012-06-12,"Question: I recently was directly paid for hail damage to my car. If I don't get the car repaired, can they take the money back? Is it fraud to use the money from a hail damage claim for something other than fixing the car? There is still a lien on the car.

Answer: In general, when you make a claim against your own auto insurance policy, you can choose to ""cash out"" and receive money as compensation (minus your deductible amount ) instead of having your insurer pay a body shop to fix your vehicle.

The insurance company has met its obligation by paying the repair costs for the damages that they found. They shouldn't take the money back or consider it fraud if you don't use the money to repair the vehicle. What would be fraud to your insurer is if in the future you filed another claim for the same damage.

However, if you don't own your car outright but instead have a loan or lease on it, then you aren't totally in control of how your claim payout can be used. If you tried to keep the money from yourcomprehensive claim for hail damages, your lien holder is going to take issue with you that their asset is not being repaired. (See "" Hail claims: What you need to know "")

Most lenders require you to place them on your auto insurance policy as an loss payee so that the insurer will issue any check for repairs (or the totaling of the car) to both you and your lien holder.

To cash a claim check made out to both of you, normally you'd endorse the check and send it onto the lien holder, who will may require you send documentation that the repairs were made to the vehicle (such as a copy of the repair bill and photographs of the repaired car) before they will sign over the check to you or a repair shop.

If you cashed a check made out to you and the lien holder without their endorsement (or by forging their signature), then this could be considered fraud and get you into a lot trouble.

If the check were made out only to you, your finance agreement would still normally require you to notify your lien holder about the damages and insurance payout. Most lenders would mandate you to use the money for the needed repairs; however, you can discuss the issue with your particular lien holder.

If the hail damage isn't that extensive and your loan is almost paid off, or if you plan on using the claim money to pay off the loan, then your lien holder may not require you to get the repairs made. Don't be surprised, though, if they demand that you fix the car.

If your lien holder does allow you keep the money and skip the repairs, remember that this now pre-existing damage the insurer will take into account if your car sustains damage in the future. Your insurer will deduct for this previous damage if the car is damaged in the same area or if the car is totaled out.

But when Bangladeshi villagers took a closer look, they found a baby too weak to cry, a refugee from marauding mobs in Myanmar apparently abandoned by her family.

GOLAR PARA, Bangladesh (Reuters) - At first, the boat bobbing in the water in the middle of the night appeared to be empty. But when Bangladeshi villagers took a closer look, they found a baby too weak to cry, a refugee from marauding mobs in Myanmar apparently abandoned by her family.

The cleft-lipped infant, just weeks old, is among hundreds of Rohingya Muslims who fled this month's sectarian violence in Myanmar's western state of Rakhine, packing themselves into rough wooden boats and heading for the shores of neighbouring Bangladesh.

No one knows how many made it ashore. Bangladesh has ordered its border guards to push the boats back, determined that - with at least quarter of a million ""illegal migrants"" already here - there must be no more.

The baby, named Fatima by the family that has taken her in, is out of the danger that she and her family faced in Myanmar, but she joins a throng of stateless people in southeast Bangladesh who - for the most part - lead desperate lives of squalor, deprivation and discrimination.

Among them is Mohammad Kamal, a young religious leader from Rakhine's Maungdaw district, where ferocious violence erupted on June 9 between Rohingyas and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and spread across the state. He escaped to Bangladesh in 2006 after his brother and others were jailed in a crackdown on Muslim clerics.

Kamal, now 28, settled in a makeshift ""unregistered"" camp, where - along with some 20,000 others - he is not recognised as a refugee and where even international aid agencies have to work under the radar because Bangladesh has not granted them legal status.

""I went out for a walk one day last year and was arrested because I had no documents,"" said Kamal, pulling up a trouser leg to show a line of angry sores that broke out during the following nine months he spent in jail.

Behind him, naked children play in a muddy pool and the rickety dwellings of an overcrowded shanty town - his camp - rise up, lashed by monsoon rains.

In 2010, the authorities forcibly evicted thousands from a makeshift camp. The medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres recounted at the time that some Rohingyas had been thrown into the Naf River and told to swim the 3 km (2 miles) back to Myanmar, and the organisation said it had treated many for beatings, machete wounds and even rape.

""A DESPERATE LIFE""

Craig Sanders, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' representative in Dhaka, said that although Bangladesh has disowned the Rohingyas - dubbing them illegal economic migrants - it has shown ""tremendous generosity over many years"".

Rohingyas first came in large numbers to the South Asian nation in 1973, and over the years gained a reputation for drug-smuggling, gun-running and human trafficking.

A sudden flood of more than quarter of a million arrived in 1991-92 after a spasm of repression by the security forces in military-ruled Myanmar. Those that remain from that wave, now numbering some 30,000, live in two official camps where the U.N. provides everything from shelter and water supply to healthcare and schooling.

But at least 200,000 others - probably many more - have settled on the Bangladesh side of the 200-km (125-mile) border, mingling with the population where they struggle to find employment or squeezing into unofficial camps.

It is these ""unregistered"" Rohingyas who are most vulnerable.

""It's an extremely desperate life for these people,"" said one worker for a humanitarian group that provides assistance illegally at one camp, asking not to be named. ""They have been here for such a long time and there is no prospect of change.""

UNHCR's Sanders has crossed swords with the government in recent days over its decision to turn back the boatloads of traumatised Rohingyas.

""Bangladesh, one more time, is being urged to step forward to deal with a situation that is not of their making,"" he said. ""We are not trying to push them into a corner on this issue, but there is a question of fair and right treatment here.""

BANGLADESH SAYS ""NO MORE""

There have been sketchy and conflicting reports of the communal violence that erupted in Rakhine, but scores are feared dead after widespread torching of houses by both sides.

Abdus Salam, one of 10 Rohingyas who reached Bangladesh and are now hiding in a coastal village to avoid arrest, told Reuters last week: ""The Rakhine torched our houses, killed our relatives, assaulted our women. They were killing Muslims. When we protested, the government forces also shot our people dead. Then we started fleeing.""

Muhammad Zamir, Dhaka's chief information commissioner, maintains that the authorities have treated the boat people humanely, providing those they turn away with water, medicines and fuel for the journey back, assisting a woman who gave birth on arrival and treating those with gunshot wounds in hospital.

""We want to help the refugees, they have rights,"" Zamir told Reuters in the coastal town of Cox's Bazar, a bumpy three-hour drive from the shores where Rohingyas are being pushed back.

""But we can only look after them to a point. We really can't handle any more.""

He argues that, as a densely populated and poverty-plagued country of 150 million, Bangladesh has played its part. Now, as democracy stirs in Myanmar, it is time for its neighbour to address the root causes of the chronic exodus of Rohingyas, and for the international community to put pressure on it to do so.

SILENT CRISIS

There has been some dismay in this part of Bangladesh at the hard line taken by the government on the new arrivals. The populations share the same ethnicity, religion and dialect, and they are so close that if you call a Rohingya on a mobile phone in Myanmar it is likely to be a Bangladesh number.

Yet the plight of those already here gets little attention.

A report by U.S.-based rights group Refugees International last year described a ""silent crisis"" of abuse, starvation and detention faced by stateless Rohingyas in Bangladesh.

According to UNHCR, a 2011 survey in the two official camps found that 17 percent of children between six months and six years were suffering from acute malnutrition, higher than the emergency threshold set by the World Health Organisation. In the makeshift camps, malnutrition rates are even higher.

""It's a hopeless situation,"" said the aid worker. ""You treat the children who are sick, and then they fall ill again because they are not getting the right food.""

For now at least, tiny Fatima is safe. She has been taken in by a fisherman and his wife who already have four sons and two daughters. But an uncertain future awaits her, stateless in the land of her refuge.

85,85,FL-2012-000100-CHN,The 5 in 5 - QSR magazine,https://www.qsrmagazine.com/growth/5-5,"In the highly competitive restaurant industry, where innovation reigns, a lot can happen in the span of half a decade. Five years ago, the quick-serve industry was a different place. Five Guys was mostly a regional player and the better-burger category had yet to explode. Chipotle started making headlines with its commitment to sustainable food. And operators were raving about hot trends like eco-friendly packaging and the renewed focus on coffee.

Now, of course, all of that is old news. Five Guys leapt into national prominence and ushered in the “better burger” category. Chipotle became a major leader in the locally grown food movement, inspiring others to take a closer look at their menus. Once-trendy ideas like greener packaging and gourmet coffee are now a given at many companies. In a similar vein, restaurants in their infancy today could be the heavyweights of tomorrow, spurred to growth by a new generation of customers.

Weaned on social media, scarred by the recession, and increasingly interested in global flavors, today’s consumers are seeking out a different kind of restaurant.

In the next half-decade, these five segments stand to gain the most.

The Eco-Burger

Anthropologists believe all of Western civilization was built on wheat and beef, and, according to a recent article in The New York Times, Americans eat more meat than anyone else on the planet.

But Liz Aviles, vice president of market intelligence for Chicago-based marketing agency Upshot, says that’s starting to change. Within five years, she says, the “Meatless Mondays” movement and a commitment to less meat consumption will permanently change the face of the quick-service burger industry.

“Meat sales are down,” Aviles says. “There’s been a lot of talk in the meat industry itself as to why that is happening. I think in many ways the peak consumption of meat is behind us.”

Of course, no one believes burgers will go away. Instead, Aviles says, they’re going to evolve. While the “better burger” concept is already well established, tomorrow’s burger will be a “cleaner burger.” Chains like Chicago-based Epic Burger will claim the moral high ground in the next five years with fewer preservatives and a strong sustainability message.

“To me, Epic is really well grounded in a growing percentage of the population’s attitude about meat and meat consumption,” Aviles says. “[It’s] this idea that when we do eat meat, we want to eat meat that we trust and that we consider safe, especially when it comes to ground beef. We want to feel good about it.”



Shake Shack

Epic Burger’s website stakes out a strong claim to purity. “Our menu is all about what is NOT on it,” the site says. It explains what’s missing: “hormones, antibiotics, trans fats, food coloring, preservatives, nitrates, and yellow mustard.”

Epic Burger mirrors concepts like Shake Shack and Burgerville, both chains that make eco-friendly products an important part of the brand identity. John Gordon, president and CEO of the Pacific Management Consulting Group, says whatever form it takes, the upscale burger will continue to be dominant in 2017.

“We talk and think a lot about this so-called ‘better burger spinoff,’ and when does this reach maturity,” Gordon says. “I don’t think any of them are at a maturity point yet. They still have a considerable period of time to run.”

Asian Meets Fast Casual

India and China are the world’s most populous countries, but so far Asian food has made only limited inroads in the American quick-serve industry. But that’s all set to change. Eric Giandelone, director of foodservice research for Mintel Menu Insights, says the market is wide open for an Asian concept with a mid-market price point and a semi-upscale feel. He compares the situation to that of a few years ago when Chipotle was starting to become prominent.

“There was very high end for casual-dining Mexican and then there was lower,” Giandelone says. “Chipotle kind of changed that by offering that in-between. The same is kind of true with Asian food right now.”

Once again, it may be Chipotle’s founder who gets there first. ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen, founded in 2011 by Chipotle co-CEO Steve Ells, features a short menu of fast-casual Asian dishes like bowls of meat with toppings or sandwiches with green papaya slaw. It launched to tremendous acclaim, and Chipotle’s stock price shot up as a result.

But other chains are also getting in on the act. Chutney Joe’s, a fast-casual Indian concept with two units in Chicago, plans to expand to other markets through franchising within the next few years; same goes for Merzi in Washington, D.C. Noodles & Company, a Colorado-based fast casual, plans to further develop the Asian section of its multifaceted menu. While the American and Mediterranean noodle dishes have been the most popular offerings, director of communications Jill Preston says customers are definitely leaning East.

Juice: The Next Step in Fresh



Evolution Fresh

When Starbucks coughs, trend watchers buy cough syrup. From its approach to customer service to its breakfast offerings, the company has often been a step or three ahead of its competitors. Aviles says Starbucks’ latest offering, the Evolution Fresh juice bar, is a taste of what we’ll be seeing in 2017.

“Starbucks’ Evolution Fresh is a harbinger of more concepts to come,” Aviles says. “It’s a ‘juice and food experience.’ I think that’s the key.”

Starbucks acquired the brand late in 2011 and opened its first store this March. It’s an urban, upscale concept with natural wood fixtures and several LEED-certified features. The price point is high—$7.99 for a 16-ounce juice—and the company is branding the experience as “super-premium.” Aviles says customers are willing to spend more for the feeling that they’re doing something good for themselves.

“As much as we like the miracle ingredient, we don’t want our food scientific,” Aviles says. “We want it to feel natural.”

Jamba Juice is currently the strongest player in the juice space, but there are other up-and-coming brands as well. Roxberry Juice, which has eight stores in two states, was recently added to Beautiful Brands International’s portfolio, and the recently founded Daily Kitchen & Wellness Bar also offers fresh juice blends.

One key element of the new juice craze will be to-go offerings. Ready-to-go drinks and foods like those offered by Evolution Fresh will continue to gain in popularity, even in locations not traditionally associated with healthy eating.

“Because the population is generally time starved, some gasoline and convenience-store operations are doing such a spectacular job of food in retail,” Gordon says. “I think there will be a development in smaller, faster portions.”

Next: Build-Your-Own Everything

[pagebreak]

Build-Your-Own Everything

From drive-thru speakers to high-efficiency fryers to touch-screen POS systems, quick-serve restaurants have long been the earliest adopters of new restaurant technology. But the restaurants of 2017 will put even today’s tech-savvy restaurateurs to shame. Robotics, touch-screen ordering, and customized-to-the-max orders will become increasingly established parts of the quick-serve experience.

Jeremy Umland, founder and CEO of sushi company Ozumo Concepts International, will be one of those leading the charge. His recently launched u-sushi concept combines customization and a high level of technology, and provides a small sample of what restaurants may look like in five years.

“We’re new on the block,” Umland says. “So whatever we present, if it strikes a chord with the customers, it’s going to be a bigger win for us.”

Part of the technology is behind the counter. Automated rice cleaners, mixers, cookers, and sheeters make sure the whole process is quick and consistent. It’s a departure from the chef-focused ethos of a traditional sushi restaurant, but Umland says customers don’t seem to mind at all.

“People get a real kick out of seeing the machine deliver this perfectly fresh sheet of rice,” Umland says. “It’s clean, it’s fresh, and it’s fast. [The machines] look modern and cool.”

U-sushi allows customers plenty of room to customize, from subbing out an ingredient or two to creating whole rolls from scratch. A touch-screen ordering system makes the process easier.

Another restaurant taking this DIY approach is Burger Studio, where kiosks allow customers to play around with 30 possible toppings to customize their dream burger. Giandelone says this approach to ordering will become more popular by 2017.

“Customers increasingly are going to be placing their own orders,” Giandelone says. “That churn is going to get ever quicker because of that.”

Of course, anyone familiar with the airline industry knows that high-tech touch screens don’t necessarily mean the customer is about to have a good time. While Giandelone mentions several pros to the new technology (faster service, easier payment processing, no miscommunication about orders), there’s also one major con.

“That hasn’t exactly been a very positive experience for a lot of people,” Giandelone says. “If this technology works, the benefits are really high. But on the day that it breaks down or stops working, it’s an easily frustrating experience.”

International Invasion

As the economy rebounds, the American market will be increasingly saturated with foreign-based brands, experts say.

Alison Vickers, business development director for United Kingdom–based YO! Sushi, says the U.S. is ripe for new concepts.



Yo! Sushi

“I think from a growth standpoint, the U.S. is certainly ahead of Europe in terms of coming out of the sluggishness of the economic downturn,” Vickers says. “Obviously we’re just starting our journey in the U.S., but we’ve done a lot of research.”

The conveyor-belt sushi chain (where customers pick and choose from color-coded dishes as they slowly roll by) just opened its first location in the U.S. and aims to have between 50 and 70 locations by 2017.

But while economic strength is one factor, there are other reasons for international chains to set up shop under the stars and stripes. Gordon and Aviles both point to the changing tastes of a younger generation. As kids raised on Italian and Mexican food seek to broaden their culinary horizons, a growing population of immigrants is looking for a taste of home.

“In the United States, the population has become much more diverse,” Gordon says. “We are not a typical extended suburban nation anymore.”

Philippines-based Jollibee offers hamburgers, spaghetti, and chicken alongside more exotic fare like breakfast pork-and-rice platters or Fiesta Noodles with shrimp and hardboiled egg. It has 26 stores in the U.S., and recently opened one in Anaheim, California. South African chicken restaurant Nando’s has several U.S. locations, as does Guatemala’s Pollo Campero.

Giandelone says that during the next five years, old chains will expand and new ones will enter the market. The biggest pressure will be on existing concepts, which risk losing market share if they can’t convince customers they’re just as good as the “real thing.”

“When a restaurant opens up and they’re from China, who has more credibility presenting Chinese food in that instance?” Giandelone asks. “That’s going to be the challenge U.S. operators are going to face.”

However, globalization is a double-edged sword. Vickers points out that just as international brands will be entering the U.S., American chains will have new opportunities to expand abroad.

“More brands will cross over,” Vickers says. “Good brands will work in most metro cities around the world and not just in the country they were invented in.”

The world of 2017 will be a different place. Better burgers will be more eco-friendly, and they’ll be ordered via touch screen. Upscale Asian restaurants—possibly even some from Asia—will grab more market share. And as time pressure builds, fresher-than-fresh juice will become a grab-and-go commodity. If all the progress seems like a blur, there’s a reason for that. Trends aren’t just taking hold—they’re taking hold faster than ever.

“It used to take so long for that to trickle from your urban centers,” Aviles says. “Companies are reacting so much faster.”","Tue, 19 Jun 2012 23:48:24 GMT",https://www.qsrmagazine.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/growth/5-hottest-quick-serve-segments-5-years.jpg?itok=XhbraLox,"['restaurant', 'giandelone', 'juice', 'asian', 'aviles', 'burger', 'meat', 'think', 'customers', 'food']",

[dropcap]W[/dropcap]e have the best Korean technology and also the mentality of the Korean approach. We can do. We will do!” said Mr Lee Young Hoon, President & CEO of HVS. “We will become the best shipyard for bulk carriers in the world and we are preparing ourselves to achieve this ambition.”

He pointed out that HVS has achieved its success through its relationship with its parent company, Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co Ltd, which is a 70% shareholder and controls all the commercial factors, design work, procurement, production and service guarantees for all the vessels built in the yard.

Sixteen of the ships built to date and another 11 ships in the order book are classed by DNV. As part of the journey to becoming a dedicated shipbuilder, Hyundai-Vinashin selected DNV for its ISO quality certification.

Mr Lee called DNV “a partner in our strategy to deliver the highest quality bulk carriers to the international market.”

He also pointed out that “We have 110 Korean shipbuilding specialists and 3,700 Vietnamese workers. We have completely transferred all of the best practices, quality control and discipline from our parent company Hyundai Mipo to our site in Vietnam.” He added that reputable ship owners, such as E.R. Schiffahrt, Norden, Geden, ESL Shipping and others, that have built here “enjoy productivity and quality that is the same standard as that at our parent yard in South Korea.”

In the first quarter of 2012, Hyundai-Vinashin reached a new milestone in its newbuilding history with the delivery of the 82,000 dwt bulk carrier named M/V Ams Pegasus I to HI-Invest. The vessel was the largest delivered by the Korean-managed shipyard since HVS first started building ships in 2008.

DNV is the primary classification partner for the shipyard. Hyundai-Vinashin’s first two vessels, delivered in July 2009 and October 2009, were built to DNV class.

These two 56,000 dwt bulk carriers for German owner E.R. Schiffahrt were selected as Significant Ships of 2009 by the Royal Institution of Naval Architects.

President Lee is very proud of what has been achieved by the yard in such a short period and very confident about the yard’s great prospects, pointing out, “we are facing a very weak demand for ships at the moment, but I really don’t have worries. We are fully backed by the financial strength of the Hyundai Group. This is when we are able to spend even more time strengthening the already high capability of our workforce. We invite international owners to visit the shipyard and see for themselves the high standards that are in place here.”

Market misconceptions

Only a one-hour drive from the bustling coastal city of Nha Trang in southeastern Vietnam, the shipyard is ideally positioned, with a 10-month dry season with low humidity and two-month rainy season from October to December. The site is protected from the open sea by a large island several kilometres offshore. The sunny tranquillity and beauty of the natural landscape of the nearby coastline is in sharp contrast to the somewhat long shadow cast by the market perception that any shipbuilding site in Vietnam is far behind one in China.

To clarify the first misconception, Mr Lee said HVS is recruiting from 10 universities in Vietnam and has 3,700 employees working in the yard. “Our experience of working in Vietnam is that the workers are in fact very optimistic, open-minded about international practices, passionate about craftsmanship and above-all very hardworking.”

The other challenge faced by HVS is that caused by the financial troubles at Vinashin Group.

“It’s true that the Vietnamese enterprise Vinashin Group has encountered some severe difficulties, but here I must emphasise that Vinashin’s involvement with the shipyard is as a contributor of the land. They have not invested financially in our shipyard and nor are they directly involved in any management of the shipyard,” said President Lee.

[pullquote]A high-quality bulk carrier builder, is like a vigorous Korean tree that has taken strong root in Vietnamese soil.[/pullquote]Hyundai Group signed the joint-venture contract with Vietnam Shipbuilding Industry Group (Vinashin), according to which Hyundai has a shareholding of 70% while Vinashin has a shareholding of 30%, in 1996 and Vinashin’s 30% stake is for land rental only. All investment in the shipyard has been done by Hyundai Heavy Industries Group and the shipyard has Korean management and key personnel (general managers), which means HVS is entirely independent from the Vinashin Group.

HVS operates as a subsidiary and subcontractor of Hyundai Mipo Dockyard (HMD), which takes full responsibility for business development, engineering and procurement. Virtually all the steel plate and equipment are shipped from South Korea, except for some foreign-licence-built equipment such as MacGregor cranes and hatch covers.

“Any clients who have come to our shipyard can immediately see that this shipyard achieves very high quality, like our parent company, but is just located in Vietnam,” said Mr Lee.

HVS does not have its own marketing division as it serves as a subcontractor of the Korea-based HMD according to a very specific agreement between the parent and subsidiary. The shipyard operates inside a Korean IT system which controls production and human resources.

HVS has adopted the same quality assurance and Health Safety & Environment systems as HMD. Ships are built by HVS according to a design and production package supplied by HMD.

HMD has delivered over 600 newbuildings and HVS is following the same path. Foreign owners such as Norden, for example, expect and experience the same attention to safety and quality as is the case at HMD.

“As a Danish company, our standards and the flag standards are extremely high. We have very strict standards with regard to safety and the environment. Actually, we are fully satisfied by HVS’s standard both in quality and safety,” said Kim Hai Nguyen, a Naval Architect & Site Manager with Norden, which has ordered six ships and taken delivery of four from HVS.

“We do bear in mind that Vietnam is a developing country where the challenges are substantial. At the same time, we don’t compromise on our quality requirements for the shipbuilding process and our care for workers,” said Mr Nguyen. “HVS positions itself as HMD located in Vietnam, and we have found this to be very true.”

Competitive edge to sharpen Since it started operation in 1999, HVS has acquired extensive know-how and expertise in shipbuilding techniques through repair and conversion work on various ship types, including sophisticated offshore projects.

HVS cut its teeth in the repair sector. Until it stopped ship repair work in 2011, it had repaired over 900 ships, including some very complex conversions and repairs such as lengthening Pure Car Truck Carriers by 28.8 metres, crane vessels, Floating Storage Offloading units and even platforms.

Since venturing into the newbuilding market in 2008, the company has focused on bulk carrier newbuildings from Handysize up to Kamsarmax-size and has successfully delivered 22 high quality ships to worldwide customers.

All shipbuilders are facing hard times based on continued concerns over the European debt crisis and the imbalance between supply and demand, and HVS is no exception.

Furthermore, due to the lack of finance, the poor charter market and the increasing number of idle vessels, contracting activity has slowed down considerably and the market prices remain under downward pressure while all related building costs (material, labour and other services) are increasing continuously.

HVS also senses severe competition from Chinese yards, which have access to cheap human resources and government support.

However, in this global downturn, HVS believes that strengthening its quality and competitiveness is the only way to survive and thrive.

“I don’t worry about the market situation since I see the current market conditions as an opportunity to train our workforce,” said President Lee. “We will develop qualified workers to prepare for the market upturn.”

There are 3,700 permanent staff and 1,000 subcontractors working at the shipyard. In addition to the focus on enhancing employees’ basic technical skills, HVS is also investing in developing management skills at the yard.

The yard has 110 Korean experts who are managers and general managers. Vietnamese staff are currently acting as middle management. A number of Vietnamese workers go each year to HMD for training for further promotion to upper management positions.

HVS’s Education & Training Department is mainly responsible for the training and development of Vietnamese workers. HVS organises many training courses guided by Korean instructors or well-known local professors. In addition, HVS regularly dispatches Vietnamese staff to HMD for training in up-to-date technology and “studying the working spirit in shipbuilding.”

According to Mr Park Tae Wook, Vice President of HVS, the shipyard has two shifts – 7:30 am to 5:00 pm for all types of work and then a night shift from 7:30 pm to 6:00 am, which is only allocated to steel cutting, block blasting and painting. The yard can handle 450 tonnes of steel a day and can now build 20 ships a year.

The yard’s productivity has improved gradually since 2008 and there is even further improvement ahead.

The pace of construction is 10 months from steel cutting to delivery, with 4.5 months for block fabrication, three months in the dock and 2.5 months at the quayside. This compares to eight months at HMD.

“The labour productivity is now 2.0 compared to 1 for Korea, and the target for the coming years is to bring this to 1.5 by 2014,” said Park Tae Wook, the Vice President for the Customer Support Division.

HVS also benefits from the leading edge design work of the HMD design office, which has 700 employees working on new designs on a regular basis. They use the state-of-the-art engineering system to constantly search to improve the portfolio of designs using the latest generation of engines, optimised hull forms and energy saving technologies.

In order to meet customers’ various needs for fuel efficiency and environmental features, HMD is currently focusing on developing the latest “ECO” designs to satisfy the increasing global demand for higher efficiency vessels.

Three areas of focus

Quality improvement, cost reductions and safety guarantees are currently HVS’s three focus areas.

HVS’s management highlights that the quality of the ships has been showing up quite well even compared to HMD, based on a strict consideration of non-conformity reports and guarantee claims.

Being selective with owners and other partners has been one of the keys to HMD’s and HVS’s success.

Over the past 15 years, HVS has achieved close and good cooperation with all the international classification societies, such as DNV, KR, ABS, NK, relating to both ship repairs and newbuildings.

“We are very happy with DNV as it operates at the highest level of professionalism and is one of the world’s top classification societies. Even minor comments and/or recommendations are carefully reviewed so as to ensure customer satisfaction,” said Mr Lee Jong Chan, General Manager of the Contract Management Department.

“From when HVS commenced the first newbuilding project with DNV until now, we sincerely appreciate DNV support and cooperation in all respects, especially its willingness to clarify issues at the initial stage,” said Mr Lee Jong Chan.

HMD is known as the world’s leading shipbuilder for medium-sized Product Carriers, Containers, Pure Car and Truck Carriers, Ro-Ro/Con-Ro Vessels and LPG Carriers. Due to HVS’s abilities, HMD has recommended some customers to order certain types of bulk carriers from HVS to get the same quality and safety standards as from HMD but at a better price.

HVS’s status is as HMD’s subcontractor for construction while HMD will remain as the main contractor and will undertake all the Contract’s guarantees and responsibilities.

At this moment, HVS only focuses on the construction of bulk carriers but other ship types may be considered in the future, depending on the market situation.

“As always, HMD has a glorious track record of various ship types and will be able to support us in building other ship types based on their know-how and the experience we have been accumulating,” said President Lee.

90,90,FL-2012-000100-CHN,IPv6: When do you really need to switch? - ZDNet,https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipv6-when-do-you-really-need-to-switch/,"World IPv6 Day, 6 June, 2012 is here, and with it many ISPs, websites and manufacturers are now supporting IPv6, the next generation network protocol of the internet.

For many users, though, the questions of what, when and why still await answers.

Everyone in networking knows that they should be switching to IPv6. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) realised that in 1994, when it predicted that IPv4's 4.3 billion addresses wouldn't be enough. Its answer was IPv6. With its 128-bit address space it can have up to 2^128 addresses — that's 40,282,366,920 billion billion billion usable addresses. Even an interstellar internet won't run out of numbers any time soon.

Meanwhile, back on Earth, the regional internet registries (RIRs) in charge of parceling out IP addresses are down to their last old-style IPv4 addresses. Indeed, the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC) ran out of IPv4 addresses in April 2011. RIPE NCC, Europe's RIR, will be the next to run out sometime in August. In North America, the last IPv4 address will be assigned in June 2013.

That will be the end of the road for new IPv4 addresses. Technologies like Network Address Translation (NAT) and Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) that let us run multiple devices behind a single IP address have won us some time, but while neither NAT nor CIDR will be going away soon, they can't delay the IPv4 famine any longer.

Not so straightforward

Yet a straightforward switchover can't happen because IPv4 and IPv6 aren't compatible protocols. Dual network stacks that support both protocols will be necessary for the foreseeable future.

Vint Cerf has described the delay in IPv6 implementation as ""understandable but inexcusable"". Photo credit: David Meyer

Vint Cerf, one of the fathers of the internet and the man who takes responsibility for IPv4's ""inadequate"" number of addresses, told CNET News's Stephen Shankland in an interview that he'd ""hoped for much earlier implementation [of IPv6]. ""It would have been so much easier. But people had not run out of IPv4 and NAT boxes were around (ugh), so the delay is understandable but inexcusable. It is still going to take time to get everyone on board,"" Cerf said.

Another reason why IPv6 adoption has been so slow is the classic chicken-and-egg problem of which comes first, the technology or the users.

As Bob Hinden, co-inventer of IPv6 and a fellow with Check Point, the network security company, explains: ""The problem that IPv6 solves is it provides a larger IP address space than IPv4. However, no one gets the full benefit of IPv6 deployment until everyone supports it. There was little incentive for organisations to adopt IPv6 as long as they could still get IPv4 addresses.

""In essence, organisations delayed investing in IPv6 until they absolutely had to. However, the pool of unallocated IPv4 addresses is close to being exhausted with the last block of free IPv4 addresses assigned on January 2011. IPv4 addresses are now much harder to get for most enterprises, and large blocks needed by ISPs are close to impossible to obtain. So now, organisations are waking up to the need to deploy IPv6, and we're seeing wider acceptance.""

Who's on board IPv6 today?

How much wider acceptance of IPv6 is there really? Craig Sprosts, general manager of Fixed Broadband Solutions at Nominum, a network services company in Redwood City, California, has these findings from a survey of 67 ISPs, providing internet service to over 110 million US households. Nominum's survey ""found that 97 percent of these companies have implemented or plan to implement IPv6; 23 percent have already done so, 35 percent plan to do so this year and 39 percent plan to do so in 2013 or later"".

That sounds good, and there has been growth in IPv6 traffic. Hurricane Electric, an IPv6 ISP and backbone provider with a claimed 58.6 percent of the world's IPv6 networks, states that IPv6 internet traffic has grown over 150 percent since 2011's Global IPv6 Day.

No one gets the full benefit of IPv6 deployment until everyone supports it. There was little incentive for organisations to adopt IPv6 as long as they could still get IPv4 addresses. – Bob Hinden

On the other hand, Burt Kaliski, CTO of VeriSign (operator of the root DNS [Domain Name Service] servers and the .com and .net registries) says that while IPv6 DNS traffic has tripled over the last year, ""we're not seeing a significant increase in the percentage of transactions carried over IPv6 for .com and .net and it has been relatively flat over the last year"".

No matter how you measure it, IPv6 traffic is still a tiny fraction of the global internet traffic.

Indeed, Leslie Daigle, chief internet technology officer of the Internet Society, confirms that the goal for World IPv6 Day was to provide only one percent of users with IPv6 access. This ""is enough traffic to demonstrate that access providers are well advanced in their actual deployment plans. With that, and the fact that content providers are turning on IPv6 and leaving it on for this year's challenge, we have the basis for our statement that: this time it's for real; after June 6 2012, IPv6 is the new normal for Internetworking"".

Why only one percent? It's because the Internet Society knows most people aren't ready yet. Daigle explains: ""The goal is to reach one percent by June. In many cases, users may need to upgrade or replace hardware and software, such as operating systems or home routers, to use IPv6. Over time, as users upgrade, IPv6 adoption will increase without any changes in the ISP's service or equipment.""

So why should you upgrade?

With less than one percent of internet connectivity, you may not find the case for upgrading to IPV6 compelling.

Yet, while the traffic may not be there yet, major websites are moving to dual-stack network solutions. Erik Nygren, chief architect for Akamai, a content delivery network (CDN) company, says: ""Akamai has IPv6-enabled over 50 major websites belonging to over 20 of the world's largest web companies that participated in last year's World IPv6 Day event. The company anticipates traffic levels will continue to increase as more customer sites dual-stack in the period following this year's World IPv6 Launch where over one-third of the top 30 registered sites by Alexa rank will be using some of Akamai's IPv6 services.""

Nygren continues: ""As of May 18 of this year, over 700 US government sites across 21 agencies were permanently dual-stacked using Akamai's services as the company continues to help their customers meet the US federal government mandate (PDF) requiring all public-facing government sites to be enabled for IPv6 by the end of September 2012.""

With Facebook, Google and Yahoo also moving to IPv6 there will be...

...sites that IPv6-enabled users can reach. Of course, they'll still be able to reach them by IPv4 as well. As Sampa Choudhuri, a Cisco small business marketing manager, recently blogged, ""Your current network running IPv4-based devices won't be obsolete for some time.""

However, as John Curran, president and CEO of the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN), North America's RIR, explains: ""World IPv6 Launch Day is a lot larger than people understand. IPv6 is the single largest upgrade in the history of the internet. It's not a small decision for the major content providers to turn on IPv6 and leave it on. Going forward, internet users will be forced to go through transition gateways to reach businesses that do not similarly upgrade by adding IPv6 connectivity, with the result being slower connections and services for their customers.""

Those transaction gateways, which slow down traffic, already exist. Alain Fiocco, Cisco's Senior Pv6 Program Director, says, ""For a real-world example of IPv6's impact on business-to-consumer services, look to online banking. While a common web service, online banking is actually a complex application that, delivered through IPv4, is bogged down jumping translation hurdles to reach an IPv6 household. Therefore, an IPv4 bank risks losing customers [that] consider a speedy, complex and rich online experience an integral part of the business relationship.""

For businesses working with other businesses, Fiocco thinks the need is even greater. ""Other industries — particularly in B2B — don't have a choice. Manufacturing companies with partners in IPv4-exhausted regions (eg, China, Vietnam) have already made the switch,"" he says.

Tom Coffeen, IPv6 evangelist for InfoBlox, a US network services company, agrees. ""Given the exhaustion of IPv4 in Asia (with Europe to follow in a few weeks) many newly connected (and all future) internet users will be requesting content from IPv6-enabled devices,"" he says. ""Companies are becoming more aware of the risk to competitive advantage brought on by failing to make their public-facing (ie, internet available) content over IPv6. As a result, the logical scope of IPv6 adoption for most companies will be to get their content online via IPv6.

Increased customer loyalty, higher network efficiency and reduced costs can all be powerful byproducts of the IPv6 transition. – Craig Sprosts, Nominum

""Specifically, for many organisations this will mean configuring one or more web servers with IPv6,"" Coffeen continues. ""In most cases this will be done on the same servers that currently support IPv4, leading to a 'dual-stack' configuration. Of course, the supporting network segment, router and/or firewall will need to support IPv6 as well. Companies that rely on web hosting or a CDN will need to make sure those service providers support IPv6.""

Besides, as Nominum's Sprosts notes, since ""the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is a necessity to keep the internet running and growing"" you might as well make the best of it. ""Operators, content providers and enterprises should not ignore the powerful business benefits associated with the 'new' internet. Things like increased customer loyalty, higher network efficiency and reduced costs can all be powerful byproducts of the IPv6 transition,"" Sprosts says.

In short, there are business reasons for starting your IPv6 move.

When should you upgrade?

""When? That's the 2^128-address question,"" says Cisco's Fiocco. ""As more and more consumers switch to IPv6 — AT&T, Comcast, Time Warner and other service providers now bring new households online via IPv6 as a matter of course — it would make sense for businesses to provide services and content via IPv6 sooner rather than later.""

Owen DeLong, Hurricane Electric's IPv6 evangelist, agrees. ""The sooner you start, the better you can plan/prepare. Plan on adding IPv6 to your existing capabilities and maintaining dual-stack for several years."" He also warns, ""Expect to have to touch everything in your network."" That isn't easy.

Security in particular needs careful consideration, with IPv6 adding a whole new interface to the internet to manage and monitor.

As Chris Smithee, Strategic Solutions Architect with Lancope, a network performance and security company, explains: ""For those looking to transition from IPv4 to IPv6, it is important to know that it does not happen with a flip of a switch. There are certain steps that need to be taken to guarantee success during the switch.""

Smithee continues: ""To start the transition, many may decide to run dual-stack networks, which allow for the operation of both IPv4 and IPv6 environments across the same hardware, ensuring no disruption to service delivery. During this process, it is paramount that organisations implement network monitoring technologies.

""Technologies like flow-based monitoring and other network monitoring tools allow IT professionals to gain visibility into upgrade points and observe application behaviour. Though many organisations may not see the IPv6 light, it has never been more important to make the switch, in tandem with using available technologies, to preserve the integrity and security of today's computing infrastructure.""

That also means making sure your network equipment vendors can deliver the goods. Chris Crotteau, senior technical engineer at Network Hardware Resaler, US-based sellers of second-hand network gear, warns: ""Describing a device as IPv6 capable does not necessarily imply that the unit has the needed IPv6 features called for by any particular deployment; that a device can process IPv6 traffic at the same rate as IPv4 traffic; or that the system has sufficient resources available to simultaneously process IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.""

Though many organisations may not see the IPv6 light, it has never been more important to make the switch. – Chris Smithee, Lancope

Fiocco, however, suggests that your equipment may be up to the job. ""If you bought edge routers or security devices within the last three-four years, saddling up for IPv6 is probably as easy as a software update."" Otherwise, you're looking at a refresh of your IT infrastructure.

So, according to Fiocco, ""The bottom line: if your client is on IPv6, it's in your business's best interest to switch. And with AT&T alone projecting five million [US] households [on IPv6] by the end of 2012, alongside explosive 4G growth, chances are many clients and consumers are getting there, if they are not already.""

While IPv6 may still be a trickle today, it's soon going to be a flood, and the sooner you start making the change the better.

96,96,FL-2012-000100-CHN,Sellur handloom units in throes of extinction - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/sellur-handloom-units-in-throes-of-extinction/article3514474.ece,"Buildings that housed handloom units till 1990s are now book binding units, confectionaries and workshops

“As a young woman, the moment I got down from the city bus at Sellur stop the all pervading noise of handlooms used to give me a headache. Today, I hear the eerie silence of the once famous handloom units, that are now languishing in the company of cobwebs.” This is how T. Annalakshmi, a handloom worker, sums up the status of the industry.

From around 10, 000 looms and 12, 000 workers in the beginning of this century, the handloom industry in Sellur now employs around 1,000 workers in about 600 looms. The decline and fall began in November 1993, when a devastating flood submerged Sellur where many handlooms were not covered against natural calamity. With no help coming from anywhere, the units started to close down one by one and workers started to migrate to Karur, Chennimalai, Vellakoil and Tirupur. Those who migrated to Sellur from dry districts like Ramanathapuram have returned home. Hundreds and hundreds of handlooms have fallen silent. Even the residual work force favours other manual work, which fetches them a few hundreds a day. But those who still remain in the industry get wages between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,000 a month, depending on the work they do.

Earning even this paltry sum has become difficult with the strike for wage revision, which began on May 25. T. Maheswari earns Rs. 1,500 a month. Her husband and daughter, who are also in the industry, chip in with Rs. 2,000 each. Every June, she is forced to take a loan of Rs. 10, 000 to Rs. 15, 000 from the self-help group, in which she is a member, to send her son to school. The loan is repaid at the rate of Rs. 250 a month. The family pays Rs. 1,000 for a single room house and a shocking electricity bill of around Rs. 500. “We do not attend family functions for fear of increasing our debts,” says Ms. Maheswari. Forty-three-year-old A. Gomathi, daughter of handloom workers, started working when she was seven years old. “We find it difficult to add vegetables in our daily menu. ‘Sambar' is rare in our households,” she says.

90 per cent is women

Over 90 per cent of the Sellur work force is women. They have virtually grown up hearing the noise of handlooms. “We slept under the handlooms and played around them as children. We do not want to go out of Sellur for employment. At the same time, we cannot involve our children in this dying industry,” says M. Selvi. These women earn around Rs. 60 per day but do not have work all through the year. When it rains it becomes more difficult. The Re one a kg rice provided in ration shops is godsend for them. However, they are not happy with the quality of rice supplied now. They are also dependent on the health insurance cover provided by the government. Even a cup of tea is a luxury for them. “Every day, four of us get together, pay Rs. 2 each for a cup of tea that costs Rs. 8 and share it,” says T. Annalakshmi.

The handloom workers start sending their children for work once they finish high school. One of the workers is happy that she sent her first daughter for work in a mill in Coimbatore district under the infamous ‘Sumangali Thittam.' “The mill management paid us Rs. 25, 000 after three years of work. I got her married with the money,” she says. In this background, the workers are looking up to the handloom manufacturers to enhance their wages.

S. Murugan, district secretary of handloom workers' union affiliated to the CITU, points out that the handloom industry has been affected by several factors that are beyond its control, as Sellur is predominantly export-dependent. The political or economic turmoil elsewhere directly affects the handloom industry here. About 50 per cent of the export order for about 40, 000 handlooms vanished when the Soviet Union broke away in 1986. The floods of November 3, 1993, sounded the death knell.

Then came the Pokran test, which led to the boycott of Indian goods, including handloom products by several countries.

In 2010, the number shrunk to 3,000 looms. The other factor, according to Mr. Murugan, is the reduction in list of goods reserved for handlooms, from 22 to 11 items. Now, the powerlooms are producing goods meant for the handloom sector, he says.

Explaining the predicament of the industry from the point of view of Sellur Handloom Textiles Manufacturers' Association, its president, G. Subash Chandra Bose, says that the industry is run by families without any government support. Rebates, subsidies and loan waiver available for cooperative handloom weavers' societies are not offered to the private sector. There is also the issue of wage revision and bonus cropping up once in two years. “We give 21 paise as bonus for every rupee earned by the employee every year. The minimum bonus payable, under government norms, is 8.33 per cent. Bonus is disbursed thrice a year – for three months during Pongal and local temple festival and for six months during Deepavali. We understand the plight of the workers and are ready to offer a reasonable revision this year,” he says.

Factors

The other factors that compound the woes of the Sellur handloom industry is the rising prices of yarn. In the last two years, the price of a five kg bundle of yarn has gone up from Rs. 600 to Rs. 1,000 due to power cut. The handloom units also find it difficult to compete with power looms. “A power loom produces 60 pieces of a particular variety of towel per day. In handloom, the workers can manage only five to six pieces,” explains Mr. Bose. Sellur products are also not able to compete with countries like China and Pakistan in the export market. “The government should think of providing incentives to the private handlooms also to ensure their survival,” says Mr. Bose.

The overriding factor here is shortage of skilled manpower. R. Sethuraman, who owned six looms and a yarn processing unit till 1995, is working in a handloom unit as a worker.

“I could not find anybody in the new generation to take up the units from me. Even my son could not run them successfully as he was not skilled,” says Mr. Sethuraman. There is no training centre to pass on the skills to the new generation.

The huge buildings that housed handloom units till the early 1990s now have turned into book binding units, confectionaries and workshops.

Mr Key confirmed the Queen’s lady-in-waiting had briefed him that Queen Elizabeth wanted to talk about the future of the Cathedral after a flood of letters.

The Queen is the nominal head of the Anglican church in Britain, though not New Zealand.

“The Queen has had an extraordinarily large amount of correspondence in relation to the Christchurch Cathedral,” Mr Key said.

“She will certainly want an update on what’s happening there. We will be able to provide her with the best information we have and hopefully some reassurance the rebuild is being undertaken as speedily as the government can.”

Mr Key said the correspondence reflected the relationship the Queen had with the Anglican church but “at the end of the day we are the executive Government and it is our responsibility to carry out those actions.

“All I’ll be able to do is give her the same reassurance I give Cantabrians, that if we could save the church we would, but on the best advice we’ve had so far that church cant’t be saved because of the damage.

“I think the important issue is ultimately working out what goes on that site next and how we preserve as much of the old Cathedral and maybe reintegrate that in a new building constructed there; that’s why they are very carefully going through the deconstruction process.”

Mr Key said he understood the Queens desire for reassurance “but at the end of the day the Queen isn’t an engineer and nether am I and I so she won’t be able to override the engineering advice we’ve had.”

The meeting with the Queen was not confirmed till after Mr Key arrived in London for her diamond jubilee celebrations, which wrapped up yesterday.

During her 60 year, the Queen has visited New Zealand 10 times and Mr Key acknowledged it was unlikely she would ever return.

“I think that will be quite a stretch.”

She had made it clear to him that the trip was probably too long for someone her age and she was handing over the mantle to younger members of the Royal family.
