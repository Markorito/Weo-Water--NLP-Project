Description of the disaster

A severe weather warning covering the period May-June has been issued by the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG, Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika) covering several parts of Indonesia, including Aceh, Riau, Riau Islands, Bengkulu, South Sumatra, West Nusa Tenggara, South Sulawesi, and several parts of Kalimantan. The BMKG warning indicated that heavy rain would continue until the end of May 2020 in East Kalimantan, particularly in the northern area where the upstream of Karang Mumus river is located.

In line with this forecast, heavy and intense rain on Thursday to Friday (21 to 22 May 2020) has submerged 11 villages of eight sub-districts in Samarinda city, East Kalimantan province. In addition to the heavy rainfall, the flooding was triggered by a rise in water level at the Karang Mumus river and Benanga dam. Responding to this event, the mayor of Samarinda city has declared a 14-day emergency response period from 22 May ‚Äì 4 June 2020.

As many as 12.651 households/ 41.837 people have been affected, one person is heavily injured and at least four people have died in the aftermath of the flood, while 605 people had been evacuated to safer places. As per 30 May, there are 43 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Samarinda, four of which have been admitted into hospital for treatment, one death has resulted while 38 people have recovered. A further, 1,920 people are currently under observation and 108 patients are being isolated and observed in the hospital. Due to the COVID-19 situation, Samarinda City Disaster Management Agency (BPBD Kota Samarinda) decided not to establish IDP centres. The majority of the displaced are from Sungai Pinang sub-district and as of 26 May 2020, they had been evacuated to their relative‚Äôs houses. As 27 May, 346 people were still displaced at PKK building (Pemberdayaan Kesejahteraan Keluarga, Family Welfare Movement).

This number is expected to decrease as the water recedes.

Residential areas remained flooded with water level reaching between 60 ‚Äì 150 cm. Six houses are severely damaged.

Three school buildings, six houses of prayers and a state-owned building have also been affected. The state electricity company has temporarily shut down electricity for safety reasons after the heavy rains. As a result, the community are using candles, emergency lights and generators as lighting. Some of the main roads leading to the flooded areas are still inundated with a depth between 30-60 cm, making it difficult for two and four-wheeled vehicles to access the areas.

Based on last years‚Äô experience and BMKG forecast of extreme weather, dry season is imminent. Kalimantan is one of the regions prone to forest and peat fire. This not only affected people throughout Kalimantan but also cross-border countries. Almost all Kalimantan branches were responding to the event last year. In East Kalimatan province alone, at least 93 potential hotspots have been identified. PMI has conducted a meeting to discuss the importance of preparedness in anticipation of the incoming forest and one of the recommendation is to formulate a Business Continuity Plan for Kalimantan region that includes all the branches, which will be supported by PMI NHQ.","Tue, 02 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1520547-MDRID015do.png?itok=HJ4ZuKHo,"['epoa', 'east', 'affected', 'city', 'water', 'bmkg', 'operation', '2020', 'mdrid015', 'samarinda', 'floods', 'heavy', 'houses', 'emergency', 'indonesia', 'plan', 'kalimantan', 'n']",

Officials have issued a warning and cautioned local residents to remain alert for any updates, as more flooding can be expected today.

‚ÄúThis can have an impact of disrupting transportation around ports and shores, the activities of salt farmers and inland fisheries, as well as unloading and loading activities at the port,‚Äù a statement from the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) issued yesterday, reads.

Coastal floods are predicted to occur in several areas across Indonesia, such as the western shores of Lampung, as well as the southern shores of Java and West Nusa Tenggara (NTB). BMKG further cautions local residents to remain alert and anticipate the impacts of the coastal floods, while also keeping track of the latest updates from the agency.

2,2,FF-2020-000140-IDN,Fighting climate change: Inspiration from an Indonesian national hero - Jakarta Post,http://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2020/06/05/fighting-climate-change-inspiration-from-an-indonesian-national-hero.html,"Growing up, I didn‚Äôt always realize the incredible privilege of having a grandfather who was a national hero. The government declared my grandfather Herman Johannes a national hero in 2009 for his role in leading the Indonesian Army‚Äôs Arsenal Lab during the National Revolution.

Opa, as I call him, was born in a small village on Rote Island in 1912. He had a vibrant career, serving as minister of public works, serving on UNESCO‚Äôs executive board and helping to reform the Indonesian language. However, Indonesians probably remember him most fondly as a Gadjah Mada University professor and as the university‚Äôs second rector. Many people may also recognize him as the guy on the 100 rupiah coin.

Much has been written about my Opa and his life. Yet most articles tend to leave out one of the most important things about him ‚Äî his dedication to protecting the environment. For World Environment Day, I want to highlight my grandfather‚Äôs spirit of conservation.

During his lifetime, from 1912 to 1992, my Opa observed how the heavy reliance on firewood by many of the residents of his community was potentially leading to forest degradation in the area. Around the world, wood fuel remains the dominant source of energy for billions of people, especially for the rural poor in developing countries. Although wood is considered a renewable source of energy, overexploitation can result in deforestation.

My Opa, seeing this issue, developed biomass briquettes and introduced them to local communities. Created easily from waste such as dry leaves, weeds and grass, the briquettes provided a cleaner, cheaper alternative to firewood and kerosene. Besides that, he campaigned for reforestation efforts throughout Indonesia and became a sharp critic of selective logging practices.

Indonesia‚Äôs growing number of vehicles and the country‚Äôs large dependence on oil greatly concerned him as well. He believed adamantly that Indonesia‚Äôs energy future rested in solar, hydro, geothermal and nuclear power. He believed it was time for Indonesia to make the necessary transitions, warning of the devastating changes to the climate that would come if we didn‚Äôt. That was 40 years ago.

Today, the world lives in a climate emergency. Nowhere is that more evident than in the Indonesian archipelago. Jakarta, the fastest-sinking city in the world, began 2020 with the worst flooding in over a decade. The floods left dozens dead and tens of thousands of residents displaced.

The rising sea level has taken away Indonesian lives, Indonesian livelihoods and even Indonesians islands themselves. Two islands have disappeared since the start of the year and more are set to follow.

Despite experiencing the effects of climate change first hand, Indonesia is a hotbed of climate change denial. A YouGov and University of Cambridge survey found that 18 percent of Indonesians believe that climate change is unrelated to human behavior. While climate change denial is largely attributed to the lack of environmental education, it also doesn‚Äôt help that the Indonesian government has very little regard for science.

President Joko ‚ÄúJokowi‚Äù Widodo‚Äôs disregard for scientists has never been more clear than during this coronavirus pandemic. Furthermore, Jokowi‚Äôs job creation bill, popularly known as the omnibus bill, which would eliminate environmental impact assessments as a requirement for businesses, is another example of the President‚Äôs dangerous disregard for science.

Indonesia‚Äôs anti-science attitudes would certainly break my Opa's heart. Being a scientist was a core part of his identity. But it‚Äôs crucial to understand that my Opa's passion for environmental protection stemmed from beyond him being a scientist.

I believe much of it also had to do with him being a patriot. As someone who fought for Indonesian independence, he strongly believed in the advancement of the Indonesian people. He cared about bettering the lives of Indonesians in the lowest levels of society. I believe that‚Äôs at the heart of why he cared so deeply about conservation. He understood the intrinsic link between social justice and environmental justice.

Scientists today remind us that the world‚Äôs poor will suffer the most from the catastrophic effects of climate change. If my Opa were alive today, I can‚Äôt imagine him anywhere but at the forefront of fighting this climate crisis. He would be holding polluters and our complicit leaders accountable and demanding action. He wouldn‚Äôt stand idly by as those who refuse to hear the climate wake-up calls jeopardize the futures of millions of Indonesians.

National hero is the highest title the Indonesian government can bestow on a person. It‚Äôs an extremely small and exclusive club to belong to. Less than 200 individuals have been awarded the honor. There‚Äôs a sense of gravity in declaring a person a national hero. When the government bestows the title on a person, they are choosing to make a public statement. They‚Äôre choosing to say to every Indonesian that that person‚Äôs life was significant and they are worthy of our honor.

I‚Äôve been thinking about the ways we honor our national heroes. We build statues in their likeness, we name places after them and we put their faces on our currency. But are those the ways we should be honoring our national heroes?

As a granddaughter of a national hero, here‚Äôs how I want my Opa to be honored. Honor my Opa by embodying the values of conservation he stood for. Honor him by caring about the poor. And honor him by taking the climate crisis seriously. Our national heroes fought for us to have a nation, now let‚Äôs fight to make sure it has a future.

The death toll from Tropical Storm Amanda in Central America rose to 26 even as a new storm was forming in the Gulf of Mexico, reports said on Tuesday.

El Salvador and neighboring Guatemala and Honduras were lashed by torrential rains and high winds after Amanda swept in from the Pacific on Sunday, causing floods and power cuts.

The death toll in El Salvador, which bore the brunt of the storm, rose from 16 to 20, the environment ministry said on Tuesday.

One of seven people reported missing there was however found alive, said Carolina Recinos, a senior official in San Salvador, who also said 2,000 homes were ""completely destroyed.""

Nearly 8,000 people were evacuated from high-risk areas and transferred to shelters.

With Tropical Storm Cristobal expected to bring further heavy rains to already waterlogged soil, the environment ministry has warned of ""a high probability of many landslides and falling rocks.""

Four people died in Honduras after they were swept away by the current.

The rains caused flooding and landslides in several regions of the country, officials said.

Two people were also killed and two injured in Guatemala, where authorities reported 500 homes damaged.","Wed, 03 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/06/03/2020_06_03_96797_1591176962._large.jpg,"['america', 'rises', 'central', 'salvador', 'death', 'tropical', '26', 'rains', 'amanda', 'san', 'reported', 'swept', 'storm', 'ministry', 'toll', 'rose']",

In the village of 1,200 residents, rows of houses sit low to the ground beside the water, buttressed on the other side by swampy peatlands.

Read more: Peatlands: Neglected piece of the climate puzzle

The natural environment has long sustained the life of this village on the island of Sumatra. But now 48-year-old Alfian is struggling. ""The fish are gone from the river,"" he says. ""It's barely enough for daily survival.""

Rukam residents say a decline in water quality and draining of peatlands has impacted fishing

Alfian remembers when many fish species lived in the peatlands. He could feed his family for a week with the money from one day's catch.

The fate of both Alfian's daily catch and Rukam itself is intertwined with that of an estimated US $60 billion-dollar industry.

Indonesia sits at the heart of the global palm oil trade. In 2002, it arrived on the banks of Rukam when the Indonesian company PT Erasakti Wira Forestama (EWF) offered the villagers a one-time payment for their land.

Some villagers resisted. Syafei, a 68-year-old who was chief of Rukam at the time, advocated for joint ownership and management of the lands between villagers and the company. But he says some residents pressured him to accept the terms.

They were offered roughly ‚Ç¨55,000 (700 million Rupiah, $62,333 according to conversation rates at the time) for approximately 2,300 hectares (5684 acres) in total.

""At that time, that amount of money was really huge,"" says Syafei. The villagers were ""yearning for the compensation.""

In the end the community sold the land. Valuable peatlands were converted to plantations ‚Äî and the repercussions of the decision are still felt today.

The environmental cost of palm oil

Touted as a wonder commodity, palm oil is found in a vast array of products and has been an undeniable driver of economic growth in the country.

But the environment has paid the price ‚Äî namely through deforestation, loss of biodiversity, soil degradation, and polluted water and air.

Slash-and-burn techniques, used to clear large swathes of land for plantations, are particularly devastating in peatlands like those found in Rukam. Peatlands are made up of thick layers of decomposed organic material and burning them releases huge amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.

Rukam's residents have witnessed their landscape transform since they sold their land.

The peatlands were drained to make them usable for palm oil. A water pump brought in for irrigation disrupted the natural flow of water, redirecting it from the river to the plantation ‚Äî which made it difficult for Rukam's residents' to access water for their own fields.

The situation worsened when a flood dam, used to protect the oil palm plantation from flooding, was built in 2009.

""As a consequence, villagers experience more damaging floods in the rainy season and don't have enough water in the dry season,"" says Rudiansyah, from WALHI, Indonesia's largest environmental organization. Farming has become difficult.

The profits from the sale of land, which were split evenly among residents, were not long-lasting. In fact, Rudiansyah claims Rukam's economy shrank significantly after the land conversion. While there is no data from before EWF came to the village, a study from WALHI and the University of Jambi found 366 of 494 families in Rukam were considered ""poor"" or ""very poor"" in 2018.

A 2018 study showed high rates of poverty in Rukam

WALHI and many villagers put this down primarily to the loss of fishing ground due to the palm oil expansion.

Residents say the lakes they used to fish in disappeared after the land conversion and that they've seen fish stocks dramatically decline. When peatlands were drained many valuable species lost their breeding grounds. Now, there are only 53 fishermen, making around ‚Ç¨8 ($8.70) per day.

With few alternatives left, many residents have turned to working on the palm oil plantations to earn a living.

Roughly 150 people, or about 16% of the village, work on the EWF plantation, which covers more than 4,000 hectares of land between the Batang Hari and the Kumpeh rivers.

""The only way to survive is to work on the plantation,"" says Hikmawati, a 35-year-old Rukam resident. Hikmawati worked distributing fertilizer on the plantation but eventually quit because of the high workload and low wages.

Now Hikmawati is trying to earn a living as a seamstress, while her husband works as a driver for the few remaining fishermen.

Loss and regret

Hikmawati can't imagine any future for Rukam and would turn back the clock if she could: ""I'd go back to the olden days where we could grow rice, or when there were still plenty of fish around.""

She's not alone. ""When I see the vanishing forest, I feel sad... The future looks bleak,"" fisherman Alfian says. ""If nothing changes, then the next generation will leave, and this village will go extinct. Because there is nothing to live for anymore.""

Alfian expects he will be the last in the family line of fishermen. ""Maybe my children will only learn the names and types of fish that used to live here,"" he says.

For former village chief Syafei, regret is tinged with frustration: ""Everything I had planned for the future has gone to the bottom of the ocean because they didn't want to listen to me.""

Syafei remembers when the villagers were able to depend on natural seasons in Rukam

Many in the community feel a sense of loss, and not just concerning their livelihood. ""Countless species of medicinal plants are also lost because of the land conversion from peat forest to plantation,"" says Rudiansyah.

It's a response common to many villages impacted by the industry. ""There is without question an enormous amount of regret for those communities,"" says Terry Sunderland, a senior scientist with the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR).

""Rukam's story is actually representative for a lot of the villages in Indonesia that are engaging palm oil,"" says Erik Meijaard, a conservation scientist and chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature palm oil task force.

""Certain communities benefit from palm oil, but for communities in which residents go fishing or hunting or collecting plants as part of their livelihoods, they tend to lose out quite badly when palm oil goes in and cuts down the forest, because you've got major environmental impacts.""

Rukam's experience of the negative consequences of palm oil have been shared by other villages in Indonesia

A study out of Kalimantan, Indonesia, found a marked decline in social and environmental well-being in communities with oil palm plantations between 2000 and 2014 ‚Äî particularly those, like Rukam, that relied on subsistence-based livelihoods.

Read more: Brazil's Amazon rainforest has become the Wild West for illegal gold miners

According to Rudiansyah, Rukam is an unusual case because it chose to sell its land as opposed to many communities plagued by conflicts with palm oil companies.

But Sunderland argues fully informed consent is often lacking: ""People should be able to make a decision based on the full knowledge of what the implications are. And that's not the case ‚Äî palm oil is sold as the financial answer to communities' problems.... Palm oil companies negotiate very disingenuously and essentially don't provide all the information.""

Malaysia and Indonesia are the biggest global producers of palm oil

As part of the concession agreement with the local government, EWF made regular corporate responsibility payments to Rukam, used to build infrastructure in the village.

Still, some villagers now say they were misled about the impact on water and degradation of their peatland forest.

""At that time [of the sale] we didn't know the impact will be like this. It wasn't known to us that there was a plan to build the dam,"" says Alfian.

""Flooding wasn't even a problem [before], not like now where the water has become dark and murky, probably caused by the pollution from the plantation,"" says Hikmawati. Although no official study has been carried out, residents have accused the company of dumping chemicals in the river.

EWF has not responded to requests for comment on these allegations.

""The company should have been fair towards the villagers, not trying to destroy their livelihood, but to embrace them as strategic partners,"" says Rudiansyah, arguing lack of proper education in the community also played a role.

Wildfires and mixed progress

Despite established criteria from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in data from 2018, only 19% of palm oil produced globally was certified sustainable. Furthermore, Greenpeace have argued deforestation continues to happen even among certified palm oil companies.

Intense wildfires in recent years have damaged significant areas of forest and peatland in Indonesia

The Indonesian government has frequently touted the economic benefits of the industry. However, in the wake of the 2015 wildfires, which destroyed 2.6 million hectares of land including large swathes of peatland, the government took steps that earned international praise.

Read more: The search for sustainable palm oil

The Peatland Restoration Agency (BRG) was set up in 2016 and by the end of 2018, it had restored more than 679,000 hectares. In 2019, the same year as more intense wildfires hit the country, the Indonesian government also issued a permanent moratorium on new forest clearance for activities like palm oil development and logging.

But not all are convinced of the progress.

Watch video 03:19 How the world got addicted to palm oil

""[Palm oil] companies benefit from poorly enforced laws, which in some cases are also poorly drafted,"" says Sol Gosetti from Greenpeace, referring to the creation of the BRG and renewed government action against companies destroying forests and peatland, such as mandating punitive fines and revoking licenses.

""The intentions [of government plans] seemed good, but there has been very mixed follow up and research in the field shows that the plantation sector is still not changing its practices,"" says Gosetti. ""In the meantime, a number of plantation companies continue expansion; clearing forests and draining wet, carbon-rich peatlands.""

Despite the moratorium, a Greenpeace investigation in 2019 found that more than 1 million hectares had been burned in protected areas. The government has also been criticized for a failure to enforce industry transparency or regulations and tackle human rights abuses.

Peatland regeneration

Yet at the local level, some see reasons to believe the peatlands have a future.

Panace, 39, is a farmer living in Pematang Rahim, a village not far from Rukam. He used to cultivate palm oil on peatlands, but found it was very expensive as a smallholder farmer and was degrading the soil.

Watch video 00:31 Panace, farmer in Indonesia

Now he is one of many farmers working to rehabilitate their land through the peat restoration program. The first step is rewetting the peatlands by installing infrastructure like deep wells and canal blockings to redistribute water. Then trees and other crops are replanted to repairdamaged land.

""We are going to continue diversifying our own crops and try to establish polyculture,"" says Panace. ""We have started with Pinang palm ‚Äî which grows well in peatlands and has a higher price on the market than palm oil fruits ‚Äî and so far, it looks really promising.""

The program depends on the willingness of both farmers and palm oil companies to participate but Panace believes education is key in the future. The program also works with community groups, NGOs and universities to promote the advantages of peatland restoration.

For generations, the forest and river have sustained the livelihoods of Rukam's residents

Change will not happen overnight. ""Peatland recovery takes decades, while restoration activities have only been running for four years,"" says Myrna Safitri, from BRG. But once established on a broad scale it could help mitigate the spread of wildfires.

While restoration has not yet reached Rukam, not all residents are resigned to their village's fate.

Following pressure from the region's provincial government and WALHI, EWF has agreed to meet three demands of the villagers in Rukam, set to be put into effect this year: To repair the health of the soil, to help residents set up rice fields and irrigation systems, and to restore the water source for agriculture and clean drinking water.

This comes almost two decades after the decision that changed everything for Rukam. ""Years ago, we only needed to take what nature provided for us,"" laments Syafei. ""Our entire way of life was dependent on the natural rhythm of the seasons.""

But he hasn't completely given up hope there is still time to recognize what is at stake. ""If we don't learn from the past, then this village might disappear.""","Fri, 05 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/53575274_6.jpg,"['villagers', 'indonesian', 'struggling', 'water', 'palm', 'industry', 'oil', 'loss', 'rukam', 'village', 'residents', 'leaves', 'land', 'regret', 'plantation', 'peatlands']",

Noodle expert Tirta Lie shared his insight on the frozen noodles market with The Jakarta Post. He also gave a fair warning that a pouch of frozen noodles cannot replace the sensory experience of being served a fresh bowl of the delicacy at stalls scattered in North or West Jakarta.

‚ÄúOf course, eating noodles in a restaurant is more enjoyable than cooking them at home, because not every person can cook noodles the right way,‚Äù he told the Post on Thursday.

Nevertheless, Tirta awarded the prestigious ‚ÄúTirta Lie Approved‚Äù seal to 42 brands of frozen noodles.

The Tirta Lie Approved seal is a form of appreciation to a dish he deems delicious, a sort of guidance for his followers on Instagram for their own palate adventures.

‚ÄúThe public knows that Tirta Lie's reviews are not paid endorsements. All reviews are legit. If it's delicious, then I say it's delicious. If it's not tasty, I won't talk about it further in social media, but I will give input privately to the cook,‚Äù he said.

Tirta said many noodle sellers had invited him to come and eat at their places to get reviewed, but he said he would prefer if the sellers were not aware that he's coming.

‚ÄúIf I come without notice, I get the real flavor and I still pay for the food. If it's tasty, I will award them the seal without them having to pay me,‚Äù he said.

He added that brands may use the seal as part of their marketing for free as long as they promise to maintain the quality of the product.

Some of the brands that have received Tirta's approval were awarded an A++ label, signifying extraordinary quality.

According to Tirta, a frozen dish with the A++ label is not only delicious but also carefully packaged, so that the content quality is protected.

‚ÄúThe packaging should be made of good materials, preferably transparent, so we can see the content. It also has to contain complete information of production and expiry date, as well as cooking suggestions and a halal or non-halal label,"" he said.

Below is a list of frozen noodle pouches with the A++ Tirta Lie Approved seal you can add to your next grocery shopping:

Bakmi Ayam Jamur Roemah Ganyem

According to Tirta, this is one of the best halal frozen noodles you can buy today. He said that although the noodles do not contain pork and lard‚Äîwidely believed to be the key to delicious dishes‚Äîthe noodles were very tasty and well packaged. They are available via WhatsApp and Tokopedia.

Bakmi Holiaw

Tirta believes that Bakmi Holiaw is a five-star noodle maker in town.

The noodles contain pork, and the joint is among the most popular for noodle lovers.

You can order their noodles via WhatsApp at 081310581188.

Pangsit Mie 168

As one of the first to get the A++ label in the pouch noodle category, Tirta said, this brand had the best ingredients and taste.

9,9,FF-2020-000140-IDN,Can Indonesia build a 'green' capital in a biodiversity hotspot? - Eco-Business,https://www.eco-business.com/news/can-indonesia-build-a-green-capital-in-a-biodiversity-hotspot/,"Last year, President Joko ‚ÄúJokowi‚Äù Widodo announced that Indonesia would move its government from Jakarta to a new capital city that will be built in East Kalimantan province, on the island of Borneo, near the geographic centre of the country.



Planning has begun, and pre-construction is due to start later this year, with the first phase of the move scheduled for 2024, although Covid-19 is expected to delay things.



The government is betting on the private sector, including international investors, to help pay for at least 80 per cent of the project. China is reportedly interested in designing energy and waste-management infrastructure, and the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank has also agreed to get involved.

But Indonesia‚Äôs proposed new capital has raised concerns from environmentalists. The location is about 50 kilometres inland from the existing port city of Balikpapan, adjacent to two nature reserves and close to the habitat of critically endangered forest-dwelling species including orangutans and proboscis monkeys.



‚ÄúOur main concern is the new capital will contribute to deforestation,‚Äù said Jasmine Puteri, senior forest campaigner with Greenpeace, Indonesia. Deforestation could lead to more forest fires, which are already an issue in Borneo.

Another concern is the potential for wetlands loss and degradation of mangrove habitat in Balikpapan Bay.



‚ÄúThere are a lot of mangroves‚Ä¶ and when you build a city in an area that contains a huge cover of wetlands, it increases the risk of flooding due to watershed instability,‚Äù said Zuraidah Said, forest and climate research analyst at the World Resources Institute, Indonesia.



Paving over a large area of forest land could also increase runoff and result in greater flooding in downstream Balikpapan.



East Kalimantan is a major coal-producing province that supplies more-populous Java and also exports to China and India. An influx of people could lead to renewed calls to build more coal power generation for the new city.



‚ÄúEast Kalimantan still has considerable coal reserves,‚Äù said Laurens Bakker, assistant professor in the anthropology department at the University of Amsterdam. He is part of a research team focused on the new capital project, alongside colleagues in Indonesia. ‚ÄúHaving more power plants that use coal is not the best way forward.‚Äù

To address those concerns, Indonesia‚Äôs planning agency, and President Jokowi, have stated that the new capital will be ‚Äúsmart, green and clean‚Äù. They‚Äôve pledged to limit the development site to former oil and timber plantations and other land already in use. Deforestation will be prohibited and green reserves will be maintained around the city as a buffer. Clean energy use will be prioritised.



‚ÄúIt is spoken about as if the government is taking this in all seriousness,‚Äù said Bakker. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs one way to make a city green, do it from the moment you start building it.‚Äù

The role of international investors

Under President Jokowi, Indonesia has heavily courted international investment in large-scale infrastructure projects, including several connected to China‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative. The Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail project, the Sumsel 1 coal-fired power plant and Batung Toru hydropower plant in Sumatra, are all examples of Chinese financed joint-ventures, and potential models for infrastructure development related to the new capital city.



Few of those projects would fit under a green city model. Since 2005, China has attempted to shift from rapid unplanned urbanisation towards sustainable urban development by developing several eco-cities domestically. However, it‚Äôs not always clear what an eco-city is, according to Austin Williams, an assistant professor at Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong-Liverpool University, and author of China‚Äôs Urban Revolution: Understanding Chinese Eco-cities.



‚ÄúChina is simply using the fact that there is no definition to define whatever it pleases to be an eco-city,‚Äù he said.



Williams says the model is less important than the individual technologies and how they are applied. Several technologies associated with Chinese eco-cities ‚Äì mass transit, renewable energy, and efficient water use ‚Äì could be utilised in Indonesia. The more important lesson might be that small changes can have big impacts too.



‚ÄúChina is now realising that you do not have to invest massively in environmental technology,‚Äù said Williams. Instead of investing more in solar panels, wind turbines and public transport, it is ‚Äúcreating parks, including insulation in buildings [and] improving the efficiency of drainage and waste disposal,‚Äù he added.

Indonesia‚Äôs new capital will bring specific challenges due to its tropical forest location, which is unlike any of the eco-cities in China, or green development projects in Europe or the United States.



‚ÄúThere are so many concepts of ‚Äòforest city‚Äô available in many countries, but we are trying to conceptualise it into Indonesia‚Äôs context,‚Äù said Hendricus ‚ÄúAndy‚Äù Simarmata, president of the Indonesian Association of Urban and Regional Planners.



Like China and elsewhere, whether the as-yet-unnamed capital city is green will depend on just how ‚Äúgreen‚Äù and ‚Äúclean‚Äù are defined. Indonesia‚Äôs history of megaprojects harming landscapes is why many want to see details first before giving the project their blessing.



‚ÄúThe concept is not really clear yet,‚Äù said Jasmine. ‚ÄúIf they are clear and transparent about the strategies and planning, then it is possible to be achieved. But since they are not, that‚Äôs an issue.‚Äù

What to watch out for

Indonesia is making its new capital a global project. The advisory board includes representatives from Japan, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. US and Japanese companies are playing a key role in the design phase. Many expect that Chinese involvement will grow too. The initial designs and plan are expected later this year.



‚ÄúThe first thing I and my colleagues will be watching for is the layout for the city‚Ä¶ where it is going to be and how it is going to take into account such elements as drainage, clean air and pollution,‚Äù said Bakker. ‚ÄúI am also curious about the extent to which there will be expertise in environmentally neutral building being taken into account from [abroad].‚Äù



According to Andy, the government has brought in a diverse range of experts, including himself, to help draw up the plans and define the meaning of ‚Äúsmart, green and clean‚Äù. He is hopeful for something that balances urban and environmental needs.

‚ÄúThey are aware of the biodiversity hotspot location of the new capital, the mangroves, wetlands and, in the highlands, the forest coverage,‚Äù said Andy. He added that preliminary studies for the strategic environmental and social impact assessment have been completed and more detailed assessment will continue this year.



This will all be integrated into a master plan for the new city, to be released by Indonesia‚Äôs planning agency later this year. Andy hopes that by June or July, it will be possible to begin charting a timeline for when the project will break ground.



While Covid-19 has slowed things down, the government‚Äôs plans remain ambitious. The country is even looking to have the unbuilt city put in a bid to host the 2032 Olympic Games ‚Äì the ultimate showcase for the emerging economy, but also for what could be a model for ecological urban development in a tropical landscape.

10,10,FF-2020-000140-IDN,Going local: Lessons from Covid response in Indonesia - The Interpreter,https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/going-local-lessons-covid-response-indonesia,"Covid-19 and the significant changes it presents are forcing new ways of working, including for humanitarian responders. In Indonesia, the government response to the crisis has been criticised internally and internationally as slow and lacking transparency. Senior government figures downplayed the crisis in its early days, and agencies and the public struggled to get reliable information about the prevalence of the disease.

As the public has pushed for more action and information in order to better understand and respond to the unfolding emergency, civil society groups, particularly those well versed in disaster management and humanitarian response, have quickly taken action. The results have shown not only what is possible in the Indonesian context, but also pointed a way towards reform that the international humanitarian system has talked about for years but has never really seen materialise.

The 2016 World Humanitarian Summit (WHS), the first of its kind, identified many of the major challenges to the humanitarian system and how the global professional community could address them. One example is a focus on strengthening and empowering local leadership, rather than reinforcing the dominance of international humanitarian actors, including in coordination mechanisms, as well as closing the gap between traditional long-term development actors, peacebuilders and humanitarian responders.

SEJAJAR presents an opportunity for learning about local leadership at multiple levels, and how to improve collaboration between people within and outside the traditional humanitarian system.

Despite the best intentions of the reform agenda and a plethora of commitments, progress has been hampered by persistent bureaucratic barriers and a lack of evidence of change.

Recent research suggests that Indonesia is a prime candidate for testing an approach to country-led reform. Following the devastating earthquakes and tsunamis that struck Lombok and Central Sulawesi in 2018, the country took major steps to localise humanitarian response and to empower national actors to drive decision-making. This decision surprised many agencies, and forced adoption of the new ways of working promoted at the WHS in 2016.

While the localisation agenda has gained widespread recognition, in some countries it has been largely rhetoric. Indonesia‚Äôs policy compelled the necessary shift in power dynamics and the roles and responsibilities of humanitarian actors. In the Sulawesi relief effort, national organisations took the place of big international agencies, and civil society groups and first responders were given priority. Indonesia has also made progress in optimising humanitarian coordination, inviting national networks to join the UN-led Humanitarian Country Team, the main forum for coordination and strategy. Further, the government has formally adopted the cluster approach, which aims at improving planning and efficiency within specific areas of need, such as health, food, logistics or sanitation.

As the Covid-19 crisis unfolded in Indonesia, the groundwork laid by those developments helped enable a locally driven response and coordination effort. The Pujiono Centre for Disaster and Climate Risk Reduction Studies provides a clear example of effective local action. The Centre acted quickly to pivot its emerging coordination platform into a Covid-19 response network. From simple beginnings in early March, the SEJAJAR network-of-networks has grown to include 25 national networks across sectors, and nearly to 600 sub-national level organisations across 34 provinces, including Nusa Tenggara Timur, Central Sulawesi and West Papua.

SEJAJAR, an acronym of Sekretariat Jaringan-antar-Jaringan (OMS-LSM in Bahasa Indonesia), means equal in English, with the aim to reflect the equality among members of the network working together at all levels to curb the outbreak.

SEJAJAR provides a vehicle for collective engagement with government, a periodic webinar series to discuss critical issues and regular training opportunities for members, on subjects such as NGO business continuity and coping with financial crises in the face of Covid-19. In recent weeks, it has secured participation in the government-led National and Provincial Task Forces. Civil society groups have also been able to engage policy debates with ministers and senior officials on Covid-19 issues. SEJAJAR provides support for other networks, both within ASEAN and across the Asia-Pacific region.

Working in collaboration with OXFAM and the Muhammadiyah Disaster Management Centre, the initiative has from the outset intended to achieve a post-Covid Indonesia that has a strong civil society in equal partnership with government.

In a number of ways, the network provides a powerful example of progress in country-led reform:

Extending the nexus: bringing together representatives from development, peacebuilding and humanitarian bodies to discuss how to improve response in Indonesia;

Local organisations can source, negotiate and acquire products and services from international actors in humanitarian clusters as suppliers Area-based coordination: locally led coordination at the provincial level ensures that structures, responses and discussion reflect local priorities, are contextually appropriate and leverage the best-placed resources.

Although still in its infancy, SEJAJAR presents an opportunity for learning about local leadership at multiple levels, and how to improve collaboration between people within and outside the traditional humanitarian system.

It also raises issues to explore further: How has the mechanism shifted power dynamics between stakeholders in Indonesia? What lessons can the provincial model be applied to global thinking around area-based coordination?

Understanding this initiative will equip stakeholders in Indonesia and elsewhere to improve a humanitarian system that is now, more than ever, in need of rapid and fundamental change.","Mon, 01 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/GettyImages-1048785348%20copy.jpg,"['going', 'covid', 'local', 'national', 'international', 'lessons', 'improve', 'humanitarian', 'response', 'indonesia', 'actors', 'covid19', 'coordination']",

Women's groups and social media users slammed the apparent joke by security minister Mohammad Mahfud MD, who made the comments during an online address to a local university earlier this week.

Indonesian Chief Security Minister Mohammad Mahfud MD gestures as he talks during an interview at his office in Jakarta, Indonesia, December 26, 2019. (Reuters)

An Indonesian minister is under fire after he compared coronavirus to rebellious wives, in remarks aimed at soothing public fears about easing Covid-19 restrictions across the Southeast Asian archipelago.

Women's groups and social media users slammed the apparent joke by security minister Mohammad Mahfud MD, who made the comments during an online address to a local university earlier this week.

""Are we going to be holed up forever? We can adjust to the situation while still paying attention to our health,"" the minister said on Tuesday.

""The other day I got a meme from my colleague... that says: Corona is like your wife. Initially you tried to control it, then you realise that you can't. Then you learn to live with it.""

Critics panned the remarks as sexist and said it underscored Jakarta's weak response to the virus outbreak.

""This statement not only reflects the superficial power of the government to solve the Covid-19 pandemic problem, but also shows the sexist and misogynistic mindset of public officials,"" Women's Solidarity group chief executive Dinda Nisa Yura said in a statement.

Mahfud's office did not respond to a request for comment Friday.

Indonesia is deploying some 340,000 troops to clamp down on rampant social distancing violations as coronavirus infections surge in the world's fourth-most populous country.

The move comes as the government eyes a reopening of shuttered businesses next week, fearing a collapse in Southeast Asia's biggest economy.

Indonesia has confirmed around 24,000 cases of Covid-19 and 1,496 deaths, but the country of more than 260 million has some of the lowest testing rates in the world.

Researchers estimate the true number of virus fatalities is several times the official toll.

12,12,FF-2020-000140-IDN,3 things you need to know about adaptation and resilience - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/3-things-you-need-know-about-adaptation-and-resilience,"One of the most powerful cyclones to hit the coast of Africa devastated the city of Beira, Mozambique, in March 2019. Cyclone Idai brought damaging winds, torrential rain, and claimed hundreds of lives. Flooding would have been even more severe but for recent improvements in a stormwater drainage system under a project to build resilience to climate change.

Around the world, communities are adapting to the increasingly severe impacts of climate change.

The World Bank is helping countries adapt and increase their capacity to weather climate shocks, with projects supporting early warning systems, disaster response, civic awareness, strengthening buildings, and post-disaster recovery. That effort is even more critical as countries face the health and economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.

Here are three key things to know about the World Bank Group‚Äôs efforts on adaptation and resilience.

1. Adaptation and resilience are inextricably linked to development outcomes.

Good adaptation can deliver good development outcomes, such as safer, better-off communities or hardier crops. At the same time, securing good development requires effective adaptation measures. Investing in adaptation and resilience is not about investing in roads or bridges or powerplants alone. It is about investing in people, businesses, and communities facing the impacts of a changing climate. It is about smarter development that can deliver health, education and livelihoods.

In Kampala, for instance, even just moderate floods block enough streets to make it impossible for over a third of people to reach a hospital during a medical emergency. Disruptions caused by natural hazards, as well as poor maintenance and mismanagement of infrastructure, cost households and firms at least $390 billion a year in low- and middle-income countries. These impacts range from businesses unable to keep factories running or process payments, to people unable to go to work, send children to school, or get to a hospital.

Investments to improve the resilience of infrastructure and boost adaptation are both sound and profitable: the overall net benefits of investing in resilient infrastructure in developing countries could amount to $4.2 trillion over the lifetime of new infrastructure ‚Äì a $4 benefit for each dollar invested in resilience. In Indonesia, a two-decade-old program supported by the World Bank and the Global Environment Facility has restored and improved the management of coral reefs. Today, coral reefs deliver over $3.1 billion in value annually to Indonesia through tourism alone, not including their natural protection against coastal erosion and flooding. Indonesia has seen 17 percent growth in coral reef cover in six out of seven districts, the return of rare species, a 20 percent increase in the incomes of local people, and growing awareness of the importance of ocean health.

2. The Bank Group is ramping up support for countries‚Äô efforts to adapt and build resilience to a changing climate.

The World Bank Group launched a first-of-its-kind Action Plan on Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience. The Action Plan commits to doubling adaptation financing, ensuring that the Bank‚Äôs adaptation financing will equal its financing for mitigation ‚Äì reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to boosting direct finance, the plan will also support countries‚Äô efforts to systematically manage climate risks at every phase of policy planning, investment design, and implementation.

Through the Action Plan, the Bank Group will help client countries on several fronts, for instance, on:

Disaster risk management, through higher quality forecasts, early warning systems, and climate information services to better prepare 250 million people in at least 30 countries for climate risks

Water security, through climate-informed management plans for 100 river basins, and improved flood and drought risk management infrastructure for at least 15 million people

Coastal resilience, by helping at least 20 countries become more resilient to climate-related shocks and stressors

Human development, by helping at least 20 countries adopt more climate-responsive social protection systems

Financial protection, by improving the ability of at least 20 countries to respond early to, and recover faster from, climate and disaster shocks

Forests, by avoiding deforestation, promoting reforestation or sustainable forest management for 120 million hectares of forest in 50 countries.

3. The Bank Group is leading on innovative approaches that will boost adaptation and resilience outcomes in countries.

The Bank Group is actively exploring how to go beyond measuring whether a single investment is resilient, to also evaluating whether our investments build wider, more systemic resilience. The Group is developing a new rating system to create incentives for, and improve the tracking of, global progress on adaptation and resilience. The new system will be rolled out to projects in relevant sectors in our Fiscal Year 2021 (July 2020- June 2021). The rating system will help countries identify which activities most effectively build resilience to climate change and should be prioritized.

Having a clear and simple metric will also enable more private sector investment for adaptation and resilience. Through IFC, we are analyzing climate risk and adaptation options for projects in different sectors and regions. For example, a study of the Khimti 1 run-of-the-river hydroelectric power development in Nepal analyzes how variability in climate conditions, along with future climate change, could affect the plant‚Äôs operations and have impacts for local communities, and recommends options for reducing risk.

It is about smarter development that can deliver health, education and livelihoods.""","Mon, 01 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/report-images/A%20stormwater%20drainage%20system%20helped%20build%20resilience%20in%20Beira%2C%20Mozambique..jpg?itok=4ju2DTFB,"['impacts', 'need', 'know', 'bank', 'resilience', 'group', 'development', 'things', 'investing', 'adaptation', 'world', 'climate', 'countries']", 
13,13,FF-2020-000140-IDN,Letting rivers run wild could reduce UK flooding ‚Äì new research - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/letting-rivers-run-wild-could-reduce-uk-flooding-new-research-138037,"The UK government currently spends ¬£2.6 billion on flood defences in England, and that amount is set to double by 2026. Flooding in February 2020 showed how that‚Äôs likely to be a good investment, as climate change drives warmer and wetter weather each winter. But when it comes to managing rivers to prevent flooding in towns and cities downstream, we‚Äôre often our own worst enemy.

After the second world war, Britain embarked on a mission to reconstruct its rivers. Workers cut ditches to drain moorland, making it suitable for livestock farming. Looping rivers which once wound lazily through floodplains ‚Äì flooding these areas once every two years or so ‚Äì were straightened into rigid channels. River beds were dredged to deepen them and banks excavated to make them steeper, an unnatural situation that takes routine management to maintain.

The idea behind all of this was to reduce flooding by increasing the speed at which water moves downstream. But this also increased the power of rivers to move sediment. Gravels and cobbles dash along these modified and heavily managed rivers, accumulating where the water slows down, as it moves through towns and cities. Here, the river bed swells as sediment piles up, increasing local flood risk.

Environment Agency geomatics group , Author provided

Over 60% of the UK‚Äôs watercourses have been transformed in this way, changing the fundamental character of many British rivers ‚Äì and the natural processes that would usually govern them ‚Äì over just a few generations. In a new study, we found that doing nothing is often a better course of action for reducing flooding than these heavy handed attempts to mechanically alter rivers.

Read more: Changes to our rivers and floodplains have exacerbated flooding

Going with the flow

We studied the River Caldew in Cumbria, which has caused three major floods in nearby Carlisle since 2010. Satellite data showed that straightening, deepening and embanking was common along the river between 2005 and 2016. Very little sediment was spotted in the river and across the floodplain, suggesting that almost all of it was being funnelled downstream towards Carlisle.

During this time, the channel through the city was widened in the hope that this would cause flood water to spread out and lose energy. But this only increased the problem of sediment building up within the river, creating a shallower channel through Carlisle that‚Äôs prone to overflowing.

Google Earth , Author provided

Outside of the city, in parts where maintenance has been relaxed, the river has begun to return to a more natural state. Multiple ‚Äúwandering‚Äù channels can now be seen alongside wide areas of deposited gravel. This is encouraging, as it suggests that the main river and its floodplain are reconnecting, allowing the sediment it transports to fall out of the channel and collect upstream.

We found that rivers which are allowed to behave more naturally are better at locking up sediment upstream, rather than letting it accumulate in unnaturally high quantities in flood-prone towns and cities. If more rivers are allowed to behave naturally and develop this way, it could help reduce future flooding.

Google Earth , Author provided

This hands-off approach to managing rivers is also much cheaper than hard engineering and brings a wealth of environmental benefits with it. The wandering channel system that‚Äôs evolving on the River Caldew has the greatest variety of features and habitats across the entire watercourse.

There are gravel bars, deep pools, floodplain wetlands, ponds and river cliffs. This diversity provides greater spawning habitat for fish, and cooler refuges for their fry. The open water habitats benefit amphibians, the trees and shrubs help kingfisher hunt and sand martins can nest in the river cliffs. Beetles and spiders scurry in the shingle, earning this wilder stretch of the Caldew a designation as a site of special scientific interest.

The last 75 years have seen many UK rivers change beyond recognition. The way we manage them in future must look very different. Relaxing our iron grip and allowing natural processes to flourish on rivers once more could be our best hope for reducing flooding, while reviving lost ecosystems rich in native wildlife.","Tue, 02 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/338274/original/file-20200528-51471-2mp3hx.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C1057%2C7360%2C3680&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['research', 'letting', 'thats', 'flooding', 'towns', 'water', 'wild', 'sediment', 'channel', 'river', 'reduce', 'run', 'natural', 'uk', 'rivers', 'way']", 
14,14,FF-2020-000140-IDN,Tropical Storm Amanda severely impacts food security of 340000 Salvadorans - El Salvador - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/el-salvador/tropical-storm-amanda-severely-impacts-food-security-340000-salvadorans,"SAN SALVADOR - Damage caused by Tropical Storm Amanda which lashed El Salvador is compounding the socioeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and is set to increase the number of food insecure people in El Salvador, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) warned today.

""This is a dramatic situation for thousands of people who have lost their livelihoods. I call on the international community to support the efforts of the government and the United Nations to urgently reduce the suffering of thousands of Salvadorans,"" said Miguel Barreto, WFP's Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean. ""It is crucial to support governments that are facing extreme weather events amidst an ongoing pandemic.""

The results of a WFP rapid food security assessment in El Salvador conducted after the storm that hit the country on 31 May, estimate that 336,300 people in urban and rural areas could be pushed into severe food insecurity, meaning that they may not have the means or resources to feed themselves. On 6 June, WFP and the City of San Salvador began distributing food to 5,500 people in 73 shelters located in the departments of San Salvador, Sonsonate and La Libertad.

Following the storm‚Äôs passage, WFP needs US$8 million to provide urgent food assistance for two months to 153,500 people in severe food insecurity. This request for funds is in addition to the US$19 million required to support the Government of El Salvador in its response to COVID-19.

""These are the worst rains I've seen since Hurricane Mitch in 1998,"" said WFP‚Äôs Representative in El Salvador, Andrew Stanhope, who added that ""the impact of Tropical Storm Amanda and the pandemic has worsened the food security of the poorest families. Now more than ever we must redouble our efforts to urgently reach those most in need with food assistance.""

The west and centre of the country are the main areas affected by the storm, the first in this hurricane season. Authorities have reported heavy flooding, with between 500 to 800 mm of rain accumulated in some departments, and severe damage to infrastructure. The government of El Salvador has declared a state of emergency.

WFP is also supporting the Government of El Salvador in its response to COVID-19. Starting in April, WFP provided food or cash to 32,000 vulnerable people.

No increase in forestry budgets of states due to ecological fiscal transfers, says study

Though Indian states budgeted 19 percent more money for forestry in three years after the introduction of ecological fiscal transfers, the share of the states‚Äô budgets allocated for forestry was 16 percent less than before, finds a study.

Kashmir‚Äôs retreating glaciers could also be influenced by local land use change

The change in the climate system over Kashmir is driven by global factors and larger atmospheric circulations while the local climate, driven by the local land use changes, also has some influence.

Best known as a vast, cold tundra, Russia's sprawling Siberia region is being transformed by climate change that has brought with it warmer temperatures, forest fires and growing swarms of hungry moth larvae.

Spanning millions of square kilometres east of the Urals to the Pacific Ocean, the area has been particularly hard hit this year by extreme weather, which scientists say is the result of global warming.

Photographs of wild flower fields in local media last month were a rare site so early in the year in the normally chilly region‚Äîand ice cream sales were up 30 percent.

""This winter was the hottest in Siberia since records began 130 years ago,"" said Marina Makarova, the chief meteorologist at Russia's Rosgidromet weather service.

""Average temperatures were up to six degrees centigrade higher than the seasonal norms.""

Then spring came, and with it much warmer temperatures. Makarova says April saw some days reach 30 C or higher.

The warmer temperatures didn't just bring wild flowers and boosted ice cream sales.

Rainfall was up by a third in eastern Siberia, sparking devastating floods that forced thousands to be evacuated, particularly in the town of Tulun and the surrounding area.

'Huge moths'

Swarms of the Siberian silk moth, whose larvae eat away at conifer trees in the region's forests, have grown rapidly amid the rising temperatures.

The moths are usually inactive during winter and eat in spring, summer and autumn periods which are now lengthening.

""In all my long career as a specialist, I've never seen moths so huge and growing so quickly,"" said Vladimir Soldatov, a moth expert, who warns of ""tragic consequences"" for forests.

The larvae, which are taking over larger areas of forest, strip trees of their needles and make them more susceptible to forest fires.

Siberia evokes images of chilly winters, but soaring temperatures this spring saw wild flowers bloom and ice cream sales soar

The moth ""has moved 150 kilometres north compared to its usual territory and that's because of global warming,"" Soldatov told AFP.

In the Krasnoyarsk region of eastern Siberia, more than 120,000 trees have had to be treated to kill the larvae, according to the regional forest protection centre.

Another insect pest, the bark beetle that bores into tree trunks, has also recently colonised the region. It has flourished since 2003 as the climate became milder.

With snow melting earlier in the year in northern Siberia, exposed dry vegetation and soil means fires can spread easily, said Alexei Yaroshenko, who heads the forest section at Greenpeace Russia.

From January to mid-May, fires devastated 4.8 million hectares in Siberia, among them 1.1 million hectares of high-latitude boreal forest, according a Greenpeace report published Tuesday.

This year's fires follow on from exceptionally severe blazes last summer.

Forest fires 'doubled'

Climate change has led the number of forest fires to ""double in 10 years,"" said Vyacheslav Kharuk, the head of the forest monitoring laboratory at the Forest Institute in the city of Krasnoyarsk.

The fires risk cutting the capacity of far-northern boreal forests to retain carbon dioxide and methane, which will lead to higher emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.

According to research by Kharuk's laboratory, between 2000 and 2009, around three million hectares of forest caught fire every year. Between 2010 and 2019, the average was six million hectares.

In years to come ""the area of the fires will increase to double or four times the size,"" he predicted.

The news is not all bad: the changing nature of Siberia's landscape will attract new species of birds and animals, Kharuk added.

""Our steppes are getting greener. Our lakes are warming up. Siberia is becoming a more appealing region for animals and for us, too.""

But, he says, the number of extreme weather events means he is already starting to ""miss our winters with temperatures of minus 40 degrees centigrade"".

Indonesia will step up coronavirus testing and isolation of suspected patients in East Java, home to the nation‚Äôs second-largest city and a major industrial hub that‚Äôs emerged as a new virus hot spot.

President Joko Widodo ordered troops and police to assist local authorities in bolstering efforts to contain a spike in cases in East Java, a province with a population of almost 40 million. Jokowi, as the president is known, also called on ministers to focus on flattening the virus curve in other regions reporting high rates of new infections.

A ramp up in testing of samples, aggressive tracking of contacts and strict isolation of people under surveillance is needed to combat the pandemic, Jokowi told a cabinet meeting in Jakarta Wednesday. A day earlier, the president ordered the deployment of almost 350,000 security personnel to help monitor public transport, shopping malls and tourism sites in cities and regions which have implemented partial lockdowns as officials prepare to reopen Southeast Asia‚Äôs largest economy.

The surge in infections in Surabaya, East Java‚Äôs capital and Indonesia‚Äôs second-largest city, has worried officials and on Wednesday prompted the deployment of two mobile laboratories to speed up testing. Authorities plan to add at least three more such units soon, Indonesia‚Äôs Covid-19 task force chief Doni Monardo said.

New Normal

‚ÄúIn the preparation for the new normal, I want you to check the readiness in regions to control this virus,‚Äù Jokowi told his cabinet. ‚ÄúWe are asking for the help of our troops to suppress the curve so that it does not rise again, and to enable sample testing and aggressive tracking of suspected patients.‚Äù

The number of infections in East Java jumped more than four-fold this month to nearly 4,000, accounting for 17% of the national total, up from 9.4% at the end of April, official data show. PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna, a unit of Philip Morris International Inc, closed two of its factories near Surabaya after dozens of workers were infected with Covid-19, including two who died.

Jokowi also ordered officials to control the return of hundreds of thousands of people to cities after Eid al-Fitr, an annual religious holiday period celebrated by Muslims, saying travelers may potentially trigger a second wave of infections, especially in the Greater Jakarta area. Authorities in Jakarta, the first major city in the country to enforce large-scale social distancing rules, will monitor the scale of new infections and other epidemiological evidences to decide if it should extend its partial lockdown beyond June 4, Governor Anies Baswedan has said.

Covid-19 cases have soared in Indonesia in recent weeks with the total tally reaching 23,165 on Tuesday and deaths topping 1,400 even with almost 100 million people in the country‚Äôs most-populous provinces under partial lockdowns for much of this month.","Wed, 27 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20200527/c1_1925152_700.jpg,"['indonesia', 'surabaya', 'regions', 'ordered', 'virus', 'infections', 'testing', 'spot', 'java', 'orders', 'troops', 'east', 'hot', 'partial']",

Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced earlier this week that some transit passengers would be allowed through the hub from Monday, but did not provide further details. Transit through the airport has been barred since March 25 as part of measures taken to help control the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

Cathay said travelers could transit Hong Kong if their itinerary was on a single booking and the connection time to the next flight was within eight hours.

""In this first phase, transiting to and from destinations in mainland China is not available,"" the airline said on its website.

China's aviation regulator has been flooded with tens of thousands of social media comments criticizing it and the Chinese government for the small number of flight options to bring home people stranded overseas.

The regulator drastically reduced the number of allowed international flights to prevent the potential of importing COVID-19 infections. Many foreign airlines are barred altogether and mainland carriers can fly just one weekly passenger flight on one route to any country, which has sent fares skyrocketing.

That rule does not apply to airlines from Hong Kong, such as Cathay, which are allowed more flights to and from the mainland, but the airline's statement on Saturday indicated it cannot immediately take advantage of the boom in demand.

Cathay has cut capacity by around 97 percent due to a fall in demand and strict quarantine regulations associated with the pandemic.

Rival Asian hub Singapore, which is not allowed nearly as many mainland flights, is gradually allowing some transit traffic to resume from June 2.","Sun, 31 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/05/31/2020_05_31_96505_1590894570._large.jpg,"['allowed', 'regulator', 'cathay', 'hong', 'flights', 'airport', 'excludes', 'flight', 'passengers', 'transit', 'kong', 'airlines', 'mainland']",

Text description provided by the architects. Focal Point- In the middle of lush pine forest. The Lakehouse, which was designed by Lukie Widya with his design firm: LUWIST, applies a modern-contemporary architectural style that blends harmoniously with the natural surroundings. The mass of the main building consists of three floors and is covered with exposed terracotta brick material which becomes the focal point as an interpretation of the furnace: a warm media when the cold air matches the Bogor climate itself. With steel construction, the shape of the building is stretched to create a space experience - united with the existing atmosphere, to create an embracing gesture with the forest.

As the main restaurant in Pesona Alam Resort area, The Lakehouse applies a different concept on each floor. 1st floor, intended for a gathering area that is equipped with a sunken seating area. The 2nd floor is a bar area, while the 3rd floor is surrounded by a glass roof intended for private events because it has a roomy view of the pine forest.

Dramatic Composition in edge of Lake. This pine forest area is a recharged zone, so that it has a Basic Building Coefficient (KDB ‚Äì Government rules for green zone area ) of 5%. Also, the distance between trees is relatively tight, so that the solution LUWIST looks for the footprint area with the distance between tree, that is relatively far to obtain the mass of buildings that are between the trees.

In response to government regulations for infiltration areas, the idea was to design an artificial lake which was originally a basin that always floods when it rains, which is at the lowest elevation. When entering the restaurant area, the lake becomes the main view after people walk through the forest. The atmosphere of the lake becomes more alive because it is equipped with a sunken seating area, which allows visitors to interact more closely with the water element. As a hardscape element, the existence of this lake makes the scale of the building to be friendly with contoured forest topography.

The composition of the placement of The Lakehouse creates a dramatic impression. Through a combination of slick masses clad in exposed terracotta brick and artificial lakes, and integration of the fulfillment of the function of regional needs and architectural response is created, forming an organic gesture of the entire designated area.","Sat, 06 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/5ed8/be28/b357/65e6/b400/013e/large_jpg/00FI_ars_04_FEATURED.jpg?1591262740,"['pine', 'forest', 'lakehouse', 'building', 'project', 'architecture', 'lake', 'restaurant', 'floor', 'luwist', 'area', 'main']",

Scientists have little doubt: the destruction of nature makes humanity increasingly vulnerable to disease outbreaks like the COVID-19 pandemic, which has sickened millions, killed hundreds of thousands, and devastated countless livelihoods worldwide.

It also will impede long-term economic recovery, because more than half of the world‚Äôs GDP depends on nature in some way. Could the COVID-19 crisis be the wake-up call ‚Äì and, indeed, the opportunity ‚Äì we need to change course?

While some politicians have claimed that a pandemic of this scale was unforeseen, many experts believed that it was all but inevitable, given the proliferation of zoonotic diseases (caused by pathogens that jump to humans from other animals). More than 60% of new infectious diseases now originate in animals.

This trend is linked directly to human activities. From intensive farming and deforestation to mining and the exploitation of wild animals, destructive practices that we dismiss as ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù place us in ever-closer contact with animals, creating the ideal conditions for disease spillovers. In this sense, Ebola, HIV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) ‚Äì all of zoonotic origin ‚Äì were warnings the world failed to heed.

But COVID-19 could be different. After all, it has demonstrated more starkly than any of its predecessors just how fundamentally linked human health and prosperity are with the wellbeing of our planet ‚Äì and how vulnerable that leaves us. Claims that protecting the environment would crash economies were not only shortsighted, but also counterproductive. It is environmental destruction that has ground the world economy to a halt.

Moreover, unlike previous recent disease outbreaks, COVID-19 has spurred unprecedented state intervention, with governments worldwide developing and implementing comprehensive recovery strategies. This provides a golden opportunity to entrench environmental protection and restoration in our economic systems.

Two principles should shape recovery strategies. First, stimulus alone is not enough; better environmental regulations, conceived with the active participation of business and investors, are also crucial. Second, public spending should be allocated in ways that support a better balance between the health of societies, economies, and the environment. This means investing in green industries, especially those that move us closer to a circular economy.

Leading economists such as Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and Nicholas Stern have found that green recovery packages would offer much higher rates of return, more short-term jobs, and superior long-term cost savings than traditional fiscal stimulus. For example, building clean-energy infrastructure ‚Äì a particularly labor intensive activity ‚Äì would create twice as many jobs per dollar as fossil-fuel investments.

Other priorities include investment in natural capital, such as large-scale restoration of forest ecosystems. This would yield many valuable benefits, ranging from bolstering biodiversity and mitigating floods to absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. To complement such efforts, banks and other financial entities should be held responsible for lending practices that fuel the nature and climate crises.

Some decision-makers recognize this imperative. The International Monetary Fund has published broad guidance for a green recovery, and IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has called for environmental conditions to be attached to corporate bailouts. The French government is already pursuing such an approach.

Furthermore, the European Union is drawing up a green COVID-19 recovery plan that would complement its European Green Deal, which aims to restore biodiversity and accelerate the shift to a zero-carbon economy. A group of 180 European politicians, companies, trade unions, campaign groups, and think tanks recently released a letter urging EU leaders to adopt green stimulus measures.

But, to achieve a sustainable global recovery, many more governments will have to embrace green-recovery policies. And, so far, many are doing the opposite, directing resources toward environmentally destructive industries and activities.

For example, according to the research involving Stiglitz and Stern, unconditional airline bailouts perform the worst in terms of economic impact, speed, and climate metrics. And yet billions are being channelled toward airlines, often with few strings attached.

In fact, according to a recent Green Stimulus Index report, more than a quarter of the stimulus spending implemented so far in 16 major economies is likely to cause substantial and lasting environmental damage. Some, such as US President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration, have also relaxed existing environmental rules, in order to help major polluters recover.

It is increasingly difficult to justify this approach. Lest we forget, just before the pandemic, countries were experiencing unprecedented wildfires and devastating flooding. As climate change advances, the extreme weather events that produce such disasters will become more frequent and severe.

Politicians and vested interests can try to divert attention from the challenges ahead. But this will not prevent future crises; it certainly won‚Äôt make them wait until the COVID-19 recovery is complete. On the contrary, a return to business as usual could hasten their arrival.

Rather than continue to stumble from one crisis to the next, we must build more resilient systems today. Putting environmental preservation and restoration at the center of the COVID-19 recovery is the perfect place to start.

Authorities have moved some 1,000 people from flooded areas to 35 relief camps as the state continues to witness heavy rain since Cyclone Amphan made landfall on the eastern coast of India May 20, reported ucanews.com.

Assam State Disaster Management Authority said flooding has affected nearly 195,000 people as rain and strong winds created havoc across the state.

The National Weather Forecasting Centre has predicted more rain in the region.

Bishop Thomas Pulloppillil of Bongaigaon told ucanews.com: ‚ÄúWhat we are experiencing now looks like an extension of the impact of Cyclone Amphan. Many people lost their houses in heavy rain and powerful winds. The unseasonal rain and floods have caught people off guard and made their lives miserable, especially as they were all working hard to contain the spread of COVID-19.‚Äù

Archbishop John Moolachira of Guwahati, Assam‚Äôs commercial capital, said the flooding had created a difficult situation.

‚ÄúWe have been working hard to settle migrant workers who have returned from other states‚Äù after they lost jobs because of the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown, he said.

Moolachira said the state government is arranging relief camps and food for people displaced by the floods, maintaining the safety protocols of COVID-19.

‚ÄúWe are totally into helping repatriate migrants and keeping a watch on the surging flood as well,‚Äù he added.

One heavily Catholic area of the Guwahati Archdiocese has been particularly affected.

‚ÄúThe diocese is finding it hard to arrange funds to support the flood victims,‚Äù said Father Maya Martin Muchahary, archdiocesan social work director. Many of its existing funds had been diverted to fight COVID-19, he said.

‚ÄúWe can do a survey (of damage) only after the rain stops,‚Äù he added.

It comes close on the heels of cyclone Amphan that impacted the eastern coastal states in India.

The extreme weather events that have come to Maharashtra and West Bengal and their coastal capital cities, against the backdrop of environmental degradation, are overlapping with COVID-19 which is widespread in these areas.

The two cyclones highlight the urgency for climate adaptation and resilience in India‚Äôs coastal cities.

COVID-19 recovery offers a chance to further climate action by giving due importance to sound environmental responses, plans, and policies.

Impacts of two tropical cyclones, cyclone Nisarga in Maharashtra and Gujarat and cyclone Amphan in West Bengal and Odisha, have reinforced the urgency of climate adaptation and building resilience into urban and environmental planning for coastal megacities.

The two states and their capitals (Maharashtra/Mumbai and West Bengal/Kolkata) are currently grappling with overlapping disasters (extreme weather events and COVID-19), against the backdrop of environmental degradation with choking rivers and wetlands and mangroves that buffer from cyclones shrinking due to urbanisation and expansion. Exposed to rising sea levels and high population density, the low-lying cities are prone to flooding during the monsoon which has set in.

Nisarga made landfall near Alibaug in coastal Maharashtra‚Äôs Raigad district on June 3 as a severe cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 100-110 kmph gusting to 120 mph. Mumbai, India‚Äôs commercial capital, narrowly escaped the cyclone‚Äôs fury. It caused minimal damage to life and property said National Disaster Response Force chief R.N. Pradhan, according to media reports.

Mumbai is India‚Äôs most populous city with 20 million residents. The state currently accounts for one-third of India‚Äôs COVID-19 cases. In addition to the pandemic and cyclone, locust swarms have been sighted in parts of eastern Maharashtra, in what is said to be the largest locust swarm in close to three decades.

On the opposite coast of India, barely a fortnight ago, cyclone Amphan barrelled into coastal West Bengal, Odisha (and neighbouring Bangladesh) fueled by unusually warm waters of the Bay of Bengal. It became one of the strongest cyclones in the recorded history of the north Indian Ocean.

Climate scientist Roxy Mathew Koll, lead author of IPCC Special Report on Oceans and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate said that the impact is more when multiple extremes come together. ‚ÄúWe call them compound events. Some of the heaviest rains occurred during cyclone Amphan. Some parts of Kolkata recorded about 200 mm in 24 hours which is like a month‚Äôs rainfall. That happened not only due to the intensity of the cyclone but also because we have more moisture in the atmosphere due to warmer climatic conditions,‚Äù Koll, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology told Mongabay-India. ‚ÄúThese compound events are increasing and are largely affecting the tropics where you have the vulnerable populations who do not generally have access to early warning systems and the benefit of long-term climate change policies and vision in terms of adaptation and mitigation,‚Äù said Koll.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change‚Äôs Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), by the 2070s, Asian port cities like Mumbai and Kolkata, could be most at risk, in terms of population and assets exposed to coastal flooding. Half to two-thirds of Asia‚Äôs cities with 1 million or more inhabitants are exposed to one or multiple hazards, with floods and cyclones the most important.

The frequency of cyclones is more in the Bay of Bengal than in the Arabian Sea: four tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal while the Arabian Sea experiences one. The total systems of cyclonic storms formed in the Bay of Bengal over an 80 years span (1933 to 2012) exceed those of the Arabian Sea because it is relatively colder than the Bay of Bengal, so fewer systems are formed. ‚ÄúHowever, rapid warming is making it fertile for cyclone formation. This could be one reason for an increase in the number of cyclones in the Arabian Sea,‚Äù said Koll.

Experts have stressed that COVID-19 recovery presents a strategic opportunity to transition to a sustainable world by advancing the climate agenda, considering climate implications in economic recovery programmes and giving due attention to sound environmental responses, plans, and policies.

Protecting natural defenses

Impacting communities, cyclone Amphan also damaged one-third of the mangroves in the Indian Sundarbans, named as a Wetland of International Importance by the Ramsar Convention in 2019.

Sujoy, a school student who lives along the shrinking East Kolkata Wetlands in Kolkata, a periurban ecosystem that is also Ramsar site, said the cyclone also damaged the green cover around the wetlands. Sujoy learned about the ecosystem services provided by EKW, as part of activities in the Disappearing Dialogues project that aims to assist the preservation of existing heritage, culture, and environment of regions that are disintegrating. ‚ÄúA substantial portion of the trees were uprooted which will impact the tranquility that we used to experience,‚Äù Sujoy of Kheadaha Higher Secondary school, told Mongabay-India.

In Mumbai, a 66 square km of mangrove cover cushions the city‚Äôs coastline, but it is under continuous threat from the consequences of rapid urbanisation and population surge, Mongabay-India had earlier reported.

Activists have been fighting for the cause of natural protectors like mangroves and salt pans even as flooding incidents regularly occur in the coastal capital of Maharashtra. Ahead of World Environment Day on June 5, a Mumbai-based NGO drew attention to the disappearing mangroves and wetlands in an online petition addressed to the Prime Minister and Maharashtra‚Äôs chief minister‚Äôs office. The petition also pointed to the World Health Organisation manifesto for a green and healthy recovery from COVID-19 that discusses protection and preserving nature as the source of human health, and building healthy cities.

Climate adaptation expert and IPCC author Anjal Prakash reiterated the findings of the Madhav Chitale committee report following the July 26, 2005 Mumbai/Maharashtra flood during which Mumbai received the highest ever rainfall recorded in one day in any city. The recommended corrective actions, including protecting mangroves, must be followed through by the local authorities, he said.

‚ÄúThe report had highlighted inadequate drainage systems, rapid development, and loss of water bodies that used to act as flood control and discharge of effluents in the Mithi river. They have laid out a roadmap in terms of what you could do,‚Äù said Prakash with the Bharti Institute of Public Policy of the Indian School of Business.

IPPC author Joyashree Roy asserted it is not about lack of money but about the right economic planning towards sustainable development and choices for appropriate policies.

‚ÄúSince 2007 Kolkata was the only state in India that had the privilege of having IPCC dissemination meetings at regular intervals to get first-hand knowledge and reports from IPCC secretariat. But the policymakers did not take it with due seriousness. Amphan was not just another event in the city. It was for communicating urgency,‚Äù IPPC author Joyashree Roy, told Mongabay-India, referring to Amphan‚Äôs impact on Kolkata.

Making physical assets climate resilient

We have to make physical assets climate-resilient, said Roy, Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand. ‚ÄúWe need different sets of building codes for various disaster-prone areas and they need to be implemented for all houses.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat we also need are locally built safe drinking water sources that can be even ground water-based because the need is very less. For agriculture, we need better water efficiency systems so that water demand decreases.‚Äù

Following the 2015 floods in Chennai and Mumbai and the December 2015 Paris Agreement, Kolkata Municipal Corporation, in 2016 became the first city in India to prepare a comprehensive roadmap to move the city towards a low carbon and climate-resilient future, with the UK government‚Äôs support.

A review article that examined the quantification, management and climate change impacts of flood risks in Surat, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata, said the region (Kolkata city) is undergoing land subsidence, and this can be a boosting mechanism for future floods in the region.

Although the population in the region has adapted to flood risks as it is not very severe and long-lasting, adaptation strategies can change in the wake of severe floods induced by climate change scenarios, the review suggests. In an attempt to make the city more resilient to climate, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation is testing a sensor-based flood forecasting and early warning system.

Among the four cities, Mumbai followed by Surat (Gujarat) are most vulnerable in terms of flood risks associated with anthropogenic activities. Another factor which exacerbates flood risk in all these cities is the lack of proper drainage and sewerage system. An assessment of climate change impacts on Mumbai observed that by 2080 the likelihood of floods similar to the 2005 flood is more than double.

The study said that for the four cities, future planning and management of flood risks in these cities should also include economic minorities for the sustainability of city environments. It also underscored the implementation of early warning systems combined with information technology in flood risk management and adaptation strategies.

IIT Kharagpur‚Äôs Saptarshi Ghosh who examines social media in the context of disasters said a lot of useful content is posted over online social media in the aftermath of a disaster that can be used in two ways: to help immediate post-disaster relief operations and to enhance preparedness for future disaster events. ‚ÄúWe can identify vulnerable regions, what resources are usually needed in the aftermath of a disaster in an Indian city, etc.‚Äù

Working with collaborators from IIT Bombay, Ghosh used case-studies of two flood events in Indian cities ‚Äì the 2015 Chennai floods and the 2017 Mumbai floods ‚Äî and showed how content posted on Twitter can be used in the two ways: post-disaster relief and future disaster preparedness.

Community collaborations, education, and climate resilience

Stepping up climate change education is also a key mitigation tool and the UNESCO states education is an essential element of the global response to climate change. India‚Äôs National Policy on Disaster Management calls for disaster education in schools to develop a culture of preparedness and safety, besides implementing school disaster management plans.

But monsoon floods damage and destroy thousands of schools each year in India. In 2017, considered as South Asia‚Äôs (India, Nepal, and Bangladesh) worst flooding in years, at least 18,000 schools were damaged or destroyed. India‚Äôs policy also stresses on discouraging ‚Äúthe need to use the premises of educational institutions for setting up relief camps.‚Äù

However, school buildings do double up as relief camps during disasters and in 2020, they have been converted to quarantine shelters to deal with COVID-19 cases during the lockdown.

Artist and art educationist Nobina Gupta who runs Disappearing Dialogues that engage with school students said the need of the hour is also to support and aid the community towards trajectories of self-resilience.

‚ÄúEven within such adversity (Amphan), we came across multiple examples of local efforts and ingenuity to better the general condition of the area. Regardless of state support and administrative help (which has been very little), people themselves have stepped up to create local solutions using their own practices. They are themselves cleaning the streets, repairing broken houses, sheltering the homeless community members,‚Äù Gupta told Mongabay-India.

‚ÄúRebuilding using traditional practices and knowledge are key strategies, which we also intend to support. For all these activities, social institutions like schools are extremely important ‚Äì we hope our links to the school children and the staff would serve as a valuable entry point to organise the local community in this fight for survival.‚Äù

Covering four countries in the region, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, Grab users can make in-app donations that will help UNICEF purchase lifesaving supplies such as masks, gloves, soap, tents and gowns for healthcare heroes and children returning to schools, which lack basic sanitation.

‚ÄúCOVID-19 is a threat to people everywhere. The virus has not impacted everyone equally. The oldest, the poorest, and the youngest have been the hardest hit by the pandemic. Without additional investment in children and the support of partners like Grab, we risk losing achievements that have seen ever more children survive and thrive. Schools need to reopen safely as the longer children stay out of school, the less likely they are to return,‚Äù said UNICEF‚Äôs Regional Director for East Asia and Pacific, Karin Hulshof.

‚ÄúTogether, we can make sure children and families recover, rebound and reimagine a stronger future. We must stop COVID-19 from becoming a lasting crisis for children‚Äù

Grab users can donate money via the GrabPay e-wallet or donate their Grab Rewards points to support UNICEF‚Äôs efforts to deliver essential supplies where they are needed most.

‚ÄúThe COVID-19 pandemic poses a test for our generation like none we have seen. Our users, driver and delivery-partners, and merchant-partners have all been impacted,‚Äù Huey Tyng Ooi, Head of GrabPay.

‚ÄúBut we are also seeing increasing e-wallet usage due to safety and hygiene concerns around the use of cash. More and more people are going digital, and we are confident that many Grab users will be encouraged to support our vulnerable communities in ways that they can, either via e-wallet donations or their Rewards points.‚Äù

Since early January 2020, UNICEF in the region has been working closely with governments and its partners to stop the spread of COVID-19, keep children at the heart of its response and to mitigate the long-term impact of the pandemic on children. UNICEF has provided public health information to people on how to protect themselves, particularly focusing on children, pregnant and breastfeeding women. UNICEF has provided critical medical supplies, including masks and other personal protective equipment to health workers. UNICEF is also making sure that children and their families have access to safe water and sanitation services, and hygiene supplies.

Partnering with companies like Grab helps UNICEF raise awareness about COVID-19 and its impact on children to the millions of Grab users in the region, and to generate much needed funding. Globally, UNICEF is appealing for US$1.6 billion to support its humanitarian response for children impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In East Asia and Pacific, UNICEF requires over US$137.2 million to fund its response.

This initiative is part of UNICEF‚Äôs #Reimagine global campaign to task the global community to #Reimagine a better world for children post COVID-19.

32,32,FF-2020-000140-IDN,"When dams cause more problems than they solve, removing them can pay off for people and nature - The Conversation US",https://theconversation.com/when-dams-cause-more-problems-than-they-solve-removing-them-can-pay-off-for-people-and-nature-137346,"Across the United States, dams generate hydroelectric power, store water for drinking and irrigation, control flooding and create recreational opportunities such as slack-water boating and waterskiing.

But dams can also threaten public safety, especially if they are old or poorly maintained. On May 21, 2020, residents of Midland, Michigan were hastily evacuated when two aging hydropower dams on the Tittabawassee River failed, flooding the town.

I‚Äôm an ecosystem scientist and have studied the ecology of salmon streams in the Pacific Northwest, where dams and historical over-harvest have drastically reduced wild populations of these iconic fish. Now I‚Äôm monitoring how river herring are responding to the removal of two derelict dams on the Shawsheen River in Andover, Massachusetts.

There‚Äôs growing support across the U.S. for removing old and degraded dams, for both ecological and safety reasons. Every case is unique and requires detailed analysis to assess whether a dam‚Äôs costs outweigh its benefits. But when that case can be made, dam removals can produce exciting results.

Pros and cons of dams

It‚Äôs relatively easy to quantify the benefits that dams provide. They can be measured in kilowatt-hours of electricity generation, or acre-feet of water delivered to farms, or the value of property that the dams shield from floods.

Some dam costs also are obvious, such as construction, operation and maintenance. They also include the value of flooded land behind the dam and payments to relocate people from those areas. Sometimes dam owners are required to build and operate fish hatcheries to compensate when local species will lose habitat.

Other costs aren‚Äôt borne by dam owners or operators, and some have not historically been recognized. As a result, many were not factored into past decisions to dam free-flowing rivers.

Research shows that dams impede transport of sediment to the oceans, which worsens coastal erosion. They also release methane, a potent greenhouse gas, as drowned vegetation beneath dam reservoirs decomposes.

One of dams‚Äô greatest costs has been massive reductions in numbers and diversity of migratory fish that move up and down rivers, or between rivers and the ocean. Dams have driven some populations to extinction, such as the iconic Baiji, or Yangtze River dolphin, and the once economically important Atlantic salmon on most of the U.S. east coast.

Old dams under stress

As dams age, maintenance costs rise. The average age of U.S. dams is 56 years, and seven in 10 will be over 50 by 2025. The American Society of Civil Engineers classifies 14% of the nation‚Äôs 15,500 high hazard potential dams ‚Äì those whose failure would cause loss of human life and significant property destruction ‚Äì as deficient in their maintenance status, requiring a total investment of US$45 billion to repair.

Like the failed Michigan dams, which were built in 1924, older dams may pose growing risks. Downstream communities can grow beyond thresholds that determined the dams‚Äô original safety standards. And climate change is increasing the size and frequency of floods in many parts of the U.S.

These factors converged in 2017, when intense rainfall stressed the Oroville Dam in Northern California, the nation‚Äôs tallest dam. Although the main dam held, two of its emergency spillways ‚Äì structures designed to release excess water ‚Äì failed, triggering evacuations of nearly 200,000 people.

Benefits from free-flowing rivers

As dam owners and regulators increasingly recognize the downsides of dams and deferred maintenance costs mount, some communities have opted to dismantle dams with greater costs than benefits.

The first such project in the U.S. was the Edwards Dam on the Kennebec River in Augusta, Maine. In the mid-1990s when the dam was up for relicensing, opponents provided evidence that building a fish ladder ‚Äì a step required by law to help migratory fish get past the dam ‚Äì exceeded the value of the electricity that the dam produced. Federal regulators denied the license and ordered the dam removed.

Since then, the river‚Äôs river herring population has grown from less than 100,000 fish to more than 5,000,000, and the fish have drawn ospreys and bald eagles to the river. This project‚Äôs success catalyzed support for removing more than 1,000 other dams.

I‚Äôve been studying one such project ‚Äì removal of the derelict Balmoral and Marland Place dams on the Shawsheen River in Andover, Massachusetts. The owner of the Marland Place dam, originally built in the 18th century to power a mill, faced a $200,000 bill to restore it to safe condition. The Balmoral, an ornamental dam built in the 1920s, had changed hands so many times that the latest owner ‚Äì a company in another state ‚Äì wasn‚Äôt even aware that it owned a century-old dam in Massachusetts.

The project was a broad team effort. State environmental officials wanted to help restore the river‚Äôs health. Federal regulators supported removing the dams to open up historical habitat to migratory fish such as river herring, American shad and American eels. And Andover leaders wanted to improve recreation on the river.

Dam removals require extensive permitting and a lot of negotiation. For the Shawsheen project, experts from the nonprofit Center for Ecosystem Restoration in Rhode Island guided the many organizations involved through the process.

My role was organizing a volunteer effort to monitor the response of river herring that migrate from the ocean to spawn in freshwater systems. The fish didn‚Äôt disappoint. Although the first spawning season was less than three months after the dams were removed, data collected by local volunteer monitors ‚Äì who number over 300 ‚Äì indicated that the newly opened habitat had hosted approximately 1,500 river herring spawners for the first time in more than 100 years. Since then, numbers have fluctuated, following the pattern on the Merrimack River, into which the Shawsheen flows.

Like salmon, river herring mostly spawn where they hatched. During the previous three years of monitoring, spawners in the Shawsheen were all strays from elsewhere in the system. But this year we expected to see a large number of newly matured adults from our first year of monitoring. Our work is on hold during the COVID-19 pandemic, but we look forward to measuring increased numbers in the spring of 2021.

Still growing

In April 2020, California‚Äôs State Water Resources Control Board approved two key permits for removing four large aging hydropower dams on the Klamath River in California and southern Oregon. This would be the largest dam removal in the U.S.

The board acted based on evidence that dam removal would improve drinking water quality by reducing algal blooms, and would restore habitat for endangered salmon and other organisms that rely on free-flowing rivers. The project still needs approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Assuming it goes forward, I expect that a restored Klamath River will further fuel the movement to remove dams whose costs now clearly outweigh their benefits.

""That will be a challenge because we will need to get more donations to cope,"" Rojas says.

Donations are adequate for now, but they may not last much longer

Obligatory hygiene measures

One of the largest and most modern offshoots of the network is in Puebla, where half of the 6 million inhabitants live in poverty. Its large warehouse is full of hustle and bustle, all under the supervision of Eric Limon. Limon, the head of logistics, keeps a record of what goes in and how much goes out. ""In February we delivered 1,500 food parcels a day; now it's almost 3,000,"" he says.

This was not the only reason the director, Rojas, had long days and short nights: After the pandemic broke out, the food bank also had to establish new hygiene standards in record time.

Now there is a mobile sink with soap in front of the entrance. All visitors have to walk over at least two disinfection carpets and through a tunnel where they are sprayed with disinfectant. Temperatures are measured at the entrance, masks are compulsory for everyone and yellow-and-black crosses on the floor mark the spots where people are to wait to ensure the stipulated distance between them. In addition to gloves and their red work gowns, the volunteers wear aprons that are washed on hot every evening.

Organization is everything

Those receiving aid are encouraged to form groups so that the assistance can be provided collectively. Where this is not possible, deliveries are made or local parishes help out. ""Organizing the recipients has always been an important part of our work to strengthen social cohesion,"" says Rojas.

The food bank in Puebla support some 160,000 people

This has worked well for Angelina Alvarez and Janeth Melchor. The two women come from Patria Nueva, 26 kilometers (16 miles) southeast of Puebla. Two hundred and thirty-three families in their farming village are registered at the food bank. ""We all chip in and rent a van every Friday to pick up the food,"" Alvarez says as she lifts packages onto the load platform. ""Now, with the crisis, there is more need, but there is just not enough room in the delivery van,"" the 58-year-old says.

Donations at risk

The list of donors is long. Supermarkets, wholesale markets and restaurants are at the top of the list. They mainly donate perishable food and food that is close to its expiry date. Donations in kind and money also come from industrial and manufacturing companies, universities or the local football club. But the looming recession is putting a big question mark over the amount of donations in the next few years.

So far, BAMX has mostly focused its attention on the 8% of the people in Puebla who live in extreme poverty. During the pandemic, however, the organization is also trying to stop other families from going the same way, says Rojas. That is because those who live below the poverty line for too long suffer in terms of health and their children fall behind in education. This often turns temporary poverty into a permanent trap.

The Covid-19 epidemic has stopped the world in its tracks and claimed lakhs of lives with no end in sight.

Earlier this year, unprecedented bushfires in Australia destroyed vast amounts of flaura and fauna in addition to killing 33 people.

Indonesia was hit by one of the deadliest floods in recent history.

Second-most active volcano erupted in Philippines, affecting tens of thousands of people.

Then there was an avalanche in Kashmir and earthquakes in North India.

Now, we have locust invasion with hundreds of millions of these insects moving across continents.

Not a normal year by any metric.

During the quarantine, as the world stumbles from one crisis to another, one has been reading the Arthashashtra (science of the government and politics) written by Kautilya, a teacher par excellence who laid the foundation of the Mauryan empire in the third century BCE and installed his student Chandragupta as King.

In Arthashashtra, Kautilya deals with a number of calamities (due to acts of Gods) that can afflict people ‚Äî famines, fire, floods, diseases and epidemics, attack of rats, locusts, insects, etc.

Kautilya instructs that whenever such dangers threaten, ‚Äúthe King shall protect all those afflicted like a father [protects his children] and shall organise continuous [day and night] prayers with oblations.‚Äù [Chapter 4.3.42,43]

As India is under locust invasion presently, here is what Kautilya suggested be done to tackle it.

‚ÄùIn case of danger from rats, locusts, birds or insects, the appropriate animals [e.g. cats, mongoose] shall be let loose and [these predators] protected from being killed or harassed by dogs. Poisoned grain may be strewn around and purificatory rites may be performed by experts. Or, the rat tax [a quota of dead rats to be brought in by each one] may be fixed.‚Äù [Chapters 4.3.21,23-25,27]

To tackle diseases and epidemics, Kautilya suggests to call upon physicians by using medicines, ascetics by purificatory or expiatory rites and experts by occult means if the disease or epidemic is afflicting humans.

In case of diseases or epidemics affecting cattle, he recommends performing ‚Äúpurificatory rites of their sheds and special worship of the appropriate Gods.‚Äù [Chapters 4.3.13-16]

If famine hits the country, Arthashashtra lists various ways to counteract its effects on the population.

This includes ‚Äúdistributing to the public, on concessional terms, seeds and food from the royal stores; undertaking food-for-work programmes such as building forts or irrigation works; sharing out the royal food stocks; commandeering for public distribution private stocks of food; seeking the help of friendly kings; supplementing the harvest with additional cultivation of grain, vegetables, roots and fruits, by fishing and by hunting deer, cattle, birds and wild animals.‚Äù [Chapters 4.3.17-20]

For floods, population living near river banks are required to move to higher ground during rainy season and ‚Äòkeep a collection of wooden planks, bamboo and boats.‚Äò

It‚Äôs a punishable offence in Arthashashtra if the owner of canoes fails to save those in danger.

‚ÄúPersons carried away by floods shall be rescued using gourds, skin bags, tree trunks, canoes, boats and thick ropes,‚Äù it states.

In the Arthashastra, some calamities are rated more dangerous than others.

For instance, Kautilya ‚Äúconsiders floods to be more dangerous because it destroys hundreds of villages while fire destroys [only] one village, or a part of it.‚Äù

While some teachers before Kautilya considered disease and epidemics worse than famine for the former brings all state activities to a halt with people falling ill and dying but work can still continue during famine which makes it possible to collect revenue, Kautilya didn‚Äôt agree with them.

According to him, diseases and epidemics devastates only a region and ‚Äúremedies can be found for the disease. Famine, on the other hand, affects the whole country and deprives the people of their livelihood‚Äú [Chapter 78.4.2-8]

Kautilya‚Äôs reasoning was that effects of diseases are local in nature while floods or famine can devastate agriculture production which in turn can threaten livelihoods throughout the country and have a devastating impact on the state‚Äôs revenues.

We may disagree with this line of thinking today, for we can import food crops easily today to meet local demands in case of famine or floods while an epidemic today isn‚Äôt of local nature and has claimed lives and livelihoods on a global scale.

But during Kautilya‚Äôs time, agriculture was the main source of income not just for the people but also for the state‚Äôs treasury.

That‚Äôs why agriculture produce was taxed while we can afford to keep it tax exempt today.

Apart from ‚Äòacts of Gods‚Äô, Kautilya also deals at length with calamities caused by acts of men which can threaten the state‚Äôs stability.

These include depredations of the armies, decadence of the King/people, internal strife, rebellious guilds/chiefs, dishonest officials/traders, etc.

There is a need to send a strong message to older men that the indecent assault of young boys will not be tolerated.

So said Justice Pamela Beckles yesterday as she dealt with now 51-year-old Trevor Alexander Charles, who was convicted of grabbing the penis of a then 16-year-old Barbados Defence Force cadet as he came out of the washroom of a Bridgetown store.

However, said the judge, the complainant, now 23, had indicated he was interested in compensation and as a result, she ordered Charles to pay the young man $6 000 in six months.

If Charles does not pay it in the stipulated time, the money will attract interest of six per cent per annum. (HLE)

Removing the Marmot Dam on Oregon's Sandy River, 2007 (NOAA)

[By Jon Honea]

Across the United States, dams generate hydroelectric power, store water for drinking and irrigation, control flooding and create recreational opportunities such as slack-water boating and waterskiing. But dams can also threaten public safety, especially if they are old or poorly maintained. On May 21, 2020, residents of Midland, Michigan were hastily evacuated when two aging hydropower dams on the Tittabawassee River failed, flooding the town.

I‚Äôm an ecosystem scientist and have studied the ecology of salmon streams in the Pacific Northwest, where dams and historical over-harvest have drastically reduced wild populations of these iconic fish. Now I‚Äôm monitoring how river herring are responding to the removal of two derelict dams on the Shawsheen River in Andover, Massachusetts.

There‚Äôs growing support across the U.S. for removing old and degraded dams, for both ecological and safety reasons. Every case is unique and requires detailed analysis to assess whether a dam‚Äôs costs outweigh its benefits. But when that case can be made, dam removals can produce exciting results.

Between 1850 and 2016, 63 dam failures with fatalities occurred across the U.S., killing an estimated 3,432 to 3,736 people. National Performance of Dams Program, Stanford University, CC BY-ND

Pros and cons of dams

It‚Äôs relatively easy to quantify the benefits that dams provide. They can be measured in kilowatt-hours of electricity generation, or acre-feet of water delivered to farms, or the value of property that the dams shield from floods.

Some dam costs also are obvious, such as construction, operation and maintenance. They also include the value of flooded land behind the dam and payments to relocate people from those areas. Sometimes dam owners are required to build and operate fish hatcheries to compensate when local species will lose habitat.

Other costs aren‚Äôt borne by dam owners or operators, and some have not historically been recognized. As a result, many were not factored into past decisions to dam free-flowing rivers.

Research shows that dams impede transport of sediment to the oceans, which worsens coastal erosion. They also release methane, a potent greenhouse gas, as drowned vegetation beneath dam reservoirs decomposes.

One of dams‚Äô greatest costs has been massive reductions in numbers and diversity of migratory fish that move up and down rivers, or between rivers and the ocean. Dams have driven some populations to extinction, such as the iconic Baiji, or Yangtze River dolphin, and the once economically important Atlantic salmon on most of the U.S. east coast.

Old dams under stress

As dams age, maintenance costs rise. The average age of U.S. dams is 56 years, and seven in 10 will be over 50 by 2025. The American Society of Civil Engineers classifies 14% of the nation‚Äôs 15,500 high hazard potential dams ‚Äì those whose failure would cause loss of human life and significant property destruction ‚Äì as deficient in their maintenance status, requiring a total investment of US$45 billion to repair.

Like the failed Michigan dams, which were built in 1924, older dams may pose growing risks. Downstream communities can grow beyond thresholds that determined the dams‚Äô original safety standards. And climate change is increasing the size and frequency of floods in many parts of the U.S.

These factors converged in 2017, when intense rainfall stressed the Oroville Dam in Northern California, the nation‚Äôs tallest dam. Although the main dam held, two of its emergency spillways ‚Äì structures designed to release excess water ‚Äì failed, triggering evacuations of nearly 200,000 people.

Benefits from free-flowing rivers

As dam owners and regulators increasingly recognize the downsides of dams and deferred maintenance costs mount, some communities have opted to dismantle dams with greater costs than benefits.

The first such project in the U.S. was the Edwards Dam on the Kennebec River in Augusta, Maine. In the mid-1990s when the dam was up for relicensing, opponents provided evidence that building a fish ladder ‚Äì a step required by law to help migratory fish get past the dam ‚Äì exceeded the value of the electricity that the dam produced. Federal regulators denied the license and ordered the dam removed.

Since then, the river‚Äôs river herring population has grown from less than 100,000 fish to more than 5,000,000, and the fish have drawn ospreys and bald eagles to the river. This project‚Äôs success catalyzed support for removing more than 1,000 other dams.

I‚Äôve been studying one such project ‚Äì removal of the derelict Balmoral and Marland Place dams on the Shawsheen River in Andover, Massachusetts. The owner of the Marland Place dam, originally built in the 18th century to power a mill, faced a $200,000 bill to restore it to safe condition. The Balmoral, an ornamental dam built in the 1920s, had changed hands so many times that the latest owner ‚Äì a company in another state ‚Äì wasn‚Äôt even aware that it owned a century-old dam in Massachusetts.

The project was a broad team effort. State environmental officials wanted to help restore the river‚Äôs health. Federal regulators supported removing the dams to open up historical habitat to migratory fish such as river herring, American shad and American eels. And Andover leaders wanted to improve recreation on the river.

Dam removals require extensive permitting and a lot of negotiation. For the Shawsheen project, experts from the nonprofit Center for Ecosystem Restoration in Rhode Island guided the many organizations involved through the process.

My role was organizing a volunteer effort to monitor the response of river herring that migrate from the ocean to spawn in freshwater systems. The fish didn‚Äôt disappoint. Although the first spawning season was less than three months after the dams were removed, data collected by local volunteer monitors ‚Äì who number over 300 ‚Äì indicated that the newly opened habitat had hosted approximately 1,500 river herring spawners for the first time in more than 100 years. Since then, numbers have fluctuated, following the pattern on the Merrimack River, into which the Shawsheen flows.

Like salmon, river herring mostly spawn where they hatched. During the previous three years of monitoring, spawners in the Shawsheen were all strays from elsewhere in the system. But this year we expected to see a large number of newly matured adults from our first year of monitoring.

Still growing

In April 2020, California‚Äôs State Water Resources Control Board approved two key permits for removing four large aging hydropower dams on the Klamath River in California and southern Oregon. This would be the largest dam removal in the U.S.

The board acted based on evidence that dam removal would improve drinking water quality by reducing algal blooms, and would restore habitat for endangered salmon and other organisms that rely on free-flowing rivers. The project still needs approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Assuming it goes forward, I expect that a restored Klamath River will further fuel the movement to remove dams whose costs now clearly outweigh their benefits.

On Tuesday, social media feeds were flooded with black squares posted by corporations, celebrities, sports stars and the general public ‚Äì along with the hashtag #BlackOutTuesday. It was reported that the idea was to fill Facebook, Twitter and Instagram with blackout squares, halting other activities on social media to free up the time usually dedicated to these platforms for people to educate themselves on the Black Lives Matter movement. Millions of people from different parts of the world participated in the campaign.

Demonstrations had broken out across the United States (US) following the death of George Floyd ‚Äì an African-American who died after being arrested by local police outside a shop in the state of Minnesota. Footage of the arrest went viral and showcased a white policeman, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Floyd‚Äôs neck while he was pinned to the ground.

Floyd could be heard repeatedly saying, ""I can't breathe,"" pleading for his life and begging ""please, please, please"".

Demonstrations over the callous killing of George Floyd have now gone global. Thousands around the world, from London in the United Kingdom (UK) to Auckland in New Zealand ‚Äì are protesting against police brutality in solidarity with US demonstrators.

The Black Lives Matter movement which campaigns against violence and systemic racism towards black people ‚Äì began with the use of the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media back in 2013. This followed the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teen Trayvon Martin in 2012.

The movement has returned to national headlines in the wake of the George Floyd protests.

The #BlackLivesMatter hashtag can also be widely seen on Southeast Asian social media where thousands of people from the region are showing support for black communities in the US. Nevertheless, there have also been responses from some who believe that the matter does not concern them.

Although the extent of violence against black people in the US is incredibly different than what is experienced in ASEAN, one must admit that colourism, anti-blackness, discrimination, racism and xenophobia are still major problems in the region.

Asians have long associated beauty and wealth with fair-skin. A walk in the beauty isle of any shopping mall in the region would reveal a display of a variety of products that focus on skin whitening and brightening. A media report stated that some people in the region ‚Äútake rigorous precautions to protect their skin from the sun, preferring a light complexion that has historically indicated that one doesn‚Äôt labour outdoors.‚Äù Some women in the Philippines and Malaysia among others have even resorted to harmful options to achieve fair skin, including skin bleaching.

According to market research publisher, Global Industry Analysts, the global skin-whitening market was valued at US$4.8 billion in 2017 and is projected to hit US$8.9 billion by 2027 with Asian countries serving as major contributors. This glorifying of a light complexion could result in further demonisation of darker-skinned people.

That is just the tip of the iceberg.

Intolerant Southeast Asia

In 2019, a Nigerian PhD student, Thomas Orhions Ewansiha died while in police custody at an Immigration Depot in Malaysia. It was reported that he had a seizure in his sleep. The student attempted to flee during a raid conducted by enforcement officers. However, he managed to produce a valid passport and student pass upon checking.

""The action of the subject in trying to escape created doubts on the validity of the student pass held by the subject,"" said Immigration Department of Malaysia director-general Khairul Dzaimee. Ewansiha was suspected of committing an offense under the Immigration Act and was held for 14 days for further investigations.

In recent years, the African population in Malaysia has been actively growing, in the form of expatriates and students. Nevertheless, locals often perceive them as being ‚Äòillegals‚Äô, sometimes even ‚Äòcriminals‚Äô and display negative reactions to Africans in general due to prejudice.

Nevertheless, the death of Ewansiha is not the first death under police custody in Malaysia.

According to human rights group Suara Rakyat Malaysia (SUARAM), the majority of deaths in police custody reported in the media are ethnic-Indians. A local media report revealed that there were 257 deaths in police custody between 2002 and 2016, based on statistics provided by Malaysia‚Äôs Home Ministry. Nevertheless, it is said that there is a possibility of massive underreporting of deaths in police custody in the media.

Over in Myanmar, racism has existed for years ‚Äì and can be traced back to the 1930s when anti-Indian sentiments began to rise in the country. According to media reports, between the year 1930 and 1962, thousands of Indian-origin Burmese had to flee to India. This flight of a minority from then Burma, can now be seen happening yet again with the Rohingya of Myanmar. Branded as ‚Äúthe most prosecuted group in Asia‚Äù, the community faces alleged repeated violence in the country. Many have journeyed to Bangladesh, India and Malaysia to save their lives.

‚ÄúFor decades, Rohingya in Rakhine State (on the western coast of Myanmar) have faced discrimination and racially-based restrictions in law, policy and practice. This has intensified since 2012, following waves of violence between Muslims and Buddhists, often supported by security forces,‚Äù noted Amnesty International in a statement.

ASEAN member state Indonesia is also guilty of racial discrimination. It was reported that in 2019, Indonesia saw a series of protests by Papuans in the archipelagic nation in response to the arrests of Papuan students for alleged disrespect of the national flag. In several locations, the protests turned into violent riots, which resulted in the destruction of buildings and even death. Media reports stated that the riots broke out following allegations of racist abuse and mistreatment of Papuan students.

‚ÄúThe racism experienced by many Papuans in Indonesia is deeply rooted in culture and history. It can be violent or subtle,‚Äù Jenny Munro, a cultural anthropologist and lecturer at the University of Queensland noted in a publication titled ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs talk more about racism in Indonesia‚Äô.

Of course, discrimination, colourism and xenophobia are not only visible in geopolitical affairs across the region, but can also be seen in regional films and some television commercials. For example, Dunkin‚Äô Donuts ran a ‚Äúbizarre and racist‚Äù advertisement in Thailand which featured a woman in ‚Äúblack-face‚Äù makeup. It was reported that Dunkin‚Äô Donuts chief executive in Thailand defended the campaign but a spokesman from Dunkin‚Äô Brands later apologised for the controversial commercial.

It is unfortunate that even in today‚Äôs world, the colour of our skin is used to define us. However, there are a number of ways that people can take action against colourism:

1) Educate yourself on the Black Lives Matter movement, anti-blackness, privilege and systemic oppression.

2) Speak up against racism and discrimination.

3) Amplify black voices by reading or listening to works produced by people of colour.

4) Donate to funds such as the George Floyd Memorial Fund or sign petitions that could possibly help in making a difference.

The ASEAN Post stands in solidarity with black America‚Äôs struggle for justice and also with all those across the region who are discriminated against on a daily basis just because of the colour of their skin.

In East Africa, heavy rainfall continued in May, benefiting crop development for main season cereals but causing further flooding and desert locust development. In West Africa, conditions are favourable for main season maize across the south of the region and planting of main season cereals started in May in parts of the Sahel under favourable conditions. In North Africa, harvest of winter wheat crops is complete or nearing completion and production prospects are below-average in Morocco and parts of Algeria and Tunisia due to lack of precipitation and above-average temperatures. In the Middle East, harvest is underway for winter wheat crops and conditions are generally favourable except in areas affected by conflict. In Southern Africa, harvest of main season maize is complete and average yields resulted across much of the region due to rainfall improvements following a delayed and below-average start to the season, except in Zimbabwe, southern Mozambique, and southern Madagascar where below-average yields resulted. In Central and South Asia, planting of spring wheat continued in May under favourable conditions and winter wheat harvesting is expected to begin in June under favourable conditions. In northern Southeast Asia, harvest is complete or nearing completion for dry-season rice, and final yields are expected to be poor due to below-average precipitation received throughout the growing season and a shortage of irrigation water. In Central America and the Caribbean, recent rainfall benefitted planting activities for Primera season cereals; however, there are some areas of concern in northern Honduras and Nicaragua where irregular rains have delayed the start of the season.","Thu, 04 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1521585-EarlyWarning_CropMonitor_202006.png?itok=zYOQ1UcC,"['yields', 'winter', 'season', 'wheat', 'monitor', 'belowaverage', 'main', '50', 'harvest', 'warning', 'early', 'favourable', 'world', 'crop', '2020', 'africa', 'conditions']",

In August 2019, Kerala in India faced a second straight summer of extended downpours and flooding. As rains inundated the region, a colleague working for a local government shared smartphone footage of rising waters moving fast enough to carry away cattle and deer.

While these images filled the screen, the colleague's words revealed a more worrying result of the rains: climate change was destroying assets and deepening poverty for many of the region's low-income people and small businesses. The unfortunate truth about Kerala and other parts of Asia is that those who have the least often suffer the most from a warmer climate.

This truth may nonetheless contain the seeds of a solution. Many of the same countries hit hard by climate change have also introduced programs to include the poor and small businesses in the financial system.

In fact, just as financial inclusion has lifted countless people out of poverty, climate risks have led central banks and financial regulators to update inclusion strategies and introduce policy tools to ensure climate stresses do not undermine efforts at alleviating poverty -- something worth recognizing today, World Environment Day.

Until last year, knowledge of how far banks were making the connections between climate change and financial inclusion was fragmented. The desire to get a more complete picture of this phenomenon led to a survey of how central banks and regulators were considering climate change in their financial inclusion strategies and policies, as part of a project led by the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, or AFI.

Interviews with central banks and financial regulators from 19 countries revealed connections being made in both broader strategies and narrower policies.

For the broader strategies, the survey showed that 12 of the 19 countries had connected climate change and financial inclusion in financial sector plans. For example, Fiji has adopted a National Financial Inclusion Strategy 2016-2020 that underlines its role in policies that build resilience to climate change.

For the narrower policies, the survey demonstrated banks were adopting a diversity of approaches to green inclusiveness. The AFI divided those approaches into a four-part framework of provision, promotion, protection and prevention.

1. Provision policies employ interventionist measures such as bank lending quotas or refinancing facilities for green products or recovery and reconstruction efforts.

2. Promotion policies use moral persuasion, capacity building, data collection and information sharing to encourage banks to consider climate risks and extend access to green technologies.

3. Protection policies lower financial risk through insurance programs or social payments to help those recovering from climate or environmental disasters.

4. Prevention policies involve putting in place environmental and social risk management guidelines to better assess the risk of financial activities.

An important finding from the survey was that many of the most active central banks in this area were in Asia. The Bangladesh Bank, for instance, has been focused on these issues for a decade; in fact, in an example of the provision category, six years ago it introduced a 5% target on the yearly disbursements of green finance.

By contrast, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, in an example of the promotion category, used a softer approach with capacity building and training aimed at convincing commercial banks to adjust their lending strategies.

Overall the survey shed light on an impressive range of approaches to linking climate and inclusive policies. At the same time, it suggested enhanced cooperation between banks and environmental agencies may have potential to strengthen these approaches. Greater cooperation could, for instance, lead to more systematic definitions of green finance and more robust criteria for determining which products should be targeted for green lending.

Similarly, enhanced knowledge exchanges between central banks could help these regulators contribute to the climate actions that countries have submitted through their Nationally Determined Contributions to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. These are sets of climate actions countries intend to implement up to 2030.

All these steps could support a broader effort to align climate change and social development strategies. A more integrated approach to climate change and the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goals is drawing interest in many countries and these steps could add much-needed substance.","Fri, 05 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F0%252F5%252F3%252F2%252F26972350-3-eng-GB%252FCropped-1589181862A20200511%2520Kerala%2520flood.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['connect', 'banks', 'central', 'survey', 'green', 'strategies', 'financial', 'inclusion', 'policies', 'change', 'climate', 'countries']", 
43,43,FF-2020-000140-IDN,Advanced cyclone forecasting is leading to early action ‚Äì and it's saving thousands of lives - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/advanced-cyclone-forecasting-is-leading-to-early-action-and-its-saving-thousands-of-lives-139699,"On May 18, a massive tropical cyclone with sustained winds of nearly 150 miles per hour was barrelling across the Bay of Bengal towards the low-lying coasts of East India and Bangladesh. This supercyclonic storm Amphan (from the Thai word meaning ‚Äúsky‚Äù and pronounced ‚Äúum-pun‚Äù) was the biggest in the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 Odisha cyclone, which killed 15,000 people.

A few days earlier, when it was just a plain old storm, Amphan had swept through Sri Lanka, killing several people in heavy rain, floods and winds. It would go on to cause scores of deaths, make thousands homeless, and cause billions of dollars‚Äô worth of damage. Yet it could have been much worse were it not for the latest computer forecasting and the right interventions by the relevant governments and international agencies.

Although the storm weakened slightly before it hit the coastline of West Bengal, it still overcame much of the network of embankments designed to prevent flooding. Coastal defences were rendered completely incapable of holding back the sea, with reports that sea levels were lifted by 2 metres or more on high tides and a massive storm surge. It caused flooding through coastal settlements and several miles inland, washing away bridges and roads.

Anyone who has ever been caught in such a storm will testify to this overwhelming force of nature. Winds travelling at 100mph will pick up huge objects and fling them around like toys. If you‚Äôre hit, you stand as much chance as if you were struck by a speeding train. During Amphan, buildings toppled in Kolkata, horrifically crushing people inside. Others were electrocuted, as shredded power cables turn wet surfaces into electric chairs. Even a week later in the city, water and electricity supplies were not restored, raising risks of disease at a time when pandemics are already on everyone‚Äôs minds.

This part of the world is used to heavy rain, but hit with monsoon-like rainfall in the wrong season, farmers in Bangladesh were caught unaware as floods caused by the sheer weight of rainfall rushed through their fields. The water gouged away productive soil and ruined crops. By way of comparison, had that amount of rain had fallen over the Thames basin, parts of Oxford, Reading and London would have been underwater within hours.

This was a natural disaster by any measure. Yet many people escaped the worst effects of Amphan because of some heroically accurate weather and flood forecasting.

On 12 May, before the low pressure conditions that were the germ of the cyclone had even formed, and a full eight days before landfall, global multi-model weather forecasts, run on supercomputers at weather centres across the world showed with good accuracy that something major was about to happen. Conditions were right for a cyclone to form, pick up energy from the warm ocean, and track towards India and Bangladesh. Three days before landfall, the forecasts had become so clear that the Indian and Bangladeshi state meteorological departments were able to issue clear warnings. Amphan was the first cyclone of the North Indian storm season, and was a good test of how ready we are.

A good forecast is only the starting point, however. A well-conducted action plan is the key to saving lives. This is where the anticipatory response by national governments and humanitarian agencies has been particularly impressive. After the warning from the Indian and Bangladeshi meteorologists, more than 4 million people were evacuated from coastal areas, even as authorities also coped with the pressure of COVID-19. Evacuation centres had reduced capacity and many temporary shelters had to be put in place at short notice; yet the job was done.

There is still lots of work to be done in order to understand what will happen with tropical cyclones as the climate changes. Their formation is based on a complex series of things, including ocean temperatures and currents, and the strength and direction of winds. These are fiendishly complex physical processes, and are all influenced in different ways as the planet heats up. How all these different elements interact determines how strong the winds get, how high the storm surge is, how much rainfall they pick up, where they go, how quickly or slowly they move over land, and where and how fast rain falls out, creating intense deluges.

This is complex science. Other climate change impacts are easier to predict ‚Äì for example, we know that in a warmer world, we are more likely to see dangerous heatwaves. Some studies have suggested that a warmer world will mean we see fewer tropical cyclones in total, but bigger and more damaging events when they do occur, as a warmer ocean and atmosphere can carry more energy for destructive storms to form.

Of course, climate change impacts more than just one type of weather. In this part of Asia, extreme heatwaves are perhaps a less violent, but more deadly phenomenon ‚Äì and summer is on its way. The joint threats of COVID-19 and heatwaves are going to be particularly tricky. Add to that the coming monsoon season, threats of droughts and other extreme weather, and it‚Äôs clear that the earlier people can be warned and take action to protect themselves, the better.","Mon, 01 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/338560/original/file-20200529-96709-1kdezdo.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C356%2C4753%2C2372&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['storm', 'action', 'saving', 'winds', 'advanced', 'forecasting', 'season', 'thousands', 'lives', 'rain', 'warmer', 'tropical', 'weather', 'early', 'cyclone', 'leading', 'amphan', 'world']",

A 100-year-old Indonesian woman has recovered from COVID-19, making her the country‚Äôs oldest survivor of the deadly respiratory illness.

Kamtim, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, was discharged from hospital this week after a month of treatment in her hometown Surabaya, Indonesia‚Äôs second-biggest city, officials said.

An inspiration

East Java Governor Khofifah Indar Parawansa said she hoped Ms. Kamtim‚Äôs story would give a boost to at-risk residents ‚Äî the illness is especially dangerous for older people and those with chronic conditions.

‚ÄúI hope her recovery can motivate elderly people during the pandemic,‚Äù Ms. Parawansa added.

Born in 1920, Ms. Kamtim was taken to hospital last month after showing symptoms and she was later confirmed to have contracted the virus.

Siti Aminah, the woman‚Äôs daughter-in-law, chalked up her recovery to ‚Äúdiscipline and persistence‚Äù.

‚ÄúEvery day I checked her condition with nurses and they always told me that she was very strong and diligent about taking her medicine,‚Äù Ms. Aminah said. ‚ÄúShe was very motivated to get better.‚Äù

It was not clear how the home-bound woman contracted the virus. ‚ÄúShe probably got it when people from the neighbourhood came around to visit since she never goes outside,‚Äù said Ms. Aminah.

Low testing rate

Indonesia has confirmed more than 26,000 cases of COVID-19 and 1,613 deaths.

But the sprawling Southeast Asian archipelago of more than 260 million has among the lowest testing rates in the world.

Six of the deceased were swept away in cars after deceptively strong floods caught them crossing river beds. Two were dished out of a Suzuki car in the Hargeisa area while the four others, all construction technicians building the Da'ar Budhuq bridge and adjacent road, were drowned by the areas stretch of the same river which traversed Hargeisa.

Zakaria Ismail Dahir (right) was one of the two driving the Suzuki.

A woman was, on the same day, electrocuted to death by an electrified, wet lamp post in the capital.

The violent showers hit the capital and its immediate area unexpectedly at about 3:00 p.m. The rain was laced with big globs of ice which, to some, sounded like if roofs were bombarded by a shower of stones.

Many of the weaker buildings suffered the threat in different forms ranging from total collapse in the case of corrugated iron-sheet shacks to leakages and shaken foundations.

The province described the 2013 flood as the worst in its history, but it might not be for long. Research from Environment Canada shows that climate change is behind more extreme rainfalls in Canada and suggests the problem is likely to get worse.

""If we continue with global warming, we will see continued increase in the frequency and severity of extreme precipitation,"" said Megan Kirchmeier-Young, co-author of a paper published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences.

Researchers combined computer models and observed data for the most specific look yet at how climate change affects the kind of damaging rainfalls that turn streets to rivers.

The idea stems from simple physics. Because warm air holds more moisture than cool air, an atmosphere heated by climate change should hold more water and dump larger amounts of it.

Showing that, however, is more complex.

Previous research on extreme rainfall patterns hasn't been able to achieve a finer scale than the average of the entire Western Hemisphere. Now, scientists have been able to focus on regions within the United States and Canada -- what's happening, why, and what's coming down the road.

They began with figures from a variety of locations for the maximum amount of rain falling over a one-day period and over a five-day period.

They did four separate calculations for the probability of those rainfall amounts occurring each year over a 50-year period from 1961 to 2010. Three were based on climate models that incorporated real-world data on increasing greenhouse gas levels, while the fourth was calculated directly from observed figures.

All four calculations showed increasing chances of extreme precipitation. The result from the observed data showed the highest increase, with chances of one-day heavy rainfall increasing by more than five per cent.

Five-day rainfalls showed similar patterns, although a lower increase.

""We're finding (that) extreme precipitation increases in the models that have this human influence (greenhouse gases) agrees well with the increases we're seeing in the observations,"" Kirchmeier-Young said.

Such studies not only help scientists understand the past. Comparing modelled results with real-world measurements increases their ability to look ahead.

""If we have that, we can have more confidence in what the model is telling us what will happen in the future.""

All three models in the study showed the chance of over-the-top rainfalls is expected to increase far into the future.

""If we continue with global warming, we will see continued increase in the frequency and severity of extreme precipitation,"" Kirchmeier-Young said.

The consequences are serious, she added. A one-day deluge can create significant flash floods in an urban area; five-day downpours can swell rivers over their banks -- although river floods are complicated by more factors than just rainfall.

Urban planners, builders and regulators are all going to have to take Canada's coming climate into account.

""We have to be thinking about what impacts more heavy rainfall will have,"" Kirchmeier-Young said. ""Flash flooding is something that we're going to have to be thinking more about and be more concerned with.""

Are we re-living the biblical plague? It‚Äôs a thought that most people have been asking, and discussing on their dining tables. Every few years, we contemplate if this is it. If this is the end.

Nature‚Äôs fury only heightens the curiosity and makes it seem as though it is a sign. And if you look back at the past few months, it kind of reaffirms the worst.

2020 began with a bang, literally! The earth cracked open and Puerto Rico witnessed several quakes with tremors ranging from 4.8 to 6.4. February had villagers in Kenya look up at a dark cloud, hoping to see some respite against their scorching heatwave; only to realise minutes later that it was a severe locust attack. ‚ÄúIt looked as though an umbrella had covered the sky.‚Äù

The ant invasion grappled Oman, leaving its government and environmentalists at a loss as to where they originated from and as the middle east was trying to cope, the Taal volcano erupted in the Philippines leaving flights cancelled and people distraught. Heavy Snowfall and incessant rains in Pakistan‚Äôs Balochistan province broke its 200 year old record and brought the district to a standstill.

In a place where floods are rare, Dubai witnessed heavy rainfall. 3 hours of rainwater accounted for over a month‚Äôs forecast. Speaking of floods, the one in Indonesia was the worst in over a decade and took away many lives and livelihoods, in a snatch. Severe storms swept across America‚Äôs deep south, and then came Corona and brought the world to a standstill. No more were we divided into provinces or regions‚Ä¶ This Wuhan originated pandemic affected each and every part of the world and continues to do so.

And while we are grappling with a microbe we know nothing about, North India is burning with heat, Amphan is raging across West Bengal, locusts are causing havoc‚Ä¶.

What were the biblical plagues again? Hail, Locusts, darkness, livestock, death, boils‚Ä¶ If we include heatwaves as them‚Ä¶ Where are we going? What are we doing?

This is a lesson for Humanity as a whole. It is Nature‚Äôs way of saying that from now on SHE is taking charge and protecting the other side of life‚Ä¶ the trees, animals, plants.. to maintain a balance between us humans and them living beings! Ironical isn‚Äôt it?

While we‚Äôve all been realising just how many moments of history the show appeared to foresee, whether a coincidence or not, now viewers are finding some scenes perfectly riff on our current state.

From season nine, episode 20 episode, The Trouble With Trillions, the characters of the Fox show are gathering to ring in a new year, only to have it scuppered on the final countdown when the dropping ball halts with eight seconds to go.

‚ÄòOh will this horrible year never end?‚Äô Homer cries as punters gather at the town clock.

‚ÄòWe‚Äôve never lost a year before and I‚Äôll be damned if we‚Äôre gonna lose one on my shift,‚Äô Chief Wiggum interrupted, before shooting the ball down to bring in the new year.

One fan unearthed the clip this week to try and illustrate how the world is feeling, having gone through so much this year already ‚Äì and having it only just cross over into June.

‚ÄòOh will this horrible year never end?‚Äô (Picture: Fox)

Sharing the clip to Reddit, they wrote: ‚ÄòOnly halfway there, but very much the feeling across the world.‚Äô

And, sure, they have a point ‚Äì we‚Äôve been going on about 2020 quite a lot, for good reason.

What with the bushfires that ravaged Australia, wiping out a billion animals and thousands of homes, with many lives lost, at the turn of the year, the locust plagues and hurricanes and typhoons that shook nations, with floods in Indonesia. Plus the horrific deaths of 176 when a Ukrainian passenger plane was shot down in Iran.

The celebrity deaths, with that of both the sudden deaths of Kobe Bryant and Caroline Flack shaking their millions of fans to the core before we‚Äôd even hit March.

Australia was ravaged by fires as the year began (Picture: AP)

Oh and don‚Äôt even get us started on coronavirus ‚Äì with more than 380,000 people so far dying from Covid-19 and the majority of the UK locked indoors since March to ‚Äòflatten the curve‚Äô (with no end in sight to when we can go back to what used to be normal).

The death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old father who died after a police office knelt on his neck, has also sent shockwaves around the world, kickstarting protests and educating many on the Black Lives Matter movement.

However, one may argue his horrific death could end up being a catalyst for 2020 to bring about immense positive change in society, so we‚Äôre going to keep our fingers crossed on that one.

Fans of the Reddit post were a little sceptical of the original message ‚Äì we‚Äôre good like that ‚Äì as they responded to the clip.

One mused: ‚ÄòI doubt 2021 will be a significant step up.‚Äô

Hey, you‚Äôve got to have faith, mate.

Another felt the message fell flat as many things we‚Äôve witnessed this year is due to climate change, which isn‚Äôt really a ‚Äò2020 thing‚Äô ‚Äì however they were rebuffed by one user who commented: ‚ÄòCOVID-19 and police brutality have nothing to do with climate change. If anything, COVID-19 benefited the climate for a while.‚Äô

Regardless, we can definitely chalk this up to The Simpsons, yet again, perfectly encapsulating the whole vibe of, well, whatever the heck is happening right now.

The South East Asian archipelago began deploying around 340,000 troops across two dozen cities to oversee enforcement of measures aimed at halting transmission of the disease, such as wearing facemasks in public.

But provincial leaders are buttressing these efforts with their own zealous campaigns to fight the virus.

Police in western Bengkulu province have assembled a 40-person squad to find lockdown scofflaws and force them to wear placards with promises to wear masks and keep their distance from others in future.

Pictures of the perpetrators are then uploaded to social media for maximum shaming effect, according to an official.

‚ÄúPeople in Bengkulu still aren‚Äôt aware of the importance of following the rules, especially when it comes to wearing masks and not gathering‚Äù in big groups, said Martinah, Bengkulu‚Äôs public order agency chief, who goes by one name.

‚ÄúThis is for the sake of themselves and their families,‚Äù he added.

Some of those singled out by police have bristled at the punishment, including fisherman Firmansyah, who was punished for failing to abide by the mask rule while alone on his boat.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs silly to wear a mask when I‚Äôm out at sea,‚Äù he said, after he was nabbed returning to shore.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no regulation to wear a mask in the water. If there was I‚Äôd comply with it.‚Äù

Farther north in Aceh province, people flouting public health regulations have been forced to atone by reading passages from the Qur‚Äôan.

The area‚Äôs tiny non-Muslim minority are spared from the punishment.

‚ÄúIf we find them not wearing face masks they‚Äôll just be reprimanded,‚Äù said local government spokeswoman Agusliayana Devita.

Capital city Jakarta announced new rules this month that could see residents who break social distancing rules forced to clean public facilities - including toilets - while wearing vests that label them as rule-breakers.

To the east in Sragen regency, offenders have been jailed in repurposed abandoned houses that local residents believe are haunted - tapping widespread beliefs in the supernatural, which play a key role in Indonesian folklore.

Indonesia has confirmed around 24,000 cases of Covid-19 and 1,496 deaths, but the country of more than 260mn has some of the lowest testing rates in the world.

MOGADISHU, May 28 2020 (IPS) - While simultaneously suffering from the coronavirus pandemic, flooding and a locust crisis, Somalia, could well see a rise in the number of people who are susceptible to human trafficking.

According to the United Nation‚Äôs Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the rainy season in Gu resulted in twice the average rainfall, causing floods across this East African nation, affecting almost a million people and displacing over 400,000 people.

‚ÄúAs more people find themselves in vulnerable circumstances as a result of displacement from floods, drought and conflict, it is assumed that some of them are likely to seek ‚Äúgreener pastures‚Äù it is anticipated that in this state of vulnerability they could become susceptible to human trafficking and exploitation,‚Äù Isaac Munyae, Programme Manager for Migrant Protection and Assistance at the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) Somalia, told IPS over email.

This Horn of Africa nation is considered a source, transit and destination country for trafficking in the region and each year a unknown number of migrants pass through the country‚Äôs borders. According to Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) officials, trafficking has been rampant in the country for decades.

‚ÄúMany Somalis are trafficked across the borders and are often moving along the southern and northern routes through Sudan, South Sudan and Kenya. On the other hand there are some Somalis and a lot of Ethiopians travelling to Yemen along the eastern route that pass through Somalia and also fall prey to exploitation,‚Äù Munyae said.

The IOM added that the COVID-19 outbreak ‚Äî Somalia has some 1,711 confirmed cases as of May 27 ‚Äî ‚Äúposes an additional challenge in an already fragile context where it may further hinder access to basic services, leaving the population highly vulnerable‚Äù.

‚Ä¢ According to the U.N. Refugee Agency, the country has some 2.6 million displaced people.

‚Ä¢ Since the start of this year, more than 220,000 Somalis were internally displaced because of drought and climate-related disasters, including 137,000 due to conflict.

‚Ä¢ And in March and April, more than 50,000 people were forced to flee their homes as operations against the Islamic insurgent group, Al Shabab, resumed in Lower Shabelle.

With continued political and food insecurity, and the second-longest coastline in Africa after Madagascar (3,333 kilometres) which is difficult to patrol, the U.N.-backed FGS said it is doing its utmost to end human trafficking.

‚ÄúSomalia has a very long coastline and as I am speaking to you, we don‚Äôt have the capacity to control all of it, but our police maritime unit who have close cooperation with other forces in the country are always engaged in routine operations using speed boats, but to fully control such a long coastline needs much capacity than we currently have,‚Äù the head of the Department for the Fight Against Smuggling and Human Trafficking, Abdiwakil Abdullahi Mohamud, told IPS.

Mohamud and Somali parliament member Mohamed Ibrahim Abdi both lamented the lack of an existing human trafficking law.

‚ÄúHuman trafficking is a big problem which must be tackled, but I can confirm that Somali parliament hasn‚Äôt yet a human trafficking law. We recognise the importance of a law, but right now there is nothing on the table, I hope we will get the law in place in the future, I cannot say when,‚Äù Abdi, told IPS.

However, the federal state of Puntland has a human trafficking act in place, which requires enforcement. While in the breakaway region of Somaliland, ‚Äúa referral mechanisms for supporting victims of human trafficking was developed and adopted this year,‚Äù said Munyae.

In December, the FGS and IOM signed a cooperation agreement where ‚ÄúIOM proposes to work with the government in establishment of appropriate legal frameworks and referral mechanisms in collaboration with other UN and I/NGO partners,‚Äù Munyae told IPS.

There are no official figures of trafficking in Somalia.

According to Mixed Migration Centre, in May 2019 there was an increase of 41 percent of the number of people migrating from Somalia to Yemen.

Those migrants were from Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya. The center said that in April 2019 alone some 18,904 Somali and Ethiopian migrants were recorded to have arrived in Yemen.

Mohamud said his department developed a close cooperation with the Department of Immigration and has so far been able to end the trafficking of people through airports and sea ports.

However, he pointed out that it was not possible to control all land borders as they had limited resources available.

According to Mohamud, his department prevented thousands of young Somali men and women from being trafficked out of the country since it was established three years ago. But he is mindful that people previously saved from trafficking could once again become susceptible.

‚ÄúWe do not have the financial capacity to create jobs for them, but we teach them some skills and we then hand them over to their families. That is what we are able to do for them at the moment,‚Äù he said, adding that high unemployment meant young Somalis were vulnerable to human traffickers.

According to a figure released by the International Labour Organisation in 2019, the youth unemployment rate in Somalia was 24.89 percent.

Munyae added that additional factors that resulted in susceptibility to human trafficking included, ‚Äúpoverty as a result of loss in livelihoods caused by displacements for whatever reason, family pressures, social factors such as child marriages and forced labour and customary practices and lack of appropriate legal frameworks for protecting the rights of mobile population‚Äù.

However, Muna Hassan Mohamed, the chairlady of Somali Youth Cluster, believes that many youth are risking their lives in the hands of human traffickers as they are promised dual nationality.

‚ÄúOf course, the unemployment and insecurity are very big problems that we can‚Äôt deny, but the main factor that drives young Somalis to be exploited by human traffickers is what I can call [the passports].

‚ÄúWhen I say passports, I mean European, American, Canadian or Australian passports, because if you are a citizen of any of these countries, then it is easier for you to be an MP, a minister or get a well-paid job in Somalia,‚Äù she told IPS, adding that most Somali parliament members, government ministers, general directors and other key staffers are all dual citizens.

‚ÄúAlmost every well-paid job in Somali government‚Äôs institutions has been taken by Somalis with foreign passports, while international NGO‚Äôs in the country do not have an equal opportunity policy when employing Somali nationals,‚Äù she said explaining that those Somalis with dual citizenship were paid more than locals.

Meanwhile, Omar Ahmed Tahriib-diid, who irregularly migrated to Europe in 2014, wants to spare others the hardships he faced.

Tahriib-diid, who now lives in the relatively peaceful Puntland State northeast of Somalia, said he decided to return to his native region.

‚ÄúEvery day I witnessed people dying of hunger or being tortured to death by the cruel human traffickers. We always hear in the news that migrants drowned at sea, but the underreported thing is that many more die even before reaching the sea,‚Äù Tahriib-diid told IPS of what he experienced when he left the country, travelling through Sudan and Libya.

‚ÄúIn Sudan they dealt with us well, but I can say that there was a widespread brutality in Libya which I can describe as a hell on earth,‚Äù he said.

Eventually, he made his way to Germany where he tried for an entire year and had been unable to get a job. Upon his return to Somalia, he landed a job as the regional coordinator for Sanaag region at the Ministry of Justice in Puntland State.

Now he remains engaged in awareness programmes and ‚Äúsucceeded to prevent many young people from risking their lives. Some of them are now running their own business or secured jobs through my awareness campaigns with the help from the government‚Äù.

The Philippine government yesterday rejected a UN report for what it called ‚Äúfaulty conclusions‚Äù about increasing human rights violations.

The UN Human Rights Office said violations in the Philippines have become more acute as Duterte‚Äôs ‚Äúincendiary‚Äù language encourages the use of violent force in countering national security threats and illegal drugs.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said that while the government notes the recommendations by the UN Human Rights Office, it ‚Äúcannot commit to their full implementation given the faulty conclusions on which they were premised.‚Äù

Roque cited the report‚Äôs premise that drug suspects were being killed without due process or detained arbitrarily, and that Filipinos‚Äôcivic rights were being destroyed by the focus on public order and national security.

‚ÄúWe firmly reject these conclusions,‚Äù he said in a statement. ‚ÄúThat being said, the government will continue to respect its international legal obligations, including human rights.‚Äù

He added that while the government will ensure rights guaranteed by the constitution, it also has the duty to maintain the rule of law and to deal with any offences to protect the majority of Filipinos.

The UN report released on Thursday said that while official figures indicate that at least 8,663 people have been killed since the Philippines launched its campaign against illegal drugs in 2016,some estimates put the real toll at more than triple that number.","Sat, 06 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.gulf-times.com/Content/Upload/Slider/62020623265705021050.jpg,"['report', 'govt', 'killed', 'national', 'human', 'conclusions', 'rising', 'rejects', 'violations', 'philippines', 'illegal', 'faulty', 'rights', 'office']", 
57,57,FF-2020-000140-IDN,Peatland drainage in Southeast Asia adds to climate change - MIT News,https://news.mit.edu/2020/peatland-drainage-southeast-asia-climate-change-0604,"The startling prevalence of such rapid destruction of the peatlands, and their resulting subsidence, is revealed in a new satellite-based study conducted by researchers at MIT and in Singapore and Oregon. The research was published today in the journal Nature Geoscience, in a paper by Alison Hoyt PhD ‚Äô17, a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry; MIT professor of civil and environmental engineering Charles Harvey; and two others.

In less than three decades, most of Southeast Asia‚Äôs peatlands have been wholly or partially deforested, drained, and dried out. This has released carbon that accumulated over thousands of years from dead plant matter, and has led to rampant wildfires that spew air pollution and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Tropical peatlands are permanently flooded forest lands, where the debris of fallen leaves and branches is preserved by the wet environment and continues to accumulate for centuries, rather than continually decomposing as it does in dryland forests. When drained and dried, either to create plantations or to build roads or canals to extract the timber, the peat becomes highly flammable. Even when unburned it rapidly decomposes, releasing its accumulated store of carbon. This loss of stored carbon leads to subsidence, the sinking of the ground surface, in vulnerable coastal areas.

Until now, measuring the progression of this draining and drying process has required arduous treks through dense forests and wet land, and help from local people who know their way through the remote trackless swampland. There, poles are dug into the ground to provide a reference to measure the subsidence of the land over time as the peat desiccates. The process is arduous and time-consuming, and thus limited in the areas it can cover.

Now, Hoyt explains, the team was able to use precise satellite elevation data gathered over a three-year period to get detailed measurements of the degree of subsidence over an area of 2.7 million hectares mostly in Malaysia and Indonesia ‚Äî more than 10 percent of the total area covered by peatlands in the Southeast Asia region. Over 90 percent of the peatland area they studied was subsiding, at an average of almost an inch a year (over 1 foot every 15 years). This subsidence poses a threat to these ecosystems, as most coastal peatlands are at or just above sea level.

‚ÄúPeatlands are really unique and carbon rich environments and wetland ecosystems,‚Äù Hoyt says. While most previous attempts to quantify their destruction have focused on a few locations or types of land use, by using the satellite data, she says this work represents ‚Äúthe first time that we can make measurements across many different types of land uses rather than just plantations, and across millions of hectares.‚Äù This makes it possible to show just how widespread the draining and subsidence of these lands has been.

‚ÄúThirty years ago, or even 20 years ago, this land was covered with pristine rainforest with enormous trees,‚Äù Harvey says, and that was still the case even when he began doing research in the area. ‚ÄúIn 13 years, I've seen almost all of these rainforests just removed. There's almost none at all anymore, in that short period of time.‚Äù

Because peat is composed almost entirely of organic carbon, measuring how much that land has subsided provides a direct measure of the amount of carbon that has been released into the atmosphere. Unlike other kinds of subsidence seen in drier ecosystems, which can result from compaction of soil, in this case the missing depth of peat reflects matter that has actually been decomposed and lost to the air. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just compaction. It‚Äôs actually mass loss. So measuring rates of subsidence is basically equivalent to measuring emissions of carbon dioxide,‚Äù says Harvey, who is also a principal investigator at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), MIT‚Äôs research enterprise in Singapore.

Some analysts had previously thought that the draining of peatland forests to make way for palm oil plantations was the major cause of peatland loss, but the new study shows that subsidence is widespread across peatlands under a diverse set of land uses. This subsidence is driven by the drainage of tropical peatlands, mostly for the expansion of agriculture, as well as from other causes, such as creating canals for floating timber out of the forests, and digging drainage ditches alongside roads, which can drain large surrounding areas. All of these factors, it turns out, have contributed significantly to the extreme loss of peatlands in the region.

One longstanding controversy that this new research could help to address is how long the peatland subsidence continues after the lands are drained. Plantation owners have said that this is temporary and the land quickly stabilizes, while some conservation advocates say the process continues, leaving large regions highly vulnerable to flooding as sea levels rise, since most of these lands are only slightly above sea level. The new data suggest that the rate of subsidence continues over time, though the rate does slow down.

The satellite measurements used for this study were gathered between 2007 and 2011 using a method called Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), which can detect changes in surface elevation with an accuracy of centimeters or even millimeters. Though the satellites that produced these data sets are no longer in operation, newer Japanese satellites are now gathering similar data, and the team hopes to do followup studies using some of the newer data.

‚ÄúThis is definitely a proof of concept on how satellite data can help us understand environmental changes happening across the whole region,‚Äù Hoyt says. That could help in monitoring regional greenhouse gas output, but could also help in implementing and monitoring local regulations on land use. ‚ÄúThis has really exciting management implications, because it could allow us to verify management practices and track hotspots of subsidence,‚Äù she says.

While there has been little interest in the region in curbing peatland drainage in order to curb greenhouse gas emissions, the serious risk of uncontrollable fires in these dried peatlands provides a strong motivation to try to preserve and restore these ecosystems, Harvey says. ‚ÄúThese plumes of smoke that engulf the region are a problem that everyone there recognizes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis new approach ... allows peat subsidence to be easily monitored over very large spatial extents and a diversity of settings that would be impossible using other approaches,‚Äù says David Wardle, the Smithsonian Professor of Forest Ecology at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, who was not associated with this research. ‚ÄúIt is in my opinion an important breakthrough that moves forward our understanding of the serious environmental problems that have emerged from peat forest clearing and its conversion and degradation, and, alarmingly, highlights that the problems are worse than we thought they were.‚Äù

58,58,FF-2020-000140-IDN,"Mongabay, Climate change favours locust swarms, India increasingly at risk - Mongabay-India",https://india.mongabay.com/2020/06/climate-change-favours-locust-swarms-india-increasingly-at-risk/,"The largest locust swarm in close to three decades is eviscerating farmlands in western and northern India, spreading panic among farmers getting ready to sow the country‚Äôs main summer crop.

The warming of the Indian Ocean due to climate change is cited as the main reason for the proliferation of locusts that are now ranging from the horn of Africa to the Arabian Peninsula to the Indian subcontinent.

Since the spring harvest was gathered before the locust plague, there has been no extensive crop damage, but such swarming is more likely in the future, prompting calls for preventive and containment strategies.

Even as India grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, the country has been hit by a new pestilence in the form of large locust swarms. In the biggest attack in close to 30 years, millions of locusts are swarming across western and northern India, destroying farms and raising alarm ahead of the main summer cropping season.

So far, 41 districts spread across five states ‚Äî Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh ‚Äî have reported sightings of the insects, and many more districts could see swarm attacks in the next few weeks. Provincial governments in Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Telangana and Karnataka have sounded alerts.

The central government has issued an unprecedented locust warning to 16 states and has readied a fleet of air force helicopters to spray pesticides to kill the insects. Despite the Covid-19 lockdown, locust control offices are working since April 11 with 50 spray machines in coordination with various district administration and state agriculture department, the federal farm ministry said in a statement.

‚ÄúTractor mounted sprayers and fire-tender vehicles deployed at various locations are being used in locust control,‚Äù the ministry said. India has also ordered 60 new spraying machines from the United Kingdom that are scheduled to arrive soon, according to K.L. Gurjar, deputy director at India‚Äôs Locust Warning Organization (LWO), a unit that functions under the agriculture ministry.

Warning of successive waves

Compared with the locust attacks in the Horn of Africa, the swarms in India are still relatively small and they are most likely to remain so, according to Keith Cressman, senior locust forecasting officer at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. ‚ÄúNevertheless, several successive waves of small swarms are likely to appear throughout the coming months in Rajasthan, some of which could continue to move eastwards ahead of the advancing monsoon,‚Äù he said.

The locust sightings have been much earlier than usual in India, most likely because their population increased significantly in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This could spell trouble for India since the swarms can double back to the Thar Desert that straddles India and Pakistan and spawn the next generation of locusts in much larger numbers that could destroy the main summer crop, experts said.

‚ÄúMuch depends on the effectiveness of control operations and the rains and (summer) growing season this year,‚Äù Cressman said.

Despite panic reactions in some areas, the situation is not yet beyond control. ‚ÄúThe Locust Warning Organization of the Indian government is the oldest national locust program in the world. They are very well prepared with the necessary expertise and equipment for managing the desert locusts,‚Äù Cressman said. ‚ÄúIn January, FAO first alerted officials and met with them to discuss anticipatory actions, which the government has been actively pursuing since then in preparing for the potential arrival of desert locust.‚Äù

Swarms are forming in the spring breeding areas and migrating east to the India-Pakistan border ahead of the monsoon rains, the FAO said in its latest locust update on May 27. ‚ÄúSeveral successive waves of invasions can be expected until July in Rajasthan with eastward surges across northern India as far as Bihar and Orissa, followed by westward movements and a return to Rajasthan on the changing winds associated with the monsoon,‚Äù The FAO bulletin said. ‚ÄúThese movements will cease as swarms begin to breed and become less mobile.‚Äù

The current upsurge was initiated by two cyclones in the western Indian Ocean in 2018, according to Cressman. ‚ÄúWe have noticed an increase in the number of cyclones in the past half dozen years. Cyclones are known to initiate desert locust plagues in the past,‚Äù Cressman said.

Piranhas of the skies

Locusts, a species of short-horned grasshoppers, have often been called piranhas of the skies. A single locust can eat its own body weight in food, which is about 2-2.5 grams. Since they fly in swarms, millions of individual insects operate as a gigantic eating machine that can decimate large areas in a matter of days. A swarm measuring 1 sq. km can eat as much food as 35,000 people in one day, according to FAO‚Äôs Locust Information Service.

Locusts lay eggs in sacks of 50 to 100 each. Locusts eggs are extremely resilient and have been known to lay dormant for a few weeks before hatching in favourable conditions. Once they hatch, the wingless larvae mature into adolescent hoppers in about two weeks, a time period that can be significantly shorter if there‚Äôs moisture in the air.

Once they grow wings, locusts form swarms that can cover 150 km in a single day. Typically, they reach sexual maturity in three months, which means there can be up to four generations every year. Since they can multiply by a factor of 20 to 100 every generations, swarms can number into billions in a matter of months.

There was unprecedented rainfall in eastern African and the Middle East in the summer of 2018. Locust eggs that were dormant in the deserts of these regions suddenly came to life. Initially, this hatching went undetected because it happened deep in the deserts. Soon the hatcheries in the deserts of Oman and the usually dry jungles of Kenya clustered together to form a super swarm.

This swarm decimated vast areas in the Horn of Africa, triggering serious concerns of food security in the countries of the region. Soon, some of these locusts moved eastward on favourable winds to eventually arrive in northwest Pakistan and the Thar Desert. The swarming in Pakistan has led to the government in that country to declare a national emergency.

Locusts thrive in humid conditions, and outbreaks often follow floods and cyclones, according to a report by FAO and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). Heavy rain leads to the growth of vegetation in arid areas, providing locusts with the conditions needed to develop and reproduce, the WMO said in the latest report.

Climate connection

The proliferation of desert locusts is linked with weather dynamics of the Indian Ocean, the warmest of the five oceans in the world, according to Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. The weather system in the Indian Ocean largely depends on a simple but unpredictable natural phenomenon called the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD).

Warmer water temperatures in the Indian Ocean means warmer air, which tends to rise, much like hot air balloons. The warm water that rises from the ocean is full of moisture, some of which condenses as clouds and returns as rain. The Indian subcontinent is a dividing point between the eastern and western portions of the Indian Ocean. The IOD is calculated as the difference of temperatures between the two parts. When the western part is warmer than the east, it is called a positive dipole.

The IOD has been warmer than usual, Koll said, leading to a large number of storms. The stronger the dipole, the stronger the rainfall and cyclones in the western half of the Indian Ocean. Historically, this dipole has stayed within safe limits. However, the difference crossed 2 degrees Celsius in 2018. It is expected to get worse and more frequent due to climate change.

There was torrential rainfall in 2018 over eastern Africa and the Middle East. The rains were so heavy that lakes formed in the middle of deserts. Such heavy and unusually moist deserts provide the best breeding ground for desert locusts.

‚ÄúIf this trend of increasing frequency of cyclones continues, whether attributed to climate change or just a temporary anomaly in weather patterns, then desert locust outbreaks similar to what is occurring this year in eastern Africa will likely increase,‚Äù Cressman said. ‚ÄúThis can affect India because any swarms that form in north Somalia in May and June can be carried by the winds across the Indian Ocean to Rajasthan for summer monsoon breeding.‚Äù

‚ÄúLow-pressure systems and several rainfall events in eastern Africa is likely to have triggered the locust outbreak,‚Äù Koll said. He said that there is growing evidence that there is increased precipitation in dry regions due to climate change. This greening of arid areas could lead to increased pestilence.

A recent scientific report published in the Nature journal has shown that there is increased rainfall in northwest India that has led to an increase in soil moisture and vegetation in the Thar Desert. ‚ÄúClimate change might exert more substantial impacts on the ecosystem in arid and semi-arid regions than in the humid regions, owing to the high sensitivities and vulnerabilities to rainfall variations of the former,‚Äù the researchers said.

What the future holds

It is fortunate that the locust swarming in India happened after the spring harvest was gathered, according to a locust official in Rajasthan. Had this taken place at the usual time of July onwards, it could have spelt disaster for farmers who are already distressed due to disruptions resulting from the coronavirus crisis.

‚ÄúWe must prevent the further breeding of locusts so that they are unable to affect the kharif (summer) season,‚Äù the official said.

Given that the chances of locust proliferation are increasing in South Asia due to global warming and climate change, India must design appropriate strategies to combat the menace in the interest of food security, experts said.

‚ÄúPreparedness is key to the fight against desert locust swarms, followed by rapid action,‚Äù Cressman said. ‚ÄúRegular and complete monitoring, timely information and reporting, and effective control operations are key elements in this strategy.‚Äù

""Posting about it or making the jokes about it makes it feel somehow less real but also more manageable,"" the high school science teacher from New Haven, Connecticut, tells AFP.

The tone of the humor isn't to everyone's taste -- some may find it a little on the nail, and not exactly laugh-out-loud funny.

But for younger social media users, a gag that others could find flippant is sometimes a howl of frustration over the powerlessness of a generation unable to jam on the brakes in a world heading for the cliff edge.

Embracing absurdity

Society has long turned to grim humor in dark times, of course, in political cartoons, comedy clubs, topical TV shows and numerous other forms.

But the new generation of morose mirthmakers has been able to take gallows humor out of smoke-filled bars and into the pantheon of internet virality (pun intended).

And as 2020 grows increasingly unpredictable and absurd, the onslaught of boundary-pushing irreverence has intensified.

In January, budding wits flooded social media with jokes about getting conscripted for World War III, after the death of top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in a US airstrike.

""Really looking forward to dying in the Strait of Hormuz just so Trump can get reelected,"" Nick Golden, 26, quipped in a now-deleted Facebook post, just after the news of Soleimani's death broke.

Golden, a government employee in Haverhill, Massachusetts, knew it was unlikely that the government would actually start drafting conscripts.

But for young men turning 18, the reality of even having to be on a register from which they could be plucked for battle brings with it the ever-present, low-level thrum of existential angst.

Joking, then, ""is the only way to cope,"" says Golden. ""We have no choice but to indulge in the absurdity.""

A key element of the jokes is that they stem from what McGraw, the academic, calls ""benign violations.""

The idea is that a situation can be invidious -- a violation of the norm -- without actually doing you much harm. A joke acknowledges the fear but also points out its absurdity.

And that, says McGraw, is why much of the coronavirus humor focuses on the banal, ridiculous but essentially harmless aspects of life under lockdown, such as the annoyance of people hoarding toilet paper.

Far less common are jokes about catching the virus or the pending global economic recession.

""It might be too big a violation right now,"" McGraw said.

'OK to laugh'

Ultimately, the weird memes and the inappropriate jokes are a way for younger people to express their frustration with the world at large.

By poking fun at problems, people achieve a sense of control, deflating their crisis into something less overwhelming.

""One of the things that is incredible about the human condition is our ability to find moments of levity, even in the worst situations,"" said McGraw.

""The fact that people are making jokes is a good sign, because it means that they're being connected.""

Back in New Haven, science teacher Wentzell couldn't agree more.

""If it's okay to laugh at something, then it's not so serious that it's the end of the world right this second,"" he said.

And if nothing else, ""it's so much more comforting to be with 50 other people also screaming that than to be the only person yelling on the street that the world's about to end.""","Mon, 01 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2016/06/01/2016_06_01_5598_1464761727._large.jpg,"['online', 'going', 'gags', 'angst', 'jokes', 'makes', 'mcgraw', 'viral', 'humor', 'youthful', 'way', 'wentzell', 'younger', 'world', 'joke', 'social', 'soothing', 'dark']", 
61,61,FF-2020-000140-IDN,‚ÄòGordon Ramsay: Uncharted‚Äô: Why Season 2‚Äôs Indonesia & Guyana Episodes Stand Out - TVInsider,https://www.tvinsider.com/936740/gordon-ramsay-uncharted-season-2-preview/,"Gordon Ramsay is once again traveling in Uncharted Season 2 to introduce viewers to culinary customs and flavors from around the world.

If you were a fan of the first adventures, you‚Äôre in luck because they‚Äôve upped the ante. ‚ÄúThe weakest episode this season is stronger than the strongest episode from last season,‚Äù executive producer Jon Kroll tells TV Insider.

With local experts and food legends guiding him, Ramsay harvests ingredients, tastes dishes, and is inspired by everyone he meets to prepare a meal that represents the heart of each culture. For Season 2, he traveled to Tasmania, South Africa, Louisiana, Indonesia, Guyana, India, and Norway.

Here, Kroll previews his adventures and dishes.

After seeing what worked and what didn‚Äôt about Season 1, what was your approach to Season 2?

Jon Kroll: The biggest difference between Season 1 and Season 2 was we realized that to a much greater degree than we thought, the people that we put Gordon in scenes with really make a really big difference. If he‚Äôs got someone really fun, he feeds off their energy in a way that nothing else can duplicate.

In a weird way, even though they‚Äôre all real people, casting became important. We dug really deep into how can we make sure everyone we put him with is going to be someone who he has fun with, who he has something to learn with, who will play with him, because some people are like deer in headlights with Gordon. Finding the right people to put him with was the biggest challenge and the thing we put the most energy into.

Is there anything else you‚Äôre doing differently?

We were a little reticent to go too crazy with the adventure component and what we were going to have him do, what kinds of planes we were going to have him jump out of or helicopters and things like that. What we found from the first season is he never said no and he wants more, more, more, so we really focused on upping the ante with the adventure component to it.

The more crazy ingredients that are pushed out over the edge of cliffs or that you have to rappel in with a helicopter to get to, we just looked for more of that kind of thing. Just like with the first season, there was nothing he wouldn‚Äôt do, so we have to now somehow find our way in Season 3 to go even further, and I don‚Äôt know how the hell I‚Äôm going to do that.

What did you most enjoy seeing Gordon doing on these adventures? Where did he appear to be most out of his comfort zone?

The most enjoyable thing for me was in Indonesia when he participates in this tradition of bull racing in a rice paddy, and it just was crazy because it wasn‚Äôt like it was Gordon Ramsay doing it. He was just like a crazy Westerner doing it‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt know who Gordon Ramsay was. The anonymity of it was really fun. Also the activity wasn‚Äôt a Westernized thing like a helicopter. It was something you could only find in Indonesia.

Most out of his comfort zone, that‚Äôs tricky. He‚Äôs kind of a chameleon. He does it all. In Indonesia, it was really challenging because for the first time, we had a chef who was older and even more experienced than him, and so him taking the role of student on in there‚Äîeven though he always learns things from the chef‚ÄîChef William Wongso, who‚Äôs a 73-year-old master of Indonesian cuisine and the international ambassador of Indonesian food, was really his mentor, and he really took to it. They cooked for the governor of the province, so it was our most high stakes meal yet, and it was with someone who was of a caliber that he had never worked with before on the show.

Were there any logistical problems where you almost had to cross something off the list?

All the time. Weather is always a factor for us, so we always have to have an alternative weather plan. Generally, we just shoot through the rain. But we did have something in particular, and I‚Äôm going to refer to Indonesia again, because this was one of our most challenging episodes ever. In Indonesia, it was during the rainy season, so there‚Äôs a scene in which he goes into a cave to fish for prawns, and there were heavy rainstorms, and you would think, ‚Äúgreat, we‚Äôve got a scene in a cave, so that‚Äôs no problem,‚Äù except for the fact that the cave was subjected to flash flooding.

We had to monitor the water levels really, really carefully to make sure it was safe to go into the cave and we could get our crew and everybody out safely. It wasn‚Äôt until the very last minute we got the approval we were going to be able to do this cave scene. We had a backup scene we were going to do, but it wasn‚Äôt nearly as good.

What are some of the other adventures this season?

There‚Äôs some really fun stuff in South Africa because we shot a lot on a game reserve, and we were allowed to get closer to animals than we would ordinarily be able to get because we had a super experienced guide safety person that was working with us. The end result of that is Gordon has to flee from both a rhino and two different hippos in South Africa, and this is definitely the first show I‚Äôve ever worked on in which we had a hippo safety meeting.

There was a scene where he goes fishing in a lake, and we knew there was a strong likelihood there would be a hippo in the lake and there was, and at a certain point, they have to leave because the hippo gets too close because the hippo had a calf. We were ready for that.

But for the final cook, which was next to this lake, we showed up for the cook and there was a hippo in that lake, and that was not planned at all. This was a much angrier, much meaner hippo that actually charged Gordon and the guest chef, Zola Nene, during the cook, and we had to all flee. That was exciting.

What are some of the more adventurous things Gordon will be eating?

Rat is very much on the menu this year. We‚Äôre not talking New York sewer rats here, but both in Guyana and in Louisiana, there are two different types of giant rodents that he eats. As the designated food taster who has to eat everything before he does, I can tell you I wasn‚Äôt super excited about having to eat rat, but in both cases, it was pretty tasty.

What made Tasmania the perfect kick off for the season?

Tasmania is really accessible for viewers. You don‚Äôt want to alienate people or go completely off-grid. You want to have place to go. You don‚Äôt want to start with your craziest place first. Tasmania is a name people know, but they don‚Äôt know much about it. People are fascinated by Australia. But also we knew the food there was phenomenal, the ingredients and everything.

Part of the appeal of Uncharted is people get to live vicariously through all of us through the food, so we knew we‚Äôd have great food, and we also had a great chef and a great contributor, Analiese Gregory, the chef who actually was referred to us by Monique Fiso in the first season, as someone she said was like her. She was a great chef to have. And then Sarah Glover, our female Indiana Jones rugged Aussie character was a great contributor to take him around. We just had great characters.

I can‚Äôt imagine how much crazier it‚Äôs going to get for Season 3.

We‚Äôre definitely going to have to look for places to up the ante, but let‚Äôs just say we have a short list of places that are already on the travel itinerary for next season. Uncharted really is a show that can go on and on, because as we prove with the Louisiana episode, right in America, we have plenty of Uncharted places as well. We‚Äôve got some more Uncharted America coming.

We have some more crazy destinations where he‚Äôs going to go fishing for caiman and stuff like that like he does in Guyana. The Guyana episode, by the way, has more creatures that can kill you than the rest of Uncharted combined. He goes hunting for caiman at night by hand, among other things.

62,62,FF-2020-000140-IDN,Pandemic and climate extremes hit India together | News - Eco-Business,https://www.eco-business.com/news/pandemic-and-climate-extremes-hit-india-together/,"India is no stranger to coping with climate extremes and natural emergencies, but this year is likely to lodge in the national memory as one of the most challenging in recent history.

The Covid-19 pandemic is a global scourge, but India also has many regional and national afflictions to make 2020 a year to forget ‚Äì a massive heatwave, its strongest recorded cyclone, thunderstorms bringing huge hailstones, and floods. Now it is being assailed by all-devouring locust swarms, the worst in 25 years, leaving the land scarred.

Government figures showed more than 5,000 Covid-19 deaths by the end of May. The pandemic is causing a humanitarian crisis as well, with a huge reverse migration of penniless unskilled labourers who have lost their jobs in the cities and are now returning to their rural homes.

Five states ‚Äì Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and parts of Maharashtra ‚Äì have been invaded by the locusts. The swarms normally arrive to breed in June or July but this year the first flew in in mid-April, helped to spread by a strong west wind. Climate scientists say warmer waters in the western Indian Ocean also worsened the problem.

The only saving grace is that there are not many standing crops in many of the affected districts, as the monsoon sowing is yet to begin. ‚ÄúIt is only the vegetables, orchards and trees that are the victims of this attack,‚Äù an official said.

‚Äú This is an emergency situation. These desert locusts will not only leave a severe impact on India‚Äôs food production but also deal a double whammy to the farmers, who are already reeling from the economic lockdown. Devinder Sharma, food and trade policy analyst

As the locust threat developed, a range of devastating climate events hit the country in May, starting with heavy rain and hail which killed 29 people in Uttar Pradesh, India‚Äôs most populous state. Next came Cyclone Amphan, bringing sustained windspeeds of 270 kms per hour.

It was the strongest storm ever recorded in the Bay of Bengal. When it hit the coast on 20 May more than 80 people died. West Bengal, on the eastern coast bordering Bangladesh, suffered a trail of destruction. The winds even damaged the tiger stronghold of the Sunderbans, the islands whose mangrove forests in the delta of three major rivers normally give Bengal some protection from the storms.

Amphan‚Äôs rampage caused the evacuation of 300,000 people to shelter. Many acres of agricultural land near the coast were flooded by salty water and are now unusable. The government estimated the initial losses caused by the cyclone at one trillion rupees (US$13.2 billion).

Amphan‚Äôs storm surge was among its most dangerous threats. Global sea levels have already increased by about 23 cm as a result of human carbon emissions ‚Äì dramatically increasing the distance that the surges can reach. Sea levels in the North Indian Ocean have risen more quickly than in many oceans elsewhere in recent years.

Assam struck

Amphan‚Äôs tail also left its mark on the northeastern state of Assam, which experienced heavy rainfall and flooding in low-lying areas, and then several days later a massive thunderstorm. On 27 May, as the Brahmaputra and its tributaries rose above danger point at several places, over 300 villages experienced heavy flooding.

Nor was that all. The same week maximum temperatures reached 40-45C¬∞ in much of northern and central India. While Delhi sizzled at 45-46¬∞, Churu in Rajasthan touched 50¬∞C. Fortunately, there have been no deaths reported this year of farm workers and street vendors, as many people remain locked in their homes because of the virus.

As India braces for the annual monsoon, the government is claiming that it has contained much of the locust threat. But Devinder Sharma, an agriculture and trade policy expert, said: ‚ÄúThe government‚Äôs preparedness has been too slow to keep pace with this rapid increase in locust swarms.

‚ÄúThis is an emergency situation and requires emergency measures. These desert locusts will not only leave a severe impact on India‚Äôs food production but also deal a double whammy to the farmers, who are already reeling from the economic lockdown caused by Covid-19.‚Äù

63,63,FF-2020-000140-IDN,How coffee growers can adapt to a precipitous industry: Q&A with Dean's Beans founder Dean Cycon - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2020/06/how-coffee-growers-can-adapt-to-a-precipitous-industry-qa-with-deans-beans-founder-dean-cycon/,"Climate change is making traditional coffee-growing areas in the tropics less suitable for the crop, forcing farmers to look for new land at higher elevations and higher latitudes.

Scientists are trying to tackle the problem by developing climate-resistant coffee plants, but solutions already exist from arid regions in Africa that can be adapted by farmers in Latin America.

‚ÄúThis is something the scientific community is completely ignoring,‚Äù says Dean Cycon, founder of Dean‚Äôs Beans Organic Coffee and a longtime advocate of social justice for the millions of coffee farmers in the global south.

In an interview with Mongabay, Cycon offers his unique insights into one of the world‚Äôs favorite beverages, the challenges of climate change, the plight of tropical farmers, and the solutions he sees as still within reach.

Dean Cycon spoke recently to students at Harvard Business School. A student asked him what his profit margin was at Dean‚Äôs Beans Organic Coffee, a company he founded in 1993 in western Massachusetts using beans grown by small-scale farmers around the world.

‚ÄúEnough,‚Äù Cycon said. It was an unusually succinct answer for someone who prefers long, involved responses to questions he regularly fields regarding what he‚Äôs learned in more than four decades of working to improve the plight of the working poor in rural communities throughout Latin America, Africa and Asia.

Cycon started some 45 years ago as an environmental attorney working in indigenous communities. He eventually settled on coffee as a means of promoting social justice, environmental protection and improved health care and water quality. He did this by paying well above the often low, open-market price for coffee paid by large retailers. This enabled his suppliers to earn a living, farm more sustainably on less land, and thus reduce the pressure to deforest in order to grow a larger crop.

Yet in a world where 400 billion cups of coffee are consumed annually, climate change in the tropics is dramatically impacting how and where coffee can be grown. One unintended, but increasingly common, climate impact is mass migration. Farmers paid too little for a crop that‚Äôs become difficult to grow are flooding north, fueling the immigration crisis playing out on the southern border of the United States.

In a Mongabay interview, Cycon offered his unique insights into one of the world‚Äôs favorite beverages, the challenges of climate change, the plight of tropical farmers, and the solutions he sees as still within reach.

Mongabay: How has climate change, with its steadily warming temperatures, affected how coffee is grown around the world?

Dean Cycon: Globally, coffee is grown in about 85 countries about 35 degrees north and south of the equator, between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. One immediate impact of climate change is that that band is widening. For the first time in history, coffee is being grown in Southern California. That‚Äôs shocking.

Is that something to be concerned about?

It‚Äôs not a good or bad thing. It‚Äôs just the migration of crops as we adapt to climate change. As with every plant, coffee has its own range of temperatures, its own specific need for rainfall at a specific time. Climate change is disrupting the primary factors that allow coffee to grow as a plant as we know it.

So scientists are making the rush to hybridize plants to adapt into different climate conditions. But that comes at the cost of many things. The first thing is quality. Scientists are less interested in quality than hardiness. And so a lot of hybrids coming out are not suitable for good coffee. It‚Äôs like a crabapple compared to a McIntosh. And governments are funding the hell out of that kind of research, and government agencies are pushing for that kind of planting.

Many people hearing that might think that‚Äôs a good thing, that scientists are trying to figure out how to adapt a popular consumer good so that it can thrive in changing climates. You don‚Äôt see it the same way.

Coffee may be a commodity, but the people who grow it are not. In most of the places I work around the world, coffee is the sole income crop to farmers, even those who try to diversify and grow other things. Because coffee is grown in distant mountains, not in the middle of cities, they really don‚Äôt have access to markets other than what they can grow and trade locally. If you take away the cash crop, it changes the economics of life in villages all around the world. And remember, most of the world‚Äôs coffee ‚Äî 60% or more ‚Äî is grown by small-scale farmers. The rest is grown on large plantations.

This comes back to the social justice element that has driven much of your career.

Yes, it does. At the end of the day, none of these issues we‚Äôre talking about ‚Äî healthy ecosystems, clean water, poverty ‚Äî exist in a vacuum. They are all interrelated. So we can‚Äôt tease out one aspect of this with a scientific fix, which is what we usually try to do. Whether it‚Äôs COVID-19 or climate change or coffee, we can‚Äôt tease out one element of this ‚Äî let‚Äôs make the plants hardier and move them somewhere else ‚Äî and not have a range of dramatic impacts.

China is now a big place for new crops of coffee. Big coffee purchasers are invested heavily in growing coffee in China. OK, that‚Äôs a possibility of a new area for growing. Poor farmers there will have an opportunity for income. But it comes at the expense of 25 million coffee-growing families all around the world, and poverty in those regions is always one crop failure away.

Let‚Äôs talk specifically about how climate change in the tropics, where virtually all of the world‚Äôs coffee is still grown, is being affected by climate change.

There‚Äôs a trophic cascade. And it starts with the changing temperatures. Coffee thrives in a narrow temperature band. If you move up 1 degree or 2 degrees, the plant can‚Äôt survive. Because of the heat, the plant itself is seeking a cooler climate, and farmers are planting higher and higher upslope where it‚Äôs cooler. The higher up you get, the less land there is, the more you may have to deforest, the more chemicals you may need to use, and the more species habitats are disrupted.

What else?

Rainfall. Rainfall patterns are already seriously disrupted all over the tropics. Rain no longer reliably comes at the right time or in the right quantities. There might be a one-month delay in the rainy season, which means that the flowers that have to develop for the bean to come, those flowers are not developing. Instead, they are withering and falling off. Which means no coffee beans. Or the rain comes, and it‚Äôs not the typical quarter-inch a day, but rather a deluge that leads to erosion and landslides. Plants are not developing properly because of too much water.

Disease is a factor, too, isn‚Äôt it?

Yes. The diseases attacking coffee are much stronger very recently than they‚Äôve ever been. The major disease is a wind-blown fungus called la roya ‚Äî the rust. We‚Äôve had major outbreaks that wiped out 30 to 40% of all coffee in Mexico, Colombia and northern Peru a few years ago. If a plant gets la roya, it can‚Äôt be trimmed off. You need to pull it out of the ground and burn it. You lose that plant. Or you can lose an entire crop. When you replant, it takes about five years before that plant is producing beans you can sell. Farmers hardest hit by rust lose their income for that period of time, and it‚Äôs devastating.

We‚Äôre not going to stop climate change, so what are the opportunities for farmers in these rural communities in the tropics to adapt their coffee-growing strategies?

There are parts of the world where drylands coffee are the norm. Ethiopia. Yemen. Kenya. They already use different techniques to make sure the soil stays moist during a drought. There are adaptation techniques that could benefit farmers, and we try to cross-educate between different regions of the world so that the farmers in Latin America can learn from farmers in Africa regarding crop protection in a hotter environment. These techniques are simply drip irrigation and heavy mulching to prevent evaporation and pruning that allows more circulation of air, which helps the plants.

So you‚Äôre spreading this knowledge as parts of Latin America are starting to look more like parts of Africa?

Exactly. But this is something the scientific community is completely ignoring.

Why?

They are looking for technological fixes. But here‚Äôs a counterpoint: in Nicaragua, when the rust hit really badly, we were talking with farmers in different co-ops and we found a small group of farmers up on this one ridge, and they said they have a plant that was unaffected (by rust). The coffee species is called Indio ‚Äî the original coffee plant in that region that only grows in one area. It‚Äôs a high-quality bean. Indio ‚Äì if people would take it and replant it elsewhere, it would solve the problem of trying to scientifically modify crops elsewhere because you already have a species that is rust-proof.

Then, in another part of Guatemala, they were hybridizing a Robusta base (a coffee bean of lower quality) and grafting in Arabica branches (Arabica is the highest-quality bean). Robusta plants are much more resistant to heat and rust than Arabica. And it‚Äôs working, but at a small scale. There is no real emphasis on this kind of widespread cross-education between farmers in different countries or different parts of the world. But it would go a lot further than spending $10 million in a lab where solutions are production-based rather than community-based.

In a previous interview with Mongabay, you spoke about the potential for adaptability in coffee growing through agroforestry ‚Äî literally planting coffee plants in forests, between the trees. Is shade-grown coffee and agroforestry part of the way that smaller communities, smaller growers, can adapt to rising temperatures?

Yes. The soil protective mechanisms in agroforestry, the multi-storied shade in agroforestry, all serve to create a more conducive environment for that plant to make it more resistant to rising temperatures. On the rainfall side, you have shade in the hottest part of the day when the rain isn‚Äôt coming, and allow soil adsorption if rain comes too fast. An agroforestry system for coffee is much better adapted to withstand early stage climate change than monoculture coffee crops grown on large plantations. Coffee is an understory crop. It was originally found in the forests.

So how radical a change is this for coffee growers in Latin America to be moving their crops upslope and into the forests?

For many coffee farmers, they are leaning in that direction, because they are small scale. The average coffee grower only has a few acres. Very small. They are already in forested areas. It‚Äôs not a far cry to improve the agricultural productivity and sustainability of those farms because they area already on that path.

However, this where it gets difficult. If I am a coffee farmer and I need money to hire people and get the crops ready, I go to the bank. And the bank says, ‚ÄúWhat do you produce per acre?‚Äù The farmer projects a yield and gets a loan. But then I say, ‚ÄúI am moving into agroforestry, so I‚Äôll be limiting the number of coffee bushes and we‚Äôre moving them around, and planting them in different places. For the first few years it will lessen my yield, but soon I‚Äôll be just as productive with higher-quality beans.‚Äù Unfortunately, the bank sees risk. It can‚Äôt predict your yield. So either you get a loan with a higher rate of interest to cover that risk, or no loan at all. The farmer is then faced with a choice. This is where two systems come into conflict. Changing to adapt to climate change costs the farmer more because banks see a higher risk. So for farmers, it‚Äôs harder than you might imagine to break away to farm differently.

But if they keep doing the same thing, they lose their crops to heat, drought, or pests. What choice do they have?

Not much. So they are leaving their farms behind and trying to migrate to North America. The largest individual group of immigrants slamming up against the southern border of the U.S. over the last two years have been coffee farmers from Guatemala. They are climate immigrants and economic immigrants. They‚Äôve lost their land and can‚Äôt generate income.

But it seems there is an option for them to move their crops upslope with agroforestry techniques if they had the economic support to do it.

We are at the cusp here ‚Äî of an old way of farming and an old way of dealing with the environment and the need for adaptation. It‚Äôs a time issue. Can farmers adapt in time? They could if there was enough financial support. It would also help if coffee companies were willing to pay more for the coffee crop. That would help the immigration problem enormously. If coffee companies paid a more reasonable price for coffee, there would be far less migration. These farmers would be able to support themselves.

Consumers are paying more than ever for coffee, but the farmers have been getting less and less. For several years, the commodity price of coffee has hovered around the farmer‚Äôs cost of production, which means no profit for farmers. From a high in 2014, the prices paid to farmers have plummeted by 70% and now dance around a dollar a pound. Every pound a farmer sells, and every cup we drink, pushes a farmer deeper into poverty and despair.

If you could sit down with leaders of international lending and aid institutions, what would you recommend to keep millions of coffee farmers in the places where they have grown coffee for generations?

I‚Äôd recommend several things. Governments, aid institutions and nonprofit development organizations need to put more resources into agroforestry as well as helping share information from dryland farmers to tropical farmers about how to survive in a changing climate. That‚Äôs easily done.

Also, the coffee industry needs to do a better job of paying a fair price to growers. The value of a coffee crop is disassociated from its true cost. The price of coffee is determined in the New York Board of Trade and the impact on the farmer is destructive. The pricing mechanism of coffee does not support keeping farmers alive. I‚Äôve been talking about getting off the commodity pricing for years and sharing the risk. Right now, all the risk is on the farmer.

Finally, consumers need to get real information so they can make informed decisions on the coffee they buy. So many of these labels claiming to be ‚Äúfair trade‚Äù are misleading in terms of what‚Äôs actually happening. If there is a way for consumers to get real information, then they can make real informed choices and push for a sustainable solution for coffee farmers.

Recent research predicts that half of all coffee-growing land will be unsuitable for farming by 2050 because of climate change. There are an estimated 130 million coffee drinkers in the U.S. alone. Are future generations at risk of being without their morning coffee?

There will be coffee. There may not be as many companies or as much variety. There will a lessening of quality to keep the quantity up. Prices will be higher. And the impact on the local farmer growing coffee throughout the Third World? Devastation and massive migration. So, we‚Äôll have coffee, but there will be a lot more dislocation and poverty in the global south.

As of 5 June 2020, 217,694 positive COVID-19 cases were confirmed in East Asia and Pacific, with 8,821 deaths. Among these, Indonesia (28,233) and Philippines (18,997) are the worst affected.

UNICEF continues supporting governments with the ‚ÄúBack to School Campaign‚Äù. So far, 12 countries in East Asia and Pacific have started the gradual reopening of schools, with 191 million children reportedly back in school in China and Viet Nam alone. In countries where schools are not open, UNICEF supports the continued learning of over 41 million distance learners and is providing 49 million people with mental and psychosocial support.

UNICEF is also supporting governments with their infection prevention and control (IPC) measures as well as communicating lifesaving and accurate information on COVID-19. To date, UNICEF with its partners reached over 741 million people with COVID-19 messages in the region.

East Asia and the Pacific is the region with the highest absolute number of cash transfers beneficiaries ‚Äìwith 357 million individuals covered, or 15% of the total regional population. It is estimated that over US$ 140 billion has been spent by national governments on social assistance alone in East Asia and the Pacific.

Out of a US$137 million appeal for the East Asia and Pacific region, against the Global Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) Appeal of US$1.6 billion, to date US$65 million has been received, leaving a US$72 million funding gap.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The number of new COVID-19 cases continues to decline in most countries across the region. As a result, many governments are gradually loosening their lockdown restrictions, including the reopening of businesses and the gradual reopening of schools; however, restrictions on border crossings and flight operations remain largely in effect. It is estimated that over 400 million children in the East Asia and Pacific region might be affected by the economic crisis. UNICEF is actively contributing to the joint UN socio-economic assessment for COVID-19 as part of the joint UN Task Force.

The consequences of lockdowns, including economic impacts for families, continue to adversely affect the wellbeing of children and young people, including an increased risk of school dropout, violence, sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), exploitation, abuse and neglect. Survey results from Indonesia indicate that women and children are experiencing more violence and stress at home. Furthermore, economic vulnerability, closed borders and anti-migrant attitudes are likely to increase trafficking in persons in the region. In Cambodia, traffickers are reportedly taking advantage of migrant labourers desperate to return to Thailand for economic reasons. Meanwhile, in Lao PDR, UNICEF has noted an increase in reported cases of domestic violence and sexual abuse of children. In the Philippines, the Department of Justice-Office of Cybercrime reported that there has been a 264% increase in the number of reported online sexual exploitation of children in the country during the lockdown.

In terms of health care provision, global demand for testing supplies, personal protective equipment (PPE) and oxygen therapy supplies still exceeds available stocks. Infections among health workers remains an area of concern, signalling the continued need for provision of adequate PPE for frontline health and social workers. In addition, the postponement of routine immunisation in East Asia and Pacific countries including in Myanmar, Indonesia, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, and Papua New Guinea poses additional risks of disease outbreaks among children. The impact of COVID-19 on the availability of and access to sexual and reproductive health care has also been reported. A survey by the International Planned Parenthood Federation showed that in East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Pacific, 64% of Member Associations reported a decrease in the number of service delivery points and 76% reported having to scale down the availability of services.

On a positive note, some schools in China, Viet Nam, Papua New Guinea, several Pacific Islands and Lao PDR have begun to cautiously reopen. So far, 191 million children are reportedly back in school in China and Viet Nam. Governments are opting for a gradual and staggered return to school of specific grades and/or number of children. In some countries where schools were used as quarantine sites, those schools are now being emptied and cleaned to resume classes. For children not yet returning to school, online lessons and distance learning continues but remains a challenge, particularly for children without internet access.

Continued efforts are needed in order to ensure that the number of new cases do not flare up again and to support health systems, communities and families to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. In order to support governments in meeting these challenges, UNICEF is working with governments and partners across the region.","Fri, 05 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1521196-UNICEF%20EAPRO%20COVID-19%20SitRep%20No.%208%2C%2023%20May-5%20June%202020%20-%20updated.png?itok=GwEFpGLJ,"['east', 'schools', 'report', 'republic', 'asia', 'governments', 'peoples', 'million', 'region', 'reporting', 'novel', 'children', 'reported', 'situation', 'pacific', 'period', 'unicef', 'school']",

Here's how you can file for claim

Motor Insurance Claim: India has witnessed two 'severe' cyclonic storms, Amphan and Nisarga, which had struck eastern and western coastal regions in less than two weeks and had led to extensive destruction of life and property. Several vehicles like cars and bikes were damaged and submerged in water due to the cyclone storm, which was followed by heavy rain and thunderstorm.

If your cars and bikes have also suffered loss or damage due to strong winds, then this is for you. The cost incurred for the vehicles (car and bike) can be recovered by a motor insurance product.

To be noted, motor own damage (OD) cover offers financial protection against losses due to natural catastrophes like a cyclone, flash floods, landslides, storm and earthquake.

If your vehicle hsa been damaged in the recent two cyclones, here's what you should do to file a claim with your insurance company.

Important: First Inform the Insurer

If you are an insured victim, then first you need to do intimate your insurer about the incident. In case your vehicle has suffered damage after a tree or something fell on it, don‚Äôt attempt to remove it. You may further damage the vehicle in this process and the claims payment process will thereafter be delayed.

You need to inform the insurers by either writing to them or calling them on their toll-free numbers or customer service numbers, within 48 hours. Then, you need to provide all the related details of the incident and the vehicle involved. Once you register your claim, you will be given a registration number.

Keep pictorial evidence:

Due to nationwide-lockdown in the view of coronavirus, the general insurers across India are allowing the filling of a claim online. However, you need to submit pictures of the damaged vehicle to show the extent of damage, according to which the claim will be provided.

How to file claims for motor insurance:

It is no surprise that severe cyclonic storms Amphan and Nisarga have left tonnes of cars and bikes damaged. A regular policy which covers both - own damage and third-party liability will be sufficient in such cases.

Insurers might also provide documentation waivers. Also, they may accept photographs shared digitally to settle motor insurance claims.

What you need to do:

Provide the insurer with basic information such as your name, phone number, and car number. The insurer will then be able to pull out your policy information with the help of these details.

Once you register your claim, you need to wait for further instructions from the insurer as the vehicle will be towed to the nearest garage to ascertain further losses.

Here‚Äôs what you need to provide to your insurer:

Your contact numbers

Car insurance policy number

Name of insured person

Date and time of accident

Vehicle number

Make and model

Location of the incident

Brief description of the incident

Name of driver

Place and contact details of the insured person if the person intimating the claim is not insured

In 1975 when Tan Sen Thay fled his native land Indonesia he arrived in the Netherlands with just two gulden and a traditionally woven West Papuan noken bag.

The Chinese Indonesian claimed to Dutch immigration authorities that he was a senior representative of The West Papuan government, a predominantly black elite from a Melanesian province in Indonesia ºs most Eastern federation.

Their government was on a critical stage waging a poorly equipped rebellion for independence.

""If we do not get Dutch assistance immediately, we will be wiped out,"" he warned.

Tan Sen insisted that the Dutch had a moral obligation to help West Papua. After the infamous Trikora incident between the Netherlands and Indonesia in 1961, the Dutch were forced to relinquish Papua under international pressure.

In 1969, West Papua was annexed by Indonesia in a highly criticised referendum known as the Act of Free Choice.

Some 1025 tribal leaders were rounded up to vote for the political status of a population of nearly one million native Papuans while Indonesian soldiers allegedly held entire villages at gunpoint. The participants voted unanimously for Indonesian control.

Serious allegations of human rights violations would follow, including claims of war crimes and genocide committed against indigenous Papuans. Tan Sen and his comrades swore they would not accept the result of the referendum, but would continue battling Indonesia for the fate of the resource-rich island.

Photo: Rohan Radheya

The Dutch government realised that by deporting Tan Sen, he would almost certainly be persecuted at return. He was granted political asylum in The Netherlands.

After first setting foot in The Netherlands, Tan Sen started working in an old garage in the Hague, just a few miles away from the Dutch Parliament.

""I then picked the Hague, the seat of the Dutch parliament because the Dutch government had a moral obligation to free my country,"" he said.

The garage was a famous hotspot for producing golf cars that were nationally renowned in those days.

As a mechanic Tan Sen earned a minimum wage of 1000 gulden a month (about US$500 at the time) for working 80 hours a week. He would send the majority of his pay back to his comrades in West Papua who were launching sporadic hit and run attacks on Indonesian soldiers from the rugged forests of West Papua.

The remaining money he would wrap in a loin cloth and hide under his pillow while just surviving on simple instant noodles.

""A penny saved is a penny earned, that was my motto,"" he said. After toiling for 12 years Tan Sen decided he had saved enough money to open his own gift-shop.

He named it after West Papua ºs capital Hollandia (now named Jayapura).

His antique gift shop sold everything from imported porcelain statues and rare astrological gem stones to Confucian art paintings and cheap Chinese jewellery.

Money started to flow in and Tan Sen ºs hard work began to pay off. He intensified his contributions to the Organisasi Papua Merdeka or OPM ( Free Papua Movement).

Photo: NGRWP

Tan Sen is still living in the Hague today, two blocks away from my home. In spring 2016 when I visited Tan Sen in the Hague he had closed his shop and converted it into his home.

Aged 92 and in perfect health, he had by then already made enough savings to secure his retirement. A wise Confucian who holds some of the best kept secrets to a lost history, Tan is still hoping one day to return to his beloved fatherland.

Warning me not to take photos and to leave my phone in the hall with my shoes, he shows me old documents that ''no one has ever seen"": old black and white photos of West Papuan guerrillas in the 1970's, transaction data from high profile West Papuan sympathisers around the globe and testimonials from freshly joined recruits worldwide.

""Did you know that during the fall of Soeharto, one of his relatives came to us and offered us $500,000 to purchase arms?'' Tan Sen asks.

I'm a little bit sceptical until he shows me records with numbers, dates, and figures relating to a foreign bank account.

He tells me that before he will die, he will send all documents to Leiden University in the Netherlands and sell them for a million euros. The profit will go to his West Papuan wife.

Photo: Rohan Radheya

For years Tan Sen designed and weaved handmade uniforms, then smuggled them back to the OPM via refugee camps in areas near the border with PNG.

He would also arrange asylum for West Papuan refugees and finance their trips overseas to help them resettle in countries such as Sweden and Greece.

West Papuans who later took asylum in all corners of Europe had heard about him. In admiration at what he did for West Papua, they would address him as 'Meneer Tan' (Lord Tan) or 'Bapak Tan' (Father Tan) and send him homemade sago cakes with flowers and gifts.

If anyone wanted to join the independence movement abroad, Tan Sen was the only one mandated by the leadership of the OPM to take their oath of loyalty.

Recruits had to put their right hand on the bible, and smell the outlawed West Papuan morning star flag. If Tan Sen deemed them fit, they could join.

The Quest for Nationhood

Tan Sen Thay was born in Surabaya, Indonesia in a wealthy Chinese family. Growing up as a Chinese Indonesian during the 1965 communist purge by Soeharto, his family fled to West Papua in fear of persecution. His parents were Hokkien transmigrants who migrated to Indonesia from China in search of a better life.

After making generous contributions to Papuan communities, his family soon started to build a respected reputation around The Abepura neighbourhood in West Papua ºs capital Jayapura. When young Tan Sen saw mass human rights violations committed against West Papuans at the hands of the Indonesian Army, it angered him.

He made a drastic decision. The next day he would depart to the jungles to join the Papuan movement led by a former Papuan-Indonesian Sergeant named Seth Jafeth Rumkorem.

Rumkorem was a young charismatic Papuan officer trained in the Indonesian military academy in Bandung. His father Lukas Rumkorem had been part of a nationalistic Indonesian militia called Barisan Merah Putih. Initially both father and son opened their arms for the Indonesians after Dutch departure.

But after seeing Indonesian cruelty committed against his fellow countrymen, Seth Rumkorem would soon defect and go on to orchestrate a decades-long rebel insurgency from the Papuan jungles against the Indonesian army over the fate of the Western half of New Guinea island.

On 1 July 1971 Rumkorem and his followers gathered in the border areas with PNG. The intention was to boycott Papuan-Indonesian elections. In consultation with Tan Sen and other prominent Papuans, Rumkorem proclaimed a constitution, senate, army, national flag, and anthem.

The proclamation read as follows:

''To all the people of Papua, from Numbai to Merauke, from Sorong to Baliem(Star Mountains) and from Biak to Adi Island. With the help and blessing of God Almighty, we take this opportunity to declare to you all that today, 1 July 1971, the land and people of Papua have been proclaimed to be free and independent (de facto and de jure) May God be with us, and may the world be advised, that the true will of the people of Papua to be free and independent in their own homeland has been met.''

Sink or Swim

Tan Sen was a pious, gentle-mannered introvert with no real experience in war but with his steadfast loyalty and ethnic background he was considered the ultimate propaganda tool by his senior black commanders. Rumkorem appointed him as Minister of Finance in his cabinet.

Tan was asked to travel abroad to lobby for West Papuan independence. With a small delegation Tan Sen set off to London, Senegal and Solomon Islands to muster international support. His fellow comrades under the leadership of Rumkorem would stay fighting from the dense Papuan bush until Tan Sen and co managed to find diplomatic support.

""But without outside help it was impossible,"" claimed Louis Nussy, one of Rumkorem ºs most trusted associates, who explained that their small force couldn't match the Indonesian Army for equipment.

""The Indonesians were supplied by allies such as Russia and the United States. We were just depending on old rusty mouser rifles that we occasionally managed to snatch away from Indonesian soldiers,"" he explained.

""There was no ammunition. We would just melt iron in the midst of the jungle,"" he said.

Rumkorem and his comrades continued to suffer heavy casualties, and were losing huge terrain on a daily basis. After being pushed out of cities such as Jayapura, Biak and Manokwari, Rumkorem started to realise that it was a 'sink or swim' situation. He and his supporters retreated back to the forests while Tan Sen ended up taking asylum in the Netherlands.

Tan ran out of funds to continue his lobby abroad. ""Returning would be suicide,"" he later testified.

""A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. This was certainly the case in our context,"" said Louis Nussy, who is now exiled in Greece.

""We were very efficient in guerrilla tactics but without proper hardware we were facing tough sledding.

""We realised it was just a matter of time before we would be captured or killed,"" he explained.

In the meantime with Tan abroad, Rumkorem gained valuable intelligence from fellow independence fighters who had fled to Australia. A cell of West Papuan sympathisers at the highest political level in Vanuatu, were secretly willing to lend weapons and ammunition.

In 1982, Rumkorem decided to leave for the PNG border town of Vanimo to sail to Vanuatu. He was accompanied by eight of his most trusty men.

The plan was straightforward. Rumkorem would leave for arms and return back in a month.

He summoned his intelligence branch PIS (Papua Intelligence Service) and ordered them to obtain accurate weather schedules in PNG waters.

""What Rumkorem did not know was that the head of his intelligence unit had been detained and tortured by the notorious Indonesian special forces Kopassanda,' º said Sonny Saba, one of Rumkorem ºs eight companions.

""In jail he was bribed and given the task to become an informant we would later found out.

""The enemies strategy was clear. Lure away the shepherd and there will just be sheep,"" explained Saba, who now lives in exile in PNG.

""Rumkorem knew Indonesian Army tactics inside out, since he was a former Indonesian sergeant.""

""When he was away, the rebels would be a body without a brain,"" he said.

The head of Rumkorem ºs intelligence unit then came up with a date just before a devastating storm would strike PNG waters.

Rumkorem left full leadership on the shoulders of his defence minister, Richard Joweni and departed to Vanuatu.

Facing the storm, their prao (traditional Melanesian boat) broke down in the Pacific Ocean and they ended up stranded in Rabaul without food and supplies.

Fearing Indonesian pressure, PNG officials told Rumkorem they could not stay, but they also did not want to extradite them.

In Rabaul, the Papuans met NY Times journalist Colin Campbell. Rumkorem declared to him that his movement sought a revolution, universal human rights, freedom, democracy and social justice.

When asked if it included any Marxist factions, he replied, ''No, our country is a Christian country.''

Betrayal

When Rumkorem eventually realised that there were no weapons in Vanuatu, he called Tan Sen in the Hague.

""Rumkorem was crying, and understood he was tricked,"" said Tan Sen. ""He told me he wanted to return to West Papua.""

""I told him that I gained valuable intelligence that the Indonesians had sealed the border and were waiting for his return... returning would be suicide.""

""Don't bite off more than you can chew,"" I told him.

""Discredition is the better part of valour and you are no use to us death, I warned him.""

Tan Sen then arranged asylum for Rumkorem in Greece.

From Greece, Rumkorem migrated to the Netherlands from where he continued to lobby for West Papuan independence till his death in 2010, in Wageningen.

Rumkorem ºs departure would be a devastating blow for the remaining West Papuan fighters in the forest who had few or no military experience nor weapons.

Rumkorem ºs successor in West Papua Richard Joweni continued to wage a three-decades long guerrilla insurgency after Rumkorem ºs departure, but he was also no match against the modern weapons of the Indonesian army.

Fearing the death of more of his men, Joweni finally signed a ceasefire with Jakarta ºs special envoy Dr Farid Hussein in 2011, known as the 11-11-11-11 agreement.

The deal was brokered on 11 November 2011, at 11 o'clock at OPM headquarters in the West Papuan jungle.

Dr Hussein earlier also brokered a ceasefire with the independence movement in Aceh in what led to the Helsinki agreement which provided a basis for peace in the restive Indonesian region.

Joweni would later sneak out of West Papua using a fake passport and travel to Vanuatu to meet with Prime Minister Moana Carcasses Kalosil in 2013.

There he would discuss a proposal to lobby for West Papuan membership in the Melanesian Spearhead Group.

After the death of Joweni in 2015, the quest was carried onwards by the United Liberation Movement for West Papua under the stewardship of Andy Ayamiseba, Rex Rumakiek, Octo Mote and others, then eventually taken over by Oxford-based Benny Wenda.

Having attained observer status in the MSG the ULMWP has gained a measure of international recognition that worries Jakarta.

Duct-taped windows

In Tan Sen's living room hangs several old photos of ancient Confucian war-gods, a religion that was strictly forbidden during Soeharto's rule.

The living room is decorated with several book closets full of rusty files and old documents. He has pasted all windows with duck tape and builded a fence around the glass in fear of Indonesian spies.

Tan Sen claims the military attache of the Indonesian consulate in the Hague recently paid him a visit.

""He asked for a list of West Papuan independence fighters who lived in exile in The Netherlands,"" Tan reveals.

""I would be royally rewarded.""

""What did you do?"" I ask curiously.

""What else? I slammed the door at his nose,"" he laughs viciously.

Tan Sen doesn't trust the internet and doesn't own a smart phone. He doesn't speak English but is fluent in Dutch.

He reads the full Dutch newspaper in the morning, take notes and then puts the newspaper in his archive. Tan has a full closet of newspapers dating back to 1980.

This pioneering figure in the Papuan independence movement uses an old landline number to occasionally remain in contact with his old comrades in the jungle.

He enquires about the latest developments in the MSG where the ULMWP continued to appeal for full membership.

It is as if the world has passed him by. Most West Papuans do not even know he is alive today.

Even Papuan intellectuals, activists, international journalists, and the young generation of Papuan fighters I met during my trips in West Papua did not know who Tan Sen was.

It has become clear that when the first generation of West Papuan independence fighters fled Papua, they took a huge chunk of Papuan history alongside with them.

The result was that the younger Papuan generation lost a huge part of their own history.

When I ask whether he remains optimistic for West Papuan Independence, Tan Sen says he feels disappointed by the new generation of Papuan independence fighters who don't deem him fit to lead them any longer.

They would not visit him or include him in the decision making because they felt he was not a native Papuan and not eligible.

""How would you define a Papuan today?"" he asks.

""There are tens of thousands of Papuans serving in Indonesian armed forces today.

""They consider themselves Indonesians. Why can ºt I consider myself Papuan Melanesian?

""If race would define your identity or nationality, there wouldn't be white Africans or black Europeans today,"" he explains, citing the plight of white Afrikaners in post independent Zimbabwe.

""What will happen to the millions of Indonesian transmigrants that are born in Papua after 1962 and consider themselves Papuan? "" he stresses.

I remain silent. He pauses before concluding.

""I am still optimistic that I can return to a free and independent West Papua one day,"" he shrugs.

The then-agriculture minister Joe Ludwig acted recklessly and committed misfeasance in public office, Justice Steven Rares ruled today.

The Federal Court class action of around 300 members, led by Brett Cattle Company, had sought $600 million.

The current Coalition government will have to pay any damages awarded as a result of the Labor government's ban.

The federal government's 2011 live export ban on cattle has been ruled invalid. (Peter Morris)

Emily Brett, who became a lead litigant in 2014 along with her husband Dougal, said it had been a long nine years for her family.

Mr Brett died in a helicopter crash in 2015.

""This journey started with my husband. I've had to finish the last of this journey on my own. All I want in this moment is to share this day with him,"" Mrs Brett told reporters in Canberra.

""I've kept going because I can hear him saying to me 'don't give up'.""

The issue of live exports had been controversial for many years but became volcanic when a May 2011 ABC Four Corners program aired footage showing the poor treatment of animals in facilities in Indonesia.

The judge said Mr Ludwig made the ban order ""shutting his eyes to the risk that it might be invalid and to the damage that it was calculated to cause persons in the position of Brett Cattle"".

He was satisfied the minister was recklessly indifferent regarding his ability to make such an order without power of exception, and to the injury it would produce.

""Such a total prohibition was capricious and unreasonable and made the ban order invalid,"" the judge said.

""I have found that, had the minister acted lawfully, he would have made a control order on about 9 or 10 June 2011 that contained an exceptions power and that Elders and Santori would have been able to obtain approvals to export to Indonesia under it without delay.""

He ordered the minister and the Commonwealth pay the legal costs, noting Brett Cattle was entitled to substantial damages.

The parties would need to return to court at a later date to determine compensation for the class action members.

Former NT Cattlemen's Association chief Tracey Hayes, who facilitated the class action, said the decision highlighted the dangers of knee-jerk political stunts.

""It has been a decade of pain for the Bretts and others impacted. It has been a long, long road,"" she told reporters in Darwin

She urged the Commonwealth not to appeal.

""This has been nine years. Enough pain already,"" Ms Hayes said.

Animals Australia's Lyn White said the brutality faced by Australian cattle in Indonesia should not be forgotten.

""If anyone is to blame for economic losses that resulted in the temporary halt in trade, it isn't the government that prevented further animal cruelty, it's the industry body that not only ignored it, but facilitated it,"" she said.

The outbreak hit Honduras particularly hard, overwhelming a public health system that had already been weakened by budget cuts and pervasive corruption and was barely equipped to meet usual demands, much less an epidemic of record size. By the end of 2019, Honduras had suffered about 61 percent of the dengue deaths in Central America.

The highest number of dengue cases occurred in the department of Cort√©s, where efforts to control its transmission were further hampered by a lack of trained personnel and by the region‚Äôs ubiquitous criminal gangs, which for months blocked government health care workers from gaining access to some of the hardest-hit neighborhoods.

Dengue remains a major concern in Latin America and the Caribbean this year. According to the latest statistics from the Pan American Health Organization, about 1,426,000 cases have been recorded in the region so far, fewer than during the same period last year.

Delays in claims processing persist as school employees flood state's Work Share program

As the number of furloughed school employees grows, so too, do the weeks of missed unemployment payments.

Participants in the state's Work Share unemployment program have waited weeks, and some months, to see money from the program. The long delays within the Oregon Employment Department are no secret. OED acknowledged it's scrambling to address a backlog of 38,000 claims and over the weekend, the agency's director, Kay Erickson, resigned at the governor's request, after calls for her ouster from Sen. Ron Wyden.

Work Share is a separate program from the state's unemployment insurance benefits, but functions similarly, offering unemployment benefits to employees who have lost hours and pay at work, but still have a job.

The program is meant to incentivize employers to avoid layoffs, offering temporary compensation for a portion of the pay cuts.

When the COVID-19 pandemic caused businesses to close or restrict services, and school closures were mandated across Oregon and the United States, some school districts turned to Work Share to fill an impending budget gap.

Portland Public Schools announced its plans for employee furloughs, and other districts, including several in Washington and Columbia counties, quickly followed suit. The plan, PPS said, was to reduce the work week for all employees, from five days to four, thereby reducing employee pay by 20%. In exchange, employees could file for unemployment benefits through Work Share, and also be eligible for weekly federal benefits through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (or CARES) Act.

The surge in claims has multiplied the state's average claims and stymied the Employment Department's processing times.

""The additional workload coming into the program is immense,"" Gail Krumenauer, a communications director with OED, said on May 15. ""Our agency's COVID-19 dashboard shows that we've processed nearly 1,000 Work Share plans in the past two months. For the 12 months before that, we received less than 200 applications for plans.""

On May 26, OED announced it would continue ""surge hiring"" to address a backlog of 38,000 unemployment claims.

But as leaders from the Oregon Employment Department face scrutiny over heavy delays in claims processing, some school employees could be done working for the year before they see any benefits.

State OED employees say claim processing times will be ""slower than typical,"" and could take up to a month for initial claims associated with new Work Share plans to be processed.

How is Work Share different from Unemployment Insurance benefits?

Work Share claims don't require recipients to look for work each week, and the weekly claims are submitted to the state by a company's human resources or administrative department, rather than the employees themselves. Typically, an HR department manages the claims and acts as a middle man.

Are the claims processed the same way as regular unemployment?

""Work Share claims are processed by a different group of employees than regular unemployment claims or Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) claims,"" said Krumenauer. That should mean staff aren't quite as backlogged as those processing regular UI claims.

With all the state's school employees flooding the program, will it run out of money?

Not likely.

""Oregon has one of the most solvent trust funds of any state in the nation,"" Krumenauer noted. ""We are monitoring our trust fund, and do not see any imminent threats to running out of money. Much of the additional payments that are happening right now ‚Äî like the additional $600 Pandemic Unemployment Compensation payments ‚Äî are fully federally funded.""

Can I get information about my Work Share claim online?

State OED reps say no, but some furloughed employees reported they were able to check their claim status through the OED website.

""Work Share is supposed to be a program that is managed by the employer, and we currently don't grant access to the claim online,"" said Juan Serrators, benefit services manager for OED. Most information is relayed to the employer. For those with questions about their claim, OED recommends calling 503-947-1800, or toll free at 800-436-6191.","Sun, 31 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://pamplinmedia.com/images/artimg/00003673475869-0773.jpg,"['states', 'unemployment', 'oregon', 'school', 'surge', 'claims', 'oed', 'program', 'employees', 'processing', 'state', 'despite', 'work', 'share', 'money']",

76,76,FF-2020-000140-IDN,Bangladesh has saved thousands of lives from a devastating cyclone ‚Äì here‚Äôs how - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/bangladesh-has-saved-thousands-of-lives-from-a-devastating-cyclone-heres-how-139903,"The Atlantic and Caribbean hurricane season has just begun, with the world worried about the prospect of providing humanitarian relief in the context of a pandemic and lockdowns. But Bangladesh recently experienced one of the most powerful Bay of Bengal cyclones on record and saved thousands of lives through forecasting, warning, and evacuation.

This is in stark contrast to the November 1970 cyclone, which killed around 500,000 people in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan), making it one of the deadliest known storms in human history. Around 11,000 died in a 1985 cyclone, and one in 1991 killed 140,000. More recent strikes, such as Cyclone Sidr in 2007 and Cyclone Alia in 2009, had over 3,400 deaths and about 190 deaths respectively.

All these far exceeded the recent Cyclone Amphan‚Äôs total of 26 deaths so far. Understanding the generally declining death toll offers lessons on how the rest of the world could prepare better for such events. Part of it is forecasting, warning, and evacuation.

But another part is local action, which we research. Much of this science is participatory, directed by the people who are vulnerable in order to balance and meld local and external ideas and approaches.

From vulnerability to resilience

Cyclone Amphan made landfall in Bangladesh on May 20 2020. It inundated over 4,000 sq km of land and destroyed homes, polders (low-lying areas of land surrounded by dikes or levees), embankments, roads, electricity poles, mobile phone towers, bridges and culverts, with the exact costs still being tallied. Many agricultural fields and fish farms were overwhelmed by the saltwater storm surge.

The low death toll can be largely attributed to Bangladesh‚Äôs long-term efforts to reduce vulnerabilities, including at the local level, which is always the key in preventing disasters. In 1970, the country had only 42 cyclone shelters, whereas now over 12,000 functionally active cyclone shelters dot the coastline, serving nearly 5 million people.

A diverse system of warning messages tailored to local needs keeps people informed about evacuation, ranging from social media to people on bicycles with megaphones. Training in school means that the announcements are trusted and the population knows how to react and why.

Bangladesh has invested in constructing numerous polders to reduce the force of storm surges, although water retention has sometimes damaged agriculture and infrastructure. Local leaders, organisations, and authorities collaborate to implement tidal river management and nature-based approaches such as mangroves. This helps to deal with storm surge and rainfall, as well as reduced freshwater due to India‚Äôs Farakka Barrage, built across the Ganges River to keep the water in India since the 1970s.

We assessed one local programme funded and supported by the British and Swedish Red Cross for implementation by the Bangladesh Red Crescent. This ‚ÄúVulnerability to Resilience‚Äù programme ran between 2013 and 2016 in the coastal villages of Pashurbunia and Nowapara in Kalapara Upazila in Patuakhali district.

This was the first time that people there had been involved in such resilience-building work. They installed flood-resistant tubewells, raised latrines above expected flood levels, trained for improved hygiene and first aid, distributed safety equipment, improved local early warning and evacuation systems, and were trained as local volunteers to continue these activities.

¬© Taifur Rahman, HMBD Foundation, Bangladesh , Author provided

Diverse and alternative livelihood opportunities were also promoted. Household-level businesses and shops were encouraged, alongside local markets for the products.

This included people growing and selling garden vegetables and rice, producing crafts through quilting and sewing, rearing cattle for milk and beef, and investing in ducks, chickens, and aquaculture for fish. If any one of these livelihoods is interrupted or ruined, then people would still have options for earning income.

These initiatives are clearly not about cyclones only and move far beyond forecasting, warning, and evacuation. They improve livelihoods, living conditions, community interaction, health, and safety irrespective of a storm. Our calculations immediately after the programme demonstrated that every dollar invested in the programme produced a quick payback of almost five times that amount through enhanced income and local activities.

Local success

The real test, though, remains what happens during a hazard. Three weeks after the programme ended, Cyclone Roanu ripped through the south coast of Bangladesh on May 21, 2016. Pashurbunia and Nowapara reported successful warning and evacuation, no casualties, livelihoods with limited interruption, and a water supply and latrines that functioned afterwards.

Similar success is now repeated with Amphan. Despite the cyclone‚Äôs devastation, the people are alive and are returning home to rebuild. In Pashurbunia and Nowapara, seven kilometres of polder length were destroyed while the villages and agricultural lands were inundated.

The local population is repairing the damaged polders, houses, and latrines while restoring the drinking water supply and resuming their livelihoods. This is mainly through self-help, without much external assistance so far. It is not easy, but much better than before.

The 30 seconds video shows a motorist escaping from a landslide. The viral posts claim that the video was shot in the Guwahati-Shillong Road recently.



""Dangerous landslide on Guwahati to Shillong Highway,"" reads the caption of one such post.













Landslide at Guwahati Shillong Road Today: The theory that nature is permanently in balance has been negated by #Ecologists , now this theory is superseded by #catastrophe and #chaos theory.

A landslide is the movement of rock, earth, or debris down a sloped section of land. These can be caused by rain, earthquakes, volcanoes, or other factors that make the slope unstable.



The posts started being circulated amid reports of floods in Assam and similar incidents of Landslides in Meghalaya. According to an NDTV report, around three lakh people in 300 villages across Assam have been affected by flash floods. The death toll as of May 29 is three. Claim: Video of landslide is from a recent incident in north-east India. Fact Check: The claim is misleading. A reverse image search of the video was done by breaking the video into individual frames using InVid. This led to a video on Youtube from which the 30 second viral video clip has been taken. The video was uploaded on April 9, 2020. ""Landslide in Sukanagara-Cianjur South on April 9, 2020 (Translated To English),"" reads the caption of the video.

A keyword search based on the caption led to a report by Indonesian media outlet Tribun Jateng. It was published on April 9 2020.

The report titled, 'Video of Bukit Landslide Seconds in Cianjur, Sadly Residents Are Busy Recording Without Reminding Riders (Translated to English)' talks about a landslide in a suburb in the Indonesian province of West Java.





Another report on the same incident said that the landslide occurred on the Sukanagara highway in Indonesia, on April 9.



Further, Meghalaya Police took to Twitter to confirm that the video is not from a national highway in Meghalaya. ""A video clip of a Landslide which is being circulated on social media is from settlements of Chiangjur & Sukanagara in Indonesia, NOT from National Highway of Meghalaya. We request citizens not to share or circulate the video clip with false content or caption,"" reads the tweet.

Massive demonstrations against racism and police brutality filled some of the nation's most famous cityscapes, with tens of thousands of people marching peacefully in scenes that were more often festive than tense.

Wearing masks and urging police reform, protesters on Saturday gathered in dozens of places from coast to coast, while mourners in North Carolina waited for hours to glimpse the golden coffin carrying the body of native son George Floyd, a black man whose death at the hands of Minneapolis police has galvanised the expanding movement.

Collectively, it was perhaps the largest one-day mobilisation since Floyd died 12 days ago and came as many cities began lifting curfews that authorities imposed following initial spasms of arson, assaults and smash-and-grab raids on businesses. Authorities have softened restrictions as the number of arrests plummeted.

Demonstrations also reached four other continents, ending in clashes in two European cities.

The largest US demonstration appeared to be in Washington, where streams of protesters flooded streets that were closed to traffic.

On a hot, humid day, protesters gathered at the Capitol, on the National Mall and in neighbourhoods.

Some turned intersections into dance floors. Tents offered snacks and water. On one block, the chime of an ice cream truck competed with the rumble of a helicopter overhead.

Pamela Reynolds said she came seeking greater accountability for police.

‚ÄúThe laws are protecting them,‚Äù said the 37-year-old African American teacher. Among the changes she wants is a federal ban on police chokeholds and a requirement for officers to wear body cameras.

Many groups headed toward the White House, which was fortified with new fencing and extra security measures.

Inside the presidential mansion, their chants and cheers could be heard in waves.

President Donald Trump, who has urged authorities to crack down on unrest, had no public events.

The demonstrations extended to Trump's golf resort just outside Miami, where about 100 protesters gathered.

Elsewhere, the backdrops included some of the nation's most famous landmarks.

Peaceful marchers filed across the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and the Brooklyn Bridge in New York.

They walked the boulevards of Hollywood and the street in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, famous for country music-themed bars and restaurants.

Many wore masks ‚Äî a reminder of the danger that the protests could exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus.

Roderick Sweeney, who is black, said he was overwhelmed to see the large turnout of white protesters waving signs that said ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù as hundreds gathered near the Golden Gate Bridge.

‚ÄúWe've had discussions in our family and among friends that nothing is going to change until our white brothers and sisters voice their opinion,‚Äù said Sweeney, 49.

The large turnout of white protesters ‚Äúis sending a powerful message.‚Äù In Philadelphia and Chicago, marchers chanted, carried signs and occasionally knelt in silence. Protesters flooded the streets in a massive showing near the Philadelphia Museum of Art and its famous ‚ÄúRocky‚Äù steps, chanting ‚ÄúNo justice, no peace!‚Äù before setting off for City Hall.

A large crowd of medical workers ‚Äî many in lab coats and scrubs ‚Äî marched to Seattle's City Hall. Signs they held read, ‚ÄúNurses kneel with you, not on you‚Äù and ‚ÄúPolice violence and racism are a public health emergency.‚Äù

Atop a parking garage in downtown Atlanta, a group of black college band alumni serenaded protesters with a tuba-heavy mix of tunes. Standing within earshot, business owner Leah Aforkor Quaye said it was her first time hitting the streets.

‚ÄúThis makes people so uncomfortable, but the only way things are happening is if we make people uncomfortable,‚Äù said Quaye, who is black.

In Raeford, North Carolina, a small town near Floyd's birthplace, people lined up outside a Free Will Baptist church, waiting to enter in small groups. At a private memorial service, mourners sang along with a choir. At the front of the chapel was a large photo of Floyd and a portrait of him adorned with an angel's wings and halo.

‚ÄúIt could have been me. It could have been my brother, my father, any of my friends who are black,‚Äù said Erik Carlos of nearby Fayetteville. ‚ÄúIt made me feel very vulnerable at first.‚Äù

Protesters and their supporters in public office say they're determined to turn the extraordinary outpouring into change, notably overhauling policing policies. In Washington, Minneapolis and elsewhere, marchers urged officials to ‚Äúdefund‚Äù police ‚Äî a demand that has become more common in recent days.

Theresa Bland, 68, a retired teacher and real estate agent protesting at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus, had a broader agenda in mind.

‚ÄúI'm looking at affordable housing, political justice, prison reform, the whole ball of wax,‚Äù she said.

Some reforms already have been enacted.

Minneapolis officials have agreed to ban chokeholds and neck restraints by police and to require officers to stop other officers using improper force.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the state's police-training program to stop teaching officers a neck hold that blocks the flow of blood to the brain.

The police chief in Bellevue, a wealthy city near Seattle, largely banned officers from using neck restraints, while police in Reno, Nevada, updated their use-of-force policy.

The figure is more than double the number the 130 million who were estimated to suffer food shortages last year.

The April analysis came just before this week‚Äôs World Hunger Day, an initiative of the New York-based Hunger Project

The pandemic is expected to exacerbate an already dire situation ‚Äì 1 out of 9 people now do not have enough to eat, meaning that 820 million people face sustained hunger.

""We know this is beyond health ‚Äì it's becoming a hunger crisis and is taking an enormous toll on individuals,"" said Hunger Project spokesperson Sara Wilson.

The ""hunger pandemic"" linked to the COVID-19 outbreak is expected to be caused by economic hardship, price hikes, and substantial breaks in the food supply chain.

""There are no famines yet,‚Äù WFP Executive Director David Beasley told the U.N. Security Council. However, he said, ‚Äúwe could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months.""

The coronavirus is disrupting food supply chains because farmers and laborers cannot work or travel, transportation delays are causing shortages, and in the United States, for example, meat processing plants have been forced to close.

Not only are these breaks in the supply chain affecting the availability of food, but also its affordability. Millions who already struggled to support themselves and their families have been struck by economic hardship caused by lockdowns around the globe.

Residents wearing protective face masks hold food boxes distributed by the government during a lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19, on the outskirts of Quito, Ecuador, May 27, 2020.

With seasonal work disrupted, overseas remittances are expected to drop sharply in many countries, including Haiti, Nepal, and Somalia, said Beasley. With travel restrictions across the globe, lack of revenue from vacationers will damage countries such as Ethiopia, where tourism receipts account for 9.4 percent of gross domestic product. In countries like South Sudan, where oil accounts for 98.8 percent of total exports, collapsing oil prices will decimate the economy. As the economic crisis deepens, donations from richer nations are expected to drop, meaning fewer resources will go toward lifesaving aid, said Beasley.

Moreover, as global unemployment peaks, food prices in many countries continue to rise.

In the United States, the price of processed meat spiked 11.6 percent higher than reported from the same period last year, according to Nielsen, a global marketing research firm.

In some developing nations, the effects are even more dramatic. In Kenya, for example, the price of corn, a staple food, has risen more than 60 percent this year, according to a report by the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, a provider of information on food insecurity set up in 1985 by the U.S. Agency for International Development.

The outbreak has disproportionately hit the world‚Äôs poorest communities, those that already risk food insecurity, limited information and access to healthcare, and poor sanitation. The effects of COVID-19 on food insecurity and hunger are the highest in such Middle Eastern and African countries as Syria and Yemen, where conflict adds to the pandemic's damaging effects in areas already at risk, WFP officials say.

""In a worst-case scenario, we could be looking at famine in about three dozen countries, and in fact, in 10 of these countries, we already have more than 1 million people per country who are on the verge of starvation. In many places, this human suffering is the heavy price of conflict,"" said Beasley.

FILE - Chef Walter Ferreira pours rice into a stew at a soup kitchen in Luque, Paraguay, May 11, 2020. The number of soup kitchens in the country has increased, as the country's economy grinds down due to the new coronavirus pandemic lockdown.

For some countries, the coronavirus adds to existing food challenges.

In Pakistan, for example, a heat wave, locusts, and flooding have been forecast for the coming weeks and are expected to interfere with crops, said Jennifer Ankrom, the country director in Pakistan for Action Against Hunger.

""All of these overlapping crises are coming at a time when the ability of the global community to support relief efforts is depleted,"" she said, ""I think we will start to see reduced ability of the local civil society [in Pakistan] in the coming months especially if the number of cases continues to rise.""

Pakistan is not alone in its number of challenges during this time. Many other countries are juggling crises on top of the pandemic, including southeastern African nations, such as Zimbabwe, that have been struck by a severe drought.

As new crises emerge, officials at the WFP and other organizations advise that governments must address the COVID-19 ""new normal"" and how to carry on and face the new challenges while managing a global pandemic. The effects of COVID-19 are expected to last for a long time, and national leaders must be able to identify needs and gaps in their infrastructure and prioritize preparedness for future changes, Hunger Project officials said.

There have been some promising developments regarding food insecurity in the months since the outbreak began, such as a project supported by Heifer International in which Ecuadoran farmers deliver food to locked-down Quito families, but experts say inaction could be devastating to millions of people in the immediate future.","Thu, 28 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/afp-image/2020/05/3b6f6cb715f2f4ea3c293f21393b6e26bb29d31d.jpg,"['covid19', 'experts', 'insecurity', 'food', 'say', 'number', 'million', 'expected', 'hunger', 'risk', 'price', '265', 'puts', 'pandemic', 'countries']",

Yesterday we shared news of a fundraising campaign to support coffee communities in Northern Rwanda that were some of the hardest hit during this Spring‚Äôs historically wet rainy season, which has displaced hundreds of thousands of people in East Africa and taken the lives of hundreds.

Today comes yet another fundraising effort focusing on a coffee-growing region a few hundred kilometers north in the Kasese District in Western Uganda.

In early May, during the early part of the harvest season, the approximately 1,700-member Bukonzo Joint Cooperative Union (BJCU) in the Rwenzori mountains lost about 5 metric tons (approximately 11,000 pounds) of coffee and parchment due to flooding. The water also demolished housing and critical coffee infrastructure.

Aside from its reputation for delivering exceptional specialty coffee, the Bukonzo Joint Cooperative Union has also been recognized for its long-running and effective efforts in running a women-focused value chain framework.

According to fundraiser organizers and longtime buyers of the cooperative‚Äôs coffees Atlas Coffee Importers and Salt Spring Coffee, BJCU General Manager Baluku Paineto said $30,000 USD of short- and long-term funding are needed to get the mill operation running again.

While the united ‚ÄúFriends of BJCU‚Äù have already donated some funds, the group led by Seattle-based Atlas and Richmond, British Columbia-based Salt Spring is seeking to raise $20,000 more through a GoFundMe campaign.

However, fewer people showed up to watch the flogging than usual, presumably due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The use of the public punishment has continued despite bans on mass gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic. The couple had their temperatures checked and wore face masks while they were flogged with a cane outside a mosque, AFP reported. At one point, the man‚Äôs punishment was paused because he was in so much pain. Another official had to be pushed into finishing the heavy lashing of the woman.

""This young couple deserved a hundred lashes because they violated Islamic law,"" said Agus Kelana Putra, head of the general crime division at the prosecutor's office in the Aceh Besar district, AFP reported. Another man caught in a hotel room with an underaged girl was also whipped 40 times.

However, the floggings attracted fewer people than they normally do.

""Not so many people came because today because they've seen it many times before - or they're afraid of COVID-19,"" a local resident only identified as Faisal told AFP.

In January, the Aceh province established a new, eight-member female flogging unit to carry out public whippings against women who violate the region‚Äôs code of Sharia, or Islamic law, AFP reported at the time.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) has repeatedly demanded that the Indonesian government eradicate Sharia in Aceh, also warning that it is on the rise in Indonesia‚Äôs Aceh province.

According to HRW, more than 530 people have been publicly flogged for various violations of Sharia in Aceh since 2015, when the province‚Äôs Islamic criminal code was enacted.

Under Sharia, drinking alcohol, adultery, homosexuality, gambling and any public displays of affection between men and women outside of marriage are outlawed. Aceh is the only Indonesian province to officially enforce such a code, even though other districts across Indonesia are also implementing Sharia-influenced laws.","Fri, 05 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn1.img.sputniknews.com/images/106770/83/1067708328.jpg,"['afp', 'sex', 'flogged', 'code', 'publicly', 'indonesias', 'aceh', 'couple', 'public', 'province', 'women', 'reported', 'sharia', 'islamic', 'having', 'premarital']",

Anti-India protests have continued for a second day on Monday in Indian-administered Kashmir after the Indian forces killed at least nine rebels in the disputed region.

The rebels, including three commanders, were killed in separate gunfights with the security forces in Shopian district, some 70km (43 miles) south of the capital, Srinagar. The fighting began on Sunday.

Four rebels were killed in the Pinjora area on Monday morning after the government forces set up a cordon and search operation when they received intelligence about the presence of the fighters, who either want Kashmir‚Äôs independence or a merger with Muslim-majority Pakistan.

Five other rebels were killed in a gunfight with the forces in Shopian district‚Äôs Reban area on Sunday afternoon. Police said three soldiers were wounded.

‚ÄúNine militants of the Hizbul Mujahideen outfit, including its three top commanders, have been neutralized in less than 24 hours,‚Äù state police chief Dilbagh Singh told reporters on Monday.

Singh said the Indian security forces have eliminated 22 rebels, including six top commanders, during the past two weeks.

Police said 73 rebels have been killed in the Muslim-majority region this year.

In April alone, more than two dozen rebels and about a dozen Indian troops were killed, the most in any month since August 2019, when India revoked the region‚Äôs semi-autonomous status and statehood, and imposed direct federal rule.

The latest killings sparked protests and clashes as hundreds of residents tried to march to the site of the battle.

Chanting slogans demanding an end to India‚Äôs occupation of Kashmir, demonstrators threw stones at police and paramilitary soldiers, who fired shotgun pellets and tear gas.

No casualties were immediately reported in the clashes.

India has stepped up its operations across Kashmir in recent months, with almost daily fighting reported along the rugged and mountainous frontier that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan.

Since 1989, the conflict has resulted in nearly 70,000 deaths, most of them civilians.

India accuses Pakistan of arming and training the anti-India rebels. Pakistan denies this, saying it offers only moral and diplomatic support to the rebels and to Kashmiri civilians who oppose Indian rule.","Mon, 08 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/e2848b1fdd0e4161b9051307f6921078_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C560,"['including', 'shopian', 'forces', 'killed', 'commanders', 'protests', 'rebels', 'fresh', 'soldiers', 'kashmir', 'indian', 'kill']",

A fumbling fragmentation looks more likely than another Depression

Robert Zoellick, former World Bank president and author of ‚ÄòAmerica in the World‚Äô

The deep economic dive has shocked people. The pace and extent of recovery depends on the discovery and availability of treatments and vaccines. I suspect we will see slow revivals, episodic setbacks and costly adjustments ‚Äî but not a decade of economic disaster. Many small businesses and some storied brands will not survive, while skilful adaptors and disrupters, especially in the digital economy, will emerge stronger. I will be watching for signals of confidence from consumers, businesses, and societies.

The Depression caused more than economic pain. It metastasised to a loss of faith in democracies, the triumph of ideologies of hate, a turn to demagogues, a breakdown of international trade and finance and, ultimately, the second world war.

Robert Zoellick: 'This picture of fragmentation reveals spectres of dangers, old and new' ¬© Carla Gottgens/Bloomberg

Today, the US, the innovator and guarantor of the late 20th-century order, is recklessly deconstructing its own framework. China, which rose successfully within this supportive international system, threatens it from within while exploring an alternative design based on tributary states. Ageing Japan, fearful of China and uncertain of America‚Äôs reliability, treads cautiously. India drifts back to the diplomacy of ‚Äústrategic autonomy‚Äù. Russia manipulates for external advantage while withering internally. The EU struggles to preserve internal coherence while waking painfully to dashed dreams of a postmodernist international legal order. Britain debates with itself. Middle-weight economies struggle to calculate where they will fit within the fractious new world. Billions of people in developing countries do the best they can.

This picture of fragmentation reveals spectres of dangers, old and new. The world needs biological security and advances in biotechnology. People demand inclusive economic growth. Environmental and energy challenges loom. We are just beginning a huge digital transformation. Would-be regional hegemons still seek weapons of mass destruction and terrorists want to wreak devastation and fear. Democracies wonder about the future of freedom. The world weighs the future of China. Gloom is not, however, destiny. Crises test the resilience of nations.

A V-shaped recovery is on track

Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley‚Äôs chief investment officer

While 2020 has been an unusual year to say the least, I would argue that financial market behaviour has been quite predictable. The pandemic led to a sharp drop in the market, record unemployment and, tragically, 100,000 deaths thus far in the US. But it also prompted policymakers to respond with unprecedented support. The US Federal Reserve is now on track to expand its balance sheet by 38 per cent of gross domestic product over the next 18 months to $12tn, or twice as much as it did after the 2008 financial crisis. We project that fiscal spending plans will result in US deficits this year approaching 25 per cent of GDP, a level not witnessed since the second world war.

Though Covid-19 came out of the blue, recessions are never caused by a single event. Instead, they are the result of excesses that have built up in the real economy. With the prior expansion lasting a record 10 years, there were plenty of excesses by the time 2020 rolled around. The pandemic was just the trigger for a recession that was already approaching. In fact, markets had already been trading defensively for years, with most individual stocks in a bear market. As usual, when the downturn finally arrived, the bear market ended with a sell-off in March.

Historically, economies frequently experience a V-shaped recovery after a recession. The severity of this particular recession, combined with the unprecedented policy response, makes it unlikely we will see anything but a V-shaped recovery this time. Equity markets thus have recovered appropriately, with the S&P 500 up 35 per cent from its March lows. In fact, on many metrics we track, the market recovery looks almost identical to what happened after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Just as in 2009, most investors naturally remain very sceptical.

It appears that the US economy is reopening without significant increases in Covid-19 cases. This is encouraging and if cases do rise again in a second wave, the healthcare system should be better prepared to respond, making another lockdown less likely. Such an outcome should mean the unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus boosts the economy rather than just making up for lost ground. With this framework and the past as prologue, we expect the rally to continue and broaden out to the more cyclical parts of the equity market, where valuations remain inexpensive.

Without a global recovery plan, demand will stagnate and inequality will increase

Mariana Mazzucato, professor and director of the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, University College London

Covid-19 has brought economies to their knees. The question is how long and how severe the resulting recession will be. The answer depends on the quality and quantity of global stimulus packages. To work, they must address both demand and supply, delivering income to the most vulnerable through well-structured universal basic income policies or national job guarantee schemes, and assistance to companies to get back on their feet as well as providing a bold, green direction for investment.

Economic growth will also depend heavily on the speed at which we can find a vaccine, manufacture it at scale and make it globally accessible. The World Health Organization initiative to ensure worldwide sharing of all Covid-19-related knowledge, data and technologies by making a pool of Covid-19 patent licences freely available to all countries is a great move in this direction. The virus can only be defeated with truly collective intelligence.

In developed economies such as Japan, the EU and the UK, government stimulus has been large but mainly reactive and the same levels have not been matched elsewhere, especially in developing countries. Given the global nature of the economy, without a truly global recovery plan, demand will stagnate. Even worse, inequality, which has made the crisis worse than it had to be, will only increase.

While assisting citizens and businesses is the right thing to do, the structure of that aid matters. Loans and mortgage holidays, which only delay interest payments, risk increasing private debt, already at record levels. True debt relief for the most vulnerable individuals and families could avoid this. We need policies that are not only reactive but also strategic, bringing us closer to an investment-led global Green New Deal. Bold plans to create carbon-neutral cities and regions could foster creativity and innovation ‚Äî especially now that many have rediscovered the joys of walking and biking. Social, organisational and technological innovation could help change how we eat, how we move, and how we build, spurring a green transformation. Conditions attached to bailouts of the most polluting industries, from steel to airlines, can make this happen quicker.

Let‚Äôs remember 2020 as the year we rediscovered the need for strong global health systems and the world avoided a new Depression with a Green New Deal and an investment-led recovery.

Expect Europe‚Äôs biggest peacetime recession in nearly 100 years

Erik Nielsen, UniCredit‚Äôs chief global economist

Attempting to forecast the economic effects of the lockdown is truly a fool‚Äôs game. Never before have we seen a man-made recession of this scale, nor have we seen policy responses of this magnitude to cushion the impact on people‚Äôs livelihood. On balance, however, I expect the biggest peacetime recession in almost 100 years.

The initial collapse in economic activity appears to be coming to an end. Depending on the severity of the lockdown in individual countries, preliminary indicators suggest that we are now some 15 to 30 per cent below GDP levels at the beginning of the year. Southern Europe and France have suffered most; northern and central Europe somewhat less ‚Äî and countries such as Russia and Turkey still less so far, as the virus spread there later.

The next three months will see an easing of lockdowns throughout western Europe, first leading to a stabilisation of activity ‚Äî at very depressed levels ‚Äî followed by some growth and areas of strong rebound. The biggest risk is a flare-up of new infections as rules are eased, and another round of lockdowns. This would then change the base case of a ‚ÄúNike logo-shaped‚Äù GDP growth trajectory into a ‚ÄúW-shaped‚Äù one. Following the bounce off a deep trough, I expect a long, gradual recovery as we learn to live with the virus. Until an effective vaccine becomes widely available it is difficult to imagine a return to normality or to pre-crisis GDP levels.

In aggregate, I expect eurozone GDP to contract by about 13 per cent this year. Even though 2021 will probably see impressive growth rates, the GDP level at the end of next year will still be some 4 per cent below the pre-crisis level. Central Europe will probably suffer slightly less and pre-crisis GDP levels could be broadly restored by the end of 2021. While Turkish and Russian GDP will drop by about 5.5 per cent this year, assuming the external financing picture does not deteriorate further, Turkey will probably bounce back stronger in 2021, while Russia will take considerably longer. Once we are through the crisis, I suspect we will have suffered a GDP drop on the same scale as during the 1930s, but followed by a faster and more robust recovery.

For Asia, at least, this is not the Depression

Trinh Nguyen, senior economist for emerging Asia at Natixis

Economic data is frightful right now ‚Äî from retail sales to exports, growth engines are sputtering sharply. After a supply shock from China‚Äôs factory closures in February, Asia is confronting both domestic and external demand shocks in the second quarter. Mobility restrictions, especially in economies dependent on domestic demand such as India, Indonesia and the Philippines, have suppressed already shy spenders. Even in countries with ‚Äúnormalised‚Äù mobility, self-restraint has left shopkeepers wanting. Missing tourists, falling export sales, weakening remittances and cautious foreign investors have put income pressure on current account deficit economies, and even excess-saving ones such as China, Singapore and Thailand.

It is easy to feel depressed. Asia‚Äôs GDP contracted in the first quarter, led by China‚Äôs sharp fall, and Q2 will be worse as many economies extend lockdowns. China scrapping its GDP target means we should not count on the country to stimulate regional demand. At the same time, Asia‚Äôs high dependency on small and medium-sized enterprises for employment will probably result in worse labour market conditions and therefore purchasing power.

After a slow start, some Asian economies are stepping up support. India increased fiscal support by 2.7 per cent of GDP with funds for lower-income households. The Philippines is proposing an additional $26bn stimulus. Indonesia is adding $43bn to soften the impact on SMEs. South Korea‚Äôs New Deal will create jobs and foster industries such as 5G and artificial intelligence.

Beyond rate cuts, Asian central banks have done more to ease liquidity shocks, from Bank Indonesia buying government bonds to the Bank of Thailand creating a corporate bond fund. The US Fed has flooded all markets with dollar liquidity through repo and swap lines.

While regional growth will probably contract in 2020, worse than the 1997 Asian financial crisis, this is not the beginning of another Depression. Asia‚Äôs flexible response, such as allowing foreign exchange rates to absorb shocks, will stabilise funding conditions. Economies with current account deficits are likely to require less external funding as import demand falls.

I expect the region to recover in 2021. Worsening demographics and risingdebt as well as deglobalisation are key risks but also opportunities. Companies looking for diversification, growth and lower prices will be attracted to India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. The growing need for infrastructure in countries with demographic booms will attract foreign investors.

It could be the 1930s all over again for Latin America

Andr√©s Velasco, dean of the school of public policy at the London School of Economics

During the Depression, Latin America was buffeted by a collapse in commodity prices, a slowdown in world trade and a massive capital outflow. The same shocks are hitting the region today, but this time one has to add a decline in remittances (crucial for Central America and the Caribbean) and a productivity freeze, due to having much of the labour force under lockdown.

Back then, the economic contraction was brutal. Between 1929 and 1933, output fell by 10 per cent in Argentina and Mexico and by an eye-popping 37 per cent in Chile. Brazil and Colombia also suffered sharp initial drops, but by 1933 had recovered pre-Depression income levels. In the era of Covid-19, Latin America is well on its way to replicating that dismal performance. Back in mid-April the IMF predicted the region‚Äôs economy would shrink by 5.2 per cent in 2020 alone, with particularly sharp drops of 6.6 per cent in Mexico and 5.7 per cent in Argentina. Those forecasts are already outdated. Actual 2020 contractions will probably be much larger.

In the alphabet soup of alternative economic paths, a V-shaped recovery for Latin America looks farfetched ‚Äî unless, that is, a vaccine arrives quickly and, with it, a worldwide resumption of growth. The virus came late to the region and some countries ‚Äî Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico ‚Äî have been remarkably inept at containing it. In others, high public debt and spotty access to international capital limit what governments can do to counteract the effects of the pandemic. Only Chile and Peru have the fiscal space to finance aggressive containment policies. Even there, new cases of contagion and Covid-19-related deaths are up sharply in the past two weeks.

Under the Inter-American Development Bank‚Äôs mildest scenario, Latin America‚Äôs economy contracts by 6.3 per cent in 2020-22. In the most extreme case, the cumulative contraction reaches 14.4 per cent ‚Äî not too different from what the region experienced in the Depression.

In the 1930s, the countries that recovered quickly were those, mostly in South America, that adopted unorthodox measures. They cut interest rates and allowed their currencies to depreciate after leaving the gold standard. Most also defaulted on their foreign debts ‚Äî except in the Caribbean, where platoons of US Marines guaranteed repayment.

Today, flexible exchange rates are the new orthodoxy, so that is not a constraint. But availability of dollar finance is. Unless institutions such as the IMF and the IADB sharply step up their lending, a new wave of debt defaults could make it the 1930s all over again.","Tue, 02 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F0573aedc-a501-11ea-a27c-b8aa85e36b7e?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900,"['free', 'read', 'recovery', 'depression', 'cent', 'growth', 'economies', 'gdp', 'global', 'world', 'market', 'demand', 'heading', 'countries']",

In the MRN office, Vladimir Moreira lists the socio-environmental measures taken by the company to mitigate the mine‚Äôs impacts. These include income generation schemes and better health and education services. ‚ÄúPerhaps the thing I‚Äôm proudest of is the fact that children from the quilombola communities go to the same school as the children of mine employees,‚Äù he says. It makes a big beneficial difference, he adds, as the quilombola communities don‚Äôt have secondary schools.

But many locals attending the mine‚Äôs school are ambivalent. Carlene Printes, now at university in Bel√©m, says her earlier school years were ‚Äúthe most difficult period in my life.‚Äù Printes was the target of racist jokes as adolescents whose parents worked for the mine scoffed at the shape of her nose and kinky hair. ‚ÄúWhat was most painful of all was that the teachers and coordinators made out that I was making a fuss about nothing. Nobody did anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúToday, I wonder if the price we paid for this quality education was too great,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to fish. I‚Äôm 31 years old and, if you gave me a fishing rod, I wouldn‚Äôt know what to do with it. I don‚Äôt know how to grow vegetables or hunt because the company took all this away from us. And we don‚Äôt have enough land to do any of this, in any case.‚Äù

And what of the future?

As many in the community depend today on jobs linked to MRN, the anthropologist L√∫cia Andrade, from the Comiss√£o Pro-√çndio, is worried about what will happen when the mineral reserves run out. ‚ÄúMRN is [presently] carrying out a series of socio-environmental programs with the [local] population but, until now, I don‚Äôt see a consistent discussion or measures that answer this question: what will the future of the community be like when these jobs disappear?‚Äù

It may be some time before that happens. According to MRN, existing mines won‚Äôt be exhausted until 2025, at which point five more already licensed bauxite sites can take over, producing for two decades; after which other new areas could be opened. Though all of this optimism hinges on a global community hungry for aluminum, demand that could steeply decline if COVID-19 triggers a global economic depression.

Whatever happens, the mining company seems unlikely to have it all its own way. In recent years, local communities have won some rights. For instance, Brazil signed the International Labour Organisation‚Äôs Convention 169, which requires ‚Äúprior, free and informed‚Äù consultation with indigenous and traditional communities likely to suffer a major impact from a big new infrastructure project ‚Äî though Brazil reportedly sidestepped this agreement for the Belo Monte mega-dam and other projects.

Boa Vista was also the first quilombola community in the country to obtain a collective land title, a right established by the progressive 1988 Constitution. Today, five quilombola territories in Oriximin√° municipality have won definitive land rights, and others are fighting for recognition. However, many experts are concerned over possible setbacks by the Jair Bolsonaro government.

The quilombola story is remarkable: starting in the middle of the 18th century, runaway slaves began settling along the Trombetas River as part of a region-wide movement that was fracturing the slave-based structure in Par√° state.

‚ÄúMy grandparents and great-grandparents were slaves,‚Äù says Jos√© dos Santos. ‚ÄúThey fled from plantations in Santar√©m [an Amazon River port] and came up the Trombetas River to hide.‚Äù According to historian Eur√≠pedes Funes, the runaways began to feel safe once they crossed a stretch of river known for its impassable rapids, which acted as a natural barrier to the punitive expeditions sent to recapture them.

Although there were conflicts, former slaves learned to coexist with indigenous groups, the region‚Äôs original inhabitants, acquiring from them essential knowledge about living in the forest and utilizing natural wealth to live sustainably.

Even before slavery ended in 1888, the runaways‚Äô descendants began moving downstream to more navigable stretches of the river. Still, life remained far from easy, particularly during the military dictatorship (1964-1985) when the government encouraged mining companies, like MRN, to move in. The quilombos were simply ignored and community lands taken over.

Lapses in energy and sanitation

Today, Porto Trombetas and Boa Vista are two very different worlds. The company town has electric lights, supermarkets, banks, schools that teach English, restaurants, clubs, gyms and an airport. A half mile away, Boa Vista is made up of rough wooden houses often crammed together and built beside dirt tracks; the village lacks basic sanitation. Running water was only installed last year.

Mongabay‚Äôs two-hour interview with coordinator dos Santos was frequently interrupted by people complaining of no electricity because the community generator had broken down. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been suffering for 40 years and they still haven‚Äôt bothered to extend the electricity system from Porto Trombetas to here. And it‚Äôs so close,‚Äù he grumbled.

When questioned about this, mine spokesperson Moreira, said that the community complaints weren‚Äôt the mining company‚Äôs responsibility, but that of the municipal government. ‚ÄúThe real question is: how do we get public powers involved? The mining company isn‚Äôt, and shouldn‚Äôt be, a substitute for the State,‚Äù he said. Mongabay tried repeatedly to talk to Oriximin√°‚Äôs mayor, but he ignored our requests for comment.

In 2019, the municipality, which has 73,000 inhabitants, received almost R$37 million (US$6.5 million) in Financial Compensation for Mineral Resource Exploitation (CFEM), a tax mining companies pay to federal, state and municipal authorities. Even though Oriximin√° has been receiving these payments since 1992, it continues to suffer from a low level of development, according to the last official census in 2010. While the nation had an average per capita income of US$136 then, people in Oriximin√° earned an average of just US$56* ‚Äî less than half Brazil‚Äôs average.

Waiting for the much-promised progress that never seems to arrive, Amarildo studies a huge ocean-going ore ship docked at the port, then comments sadly: ‚ÄúThis development, we only see it pass by. It only goes to the company.‚Äù

On the verge of tears, he expresses his fears: ‚ÄúI look at my young son and I think, ‚Äòsoon I‚Äôll pass on and what will you do with destroyed land and a destroyed river?‚Äô It‚Äôs painful for me to see that the Boa Vista community hasn‚Äôt a lake where it can fish, nor land where it can hunt, and it‚Äôs being invaded on all sides by the company.‚Äù

It is now doing so in the Brazilian Amazon where the virus killed nine Munduruku indigenous elders in just a few days. Forest people elders are typically leaders and keepers of culture, so their loss is especially destabilizing.

Officially, 218 indigenous people had died of COVID-19 and 2,642 were infected as of 7 June. But experts say that the numbers are at least three times higher, with poor government recordkeeping and Amazon community remoteness resulting in a severe undercount.

The Munduruku, Kokama, and Xavante groups are already seeing cases, with the virus now threatening Brazil‚Äôs two largest indigenous territories: Yanomami Park and Javari Valley Indigenous Territory. These two reserves are home to most of Brazil‚Äôs uncontacted peoples. COVID-19 spread there would be a disaster.

Indigenous groups are pursuing independent efforts, such as setting up COVID-19 communication websites, to protect their communities. In response to what they call government inaction, indifference and blundering, advocates remind the Brazilian government and the world that ‚Äúindigenous lives matter.‚Äù

Alessandra Korap‚Äôs voice breaks when she lists five Munduruku indigenous elders living along the Tapaj√≥s River, a tributary of the Amazon. Between 9 May and 2 June, Ang√©lico Yori (aged 76), Raimundo Dace (70), Jer√¥nimo Manhuary (86), Vicente Saw Munduruku (71), and Am√¢ncio Ikon Munduruku (59) died ‚Äî all victims of COVID-19.

Since then another four have passed, including Acelino Dace (77). The loss in a matter of days of nine elders ‚Äî leaders and keepers of the Munduruku culture ‚Äî is a huge blow for a people only numbering around 14,000.

Am√¢ncio Ikon Munduruku was a teacher and respected leader. He played a vital role in the Munduruku‚Äôs momentous decision ‚Äî in the face of decades of delay by Brazil‚Äôs government ‚Äî to mark out the boundaries of their own territory beside the Tapaj√≥s River. This show of indigenous strength was crucial in the government‚Äôs 2016 decision to abandon plans to build the S√£o Luiz do Tapaj√≥s hydroelectric mega-dam, which would have flooded part of the now fully measured Munduruku territory.

While grieving the loss of dearly loved elders, the Munduruku are now also coping with the irreparable loss to their culture. ‚ÄúEvery time an elder dies, a library is burnt,‚Äù Bruna Rocha, a lecturer in archaeology at the Federal University of Western Par√°, tells Mongabay. She is quoting Amadou Hampat√© B√¢, a renowned intellectual from Mali in Africa, but she says, the quote applies equally to the traditional people of the Amazon forest, whether indigenous, riverine or quilombolas (descendants of run-away slaves).

‚ÄúBesides being knowledge repositories on the environment, history, territory, production of specific artefacts and medicines, these elders provide political and spiritual guidance, being fundamental in the struggle for territorial recognition. They remind their peoples of who they are in a fast-changing world,‚Äù Rocha says. ‚ÄúThe sudden death of a number of elders from the same community could be compared to torching national museums, libraries and parliaments all at the same time.‚Äù

COVID-19 killing the most vulnerable

Fiona Watson, from Survival International, an NGO that works with indigenous peoples, told Mongabay that COVID-19 is awakening painful memories: ‚ÄúMany elders recall vividly the devastating epidemics spread by government indigenous agencies and land grabbers, loggers, ranchers, and miners in the 1970s and 1980s,‚Äù during Brazil‚Äôs military dictatorship. ‚ÄúIt was not uncommon [then] for 50%, even 90%. of a tribe to be wiped out within the first year of contact.‚Äù

A particularly tragic case: the Matis, living in the Javari River Valley in the far western Amazon basin, in Amazonas state near the frontier with Peru. Numbering several hundred when first contacted in the late 1970s, their population fell to just 87 by 1983, as waves of epidemics raged through their isolated villages, killing mainly old people and children.

The consequences of the current pandemic may not be as serious because its overall mortality rate (now at around 1%) does not seem as high, but that estimate remains uncertain ‚Äî no one yet knows how this pandemic will impact different ethnic and racial groups, not to mention its impact in remote settlements almost completely without modern health facilities.

However, according to evidence collected so far, COVID-19 may be far more dangerous for indigenous and black Brazilians than for white Brazilians. One study by Fiocruz, the health ministry‚Äôs internationally renowned institute of health science and technology, suggests that the death rate among hospitalized Indians is 48% compared with 28% for whites, 36% for black Brazilians and 40% for Brazilians of mixed race.

L√∫cia Andrade, from the NGO, Comiss√£o Pro-Indio, believes that ‚Äî as around the world ‚Äî poor and disempowered groups are being disproportionately affected. ‚ÄúThere is a race, ethnicity and social class bias in the tragic deaths from the pandemic,‚Äù she told Mongabay.

As the pandemic spreads, authorities seem to dither

At this point, it is impossible to accurately gauge just how rapidly COVID-19 is spreading among indigenous groups, says Angela Kaxuyana, a member of the executive council of COIAB (the Coordination of Indigenous Organizations in the Brazilian Amazon), active in the Amazon region‚Äôs nine states.

According to APIB (Association of Indigenous People in Brazil), a network of indigenous organisations, 218 indigenous people had died and 2,642 had been infected by 7 June. But, she says, widespread under-reporting, due the remoteness of many territories, and frequent misdiagnosis mean that the real situation may be much worse. ‚ÄúWe fear that the real figure for infections may be at least three times greater,‚Äù she told Mongabay.

Angela berates the response from authorities: ‚ÄúThe government is only beginning to take action [in the Amazon] and what they are doing is quite inadequate.‚Äù

She warns: ‚ÄúIf we go on at this rate, some indigenous peoples will be wiped out.‚Äù

Some peoples are being more seriously affected than others. Like the Munduruku, the Kokama, who live along the Solim√µes River, where Brazil, Peru and Colombia meet, are reeling from the pandemic‚Äôs impact. The Kokama were the first people to have a confirmed COVID-19 death in an indigenous village ‚Äî now at least 51 of their people have died from the disease.

Kokama leaders warned authorities they were particularly vulnerable because of the large number of people coming and going on the frontier region. Yet, they say, few measures were taken: ‚ÄúWe are afflicted and desperate‚Ä¶ and indignant at the negligence, disregard and omission of public powers at the federal, state and municipal levels.‚Äù

The Xavante people in the Mar√£iwats√©de Indigenous Territory in eastern Mato Grosso state believes authorities have put them at risk due to official blunders. On 28 May health officials purposely returned a COVID-19 infected man back to Mar√£iwats√©de village. He was told to live in ‚Äúdomestic isolation,‚Äù although this is virtually impossible in a settlement where 30 people or more of all ages live together in small houses. Cultural Survival, an NGO working with indigenous people, dubbed this action, ‚Äúa genocidal move that exposes an entire A‚ÄôuweÃÉ-Xavante community to COVID-19.‚Äù

Pandemic poised at Yanomami Park and Javari Valley

The coronavirus has also reached Brazil‚Äôs two largest reserves ‚Äî the Yanomami Indigenous Territory (9.6 million hectares/37,000 square miles) in Roraima and Amazonas states, and the Javari Valley Indigenous Territory (8.5 million hectares/32,800 square miles) in Amazonas state. Those two territories are home to most of Brazil‚Äôs isolated and uncontacted Indians.

The Yanomami Territory is under severe threat due to the presence of some 20,000 wildcat gold miners. APIB says six Yanomami have already died of the virus and dozens more are infected ‚Äî but far worse is expected.

The Yanomami are ‚Äúthe most vulnerable people in the whole of the Brazilian Amazon to the pandemic,‚Äù according to a recent study produced jointly by the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) and the Socioenvironmental Institute (ISA), an NGO. The study predicts in a worst case scenario that, if urgent action is not taken, 40% of the almost 14,000 Yanomami living less than five kilometers from the miners‚Äô illegal settlements could be infected. While it is difficult to make accurate predictions, given the scant knowledge about indigenous vulnerability to the disease, the study predicts that in this case between 207 and 896 Yanomami could die, making this group one of the world‚Äôs worst affected indigenous communities.

The Yanomami are mobilizing to prevent this outcome, if possible. According to Dario Yanomami, from the Hutukara Yanomami Association: ‚ÄúOur shamans are working non-stop to counter this xawara (epidemic). We will fight and resist.‚Äù The Yanomami have organized a campaign, supported by various national and international organizations, including ISA and Survival International, called ForaGarimpoForaCovid (MinersOutCovidOut). It aims to put pressure on the Brazilian authorities to expel the illegal miners. However, critics wonder if the Bolsonaro government, with its continued denial of the pandemic and its anti-indigenous stance, will respond.

The Javari Valley Indigenous Territory is also under enormous threat, though reporting from there is much harder to obtain because many indigenous people live in isolated groups fleeing contact with the outside world. Fears are that the virus will spread to those groups via the sporadic contacts they maintain with neighbouring groups.

On 7 June it was reported that seven Indians and four health agents in the Javari Valley had been infected with the virus. The Union of the Indigenous Peoples of Javari River Valley (UNIVAJA) has sent out an SOS, urgently calling for help from the government and non-governmental organizations.

‚ÄúNow that the virus has reached our community, we are afraid of genocide in the Javari River Valley. We will be counting bodies,‚Äù said Eli√©sio Marubo, a lawyer with the Union of the Indigenous Peoples of Javari River Valley (UNIVAJA).

Other indigenous peoples seriously at risk are those living in the remote Tumucumaque Park, located in Brazil‚Äôs far north in Amap√° and Par√° states, a reserve covering 1.7 million hectares (6,563 square miles). Six ethnicities inhabit the park ‚Äî the Aparai, Kaxuyana, Tiriy√≥ and Wayana, along with two groups of isolated, uncontacted Indians.

According to Angela Kaxuyana, COIAB has worked with the indigenous villages there to help prevent COVID-19 reaching the territory, but the park is located near the Surinam frontier and there is a military post within the territory. ‚ÄúSoldiers travelled to this post, without being tested for the virus and without protective equipment,‚Äù she fumes. ‚ÄúThey brought in COVID-19.‚Äù

Kaxuyana, who comes from the region, says that at least 23 indigenous people are infected already, including a pregnant woman, who has been hospitalized in serious condition. According to her, the first two indigenous cases involved Indians employed by a cleaning company that works for the Air Force running the military base.

Kaxuyana notes that a tiny medical team is trying to deal with the developing crisis. ‚ÄúIn practice, the military have abandoned the Indians to their fate. This is criminal activity by the state and they must be held to account,‚Äù she says. Kaxuyana is worried that the pandemic will spread further, as those in the affected village have had contact with neighboring villagers.

The Defense Ministry told the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper that ‚Äúit is not possible to be sure where the contagion in the region came from, but it is very unlikely to have been transmitted by soldiers working for the Brazilian Air Force.‚Äù Another version of the story concerning COVID-19‚Äôs arrival says that traveling indigenous people were infected while away from the community, and brought the virus back to the Park later.

Quilombolas and riverine communities also hit

As with indigenous reserves, it is difficult to determine the impact of COVID-19 among the quilombos (the land occupied by traditional communities originally set up by runaway slaves), because they have long been neglected by authorities and there is little official record keeping.

‚ÄúWe are invisible,‚Äù says Gilv√¢nia Maria da Silva, the co-ordinator of CONAQ (Black, Rural, Quilombola Communities). Because the state has been very slow in recognizing quilombola territories, official statistics have persistently underestimated populations in these communities. Likewise, authorities often fail to register that a person is a quilombola on a death certificate.

To combat what they call ‚Äúthe invisibility of the illness in quilombola territories,‚Äù ISA recently joined forces with CONAQ, to set up a new website, called Quilombo sem Covid-19, which registers confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. So far, the site has registered 353 confirmed cases and 59 deaths, though these numbers are thought to fall well short of the true figures.

Hundreds of thousands of often small Amazon riverine communities are also at risk. What affects them most is the chronic failure by authorities to provide public health and other services. The small communities of Montanha and Mangabal on the Tapaj√≥s River are a case in point. Although no definitive tests have been carried out there, COVID-19 is believed to have reached the settlements via a bus driver, who, without tests or protective equipment, was plying the route between the city of Itaituba (population 101,000) and the community.

Ageu Lobo Pereira, the President of the Association of Montanha and Mangabal Communities, told Mongabay that residents see themselves as forgotten ‚Äúparticularly with respect to health and education.‚Äù As if to underline that point, Seu Fil√≥, one of the community‚Äôs greatest authorities on the local Amazon forest, died on 5 June, not from COVID-19, but from a stroke, which some in the community believe could have been avoided if he had been treated properly for high blood pressure. As elsewhere, COVID-19 detracts from the treatment of other health disorders.

Bruna Rocha calls this is a critical moment: ‚ÄúWe can only hope that the overwhelming grief they feel will spur surviving forest peoples on to fight for their rights, to honor the memory of those who have gone,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe must stand by them in every way possible after the pandemic has passed, whenever that is. But until then, all efforts must be geared to saving lives ‚Äî in spite of the federal government. Indigenous lives matter.‚Äù

Abdelmalek Droukdel pictured in Mali in 2010

PARIS - French forces have killed the leader of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Algerian Abdelmalek Droukdel, in northern Mali, French officials said Friday.

Droukdel was killed on Thursday near the Algerian border, where the group has bases it uses to carry out attacks and abductions of westerners in the sub-Saharan Sahel zone, French Defence Minister Florence Parly said.

""Many close associates"" of Droukdel -- who also held authority over several affiliate jihadist groups in the region -- were also ""neutralised"", she added.

Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) stems from a group started in the late 1990s by radical Algerian Islamists.

France also claimed on Friday to have captured a leader of the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (EIGS) group, which carries out frequent attacks over Niger's western borders.

""On May 19, French forces captured Mohamed el Mrabat, veteran jihadist in the Sahel region and an important cadre in EIGS"", Parly said on Twitter.

Operations against EIGS ""the other great terrorist threat in the region"" are continuing, said Parly.

France has over 5,000 troops deployed in its anti-jihadist Barkhane force in the Sahel region.

Mali is struggling to contain an Islamist insurgency that erupted in 2012 and which has claimed thousands of military and civilian lives since.

Despite the presence of thousands of French and UN troops, the conflict has engulfed the centre of the country and spread to neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.

A source told AFP that some 500 jihadist fighters had been killed or captured by French troops in the region in recent months, including several important figures including commanders and recruiters.

Droukdel's death is a symbolic coup for the French, a military source said.

He had remained a threat in the region, capable of financing jihadist movements ,even though his leadership had been contested, the source added.

His death, and that of other Al Qaeda figures, could leave the group disorganised in the Sahel.

Born in 1971 in a poor neighbourhood of Algiers, Droukdel took part in the founding in Algeria of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC).

Abdelaziz Bouteflika, elected Algerian president in 1999, managed to convince most of the armed groups in the country to lay down their weapons.

The GSPC, however, refused to do so and Droukdel decided to approach Al -Qaeda.

His affiliation with Al-Qaeda's founder Osama bin Laden was confirmed in 2006.

The following year GSPC was renamed as AQIM, ascribing fully to Al-Qaeda's ideology.","Sat, 06 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20200606/c1_3654044_700.jpg,"['french', 'droukdel', 'captured', 'forces', 'leader', 'alqaeda', 'group', 'source', 'maghreb', 'region', 'jihadist', 'algerian', 'troops', 'islamic', 'kill']",
