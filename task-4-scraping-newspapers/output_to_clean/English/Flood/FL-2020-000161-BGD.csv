0,0,FL-2020-000161-BGD,Millions at risk in Bangladesh as monsoon floods add to coronavirus worries - Reuters India,https://www.reuters.com/article/bangladesh-floods-idINKBN242606,"DHAKA (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh have been marooned and thousands of hectares of farmland submerged, officials said on Wednesday, as floods triggered by monsoon rains ravage the country already grappling with the coronavirus.

Officials said the flooding in Bangladesh was made worse by heavy rains in the neighbouring Indian state of Assam. Millions have been forced to flee their homes in Assam after the Brahmaputra river that flows from Tibet into India and then into Bangladesh burst its banks in Assam over the weekend here, inundating more than 2,000 villages.

“Rainfalls and runoff from northern India have caused some of the rivers across Bangladesh to rise over 70 cm (30 inches) above dangerous levels,” said Jyoti Prasad Ghosh, an official at the Bangladesh Water Development Board. “The floods could worsen further in the coming days if rains continue in Assam.”

One disaster management official in Bangladesh who declined to be named said the crisis was expected to worsen in the coming days and more than 200,000 people marooned are at risk.

“The disaster is worsening by the hour, with several hundred thousands already severely affected by the floods, worsening the COVID pandemic and crisis in the country,” said Antony Balmain, a spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

Bangladesh had 149,258 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Wednesday, with 1,888 deaths.

The floods threaten about 4.1 million people, Balmain said. “Around 16,500 people most at risk are being assisted immediately with evacuation, and while thousands more will be helped in the coming days.”

The double whammy is pushing many to the brink.

In Bangladesh’s northern district of Jamalpur, farmer Mohammad Manik had been earning a living selling vegetables. He said he had to stop that due to the coronavirus lockdown.

“Now all my vegetables are under the floodwater.” Manik told Reuters. “I don’t know how to survive anymore. It’s one disaster after another.”","Wed, 01 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",,"['worries', 'add', 'vegetables', 'millions', 'thousands', 'coronavirus', 'worsen', 'rains', 'worsening', 'monsoon', 'assam', 'risk', 'floods', 'bangladesh', 'disaster', 'coming']",

In Jamalpur, over 100,000 people of at least 53 villages in four upazilas of the district have been marooned in areas submerged in the recent floods. The situation is deteriorating day by day

Thousands of people in seven districts of the country are marooned with their homes and land submerged in the recent floods.

Flooding, with water pouring down from the adjacent hills has hit the northernmost areas of the country the hardest. While in some districts the water level is receding, the threat of severe erosion has struck fear among people in the flood-hit areas.

Although local administrations say they are providing shelter and help, locals say they spend their nights under the open sky clinging to whatever little belongings they could save from the swelling rivers.

In Kurigram, the Brahmaputra, Teesta, Dharla and Dudhkumar rivers swelled further on Monday with the onrush of water from the hills and the incessant rainfall of the last few days.

The Bangladesh Water Development Board said the Dharla River was 73 cm above danger level. The Brahmaputra went up 73 cm at Chilmari point, while the Teesta has still not crossed the danger level in the last 24 hours.

Contacted, the Department of Disaster Management, Kurigram branch, said around 302 tons of rice and Tk36,50,000 have been allocated to help people in flood-hit areas.

Deputy Commissioner of the district, Md Rejaul Karim, said: “We took all necessary measures to ensure the safety and health of the people. The local administration is ready to tackle the disaster.”

In Jamalpur, over 100,000 people of at least 53 villages in four upazilas of the district have been marooned in areas submerged in the recent floods. The situation is deteriorating day by day.

The flooding in the four upazilas - Islampur, Dewanganj, Bakshiganj and Melandah - is worsening due to continuous rainfall and water from upstream which is overflowing across the banks of the Jamuna and Brahmaputra.

Till Sunday 11pm, almost 1,00,000 people of 15,224 families, in 53 villages of 13 unions under the four upazilas, have been suffering from water-logging.

District Relief and Rehabilitation Officer Nayeb Ali confirmed the matter.

Houses in Kurigram submerged in the flood on Monday, June 29, 2020 | Dhaka TribuneIn Bogra, the Jamuna river has been flowing 64cm above the danger level submerging at least 476 acres of cropland and waterlogging thousands of people in Sarikandi upazila, confirmed Foyez Ahmed, DC of the district.

At least 400 families in 10 villages of the upazila were marooned till the filing of this report on Monday 3pm, said BWDB local sources.

“We are making a list of the affected people and we will surely ensure necessary relief supplies for them,” said UNO Rasel Miah.

In Gaibandha, close to 18,000 people in 18 unions of Sadar, Fulchhari and Saghata upazilas have lost their homes to the Brahmaputra, Teesta and Ghahgat rivers crossing the district which swelled 80cm to 53cm above the danger level on Monday.

The 50 flood shelters there could hold only 2,077 people while the rest of the people had to shelter under the open sky, local sources said.

Meanwhile, over 3,500 hectares of croplands are under water, a huge loss to total crop production in the district and several areas are under threat of erosion in the respective areas, said Masudur Rahman, deputy director of the local Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE).

“We are ready to shelter and help affected people. Additional policemen and volunteers have been deployed in the area to better manage the situation,” said Abdul Matin, DC of the district.

In Sylhet and Nilphamari, the waters of the Surma, Kushiyara and Teesta rivers have been receding on Monday after showing a decrease till Sunday midnight, confirmed BWDB sources.

However, the fear of severe erosion is threatening the riverbanks of Kanaighat’s several unions, said UNO Md Bariul Karim Khan, quoting BWDB officials.

Situation may worsen over next 4-5 days, forecasts FFWC

With the monsoon setting in and onrush of hilly water from the upstream, Bangladesh is currently facing a serious threat of floods that could cause extensive damage to farmlands across the country, officials have said.

Heavy precipitation and onrush of water from hilly areas upstream have already inundated districts in the northern and eastern regions of the country.

Low lying and char areas and crop fields in Kurigram, Gaibandha, Bogra, Sylhet, Sunamganj, Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari, and Jamalpur, have gone under water while thousands of people have been left marooned.

Under these circumstances, people are enduring a lot of hardship with the added fear of coronavirus infection.

In other parts of the north, water levels in some major rivers, including the Teesta and the Dharla, have risen due to heavy rainfall in the last few days, inundating many areas in Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari, Gaibandha and Kurigram districts, according to the Flood forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC).

Moreover, the Met Office predicted that rainfall will increase across the country in the next two to three days, only to worsen the flood situation.

Md Arifuzzaman Bhuyan, executive engineer of FFWC, told Dhaka Tribune that the flooding may last for the next two weeks as water levels are likely to rise this week and perhaps start to recede from next week.

He said the flooding may spread to some central districts like Faridpur, Madaripur, Shariatpur, Rajbari, and Munshiganj in a couple of days, as water levels continue to rise in the next four to five days.

18 to 20 districts are likely to be affected by the flood this year, he added.

According to a FFWC bulletin issued on Sunday morning, the flood situation in Kurigram, Gaibandha, Bogra, Jamalpur, Sirajganj, Tangail, Sylhet, Netrokona, and Sunamganj may worsen in the next 24 hours, while Lalmonirhat and Nilphamari are likely to remain stable.

The bulletin, which showed data available until 9am yesterday, said that water levels of all main rivers were on a rising trend and this would likely continue for the next three days.

In the next 24 hours, the water level of the Padma River may cross the danger level at Goalanda point.

The water levels of the Teesta and Dharala are likely to remain steady for the next 24 hours, added the bulletin.

Water levels at 86 river stations out of 101 monitored by the FFWC, marked a rise until 9am Sunday, while 13 stations recorded a fall. Two others remained unchanged.

Water levels were flowing above the danger level at 14 stations.

The Brahmaputra at Chilmari point is flowing 72cm above the danger level, while the Surma river at Sylhet point is flowing 2cm above the danger level, according to a FFWC bulletin issued at 3pm on Sunday.

Hydrology expert Dr Ainun Nishat said: ""Flooding during June-July is normal because of rainfall and upstream water flow. However, the monsoon is more active this year.

He said the matter of concern is whether any region is flooded with the collapse of an embankment or not.

""The government should work seriously to protect the embankments as huge sums of money are being spent on them year after year. Now it needs to hold officials concerned, accountable,"" he said.

The embankments are built and protected by the Bangladesh Water Development Board. Dr Nishat suggested the authorities concerned should also bring the Local Government Division into the process.

About the distribution of relief materials, Md Akram Hossain, additional secretary at the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, said: ""We have already given money and other relief materials to the district administrations for helping them to face various calamities.

""In this case [flood], we are yet to receive any demand for relief purposes from the district administrations. As per their demand, we will provide relief materials,"" he added.

Weather forecast

A 24-hour bulletin issued by the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) at 9am yesterday said light to moderate rain/thunder showers accompanied by temporary gusty winds are likely to occur at most places over Rajshahi, Rangpur, Dhaka, Mymensingh, Barisal, Chittagong and Sylhet divisions, and at many places over Khulna division, with moderately heavy to very heavy rainfall at places across the country.

As a result, it is better for the waterlogged people to stay where they have taken shelter.

As the flood forecasting and warning center, the water level is rising at 49 out of 101 points in different rivers of the country while going over the danger level in 16 points. In Kurigram, the water of Brahmaputra river is flowing at 51 cm above the maximum danger level.

Flood type this year

The country usually experiences one to three floods a year. Floods that occur in late June or mid-July usually last from one week to 10 days. The floods occur mainly in the haor area of ​​Sylhet and along the Brahmaputra and Teesta basins. Chattogram, four districts on both banks of the Padma, the Atrai basin in the north has been flooded this year. Within a week, the waters of the Atrai River could cross the danger line and spread to wider areas of Naogaon, Joypurhat and Bogura.

There are flood waters only in some low lying areas of Munshiganj in the Ganges-Padma basin. However, in the next three to four days, floods may spread to Shariatpur, Madaripur, Faridpur and Rajbari in this area.

There is a lot of rain upstream in Halda, Sangu and Matamuhuri rivers. In the middle of this month, floods may occur in Chattogram, Bandarban, Khagrachhari and Rangamati districts on both banks of these rivers. Floods may occur on both banks of rivers in the haor areas of Sylhet and Sunamganj within a week.

According to the Institute of Flood and Water Management of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), the floods in 1998 lasted for 33 days, while the floods of 2004 and 2014 lasted for 16 days. The floods in 1995 and 1996 lasted for 12 days.

Saiful Islam, a professor in BUET's Department of Flood and Water Management, told Prothom Alo, ""Floods are becoming more intense than ever in terms of water level and duration. But I don’t see the kind of preparedness and state initiatives for floods that they take during cyclone. We have to include NGOs besides government organisations for flood management.”

Dhaka/Kuala Lumpur/Geneva, 30 June 2020: Urgent early action is being taken to protect lives in Bangladesh as floods threaten 4.1 million people in large areas across the country that are already grappling with COVID-19.

The Global Flood Awareness System (GLOFAS) has issued a flood forecast with a more than 50 per cent probability of a severe 1-in-10-year flood submerging some areas of Bangladesh for at least three days.

A 5-day forecast by Bangladesh’s Flood Forecast and Warning Centre (FFWC) has also confirmed the severity of the floods. Bangladesh Red Crescent Society is implementing early actions with forecast-based funds from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to protect the lives, property and livelihoods of more than 16,500 people most at risk in three districts: Kurigram, Gaibandha and Jamalpur.

Bangladesh Red Crescent Society Secretary General Feroz Salah Uddin said: “The flood water is rising alarmingly and many areas are already inundated. Our volunteers and staff are on the ground to assist the most vulnerable communities before the water reaches the danger level.

“This funding will help us accelerate our early actions when time is running out.”

The forecast has triggered the release of more than 230,000 Swiss francs (240,000 US dollars) from IFRC’s designated fund for anticipatory action, Forecast-based Action by the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund.

This funding will help support Bangladesh Red Crescent in evacuating people in the most at risk communities to safe shelters with their valuable assets and livestock; providing unconditional cash grants to those affected; and giving first aid treatment to those who need it. Precautionary measures are also being taken to reduce the risk of COVID-19 by pre-positioning facemasks and hand sanitisers for distribution.

IFRC Head of Bangladesh Country Office Azmat Ulla said: “As a potentially severe flood continues to threaten millions of people in Bangladesh, we are taking a variety of preparedness measures to save lives and reduce loss. Together with Bangladesh Red Crescent we are reaching out to the communities in need to help them evacuate and to provide them with cash grants that give people in the path of floodwaters the ability to address their most urgent needs.

“The compounding effects of COVID-19 and the floods could be devastating and this funding is crucial to reducing the impact as much as possible.”

This is the second time in six weeks that IFRC has released forecast-based funds to support early and life-saving action in Bangladesh, after releasing more than 134,000 Swiss francs (138,000 US dollars) ahead of Cyclone Amphan in May.

Early actions and forecast thresholds are pre-defined and agreed in BDRCS’ Early Action Protocol for Floods that has been developed with support of German Red Cross and Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre.","Tue, 30 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BangladeshFloods1.jpg,"['crescent', 'support', 'lives', 'red', 'forecast', 'action', 'save', 'amid', 'flood', 'bangladesh', 'floods', 'risk', 'severe', 'early']",

Without an improvement in weather condition soon, the flood situation will continue to worsen in haor areas

Incessant rain and onrush of water from upstream have triggered flash floods in the low-lying areas of Sylhet and Sunamganj under Sylhet division.

In Sylhet, low-lying areas of four upazilas were inundated due to heavy rainfall in the last 24 hours.

The Meteorological Department in Sylhet said 107mm of rainfall was reordered in the last 24 hours. The rain may continue through this week, it added.

Several villages in Jaintiapur, Gowainghat, Companiganj, and Kanaighat upazilas have been inundated by the upstream water flows following the downpour.

As of 12 pm on Saturday, the Surma Rivers was flowing 40cm above the danger mark at Kanaighat point while the Kushiyara River was flowing very close to the danger line, said the local hydrology department.

Meanwhile, the flash flood has rendered hundreds of thousands of people waterlogged and without access to drinking water. All roads except the Dhaka-Companiganj-Bholaganj Highway have been inundated in knee-deep floodwater.

Sylhet Disaster Management and Relief Officer Md Ershad Miya said the government has taken all-out measures to tackle the flood situation. “Shelter centres and relief materials are kept at the ready.”

Meanwhile in Sunamganj, the Surma River was at 46cm above the danger mark at Sholaghar point in the town, while the Jadukata River was flowing at 56cm above the danger mark in Bishwamvarpur upazila on Saturday morning, confirmed Sabibur Rahman, executive engineer of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) in Sunamganj.

As a result, areas in the municipality, including Nabinagar, Sholaghar, Kazir point, Pashchimbazar, Ukilpara, Shantibag, and Jagannathbari remained waterlogged.

The flash flood also triggered river erosion in many parts of Sunamganj Sadar, Dowarabazar, Shulla, and Chhatak upazila, the BWDB official said.

In the last 24 hours, 190mm of rainfall was recorded in Sunamganj. Without an improvement in weather condition, the flood situation will continue to worsen in haor areas including Tahirpur, Bishwamvarpur, Jamalganj, and Dharmapasha upazila, he added.

Sunamganj Deputy Commissioner Md Abdul Ahad said: “In order to deal with the flood situation, control rooms have been opened in the district. Upazila administrations are constantly monitoring water levels. Meanwhile, shelter centres and relief materials are kept ready.”

Two people drown

Two people, including a child, drowned as their boat sank due to strong winds in the Kalni River in Sunamganj’s Derai upazila on Saturday morning,

Identities of the deceased are yet to be determined, said Derai police station Officer-in-charge (OC) KM Nazrul Islam.

An engine-run boat with two passengers left the dock and was heading to Markuli Bazar in Derai upazila. But, as the boat sank in the Kalni River due to strong winds, the boatmen managed to swim ashore, but the two unidentified passengers drowned. Locals later recovered their bodies.

Thousands waterlogged as Teesta overflows in Rangpur

Thousands of families continue to remain waterlogged in Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari, Kurigram, and Thakurgaon under Rangpur division with the Teesta, Dharla, and Brahmaputra rivers still above its danger marks.

According to Rangpur Water Development Board (WDB) sources, water levels of the major rivers and tributaries may continue to rise during the next few days in the Brahmaputra basin.

The Teesta continued to flow 20cm above the danger mark at Dalia point in Nilphamari and Lalmonirhat, while Dharla rose to 43cm above the danger mark at Bridge point in Kurigram and the Brahmaputra to 38cm above the danger mark at Chilmari point in Kurigram on Saturday.

Executive engineer of the Teesta Barrage division of WDB Md Rabiul Islam said all 44 gates of the Teesta Barrage were opened at Dalia point in Nilphamari to control the upstream water.

The overflow of water has damaged crops and seedbeds of Aman paddy. Fish farmers have also been severely affected as the fish were released from the ponds because of the flooding. Moreover, domestic animals have also been affected and farmers are trying their best to get their cattle to higher grounds.

The flash flood in the country's north-east may last for three more days while floodwaters in six districts are likely to swell for seven more days.

Floodwaters in north-eastern districts, including Sylhet and Sunamganj, may continue to rise for three more days, said an official at Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB).

The flash-flood situation may start improving from the middle or end of this week, he told the FE.

Floodwaters may mostly deluge Kurigram, Gaibandha, Jamalpur, Sylhet, Sunamganj, Lalmonirhat and Nilphamari, said BWDB executive engineer Md Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan.

However, the flood situation in these districts may start improving after a week, he added.

Seven districts are already under flooding due to heavy rainfall compounded by torrential rain in the Indian state of Meghalaya and Assam according to the BWDB.

Hundreds of thousands of homesteads have been submerged in the flood-hit districts.

""We've sent flood warning to the district administrations concerned so that they can take precautionary measures as per the BWDB's recommendations,"" said Mr Bhuiyan.

Flood may also cause river erosion and damage to the embankment. The local administration has also been asked for immediate response to this end, he added.

""We've asked the inhabitants of low-lying areas to take refuge in flood shelter centres,"" Mr Bhuiyan cited.

Relief distribution and evacuation process have already been taken in the affected areas, he mentioned.

The Brahmaputra and Jamuna may continue to rise in the next 10 days with an almost 100-per cent chance of flooding as water level exceeds danger point in Fulchar of Gaibandha, Bahadurabad of Jamalpur, Sariakandi of Bogura, Sirajganj and Kazipur of Sirajganj.

""This may result in short-medium flooding (at least five to seven days) in lowlands of these districts,"" according to a BWDB forecast issued on Saturday.

""The Ganges-Padma river may rise. The Padma at Bhagyakul of Munshiganj and Goalanda of Rajbari may cross danger level in the next five days.""

Rivers around Dhaka city may swell, but there is no probability of flooding, the forecast centre predicted.

Flood is likely to hit some more districts in the low-lying areas of the districts next week and then the flood may recede, the official told the FE.

The districts include Kurigram, Gaibandha, Jamalpur, Kaunia of Rangpur, Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari, Bogura, Dinajpur, Naogaon, Sirajganj, Tangail, Manikganj, Munshiganj, Madaripur, Shariatpur, Faridpur, Rajbari and Netrokona.

According to the flood warning centre, water level in 78 out of 102 points of different rivers is rising.

The flood situation has worsened in several northern districts of the country, with people living these areas facing their worst nightmare with their houses, croplands, livestock and ponds still under water.

According to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), water levels may continue to rise in the Padma, Brahmaputra, Dhaleswari and Jamuna river, causing further damage to the adjacent areas.

Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) has forecast heavy to extreme rainfall in the northern part of the country, which may increase the water level of the rivers crossing through the areas.

In this situation, while the farmers of the districts are estimating the huge losses they might suffer in the wake of the floods, the rest of the flood-hit people are waiting to get relief or food assistance from the government and passing their days in conditions of starvation.

In Tangail, the rising water level of the Jamuna river --that left 1,24,571 people of 93 villages and 4,575 hectares of land inundated-- is receding in the district.

Although the water level was still above the danger mark at the Jamuna by 41cm, the Dhaleswari by 83cm and the Jhinai by 47cm till Thursday morning, BWDB sources said conditions would remain steady for the rest of the week.

Locals said that the flood situation was worsening in the district and yet they were not getting enough food relief from the local administration.

Meanwhile, the agriculture office of the district feared that the waterlogged crop fields might cause a huge loss as most of the crop fields of the area are underwater.

In Jamalpur, over three lakh people of 42 unions in six upazilas and eight municipalities remained waterlogged, confirmed Abdul Mannan, gauge reader of BWDB.

The water level was still 77cm above the danger mark till Thursday afternoon and could rise even further, he said.

Around ten thousand hectares of croplands in the district have been inundated. The crops include jute, Aush, seedbeds of Aman paddy, vegetables, teel and maize, said Aminul Islam, according to the department of agriculture extension.

Though the district’s Relief and Rehabilitation officer, Md Nayeb Ali, said a sufficient amount of relief was being distributed among the flood-affected people, local residents claimed that they were in acute shortage of food as well as shelter.

In Naogaon, persistent rain and rising water levels have inundated thousands of hectares of croplands and washed away fish from hundreds of ponds.

Local sources said floodwaters entered Manda upazila through a broken embankment, leaving hundreds of villages of Tetulia and Kalikapur unions waterlogged.

In Sunamganj, as many as 500 fish farmers in Sunamganj have suffered huge losses, estimated at around Tk21 crore, in this year's floods that washed away their ponds.

After the floods inundated 2,846 ponds in the district, about 2,846 tons of fish from the ponds escaped into the floodwaters, according to the Fisheries Department in Sunamganj.

According to the District Fisheries Office, persistent heavy rainfall upstream has flooded local haors and rivers in 11 upazilas of the district.

At least 1,21,743 fishermen, who have invested in these water bodies in the area, will suffer a great loss because of the floods, said the officer.

Meanwhile, the floods have inundated 40% of land, leading to at least 1,21,354 families and 3,265 hectares of land being waterlogged, said the local administration.","Thu, 02 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2020/07/watermarked/334585/1593709471223whatsapp-image-2020-07-02-at-22-12-1593707412361.jpg,"['hectares', 'food', 'remains', 'inundated', 'water', 'worsen', 'district', 'local', 'far', 'north', 'floods', 'level', 'cry', 'relief', 'continue', 'huge']",

The first wave between June 26- July 7 inundated 12 districts

The country will witness a second wave of floods from July 11, which will submerge 23 districts of the country, the State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief has said.

“According to the forecast of the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), water levels of the Brahmaputra, Jamuna, Meghna and Padma will start rising from July 10-11. During this time, 20-23 districts will be submerged,” Md Enamur Rahman said at a press conference from his office at the Secretariat on Thursday.

He said: “We have given directives on preparing a large number of shelters as a number of districts will be inundated this time. All would have to wear masks and maintain physical distance in the shelter centres.”

However, he did not mention the number of shelter centres to be used. “The deputy commissioners will send updated information on how many shelter centres will be used and how many people will take shelter there everyday.”

“Two hundred tons of rice, 2,000 packages of dry food, Tk2 lakh for food for children, Tk2 lakh for cattle fodder and Tk2-Tk5 lakh will be sent to the deputy commissioners of each of the 23 districts,“ he said.

A high level meeting was held on Thursday among the ministries concerned to tackle the impending calamity. The cabinet secretary was present at the meeting presided over by the state minister.

Enamur said: “Some important decisions were made in the meeting. The Local Government Division [LGD] will ensure pure drinking water and sanitary latrines. School complexes will be used as shelter centres, if needed. The Water Resource ministry will be alert to protecting dams.”

“The Agriculture Ministry will provide seeds, fertilizers and seedlings free of cost to the affected farmers after the water level declines. Loans at a minimum interest rate will be ensured for affected fish farmers,” he said.

The state minister said that there was no shortage of food and hence there was “nothing to be worried about.”

“The Armed Forces Division will take part in relief and rescue operations, if necessary,” he added.

“The first wave of floods in the country was between June 26 and July 7, when the water levels of all major rivers flowed above the danger mark. The loss and damage from the first wave of floods is yet to be calculated,” he further added.

Districts to go under water

Districts expected to witness flooding are Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Rangpur, Nilphamari, Gaibandha, Sylhet, Sunamganj, Netrokona, Kishoreganj, Bogra, Sirajganj, Jamalpur, Tangail, Rajbari, Madaripur, Shariatpur, Chandpur, Munshiganj, Faridpur, Manikganj, Rajshahi, Natore, and Naogaon.

However, the first wave of the floods inundated 12 districts, mostly in the northern part of the country.

FFWC forecast

The Meteorological Department said that in the next 72 hours, the northern and north-eastern districts of Bangladesh may face heavy to very heavy rainfall. The Indian states of Assam, West Bengal and Meghalaya will experience heavy to very heavy rainfall during the period.

The Flood Forecast and Warning Centre (FFWC) noted in its forecast: “For this reason, the water level in all the rivers of the northern and north-eastern regions may rise rapidly.”","Thu, 09 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2020/07/watermarked/335267/1594312184966tista-flate-pic-1594289540547.jpg,"['state', 'submerge', 'water', 'districts', 'northern', 'heavy', 'used', 'second', '23', 'wave', 'shelter', 'floods', 'number']",

Not enough relief material for distribution, says UP chairmen

Hundreds and thousands of people in the northern districts of the country have been marooned as water levels remain above the danger level.

The flood situation remained mostly steady with little ups and downs in water levels of major rivers during the last 24 hours ending at 9am yesterday in the seven districts of the Brahmaputra basin.

However, this gives little respite to villagers who are out of food, fresh water, and shelter.

More than 50,000 people in Kurigram have been living barely on dry food for the last week, and spending nights under the open sky.

Sadar Upazila Pachgachi Union Parishad Chairman Delowar Hossain told Dhaka Tribune that his union has been underwater for some time now. Although the floodwaters are receding, over 4,000 people are without roofs over their heads.

However, he said that food rations were provided to him for distribution to 400 families only.

Jatrapur UP Chairman Ayub Ali shared a similar experience. He said that only four tons of rice were provided for distribution which was not nearly enough. Similar allegations arose throughout the district.

Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) officials said that water levels of major rivers continue receding at a slower rate amid monsoon rainfall and some increase in onrushing water from the upstream during the period in the basin.

According to BWDB’s Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), the rainfall during the last 24 hours till 9am at different points were recorded at 160mm in Gaibandha, 132mm in Kurigram, 105mm in Dalia, 95mm in Chilmari and 80.50mm in Thakurgaon.

Besides, the rainfall was recorded at 80mm in Pasighat, 78mm in Gangtok and 55mm in Cherrapunji points in the upper catchment areas in the northwestern Indian states during the period.

However, water levels of the Brahmaputra-Jamuna river system may continue to recede at a slower rate during the next 72 hours while Dharla and Teesta rise during the next 24 hours.

The overall flood situation may remain steady in Kurigram, Gaibandha, Bogura, Jamalpur, and Sirajganj districts during the next 24 hours in the Brahmaputra basin.

BWDB officials said the major rivers were flowing above the danger marks at nine points of Kurigram, Gaibandha, Jamalpur, Bogra, and Sirajganj districts at 9am yesterday despite continuous fall in their water levels at most points during the last 24 hours.

The Brahmaputra was flowing 41cm above the danger level at Noonkhawa and 46cm above at Chilmari while Dharla was at 49cm above the danger marks at Kurigram and Ghagot 31cm above at Gaibandha points last morning.

The Jamuna was flowing 70cm above the danger level at Fulchhari, 74cm above at Bahadurabad, 60cm at Sariakandi, 64cm at Kazipur and 46cm at Sirajganj points at 9am yesterday.

In Rajbari, Padma is flowing 44cm above the danger level at Goalundo point.

Floodwaters are rising in villages under Lalgola, Mahadevpur, and Urakanda unions of Sadar upazila, and Daulatdia and Debagram unions of Goalundo upazila.

Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) Daulatdia point gauge reader Idris Ali said that the water level further increased by 6cm over the last 24 hours, which is still above the danger level by 44cm.

In Gaibandha, although the water levels of Brahmaputra, Ghaghat and Karatia rivers were receding by a few centimetres in the last three to four days, Teesta has been on the rise since yesterday leading to fears of worsening flooding among locals.

Teesta River rose by 18cm yesterday, but was still flowing below danger level, said Moklechur Rahman, District WBD official.

However, the fall in water level in other places showed river erosion in Saghata Upazila.

400,000 marooned in Jamalpur

In Jamalpur, the flood situation remained unchanged over the last 24 hours. About 400,000 villagers remain marooned.

Jamuna River’s water level went down by 5cm over the last 24 hours but is still above danger level by 74cm.

BWDB official Abdul Mannan confirmed the matter to our district correspondent.

Shiduli union of Madarganj upazila has flooded recently. A total of seven upazilas and 43 unions have been flooded.

Ten thousand hectares of croplands are underwater said Aminul Islam, Deputy Director, District Agriculture Department.

Dr Pranay Kanti Das, the civil surgeon of Jamalpur, said 80 teams are working to treat the villagers.

District Relief and Rehabilitation Officer, Mohammad Nayeb Ali said the Deputy Commissioner’s (DC) Office has distributed 60-ton rice and Tk5 lakh to the villagers.

In Dinajpur, rainfall since Thursday midnight and early Friday has led to the rise in the water level of all rivers which are now flowing dangerously close to the danger level.

Punarbhaba, Atrai, and Ichamati rivers are now just a few decimal points below the danger level, said BWDB officials.

Over 120,000 people marooned in Tangail

Around 124,000 villagers are waterlogged in 101 villages and 3,631 hectares of croplands are submerged in floodwaters in Tangail.

The water level of the Jamuna, Jhinai, and Dhaleshwari rivers were above the danger line by 45cm, 48cm, and 88cm respectively, yesterday.

District Water Development Board (WDB) Deputy Assistant Engineer Rezaul Karim said the water level of the rivers will rise further in the days to come.

According to district Relief and Rehabilitation office sources, the rising waters have flooded 101 villages in 21 unions of Sadar, Nagarpur, Delduar, Bhuapur, Kalihati, and Gopalpur upazilas.

The homes of 532 families and a school have been washed away by the rivers and 147sq/km of land in these six upazilas are flooded.

Roads, communication cut off

The ongoing flood has damaged and inundated different points of around 150km of road, bringing road communication between Tahirpur, Bishwambarpur, Dowarabazar and Jamalpur upazilas in Sunamganj to a halt.

Mahbub Alam, the executive engineer of Sunamganj Local Government Engineering Department, said: ""We have visited few of the damaged spots. The repair work will start soon.""

Flood water began to recede from houses and the Water Development Board recorded 11mm of rainfall in the district in the last 24 hours until around 10:30am.

Yesterday, the Surma River in Sunamganj point was reported to be flowing three centimetres below the danger mark.

June 30 (UPI) -- As June winds down, the Southwest monsoon is in full force across India, and rainfall totals are climbing to staggering levels as rising floodwaters leave thousands stranded.

During a five-day stretch from June 23-28, Cherrapunji, located in a region of India to the northeast of Bangladesh, reported 77.51 inches. Around 22.52 inches of that total fell in the last 24 hours of that stretch, stated AccuWeather senior meteorologist Jim Andrews.

As of Friday, the leading edge of the monsoon advanced through the country and moved into Pakistan.

Widespread rainfall totals of 8 or more inches have been measured along the western coast of India, across the center of the country and into northeastern regions since the monsoon arrived throughout the month, according to the India Meteorological Department.

RELATED India moves air defense missiles to Chinese border

In addition to impressive rainfall totals, runoff from northern India has caused multiple rivers across Bangladesh to rise over 30 inches above dangerous levels on Monday, Bangladesh Water Development Board Northern division chief engineer Jotiy Prasad Gosh said.

Gosh added that the rise in water levels flooded 19 upazilas, or regions, leaving 200,000 people stranded and thousands of hectares of farmland submerged under floodwaters.

Many in the region are still waiting for relief as officials process the requests for help from the upazilas, reported New Age Bangladesh.

The wet season will remain in full swing across the region as occasional showers and thunderstorms persist in much of India and Bangladesh each day through midweek. However, parts of extreme northwestern India will remain largely dry, including New Delhi, which had the onset of the monsoon last week.

The areas most at risk for flooding through the middle of the week will be areas that have already been hit hard by monsoon rain this month.

Heavy thunderstorms are expected to unfold in parts of northeastern India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan each day this week, with some locations potentially receiving 12 inches of rain through Friday.

Meanwhile, drenching downpours will remain across southwestern India from around Mumbai to western Karnataka in the coming days.

The heaviest rain in southwestern India will fall from near the coast into the Western Ghats.

Daily rainfall totals of 2 inches to 4 inches are expected for areas that receive the heaviest rain into the end of the week. An AccuWeather Local StormMax of 8 inches will be possible, especially in the rugged terrain.

By the end of the week and into the weekend, a monsoon low can develop in northeastern India and lead to locally heavy rainfall in Jharkhand, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. This low may eventually bring the return of rain to National Capitol Region later in the weekend and early next week.","Tue, 30 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi_com/2341593563075/2020/1/d547e95d7836e0ee4591947bd3b88a60/v1.5/Torrential-rain-produces-severe-flooding-in-India-strands-over-200000-in-Bangladesh.jpg,"['totals', '200000', 'region', 'flooding', 'inches', 'western', 'produces', 'monsoon', 'torrential', 'rainfall', 'strands', 'india', 'bangladesh', 'rain', 'severe', 'week']",

Currently, the water level is above the danger mark at eight points only. At four of those points, the water level is decreasing

Although the flood situation in the country’s northern parts has improved due to a fall in water levels of all our major rivers, erosion has taken a serious turn in flood affected districts, rendering many people homeless.

Of the 101 water level monitoring stations across Bangladesh monitored by the Bangladesh Water Development Board , 63 stations observed a decrease in water levels, while 37 saw an increase. The water level was unchanged at one station.

Currently, the water level is above the danger mark at eight points only. At four of those points, the water level is decreasing.

The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) provided the information in their flood forecast on Tuesday morning.

However, as people started to return home from the various institutional shelters in the affected areas, they found their homes still waterlogged, and croplands under threat of severe river erosion.

During the first five days of July, there were 14 to 16 points in rivers across the country where the water level was flowing above the danger mark.

According to FFWC, the flood situation may improve in Sirajganj, Rajbari, Faridpur, Dhaka, Munshiganj, and Shariatpur in the next 24 hours, while that of Natore and Naogaon may remain unchanged.

It also said the water levels of the Brahmaputra, the Jamuna, and the upper Meghna basin are falling, and that is expected to continue for the next 48 hours. The waters of the Padma and the Ganges basin may also go down in that same time period too.

The Padma River has already gone below the danger level at Mawa point, while the Goalundo and Bhagyakul points of the mighty river also saw the waters recede somewhat.

Currently, the Padma River is flowing two centimeters above the danger mark at Bhagyakul point, 19 centimeters at Goalundo point, and 10 centimeters at Shoreswar point.

Affected people continue to suffer

In Kurigram, despite the water levels being below the danger point in 16 rivers, including the Brahmaputra, Dharla, and the Teesta, erosion has hit flood affected people very hard.

Sardob, Mogholbasa and Nunkhawa flood control embankments were damaged due to erosion by the Brahmaputra, Teesta, and Dharla rivers in the last few days, reports UNB.

Over 500 families lost their dwellings due to river erosion in Joykumar, Thetai, and Kalirhat areas in Ulipur upazila.

Almost 200 meters of the Saardob flood control embankment was eaten up by the Teesta River, putting 20 villages under a flood threat.

Ariful Islam, an executive engineer at the local Water Development Board (WDB), said they have taken emergency steps to protect the areas from river erosion.

In Jamalpur, the overall flood situation in the district significantly improved when the Jamuna River dropped by 23 centimeters and was flowing at 10 centimeters below the danger level at Bahadurabad Ghat point in the last 24 hours.

According to district relief and rehabilitation office sources, over 396,744 people of a total of 351 villages in 49 unions under all seven upazilas of the district have been affected, reports BSS.

The local office of the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) said that standing crops on 4,455, out of 13,343 hectares of land have been damaged by floodwaters amounting to a loss of over Tk43.52 crore.

In Nilphamari, the floodwaters have been receding and were flowing 20 centimeters below the danger mark till 3pm on Tuesday on theTeesta River. But people hit by the floods in six unions of Dimla upazila continue to suffer much hardship.

At least 3,245 people were marooned in the floods and they are currently facing a severe food crisis as most of their homes and properties are still underwater.

“Not only that, at least 79 families lost their homes to river erosion, and while most of the people of these villages are jobless, scarcity of food and living quarters are making things hard for them,” said Abdul Latif Khan, chairman of Chatnai union parishad.

District Relief and Rehabilitation Officer SA Hayat said: “We have provided 15kg of staple food to each of the 3,245 families.”

In Tangail, around 132,191 people in 137 villages have been marooned and 3,686 hectares of croplands flooded in six upazilas.

The numbers were confirmed by the office of district relief and rehabilitation.

As of Tuesday, at least 585 houses and other infrastructure got devoured by the Jamuna River, and as many as 1,065 structures, including houses, were partially damaged by river erosion.

“We are installing Geo Bags to save the erosion hit areas,” said Sirajul Islam, executive engineer of BWDB’s local branch.

In Magura, around 50 families were forced to shift from the banks of the Padma River to other places due to the threat of river erosion.

“I have informed local administration officials and other representatives about the severity of the situation but they are yet to take any action,” said Liakat Ali Biswas, chairman of Kadirpara union parishad.

Contacted, executive engineer of BWDB, Sarwar Jahan Sujon, said: “We have submitted an extensive plan to higher authorities for managing the situation. As soon as we get their approval, we will start the project.”

Already flooded this year, people in the lowlands and haor areas of Sunamganj are seeing fresh flooding again due to heavy rainfall and water from upstream.

The Surma river was 17cm above the danger mark at Shologhar point and the Jadukata River was flowing 23cm above the danger mark in Bishwamvarpur upazila at 9am on Friday.

The district water development board has recorded 183mm of rainfall in the last 24 hours.

Situation in Kurigram remains unchanged and deteriorates in Tangail and Jamalpur while Sunamganj sees some improvement



The flood situation in Kurigram has remained unchanged while it deteriorated in Tangail and Jamalpur with an increase in water level in some places, and the condition improved slightly in Sunamganj.

In Kurigram, the flood situation remained unchanged due to the rise of water levels in Brahmaputra, Dharla, and Dudkumar rivers for the last six days.

Ariful Islam, executive engineer of Kurigram Water Development Board, said the water level in Dharala River at Kurigram Bridge point is flowing 43cm above the danger level while Brahmaputra River at Chilmari point is flowing 64cm above the red level and 53cm above the danger level at Nunkhawa point, reports UNB.

People in the flood-affected areas said they have been suffering a lot due to the shortage of dry food, pure drinking water, and relief materials as they did not get any relief from the government.

District Civil Surgeon Dr Habibur Rahman said three children drowned in the floodwater in the last three days till Tuesday.

They are Mostakim, a 14-month-old boy of Saiful Islam of Ulipur upazila, Belal Hossain, 8, son of Amir Hossain of Nageshwari upazila, and Shanta Islam, 7, son of Zahed Islam of Chilmari upazila of the district.

ABM Abul Hossain, Chairman of Hatiya union, said the floodwater entered the union, forcing 700 people to take shelter on the roads.

Dilip Kumar Saha, District Relief and Rehabilitation officer, said some 357 villages under 55 unions out of 77 unions have been flooded while 29.5km of the embankment was damaged due to flood.

Some 3,922 hectares of land have gone underwater, he said.

So far, 302MT rice and Tk36.50 lakh have been allocated for the people in nine upazilas of the district, he added.

In Tangail, all three rivers—Jamuna, Jhenai, and Dhaleshwari are flowing over the danger line, worsening the overall flood situation in the district, Executive Engineer of Water Development Board (WDB) Sirajul Islam told Dhaka Tribune.

According to the District Relief and Rehabilitation office, due to the rise in the water level around 23,000 people have become marooned with 60 villages completely flooded.

Also a 2.5km of dam on the Jamuna River bank has collapsed and the flood has damaged 4,340 hectares of cropland in the region, according to the District Agriculture office.

“We are working to prevent river erosion in important places among the affected areas,” Sirajul said.

In Jamalpur, water-level in the Jamuna River is currently flowing 84cm above the danger level and more than 300,000 people in the district are stuck due to water-logging.

The floodwater has entered into 42 unions under seven upazilas of the district. Road connectivity in many of the flooded areas has become disconnected due to the rise in the water level.

The District administration has distributed 60MT rice and Tk5 lakh cash to residents of the flooded areas who are passing a difficult time due to shortage of drinking water and food.

WDB Executive Engineer Md Abu Sayeed said the water-level of Brahmaputra River is flowing 15.68cm above the danger-level.

In Sunamganj, the overall flood condition has improved a little. The water from the highland areas has started decreasing while the haors and low lying lands are still underwater.

Boats were seen sailing on the low-lying lands of the region.

General overview

The Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDRCS) has activated its Early Action Protocol for floods. The EAP pre-activation was triggered when the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) issued a flood forecast of 50 per cent or more probability of a once in a ten-year flood projection and thereafter remaining above that threshold for three days. The GLOFAS forecast on 24 June 2020 suggests that on 2 July 2020, the water level at the Bahadurabaad station will cross a once in ten-year return period (115 000 m3 /s) and remain consistent for three days. This corresponds to an impact forecast that 3.7 million population or and about 1 million households will be affected. This forecasted flood depth was then combined with a vulnerability map, to estimate the percentage of houses that could be at risk of getting impacted in each union. All unions with more than 25 per cent of houses at risk were placed on a ‘priority’ list and the top-ranking unions were selected for early actions. As shown in the table below, the EAP will be implemented in nine unions of Kurigram, Gaibandha and Jamalpur districts

BDRCS will target 3,300 households in nine unions in three districts (3 union in each district) which have more than 25 percent of household asset damage.

BDRCS will provide: (i) Support for boat evacuation of people, livestock, moveable assets, (ii)

Multi-purpose cash grant (MPCG) of BDT 4,500 (CHF 50) and (iii) basic first aid service for injuries and sickness.

This is the pre-activation trigger to kick start beneficiary selection for cash transfers. The decision on whether or not to go for cash transfer will be made through the activation trigger, which is based on the deterministic forecast from Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC).","Fri, 26 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1524295-EAP2019BD02_notification_MDRBD025.png?itok=IzmSIwjF,"['forecast', 'trigger', 'based', 'million', 'action', 'unions', 'union', 'cash', 'preactivation', 'flood', 'bangladesh', 'floods', 'tenyear', 'risk', 'triggered', 'eap2019bd02', 'early']",

The flood situation remained unchanged with little ups and downs in water levels of major rivers causing major suffering for thousands of families in the area

Many new areas in the northern districts of the country have been submerged due to heavy rainfall and onrush of water from upstream as water level of Teesta, Brahmaputra, and Jamuna continues to flow over the danger mark.

The flood situation remained unchanged with little ups and downs in water levels of major rivers causing major suffering for thousands of families in the area.

Officials of the district administrations said nearly 500,000 people of the low-lying areas in seven flood-prone northern districts of Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari, Gaibandha, Bogra, Jamalpur, and Sirajganj basin have been marooned.

In Nilphamari, the Teesta was flowing 22cm above the danger mark at Dalia point for the last 24 hours until 9am on Saturday, confirmed Nurul Islam, the gauge reader at Teesta Barrage.

All 44 gates of the Teesta Barrage were kept open since this morning to control the strong current, he said.

“The water level has now fallen and the river is flowing 18cm over the danger mark as of 12pm on Saturday,” he added.

Low-lying areas of Dimla, Jaldhaka and Lalmonirhat were inundated due to heavy rains and as a result 23 families in Dimla's Baishpukur area have become stranded, Dalia Water Development Board's warning centre said.

East Chhatnay Union Parishad Chairman Abdul Latif Khan said many people have shifted their homes to higher grounds as the Teesta water began flowing above the danger level Saturday morning.

Apart from East Chhatnay, homes of 3,000 families in Khagakharbari, Tepakharibari, Khalisha Chapani, Jhunagach and Gayabari of Dimla upazila have been inundated.

In Gaibandha, the water level of the Brahmaputra, Jamuna, Ghaghat, and Karatoya rivers have started receding, but the waters of the Teesta have been rising for the last two days.

The Brahmaputra was flowing 52 cm above the danger level, the Ghaghat River was flowing at 22 cm above the danger level, and the Teesta was flowing 15cm under the danger mark, Gaibandha Water Development Board’s Executive Engineer Md Mokhlesur Rahman said.

In Jamalpur, the Jamuna River dropped by 17cm and was flowing 57cm above the danger mark at Bahadurabad ghat point, said the Water Development Board (WDB).

Department of Agriculture Extension Office sources said standing crops on 13,343 hectares have been submerged by floodwater.

District Relief and Rehabilitation Officer (DRRO) Md Nayeb Ali said even though floodwater started receding but the situation is yet to improve.

He said over 387,394 people in 49 unions of all seven upazilas of the district have been affected in the flood.

In Tangail, the Jamuna was flowing at 34 cm above the danger mark, the Jhenai River was flowing at 48cm above the danger mark and the Dhaleshwari River was flowing 90cm above the danger mark.

As a result, 124, 571 people have now become stranded in six upazilas of the district.

Besides, 3,613 hectares of cropland have been submerged and the overall flood situation in the district remains unchanged, said district Relief and Rehabilitation and district Agriculture Office.","Sat, 04 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2020/07/watermarked/334782/1593879370609unnamed-1593879095009.jpg,"['flowing', 'mark', 'situation', 'flooded', 'water', 'rivers', 'danger', 'river', 'areas', 'major', 'teesta', 'district', 'level', 'continue']",

Flood-affected people have been suffering from a lack of dry food and drinking water

The overall flood situation in Tangail, Kurigram and Jamalpur has improved slightly as the water level in many major rivers has been decreasing slowly.

The Water Development Board offices in the districts said the Jamuna, Brahmaputra, Dharla and the connecting rivers were mostly flowing above the danger level on Monday but showed a declining trend in some areas.

Meanwhile, flood-affected people have been suffering from a lack of dry food and drinking water. Road communications have been disrupted badly in the three districts.

In Jamapur, the Jamuna River was flowing 10 cm above the danger mark at Bahadurabad Ghat point in Dewanganj upazila.

Abdul Mannan, Gauge Reader at Jamalpur Water Development Board, confirmed the matter.

Around 350,000 people who had taken shelter earlier began returning to their homes with the slow recession of the floodwaters.

The flood-hit people are in need of dry food and drinking water. Large portions of roads have been damaged heavily.

Floodwaters have completely damaged at least 113km of roads and partially damaged 3 km of river embankments, according to the Relief and Rehabilitation Office.

Around 13,000 hectares of cropland, including paddy and vegetables, in the district have gone under water, said Aminul Islam, deputy director of the department of agriculture extension.

In Tangail, around 129,000 people are still stranded in floodwaters while 3686 hectares of crop land remain underwater as the Jamuna, Dhaleswari and Jhinai rivers are still flowing above danger level.

Floodwaters have fully damaged at least 50km of roads and partially damaged 1064 houses, according to the Relief and Rehabilitation Office.

Regarding the situation, Tangail Water Development Board Sub-Assistant Engineer Rezaul Karim said: ""The water level in many rivers in the districts has decreased, but the water level in the Jamuna, Dhaleswari and Jhinai rivers is still flowing above danger level.

In Kurigram, the water level in the Brahmaputra and Dharla rivers at Chilmari and Nunkhwa point has decreased while the water level in some points remains above danger level.

A large number of local residents, still stranded in floodwaters, have been suffering from lack of food and safe drinking water.

A lack of dry space and fodder for livestock has forced several flood victims to sell off their livestock, namely cows and goats, only to make ends meet.

Besides, many schools and colleges are still inundated in floodwaters, while paved and unpaved roads and a vast tract of crop land have been badly damaged.

Water Development Board Executive Engineer Ariful Islam said: ""Although the water level has decreased for now, it could increase after July 9 . Many low-lying areas could go under water again in mid July.""

Human Rights Watch has called on Bangladesh to move more than 300 Rohingya refugees, including children, to the camps in Cox’s Bazaar district, more than two months after they were quarantined on a small flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal.

The Rohingya were rescued by the Bangladesh navy in early May after being stranded at sea for weeks, and sent to Bhashan Char island – a silty strip of land off the southern coast that is vulnerable to monsoon storms.

Bangladesh has said the 308 refugees were sent to the island rather than the camps in Cox’s Bazar because authorities were afraid they might have the highly infectious disease COVID-19.

“Bangladesh authorities are using the pandemic as an excuse to detain refugees on a spit of land in the middle of a churning monsoon sea while their families anxiously pray for their return,” Brad Adams, Asia director of HRW, said in a statement on Thursday.

“The government is inexplicably delaying aid workers’ access to support the refugees with immediate care, and refusing to reunite them with their families in the Cox’s Bazar camps.”

According to the US-based rights group, the quarantined refugees do not have adequate access to food, clean drinking water or medical care. Some have also alleged being beaten up and mistreated by the authorities, it said.

Bangladesh last year constructed facilities for 100,000 people on Bhashan Char, a muddy silt islet in the cyclone-prone coastal belt, saying they needed to take the pressure off crowded border camps that are home to almost one million Rohingya.

But the United Nations, rights activists and aid agencies have repeatedly raised concerns about the safety of those quarantined there and urged for relocation.

According to Bangladesh officials, the outbreak among Rohingya refugees has been “successfully contained” amid fears that the disease spread rapidly in overcrowded camps.

Some 724 Rohingya have been tested in the Bangladesh camps, with 54 found positive and five died since the first cases were detected in May, officials said.

Rohingya live in sprawling refugee camps in southern Bangladesh, most having arrived from Myanmar in late 2017 after fleeing a military crackdown that the UN said was conducted with genocidal intent.

The Myanmar army denies “genocide” and says it was carrying out a legitimate campaign against armed rebels who attacked police posts.

In January, the Hague-based International Court of Justice ordered Myanmar to take emergency measures to prevent the genocide of the Rohingya, who face widespread discrimination and have been stripped of their nationality.","Thu, 09 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eb789b69006e417dbd4dfb057b2dc578_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['hrw', 'island', 'authorities', 'camps', 'rights', 'refugees', 'coxs', 'urges', 'quarantined', 'bangladesh', 'rohingya', 'myanmar', 'floodprone']",

District Relief and Rehabilitation Officer (DRRO) Md Nayeb Ali said even though floodwater started receding but the situation is yet to improve.

He said over 387,394 people in 49 unions of all seven upazilas of the district have been affected in the flood.

”A total of 1,212 families comprising 6,094 people took shelter in 31 flood shelter centres and 34 tons of rice and Tk11 lakh cash were allotted for the flood victims,” he said, adding that upazila administrations are distributing 2,000 packets dry food among the flood victims in Islampur and Dewanganj upazila.

More floods in a week

Md Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan, executive engineer of FFWC, told Dhaka Tribune the water level may fall a little in different points in the north and northeastern districts, but it will remain above the danger level due to scattered rainfall.

“After a week, the seasonal rainfall might increase and we may see more flooding. Until then, the situation across the country will remain relatively unchanged over the next few days,” he added.

The FFWC expects the water level of Padma and Ganges to continue to rise in the next 48 hours. The Padma may cross the danger mark at Bhagyakul point during this time.

“The water level of the Brahmaputra and Jamuna remains stable. However, the Jamuna may cross the danger mark at Aricha point in the next 24 hours,” the flood forecast said.

By Inzamamul Haque

Sahil Uddin Moral, 57, used to work as a labourer to support his family of six. They live in Kurikahnia, a village in the district of Satkhira, south-west Bangladesh. In May, Cyclone Amphan washed away their hut. Moral has no money to build another, and no work as the cyclone destroyed the fisheries where he used to work.

“How do we survive now?” Moral said. “I have no way other than leaving Satkhira. I am going to Sylhet [in north-east Bangladesh] tomorrow. I have some relatives there who left Satkhira a few years ago. If I can get some work, I will take my family members there.”

Cyclone Amphan made landfall in West Bengal, India, on 20 May, and devastated the area, with indigenous residents worst affected.

The effects were just as severe in Satkhira, the adjacent district in Bangladesh. The cyclone washed away embankments, homes and the fisheries on which thousands of families used to survive.

Moral said, “During the cyclone, we were at the cyclone shelter. When we returned, we found water everywhere. We don’t know how we will recover from this damage.”

According to government estimates, approximately 150 kilometres of embankments – meant to protect villages and farms from storms and high tides that bring saline water to this coastal region – were washed away, 55,667 houses damaged beyond repair and 18,235 drinking-water points destroyed. Many freshwater ponds are flooded with saline water.

These photographs were taken a few weeks later.

According to the latest bulletin uploaded by FFWC, Padma is currently flowing 31cm above the danger level at Goalundo point at 9am on Wednesday. In the last 18 hours, water levels increased by 11cm at this point

The flood situation may deteriorate in the central districts of the country while conditions in the northern districts will remain unchanged, according to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC).

The flood forecast noted that the situation might worsen in Tangail, Manikganj, Rajbari and Faridpur due to the increase in the water levels of the Padma, Dhaleswari, Jamuna and some other rivers.

On the other hand, the flood situation may remain unchanged in Kurigram, Gaibandha, Bogra, Jamalpur and Sirajganj due to a slight fall in the water levels of the Brahmaputra, Dharla, Ghagot and Jamuna at different points.

According to the FFWC, water levels may continue to rise in the Padma and the Ganges for the next two days. Water levels of the Dhaleswari in Tangail and the Jamuna in Manikganj will continue to rise.

The Dhaleswari has crossed the danger level already and is flowing 32cm above the danger mark at Elasin point of Tangail, while the Jamuna may cross the danger level in the next 12 hours at Aricha point of Manikganj. Currently the Jamuna is flowing only 4cm from the danger point at Aricha.

Meanwhile, the Padma River is flowing at 31cm above the danger level at Goalundo point in Rajbari while the water level at the Bhagyakul, Mawa, and Sureswar point is also on the rise. At Bhagyakul point, the Padma may cross the danger level in the next 24 hours.

According to the latest bulletin uploaded by the FFWC, the Padma was flowing 31cm above the danger level at Goalundo point at 9am on Wednesday. In the last 18 hours, the water level has increased by 11cm at this point.

The water level was 13cm below danger level at Bhagyakul point of Munshiganj, increasing by 17cm in the last 18 hours. At Mawa point of the same district, the Padma is flowing 20cm below the danger line, while at Sureswar point of Shariatpur the mighty river is flowing 50cm below the danger level.

Currently the water level is above the danger mark at 14 points. Of them, water levels are increasing at six points, decreasing at seven points, and one of the points has remained unchanged in the last 24 hours.

During the same period, among the total 101 observation stations across the country, water levels increased at 53 points, decreased at 47 points and remained unchanged at one point.

FFWC Executive Engineer Md Arifuzzaman Bhuyan told Dhaka Tribune: “We do not say the flood situation in the northern districts is improving. We use the term ‘unchanged,’ as the water level may further increase a week later due to increased rainfall.”

The water levels of the Brahmaputra and Jamuna rivers may remain stable in the next 24 hours. The water levels of the rivers of the upper Meghna Basin are falling. It may continue for the next 72 hours.

Due to some rainfall, the water levels of the Dhorola, Ghagot, Brahmaputra and Jamuna rivers are flowing above the danger mark, which is delaying a swift improvement of the flood situation in the northern districts.

Weather forecast

Two days ago, almost the whole country witnessed different levels of rainfall. The rainfall was reduced on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Met Office gave a weather forecast for the next 24 hours expecting less rainfall than in the previous couple of days, which indicates a decrease in the water level in the northern districts.

According to the weather forecast from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department, light to moderate rain/thunder showers accompanied by temporary gusty winds are likely to occur at many places over Rangpur, Mymensingh, Chittagong and Sylhet divisions; at a few places over Dhaka, Khulna and Barisal divisions, and at one or two places over Rajshahi division.","Wed, 01 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2020/06/watermarked/334443/1593617542737sirajganj-flood-photo-o4-28-06-20-1593445404367.png,"['situation', 'flowing', 'ffwc', 'levels', 'water', 'districts', 'worsen', 'danger', 'padma', 'jamuna', 'flood', 'point', 'central', 'level', 'points']",

The Brahmaputra River, one of the largest rivers in the world which flows from Tibet into India and then into Bangladesh, burst its banks in Assam over the weekend, inundating more than 2,000 villages, and it was still raining on Monday.

“Two people have died in separate incidents of drowning in the past 24 hours and more than one million people have been affected, with the flood situation turning critical by the hour,” a state government flood bulletin said.

Torrential rain hit at least 23 of Assam’s 33 districts and the federal water resources body said water levels in the Brahmaputra were expected to rise, with more rain forecast over the next three days.

“The flood situation remains extremely grave with several embankments breached,” Assam Water Resources Minister Keshab Mahanta told Reuters.

Most of the Kaziranga National Park, home to the rare one-horned rhino, was under water, authorities said.

Assam, famous for its tea plantations, is hit by seasonal flooding each year, forcing state and federal governments to spend millions of rupees on flood control.

Paramilitary personnel were deployed across the state for rescue operations and to ensure people maintain social distance in makeshift shelter camps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, authorities said.

The river was flowing 35cm above the danger mark, Sirajul Islam, executive engineer of Water Development Board (WDB) in Tangail, said.

Jamuna being the principal river of Tangail, several of its branches, including Dhaleswari and Jhinai, flow through the district; consequently, its flood fury extends as far as its

Branches go with their water levels rising.

On the other hand, erosion situation has also intensified in different areas of the district, especially its Nagarpur upazila, with the swelling of the Jamuna and other rivers.

Mohammad Rokonuzzaman, NDC, who is now working as acting relief and rehabilitation officer in Tangail, said about 1 24, 571 people of at least 91 villages under 21 unions of Bhuapur, Kalihati, Nagorpur, Delduar, Gopalpur and Sadar upazilas in the district have been marooned by the flooding.

Although the flood situation has somewhat improved at Dalia point in Nilphamari, as many as 3,245 flood-affected families in six unions of Dimla upazila are under the constant worry of another flood as the water level in the Teesta River is yet to stabilize.

The Teesta was flowing 15cm below the danger mark (52.6cm) at Dalia point on Thursday.

Earlier in the week, the Teesta was flowing 5cm below the danger mark on Saturday and the day before it was 22cm over the danger mark, said Aminur Rashid, deputy assistant engineer, Nilphamari Water Development Board.

In this present situation, flood-affected families are left without income as there is no work due to lack of mobility. Some families are living on dry food, while others suffer from lack of food and safe drinking water for themselves and for their cattle.

Shahidul Islam, 53, a resident of Khaga Kharibari union, said the Teesta River may once again rise due to onrush of water from the upstream and when it does, numerous villages including houses, cattle, poultry, croplands, seedbeds and fish enclosures are submerged in an instant.

Umar Ali, 50, a resident of the same village, said that despite the improvement in the flood situation, the flood-affected people are still suffering in the upazila. Houses are still submerged in water. The amount of cooperation that has been provided by the government is not enough.

Rabiul Islam, executive engineer of the Dalia Water Development Board, said the low-lying areas in the Teesta Basin are still inundated and hundreds of stranded.

The project is being financed by IFAD and implemented by LGED

To strengthen the existing flood forecasting and warning system, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) has been signed between the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) and the Department of Disaster Management (DDM).

The MoU was signed on Monday for a project titled “Promoting Resilience of Vulnerable through Access to Infrastructure, Improved Skills and Information (PROVATi3),” said a statement issued by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).

The project is being financed by IFAD and implemented by LGED.

The initiative hopes to benefit around 488,370 people by disseminating information about potential flood threats to the inhabitants of 175 unions of 19 upazilas in three flood prone districts—Kurigram, Gaibandha, and Jamalpur.

The system will especially focus on 69 sandbank unions, which are more vulnerable to floods triggered by heavy rains.

The warning system is expected to reduce losses caused by floods in the flood prone low-lying areas of north-western Bangladesh, agricultural lands often get destroyed by floods during the monsoon season.

The floods occurring overnight also damage houses and other properties of the inhabitants of these districts, considered to be among the poorest areas of the country.

Bangladesh Water Development Board forecasts floods with its Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, while DDM is authorized to warn about floods throughout the year.

Besides reviewing the current forecasting system, DDM under the PROVATi3 project will consolidate the flood information dissemination system for better results at the community level.

PROVATi3 works to improve rural infrastructure, enhance poor people's ability to generate income, and increase access to flood information at the community level, said the press release.

Major rivers still flowing above danger level

The Padma, Jamuna, and Brahmaputra rivers, and most of their tributaries, are still swelling above the danger mark, submerging a vast area of the northern districts of the country.

The Padma River has been flowing 20 centimetres above the danger mark at Goalando point in Rajbari, and the water levels at Bhagyakul, Mawa and Sureswar points are on the rise, according to the latest bulletin by the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) on Tuesday morning.

More floods in a week

Md Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan, executive engineer of FFWC, said the water levels may fall a little at different points in the north and northeastern districts, but they will remain above the danger level due to scattered rainfall.

“After a week, the seasonal rainfall might increase and we may see more flooding. Until then, the situation across the country will remain relatively unchanged over the next few days,” he added.

The FFWC expects the water level of the Padma and Ganges to continue to rise in the next 48 hours. The Padma may cross the danger mark at Bhagyakul point during this time.

“The water level of the Brahmaputra and Jamuna remains stable. However, the Jamuna may cross the danger mark at Aricha point in the next 24 hours,” the flood forecast said.

Among 101 water level monitoring stations under the Bangladesh Water Development Board across the country, 63 stations observed decrease in water levels

Water levels of all major rivers are falling, leading to an improvement to the flood situation across the country.

Among the 101 water level monitoring stations under the Bangladesh Water Development Board across the country, 63 stations observed decrease in water levels, while 37 saw increase. The water level was unchanged in one station.

Currently, the water level is above the danger mark at eight points only. On four of those points, the water level is decreasing.

During the first five days of July, there were 14 to 16 points in rivers across the country where the water level was flowing above the danger mark.

The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) provided the information in their flood forecast at 9am on Tuesday.

The forecast said that the flood situation may improve in Sirajganj, Rajbari, Faridpur, Dhaka, Munshiganj and Shariatpur in the next 24 hours, while that of Natore and Naogaon may remain unchanged.

It also stated that the water levels of the Brahmaputra, the Jamuna, and the upper Meghna basin are falling, and that is expected to continue for the next 48 hours. However, water levels of the Padma and the Ganges basin may decrease in that time period.

The water level of the Padma has already gone below the danger level at the Mawa point, while the Goalundo and Bhagyakul points of the mighty river also saw some decrease in water level.

Currently, the Padma is flowing 2cm above the danger mark at Bhagyakul point, 19 cm at Goalundo point, and 10 cm at Shoreswar point.","Tue, 07 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2020/07/watermarked/335013/1594127008361an-aerial-view-shows-submerged-houses-at-a-flooded-area-at-sonatola-in-the-northern-district-of-bogra-courtesy-touhid-pervez-biplob-1593793577573.jpeg,"['levels', 'water', 'rivers', 'danger', 'decrease', 'padma', 'falling', 'major', 'flood', 'stations', 'point', 'level', 'points']",

State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Md Enamur Rahman has said aid packages are not being allotted since June 15 due to the drop in demand.

“These relief packages are instead being sent to flood-affected districts in the country,” he said on Wednesday, reports bdnews24.com.

Field-level officers said the demand for aid went down due to the reopening of offices and public transport on a limited scale, extension of shop and shopping mall hours to stay open, easing of the restrictive measures and the arrival of rice harvest season.

State Minister Enamur said, “Now the demand for aid is gone. Our deputy commissioners have reported the remaining relief items are still in stock. The low-income people who needed relief have returned to work while rice and mango have been harvested. All these have resolved the food crisis.”

He mentioned that a requisition for 200,000 tonnes of rice was sent to the finance ministry from the Prime Minister’s Office to keep supplies ready if needed.

A total of 100 tonnes of rice was sent to every flood-affected district along with Tk 1 million for each category ‘A’ affected districts and Tk 500,000 for every category ‘B’ zones, he added.

“We are gearing up with support in case people need aid during the floods. The forecasts say floods could last 2-3 weeks into August from the end of July.”

After the first COVID-19 case was discovered in Bangladesh on Mar 8, the education institutions were shut down on Mar 17 and offices were suspended on Mar 26 as the country went under lockdown for 66 days.

Towards the end of that month, the government began distributing aid packages for the poor, the marginalised and the jobless. The government supplied relief on Jun 11 last.

The government said it had allocated a total of over 211,000 tonnes of rice and Tk 1.23 billion in cash until then. From this, 189,182 tonnes of rice was distributed among over 71.62 million people from over 16.32 million families.

Out of Tk 958.37 million allocated as cash aid, over Tk 888 million was distributed among more than 43 million beneficiaries from nearly 9.74 million families.

The government allocated Tk 271.4 million for baby food but distributed Tk 254.02 million from the fund among over 800,000 families with over 1.7 million beneficiaries.","Sat, 04 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/uploads/1593861114.jpg,"['demand', 'tk', 'tonnes', 'mar', 'million', 'drops', 'covid19', 'sent', 'distributed', 'packages', 'rice', 'relief', 'aid']",

Amid this plight, over 1.25 lakh flood victims hardly have means to follow guidelines to keep Covid-19 outbreak at bay.

""We can't even manage safe drinking water in the flood affected areas. We are struggling to survive, so we have no time to think about coronavirus at this moment,"" said Jahanara Begum, a resident of flood-hit Shuvogachha village in Kazipur upazila.

Over 500 people in the village have taken shelter at the flood protection embankment after their houses were washed away in flood water.

They have no means to maintain social distance, wash hands regularly, or use masks to prevent Covid-19 transmission. All they have are fragments of corrugated iron sheets or polythene shed on the embankment for refuge, and may be some dry food to survive for now.

""Survival is the priority at this moment. We left everything in our flood-hit houses, and have taken shelter on the embankment. We don't have enough food,"" Jahanara told The Daily Star.

In some cases, two to three families are living under the same shed due to the lack of space.

In some other areas, the people are still trapped in their flood-hit houses. They also do not have any means to maintain health safety rules advised for the Covid-19 outbreak.

""Our house was flooded couple of weeks ago. The floor of the house, latrine and tube-well are all under flood water now. My family of six are still staying at home by putting bricks under the bed. We need food to survive. We don't care about health rules,"" Md Rafikul Islam of Boyrabari village under Belkuchi upazila told The Daily Star.

Md Abdur Rahim, relief and rehabilitation officer in Sirajganj district, however, said that a total of 172 flood shelters have already been opened in the five flood-hit upazilas of Sirajganj but nobody came to the flood-shelter and are instead living on embankment or staying in flood-hit houses.

""The flood-hit people are not following health rules anywhere in the five affected areas. We are trying to make them aware about the pandemic situation but nobody pays heed to it,"" the official said.

He also said they are not distributing items such as face masks, sanitiser, soap and other materials for health safety to the flood victims, adding that it is the people's own responsibility to manage the items.

Soldiers used boats to rescue residents as floodwaters flowed down streets in southern Japanese towns hit by heavy rains that were expanding across the region on Tuesday. At least 55 people have died and a dozen remain missing.

Pounding rain since late Friday in the southern region of Kyushu has triggered widespread flooding. More rain was predicted in Kyushu and the western half of Japan’s main island of Honshu as the rain front moved east.

In Fukuoka, on the northern part of Kyushu, soldiers waded through knee-high water pulling a boat carrying a mother, her 2-month-old baby, and two other residents.

“Good job!” one of the soldiers said as he held the baby up to his chest while the mother got off the boat, Asahi video showed. Several children wearing orange life vests over their wet T-shirts arrived on another boat.

An older woman told public broadcaster NHK that she started walking down the road to evacuate, but floodwater rose quickly to her neck. Another woman said, “I was almost washed away and had to grab a electrical pole.”

The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said 49 victims were from riverside towns in Kumamoto prefecture. Another victim was a woman in her 80s found inside her flooded home in another prefecture.

About 3 million residents were advised to evacuate across Kyushu, Japan’s third-largest island.

Tens of thousands of army troops, police, and other rescue workers mobilized from around the country worked their way through mud and debris in the hardest-hit riverside towns along the Kuma River. Rescue operations have been hampered by the floodwater and continuing harsh weather.

Japan is at high risk of heavy rain in early summer when wet and warm air from the East China Sea flows into a seasonal rain front above the country. In July 2018, more than 200 people, about half of them in Hiroshima, died from heavy rain and flooding in southwestern Japan.

In Kuma village in Kumamoto prefecture, dozens of residents took shelter under a roofed structure in a park with no walls or floor. They sat on blue tarps spread on the dirt ground, with no partitions. The village office’s electricity and communications had been cut.

Among the fatalities were 14 residents of a nursing home next to the Kuma River, known as the “raging river” because it is joined by another river just upstream and is prone to flooding. Its embankment collapsed, letting water gush into the nursing home.

They have submerged large parts of the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve, Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, and Manas National Park. Floods are an annual feature in the state. Apart from incessant and heavy rainfall during the monsoon, there are natural and man-made factors that contribute to this. With a large basin area spanning China, India, Bangladesh and Bhutan, the Brahmaputra brings with it huge quantities of water and silt, leading to erosion and floods in Assam. In addition, because of the region’s earthquake-prone nature, the river is not stable. The man-made problems include dams (which destroy the fragile ecology), deforestation in catchment areas leading to increase in sediment load, embankments, and growing habitation along the banks and sandbars. These restrict the space for the excess river water to spread. When rainfall is heavy, the river breaches the embankments and destroys habitations along the banks and on the sandbars.

It is time the central and the state governments prepare a long-term plan that goes beyond piecemeal measures like building embankments and dredging to control floods. They must opt for an integrated basin management plan that brings all the basin-sharing countries on board. Addressing the issues only in Assam when the flood strikes can’t be the solution — countries must come to an understanding about taking measures in the catchment areas. This becomes critical because the climate crisis, which is leading to intense rainfall in short periods of time, will only aggravate the existing challenges.","Mon, 06 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2020/07/06/Pictures/assam-floods-morigaon-dist_85ac5100-bf76-11ea-9738-294dc8afd766.jpg,"['response', 'state', 'embankments', 'integrated', 'river', 'water', 'plan', 'park', 'leading', 'editorial', 'rainfall', 'ht', 'evolve', 'floods', 'assam']",

“The flood situation is grim in Assam. More than a million people have been hit by this year’s rising waters,” Assam Disaster Management Authority’s state project coordinator, Pankaj Chakravarty, told AFP.

The state was first hit in mid-May when pre-monsoon rains arrived, causing floods that killed 11 people. Another 20 died in landslides caused by days of incessant downpours.

The floodwaters receded after a few weeks, only to rise again on 22 June at the start of the annual monsoon season.

Almost 29,000 people, mostly in rural regions, have been evacuated from their homes and brought to relief camps, officials said.

About 70% of Assam’s World Heritage-listed Kaziranga National Park – home to two-thirds of the world’s remaining one-horned rhinos – was submerged by the floods.

Officials said prices have been on the rise over the last few weeks due to a shortage of supply as many farmers lost their produce to rain and flooding.

According to them, this happens during the monsoon season every year.

But this year's situation has become unbearable for people on a low fixed income as the coronavirus outbreak has significantly slowed the country's economic activities.

At the capital's kitchen markets, prices of vegetables have shot up by Tk 5 to Tk 70 per kg in a week, according to statistics of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, Department of Agricultural Marketing (DAM) and Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB).

Take for example the rise in price of green chili. On June 30, it was sold for Tk 130 per kg, up from Tk 60 on June 22.

The prices of rice and broiler chicken have also gone up by Tk 1 to Tk 20 per kg. Egg, a major source of protein, was sold at Tk 108 per dozen on Tuesday, up from Tk 102 a week ago.

The soaring prices have left many families struggling to make ends meet.

Jahirul Islam, a teacher of a private college, said he used to spend an amount of between Tk 16,000 and Tk 18,000 per month on daily meals before the pandemic hit the country in March. He made some adjustments to his monthly expenses and brought the amount down to Tk 14,000 as his office could not pay him on time.

""I depend on the salary and private tuition fees for my income. My income from private tuition has stopped due to the pandemic. On the other hand, our college is not paying us regularly as academic activities remain suspended,"" he said.

He said he was using his savings now to meet the expenses, but he was still finding it difficult to cover the expenses as the prices of essentials keep on rising.

Hasibur Rahman, a hardware trader in the capital's Karwan Bazar, said his sales have dropped significantly due to the decline in construction works.

""But my family's demand for food remains unchanged. God only knows what the future holds,"" he said.

In the week between June 22-30, the price of beef has dropped by Tk 50 to Tk 550. The prices per kg of cardamom, cumin and cinnamon has dropped by Tk 400, Tk 20 and Tk 10 respectively. On Tuesday, these items were sold for Tk 4,000, Tk 400 and Tk 430 a kg.

According to DAM, vegetables sold in Dhaka city are mostly brought from Keraniganj upazila, Narsingdi, Cumilla and some northern districts.

The DAM's senior agriculture marketing officer in Cumilla, Mohammed Zakareya, said vegetables were damaged due to heavy rain in recent weeks and that ultimately disrupted the supply.

""Vegetables like papaya, bitter gourd, and snake gourd are sold for Tk 35 to Tk 60 per kg in retail markets in Cumilla,"" he added.

The DAM's market investigator in Munshiganj, Shariful Islam, said most of the district's low-lying areas, where vegetables are grown, went under water in recent weeks.

""In fact, vegetables are now being brought to Munshiganj from Dhaka's Shyambazar. This has led to a shortage of vegetables in the markets of the capital,"" he said.

Shovan Kumar Dhar, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) in Narsingdi, said shortage of vegetables are seen at local markets during the monsoon season every year.

""Vegetables grown in summer are damaged due to rain and flooding. On the other hand, we have run out of winter vegetables. That's why there is a shortage of supply at markets, which caused the prices to rise,"" he added.

Dhar said farmers would be able to grow new vegetables once the flood water recedes. There will be a shortage of vegetables in the market until that crop is harvested, he told The Daily Star.

India’s southwesterly monsoon has lashed the western parts of the country with heavy and persistent rain, causing widespread disruption and leaving roads and buildings flooded.

India’s financial capital, Mumbai, was badly hit with the rising waters causing large traffic jams.

People were seen wading through knee-deep waters while motorists had to take extra care on their journeys.

Until Sunday morning, the Santacruz neighbourhood in Mumbai had received a staggering 427mm of rain in 24 hours. It was 133mm in the previous 24 hours.

July is the city’s wettest month with an average rainfall of 819mm. The first five days of the new month has already seen 675mm of rain.

The wet weather is expected to move out of Maharashtra state into southern and central Gujarat over the next few days.

However, the India Meteorological Department said more heavy rain is likely across Mumbai and the surrounding areas for much of the week ahead.

Warnings have also been issued advising people to stay away from the coast.

At least seven people died on Thursday in flash floods during torrential rains which pummelled Ivory Coast’s Abidjan for two days.

This comes less than two weeks after 13 people were killed by a landslide nearby.

On Friday, the country’s meteorological services warned more rain was expected through the weekend.

The administrative head of the Abidjan area, Vincent Toh Bi Irie, said on Facebook that “in some places, the rainfall could reach 300 millimetres (12 inches) today, or six times the threshold for a critical alert”.

He urged residents not to go to regions where there is a risk of flooding and told people in areas prone to landslides to leave.

The West African nation is in the middle of its April to end of October rainy season which sometimes causes deadly floods and landslides.

On Thursday, Abidjan’s weak drainage system was quickly overwhelmed.

Major thoroughfares were flooded and cars and debris were swept away. Residents in low-lying homes were forced to seek safety.

Amankou Gabin, the head of the civil protection unit, said the situation was made worse by poor construction over the years.

The MEA's assertion comes days after Bihar's Water Resources Minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said repair of embankments along the Indo-Nepal border in the state has been adversely affected as barricades put up by the neighbouring country is hindering personnel from crossing over to complete the work.

Asked about the issue at a media briefing, MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said there is already an existing bilateral mechanism between India and Nepal with regard to flooding and inundation works.

""The embankment and anti-erosion works have already commenced,"" he said, adding that works are already underway on some of the major rivers along the India-Nepal border,

""Both sides are coordinating on a real time basis to minimise the damage due to flooding and inundation in this monsoon season,"" Srivastava said.

On the issue of Nepal amending its Constitution to update its new political map featuring areas which India maintains belong to it, Srivastava said, ""We have made our position clear on the issue and would not like to add anything.""

India had termed the move as ""untenable"" and asserted that artificial enlargement of territorial claims by Nepal is not based on historical facts or evidence.

Asked about reports of problems in trade and supplies at the Kakarbhitta border point, the MEA spokesperson said trade and supplies are going on without any hindrance between the two countries, including at the Kakarbhitta-Panitanki border.

""The two countries have extensive trade relations. Our bilateral trade is growing despite the lockdown. In fact in the month of May it surpassed USD 300 million,"" Srivastava said.

""Despite the present challenging times of Covid-19, we have facilitated continuous and smooth flow of trade and supply of essential goods to Nepal,"" he asserted.

Asked about the proposal to amend Nepal's Citizenship Act that would require a foreign woman married to a Nepali national to wait seven years for getting naturalised citizenship, Srivastava said, ""We have seen the reports on this.

The Teesta River rose alarmingly at Dalia point of Nilphamari district on Friday morning near the Teesta barrage, inundating low-lying areas of Dimla and Jaldhaka upazila.

Heavy rain in the last 24 hours in the Teesta basin caused a heavy onrush of water from upstream, and the water level was 20 centimetres above the danger mark in the morning.

There are government-produced maps showing 8.7 million homes and properties at significant flood risk—and it turns out those may have underestimated the amount of real estate at risk by 67%. Or, in other words, an additional 6 million properties face a significant risk of flood.

Before these individual property scores were available, there was no easy way for an average homeowner or buyer to understand the flood risk associated with specific properties. That’s particularly problematic because climate change is causing flood risk to increase; there are more extreme rain events and coastal flooding than there used to be.

Lenders With the Best Climate Data Will Be in a Position to Discriminate: Viewpoint Top 100 Cities: 6 in 10 Homes in High-Risk Flood Zones Lack Flood Insurance Climate Change Is Expected to Trigger Extreme Waves and Coastal Erosion

In theory, accurate signals about real flood risk will help correct some of the irrational and expensive behaviors we’ve seen— like continued real-estate development in high-risk shore communities. It might also help more people understand what’s at stake if we as a society don’t curb our greenhouse gas emissions.

But transparency also has its downsides.

Rachel Cleetus, policy director for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, conducted research on risk of coastal property flood in 2018, complete with data on how the risk affected each individual house. She and her colleagues considered publishing their findings but decided against it. Instead, they published the risk information by zip code. Exposing higher flood risk would likely translate to lower property values, and Cleetus worried about singling out unsuspecting homeowners.

Some might imagine shoreline communities as the province of second homes for rich people, but in places such as Texas and Louisiana—coasts where risk is already high and projected to get much worse—there are often low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and communities of color. These are the people least able to afford private insurance and most likely to face financial run if their mortgages go underwater.

Cleetus points out that individuals didn’t create the problem of climate change and therefore shouldn’t have to bear its financial consequences individually. The real solutions, she says, must be collective actions such as restoring wetlands to blunt storm surges or reducing total greenhouse gas emissions.

It’s unfair to pin the problem on a few without public policies to moderate the fallout.”The market is a brutal and sometimes inequitable tool,” she says.

Jesse Keenan, a real-estate professor at Tulane University, sees another problem. Banks and investors are already beginning to abandon communities with a high-risk of flooding, a process he labels “blue-lining.” He stresses the term specifically because he believes it is linked to “red-lining,” the process by which banks exclude Black and other minority communities from home loans.

Because historically red-lined communities offered no tax base, they often didn’t benefit from top-notch drainage and sewer systems or other public works projects. That dynamic continues to haunt neglected neighborhoods today in the form of increased vulnerability to flooding. “Red-lining lives with us today in the form of degraded infrastructure in marginalized communities,” Keenan explains.

Poor infrastructure begets more flooding, which begets worse flood scores, which begets less investment. So a vicious circle of disinvestment drives a community to the brink. That’s why Keenan thinks the new flood maps could have a profound but not entirely salutary effect. “Banks are already using climate data to make investment decisions and this information could accelerate further marginalization of moderate and low-income communities,” he warns. “And I think we have to stand back and understand that the market made be maladapted to deal with this.”

Rescuers are racing against time to save people stranded by heavy floods and landslides that have devastated southwestern Japan and left dozens dead.

Japan’s Meteorological Agency (JMA) on Tuesday issued its second-highest emergency warning for heavy rain and landslides over vast swaths of the Kyushu region, which has been pounded by downpours since late on Friday.

At least 50 deaths have so far been confirmed but officials expect the toll to rise, with more than a dozen people reported missing.

“We are racing against time,” Yutaro Hamasaki, an official in the hardest-hit region of Kumamoto, told AFP news agency.

“We have not set any deadline or time to end the operation, but we really need to speed up our search as time is running out. We won’t give up to the end.”

Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga Yoshihide said on Tuesday that the government may declare the torrential rain an “extraordinary disaster” to enable victims to receive special support, according to Japanese public media broadcaster NHK.

He also told reporters heavy rain was forecast through Wednesday in wide parts of eastern and western Japan, while the JMA warned “risks are rising” nationwide.

Suga hints at 'extraordinary disaster' declaration https://t.co/JqisOu7OSq — NHK WORLD News (@NHKWORLD_News) July 7, 2020

In Kyushu, tens of thousands of army troops, police and other rescue workers mobilised from around the country worked their way through mud and debris in the hardest-hit riverside towns along the Kuma River.

So far, at least 22 hospitals in Kumamoto, Kagoshima and Fukuoka prefectures were flooded or had no electricity or water, NHK reported.

At an elementary school in Omuta city, dozens of children and their teachers spent the night sheltering on the upper floor of the building after floodwaters inundated the ground level.

“Shoe cupboards on the group floor were swept away and shoes were floating around,” an 11-year-old girl told a local newspaper after rescuers arrived.

“Some children were sobbing because they were worried about not being able to get home and were afraid of the heavy rain.”

Kentaro Oishi, who owns a rafting business in the hot springs resort of Hitoyoshi City, said emergency services drafted him in to rescue stranded locals.

“I have 20 years of rafting experience, but I never dreamed” of rowing the boat through the city, he told AFP.

Despite Japan’s confirmed coronavirus figures being fairly low – almost 20,000 cases and fewer than 1,000 deaths – the outbreak has further complicated the evacuation efforts.

Hundreds of thousands of people are under non-compulsory orders to take refuge but the need to maintain physical distancing has reduced capacity at shelters.

In Yatsushiro city, authorities converted the local sports gymnasium into a shelter, with families separated by cardboard walls to prevent the spread of the virus.

According to local media, some people were preferring to sleep in their cars rather than risk possible infection at a shelter.

Even as Covid-19 spreads like wildfire across South Asia, farmers are planting the summer crop despite grappling with higher input costs, labour issues and the threat of floods

The southwest monsoon has arrived in most parts of South Asia and farmers in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal have started planting the summer crop. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected the already distressed agriculture sector in these countries in different ways, and the stakes couldn’t be higher for farmers in this cropping season.

Covid-19 has already afflicted more than a million people in the four countries, with infections rising fast in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, latest data shows. South Asia has taken a beating from the lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of the virus, and with growth shrinking in the industrial and services sectors, hope is now pinned on adequate monsoon rainfall and farmers gathering a good harvest to breathe life back into the battered economies.

Although the share of agriculture in national GDPs varies from 25% in Nepal to 13% in Bangladesh, farming provides a livelihood to the vast majority of the countries’ working populations.

As the pandemic-forced lockdowns disrupted labour mobility and vehicular transportation, farmers have struggled to harvest and sell the winter crop, leading to widespread losses across the subcontinent. “In the past few months, I have fed vegetables from the farm to the livestock as I couldn’t sell them,” said Ishwar Acharya, a farmer from Morang district in eastern Nepal.

Farm inputs

As the summer sowing season approached, scarcities in farm inputs were reported, and prices rose. “Cost of seeds in Jharkhand and Bihar have increased by as much as 15% to 25%, which has led to difficulties for small and marginal farmers,” said Ranchi-based Ashok Kumar of Transform Rural India Foundation (TRIF), a non-profit that works in the poorest states of India.

Big farmers in India’s breadbasket in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh are better insulated from such price shocks as they are able to place bulk orders in advance, said New Delhi-based Satyabrata Acharyya of Professional Assistance for Development Action (Pradan), a rural grassroots organisation.

Prices of farm inputs have risen in southern India as well. However, farmer producer organisations have intervened significantly in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka so that cultivators have not been short on seeds, according to Ravindra Adusimilli of Hyderabad-based Watershed Support Services and Activities Network (WASSAN).

In Pakistan, prices of farm inputs have increased significantly, farmers said. The country imports large amounts of chemicals for fertilisers and pesticides, and the supply chain disruption caused by the pandemic has led to price increases. This will eat into the margins of smallholder and middle farmers, according to Waqas Gondal, a farmer from the southern part of Punjab province.

The government has, however, provided some financial assistance to farmers to buy inputs. Cultivators will also soon get relief in energy costs, which account for 30% of all inputs, according to Khalid Jamil of the National Agriculture Research Centre (NARC).

In Nepal, there is an acute scarcity of fertilisers. The Himalayan nation imports nearly all of its chemical fertilisers, mostly from the Middle East and China via India’s ports. Some 50,000 tonnes of fertilisers are stuck in the port of Kolkata and 21,000 tonnes in Kandla’s port in Gujarat, according to Nepal’s farm ministry.

“It will take more than a month to bring the stuck fertilisers,” the ministry said in a press statement. The government aims to sell nearly half a million tonnes of subsidised fertilisers to farmers this year to tide them over the Covid-19 crisis.

“If you ask a supplier for urea, the answer would be, we don’t have it now. If you ask for Diammonium Phosphate (DAP), you would be told to wait a couple of weeks,” said Acharya, the farmer from eastern Nepal. “Only about 25% is provided, and that too after queuing up for two weeks at least.”

Farmers at receiving end

“The worst part is that farmers cannot determine their prices; the middleman does that,” said Aamer Hayat Bhandara, a farmer from Pakpattan district of Punjab province in Pakistan. “And the government has a terrible role in this. It gives zero security to farmers.” Instead of giving farmers a little bit of extra money during the crisis, the government opened the market for importers, he alleged.

To add to the woes, the huge migrant labour force that works in cities returned to their villages and, in the absence of gainful employment, used up precious savings that would have been invested in cultivating the summer crop.

In Pakistan, expectations of farmers who grow rice, corn, cotton and sugar during the monsoon are running low. “Take cotton, our major crop that runs our entire textile industry. In this fiscal year, nothing has been kept aside for cotton,” said Bhandara. “There is no development even though the prime minister had been willing to revive the crop once upon a time.” Even the target of 2.8% of the national budget for agricultural development this fiscal year is lower than usual, he said.

In India and Pakistan, a plague of locusts has further decimated crops. Authorities haven’t ruled out the threat of locusts swarming again in July.

Labour issues

The lockdown in South Asia led to a mass exodus of migrant labourers to villages, which resulted in labour scarcity in some areas and excess in others.

In the poorer states of India such as Jharkhand in the east, which is home to a large number of migrant labourers, the recent influx has led to a surplus. Villages in Bangladesh and Nepal, too, are flush with returned migrants.

While this is good news for landholders, the same cannot be said of temporary farmhands because wages have crashed. In Bangladesh, for instance, farm wages have been rising steadily in the past decade, said Abdur Razzak, a farmer from the northern district of Rangpur. “It was tough to get adequate numbers of them when it was required,” he said.

The situation has dramatically changed in recent weeks, according to Razzak. “Many of them who migrated from the village to urban areas are returning to villages, so wages have gone down,” he said.

The same holds true in the poorer provinces in eastern India, said Kumar of TRIF.

On the other hand, farmers with large landholdings in the breadbaskets of India and Pakistan are facing a labour shortage. In the Punjab province of India, for instance, farmers’ groups are ferrying farmhands back to the state. Since paddy sowing depends heavily on manual labour, the shortage due to the earlier exodus has led to a rise in wages, which will impact profit margins, farmers say.

Fear of floods

Despite the farming lifeline the monsoon extends to South Asia, it also exacts a heavy price during floods. Although the 2020 southwest monsoon has just about started, heavy rains are already flooding large parts of Assam, Meghalaya, northern Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sikkim and Nepal. Some 50 people have been killed in these parts of South Asia, including 23 in Assam and 18 in Nepal.

Farmers in flood-prone Bangladesh are bracing themselves. “In case of Aman, I have been cultivating flood-resistant varieties for two years,” said Akram Hossain, a farmer from Lalmonirhat district in the Teesta river basin. Aman is the principal paddy variety grown in Bangladesh and eastern India at this time of the year.

Farmers in the Indian state of Bihar are less prepared to face floods than they are in normal years. The Covid-19 pandemic has delayed flood-control preparations, with nearly 30% of embankment repair and anti-erosion works incomplete. The state government has just started a Twitter handle through which it is inviting citizens to inform the authorities if any embankment is breached.

According to the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE), at least 1,000 hectares of land in 20 char (land area emerging from riverbed) areas of the three upazilas have been brought under peanut cultivation this year.

Of it, over 200-hectare peanut land have been inundated due to the rise of water level in the Teesta.

Rafiqul Islam of Char Biswanath under Kaunia upazila said he cultivated peanut on a two-acre land and expected a good yield this season.

""But, half of the peanut field has already gone under water. Many farmers of the area collected peanut from under the water to minimise their loss,"" he said, adding that water level of the Teesta started rapidly swelling on June 20.

Usually the Teesta swells in July, but this year it happened early due to heavy rain across the region, which caused massive losses to the crop, local farmers said.

Through peanut farming, the needy people of the 20 char areas of three upazilas of Rangpur have changed their fortune.

It is possible to produce 25 maunds (a maund = 40 kg) of peanut in an acre and a kg of peanut sells at Tk 80, said the farmers.

Many farmers harvested the peanut in premature condition as the water level of the Teesta started rising, said Sirajul Islam of Dhusmara Char.

​""We are more worried as wholesale buyers from other districts are not coming this season to buy the peanut due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic,"" he said.

Dr Sarwarul Haq, deputy director of DAE in Rangpur, said farmers are facing losses due to the sudden surge of water level of the Teesta.","Mon, 29 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/teesta-floods-peanut-fields-rangpur.jpg?itok=k6wEtoQD,"['peanut', 'fields', 'water', 'rangpur', 'upazilas', 'areas', 'land', 'char', 'farmers', 'floods', 'teesta', 'level', 'swelling']",

The water level of Jamuna is 28cm above the danger level, Dhaleshwari is 43cm above danger level, and Jhenai River is 21cm above the danger level

Rainfall and upstream flow of water has caused a few of the rivers in Tangail to overflow.

The water level of Jamuna is 28cm above the danger level, Dhaleshwari is flowing 43cm above danger level, and Jhenai River is flowing 21cm above the danger level as of 9am Monday.

Many riverside areas of Tangail Sadar, Bhuapur and Kalihati upazilas have been flooded. At the same time, river erosion is also continuing.

The Water Development Board has informed that the water level will rise even further.

The Executive Engineer of Tangail Water Development Board told this correspondent that the water levels of Tangail’s Jamuna, Pungli, Jhenai, Bongshai, and Dhaleshwari have risen while Jamuna and Dhaleshwari are flowing above the danger level.

He said: “We are fearing that with abating water levels the erosion may increase. We are working to prevent the river erosion in important areas of the erosion prone zones.”

Health experts warn of grave consequences, even death, from unprescribed treatment

At a time when no proven treatment for novel coronavirus Covid-19 has been found, numerous fake and unverified treatments are now being spread on social media, influencing people to take random medicines without consulting a licensed physician.

Health experts are deeply concerned over the impact of such ""DIY"" (Do it yourself) treatments that can have grave consequences, even leading to death.

People become more inclined to take a medicine when they learn on social media that the drug is “effective” against Covid-19 and available in the country, but doctors or hospitals refuse to prescribe it, the experts said.

Moreover, those who have recovered from the infection also suggest self-treatment among family members, relatives, friends, co-worker, and on social media.

These home remedies also include unorthodox methods related to diagnosis and disinfection, gargling and inhalation, temperature and radiation, religious and occult methods, recipes of herbs and spices, among others.

They also said that as some 80% to 85% of Covid-19 patients recover without taking any medical help, many now believe that these fake or unproven remedies work effectively against the virus.

The experts also pointed out that for any disease, a person must consult a licensed physician as the type of treatment and medication differ from person to person considering their health conditions and disease history, or the consequences may be fatal.

“As almost 85% of patients have recovered naturally, it cannot be confirmed which medications work and which don’t,” Sir Salimullah Medical College Mitford Hospital Director Brig Gen Kazi Md Rashid Un Nabi told Dhaka Tribune.

Although Ivermectin, Doxycycline, Hydroxychloroquine, or Remdesivir have cured some patients, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that these have not yet been proven to be a cure for the disease. Still, very little is known about the disease. It will take time to know the impact of the medicines now being provided at hospitals, he added.

“Some are taking Homeopathy or Ayurveda therapy as alternative medicine. But, do not take medicines such as antibiotics without consulting a registered doctor. If you have a fever, you can take medicine for fever and if you have a cough, then you can take medicine for it. But do not randomly take any medicine. If you need to take any other medicine, you must consult a doctor,” he warned.

Health experts also warned that fake or unproven medical products and methods on social media that claim to diagnose, prevent, or cure Covid-19, may contain other ingredients that might cause further harm to one’s health.

Regarding the issue, WHO has requested member countries to immediately alert them if any fake medicine or other falsified products are identified.

Dr Mujibur Rahman, head of the Department of Medicine at Dhaka Medical College, said: “Patients are being admitted to the hospital at the last moment after following the unproven treatment, which has had a bad effect.”

“At the same time, many of them follow social media and do not go for the Covid-19 test. Later, they go to the doctor or hospital after their conditions worsens,” he added.

“If someone is feeling sick, that person should maintain self-isolation and call a doctor or the national helpline instead of looking for remedies from others or social media,” Dr Mujibur advised.

However, there is no specific data available on the number of people who have fallen ill after taking medicines without doctor's consultation during the pandemic.

Talking to Dhaka Tribune, Dr ABM Abdullah, former dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) said: “There is no proven treatment or drug yet for Covid-19, but people are taking unverified medicines after taking suggestions from social media or other such media tools. People run after rumours and unscientific methods more.”

“The key factor is maintaining social distancing, following health guidelines and using personal safety products to avoid a Covid-19 infection,” Dr Abdullah, who is also the personal physician of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

Similarly, Bangladesh Medical Research Council (BMRC) Director Dr Mahmood-uz-Jahan said: “Which drugs work against Covid-19 is yet to be confirmed. But many people are risking it all by taking drugs because these are widely available in our country. But in foreign nations, you cannot buy drugs without a doctor's prescription.”

“All these treatments were proved wrong. Therefore, the misuse of these drugs must be stopped, said BMRC director.","Thu, 09 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2020/07/watermarked/335260/1594308508925coronavirus-dhaka-reuters-1594308142908.jpg,"['unverified', 'doctor', 'medical', 'medicine', 'media', 'diy', 'covid19', 'taking', 'social', 'flood', 'experts', 'medicines', 'disease', 'remedies']",

On January 23 2020, the city was overwhelmed by an explosion of COVID-19 cases, after which an unprecedented lockdown was imposed on the city’s 11 million residents.

As of now, eight people have lost their lives to the floods. The fury of the calamity hasn’t spared the supermarkets, shops, and the streets. Rainstorm warnings have been issued for the next 31 days. And people of Wuhan have been asked to stay in again.

However, is the flooding natural? Reports suggest that the floods are a direct consequence of a heavy discharge of water from reservoirs.

368 kilometres away from Wuhan lies the Three Gorges Dam in the district of Yiling, which has been releasing floodwaters from its spillways.

According to Chinese authorities, the dam is on the verge of collapse, mandating the release of water. Chinese activists are now claiming that the opening of spillways is intentional.

Jennifer Zeng, an activist recently claimed that this move was undertaken intentionally, and that Chinese authorities are deliberately flooding cities in the Hubei province to purge out the evidence against China and its role in the coronavirus pandemic.

This claim is false; the video has been doctored to replace a green trash container with the Buddha statue, and actually shows heavy rain in Spain's Canary Islands in 2018.



The video was published here on Twitter on May 23, 2020. It has been viewed more than 55,100 times.

The seven-second clip shows a large Buddha statue being washed away down a street as cars pass by.

Torrential rain and flooding was reported across much of the Chinese city of Guangzhou in May 2020. The rainfall was reported by Chinese state newspaper China Daily and the state media company China Global Television Network.

The video was also shared here on Instagram with a claim that it was taken in the Chinese city of Chongqing and here on Youtube beside a claim that it showed the aftermath of a tsunami in Indonesia.

However, these claims are false.

A reverse Google Image search of keyframes extracted from the video found an earlier version of the footage published here on the Spanish forecast website tiempo.com on October 25, 2018.

The report's Spanish headline translates to English as: ""The effects of DANA in the Canary Islands"".

DANA is an acronym of ""Depresión Aislada en Niveles Altos"", which is a meteorological phenomenon that results in heavy rain and prolonged storms in Spain.

The Canary Islands is a Spanish archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean.

The YouTube video embedded in the report, titled ""The effects of heavy rain in the Canary Islands"", features a green trash container being swept away -- not a Buddha statue as seen in the misleading posts.

64,64,FL-2020-000161-BGD,"Whether Public or Private, Flood Insurance Is a Must, Experts Say - Insurance Journal",https://www.insurancejournal.com/magazines/mag-features/2020/07/06/574236.htm,"Tropical Storm Imelda hit the Texas Gulf Coast on Sept. 17, 2019, as a fairly low-level tropical storm but that doesn’t mean it was an inexpensive one in terms of property damage, especially with regard to flooding.

Imelda drenched Southeast Texas for three days, saturating some areas with as much as 43 inches of rain. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) paid out around $738 million on 11,000 claims from Imelda, according to Butch Kinerney, branch chief, National Flood Insurance Marketing and Outreach, for the NFIP. By contrast, the NFIP paid out $737 million on 16,000 claims from Hurricane Florence, a category 1 storm that made landfall on the coast of North Carolina in September 2018.

Kinerney, moderator of a panel discussion, Communicating the Value of Flood Insurance Throughout the Hurricane Season, as part of the National Hurricane Conference held virtually in early June, said while 2019 was a relatively quiet year flood-wise, the NFIP still paid out $1.47 billion on 35,004 claims. In 2018, approximately 42,500 claims resulted a $1.53 billion payout for the program.

The NFIP has “about 5 million flood insurance policies in force nationally. We are in every state, every territory, every tribal nation. We are in more than 23,000 participating communities nationwide. We cover $1.3 trillion in assets, all against flood. About 95% of our policies are residential and about 5% of our policies are nonresidential,” Kinerney said.

As of early June 2020, the NFIP had received 3,143 claims representing a little more than $44 million in payments to policyholders.

It doesn’t have to take a tropical storm or a hurricane to generate enough water to cause a flood event, however. Heavy rains, dam failures, excessive property development in highly populated areas, and even construction projects that temporarily alter water drainage routes can be catalysts for movement of water on the ground that results in property damage. That’s why it’s so important to be insured against flood damage, Kinerney said.

Many property owners are unaware that the standard homeowners policy does not offer coverage for flood damage, said panelist Mark Friedlander, director of Corporate Communications for the Insurance Information Institute (I.I.I.). Water that leaks through a roof or falls from a faulty air conditioning system, for instance, would be covered but “water that comes from the ground up and floods your home requires flood insurance,” he said.

Of the more than 200,000 homes that flooded during Hurricane Harvey, three-quarters of them did not have flood coverage, Friedlander added.

“It’s a very difficult conversation to have with a survivor or homeowner when they didn’t take that opportunity to purchase flood insurance,” said Jason Hunter, branch chief, Floodplain Management and Insurance FMI Branch of FEMA Region IV Atlanta.

There are various types of policies available through the NFIP, and they are generally affordable, Hunter said. The program offers residential coverage, nonresidential or commercial coverage, content coverage for renters, and condominium coverage. A condominium association can purchase a policy for each unit in the building and the people who occupy the units can purchase content coverage.

“For residential coverage, the limits are $250,000 for the building and $100,000 for the contents. For nonresidential structures, it’s $500,000 for the building and $500,000 for the content,” he said.

“There are various factors that go into the rating of a policy,” Hunter said. But someone located outside of a special flood hazard area right now can get a preferred risk policy from the NFIP for around four hundred to five hundred dollars. “When you get into the various [designated] flood zones … that amount will probably go up,” he said.

But the NFIP is not the only game in town. The private flood insurance market is an emerging one and “everyday they’re offering more and more coverages,” said Caitlin Connor, flood strategy coordinator with Johnson & Johnson Insurance in Tampa/St. Petersburg, Florida. The risk modeling systems used by the private flood market differ from that of the NFIP, which relies heavily on flood zone maps. Private flood insurers are “using more modern technology to identify risk. … In a few clicks now agents can get a rate … that’s something new,” Connor said.

“When it comes to coverages, the limits can be higher,” she added. Not every home is valued at $250,000, which is the limit for the NFIP residential policy. Houses can cost much more than that to replace. In the private market, coverage can go as high as $5 million, including content replacement costs, she said.

The private flood market can provide more robust coverage with higher limits and it can be less expensive than the NFIP. “But the private market is not trying to take all of the risk and there are clients out there … that should stay with the NFIP,” Connor said. For instance, policyholders with NFIP subsidies could lose by moving to the private market.

“One of the other advantages that consumers are seeing with private market flood insurance is a less than a 30-day waiting period [which is required by the NFIP]. That’s another issue that consumers don’t understand,” said Friedlander. “You can’t go out and buy an NFIP policy for a storm that’s coming this weekend. But there are some private insurers that have a much [shorter] grace period for the policy to take effect … that has been an advantage for the market.”

For some private insurers, the waiting period may be seven to 10 days, for others, 14 days.

“So there is a possibility to get coverage sooner, but it can’t wait until the storm watch, the hurricane watch is underway, because not only is there a waiting period, there’s also going to be a moratorium on making changes to a property policy,” Friedlander said.

A 2019 report on the private flood insurance market by Wells Media’s Research & Trends division found private flood insurers reported total direct premiums written of $681 million in 2018, an increase of $51 million over 2017. The majority of the growth was in commercial flood insurance.

The Wells Media report shows that 30% of the U.S. private flood market is written in seven Gulf and Atlantic coast states identified by CoreLogic as having the highest potential for storm surge damage: Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia.

In a typical year, the average loss per property for flood is about $45,000, I.I.I.’s Friedlander said. For Hurricane Harvey, which devastated coastal Texas in 2017, the average flood loss was nearly $117,000 per property. So, ask homeowners: Can they “afford $45,000, let alone $117,000, versus spending an average of $700 premium for NFIP policy?”

Conditions in evacuation centers inevitably fall short of those in nursing homes designed for old-age care. For the frailest patients, the moves can cause injury or destabilize long-term care plans.

Facility operators have mixed feelings about evacuations, said Hajime Kagiya, a professor of disaster management at Atomi University in Tokyo. “They have to be mindful of the health conditions of the residents as well as choosing a place to evacuate to,” he said. “So they tend to take their time in making the decision to evacuate.”

The Japanese government issues standardized evacuation protocols, but they do not take into account the unique characteristics or terrain in different parts of the country, said Professor Tsukahara of Kyushu University. In rural areas, many small villages are isolated and populated by mostly aging residents, with few local resources to help with disaster planning or, in the event of a crisis, to assist with evacuation or rescue.

In the case of the Senjuen nursing home, Aki Goto, its director, told The Kumamoto Nichinichi Shimbun, a local newspaper, that she had been more concerned about mudslides than flooding. When the waters came, she added, the caregivers could not move quickly enough to move all the residents upstairs.

Six of the workers were on call the night of the floods last weekend, the newspaper reported. That still left each caregiver in charge of more than 10 aging residents, some of whom were unable to walk without help. Even with the aid of local volunteers, they could not bring everyone to safety upstairs as the floodwaters rapidly rose and deluged the ground floor.

According to Shigemitsu Sakoda, 53, the president of Land Earth, a local rafting and outdoor sports company who assisted with the rescue effort at Senjuen, only the caretakers and two local volunteer firefighters were moving residents when Mr. Sakoda arrived to help around noon on Saturday.

“It’s a really tough job for such a small number of people to carry up those who cannot walk to the second floor,” Mr. Sakoda said in a telephone interview. By the time troops from the Japan Self-Defense Forces arrived to rescue the nursing home residents from the roof, some had already died below.","Fri, 10 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/08/world/08japan-flood-visual1-asiabriefing/08japan-flood-visual1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"['aging', 'university', 'senjuen', 'residents', 'evacuation', 'nursing', 'local', 'japans', 'help', 'small', 'sakoda', 'change', 'walk', 'society', 'deadly', 'climate', 'combination']",

The NWS reported those storms produced rainfall totals approaching 5 inches in some areas, with some area totals exceeding 8 inches.

Wisconsin officials said flash flooding made some roads impassable.

Police in Baldwin, Wisconsin, said parts of Highway 63 were dangerous and should not be used. The St. Croix County Sheriff's Office said at least five drivers standing on the roofs of their cars were rescued from rushing water on the highway earlier.

Authorities said some water rescues and evacuations took place in the community, including the evacuation of at least eight families from houses near a creek in Baldwin who were taken to a nearby community center.

At one point, there were as many as 54 road closures in St. Croix County. Some roads continue to reamin clsed Monday night.

By providing farmers with high quality rice seed now, in time for the aman season crop, we will be helping them get through this difficult period, as well as provide for the overall population food security needs.”

The Department of Agricultural Extenstion (DAE) and FAO selected farmers from two sub-districts, Ukhiya and Teknaf. Staff from the two organizations, with support from government (Union Parishad) representatives, will provide a 10 kg packet of seed to each farmer, plus a hygiene kit. They will be delivered door to door to ensure maximum safety from COVID-19 transmission. More than 7 000 of the selected beneficiaries have also benefited from other FAO programmes, including farmer field schools.

“FAO has been the key partner of DAE in efforts to enhance food security in Cox’s Bazar through distribution of seeds, agro-machinery, and training thousands of farmers”, said Abul Kashem, Deputy Director, DAE, Cox’s Bazar.

Md. Nikaruzzaman Chowdhury, Ukhiya Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO), said: “This is a timely intervention to achieve a Government priority in line with the Prime Minister’s directive to utilize land to increase food production in the district.”

The seed, sourced from the Bangladesh Agriculture Development Cooperation, was inspected in order to ensure that it met FAO’s global standard. FAO and DAE will provide technical support and skills development for the farmers to promote best practices from cultivation until harvest.

FAO estimates that the entire distribution will be enough to plant 8 000 hectares and produce a total yield of 37 000 tonnes – about a sixth of the area’s typical aman (monsoon season) rice yield.

Cox’s Bazar has an estimated 236 000 farmer households who cultivate 89 398 hectares. The region produces a surplus of food, mainly because of its rice production. Nearly 70 percent of rice farmers cultivate aman rice in the monsoon season.

FAO and DAE implemented the rice distribution initiative following a recent FAO study in which farmers said they faced difficulties buying high quality seeds because of COVID-19 and Cyclone Amphan. The report showed that agricultural supply chains in Cox’s Bazar were stable, although farmers faced several challenges including transportation of produce to market, labour shortages, and inadequate supply of some inputs.

The Government of Canada and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) funded the emergency initiative.","Thu, 02 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/report-images/FAO%20rice%20seed%20distribution%20%2810%29_web.jpg?itok=HFu2Xj7B,"['food', 'thousands', 'cyclone', 'covid19', 'seed', 'provides', 'amphan', 'dae', 'coxs', '000', 'bangladesh', 'farmers', 'rice', 'fao', 'provide', 'distribution']",

In May 2020, this ecologically sensitive region became one of the areas worst affected by Amphan as the landfall happened in this expanse.

Cyclone Amphan was much more destructive than its predecessors such as Aila and Bulbul, which occurred in 2009 and 2019. The wind speed was 240 km/hour compared to Aila and Bulbul at 120 km/hour and 155 km/hour respectively.

Due to Amphan, the biodiversity of this region has been affected by the loss of trees and mangroves.

West Bengal Chief Minister Ms. Mamata Banerjee stated that 1,200 km2 of a total of 4,263 km2 forest areas of Sundarbans were damaged.

According to the State Forest Department estimates, around 40 per cent of the mangroves were ravaged.

The cyclone has also affected turtles as this region is a breeding zone of a rare species (Batagur Baska), which is on the verge of extinction in some South Asian countries.

The local economy is disrupted, and there is a loss of indigenous livelihoods. After 32 embankments were breached, the paddy fields, the rivers, and the ponds are flooded with saline water, leaving the farmers in utter despair, and the plight of fisherfolks is unbearable.

Amphan impacted on indigenous people, the honey collectors who collect honey from beehives. But the farmers’ loss is enormous as the paddy fields become non-fertile for paddy cultivation for the next few years.

According to estimates by the Sundarbans Affairs Minister Mr. Manturam Pakhira, nearly 17,800 hectares of agricultural lands may have been damaged due to saline water entering the farms, and 1,08,000 farmers have been affected.

The threat to food security looms large when the dried crops, vegetables, trees, and freshwater fish are destroyed.

According to a study by Reddy et al. (2017), in the coastal areas, soil salinity is one of the significant constraints which affect paddy production, and they proposed that new varieties of paddy should be developed so that these will be more suitable to this kind of geographic location.

Padmanabhan (2019) mentioned that Indian scientists developed a new variety of paddy plant “Porteresia Coarctata” which is salt tolerant and can resist the salt concentration of up to 200 micromoles per litre.

As the local economy stands still at present and in under shock wondering how to bounce back, the local people do not have any purchasing power to procure essential food items.

We may not be able to avoid a famine soon if immediate action is not taken efficiently. The issues of loss of livelihood and threat to food security are intertwined, and the situation became miserable with the presence of Covid 19, which compelled many local people to return to this region with the hope of re-starting their livelihood.

However, with the blow of Amphan, their dreams are shattered, and they have lost whatever they had saved earlier with a lot of effort and self-sacrifice. On top of everything, they need to re-build their kutcha (mud brick) houses as the storm has already turned their homes into debris.

With no monetary support and no hope in farming, they are now in real distress. As the vast farmlands and rivers are flooded with seawater pushing the farmers and fisherfolks into utter despair, there is an urgent requirement of providing immediate relief to these people to save their livelihood.

The distress of people of Sundarbans cannot be neglected, as this is a hub of eco-tourism. We believe that they require support for short-run as well as long-run. In the short-run, they need instant cash transfer and supply of essential commodities for at least six months for their survival.

The long-run support can be in applying new technology to use the saline lands for paddy cultivation or the introduction of new salt resistant paddy crops. Besides funding from the State and the Central Government, the global networks for the conservation of biodiversity can be approached for financing.

Another way of generating funds can be by introducing a willingness to pay model for the preservation of the worlds’ largest mangrove forest of Sundarbans. As Sundarbans is a hub of ecology and biodiversity, the conservation of the archipelagos is the need of the hour.

Sundarbans being a cyclone prone area, strategies need to be built to combat cyclones’ after-effects. The embankments need to be maintained before an upcoming storm to reduce distress.

The first step to restore the local economy is to generate demand by transferring cash and investing money. The assistance of Rs 1,000 crore is already released from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) to West Bengal to restore the destruction created by cyclone Amphan.

Although the storm brought loss of livelihood and threat to food security, the problem can be solved with financial and technological support from the government.

To conclude, the most feasible way to bring back the local economy’s resilience is by instant cash transfer, the introduction of salt-resistant rice crop, and specific investment in land and fishing ponds.

In May 2020, the rise in COVID-19 transmissions in host and camp communities, coupled with Cyclone Amphan and the rescue of about 300 displaced people from Rakhine, from the Bay of Bengal and who were then taken to Bhasan Char, were the one of the concerns of humanitarian organizations. UN agencies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDRCS) with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Partner National Societies, have been collaborating with government counterparts in Cox’s Bazar district to intensify the preparedness and response actions on COVID-19 as well as Cyclone Amphan, and the effects of the emerging monsoon season. On 14 May, the camp settlement saw the first person testing positive for COVID-19. Up to 21 June, 2,053 people tested positive in Cox’s Bazar district, with a total of 45 cases recorded so far in the camp communities, and 56 cases recorded in host communities, only on 21 June, according to the Civil Surgeon Office. Amid the outbreak, Cyclone Amphan made landfall in Cox’s Bazar on 20 May, with a speed of 140 to 160 km per hour, causing damage to shelters and livelihoods in host and camp communities.

PMO Integrated Preparedness and Response to COVID-19 (up to 18 June)

The number of COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh crossed the 100,000 mark on 18 June, triggering an extension of recent zoning arrangements and existing restrictions across the country to 30 June 2020. This comes at the same time as heavy rains batter Cox’s Bazar, causing some flooding in the camps. Alongside government and UN initiatives to increase the number of isolation and treatment centres and the testing capacity of the only laboratory in the district,

BDRCS with support from IFRC, Qatar Red Crescent, Swiss Red Cross, and Swedish Red Cross, is constructing two Integrated Isolation and Treatment Centres (IITCs) for COVID-19 with a capacity of 80 beds in total, located in camps 7 (50 beds) and 2E (30 beds) – the facility in Camp 2E began operations recently, while the other IITC is scheduled to be launched on 28 June.

The Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP) and BDRCS, with support from IFRC and American Red Cross, continue to address the dual threats of monsoon-associated hazards and the spread of COVID-19. The camp volunteers have been engaged with ISCG, UNHCR, IOM and Site Management Support agencies to complete smallscale mitigation actions after Cyclone Amphan and heavy rainfall in different camp blocks. As part of continuous efforts for monsoon preparedness and response, disaster readiness-related Personal Protection Gear has been replenished. 3,838 volunteers including 3,400 CPP camp volunteers have been mobilised for dissemination of COVID-19 key message and handwashing demonstration in all 34 camps. 254,000 IEC materials were produced and distributed, while 80,180 sets of personal protective equipment (PPE) was provided to BDRCS frontline staff and community volunteers.","Mon, 29 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1524480-Monthly%20Sitrep%20No%20%2060_PMO%2C%20BDRCS.png?itok=creQwnA2,"['operation', 'situation', 'coxs', 'red', 'preparedness', 'population', 'covid19', 'volunteers', 'amphan', 'society', 'camp', 'cross', 'bazar', 'bangladesh', 'pmo', 'report', 'cyclone', 'monthly', 'movement']",

Heavy downpour and onrush of water from upstream caused flash flood in parts of 16 northern and north-eastern districts.

Prices of vegetables increased by Tk 10-30 a kg in last three days due to supply crunch, said traders.

Green chilli prices soared to Tk 120-150 a kg from Tk 80-90 a kg earlier, according to kitchen markets.

Green papaya, which was one of the cheapest vegetables in the year, was sold at Tk 55-65 a kg in different kitchen markets of the city on Wednesday.

Most of the seasonal vegetables, including pointed gourd, pumpkin, ridge, sponge gourds, summer brinjal and bitter gourd, showed a hike as they were selling at Tk 60-80 a kg on the day.

Stored tomato prices rose to Tk 120-130 a kg on the day which was Tk 80-100 a week back.

Leafy prices, however, remained the same at Tk 10-25 per bunch based on varieties.

Belayet Hossain, a vegetable vendor at Rayer Bazar, said he bought tomato at Tk 500 per five kg on the day which was Tk 360-400 few days back.

Arman Ali, a Shyambazar-based trader, said supply of summer vegetables declined from different hubs like Sirajganj, Gaibandha, Bogura, Tangail, Manikganj, and Jamalpur due to flood.

Ali said prices of vegetables might continue the current trend for next few weeks.

Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) said vegetables on 6,500 hectares of land have been so far damaged by flash flood in 16 districts.

Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB) secretary Humayun Kabir Bhuiyan said prices of veggies have increased to some extent following water-logging in some districts.

""But our field reports show that there is a big price gap between farm level and Dhaka city retail markets.""

He said pointed gourd was selling at Tk 18-19 a kg at Ghior in Manikganj for the last three days when it was traded at Tk 36-38 a kg at the capital's Karwan Bazar wholesale.

The same produce was retailed at Tk 60 a kg at Shegunbagicha Bazar on Tuesday.

An 80-120 per cent price gap still exists causing difficulties for limited income group people, he said, adding that the government should introduce a mechanism so that this price gap could be minimised.

Sound marketing of farmers' produce should be ensured through introducing farmers' markets in the cities, he added.

Nearly 14 million people in 26 different provinces had been affected by storms and floods by Friday, with 744,000 evacuated, the China Daily reported, citing the Ministry for Emergency Management. The ministry said 78 people have been confirmed dead or missing, with direct economic losses at 27.8 billion yuan ($3.93 billion).

Much of the damage has hit southwestern regions like Guangxi and Sichuan, and the municipality of Chongqing on the upper reaches of the Yangtze river last week experienced its worst floods since 1940.

But central and eastern regions are set to bear the brunt this week, with some facing 30mm to 50mm (1.2 inches to 2 inches) of rain per hour by Wednesday, the state meteorological bureau said.

Regions along the banks of the Yangtze and its tributaries are traditionally vulnerable to flooding in China's summer, with the impact of heavy rainfall worsened by deforestation, dwindling flood plains and the diversion of natural river systems for hydropower and irrigation.

Rainfall has also been heavier than usual, with water volumes in 148 rivers already reaching emergency levels by mid-June. Local authorities are under instruction to pay attention to potential dam and reservoir collapses.

West Bengal is one of the most climatically vulnerable states of India — with a history of a high number of severe cyclones in the Bay of Bengal coast, severe thunderstorms, a high sea-level rise and projected flood risk. These observations were pointed out in India’s first official climate assessment report.

The Bay of Bengal region was struck by the highest number of cyclones in May and November according to the long-term analysis between 1891 and 2018, revealed the report Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region. It was released by the Ministry of Earth Sciences recently.

The region was hit by 41 severe cyclonic storms and 21 cyclonic storms in May during the given period. The figures jumped to 72 and 55 in November during the 127-year timeline. During the period, the Arabian Sea coast was struck by fewer cyclones.

The report found that from 2000 to 2018, the Bay of Bengal region experienced 16 Category 4 and above level cyclones — very severe cyclonic storms and extremely severe cyclonic storms — out of 22 cyclones that struck the region.

The report also mentioned a significant eastward shift in tropical cyclone genesis locations in the Bay of Bengal region during post-monsoon seasons, which may enhance the risk for the coastal regions of West Bengal.

During 2019-20, West Bengal coast witnessed landfalls of two extremely severe cyclones — Cyclone Bulbul and Cyclone Amphan — in November, 2019 and May, 2020.

While cyclone Bulbul had a maximum wind speed of 155 kilometre per hour, Amphan had maximum wind speed of 185 km per hour. Both made landfalls near the western part of Indian Sundarbans close to Sagar Island.

“According to our study, maximum landfalls happened in Sundarbans area within the Bay of Bengal coast line ranging from Orissa to Bangladesh,” said Sunondo Bandopadhyay, geography professor in Calcutta University.

The report mentioned that the flood risk increased over the east coast of India, with West Bengal being one the vulnerable states. “The flood risk has increased over the east coast; West Bengal, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Konkan region, as well as a majority of urban areas such as Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai,” the report stated.

It added that as against the global average warming of 0.7 degrees Celsius, sea surface temperature of the tropical Indian Ocean rose by on an average of 1°C between 1951 and 2015. Such an increase in ocean temperature has a direct bearing on the intensity of thunderstorms and cyclones in the zone, experts noted.

“West Bengal experienced the most intense thunderstorm events and high casualties during the period (1978 -2012),” stated the report, hinting at the temperature rise linkage.

“West Bengal and surrounding regions recorded between 80 and 100 days of thunderstorm activity annually. The report findings hold significance for the state because rapid warming of the Indian Ocean is resulting in intense and extreme cyclones pummeling the entire coastal region of India,” said Aarti Khosla of Climate Trends, a climate assessment portal.

“Climatic impacts are responsible as sea surface temperature rise has contributed to the trend,” said an expert associated with the state environment department.

The report also pointed out that the sea level has been rising at a rate of five centimetres per decade off the Bengal coast — the highest in the country. The rise — considered a long-term impact of climate change — is about three centimetres per decade close to Mumbai.

The union government, in response to a question by the Trinamool Congress parliamentarian Saugoto Roy, had informed the Lok Sabha that the sea level rise was the highest at Diamonharbour near the mouth of the Sundarbans.

“The latest report has only established what independent experts have been saying for long — West Bengal needs a lot of support from the Centre and international sources to combat disasters triggered by increasing extreme weather events prodded by climate change,” said Javed Ahmed Khan, disaster management minister, West Bengal.","Fri, 03 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",,"['assessment', 'storms', 'report', 'region', 'coast', 'west', 'cyclones', 'flags', 'cyclonic', 'risk', 'climate', 'bengal', 'vulnerable', 'severe', 'indias']",

This is the largest allocation order under the VGF program so far

The government has decided to distribute free rice to more than 10 million vulnerable people across the country before and during the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha holidays, amid the Covid-19 pandemic that is battering the economy.

“It is the largest allocation of aid in a single order under the VGF (Vulnerable Group Feeding) program so far,” said Disaster Management and Relief Ministry Secretary Md Mohsin.

The government aid will amount to 100,068 tons of rice for 10,006,869 people (or over 10 million) beneficiaries under the VGF program. Each of them will get 10kgs rice.

The ministry on Tuesday sent an order to the director general of the Disaster Management Department in this regard, issuing the necessary instructions.

According to the order, 87,792 tons of rice has been allotted to 8,779,203 VGF cardholders for distribution in 64 districts, and 12,276 tons of rice for 1,227,666 cardholders in 328 municipalities under three — A, B and C — categories.

The order instructed the deputy commissioners (DCs) of the districts to collect the aid by July 28 and inform local MPs about the aid allocation.

The government usually allocates this type of aid under the VGF program on all religious festivals, including Eid and Durga Puja. Also, victims of natural disasters, such as flood and cyclone victims, and fishermen during fishing bans, are given such aid.

“We have taken the initiative so that none of these people remain unfed during Eid. The people affected by floods, and marginalized people hit by other natural disasters, will be given priority for this aid,” Mohsin told Dhaka Tribune. “But, all people distressed by the pandemic will also get the support.”

He added that they have categorized the beneficiaries in three groups that may help the DCs prepare a proper list of vulnerable people who need the aid.

The conditions

With Tuesday’s order, the ministry also set 12 conditions to select people who would be eligible to receive aid.

The conditions say a family will be eligible if (it): 1. owns no land other than a homestead 2. is dependent on daily wage income 3. is dependent on the income of a female worker or upon begging 4. has no earning adult male member 5. is a family where a school-going child has to work to earn a living; 6. has no breadwinner; 7. head of the family is an abandoned, widowed or divorced woman; 8. head of the family is an indigent freedom fighter 9. the head of the family is indigent and disabled 10. The family did not receive any microcredit 11. the family was hit by a natural disaster and is in dire need of food or money, and 12. family members do not get food aid twice a year for most of the year.

According to the order, those who fall under four of the 12 conditions will be eligible for aid.

The list will be prepared and sanctioned by union or municipal VGF committees, while government authorities concerned will deliver the rice and bear the expenses.

Authorities have also been instructed to make sure that only one member of a family gets aid under the program.

Other support

On May 14, the government inaugurated a cash aid program for five million people in distress because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

More than three million listed people made vulnerable by the pandemic have already received the monetary support. The distribution process for giving the money to another two million people is underway.

The Finance Division in an order recently said that listed people will have to open a Tk10 bank account with the recommendation of their upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) to get the money.

The division’s Joint Secretary, Shirajun Noor Chowdhury, told Dhaka Tribune: “The listed families mostly received Tk2,500 through mobile financial services. But many people are yet to get the money due to some challenges and unavoidable reasons.”

“We have already issued an order to deposit the money to these people’s bank accounts,” he said.

“However, until the process is completed, the government will not start the second phase,” Shirajun added.

Apart from this, the government is continuing relief distribution as part of its humanitarian assistance to mitigate people’s sufferings in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and the flooding in different districts.

Around five million people will get one kg rice at Tk10 only under the Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) program amid the pandemic.

Until Tuesday, 211,017 tons of rice were allocated as relief, and of that, 198,120 tons were distributed among more than 73.8 million people from over 16.8 million families across 64 districts, according to an official handout.

The government has also so far allocated nearly Tk123 crore in cash for distribution among the people, as cash assistance and for purchasing baby food and other food items.","Tue, 07 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2020/04/watermarked/335100/1594176009770lead-1587120188302-1587460354741.jpeg,"['food', 'order', 'million', 'family', 'program', 'pandemic', 'amid', 'tons', 'bangladesh', 'eid', 'rice', 'vgf', 'vulnerable', 'aid']",

Dhaka (AFP)

A coronavirus outbreak among Rohingya refugees has been ""successfully contained"", Bangladesh officials have said after fears that the disease spread rapidly in overcrowded camps.

Nearly one million Rohingya live in squalid camps in southeastern Bangladesh, after fleeing a 2017 military crackdown in Myanmar, where the mostly Muslim community is a minority.

Some 724 Rohingya have been tested in the Bangladesh camps, with 54 found positive since the first cases were detected in May, officials said.

""We have successfully contained the outbreak,"" Bangladesh refugee commissioner Mahbub Alam Talukder told AFP on Monday, adding that only five Rohingya have died from the virus so far.

It was not clear, however, if some Rohingya avoided testing because of fears they would be moved to an isolated and flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal, where other refugees were taken to after being found at sea.

In contrast, there have been more than 2,776 confirmed infections including 60 deaths among the 2.4 million Bangladeshis living in the wider Cox's Bazar district, where the camps are located, Talukder said.

The three dozen camps were locked down after the first few cases were found, with refugees barred from leaving the area.

Officials used loudhailers to tell residents to wash their hands, stay indoors and wear a mask if they were in public spaces, said Rohingya teacher Mohammad Shafi, who lives in the Kutupalong shelter, the world's biggest refugee camp.

Authorities distributed soap among the refugees, shut most shops and restricted the number of aid workers allowed to enter the camps, he added.

""A lot of people suffered from seasonal flu, headaches, body pain and diarrhoea in recent weeks,"" Shafi told AFP.

""And most didn't go to the hospitals. Instead, they took medicines from local pharmacies (in the camps).""

Testing is not compulsory and it is not known if the overall death rate in the camps among the mostly Muslim minority has increased.

People who die in the camps are also not tested for the virus.

Strong current is devouring houses and farmlands as the water level of the river has been receding for the last two days.

Locals are passing days in panic.

Though, the Teesta water was flowing above the danger level for four days, the water level has started to recede from Monday and now flowing below the danger level.

The water level of the river at the Dalia Point of Hatibandha upazia has been marked 52.5cm which is 2cm lower than normal flow, said Rabiul Islam, executive engineer of Teesta Barrage Project of Dalia.

From Monday morning, the flood situation started to improve in the district.

With the recession of flood water, the sufferings of flood victims have increased also.

Severe erosion has occurred in Char Gokunda of Sadar upazila, Kutirpar of Aditmari, Chandimari, Dakshin Balapara, Shailmari Char of Kaliganj, Saniajan, Sindurna, Dauabari and Gaddimari of Hatibandha upazila.

In the last two days, more than a hundred houses in the district have been devoured by the Teesta. Hundreds of houses, establishments and crop lands have been damaged. The people of Teesta embankment are spending sleepless nights in fear of erosion, said the affected people.

80,80,FL-2020-000161-BGD,Lockdown-hit farmers begin to sow summer crops in South Asia - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1566549,"Even as Covid-19 spreads like wildfire across South Asia, farmers are planting the summer crop.

The southwest monsoon has arrived in most parts of South Asia and farmers in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal have started planting the summer crop. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected the already distressed agriculture sector in these countries in different ways, and the stakes couldn’t be higher for farmers in this cropping season.

Covid-19 has already afflicted more than a million people in the four countries, with infections rising fast in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, latest data shows. South Asia has taken a beating from the lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of the virus, and with growth shrinking in the industrial and services sectors, hope is now pinned on adequate monsoon rainfall and farmers gathering a good harvest to breathe life back into the battered economies.

Although the share of agriculture in national GDPs varies from 25% in Nepal to 13% in Bangladesh, farming provides a livelihood to the vast majority of the countries’ working populations.

As the pandemic-forced lockdowns disrupted labour mobility and vehicular transportation, farmers have struggled to harvest and sell the winter crop, leading to widespread losses across the subcontinent. ""In the past few months, I have fed vegetables from the farm to the livestock as I couldn’t sell them,"" said Ishwar Acharya, a farmer from Morang district in eastern Nepal.

Farm inputs

As the summer sowing season approached, scarcities in farm inputs were reported, and prices rose. ""Cost of seeds in Jharkhand and Bihar have increased by as much as 15% to 25%, which has led to difficulties for small and marginal farmers,"" said Ranchi-based Ashok Kumar of Transform Rural India Foundation (Trif), a non-profit that works in the poorest states of India.

Big farmers in India's breadbasket in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh are better insulated from such price shocks as they are able to place bulk orders in advance, said New Delhi-based Satyabrata Acharyya of Professional Assistance for Development Action (Pradan), a rural grassroots organisation.

Prices of farm inputs have risen in southern India as well. However, farmer producer organisations have intervened significantly in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka so that cultivators have not been short on seeds, according to Ravindra Adusimilli of Hyderabad-based Watershed Support Services and Activities Network (Wassan).

In Pakistan, prices of farm inputs have increased significantly, farmers said. Pakistan imports large amounts of chemicals for fertilisers and pesticides, and the supply chain disruption caused by the pandemic has led to price increases. This will eat into the margins of smallholder and middle farmers, according to Waqas Gondal, a farmer from south Punjab .

The government has, however, provided some financial assistance to farmers to buy inputs. Cultivators will also soon get relief in energy costs, which account for 30% of all inputs, according to Khalid Jamil of the National Agriculture Research Centre (Narc).

In Nepal, there is an acute scarcity of fertilisers. The Himalayan nation imports nearly all of its chemical fertilisers, mostly from the Middle East and China via India's ports. Some 50,000 tonnes of fertilisers are stuck in the port of Kolkata and 21,000 tonnes in Kandla’s port in Gujarat, according to Nepal’s farm ministry.

""It will take more than a month to bring the stuck fertilisers,"" the ministry said in a press statement. The government aims to sell nearly half a million tonnes of subsidised fertilisers to farmers this year to tide them over the Covid-19 crisis.

""If you ask a supplier for urea, the answer would be, we don’t have it now. If you ask for Diammonium Phosphate (Dap), you would be told to wait a couple of weeks,"" said Acharya, the farmer from eastern Nepal. ""Only about 25% is provided, and that too after queuing up for two weeks at least.""

Farmers at receiving end

""The worst part is that farmers cannot determine their prices; the middleman does that,"" said Aamer Hayat Bhandara, a farmer from Punjab's Pakpattan district. ""And the government has a terrible role in this. It gives zero security to farmers."" Instead of giving farmers a little bit of extra money during the crisis, the government opened the market for importers, he alleged.

To add to the woes, the huge migrant labour force that works in cities returned to their villages and, in the absence of gainful employment, used up precious savings that would have been invested in cultivating the summer crop.

In Pakistan, expectations of farmers who grow rice, corn, cotton and sugar during the monsoon are running low. ""Take cotton, our major crop that runs our entire textile industry. In this fiscal year, nothing has been kept aside for cotton,"" said Bhandara. ""There is no development even though the prime minister had been willing to revive the crop once upon a time."" Even the target of 2.8% of the national budget for agricultural development this fiscal year is lower than usual, he said.

In India and Pakistan, a plague of locusts has further decimated crops. Authorities haven’t ruled out the threat of locusts swarming again in July.

Labour issues

The lockdown in South Asia led to a mass exodus of migrant labourers to villages, which resulted in labour scarcity in some areas and excess in others.

In the poorer states of India such as Jharkhand in the east, which is home to a large number of migrant labourers, the recent influx has led to a surplus. Villages in Bangladesh and Nepal, too, are flush with returned migrants.

While this is good news for landholders, the same cannot be said of temporary farmhands because wages have crashed. In Bangladesh, for instance, farm wages have been rising steadily in the past decade, said Abdur Razzak, a farmer from the northern district of Rangpur. ""It was tough to get adequate numbers of them when it was required,"" he said.

The situation has dramatically changed in recent weeks, according to Razzak. ""Many of them who migrated from the village to urban areas are returning to villages, so wages have gone down,"" he said.

The same holds true in the poorer provinces in eastern India, said Kumar of Trif.

On the other hand, farmers with large landholdings in the breadbaskets of India and Pakistan are facing a labour shortage. In Indian Punjab, for instance, farmers' groups are ferrying farmhands back to the state. Since paddy sowing depends heavily on manual labour, the shortage due to the earlier exodus has led to a rise in wages, which will impact profit margins, farmers say.

Fear of floods

Despite the farming lifeline the monsoon extends to South Asia, it also exacts a heavy price during floods. Although the 2020 southwest monsoon has just about started, heavy rains are already flooding large parts of Assam, Meghalaya, northern Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sikkim and Nepal. Some 50 people have been killed in these parts of South Asia, including 23 in Assam and 18 in Nepal.

Farmers in flood-prone Bangladesh are bracing themselves. ""In case of Aman, I have been cultivating flood-resistant varieties for two years,"" said Akram Hossain, a farmer from Lalmonirhat district in the Teesta river basin. Aman is the principal paddy variety grown in Bangladesh and eastern India at this time of the year.

Farmers in the Indian state of Bihar are less prepared to face floods than they are in normal years. The Covid-19 pandemic has delayed flood-control preparations, with nearly 30% of embankment repair and anti-erosion works incomplete. The state government has just started a Twitter handle through which it is inviting citizens to inform the authorities if any embankment is breached.

Some areas of 16 districts in northern and north-eastern regions are witnessing flood amid rain and onrush of upstream water from India.

Costs of vegetables increased by Tk 10-30 a kg in last three days amid a supply crunch, said traders.

Green chilli prices hit Tk 120-150 a kg kg from Tk 80-90 a kg earlier, according to kitchen markets.

Green papaya, which was one of the cheapest vegetables in the year, was sold at Tk 55-65 a kg in different kitchen markets of the city on Tuesday.

Most of the seasonal vegetables, including pointed gourd, pumpkin, ridge, sponge gourds, summer brinjal and bitter gourd, showed a hike as they were selling at Tk 60-80 a kg on the day.

Stored tomato prices rose to Tk 120-130 a kg on the day which was Tk 80-100 a week back.

Leafy prices, however, remained same at Tk 10-25 per bunch based on varieties.

Belayet Hossain, a vegetable vendor at Rayer Bazar, said he bought tomato at Tk 500 per five kg on the day which was Tk 360-400 few days back.

Arman Ali, a Shyambazar-based trader, said supply of summer vegetables declined from the hubs like Sirajganj, Gaibandha, Bogura, Tangail, Manikganj, Jamalpur and other districts amid the ongoing flood in the districts.

Ali said prices of vegetables might continue the current trend for next few weeks following flood in many districts.

However, the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) recorded 6,500 hectares of veggie fields have been damaged by the ongoing flood in 16 districts so far.

Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB) Secretary Humayun Kabir Bhuiyan, said prices of veggies have increased to some extend in places following water-logging in some districts.

But our field reports show that there are a huge price gap between farm level and Dhaka city retail markets is much higher.

He said pointed gourd was selling at Tk 18-19 a kg at Ghior in Manikganj for the last three days when the produce was traded at Tk 36-38 a kg at the capital's Karwan Bazar wholesale.

The same produce was retailed at Tk 60 a kg in Shegunbagicha bazar on Tuesday.

He said a 80-120 per cent price gap still exists causing difficulties for limited income groups.

He said the government should introduce a mechanism so that this price gap could be minimised.

Sound marketing of farmers' produce should be ensured through introducing farmers' markets in the cities, he added.

Previews of Coming Disasters



Catastrophe is in the air: the sense of it is almost palpable. It is our entertainment, our fear, our fantasy, our future. We have come to expect calamity as a matter of course.

Apocalyptic ages before us be­lieved in the end of the world, but then it was a question of man’s damnation and God’s will. Nobody carries signs today saying “Repent, the End is Near” — they don’t need to. So what else is new? we’d say. There is something frivolous about our rapid change from confidence into fear of our scientific accom­plishments, in our swing back to Original Sin, even in our safe en­joyment of film spectaculars like “Earthquake” and “The Towering Inferno.” We seem to accept the immanence of catastrophe yet at the same time refuse to take it serious­ly.

Perhaps that’s because we lack experience. It used to be said that Americans didn’t understand war because their homeland had never been ravaged by one. A broader generalization is that we have been mostly spared from catastrophe. Disasters — explosions, plane crashes, ship sinkings, major fires­ — we’ve had aplenty, but never a mor­tal blow. Consider the casualty fig­ures in what have become our legendary calamities, like the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 which killed from 452 to 700 people or the Johnstown flood which claimed 2200. That the numbers look big is a dead giveaway.

A real earthquake in terms of victims occurred on Jan. 24, 1556, in Shensi Province, China: 830,000 dead, mostly in landslides. In Cal­cutta, in 1737, an earthquake and a cyclone teamed up to take 300,000 lives. Floods? If the Mississippi overflows its banks there is much lamentation and discomfort but not as much as there was along the Yangtze in 1887 when almost a million people perished. Nor let us for­get Noah. Dr. Reid Bryson of the University of Wisconsin believes that the story of Noah is based on a Sumerian folk hero who lived 5300 years ago in the lowlands of the Tigris-Euphrates rivers and that rains and flooding were so extensive and long-lasting as to change the face of Sumerian society.

At many times over the centuries it must have seemed to those in the middle of nature’s tantrums that whatever the world was made for, it wasn’t people. Three cyclones — or hurricane-type storms — struck what is now Bangladesh in 1965, killing almost 60,000, but that was only a prelude to the cyclone of 1970 that took 225,000, mostly by drowning. It also destroyed the rice crop at har­vest time, contributing to uncounted deaths by starvation. Nature has lost none of its punch. (The 1970 Bangla­desh storm may not have been the worst there. An 1876 cyclone killed between 100,000 and 400,000.)

Those who happily slight science and technology, whose idea of pro­gress is the natural food shoppe and the “Whole Earth Catalog” might ponder what are horribly called disease vectors. The “Black Death” or bubonic plague is thought to have killed 25 million in Asia and Europe in 1340s, three million in 1898-1908 in China and India, and two million more in India in the 1920s. There were four major outbreaks of cholera in Europe during the 1880s with many millions dead — almost one million in 1831 alone. Smallpox in Brazil killed three million in 1560 and Cuba lost a quarter of the world’s population, and the influenza pan­demic of 1917-1919 may have been the single greatest catastrophe in histo­ry, killing perhaps 30 million world­wide and 548,000 in the U.S. Note that the number of humans existing was smaller when these epidemics occurred, and that they claimed statis­tically large portions of the popula­tions.

A particularly eerie affliction struck down whole districts of Western Europe and England in 1200 A.D. A grain fungus grows in continuously wet and mild weather, as then oc­curred, and a few blighted grains in a sack are sufficient to cause a disease called St. Anthony’s fire, which, despite its romantic name, causes convulsions, abortion, the hands and legs to turn black until fingers and toes fall off, and eventu­ally death. But if the blighted grain is stored damp, and there is no other choice, a by-product is produced which we know as LSD. People in other words went to the grave “high.”

Think of that! There they were, extremities turning black and fall­ing off, then dying without under­standing what was killing them or why they had what must have seemed a mystical experience to boot. Surely, they would have asked what was going on. Disease was hardly understood — and certainly tripping wasn’t. In this condition you would, would you not, ponder the mood of the Almighty?

Not today. Today we are causally minded — we understand the reasons for things (or think we do), which may be why we have ceased to believe in and need God, once the all-purpose reason. Understanding confers on us the gift of foresight, the ability to reason in front, to anticipate at least a little of the future. That is a brand-new tool, and per­haps some of the seers and sages who employ it err on the side of pessimism and overstate the hazards ahead. Nonetheless, possible catastrophies predicted far outdo those of the past, either because the population is larger or because man­made dangers have been added to natural ones. Some of these conceiv­able events would directly threaten human survival, and we are right to worry. The question is whether we worry enough. Let us give form to a dozen of what might be calamities to come.

WEATHER WARFARE

Probability: Uncertain

Possible Magnitude: Elim­ination of mankind.

Timetable: ?

Wars, since they are intended to kill, usually fail to be counted as catastrophes. But in the past, wars, no matter how devastating, always ended sooner or later and normal life resumed until the next one. This is no longer true: at least four kinds of warfare could alter planetary conditions for some time to come, perhaps forever so far as humanity is concerned.

Of the four, three are too familiar to need explication — chemical, bio­logical, and nuclear (reducing the ozone layer, increasing radiation, perhaps depleting atmospheric oxygen) warfare. The fourth, using the environment itself for hostile pur­poses, is potentially the most dangerous. Dr. Edward Teller has said that weather war would be the “last” war, meaning that there might be nobody left to fight the next one.

As brought out in 1974 Senate hearings under Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, the U.S. practiced weather warfare over the Ho Chi Minh trail from 1967 to 1972. The weapon was cloud-seeding and the objective was to soften road surfaces, cause landslides, wash out river crossings, and maintain damp soil for long periods of time. Apparently the program achieved suc­cess, for rainfall in some areas increased 30 per cent or more, with subsequent declines in North Vietnamese traffic. (The Soviet Union has accused the U.S. of having tried to tamper with the weather in North Vietnam too, but we have denied it.)

But the rain-making in Asia was primitive alongside more sophisti­cated possibilities of weather war: “aiming” hurricanes; causing rain to be acidic to knock out equipment; forming or intensifying fog; starting fiery cyclones called “fire storms”; producing earthquakes; detonating atomic devices in the ice pack which, falling into the sea, would cause massive tidal waves; manipulating electrical properties in the atmosphere so as to interfere with normal electrical processes of the brain and bring about disorientation and derangement; inflicting ditto on the enemy’s navy with oceanic vibrations; breaking a window in the ozone layer which would intensify hard, ultra-violet radiation on enemy territory, perhaps destroying all forms of life and turning the land into a desert. Such warfare might be slow­ and insidiously difficult to detect. Weather warfare should not be dismissed lightly: Jacob A. Malik, the Soviet ambassador to the UN made a speech there in 1974 warning of the dangers.

INADVERTENT CLIMATE MODIFICATION (COLD)

Probability: good

Possible magnitude: Hundreds of millions dead

Timetable: Immediate future.

Much impressive data shows that the world’s climate is becoming colder of itself, after a time of ex­ceptional warmth. Periods of greater or lesser cold have, of course, been normal throughout history. This new cold, however is different in two vital ways. First, the favorable growing conditions that existed between 1900 and 1910 in­creased the food supply and en­couraged the vast population increases that occurred in places like South Asia. The coming cold would mean heavy rains in the northern temperate zones, reducing the food supplies, and subtropical drought further reducing it. Casualties from famine would be immense.



Second, and even more ominous, man has been changing the atmosphere. From power plants, mills, autos, furnaces, slash-and-burn farming (practiced in most places on earth ), even from millions of feet tramping on dry soil, particles are thrown into the air forming what is called a “particulate cloud.” This cloud, virtually world-wide, blocks incoming solar radiation sufficiently to add to the cooling already underway, with the result of a further decline in mean annual temperature. A drop of only 4-5° F. (2° C), believes Dr. Bryson, foremost proponent of the cooling hypothesis, would be sufficient to initiate a new Ice Age.

INADVERTENT CLIMATE MODIFICATION (HEAT)

Probability: Fair to good

Possible magnitude: Hundreds of millions dead to elimination of mankind

Timetable: 25 to 250 years.

Will the world end in a shiver or a sweat? Another harrowing view holds that the long-term trend is toward heat — far too much of it.

Man-made heat is still only a frac­tion of that received from the sun but is growing exponentially and may become a pollutant that must be reckoned with. According to Dr. Thomas F. Malone. Director, Hal­comb Research Institute, Butler Uni­versity, we may face one of the major policy decisions of all time. “I refer to the limited capacity of the biosphere to absorb heat … Simply put, the concentration of heat discharged into the atmosphere may turn out to reach a high enough val­ue within the next hundred years that we will have to place restraints on the population, on the population distribution, or on the energy con­sumption per person. The policy im­plications for the world, and in par­ticular for our nation, which has such a high consumption of energy per capita, are obvious.”

According to one calculation, man-made emitted heat will equal absorbed solar heat in 250 years. Mean annual temperature will then have risen from the present 58° F, to 190° F, a level incompatible with human life as we have known it. But as Dr. Robert Heilbroner points out, time may be shorter than that be­cause of sharply rising energy use (meaning heat) and increasing pop­ulations that will need more energy still.

Nor is this quite all or it. Atmo­spheric carbon dioxide is also increasing because of the burning of fossil fuels. CO2 has an important role in the “heat budget,” as it’s called, because it prevents heat from escaping into space, a beneficial function so long as there isn’t too much heat and too much CO2. If man-made heat became an impor­tant factor, and a dense CO2 blanket prevented it from escaping, global heat could rise rapidly, especially if the cooling period ended. In that kind of world, it might be against the law to light a match.

DESTRUCTION OF THE OZONE SHIELD

Probability: Highly uncertain

Possible Magnitude: Elimination of all life

Timetable: Starting now

About 20 miles up in the stratosphere hangs a thin layer of ozone that absorbs ultra-violet radiation from the sun and makes life on earth possible. Scientists are deeply concerned that man could destroy this vital shield with nitrous oxides from sub and supersonic aircraft, from the space shuttle, from nuclear explosions or even nitrogen fertilizer. At the moment, the number one hazard is thought to be chlorofluromethane (Freon), a million tons of which are manufactured a year for use as the propellent in aerosol cans and as a refrigerant. Eventually this gas drifts up and destroys ozone. Best estimates say that the Freons already released will deplete the ozone shield three to six per cent. A reduction of only five per cent would cause 8000 new cases of skin cancer a year in the U.S. If the ozone layer were further destroyed, results could include widespread cancer, the disruption of agricultural produc­tion, reduction of the oxygen supply (through the killing of phytoplankton in the ocean), plant and animal mutations, and a global desert.

PEACETIME NUCLEAR CALAMTTY

Probability: Uncertain

Possible magnitude: Elim­ination of higher forms of life

Timetable: For the global catastrophe, 40 years minimum.

The well-known doomsday clock on the cover of the “Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists” stands at nine minutes to midnight. When created, this clock ticked away the likelihood of atomic warfare between major nations. Now it must measure as well the potential threat from a starving Third World nation that has acquired nuclear power, and from accidents among the 24,000 breeder reactor nuclear power plants that will be required to provide all the world’s primary energy a century from now. Under present conditions, with nuclear power plants constructed under U.S. safety standards, the “maximum credible” accident, ac­cording to a 1957 AEC study, would kill over 3000 people, injure 40,000, and quarantine agriculture over a 150,000 square mile area. But the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Sierra Club predict 120,000 people killed or made seriously ill. The probability of such accidents in­creases with each plant that is built. The combination of threats from accidents and deliberate acts in han­dling the 15,000 tons of plutonium required for 24,000 plants is so great that the president of the National Academy of Sciences, Philip Handler, has warned: “Somehow, the world must skip the breeder reactor and go from petroleum and coal — liquid, gassified, and solid — to fusion and/or solar energy or it is inconceivable that the human race will avoid a worldwide calamity on so large a scale as to jeopardize the continuing future of our species.”

NEW KILLER VlRUS

Probability: Remote

Possible magnitude: Hundreds of millions dead

Timetable: Any time

Epidemic diseases, man’s greatest killers, remain possible, though we think of them as part of the past. New strains of influenza, for example, can occur and vaccines are only marginally effective and probably couldn’t be produced in time to help against a mass outbreak. Further, amid the famine and collapse of the social order many forsee in parts of the world, preventive measures might not be implemented and mil­lions could perish.

An utterly new man-made virus for which no immunization or cure existed, would be a graver menace still. From working with DNA, a molecule that stores and transmits information, scientists have come to believe that genetic engineering, though filled with hopeful possibilities for curing genetic diseases and deficiencies (or even make possible, say, human beings with chlorophyll in their skins who could take energy from the sun, like plants) could lead, by accident or design, to a new incurable disease. So serious is this possibility considered that, last July, pioneers in the field, through the National Academy of Sciences, asked for a voluntary world-wide ban on aspects of DNA research because of its “unpredictable ef­fect.” This February, DNA researchers will meet to try to find a solution to their problem (This may be the first time in history that scientists accept restrictions on the freedom of research other than ex­perimentation with humans.)

CALAMITOUS EARTHQUAKES

Probability: 100 per cent

Possible magnitude: 560,000 deaths plus

Timetable: Any time

Out of the 100,000 earthquakes a year, a few will be major. The only question is where they happen and how many die.

Two large cities located on faults are San Francisco and Tokyo. If a quake of the magnitude of the one that shook Alaska in 1964 (magnitude over 8.6, 20 times larger than the magnitude 8.3 of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake) property damage has been estimated at $10 billion and casualties up to 250,000 and higher if Crystal Springs Dam broke, flooding San Mateo (this dam, however, sur­vived 1906), or if high-rise buildings performed poorly. The problem with San Francisco is that the fault has been locked: instead of slipping slowly, the fault and its “tribu­taries” have not moved since 1906 and a potential movement of 13 feet has been accumulated. By way of comparison, the 1923 Tokyo quake moved nine feet.

As for Tokyo, despite the quake that killed 56,000 in ’23, construction is not much different. The population is, being much larger, and, according to Japanese estimates, 560,000 plus could die in a big quake, espe­cially if (as is likely) a tsunami also occurred, flooding the extensive sub­way system and underground com­mercial development. (Tsunamis can travel at 600 mph; in 1923, one hit Japan twice, having crossed the Pacific and bounced back again.) At Tokyo, a major quake has happened at least once within every 69 years.

Japanese, American, and Russian scientists are all working on earth­quake warning systems, and these illustrate catastrophe problems rather vividly. Suppose the scientists were certain, which they are not, that such a system would work. Would anyone pay for it? And, if it were developed, what would be done? Would politicians, who might be long out of office when E-Day came, warn the public and begin precautionary measures now? Would the public credit scientists, especially as they couldn’t forecast the quake to the precise hour, day, week or maybe even month? Proba­bly not. Today, houses are built, and people live in them, right along the San Andreas Fault.

CATASTROPHIC HURRICANES

Probability: 100 per cent

Possible magnitude: 1 million deaths

Timetable: Any time

High concentrations of populations in low-lying coastal zones along established hurricane paths add up to calamity. Dr. Neil Frank, head of the National Hurricane Center in Miami, has estimated that a 40-foot storm surge in Bangladesh (all too possible) would kill one million.

In the U.S., too, terrible things could happen. A hurricane with a central pressure of less than 26 per inches, wind in excess of 200 miles per hour, and tides of 25 or 30 feet 30 feet could easily kill tens or thousands if it struck Miami with little warning. In the Tampa-St Petersburg area, planning officials estimate, as many as 100,000 could die in a major storm. Always, people are reluctant to evacuate an impending storm path until the last minute, figuring the hurricane will miss them or that they can ride it out. In this region especially, last minutemanship will cause tragedy because of the inade­quacy of roads leading to higher ground, much new housing which might not take the effects of flooding, and the advanced age of the popula­tion, making them less mobile.

Even if we could eliminate hurricanes we wouldn’t want to since hurricanes are important in terms of rainfall. Casualties, though, could be reduced with the proper land-use policies, construction codes, and so on. With cloud-seeding, hurricanes may yet be controlled. In the mean time …

MASSIVE FAMINE

Probability: Almost a certainty,

Possible Magnitude: 50 million deaths a year

Timetable: This year?

Although people have starved ­— and starve now in Asia and Africa ­— the world has simply never known famine on the scale predicted for the coming decades. It is completely outside our experience and almost beyond our imagination. Vast though they may be, the political, moral, and ethical questions that must de­velop from this catastrophe remain almost unexplored.

If there should be severe drought in 1975, Green-Revolutionist Norman Borlaug has estimated that as many as 50 million children would starve unless there were a world “food bank” available. In a normal, non-drought year starvation is a closely related cause for about half of all child deaths in the poor countries. (Famine deaths mean children)

In “Mankind at the Turning Point,” Mesarovic and Pestel divide the world into 10 regions with alternate scenarios for each. With severe but feasible adjustments nine of these regions can survive a decent standard of living assuming that food production keeps up with population increase: this is nowhere guaranteed. But for South Asia (Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka — formerly Ceylon) the prospect is gruesome. For this region alone, the following projections ap­pear reasonable:

In the next decade: five to seven million child death a year; 20 to 50 million during drought years unless world “foodbank” available.

In the second decade: eight to 12 million during normal year.

In the third decade: 20 to 30 million during normal years.

After: Decreasing fatalities because of population decrease; hence shortages considerably reduced.

The tremendous calamity could be prevented or ameliorated if the birth rates were greatly reduced in these countries, but the probability of that happening is a virtual zero, short of the development and universal acceptance of a miracle contraceptive. In fact, the social disorganization that is likely to accompany the famine may make birth control harder to accomplish. Several decades of exceptionally favorable weather could change things too, but as we have seen the prospect is for more, not less, drought, and if the droughts were exceptionally severe the pro­jected numbers of dead would have to be upped. Besides, if famine were averted by increased food produc­tion, populations might increase still further, raising the specter of famine.

Ninety per cent of the world’s surplus grain is produced in North America and this grain could meet worldwide food shortages if a way could be found to pay for it. (The only feasible means, probably, of giving it away would be to socialize agricul­ture and sharply lower the American style of life, which seems unlikely.) But people thus saved from starvation will continue to bear children at the rate of 45 per thousand (compared to 17 per thousand in the U.S.) and by the end of the century, even under various optimistic assumptions, the Asian food shortage would be greater than the total North American grain production.

Triage, or simply letting those least likely to survive die, has been suggested as the best policy, but such an act, or lack of one, would certainly require a hardening or what moral sensibilities we have and an almost complete change in exist­ing ethics. Besides, triage assumes the chosen victims will meekly accept their fate, and that notion does not correspond with human nature as we know it.

STEADY-STATE ANARCHY

Probability: Good

Possible magnitude: Universal

Timetable: 20-100 years

In a time perhaps not too distant the world might return to barbarism — or greater barbarism than it now displays — and if we do not classify such a future as a catastrophe then we lack all faith and pride in our civilization.

Any calamity that placed more stress on the world’s delicately bal­anced social system might cause it to crumble altogether. Consider a rise in global temperature. The obvious answer would be to reduce the consumption or fossil fuels, but who would cut back? Suppose the U.S. issued a call for a worldwide energy-­use reduction of, say, five per cent. Third World leaders would inevitably respond, “Who, us? You use a third of the world’s energy as it is. You cut back.” They would tell us, further, that attempts on their part to curtail the output of energy would lead to 1000 guerrillas for every one that exists now, to the collapse of all even vaguely democratic Third World governments and eventually of the West, for how could democratic governments survive in a world of military-Socialist states?

Suppose further that our own gov­ernment then asked or demanded that we reduce energy use by per­haps 25 per cent, an amount large enough, at any rate, not only to decrease thermal output but to set an example for the rest of the world. Would Americans comply? Considering the resistance already met (including the President’s) to the most modest proposals for curtailing energy use, it appears unlikely. We might well expect a reaction far stronger, uglier, and more stubborn than that recently encountered by the attempt to secure racial balance in the Boston public schools — a simple social change by comparison. There might well be an armed insurrrection followed by a right-wing gov­ernment, itself doomed by global antagonsism.

But it’s not necessary to conjure up a severe climate change to arrive at much the same result, for mass famine could do it. The rapidly increasing populations in the poor countries have less and less to eat. They do not get much help from the rich. (The U.S. recent contribution to Pakistan earthquake relief was $25 thousand, compared to Saudi Arabia’s $10 million.) Military govern­ments come to power and refuse to let their people starve while others remain relatively prosperous. They want their share even if what Heil­broner calls “wars of redistribution” or nuclear blackmail are required to get it. A nuclear bomb is hidden in a freighter in New York harbor and set to detonate at X harbor if 10 per cent of the national wealth isn’t pledged in time — a sort of Patty Hearst-SLA model. One way or another, national wealth would be redistributed inter­nationally.

It would not seem likely, in the general poverty of the world, that what we have known as Western civilization would long endure. Most of the proud accomplishments of bourgeois society would be seen as wasteful, expensive, and deeply un­fair, since it would not be the lot of Global Everyman to enjoy or even understand them. The skills and talents which would be permitted to exist would be only those narrow scientific and technical ones which directly and manifestly aid in human survival.

Rather than speculate endlessly, let us point to just one more possible consequence of massive famine. Suppose even looting the treasures of the rich proves to be insufficient medicine, as well it might for if the rich no longer have wealth, they cannot buy what the poor lands need to sell. We could reach a condition of steady-state anarchy: totalitarian nations everywhere, each engaged in continual attempts to raid and pillage others, no matter what their ideological stripe, just to get enough to eat, a sort of post-industrial Stone Age, in which nations would gra­dually break down as entities, fol­lowed by the collapse of regional governments and perhaps local ones. And this state would be steady, that is, it would last until … Oddly, this confirms a physical prediction of how the world will end. The universe, it seems, tries to break down the enclaves of order that represent so­ciety and indeed our world. The universe, it seems, will not be satis­fied until complete disorder is reached, and complete disorder, in these terms, is simply random par­ticles, all exactly the same.

***

Now then, are you shocked?

No. Numbed, maybe, not shocked.

That is part of the problem. How can we have this doomsday con­sciousness and yet do nothing about saving ourselves until maybe too late? After all, at least some — in fact, most — of the coming catastro­phes could be avoided, or the con­sequences minimized, given battle plans and the will to carry them out.

One reason, perhaps, is that we don’t really take the future seriously, do not really believe that anything very severe will happen, or do not care: (Apres nous, a catastrophe.) If this is true, we must account for our present anxiety on other grounds. The psychologist Leon Festinger has developed the theory of “cognitive dissonance,” holding that the mind will always try to square antinomies. If people are already anxious, and can neither rationalize away or face squarely the cause of their anxiety, they will find something exterior to be anxious about, in order to achieve consonance. Thus the fear of future catastrophes is not anxiety-provoking at all but anxiety-justifying. What then really frightens us?

Certainly the economic and political-condition of the world cannot be reassuring, even for those who experience it as a purely national or personal malaise. Many may be heading downhill and it worries them. But let us focus on just one aspect of our present response to future catastrophe.

A sociologist, Charles E. Fritz of the National Academy of Sciences, specializes in disaster response. Contrary to the rusty canards about behavior, people act splendidly dur­ing a disaster or catastrophe, he says. With exceptions, of course, they don’t loot, flee the scene in panic, or become hysterical (as in the movies.) On the contrary, people pull together and quickly move toward the center of the trouble instead of away, and so on. Team spirit is such that they organize and rebuild fast, like Germany and Japan after World War II. There is, of course, psychological pleasure in such an effort. In Britain today there is a real nostalgia for the war, when Britons felt they had a collective purpose.

This sort of response is so univer­sal as to amount to human nature. It is different, however, before the disaster, because then the culture operates. People cling to their cherished routines, habits, and be­liefs. They won’t recognize what’s in store, even when the signs are man­ifest showing what Fritz calls “a tendency to interpret disaster clues within a framework of normal ex­pectations.” The expectation we cherish most and the habit we most blindly stick to, is the ability to consume. We practice consumption like circus animals trained to dance, and without consumption what would we do, strive for, be?

So, we do not prepare for the storm because we would have to change our habits, our goals. And that is too hard and too painful. We know we should change and so, we are fright­ened. For unlike catastrophes of the past, the new ones demand foresight and preparation.

Given the nature of the challenges and the likely shape of our response left to itself, the finale seems more or less inevitable. Plato, in “The Republic,” theorized that only philosopher-kings were fit to rule. We shall have not a philosopher, but an ecologist king, a scientist! He will tell us what to do, direct our activities, supervise our habits, punish us if we refuse to obey orders. Perhaps a quondam freedom of speech will survive, or some foofaraw about voting, but down the road lies tyran­ny, however benign.

And after that? Will the last man on Earth please turn off the lights? ♦","Mon, 06 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.villagevoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_a_FI_1975_0120_01_Preview-of-coming-disasters.jpg,"['population', 'food', 'million', 'reallife', 'energy', 'nuclear', 'catastrophes', 'world', 'catastrophe', 'likely', 'scientists', 'heat', 'magnitude']",

One of the key measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic is social distancing, yet the poorest people on the planet don't have the luxury of space to do this.

The high density living conditions in the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh are having a serious impact on the physical and psychological well-being of the refugees, especially on children, women and refugees with disabilities.

The Rohingya community face not only the challenge of living in overcrowded and flimsy shelters with up to ten or more people in one room, but they also use communal latrines and water facilities and space is limited where they receive food distributions. They cannot maintain the proper distancing or hygiene measures to provide effective prevention against the spread of the coronavirus.

They are a people whose lives are dominated by a number of emergency situations: the violent and traumatic uprooting from their homeland in Myanmar, the health emergencies such as dysentery and pox which they face in the camps and the repeated climate emergency they face when cyclones batter Bangladesh. This is even without considering the global pandemic which is now bearing down on Bangladesh.

Meanwhile, heavy rainfall is weakening the shelters where the Rohingya take refugee, there is a high fear of landslide and flood, a fear of eviction and unresolved tensions between Rohingya and the host community people.

COVID-19 in Rohingya camps

The first case of COVID-19 was found in the Rohingya settlements on 14th May 2020. As of 21st June 2020 there was a total of 4 deaths and 45 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the Rohingya population.

But we don't know how accurate these numbers are as there is a lack of expertise in the testing centres. The medical facilities in the Rohingya camp are not really enough considering the size of the population and only primary health care facilities are available in most cases. The Bangladeshi government has limited the activities in the camps since 25th March.

Initially, Rohingya who were critically ill with COVID-19 were referred to Ukhiya General Hospital or Cox's Bazar Medical College. Now it is not possible because these hospitals are facing challenges to provide treatment facilities to the local people.

Many rumours about COVID-19 are floating inside the camps and far too few people have the proper information. Caritas Bangladesh is working across the country and in Cox's Bazaar camps to provide prevention messaging to tens of thousands of people. We have been providing soap and hygiene kits to thousands of family, as well as installing handwashing stations in public places and near toilets.

In order to ensure coronavirus messaging reaches as much of the community as possible, Caritas Bangladesh trains staff and volunteers, consults the community, establishes listening groups and shows awareness films. We distribute child-friendly flyers to ensure all members of the community are armed with information.

We ensure the Rohingya people now know how to deal with the pandemic. They know that they need to wash their hands frequently, but a big challenge is the poor water supply and sanitation facilities at the camp.

Recently, the Rohingya people have expressed serious concerns about the rainy season causing a deterioration in camp roads, paths, and stair networks thereby impacting access to necessary services and amplifying a multitude of protection issues such as physical and sexual abuse. Annual monsoon preparations in the camps were made more challenging this year by the spread and risks posed by the COVID-19.

The rights of the Rohingya community

Rohingya refugees have continued to undertake dangerous sea journeys organised by traffickers and smugglers. Bangladesh authorities in the last month rescued and safely disembarked nearly 700 Rohingya refugees following a long and harrowing journey at sea.\ The international community must recognise the rights of the Rohingya community for justice to be done and for anything to change in their lives. The Rohingya must have their rights to live in their own land freely and with dignity recognised and be safely and peacefully repatriated to Myanmar.

Rohingya such as 12-year-old Nur has a right to an education in her mother tongue and to live in her homeland. Refugees such as Jubayer, 72, would like the right to die peacefully in his homeland and be buried with other family members.

As yet another emergency hits these vulnerable people, we must work on all levels to ensure there is an end in sight to their suffering.","Fri, 26 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/rw-logo-social-media.png,"['ensure', 'preventing', 'spread', 'community', 'camps', 'covid19', 'rights', 'refugees', 'bangladesh', 'facilities', 'rohingya']",

At least 19 houses and public properties including the hostel of Passindang Secondary School have been damaged. No casualties have been reported so far as civilians were evacuated on time.

As per the information from SDM Dzongu Norbu Tshering Bhutia, 19 houses have been damaged by the flash flood and 35 families were evacuated to the Passingdang PHE house on the Passingdang-Lingthem road. The affected families were provided with ration by the district administration.

Dzongu has been cut off from rest of the state as multiple landslides occurred in the past few days due to very heavy rainfall across the state. The worst-affected area is Passindong, about 10 km from Mangan. A massive landslide came down from uphill Panang which damaged houses, government secondary school, roads and other infrastructure. The slide broke out around 8 pm on Saturday night.

District authorities and Dzongu MLA Pintso Namgyal Lepcha reached the spot which is accessible only on foot due to a slide near Sangakhalang, the entry point to Upper Dzongu. District authorities fear more landslides will come if the rains continue. Rural Development and Management Minister Sonam Lama also visited the area to assess the damages.

Land Revenue Department’s District Project Officer Karma Dorjee highlighted how the incessant rain over last 3-4 days of having triggered the flash flood in Passingdang in Dzongu. “The flash flood began from a Jhora (Stream) and has spread across 300-400 feet. Jhora got filled with rain of the last few days, the culvert was unable to hold on the increased water flow. With houses being on either sides of road, visually we can say seven houses have been damaged including a School. The flash flood has dragged a lot of flora, roads are blocked, and it was these damaged houses that shielded the flash flood from further spread,” he said.

There are reports of damages even at the distrct captial Mangan with two houses losing its foundation structure. Pakshep en route has 4-5 houses needing evacuation, Singhik also needing almost same number of evacuation while 4-5 houses, while in Malling ward 8-9 houses were damaged by landslides.

Land Revenue and Disaster Management Secretary PN Sherpa informed that the District Disaster Management is at the spot, along with other district officials, assessing the damage and supporting preventive measures. “It was last night’s incident with accessibility being a major issue, the road to North Sikkim is blocked from Sangklang onwards. The State Disaster Management Team is reaching the spot tomorrow. We have not send the team from Gangtok yet as connectivity is lost currently. NDRF team from Pakyong in East Sikkim is on stand by but the North District Officials are facing concerns with the logistics, so they have are on stand by for now. Currently, District Disaster Management Team is assessing the situation,” Sherpa said.

There have been no casualties, the damages are at multiple place and any information is premature, right now informed the Secretary.

Former chief minister and SDF president Pawan Chamling, upon hearing the news, vide a press release, said, “I understand that flash flood has wrought large-scale devastation. I am very concerned and am thinking of the dear people there. I am hopeful that the government will do all it takes to mobilize its machinery and reach out to the people as soon as possible. Let there be no short supply of relief materials and all kinds of help. The administration must never forget that the victims of such natural calamity deserve more than exemplary generosity. Nothing can really compensate for the loss caused. We need to be extremely careful of these phenomena and keep a close eye on areas prone to landslides and flash floods”.

Adding to its list of cover ups are three stories. The first is of Zhang Zhan -- a citizen journalist who reported from Wuhan during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic.

She has been reportedly charged by Chinese authorities.

She stands accused of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble"" through her reporting on the outbreak.

During her time on the ground in Wuhan she posted what she saw on social media, including Twitter and YouTube, platforms which are both blocked in China but accessible by using virtual private networks.

Zhang also penned an article critical of the Chinese government’s strict response to the outbreak, raising allegations authorities were covering up the true scale of the epidemic.

The citizen journalist was detained by Shanghai police in May, two days after her last uploaded Youtube video.

Apart from silencing dissenting voices, China has also hidden a flood. And no, this is not a metaphor.

The Chongqing Municipal Hydrological Monitoring Station on Monday (June 22) issued its first red alert flood warning in 80 years for the Qijiang River. It is predicted that there will be severe flooding in the area within 8 hours.

Reports say roads have been buried under four metres of water. And people have been trapped inside their homes.

But China -- as observed -- is trying to hide this.

And why?

Because this flood washes away China's careful narrative.

It calls itself an infra superpower, and has been using infrastructure projects to tighten its grip on the world.

The Three Gorges Dam, one of the largest hydropower projects in the world, faces a potential collapse due to the flooding.

China, of course, denies this. But the pictures speak for themselves.

Infrastructure development has been the backbone of china's world domination plans. And the Belt and Road Initiative was its vehicle. But it has broken down.

Projects are delayed; participating nations want debt relief; and China is losing contracts.

The latest setback comes from Kenya.

A Kenyan court has declared a railway contract with china illegal.

As of late June, India had the fourth-highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world, at more than 525,000. In May and June, the country also was hit by two destructive cyclones, just ahead of the onset of the monsoon season. India now faces the dual challenge of containing a pandemic in the face of natural disasters. Climate changes further complicate the process, as the intensity of natural hazards in general is forecast to increase.

Researchers say it is time to start a modeling effort that brings together these threats.

Bigger Storms, Bigger Problems

Two cyclones ripped through eastern and western India between mid-May and early June, felling electric poles and disrupting power to hospitals and quarantine centers.

First, Super Cyclone Amphan, with wind speeds reaching 260 kilometers per hour, pounded the states of Odisha and West Bengal in eastern India before moving on to Bangladesh. Two weeks later, Nisarga, a severe cyclone with wind speeds reaching 118 kilometers per hour, tore into Maharashtra in western India, blowing away the roof of a hospital just north of Mumbai. Maharashtra was already struggling with the country’s highest number of coronavirus cases.

The cyclones have heightened concerns about the coming monsoon. “The biggest worry is that we hit an unavoidable trade-off between emergency response and outbreak containment,” said Colin Carlson, a global change biologist at the Center for Global Health and Security at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. “For example, when a cyclone hits, if we have to evacuate people from their homes and shelter them together, we might expect a localized outbreak to be basically inevitable. But we don’t have a great strategy for emergency response that prevents that.

“Natural disasters can impact the [COVID-19] pandemic directly through disrupting health services and health infrastructure, as well as making social distancing more difficult among people displaced by a natural disaster,” said Christopher Trisos, director of the African Climate and Development Initiative at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.

Natural disasters could also impact COVID-19 control measures indirectly by disrupting clean water supplies and stretching government budgets already struggling to cope with the pandemic response, Trisos added. Trisos and Carlson are part of a team that authored a paper in Nature Climate Change on compound climate risks in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although monsoon showers bring welcome relief to a Sun-scorched India, climate scientists have been cautioning that the rainfall pattern has become increasingly erratic in recent decades. This shift comes in tandem with a rise of 10%–30% in extreme rainfall events over the central Indian subcontinent, attributable to climate change.

“During monsoon season, this year we are expecting many heavy rainfall events and associated floods,” said Madhavan Nair Rajeevan, secretary of India’s Ministry of Earth Sciences. “This could hamper the COVID-19 activities.” Evacuation of people from disaster-hit areas to shelters could add more risk to COVID-19 spread, he added. Indeed, monsoon-triggered floods have already displaced hundreds of thousands of people in northeast India in 2020.

Expanding the Modeling Efforts

Indian climate scientists have developed several models to understand the impact of global warming on the country’s temperatures and rainfall, as well as the impact of climate change and monsoon on mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue. But they have yet to develop models to predict the impact of natural disasters on pandemics, specifically on COVID-19.

In May, India’s Department of Science and Technology (DST) launched an Indian National Supermodel initiative to serve as a common platform for future modeling efforts. Its priority is to create a composite robust model that can predict the spread of COVID-19, DST secretary Ashutosh Sharma said, and could eventually address natural disasters.

Although the combination of natural disasters and epidemics needs to be addressed, the focus at first should be “on making sure the COVID-19 model is as comprehensive and well benchmarked as possible,” said Gautam Menon, a professor of computational biology and biophysics at The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.

Meanwhile, Menon’s team is developing India’s first large-scale “agent-based simulation model,” a dynamic system with inputs from different interacting entities, or agents, focused on COVID-19 in India. The researchers are partnering with Ashoka University, Sonipat, and the global software company ThoughtWorks.

“More detailed agent-based models have been used to model the consequences of natural disasters for disease spread abroad but not, so far as I know, in India,” Menon said, and not yet for coronavirus. Such models will help scientists compare different interventions, such as relief camps, a lockdown or a local quarantine, and even levels of individuals’ compliance to such control measures. Such models “will provide a powerful tool for decision-making,” Menon said.

India already has several “robust” models to forecast the impact of monsoon and other natural hazards on vector-borne diseases, said Rajan Patil, an epidemiologist at the SRM Institute of Science and Technology in Chennai. For example, links between monsoon, climate change, and vector-borne diseases (such as malaria, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya, and visceral leishmaniasis) can be modeled as shifts in water and weather patterns influencing the life cycle of the bugs that carry the pathogens or the pathogens themselves.

Similarly, Indian scientists have developed models on the impact of natural hazards such as droughts, famine, and even earthquakes on vector-borne diseases. A few predictive models focus on more regular weather, such as winter conditions and respiratory diseases such as asthma, tuberculosis, and measles and the impact of summer weather on heat strokes and diarrhea, Patil said.

However, Patil cautioned that it is too early to talk of modeling the impact of the monsoon on COVID-19, as knowledge about the new virus is still evolving. “For the virus as well as for us as researchers, the coming monsoon is the first monsoon we will be facing with COVID-19,” he noted. He said that scientists need to observe how COVID-19 behaves during the monsoon for a minimum of 2 years to make future predictions. By then, the pandemic may be over—or continuing, making it even more urgent to incorporate coronavirus into climate and weather models.

DENVER, COLORADO, UNITED STATES, July 1, 2020 / EINPresswire.com / -- MassiveCert, a leading provider of flood certification data and services, has released Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Zone data for 142 million properties nationwide. This is the largest Flood Zone identification effort ever undertaken, and the results are surprising. First Street Foundation, a non-profit technology group, is using the data for their Flood Factor website and Flood Lab research.FEMA is charged by Congress to create Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) for the Nation but the responsibility to determine the flood zone for any specific property is left to companies like MassiveCert who interpret the maps and FEMA’s flood zone rules. MassiveCert leveraged terabytes of geospatial databases containing property boundaries, building footprints, property records, digital flood maps, and federal insurance eligibility to determine which flood zone correctly applies to each building. The data was processed in the cloud across 40 virtual computers applying MassiveCert’s proprietary technology.“Producing a dataset of this quality at this scale is an incredible operational feat,” says Eric Ratcliffe, Chief Operating Officer and co-founder of MassiveCert. He added, “It’s an extremely complicated process to identify the buildings and decide which flood zone is correct for 142M buildings. In addition to the flood zone, we identified Base Flood Elevation, ground elevation, and other FEMA flood zones that are found on each property.”Of the 142M properties, MassiveCert found 8.7M to be in FEMA’s 100-year floodplain. But FEMA’s records show only 2.6M flood insurance policies, out of 5M policies FEMA has issued, are for 100-year flood zones. So only about 30% of the properties MassiveCert identified as in the FEMA 100-year flood zone are carrying federal flood insurance.“This was a property-by-property analysis across the U.S.”, says Ratcliffe. “Any project at this scale will have a percentage point here or there to be considered, but it just doesn’t account for only 30% of the 100-year flood properties having insurance. It’s a real shock to see the numbers as they played out. We see entire communities devastated with floods and yet so many people just don’t have flood insurance to recover.”Why aren’t there 8.7M federal insurance policies for FEMA 100-year flood zones?That is a complicated answer. To begin with, 14% of the Nation, by area, does not have a flood map for reasons such as: some communities do not want them, very low population areas, low development areas, or areas with no flood risk potential. And there are some exceptions to the rules, which means if you are in a 100-year flood zone there are circumstances that may exempt some buildings from buying flood insurance.The private flood insurance market is growing by offering competitive rates compared to FEMA, so many polices are now in the private flood market rather than with the government. That could explain some of the missing flood insurance policies, but it isn’t enough to account for such a severe lack of coverage.Federally backed lenders, which is nearly every lender, must require the borrower to get flood insurance on buildings located in 100-year floodplains when originating a mortgage. Lenders are regulated and files are checked to make sure flood insurance is purchased. There are relatively few violations for missing flood insurance policies reported by the regulatory agencies which indicates the lending and insurance communities are largely complying with the regulations.The final answer to the Nation’s flood insurance gap may lie in the rules themselves and how we identify and communicate flood risks. Americans can then go beyond the rules and federal requirements and make their own decision to be protected from floods.“The storms and floods are getting worse and everyone needs to know their flood zone as the first step to understanding how exposed they are,” says Josh Price, President and co-founder of MassiveCert. He further states, “MassiveCert’s mission is to make access to flood data and flood certification ‘massively easy’ because that is the path to national flood awareness. Through this partnership with First Street Foundation, we put information and power into the hands of property owners. No matter what the federal rules are, we’re trying to make every American aware of their own personal flood risk so they can do something about it.”","Wed, 01 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.einnews.com/images/ein_logo_transparent.png,"['massivecert', 'fema', 'street', 'data', 'federal', 'provides', 'zone', 'foundation', '100year', 'nationwide', 'flood', 'insurance', 'rules', 'properties']", 
92,92,FL-2020-000161-BGD,A “Himalayan Challenge” for Assam - Northeast Now,https://nenow.in/opinion/a-himalayan-challenge-for-assam.html,"Rocky Orang (24), Rajkumar Tanti (30) and Lohro Orang (48) of Dighaltarang Tea Estate under Doomdooma circle in Assam’s Tinsukia district went fishing with five others in the Dangori River on June 26. But their boat capsized and the three were washed away by the surging waters.

Reports of two youths–Bishnu Tanti and Iliyas Khal of Bisakupi Tea Estate washed away by the surging waters of the Dangori River came the next day taking the overall flood fatality in the State to 23. Flood waters also washed away the bridge that connects Doomdooma to Baghjan where a massive fire broke out after a 14-day uncontrollable oil leak from a damaged oil well at OIL’s production well site.

The washed away bridge made the operations more complicated to bring the fire under control. Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal took stock of the situation and asked the deputy commissioner, Tinsukia to lay one Bailey bridge to ensure unhindered movement of vehicles engaged in emergency services.

On Monday, reports of dead fish and other aquatic birds and animals floating on the Maguri-Motapung beel created panic among local people.

Irawati Narah’s family performed the last rites of the deceased woman in a boat as no high ground was in sight in the Chabua Revenue Circle of Dibrugarh district. The Dibru and the Dangori rivers are in high spate while the Brahmaputra, flowing a little distance away creating flood fury from Sadiya to Dhubri. The flood situation in Dibrugarh spread to 120 villages besides inundating most of city of Dibrugarh.

In Tinsukia, over 60,000 people from 140 villages of the district had been severely affected. More than 50 relief camps were set up in the district. For some 1,800 families– evacuated after the blow-out and staying at the dozen–odd relief camps of Baghjan and Dighaltarang—things become more complicated as flood waters inundated relief shelters.

“It has become an ordeal to even use the toilets. With living conditions worsening inside the make-shift relief camps, how can you think of social distancing?” asked one of the inmates of a relief camp at Guijan. Altogether 640 of families from greater Natun Gaon area were forced to take shelter in two schools at Guijan as an aftermath of the inferno at Baghjan.

The second surge of flood devours most of Assam’s flood-prone districts amid community transmission of COVID-19 cases. An alarmed administration grappling dual surges of a severe flood and more severe COVID-19 spread have developed an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) for relief camps which has been distributed to every district so as to deal with the Covid-19 situation as the number of positive cases show an upward swing. The Chief Executive Officer of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), MS Manivannan, assured that they are well-prepared to take on this dual challenge.

At least 200 relief camps were set up across the state where some 30,000 people had taken shelter, said an ASDMA release. To deal with the challenge of COVID-19 from spreading in the relief camps, ASDMA has drawn up standard operating protocol that defines the capacity of each camp so that people are not pushed to more vulnerability. As many of the flood-hit districts have quarantine camps, any suspected COVID-19 case in a flood relief camp would be sent to the nearest quarantine centre, stated the guidelines.

A “Himalayan Challenge” for Assam

The Assam government geared up arrangements for return of most people who were stuck outside the state and their quarantine facilities before June 10 so that the state could shift its focus to flood preparations. On May 3, Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma during an interactive session with senior journalists said that the state authorities has been dealing with a Himalayan problem because it has to organize tackling flood in the course of the monsoon season and the outbreak of the Japanese encephalitis, while controlling the COVID-19 spread.

“By August 15, Assam typically witnesses flood and Japanese encephalitis, and so, the state is dealing with a “Himalayan challenge”, said Sarma.

But by the last week of May the season’s first flood, triggered by cyclone Amphan, wreaked havoc in the state. Nearly three lakh people in nine districts of the state had been severely hit.

With floods, cases of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) had also been reported from some districts of Assam. The Mission Director of National Health Mission (NHM) in Assam confirmed three cases of JE and 79 cases of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) from the districts of Cachar, Dibrugarh, Sonitpur, Kamrup, and Morigaon. So far, there have been no deaths. Assam reported 154 deaths from JE last year. The combined number of deaths due to JE and AES last year was 600.

After an initial low count of COVID-19 cases when the lockdown started, Assam has seen a spike in the numbers with eased travel restrictions and more people returning home. On an average, the State is now getting around 250 positive cases every day, and half of them are from Guwahati.

The State government has enforced a complete lockdown in Kamrup Metro district for 14 days from Sunday night as well as impose night curfew from 7 pm to 7 am across the State from Saturday and weekend lockdowns in towns and municipal areas till the COVID-19 situation improves. Only pharmacies and hospitals will operate during the 14-day lockdown in the city besides a few emergency services. “We have been forced to take the tough decision and we are taking it with lot of pain. We are left with no other option,” said the health minister.

Rains and dam induced devastation

Heavy monsoon rains lashed India’s Northeast since the third week of June. Incessant rainfall and release of dam water further worsened the flood situation in Assam impacting about half a million people in 1, 289 villages in 61 revenue circles of 21 districts. Hundreds of thousands were displaced from their homes. State authorities warn of a worsening situation with prediction of more rainfall.

Dhemaji is the worst-hit with four deaths and more than 200 villages affected, followed by Tinsukia, Dibrugarh and Majuli. Ferry services to Majuli have been suspended.

The floodwaters also took a heavy toll on livestock. More than 70,000 livestock have so far been affected over 40,000 hectares of crop area have been submerged states ASDMA bulletin.

The second wave of flood inundated much of the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, situated in Mayong Revenue Circle in Morigaon district. The Kaziranga National Park, the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park, Manas National Park, Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park and Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary were inundated by the recent wave of flood.

The flood situation worsened with neighbouring Bhutan releasing over 2700 cumecs of excess water from Kurichu dam, about 30km from Barpeta Road in lower Assam on Thursday that led to the swelling of Beki, Manas, Pagladia, Kaldia and Pohumara rivers, affecting lower Assam districts.

Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal taking stock of the prevailing flood situation directed the different district administrations to keep constant vigil over the water level in their respective districts, especially in the wake of reported release of water from Bhutan.

Last year, the minister of state for Jal Shakti Rattan Lal Kataria informed the Lok Sabha that Assam has nine of the 39 most flood-prone districts in the country and Dhubri tops this list. The minister was referring to a report submitted by a committee headed by the Ganga Flood Control Commission (GFCC) while answering to a question by Dhubri MP Badruddin Ajmal.

According to the report, the nine most flood-prone districts of Assam are Dhubri, Lakhimpur, Morigaon, Dhemaji, Barpeta, Jorhat, Goalpara, Sivasagar and Nalbari.

Breach at Subansiri dam site create panic

Reports of damage of infrastructure and breaches in embankments poured in from different places. Although the State chief minister had, on April 30, directed the water resources department to complete all repair work on weak and breached embankments before the onset of monsoon the annual job of repairing river embankments came to a halt with the country-wide lockdown on March 25. Resentment grew along the banks against the administration for in-complete projects of embankment repair, maintenance and also anti-erosion work.

Floods and river-bank erosion pose a grave risk for the entire Brahmaputra valley. Globally, the Brahmaputra river system is perhaps the only one known for its loss of about 100 square kilometres of land every year due to bank erosion.

On May 26 part of a guard wall of the 2000 MW Subansiri Lower Hydroelectric Project (SLHP) breached. Moreover, erosion at the dam site created panic and riparian anxiety as a coffer dam was washed away. The NHPC authorities issued a clarification on local newspapers on Sunday stating that breach of downstream coffer dam and river flowing above the dam during monsoon is a normal event.

The clarification also stated that slope failure in diversion channel along left bank road is due to prolonged flow of water in diversion structures and is in no way related to the safety of the dam. The slopes shall be repaired after monsoons during the balance construction period after which the Diversion Tunnels shall be plugged. Earlier, the NHPC stated that the erosion site was 500 metres away from the main dam and would not make any impact.

The recent events led to protests by various organizations reiterating the apprehensions expressed by experts on the selected site for the mega-dam of the present dimension which is sensitive geologically and seismologically.

The Assam State Action Plan on Climate Change (2015-2020), states that climate change plays a major role as seen in the recent patterns in flooding in Assam. From April to late September—the state witness number of surges that would cripple the state’s economy each time. Further, thoughtless construction of dams on rivers in the name of flood control and the careless operation of dams have converted floods into a disaster.","Tue, 30 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://nenow.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Flood-Pobitora-by-Chandan-Kumar-Duarah-scaled.jpg,"['state', 'situation', 'himalayan', 'dam', 'districts', 'covid19', 'cases', 'assam', 'flood', 'district', 'relief', 'challenge']", 
93,93,FL-2020-000161-BGD,The people who are losing their homes due to climate change - The Boar,https://theboar.org/2020/07/people-losing-homes-climate-change/,"As the world faces an increasingly aggressive climate crisis, communities are vulnerable to devastation. At the end of 2019, 5.1 million people were living in displacement following natural disasters. The year saw 2000 global disasters, triggering 24.9 million internal displacements. This is triple the number of displacements caused by conflict and violence, and the figures will inevitably continue to surge. The UN forecasts that there could be up to one billion environmental migrants by 2050.

Behind the statistics are stories of horror and human tragedy. Individuals are losing their homes, their livelihoods, and their loved ones. In May 2020, the ferocious Cyclone Amphan tore across Bangladesh and eastern India. Costing an estimated $13 billion in destruction; the aftermath of this natural disaster has destroyed thousands of lives. A 63-year-old man, Shabitri Midha, described how “I have become a beggar now. All I had was a small hut, God snatched even that from me.” Midha lives in the village Pakhiralaya in the Sundarbans. Over the last 30 years, his ancestral land has slowly been flooded by the Bidyadhari river. All he had left was a small hut. “Now,” Midha says, “this storm has just finished us.”

Another victim of the cyclone’s rage, 51-year-old Bhim Bhangi, said that “never in our lives have we witnessed such a storm.” Bhangi had invested all of his life’s savings into three ponds, but today “everything is gone. All I have is over 300kg of dead fish.” In Bangladesh alone, more than 2 million people were evacuated. Many lives were saved, but people are returning to find their homes devastated. A mass evacuation is complicated under any circumstance, and this year the coronavirus pandemic has intensified dangers. People were not only reluctant to leave their homes but deeply anxious about the threat of contagion. Within days, Bangladesh prepared 10,500 additional shelters so that evacuees could be accommodated with some measure of social distancing.

The UN forecasts that there could be up to one billion environmental migrants by 2050

Yet in other areas of the world, Covid-19 is having a horrific impact on the lives of refugees. Cyclone Idai struck Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Malawi in March 2019. More than a year later, amid a global pandemic, 200 families in Zimbabwe remain in refugee camps. In their crowded living conditions, infection rates will spread like wildfire. Jani Maipse lives with his wife and seven children at Nyamatanda camp. With lockdown measures in place, he cannot leave to look for work.“I am struggling to make ends meet,” he says. “The little we hear on the radio is that we need to maintain a social distance, but how is that possible when you are nine in a single small tent?” Vulnerable people are disproportionately affected by the crisis. Both the pandemic and climate change will have a catastrophic impact on refugees. These are people who have been forced to leave their homes, families and lives. They are likely to face yet more harrowing suffering.

The UNHCR has pointed out that refugees are often placed in climate change ‘hotspots’ and exposed to secondary displacement. As Joan Rosenhauer, executive director of the Jesuit Refugee Service, said: “Imagine having fled your home after violence was imminent for you that threatened your life. You’re trying to settle into a home and place with almost no resources. You’re living in a strange place with a mud hut. And then [imagine] having it all flattened by a storm. You’ve had to leave everything behind and you’ve lost everything already once, and now twice.” Climate change will not only trigger the migration of millions of people, but it will also have terrifying consequences for those who are already displaced. The trauma of losing a home is unimaginable to many of us. Yet it is a reality that we must confront. According to Rosenhauer, “there are projections that by 2100, 48 countries around the world will be lost due to rising sea levels. Clearly those are all people who are going to have to leave their homes.”

Climate change will not only trigger the migration of millions of people, but it will also have terrifying consequences for those who are already displaced

Meanwhile, natural disasters are becoming more frequent and more violent. Elisabeth Tabary, who was living in La Faute-sur-Mer when Cyclone Xynthia crossed Western Europe in 2010, is haunted by memories of disaster and loss. She remembers the night Xynthia took her home, and with it the lives of her husband and two-year-old grandson. As their house started to flood, she climbed up the kitchen door. Her grandson was in her arms. She had to watch her husband drown. Hours later, her grandson died of hypothermia. “At that point,” she said, “I wanted to drown myself.” 29 people lost their lives to storm Xynthia in La Faute-sur-Mer. Many more lost their homes. Almost half of the town’s population decided to leave, but Elisabeth stayed. She fears leaving would be like “abandoning the members of my family who died here.”

Nature has a terrifying power. It can be vicious. Its impact is often catastrophic. At the end of last year, this was hauntingly evidenced when Australia became engulfed in flames. The Australian bushfires were more devastating than any climate scientist had predicted. Land the size of South Korea was left scorched. Neil Ward, a natural resources and conservation manager, described how painful it was to return to his home after it had been ravaged by fire. He compared it to “a scene that we generally associate with bomb attacks or the worst cyclone.” The iron roof seemed to be all that was left of the house, its walls “completely swallowed by the fire.” Within the ash and debris, Ward found “forks and spoons welded together, delicate feathers of ash that were once books, light fittings hollow and black, rocks in the garden split and singed from the heat.” It was no longer their family home, but a scorched reminder of what they had lost.

These people who have lost their homes, and their lives, are not just statistics

There are millions of stories like this, stories of lost homes and lost lives. There will be many more to come. Climate change is a reality that we must face. It is causing so much tragedy, and that can no longer be ignored. These people who have lost their homes, and their lives, are not just statistics. They are individuals, and their suffering cannot be forgotten. We must continue to tell their stories and accept that the climate crisis is a nightmarish reality that has taken hold of the world.","Wed, 01 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://theboar.org/wp-content/themes/theboar-theme/img/icons/favicon.ico,"['lives', 'losing', 'storm', 'natural', 'lost', 'world', 'change', 'living', 'climate', 'leave', 'homes']",

Chilli prices were between Tk 150 to Tk 180 per kg on Thursday at retail markets which was Tk 100-130 a week back.

Stored potato of cardinal and diamond varieties' prices went up to Tk 30-35 a kg from Tk 28-30 a kg.

Potato of carriage variety price increased to Tk 40-42 a kg.

Most of vegetables, continuing the upward trend in prices, witnessed Tk 10-20 hike per kg in a week, according to kitchen market sources.

Traders attributed the hike of vegetables to heavy rain and flood in many districts which affected supply chain.

Lokman Hakim, a vegetable vendor at Dhanmondi-15, said prices of green chilli was Tk 700 a palla (5 kgs) at Karwan Bazar on Thursday which was Tk 450 a week back.

He said price of the spice has gradually been increasing for last two weeks like all vegetables.

Kamal Hossain Mithu, a potato and spice vendor at Rayer Bazar, said prices of potato witnessed Tk 130-150 hike per 50 kg sacks in a week.

Golam Kibria, a Karwan Bazar based chilli and vegetable wholesaler, said crop fields in Bogura, Jamalpur and Tangail have severely been affected by rain and flood.

He said green chilli supply from big hubs like Jamalpur, has already been halted due to flood.

Vegetable supplies from 14 districts have been interrupted due to flooding and inundation, he added.

Golam said transportation cost is still as high as Tk 2.5-Tk 3.0 which was Tk 0.75 to Tk 1.0 per kg before the COVID-19 virus outbreak.

He said price would remain higher for next few weeks before removal of flood water.

According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), more than 150,000 hectares of Aus, Aman seedbed, veggie and chilli fields have been inundated in two weeks due to flooding on 16 districts so far.

Above 7,000 hectares of chilli fields have been damaged by flooding and rain in Bogura and Jamalpur, the two key hubs.

However, water level in major rivers in Brahmaputra-Jamuna basin, which declined for last two days, might started increasing again in next 24 hours, according to the report of the state-run Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC).

Water level in Upper-Meghna basin might also surge in a day, said FFWC forecast of Thursday afternoon.

SANGAREDDY: Two days of relentless rains in Jharasangam mandal, in the upstream region of Singur Project, has led to the flooding of Dabba Vagu in Munipally mandal. It is likely that the water from the Vagu would flow into the project soon.

According to officials concerned, 500 cusecs of water has come into the project till date. In fact, in the last four years, there has been no flood-water flow into the project.

The officials further said that if the rains continued, there were chances of the flood water welling up the project.

The Irrigation Department said that heavy rains were expected in the catchment areas of Manjeera and Singur projects. On Sunday, 35.8 mm of rainfall was recorded in Jharasangam mandal, 27.0 mm in Raikode mandal and 17.2 mm in Munipally mandal.

by Anuradha Varanasi | July 8, 2020

Malgosia Madajewicz, an associate research scientist at Columbia University’s Center for Climate Systems Research (CCSR), has learned from experience that communities vulnerable to climate change are hungry for opportunities to improve their livelihoods.

Working with communities in New York City, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Jamaica, and Tanzania, Madajewicz has seen how important it is to involve local citizens in planning for climate change impacts. The economist has observed that whether or not people benefit from an intervention depends on how well it is tailored to the local environment, regardless of how good the underlying science is. She says the only time communities become resistant to climate change “assistance” is when it is poorly designed for people’s needs in the local context.

Madajewicz’s family migrated to Buffalo, New York, when she was 13 years old. “I grew up in communist Poland and my parents were refugees when I was still a teenager. It has been a long road for me to become an economist,” she says. Her curiosity about the abject wealth disparities across the globe resulted in her earning a Ph.D. in economics at Harvard University.

Since then, her work has focused on developmental issues and more specifically, on how communities that are the most vulnerable to climate change can sustain their livelihoods and adapt to climate change. In a conversation with State of the Planet, Madajewicz talks about the social sciences aspect of climate change adaptation and her latest research work.

As an economist, how did you carve a niche for yourself in climate change adaptation and management of climate risks?

It was mainly driven by my interests. I am a development economist. While working in different countries, I realized how the impacts of climate change are fundamental to addressing every development issue that there is.

I also became increasingly conscious of this being the biggest crisis humanity has faced in a long time. It became difficult for me to think about anything else. I knew that to remain motivated in my research and passionate about what I’m doing I need to simultaneously understand the impacts of climate change and what society can do about them.

So, I joined the International Research Institute for Climate and Society [at Columbia University] in 2007, where I was focusing on finding approaches to climate risk management in developing countries. I continue to have projects in developing countries in both rural and urban areas. But, after Hurricane Sandy, I also started studying climate impacts in urban areas of the northeastern U.S. after moving to CCSR in 2011.

As a member of the Consortium for Climate Risk in the Urban Northeast (CCRUN), can you tell us more about how communities have been coping with coastal flooding and sea level rise?

It was surprising to observe that few people have begun to adapt to increasing risk of flooding driven by sea level rise. I found that one of the major issues was the lack of access to information about flood risk that is sufficiently specific to inform decisions about what people can do. Communities simply don’t have the information required to plan ahead and prepare.

Where did these coastal communities go wrong while rebuilding their homes post-Hurricane Sandy?

They spent all of their money on rebuilding their homes exactly how they were before the natural disaster hit them. The boilers and water heaters went back into the basement exactly where they were before. There was an opportunity at that time to build resilience for the future and it was missed. And unfortunately, it was missed at a big cost because the communities along the coast in NYC are not particularly wealthy. They are low- to middle-income communities. These homeowners wiped themselves out financially, so today they are far more vulnerable to future storms and sea level rise than they were before Hurricane Sandy.

One of my ongoing projects is engaging with coastal residents to develop collaboration within their communities. And to also provide them with information that they could use to prepare for future floods. This includes educating them about the costs of not adapting to future flooding — that is, the costs of future flood damages in the absence of adaptation — and adaptation options.

I was also studying whether access to relevant information affects behavior, and which other policies are needed to spur adaptation action. Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic is wreaking havoc with that project. The entire project is based on workshops and face-to-face engagement with residents. So we’re on pause at the moment.

What kind of climate change adaptation measures do you think the homeowners should have taken while rebuilding post-Hurricane Sandy?

They could have replaced all those electric utilities higher up in the house where they would be out of the way of future floods. That way, people wouldn’t lose access to electricity. New York City is currently working hard to upgrade its electricity infrastructure to build resistance against future storms. If people had done their bit on their end in the homes, they might have not suffered the kind of electrical outage that lasted from weeks to months after Hurricane Sandy in some places.

What is the most frustrating part of being an economist in the climate change sector?

Most attention is focused on climate science and models of the physical environment. But, relatively little attention is being paid to how people make decisions, how information and policies influence decisions, and how decisions and policies influence outcomes that people care about and that determine livelihoods. Those are critical linkages. Resilience and adaptation are going to be built on people’s behavior — things that people choose to do or not to do. And then their ability to do those things with the incentives that might be provided. That part of the picture is receiving less attention at the moment.","Wed, 08 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.climate.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Madajewicz-081816_3.jpg,"['malgosia', 'adaptation', 'face', 'madajewicz', 'information', 'future', 'communities', 'change', 'seas', 'research', 'economist', 'risk', 'climate', 'decisions', 'studies', 'rising']",
