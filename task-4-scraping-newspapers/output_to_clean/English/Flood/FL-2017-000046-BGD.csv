The demonstrations came after the Rakhine Advisory Commission, led by former UN chief Kofi Annan, urged Myanmar’s government to reconsider the ethnic group’s legal status. The government actually does not recognise the existence of Rohingya and rather considers them as Bengali.

Stripped of their basic rights, community members have been submitted to extreme violence and atrocities in Myanmar. More than 87,000 people have been displaced since October. For years now, many have fled to neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh, where they live a life in limbo.

Bangladesh has some 32,000 registered refugees in two official camps located mainly in the Cox’s Bazar district bordering the eastern Rakhine State. An additional 200,000 to 500,000 unregistered refugees live in makeshift camps there, alongside locals.

Having faced a continuous flow of Rohingya refugees for over two decades, the Bangladesh government is now planning to relocate the refugees to a remote island in Noakhali district, Thengar Char, about 250 km northwest of current camps.

The government says the move would improve refugees’ access to humanitarian assistance. But Rohingya refugees reportedly oppose the plan, and human rights groups have urged the government to cancel the plan, which the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network has declared to be “dangerous, absurd and inhumane”. Rights groups argue that the island is uninhabitable: it rose from the sea only 11 years ago and is highly prone to flooding and cyclones.

Local integration

The Bangladeshi people of Cox’s Bazar and the Rohingya refugees share a common dialect and culture. As a result, law enforcement forces cannot always differentiate between refugees and locals. Despite restrictions on their ability to work, many refugees find employment in the informal sector, and some children go to local schools. The government has reluctantly allowed the refugees to stay so far, but it is clearly concerned that such opportunities will lead to integration.

Thengar Char is a remote island in the most literal sense. The nearest sub-district office, Hatiya, is two hours away by boat. The surrounding areas are poor and underdeveloped.

For the government, it is easier to manage a refugee population that is concentrated on Thengar Char. Locals there do not speak the same dialect as Rohingyas, decreasing the potential for integration. It will also be practically impossible for them to seek employment and education outside the camp.

Challenges for humanitarian agencies

But the relocation would also make it very difficult for the UNHCR/UN Refugee Agency International Organisation for Migration and local NGOs to provide humanitarian services. Currently, agencies are mainly based in Cox’s Bazar, a popular Bangladeshi tourist destination with the longest sea-beach in the world. It is well connected to Bangladesh and other parts of the world by land and air and offers staff the comforts of living in a city, including basic facilities and security.

Thengar Char, on the other hand, is an exceptional place in overpopulated Bangladesh: it has no human settlement. Villagers who live nearby complain of pirates roaming the nearby waters, stealing goods and holding people hostage. The area’s security risks and remoteness may discourage humanitarian agency staffers from relocating there.

Possibilities of a human catastrophe

The Bangladesh forest department has warned that the Thengar Char island is not yet suitable for human habitation, writing in a letter that:

The soil and environment of Thengar Char is not yet suitable for human settlement. The island is submerged in water during monsoon. Though it emerges during dry season, most of the island goes under water at high tide.

Cyclone are of significant concern. According to a catalogue of tropical storms in Bangladesh, 193 cyclones struck the country between 1484 and 2009. Arguably the deadliest tropical cyclone in history hit the region in 1970, battering the coast with a six-metre storm surge and killing some 300,000 people. If even a small-scale cyclone hits the proposed Rohingya camp, a human catastrophe is nearly certain.

The Noakhali district administration has written that the government would also have to “build flood protection embankment, cyclone centres and necessary infrastructure and ensure supply of drinking water” before receiving the Rohingyas in the Thengar Char.

Lost connections

For the Rohingyas, current border camps in Cox’s Bazar are close to home not just culturally but also geographically. For some, crossing into Bangladesh is as easy as wading through a little creek on foot or taking a short boat trip.

When Myanmar erupts in violence, many Rohingyas seek safety in Bangladesh, and, when it ends, some of them head back home. There is usually no asylum application, refugee-status determination procedure or UN-assisted voluntary repatriation; registration was last done in 1992. The country’s hundreds of thousands of unregistered Rohingya migrants live in limbo, as Bangladesh lacks specific refugee laws.

During relative peace, many Rohingyas also cross the border to seek medical treatment, education, marriage, daily shopping trips, or to visit relatives. Some will embark on a secondary migration, heading to Saudi Arabia or Malaysia. Many of these practices likely violate Bangladeshi law, but they are locally accepted and have been going on for generations.

Newly arrived refugees or migrants often get shelter and other assistance from relatives already living in Bangladesh’s camps. Many refugees in the camp also act as bridge between Rohingyas living in Myanmar and the diaspora of approximately one million others who live around the world.

Indirect force for repatriation?

Bangladesh has been negotiating with Myanmar to repatriate the Rohingyas. Many Rohingyas in Bangladesh have expressed their willingness to go back to their homeland if state authorities can ensure their safety.

However, the risk of persecution and violence in Myanmar remains high, and most refugees do not consider it safe there. International law requires that the Bangladeshi government only send back refugees who would voluntarily repatriate.

If the alternative to life in Myanmar is banishment to Thengar Char, many Rohingyas might “agree” to return rather than face a dangerous and uncertain future on a remote island of Bangladesh.

1,1,FL-2017-000046-BGD,Why India and Bangladesh Need a Resolution on Teesta Water Sharing - The Wire,https://thewire.in/diplomacy/teesta-water-india-bangladesh,"During the upcoming visit of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to India, from April 7-10, the most important issues the two countries are expected to discuss is the deal on releasing about 48% of waters from the Teesta river to Bangladesh. This despite the fact that, according to a news report in The Daily Star, “Teesta water-sharing treaty is not on the agenda”.

Teesta is the fourth largest transboundary river shared between India and Bangladesh, after the Ganges, Brahmaputra and the Meghna (GBM) river system. The total catchment area of the GBM is about 1.75 million square km. The Teesta originates in the Indian state of Sikkim and its total length is 414 km, out of which 151 km lie in Sikkim, 142 kms flow along the Sikkim-West Bengal boundary and through West Bengal, and 121 km run in Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, the river mainly affects the five northern districts of Rangpur Division: Gaibandha, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari and Rangpur. According to a report on the Teesta by The Asia Foundation in 2013, its flood plain covers about 14% of the total cropped area of Bangladesh and provides direct livelihood opportunities to approximately 7.3% of its population.

Where the dispute originated

Historically, the root of the disputes over the river can be located in the report of the Boundary Commission (BC), which was set up in 1947 under Sir Cyril Radcliffe to demarcate the boundary line between West Bengal (India) and East Bengal (Pakistan, then Bangladesh from 1971). In its report submitted to the BC, the All India Muslim League demanded the Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri districts on the grounds that they are the catchment areas of Teesta river system. It was thought that by having the two districts, the then and future hydro projects over the river Teesta in those regions would serve the interests of the Muslim-majority areas of East Bengal. Members of the Indian National Congress and the Hindu Mahasabha opposed this. Both, in their respective reports, established India’s claim over the two districts. In the final declaration, which took into account the demographic composition of the region, administrative considerations and ‘other factors’ (railways, waterways and communication systems), the BC gave a major part of the Teesta’s catchment area to India. The main reason to transfer major parts of Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri to India was that both were non-Muslim-majority areas. Darjeeling had a 2.42% Muslim population while Jalpaiguri had 23.02% Muslims. The League’s claim was based on ‘other factors’.

During East Bengal’s days as a part of Pakistan, no serious dialogue took place on water issues between India and East Pakistan. After the liberation of East Pakistan and birth of a sovereign Bangladesh in 1971, India and Bangladesh began discussing their transboundary water issues. In 1972, the India-Bangladesh Joint Rivers Commission was established. In its initial years, the most important concerns of water bureaucrats from both countries were the status of river Ganges, construction of the Farakka barrage and sharing of water from the rivers Meghna and Brahmaputra. Although the issues related to the distribution of waters from the Teesta were discussed between India and Bangladesh, the river gained prominence only after the two countries signed the Ganga Water Treaty in 1996.

In 1983, an ad hoc arrangement on sharing of waters from the Teesta was made, according to which Bangladesh got 36% and India 39% of the waters, while the remaining 25% remained unallocated. After the Ganga Water Treaty, a Joint Committee of Experts was set up to study the other rivers. The committee gave importance to the Teesta. In 2000, Bangladesh presented its draft on the Teesta. The final draft was accepted by India and Bangladesh in 2010. In 2011, during then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s visit to Dhaka, a new formula to share Teesta waters was agreed upon between the political leadership of the two countries. But West Bengal’s chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who was then in a coalition with the Union government, opposed the agreement. Even when the Narendra Modi government accepted the new arrangement between India and Bangladesh, Banerjee did not. In 2015, during Modi’s visit to Dhaka to exchange the ratified papers of the Land Boundary Agreement between India and Bangladesh, Banerjee joined him. But she maintained a silence over the issue of sharing Teesta waters.

Current issues

Although Article 253 of the Indian constitution gives power to the Union government to enter into any transboundary river water-related treaty with a riparian state, the Centre cannot do it arbitrarily without taking into consideration the social, political and economic impact of such a treaty in the catchment area.

One of the reasons for Banerjee not accepting the new deal on the Teesta is confusion over the agreed percentage of water to be shared between India and Bangladesh. The deal says that Bangladesh will receive 48%of the waters. This means, as Rupak Bhattacharjee has written, Banerjee believed in 2011 that Bangladesh would get something around 33,000 cubic feet per second (cusec) of water annually, instead of the 25,000 cusecs originally agreed upon in earlier meetings to finalise the new agreement. She has said that releasing so much water to Bangladesh would affect irrigation systems in five districts of the North Bengal – Coochbehar, Jalpaiguri, South and North Dinajpur, and Darjeeling – which constitute some of the poorest blocks in her state.

In 2011, the West Bengal government commissioned a study on the Teesta issue under the hydrologist Kalyan Rudra. He submitted his findings in the form of a preliminary report to the West Bengal government in December 2012. The detailed report is not publicly available, but Rudra’s academic writings on the Teesta issue are well known. In a paper published in The Ecologist Asia in 2003, Rudra had been critical of the big projects on the river like the Teesta Barrage Project in Jalpaiguri district and hydropower projects of the National Hydro Power Corporation (stage III and IV) in the Darjeeling district of West Bengal. He wrote, “Siltation has been a major problem, with projected capacities decreasing at alarming rates, often before the entire project is completed! Evaporation from the reservoirs and seepage of water from canals deprived the marginal land of the command area from the water that it was assured during the planning of the project. The dams that were designed to moderate floods have created floods by releasing excess water at the peak of the monsoon.” The paper supports an idea to reduce the burden on the Teesta by slicing down the number of multi-purpose hydro projects on it. This would help the river provide enough waters for irrigation purposes, he said.

On the issue of sharing Teesta waters between India and Bangladesh, it is being assumed that Rudra’s study has probably proposed a 65/35 or 60/40 division of waters during the monsoons and on a 70/30 ratio during the dry season, when both North Bengal and northwestern parts of Bangladesh face drought situations. This basis would certainly not be acceptable to Bangladesh, where the water from river Teesta is mainly required during the leanest period, from December to April. The demand turns (at worst) between March and April, when the water flow from Teesta often goes below 1,000 cusecs from 5,000 cusecs.

The success of the deal on the Teesta is considered to be a political necessity for both governments. The deal, as anticipated, will help New Delhi get more political leverage, which, it thinks, is necessary to check the rising influence of an extra regional power – China – in the Bay of Bengal region. For Hasina, the deal will support her chances to retain political power in the 2018 general elections in Bangladesh by projecting her as a leader who can secure her country’s interests and not a ‘pawn’ in the hands of India, as she is being often called by opposition groups.

2,2,FL-2017-000046-BGD,'India cannot ignore our rights to Teesta water' - Dhaka Tribune,https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/environment/2017/03/31/india-rights-teesta,"We need this treaty because we need to know how much water we are going to get from the Teesta during the dry months so we can plan our agricultural projects accordingly. India has completely dried out the river on our end during lean period by closing all the gates of the Gazaldoba barrage. That is unexpected from a friendly neighbour. This treaty is a formality, but India cannot ignore our rights to the river water. Ideally, this treaty should have two mechanisms: ensuring water flow in the dry period and managing water for the rest of the year in the entire river basin. In addition, it should ensure prevention of flood and river erosion during monsoon. Teesta's dry period starts in October, and monsoon starts in April-May. I think the crucial period in the Teesta is September-October, when supplementary irrigation is needed in some areas of the river basin for agriculture. During dry season, the Teesta gets around 6,000 cusecs of water [1 cusec = 28.32 litres per second]. But Bangladesh needs 8,000 cusecs and India needs 16,000 cusecs. Without releasing more water in the river, it is impossible to meet these demands. My second concern is flood. The Teesta overflows during monsoon. Its water flow typically exceeds 300,000 cusecs, but we have a record of Teesta's water flow exceeding 450,000 cusecs one year. In addition, we face massive river erosion in the Teesta during monsoon. To tackle these issues, we need effective flood management, which can easily be achieved by building a reservoir in the upstream.We heard in the news that Mamata Banerjee claimed the Indian union government did not discuss the details of Teesta treaty with her. But I think the issue is not related to West Bengal. The issue is between two central governments. That means Delhi has to talk to Dhaka and decide on equitable water sharing. But it is said without the West Bengal government's consent, the central government of India cannot go into an agreement with Bangladesh. That is absolutely wrong. When Bangladesh and India discuss sharing water of a trans-boundary river, the state government has nothing to say because the issue is within two central governments.The Ganges treaty is supposed to be reviewed every five years, but it has never happened. The treaty is renewable without any condition. I believe Bangladesh will be able to renew it, but the discussion should begin in the next two years. Also, this time the treaty should not be time-bound. [caption id=""attachment_54387"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""800""] Teesta barrage, an establishment which many in Bangladesh accuse for desertification of northern districts of the country. The picture was captured in early May, 2016[/caption]At the moment, Bangladesh has no way of knowing what is happening in the upstream Ganges. But Bangladesh and India signed a cooperation agreement in 2011, which means the terms of river management between the two countries can be negotiated. It is time for us to discuss some of the terms. According to the Ganges treaty, the upper riparian country should ensure that the volume of water increases gradually. The water flow in the Ganges was good, but after 1975, India has been withdrawing water from the river at different points. But the treaty asks both the countries to ensure water flow in the river for proper basin-wise river management. If Bangladesh can continue the discussion with all stakeholders, the problems regarding water sharing in all trans-boundary rivers could be resolved.Basin-wise river management is a classic idea. It has been implemented for all international rivers, like the Rhine, the Colorado and the Mekong. The demand and availability of water varies in the upstream and downstream of a river. Usually, the water flow in the upstream surpasses the demand, while it is the opposite in the downstream. The optimum solution to balance the supply and demand could be creating proper modelling of the rivers based on water quantity and quality. This way, we can resolve issues like flood, navigation, irrigation, hydro-power and fisheries for the entire basin of a particular river. All this is covered by basin-wise river management.There is no need to bring all the countries to a single platform. A commission should be formed to deal with the issues regarding one particular trans-boundary river. For example, for the Brahmaputra, Bhutan, China, India and Bangladesh should form a joint commission and deal with Brahmaputra basin management. [caption id=""attachment_55764"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""800""] Teesta barrage, an establishment which many in Bangladesh accuse for desertification of northern districts of the country. The picture was captured in early May, 2016[/caption]Bangladesh has been receiving a certain volume of water through Farakka barrage during lean period. If we divert one-third of that water to the southwestern districts of the country, it will help to reduce the salinity in that region's water. That can be done only with the barrage in Goalanda. There is no alternative, to my knowledge. Using my experience on this issue, I can say that there is no relation between Farakka barrage and the flood in Bihar. Bihar Chief Minister Nitesh Kumar demands for opening the barrage gates. Of its total 108 gates, four or five always remain closed due to technical problems. If they open those five closed gates, there won't be much difference in the water flow. Kumar's actual demand is to keep the gates open from May to September. He also wants the removal of sediment in the upstream of Farrkka barrage, which is a technical matter.He is somehow under the impression that the barrage gates remain closed during monsoon, and that is what causes flood in Bihar, but it is not true. The problem is, political leaders can be led to the wrong conclusion too.If you are building something with money borrowed from someone, they will demand a say in the project. But that will not happen if you make it with your own money. India built Farakka barrage with its own money, so they had all control over it. However, I believe the Ganges barrage should be built jointly with India.","Fri, 31 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2017/03/WEB_Teesta-Barrage-Abu-Siddique_24.03.2017.jpg,"['india', 'flood', 'teesta', 'water', 'treaty', 'barrage', 'ignore', 'gates', 'bangladesh', 'rights', 'flow', 'river']",

Professor Michael Mann said extreme weather events – such as the “unprecedented” drought in California last year, the flooding in Pakistan in 2010 and the heatwave in Europe in 2003 – were happening more often than they should do, even taking the warming climate into account.

This, he said, meant there had to be an additional factor.

​Jetstreams are influenced by the difference in temperatures between the Arctic and the equator.

But the Arctic has been warming much faster than tropical climates – the island of Svalbard, for example was 6.5 degrees celsius warmer last year compared to the average between 1961 and 1990. The land has also been warming faster than the sea.

Both of those factors were changing the flow of these major air currents to create “extreme meanders” which were helping to cause “extreme weather events”, Professor Mann said.

Last year, another leading climate scientist warned that the rapid rate of warming in the Arctic could have a “catastrophic” effect on the weather in the northern hemisphere.

In a paper in the journal Scientific Reports, Professor Mann and other researchers wrote that evidence of the effect of climate change on the jetstreams had “only recently emerged from the background noise of natural variability”.

They said that projections of the effect on the jetstreams in “state-of-the-art” climate models were “mirrored” in “multiple” actual temperature measurements.

Professor Michael Mann, of the Pennsylvania State University, said: “The unprecedented 2016 California drought, the 2011 US heatwave and 2010 Pakistan flood as well as the 2003 European hot spell all belong to a most worrying series of extremes.

“The increased incidence of these events exceeds what we would expect from the direct effects of global warming alone, so there must be an additional climate change effect.

“In data from computer simulations as well as observations, we identify changes that favour unusually persistent, extreme meanders of the jetstream that support such extreme weather events.

“Human activity has been suspected of contributing to this pattern before, but now we uncover a clear fingerprint of human activity.”

The jetstream normally flows reasonably consistently around the planet, but can develop loops extending north and south.

The researchers, who studied temperature records going back to 1870 as well as satellite data, said these loops could grow “very large” or even “grind to a halt” rather than moving from west to east.

The effect has been most pronounced during the past 40 years, they found.

“The more frequent persistent and meandering jetstream states seems to be a relatively recent phenomenon, which makes it even more relevant,” said Dim Coumou of the Department of Water and Climate Risk at Vrije University in Amsterdam.

“We certainly need to further investigate this – there is some good evidence, but also many open questions.

The Walumba Elders Centre was built in Warrmarn (Warmun) following flooding in 2011 that destroyed the town's previous facility, and damaged much of its housing and other buildings.

""Some 350 Gija People were forced off their homelands until the houses and infrastructure were re-built over the next two years,"" said Iredale Pedersen Hook Architects, which was tasked with designing the replacement care home.

The new structure is located next to a community school, and is raised 2.4 metres above ground level to avoid future flooding.

The intention is for the building ""to act as a focal point for bringing the community back together, and to aid in the transmission of the unique aboriginal lore, Gija language and cultural knowledge to the younger members of the community"", according to the architects.

Its layout is organised as two parallel wings, joined at one end by a faceted roof that soars across a rotunda and extends down both branches of rooms.

Accommodation for both self care and high-level care is provided. A variety of factors inherent in Aboriginal culture had to be taken into account with the design.

These include gender separation, access to both public and private outdoor spaces, and hosting ceremonies that may involve fire and smoke.

Concrete piloti are used to support the elevated structure, while corrugated metal is used to clad the majority of the building. Multiple staircases lead down to ground level, which is subtly landscaped.

""The concept relates to a bridge not only as physical infrastructure but also as a passage of knowledge between generations, and as a place of care and respite before the possibility of passing from this existence to the next,"" said the architects.

Walumba Elders Centre was lauded in the Health Care and Wellness category at the 2016 A+Awards.

5,5,FL-2017-000046-BGD,Sustainable rice production key to food security - Down To Earth Magazine,https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/sustainable-rice-production-key-to-food-security-57492,"Though a staple crop in many countries, rice production is facing the impact of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods

As we face the onslaught of climate change, the key to improving food security in developing countries lies in sustainable rice production. Rice-based farming systems can greatly benefit small-scale farmers, especially women, and help end hunger in these countries.

According to Maria Helena Semedo, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) deputy director-general, rice is critical to global food security. Over three billion people across the globe eat rice every day.

Rice is one of the world’s staple cereals, along with wheat and maize. It has been estimated that by 2050, the annual global demand for maize, rice and wheat will reach almost 3.3 billion tonnes. According to the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), rice production needs to increase by 25 per cent in the next 25 years to meet global demands.

Fighting climate change

In many countries, especially Southeast Asia, rice is a staple crop (around 97 per cent of rice is grown in Asian countries). At the same time rice production is facing the impact of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods. According to the IRRI, about 20 million hectares of rice land is prone to flooding. In India and Bangladesh alone, more than 5 million hectares of rice field are flooded during most planting seasons.

Take the example of Vietnam for instance. In an interview to Down To Earth, Vietnamese farmer Pham Thi Huan blamed saline soil and mangroves for impacting rice cultivation in her country. To counter this, rice varieties resistant to drought and salinity developed by the Mekong Delta Rice Research Institute were planted. To make rice cultivation sustainable, Huan encouraged women farmers to go in for integrated rice and duck farming to supplement their income.

FAO’s “save and grow” method takes into account the sustainability factor when it comes to world’s staple cereals. Under this unique method, farmers are encouraged to produce more with less. The method also advocates natural ecosystem processes. One such example practised in China is the rice-fish farming system wherein farmers rear fish in flooded paddy fields.

This has twin advantages. While on one hand, the fish can be sold for extra income or eaten for nutrition, on the other hand, growing fish along with rice helps in controlling fungi and weeds that damage the crop. It thus reduces dependence on pesticides.

According to food policy expert Devinder Sharma, integration is good for making more money for farmers. However, rich-fish farming best works for wetland paddy.

“Rice-fish is a traditional system that has been largely replaced by intensive rice mono-cropping. We are now seeing, in countries like Indonesia, a revival of aquaculture in rice fields,” FAO’s deputy director of plant production and protection division William Murray told Down To Earth earlier.

Achieving sustainability

As rice farmers are among those most vulnerable to climate change, the Sustainable Rice Platform recently established the world’s first standard for sustainable rice. Through this, the IRRI aims to maintain yields for rice farmers and reduce environmental footprint of rice cultivation.

Rice-fish is a traditional system that has been largely replaced by intensive rice mono-cropping. We are now seeing, in countries like Indonesia, a revival of aquaculture in rice fields

Rice cultivation uses a lot of water. But there is no denying that it is linked to livelihoods, Sharma said. While talking about emissions reduction in agriculture, Meryl Richaards, agroecologist at CGIAR (Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research) Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security advocated alternate wetting and drying of paddy. “By reducing the frequency of irrigation (letting the fields drain periodically), methane emissions from flooded rice production can be cut in half,” she said. Though the practice was originally developed to save water, it has potential to be adaptive to climate change as well.

Lal said this during the first session of a three-day seminar hosted by the Indian Council for Historical Research (ICHR) in the national capital.

""Archaeologically, the deluge of Saraswati river took place around 2000-1900 BC or say broadly in the first quarter of the second millennium BC. This was exactly the time of Manu's flood, which occurred after the Rig Veda but before the beginning of second millennium BCE (before common era). Should we still call Manu's flood a myth?,"" the paper presented by Lal read.

Lal was presenting a paper on — 'Testing Ancient Indian Literary Traditions on the Touchstone of Archaeology: Manu's flood'.

Manu is a term found with various meanings in different mythologies of Hinduism. In early texts, it refers to the archetypal man, or to the first man. According to Hindu texts, Manu was warned of flood by a fish after which he he built a boat to save the vedas, the myth is similar to other flood myths like that of Noah in Christianity.

""Saraswati died around 1900-2000 BCE after tectonic movements that created a ridge obstructing the river's path, caused the river to deluge and create havoc in the adjoining region. This is around the same time that Manu's flood also happened. So can we call it a myth?"" said Lal.

Imagine growing up amidst the hustle and bustle of Calcutta during the seventies. Utpal (64) and Samita Chaudhuri (59) met in the City of Joy, and soon realised that they have more than the campus of Jadavpur University to share.

A common love for nature brought them closer as Sikkim soon became their calling. They trekked the Himalayas together and twirled along the Teesta river– as students, as lovers, and as a married couple. When their daughter was born, they named her Teesta.

Teesta

Teesta met her namesake when she was eight months old, and again when she was four. But fate was cruel. She fell sick at 11; ‘an incurable disease’ was what the doctors said. Two years later, at the age of 13, Teesta passed away. “My father died the next year, and four years later, my mother left us. Suddenly our home was empty, and we had nothing left to look forward to,” Utpal says.

And The Teesta Flows...

They never planned to write a book. Utpal and Samita can’t even say for certain why they went back to the mountains and the eternal river. They just did. Samita recalls,

“We went back again and again - mostly to North Sikkim. The gurgling sound of the rolling river on the embedded stones made us think of the sweet laughter and gaiety of our dear child.”

Utpal recalls how Tso Lhamo, India’s highest lake, and the birthplace of Teesta, filled their hearts with joy. It reminded them of their own daughter being born. Although there were strict restrictions on visiting the lake, which required special permission, they visited the place more than 40 times. The locals started to recognise them and they became friends. Utpal tells us,

“The people of Lachen and Lachung, the high altitude villages, were a bit indifferent in the beginning. But after our repeated visits, they slowly accepted us and invited us to stay with them. From eight to 80 all of them called us uncle and aunty.”

These villages are populated by Bhutias, who had migrated from Tibet in the thirteenth century. Despite language barriers, the couple, with help from younger interpreters, could communicate with the older members of the village. Utpal says,

“We came to know about the early periods of British interference in their lives. How the roads were built, how the domestic goats brought by outsiders at that time had infected the wild ones, and hundreds and hundreds of the latter died. When they were young, winter would see four feet of snow getting accumulated; but these days the depth is only 1 foot.”

The couple walked alongside the river, and before they know it, a journey by the river had begun - a journey that would chronicle the philosophies, lives and livelihoods, culture, folklore, diversity and emotions of the Bhutias, and several other people living by the Teesta.

Guru Dongmar Lake, North Sikkim

A deeply personal journey

The book Utpal and Samita eventually wrote over the next eight years is hard to categorise. And the Teesta Flows is a memoir and a dedication. It is also, at the same time, a travelogue filled with over 160 lively photographs of the landscapes, villages, and people, and a close study of the 309-kilometre-long journey the river undertakes as it flows through Sikkim, North Bengal before eventually meeting the river Brahmaputra in Bangladesh. What makes the journey more interesting is how the journey of Teesta is personified like that of a girl. Samita tells us,

“In the beginning, the river emerges from a mother’s womb, and slowly starts to grow. As it goes ahead, it leaps and dances like a teenage girl. In the plains, the river acts as a lady with all the intricacies of life. Likewise, we have divided the chapters of the book as ‘The Birth of the Teesta’, ‘The Growing Girl’ and ‘The Lady’.”

The river near Teesta Bridge, Jalpaiguri

The book quietly takes us on a poignant journey - where a river seen through the affectionate eyes of Utpal and Samita, and people and their lives merge. In the book, we meet the nature-worshiping Lepchas, believed to be the first settlers in Sikkim, who continue to face humiliation locally for their simple and docile lives. We meet the rural people of Bangladesh, who heavily depend on their rivers, even for transportation, and face the wrath of floods year after year. One can’t help but admire the strong social and environmental message the book manages to put across, despite remaining strongly personal and subjective.

Chronicling Lives

There is a section in the last chapter where the life of charuas is discussed. ‘Char’ is the fertile silt that gets deposited when the river changes course. ‘Charuas’ is a community of people who settled from East Pakistan during the partition, and locals who were rendered helpless during the changing social and political times. They cleared the forest and started living by the forever bountiful Teesta, but their troubles continue even today. Utpal says,

“We met a person, a charua, who told us that he had shifted his house 18 times. He has no grievance He says he will never be able to sleep at night if he doesn’t hear the splashing waters of the Teesta.”

The farming community of charuas also faces trouble from elephants, who rampage their crops frequently. They even grow extra crop for their large hungry visitors. “They plant banana trees or produce corn so that their own food is saved. We found that they have a great empathy for the elephants that come to their houses in search of food, and lovingly call them Ganeshbabu,” Utpal says.

The Teesta in Bangladesh

Utpal suffered from blood cancer immediately after finishing the Indian side of their journey chronicling Teesta. He underwent treatment for the next one-and-half years, and went back to the river even before the doctor allowed him to. He adds,

“There are hundreds of stories that we gathered from the people who live by the Teesta, and we wrote them down in this book because we feel that they deserve more ears. We met a person who sells peanuts on the banks in the daytime and writes poetry on the Teesta at night. We have met another man who lost all his family members in the devastating flood of 1968, and still writes poetry expressing his heartfelt sorrow. We have translated some of these poems and included them in the book.”","Tue, 28 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.yourstory.com/cs/wordpress/2017/03/yourstory-teesta-1.jpg,"['sikkim', 'daughter', 'lives', 'couple', 'utpal', 'met', 'lost', 'teestas', 'teesta', 'wrote', 'went', 'journey', 'chronicling', 'book', 'samita', 'river']", 
8,8,FL-2017-000046-BGD,Climate-change sceptic says they should have right to 'mislead public' because of free speech - The Independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/climate-change-sceptic-mislead-pulbic-inaccurate-statements-free-speech-plea-mps-a7657951.html,"A claim by a senior member of Britain’s leading climate sceptic think tank that ""misleading the public by making factually inaccurate statements” should be allowed has been dismissed by MPs.

Instead the Commons’ Science and Technology Committee called for a “robust redress mechanism” – possibly including fines – in cases where science is misreported by the media.

The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), set up by former Conservative Chancellor Nigel Lawson, adopts a ‘lukewarmist’ stance, accepting much of climate science – apart from the projections for the future.

It claims global warming will not cause significant problems, while the scientific evidence suggests the planet is on course for a range of possible outcomes with a greater chance of experiencing ‘dangerous’ weather conditions than avoiding them.

The GWPF has repeatedly been accused of misrepresenting the science and cherry-picking findings that appear to fit with its stance on the issue.

But in written evidence to the committee, Dr David Whitehouse, a member of the GWPF’s academic advisory council who was making his submission in a personal capacity, tried to make the case that such actions should be allowed in a free society.

“Some argue that free speech does not extend to misleading the public by making factually inaccurate statements. But it does,” he said.

“Being able to speak freely without censorship is fundamental to modern liberal democracies and is guaranteed under national and international law.

“Qualifications are made with regard to libel, slander and defamation and, in some countries, holocaust denial.

“The important point, and it took millennia and many lives to attain it, is that the freedom of speech principle does not mean that you have to be factually accurate.”

In a report, the MPs ignored this plea and made it clear they disagreed – particularly with regards to global warming.

They quoted Sir Mark Walport, the Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, as saying: “The climate debate is an example of where people have claimed to be experts who are not.”

The committee also highlighted evidence given by Imperial College London about the “continuing problem of misapplied ‘balance’ in the media’s science reporting”.

And the MPs' report added: “The Government should ensure that a robust redress mechanism is provided for when science is misreported.""

Ministers should still weigh the importance of scientific evidence but “where they do not follow the results they must ensure that they do not dismiss or discredit legitimate scientific evidence”, the report said.

In an age of claim and counter-claim about ‘fake news’, spin and misinformation about science risked causing real harm, warned Stephen Metcalfe MP, who chairs the committee.

“Robust consideration of scientific evidence is crucial to policy making and really affects our daily lives and we have seen over many years through the debates around BSE [‘mad cow disease’], climate change, [vaccine] MMR and new medical treatments,” he said.

“However too often the clever practice of communications overshadows the true advice of experts, and the public are left bewildered, and not knowing who to believe.

“This affects Government policy too, Ministers and decision makers must take greater care to set out exactly how scientific evidence is being considered, and ensure they cannot be accused of discrediting or skewing the evidence for financial reasons or to suit political aims.

“Reporting scientific and particularly health issues accurately is also a big responsibility for media organisations if they are to retain public trust, and we need to give the public greater reassurances that they are being properly informed and engaged.”

A team of Harvard University scientists led by Professor David Keith plans to begin a trial of a so-called ‘geoengineering’ project next year.

This will involve spraying fine particles of water and various materials, such as sulphur dioxide, from a high-altitude balloon.

It is thought doing this on a large scale would cool the planet in a similar way to the effect of the lightest debris produced by volcanic eruptions.

However such ideas are controversial with the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity agreeing in December that its moratorium on climate geoengineering should remain in place.

This is partly because such measures could have unintended consequences, such as causing drought in the Sahel region of Africa, as one scientific study suggested.

After the Harvard team unveiled their plans, Silvia Riberio, Latin America director at technology watchdog ETC Group, told the Guardian: “Clearly parts of the Trump administration are very willing to open the door to reckless schemes like David Keith’s, and may well have quietly given the nod to open-air experiments.

“Worryingly, geoengineering may emerge as this administration’s preferred approach to global warming.

“In their view, building a big beautiful wall of sulphate in the sky could be a perfect excuse to allow uncontrolled fossil fuel extraction.

“We need to be focussing on radical emissions cuts, not dangerous and unjust technofixes.”

Professor Daniel Schrag, of Harvard, said in a promotional video about their planned trial: “One aspect of the climate problem that people sometimes don’t appreciate is the timescale – the fact that a large fraction of the carbon we are putting in the atmosphere will still be there thousands, even tens of thousands, of years from now.”

But switching from fossil fuels to renewables, he claimed, would take “many decades and probably much more than a century”.

“Many of us who have looked at the energy systems of the world and the climate system have a feeling we may actually not be able to switch our energy system over in time to prevent the worst consequences of climate change,” Professor Schrag said.

“This is really why solar geoengineering is, I think, an important thing to look at very carefully.”

The research paper of the former director general of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the findings of which were arrived at by linking Manu's flood to the disappearance of the Saraswati river through archaeological evidence, was presented today at a seminar organised by the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR).

""Archaeologically, the deluge of the Saraswati took place around 2000-1,900 Before Common Era (BCE) or broadly, in the first quarter of the second millennium BCE.

Lal, a Padma Bhushan awardee, is also working on a book on the same subject. His book 'Rama, His Historicity, Mandir and Setu: Evidence of Literature, Archaeology and Other Sciences' had created an uproar as it talked about the possible presence of a Hindu temple structure beneath the Babri Masjid.

ICHR is a flagship research-based institution functioning under the Ministry of Human Resource Development.

The three-day seminar on 'Antiquity, Continuity and Development of Civilisation and Culture in Bharat (India) up to 1st Millennium BC' was slated to be inaugurated today by Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar. He, however, could not make it to the event.

ICHR Chairman Sudarshan Rao said the seminar aimed to find a connection among the various civilisations that spanned between 4th millennium BC and 1st millennium BC.

The 1st millennium BC, spanning from 1,000 BC to 1 BC and encompassing the Iron Age, saw the rise of various empires.

Rao claimed that the ancient civilisations between 4th millennium BC and 1st millennium BC were correlated and added that the seminar will seek to delve into this connection.

Twenty-six research papers would be presented during the seminar, which marks the 45th anniversary of ICHR which was founded on March 27, 1972.

The phenomenon was first noticed in 2011 and was something of a surprise as it had been believed that the water beneath the ice was far too dark for plants to photosynthesize.

But now researchers have established the reason the plankton can flourish in such a usually alien environment is that rising temperatures have melted the ice to the point where light can pass through.

The green shows the area of sea ice where plankton is able to grow (Christopher Horvat)

After developing a mathematical model, they concluded about 30 per cent of the Arctic sea ice is thin enough for this to happen, compared to just three to four per cent only 20 years ago, they reported in the journal Science Advances.

In addition to the thinning of the ice, large pools of water have been forming on the surface, which help the sunlight get through the normally impenetrable ice.

Sea ice has been at record low levels for much of this year with 14.1 million square kilometres on 28 March, compared to the average between 1981 and 2010 of 15.4 million at the same time of year.

The Arctic has seen astonishing rises in temperatures over the last few decades with Spitsbergen experiencing winters of up to 11 degrees Celsius warmer than the average between 1961 and 1990.

One of the researchers, Dr Chris Horvat, of Harvard University, said: “Our big question was how much sunlight gets transmitted through the sea ice, both as a function of thickness, which has been decreasing, and the melt pond percentage, which has been increasing.

“What we found was that we went from a state where there wasn’t any potential for plankton blooms to massive regions of the Arctic being susceptible to these types of growth.”

The thickness of sea ice in the Arctic has reduced by an average of about a metre in the past 30 years.

And Dr Horvat said this had “dramatically changed the ecology in that area”.

“All of a sudden, our entire idea about how this ecosystem works is different,” he said.

“The foundation of the Arctic food web is now growing at a different time and in places that are less accessible to animals that need oxygen.”

The blooms of plankton form the basis of the food web in the region.

Sea ice retreats and advances as summer turns to winter and normally the plankton will bloom in the open water, rather than under the ice. This attracts fish and also their predators.

The researchers said they hoped their model would help any future expeditions to the region to explore the effect of the changes on the Arctic ecosystem.","Wed, 29 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/29/15/arctic-green-climate.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['melts', 'change', 'plankton', 'arctic', 'turns', 'photographs', 'water', 'low', 'climate', 'believe', 'ice', 'green', 'doesnt', 'sea', 'levels', 'record']",

13,13,FL-2017-000046-BGD,Where is the data to support the government's rationale for linking the Ken and Betwa rivers? - Scroll.in,https://scroll.in/article/829772/where-is-the-data-to-support-the-governments-rationale-for-linking-the-ken-and-betwa-rivers,"Spades and shovels will soon hit the banks of the Ken river in Panna district of Madhya Pradesh. On February 11, a committee of officials from the Union Ministry of Water Resources and the NITI Aayog approved an investment of Rs 18,000 crores for a project that will channelise water from the Ken to the Betwa river, about 250 km away.

The Ken-Betwa project is the first in the Union government’s gargantuan Interlinking of Rivers project, which aims to link 30 rivers across India at a cost of about Rs 6 lakh crores.

The government argues that transferring water from what it calls “surplus” rivers to so-called “deficit” rivers will lead to a better utilisation of water for drinking and irrigation purposes, and reduce the possibilities of flood and drought.

But few people in Bundelkhand, the region straddling Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, where the project is being built, are convinced of its benefits.

Both Ken and Betwa rise from the Vindhya range in Madhya Pradesh and flow northwards towards Uttar Pradesh to eventually meet the Yamuna river. While the Ken flows through Madhya Pradesh’s Panna district, Betwa flows through Vidisha district.

At Daudhan in Panna district, a dam will be built to divert water from the Ken to Betwa through canals.

The detailed project report for the proposed link claims that this will facilitate irrigation for 6.35 lakh hectares in six of the 13 districts that form the Bundelkhand region – Chhatarpur, Tikamgarh and Panna districts in Madhya Pradesh, and Mahoba, Jhansi and Banda districts in Uttar Pradesh. The report also says that the project will bring domestic drinking water for 13.42 lakh people in the region and 78 megawatts of power from two hydropower stations.

The government’s rationale

The project is based on the theory that there are surplus rivers and deficit rivers.

But is the Betwa a deficit river?

It is true that by the time the Betwa reaches Bundelkhand, it is running low on water. Seven large and small dams built upstream hold water for Bhopal and Vidisha, leaving barely any water for places downstream.

There are more industries along the Betwa than the Ken. Even the irrigation needs are more pressing along the Betwa since large parts of upstream Ken are covered with forests, including the Panna Tiger Reserve.

Once the link is formed, the water diverted from the Ken is expected to reach downstream districts of Jhansi, Mahoba and the western reaches of Banda.



Opaque data, questionable claim

But ecologists question the assumption that Ken is a surplus river as compared to the Betwa. How does the government define the word “surplus”, they ask.

Currently, the government seems to be taking into account unutilised water from a particular river. This is derived after taking into account all the water-use potential of that basin – drinking water needs, appropriate irrigation, sewage utility and ecological needs of the river to rejuvenate itself. District-level officials collate this data and hand it over for tabulation at the state level.

The figures that show the Ken as surplus and Betwa deficient are not in the public domain.

The National Water Development Agency, which prepared the project reports for the Ken-Betwa link, refused to divulge the figures as both the rivers are tributaries of the Yamuna in the Ganga Basin. The Ganga flows through Tibet, Nepal, India and Bangladesh. Water sharing between these countries has been controversial and hence the hydrology of rivers in the Ganga basin remain a secret.

Asked whether experts have vetted the hydrology of the Ken and Betwa rivers, RK Jain, Chief Engineer at the National Water Development Agency, said that the Central Water Commission had taken a close look at these rivers and was satisfied with the figures.

Himanshu Thakkar, an environmentalist who studies dams and rivers in India, said the secrecy is disconcerting. “Unless we know that Ken is surplus and Betwa is deficit, how do we agree that this massive project is required?” he asked. “Two-thirds of irrigation in the country happens through ground water and the Ken basin is no different. This crucial figure is not taken into account by the government at all.”

River water is critical for ground water recharge. If the course of a river is changed, there will be no ground water recharge in specific areas. In this case, water from the Ken will be diverted to the Betwa from Panna district. Flowing through Chhatarpur district, it will connect with the Betwa in Tikamgarh district. Downstream areas of the Ken, such as agriculture-rich eastern parts of Banda district, will face a severe shortage of ground water as there would not be enough of a river flow to recharge it.

Floods to droughts

The government has also claimed that the river linking project will help tackle floods along the Ken by periodically taking water away from it.

Ecologists question this assumption. They say taking away water from Ken will imperil drinking water needs in downstream areas, especially during the summer.

In January, even the upstream reaches of the Ken were dry, with narrow streams of water flowing without continuity. Four small rivers – Sunaar, Biyarma, Midhasan and Galko – join the Ken at Powai in Panna district. The river, which should swell at Powai, was struggling to keep its head above the ground.

“Flooding in Ken is seasonal,” said Munna Maharaj, a farmer in Rengua village, who owns 15 acres of land on the banks of the river. Ken floods because of rocky structures that act as a natural dam. “All we need is for the government to increase the width of the river where the rocks form a natural dam,” he said. If the rocks are widened at the spot it would reduce seasonal floods significantly, he added.

Such a project would cost the government not more than Rs 20 crores, estimated Lallan Singh, who has a contract to construct a lake in Panna.

Said Maharaj: “Why spend Rs 18,000 crores when we can all benefit from not more than Rs 20 crore?”

Officials at the National Water Development Agency, however, believe that the cost of the Ken-Betwa link far outdoes the benefits, referring to the power-generation capabilities of the project, and the drinking water facilities to downstream areas.

But activists point out that both the Ken and Betwa are forest rivers that are born in the forests of central India. When Ken has a dry spell, so does Betwa. “Why are they proposing to link two rivers whose flow, rejuvenation and origins are similar?” asked Prem Singh, a farmer in Banda district.

Ecological balance

The impact of the project on the tiger reserve and the ghariyal sanctuary in Panna was also a matter of serious concern. “If you export water from Ken to Betwa, the tiger reserve will suffer substantially,” said Irene Cynthia, the district collector of Panna. “There were no tigers in 2008 and officials struggled to bring the numbers up. Today, we have 36 tigers in the reserve.”

The ghariyal sanctuary has just one reptile, according to the guards at the sanctuary entrance. “We need to save it desperately,” said Cynthia.

That is not all. Ken originates in the forests of central India. The proposed dam will be constructed at Daudhan, in the middle of the Panna Tiger Reserve, entailing the felling of more than 10 lakh trees. “How will the river rejuvenate itself without the forest?” asked a local worker of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Panna, who requested anonymity since he was speaking against his party’s stated position.

Fast and easy clearances

Activists are surprised at the speed with which the clearances came through for the Ken-Betwa river link.

In early January, the project was cleared by the National Green Tribunal and Union Ministry of Tribal Affairs. It received environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests around the same time. “Did the report mention that cutting 10 lakh trees at the heart of the country will change the ecology irreversibly?” asked Prem Singh, a farmer-activist. “Procuring an EC [environmental clearance] has become a joke.”

In August, to the surprise of many, the National Board for Wildlife also cleared the project.

“That was the most shocking,” said Gunjan Mishra, an environmentalist based in Chitrakoot, Uttar Pradesh. “How did the NBWL [National Board for Wildlife] agree to let go of 40 square kilometres of the Panna reserve? It is not the question of tigers alone. It is the entire ecosystem that gets affected because of that.”

In October, the Union Cabinet approved the River Ganga (Rejuvenation, Protection and Management) Authorities Order, 2016, which calls for the establishment of a national agency called the National Mission for Clean Ganga. Any construction or deforestation in the Ganga basin – of which Ken and Betwa are a part – will require clearances from this agency.

“How did Uma Bharti [the minister for water resources] announce that the Ken-Betwa link will kickstart without this crucial clearance?” asked Mishra.

The only roadblock for the project could be the funding pattern. The project falls under the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme, which mandates that the Centre contributes 60% of the funds required for a project, and the state takes care of the remaining 40%. The Ministry of Water Resources, which is keen on the Ken-Betwa project, has asked the NITI Aayog to change the funding pattern to 90:10 – or 90% funding by the Centre. The NITI Aayog is yet to agree. However, Minister of State for Water Resources, Vijay Goel, announced that all clearances and approvals for the project have been obtained and work will begin soon.

Meanwhile, in Panna, a quaint town with run-down buildings, most long-term residents believe that the Ken-Betwa link will transfer water from the Betwa to the Ken and not the other way round. “Ken is the smaller river, with a smaller dhaar,” said Jayshree Sharma, 67, referring to the flow of the river. “Betwa is the larger river. So water should come from Betwa to Ken.”

The popular understanding in the region shows that the government has done little to even inform Bundelkhand’s people of what lies in store for them.

The Gulf state plans to invest £119bn ($150bn) in renewable power to 2050, weaning the country from dependency on subsidised natural gas power in stages, Minister of Energy Suhail Al-Mazrouei said at a conference in Berlin. Clean energy sources will help it save £153bn ($192bn), he said.

The UAE leadership is “bullish” about achieving the goal after realising that the nation can forgo subsidies in the switch to clean power from liquid natural gas (LNG), Al-Mazrouei said. Sticking to the strategy will “save the environment and at the same time save us lots of money,” he said.

As the costs for solar power fall rapidly, Gulf and Middle East states are reevaluating their power strategies, which currently rely subsidiaries for electricity generated with LNG. The UAE has set an “incredibly ambitious” clean power target, starting from scratch just a few years ago, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

Recommended Denmark runs entirely on wind energy for a day

In September, Chinese panel maker JinkoSolar and Japanese developer Marubeni won a tender for a solar plant in Abu Dhabi with a record bid of 2.42 US cents a kilowatt-hour. About £795 million ($1bn) has been invested in utility-scale solar in the UAE since 2007.

Middle East states need to break their reliance on subsidised gas power, where inefficiencies are endemic in the Middle East, Al-Mazrouei said.

“We have so many open-cycle power plants it doesn’t make sense to continue with them - they’ve very low efficiency,” said the former Abu Dhabi Investment Authority executive. “The reason they are there is because gas is subsidised.”

In future, the UAE will review every proposed LNG power project as a project that’s not subsidised, he said. The government also wants to drop support for power tariffs, he said.

Shishmaref, Alaska (CNN) There's a cemetery in the heart of this Arctic village, its white crosses blending into a backdrop of snow. In the cemetery are two men I've come to Alaska to write about. Their names: Esau and Norman.

Their bodies are buried in the cemetery, I'm sure of it. I've seen the obituaries.

But neither man is dead.

No one in Shishmaref dies, I'm told -- not really.

It's about 9 a.m. as I trudge through the snow, past the cemetery and to a neighboring house. The sky is frozen in pre-dawn twilight. The sun won't rise for hours.

An elder answers the door and welcomes me into a living room that smells of sourdough and coffee. On the shelves, above a big-screen TV: dozens of figurines carved from walrus ivory, a tradition in this 560-person Inupiat village. How meta, I think. Walrus ivory carved back into the shape of a walrus, as if the animal were reincarnated from its own tusks.

Even walruses have a second life here, apparently.

The man offers me a seat and a coffee mug.

I'm here to ask him about Esau.

Yes, one of the men in the cemetery.

But also the 19-year-old born with the same name -- the hoodie-wearing kid with the faint mustache. The one, among many, who's trying to imagine another future for this village.

A future away from this island.

The blue house

Shelton and Clara Kokeok live in a blue house at the edge of the village.

Everyone knows Shishmaref isn't expected to last long.

Residents of this barrier island, located just south of the Arctic Circle, some 600 miles from Anchorage and only 100 miles from Russia, have been saying so for years.

To understand it, visit the tiny blue house at the edge of the land.

It's the edge of the Earth, really. And it's also the house where Norman grew up.

Norman, the second man in the cemetery.

Inside, an old woman sits in a wheelchair and an old man peers through the kitchen window at the Chukchi Sea. A cassette-radio buzzes with headlines from God-knows-where, but the man, Norman's father, isn't listening. Shelton Kokeok, a 72-year-old with palm-sized ears and a face that tragedy has worn into a grouper's frown, is focused on the ocean. He scans it in a state of unease; creases etch his forehead. Shelton, who once was a light-hearted man, and whose kind eyes and infectious smile still hint at happier times, will be nervous until the water is frozen cement-hard. Today, in mid-December, it is the texture of a snow cone.

""It's not really solid yet,"" he tells me, forlorn. ""Young ice, fresh ice, you know?""

These aren't bored-old-man concerns.

The ice is disappearing.

And then there's what happened to his son, Norman.

First, the ice.

Here, and across the Arctic, sea ice is forming later and thawing earlier.

That ice protects Shishmaref's coast from erosion. Without it, punishing storms grab hunks of the land and pull it out to sea, shrinking and destabilizing the island.

Look at where the coast was in 2004 -- and where it's expected to be in 2053.

Shelton's blue house is right on the edge of the receding coastline.

He worries it could fall in.

That happened to one of his neighbors.

A house fell off the edge of the land in 2006. The Kokeok home is shown in the background.

As the world warms -- thanks largely to the 1,200 metric tons of carbon dioxide we humans are pumping into the atmosphere each second -- the ice is disappearing. The planet has warmed about 1 degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution, when people started burning fossil fuels for heat and electricity, creating a blanket of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. But scientists say the Arctic, the far-north, is warming twice as fast as the rest of Earth.

""I miss that cold, cold weather,"" says Hazel Fernandez. I meet her in a community hall; she'd rather be fishing on the ice but says it's still too thin. ""It's too weird. It's too warm.""

Outside, thermometers show temperatures in the mid-20s Fahrenheit, or about minus 4 Celsius. That's freakishly warm for December, everyone tells me. I'm wearing two coats and ski pants, and residents of Shishmaref seem to find that hilarious. This isn't cold, they say. Their sealskin hats and mittens, the fur-lined hooded parkas -- those mostly stay at home.

Fernandez, in her early 60s, fondly remembers temperatures of 30- and 40-below Fahrenheit.

But mean air surface temperatures increased more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in the Arctic region between 1960 and 2011, according to the US National Snow & Ice Data Center. Arctic sea ice, measured since 1979, was at a monthly record low in January. And the September sea ice minimum is decreasing at a rate of 13.3% per decade.

The scientific consensus is that human pollution is driving these changes.

But it's not the science or the charts that matter most to Shelton.

It's not his blue house, either, perched precariously on the edge.

It's his son, Norman.

It's that day: June 2, 2007.

The day Norman fell through the ice and died.

Esau

The stories about Esau are easy to unearth.

Like people here, they never truly die.

""What was Esau like?"" I ask the elder whose home is next to the white crosses and the cemetery, in the heart of this village of wooden homes and metal-sided buildings, a place where the winter landscape is an infinity of white, where there's no running water or sewage service, where a shower costs $3.50 at the holiday rate, a 12-pack of Sprite $12.75. Most people prefer to live off the land, hunting seal, walrus and ptarmigan and fishing tomcod as their ancestors did.

The elder replies in a tone that is airy and patient, a voice measured through time.

Esau Weyiouanna was something of a renegade in Shishmaref, he tells me. He was an individual in a place that prides itself on community -- an opinionated, outspoken man in a village where many would prefer to blend with the environment. In a photo that hangs on a friend's wall today, Esau wears purple-and-green plaid and Napoleon-Dynamite bifocals, a knowing, understanding smile on his lips. His eyebrows are angled and inquisitive, like an owl's.

The local church in Shishmaref, Alaska.

Allow the elder to share one story.

Decades ago, the Christian church decided to ban some of the village's Inupiat traditions, which had been passed from one generation to the next for centuries, if not longer. The church believed some of these traditions defied the will of God and were incompatible with its teachings. Dancing, in particular, was banned. Children of Shishmaref no longer could gather with drums made of stretched walrus stomach to move their bodies in the same artful patterns their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents always had, the elder tells me.

Esau was the rare man who could see both sides of this dispute, the kind of man who straddled worlds both modern and ancient. He served on the church board, the elder says. But he also loved the Inupiat cultural traditions -- particularly the dance. So he took a stand. Esau danced boldly and in public, the elder tells me, to remind the community of the value of culture.

Today, the elder says, children are taught this dance in the local school.

This portal to the past remains open because of Esau.

Renegade, reborn

Decades later, and nearing death, Esau tried to ensure his story would continue.

He walked up to a pregnant woman and touched her stomach.

How am I doing in there? he asked.

It was a startling question, but up here in a world of ice, where no one really dies, or not for long, the meaning was clear to the mother. She knew Esau's body soon would be laid to rest in the cemetery, and that he would be reincarnated as the child still growing inside her.

Esau Weyiouanna was declared dead on October 29, 1997.

On November 16, the woman's child was born.

The family, following tradition, named him Esau.

Esau Sinnok.

A village renegade, reborn.

Norman

Shelton and Clara Kokeok, with a photo of their deceased son, Norman, who fell through the ice in 2007.

Elders say the ice should have been safe that day in 2007.

Norman had been on a hunting trip and was heading back into town in the early morning of late spring, when lower latitudes would still be shrouded in darkness but when this village sees nearly eternal sunshine, the tilt of the Earth making it possible to hunt through the night.

Village elders and family members tell me he was crossing a narrow part of the lagoon that separates Shishmaref and its barrier island from mainland Alaska. It may sound strange to drive a snowmobile across ice-covered water in June. But elders tell me the ice should have been frozen solid that time of year -- that there was no indication Norman would be in danger.

Now, everyone is less trusting.

Some haven't gone hunting on the ice since.

Norman's death was particularly hard on his father, Shelton, who keeps a photo of the young man, wearing a buzz cut and Reno-911 mustache, on his coffee table, facing the door for all to see. Norman was a second-chance child, one he taught to hunt seal and follow traditions Inupiat people had followed here for at least four centuries, if not many more. Yet, from birth, the boy had an air of tragedy about him, even if no one in the family dared say so aloud.

It was in the name: Norman.

Norman was named after Shelton's brother, who died in a plane crash.

The tragedy brought Shelton together with Clara, who was married to his brother.

In the wake of the accident, the two mourners decided to marry. Love was at the heart of it, to be sure, but Shelton also felt a sense of duty -- duty to occupy the loving, supportive station his brother had left vacant in Clara's life.

When one man leaves, another stands in his place.

'Like an old soul'

Esau Sinnok, 19, was adopted by his aunt, Bessi Sinnok.

The boy always seemed to possess knowledge from another life.

As a toddler, Esau Sinnok spouted off phrases in Inupiaq, the local language, even though no one had taught him to do so. Then, as a young boy, Esau was traveling with his birth mother across the empty landscape that surrounds Shishmaref. ""That's where I used to camp,"" he told her. It was the very spot where his namesake, Esau Weyiouanna, used to stay.

It was as if the renegade elder were speaking through the boy.

A voice carried on the wind from one generation to the next.

People in the village treat it this way.

For many, it's not just that young Esau reminds them of his namesake. It's that Esau is the namesake elder, returned from the grave and walking among them. They sometimes call him ""father"" or ""brother"" or ""cousin,"" referencing their relationships with the elder who passed away.

Esau inherited the elder's respected status, too. ""He's like an old soul,"" says his adoptive mother, Bessi Sinnok. ""He's very outspoken, like his namesake. His namesake was very respected by lots of people and because of that he had already earned respect as he was growing up.""

Teenage Esau never knew this when he was young. Bessi Sinnok told me the village hid the history from him. She wanted her son to form his own identity.

Yet she watched as the elder's personality seemed to emerge from the boy. Esau, who was nearly mute as a child, they say, bookish and reserved, grew to be an outspoken and free-thinking young man, much like the elder Esau -- and much to the surprise of his family.

Two events helped encourage the shift.

One was a storm in 2006.

Esau remembers the waves crashing over his grandparent's roof.

The small blue house at the edge of the land once seemed like it might stand forever.

After the storm, he tells me, ""We thought the house would collapse.""

The other was the death of his uncle, Norman, the man who feel through the ice.

Esau was only 9.

""It really hurts,"" Esau tells me. He's now a 19-year-old college student with heavy eyes and mussy hair. ""It really made me cry and wonder why he left so early. And there's not a day that goes by that I do not think of him. He's always on my mind. He's always in my heart.""

'Climate change is happening real fast'

Local meats, including seal, hang from drying racks in the village. Seal oil, made from blubber, is a staple.

A few years after Norman's death, Esau moved into Shelton and Clara Kokeok's blue house at the edge of the Earth. Esau tells me he wanted to help his grandparents with chores his uncle might have performed, which would have included things like getting ice for drinking water from the lake, washing clothes in the local ""Washateria"" and emptying the ""honey bucket"" toilet.

Shelton remembers telling his grandson how much the village had changed over the years, how the weather wasn't cold like it used to be, how these storms seemed bigger now, how much of the land, including the neighbor's house, had already disappeared -- and how he might be next.

""When I built this house, there was still more ground out there,"" Shelton says. ""We're right on the edge of the beach now ... Climate change is happening real fast.""

But none of this made sense to Esau -- not really -- until his senior year of high school.

That's when he took Ken Stenek's science class.

Stenek, an affable, big-smiling guy with a wiry beard and a kettlebell figure, told the students about the greenhouse effect -- how pollution, mostly from fossil fuels, hangs around in the atmosphere and acts like a blanket, heating the planet. They watched ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" the high-profile documentary featuring former Vice President Al Gore and a graph often called the ""hockey stick."" That now-famous chart shows that levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere haven't been this high in hundreds of thousands of years.

Esau learned that a consensus of climate scientists -- at least 97% -- agree humans are causing rapid warming, and that continuing to pollute at current rates would be catastrophic, contributing to mass extinction, searing droughts, deadlier heat waves and more.

They also talked about the consequences for Shishmaref.

The ""erosion"" everyone in town was discussing?

That was related to the melting sea ice, the thawing of permafrost, the frequency of damaging storms. In short: By burning fossil fuels, people were helping destroy this village.

If you'd asked him the year before what he wanted to do with his professional life, Esau would have told you he wanted to be a petroleum engineer, like his brother. Good money, he'd say, unaware that extracting and burning fossil fuels like oil is contributing to the problem.

Now, however, Esau was learning the science.

He thought about his grandfather's house.

His uncle's death.

He believes that climate change had a hand in both.

'Imminent' threats

This education took him all the way to Paris.

Through Ken Stenek's science class, Esau met researchers who were studying climate change and its consequences. And through those connections he became an Arctic Youth Ambassador, which is a program of two federal agencies and Alaska Geographic, a nonprofit. He learned that Shishmaref is not alone -- that 31 villages in Alaska face ""imminent"" threats from erosion and other issues related to climate change, according to a Government Accountability Office report; and that 12 of them were exploring relocation options because of warming.

Esau started to wonder: Could Shishmaref actually survive the melting of the Arctic?

Was his village's life nearing its end?

Or the start of a new beginning?

Those questions never occurred to Esau before, although they had been on the lips of older people in Shishmaref for years. They're questions kept from young people, hoping to protect them, wanting them to grow up with a sense that the world is more certain than it is.

The Obama White House named Esau a Champion of Change for Climate Equity. He got to go to Washington. Then, he said, with help from the Sierra Club, an environmental group, he got to attend international climate change negotiations in Paris in December 2015. It was that meeting -- which is often called ""COP21,"" since that's simpler than ""the 21st meeting of the conference of parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change"" -- where world leaders agreed, after decades of failure, to work together to end the fossil fuel era.

The target: Limit global temperature increases to no more than 2 degrees Celsius.

Basically, that means eliminating fossil fuels this century.

In Paris, hope filled the air -- hope for a cleaner, safer future.

Esau, meanwhile, arrived in the French capital terrified.

It was just so different from Shishmaref.

""It felt a little claustrophobic to me, being in a big city for the first time,"" he says. ""It felt like I just can't take a walk or go outside and walk without thinking of being threatened or beat up. When you walk around here, you don't feel that. Everyone here is family. You get a sense of trust."" He was so afraid of Paris -- its clustered buildings, sidewalks thick with people, streets clogged with smoking cars -- that he did not dare leave the hotel without an escort.

The scale of the place got to him in other ways, too.

How much pollution are all these people creating?

How do you get all of them to change?

In a word: overwhelming.

Yet amid this chaos, Esau made another leap of understanding.

'Before it completely erodes away'

Percy Nayokpuk owns one of two stores in town. ""Climate change is happening,"" he says.

Rae Bainteiti comes from Kiribati, a tropical island nation that could not be more geographically dissimilar from Shishmaref. Sun and sand vs. ice and snow. The two places are thousands of miles apart, separated by the vast Pacific Ocean and a half-world of latitude, with Shishmaref near the Arctic Circle and Kiribati near the equator. Yet when an interviewer sat Rae down with Esau in Paris, the two young men discussed the perils of a common threat.

Both may have to relocate because of climate change.

""My future generation of kids will be the last ones that will actually be on the island of Shishmaref before it completely erodes away,"" Esau tells Rae in the Paris interview, which is posted on YouTube.

He looks directly at the other young man.

""It's just really sad knowing that you probably have to relocate and migrate, too,"" Esau says.

""Your country has to be stopped from melting so we don't see water rising,"" Rae replies.

Experts say there are no programs -- in the United States or internationally -- designed specifically to plan and fund climate-driven relocations. Only a few moves have been funded with money designated for climate adaptation projects, said Elizabeth Ferris, research professor at Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of International Migration.

""Governments are reluctant to think about planned relocations because everyone wants to stay where they are,"" she told me. But ""if it isn't planned well, it just doesn't work. It leaves people much worse off.""

""There's no federal or state law -- no institution in the United States -- with a mandate for how are we going to manage relocation internally,"" said Alice Thomas, the climate displacement program manager at Refugees International, a non-profit group. ""It's going to be enormously expensive. It's going to be very vulnerable people ... people who aren't going to be able to cut their losses on their home when they can't get flood insurance. Where will they go?""

In Shishmaref, the answer remains unclear.

Relocation

Local officials in Shishmaref discuss the possibility of climate relocation. They do not have the money to move.

August 2016.

Globally, it tied for the hottest month of the hottest year on record. In Shishmaref, residents went to the polls to decide whether they would relocate because of warming.

The answer: Yes, by a margin of 89 to 78, according to local officials.

But the August 16 vote did not solve Shishmaref's trouble. Far from it.

Annie Weyiouanna, local coordinator for the Native Village of Shishmaref, tells me the tribe has no money to fund the move. And this isn't the first time the village has held a relocation vote. They did so in 2002, as well. Nothing changed. No one in the village today is packing. And Weyiouanna has tried to stop using the word ""relocation"" -- or uses it minimally, sometimes correcting herself -- because she worries it will signal to funding agencies in the state and federal governments that the village will be gone soon and doesn't need help with grants or infrastructure. The reality is that no one knows how long the village will be stuck.

Perhaps forever, some worry, or until the island is gone.

""They are not safe right now, and their lives are in danger because of the storms that are coming in,"" said Robin Bronen, executive director of the Alaska Institute for Justice and a senior research scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. She was referring to Shishmaref as well as Newtok and Kivalina, Alaska, which face similar circumstances. ""(T)hey just need a large sum of money to get them to the places that they've chosen so they can be safe.""

Shishmaref has identified two potential sites for a new version of the community. Both are inland, meaning hunters and fishers would not be able to access the sea as easily. Some people in the community -- particularly elders -- believe the move threatens the tribe's Inupiat identity.

Away from the coast, are they still the same people?

Why should they move when others are driving climate change?

Esau has wrestled with these questions, too. His grandparents, Shelton and Clara, the couple in the blue house at the edge of the Earth, who lost their son to the ice, do not want to leave. They want to stay in their home -- in the community they know so well -- no matter the risks.

Esau worries about them.

""If you ask the older generations like my grandfather, their views are totally different,"" he tells me. ""They want to stay on this island forever and ever. And I respect that decision. They're my elders.

""But, to me, I think we have to relocate so that our future generations can still be alive.""

Norman, age 7

In the winter, the skies in Shishmaref appear to be frozen in twilight.

On my last day in Shishmaref, Esau and I paid his old science teacher a visit.

We found Ken Stenek in a cream-colored house with Christmas lights on the roofline. He lives on a part of the island where houses are newer. Some were moved from the side where Esau's grandparents live, and where coastal erosion is more threatening.

Standing in his home, I couldn't help but think about the cemetery.

About the two men -- Esau and Norman -- who are buried there.

Two young people, bearing those names, were standing in the room with me.

There was Esau Sinnok, standing in the entryway, of course.

But also Norman, sitting on the sofa in the living room.

Norman Stenek, age 7.

The boy was named after Esau's uncle, the one who fell through the ice.

When I visited, young Norman seemed more interested in a tablet computer than a conversation with a random reporter, and I can't blame him for that. Still, the encounter sticks with me.

It made me wonder: What will his life be like?

His name -- Norman -- carries a tragic legacy. The death in the plane crash. The fall through the ice. Will this 7-year-old live to see the rest of the village drown beneath the waves, too?

Will the same happen to millions of coastal residents during his lifetime?

And what about Esau?

Sometimes I think the weight of this tragedy falls on his young shoulders. His namesake was a local agitator and his uncle's death drove him into activism. The strength of his voice -- his power to command attention -- has surprised a village where few care to stand out from the crowd. He speaks out against fossil fuels, saying that the world must rush to a future with 100% renewable, clean energy. It may be too late for Shishmaref, he says, but what about other communities in similar straits? How many people will pollution force from their homes?

""I don't blame it on one person, or a group of people. It's all our fault,"" Esau tells me. ""It's not the 1940s anymore. We can't use fossil fuels anymore to heat our homes and use for our energy.

""We can transition from dirty fossil fuels to renewable energies.""

But how much weight can a 19-year-old bear?

The rest of us must realize our role in this tragedy.

Responsibility for Shishmaref's plight falls on those in the industrialized world who continue to pollute the atmosphere with carbon, knowing it will warm the climate, melt the ice and make it less likely Shishmaref will survive. It falls on the Trump administration, which has moved to defund and upend climate change initiatives instead of planning for a transition to cleaner power sources, like wind and solar. It falls on politicians who know the scope of the impending climate relocation crisis but have done little to make adequate plans or secure appropriate funding.

Shishmaref is part of America, even if it's rarely treated that way.

It is a place where people never really die, where the cemetery on that hilltop in the center of the island is full of people like Norman and Esau who are kept alive by names and stories. The question now is whether villages, like people, can be reincarnated.

Can Shishmaref be reborn?

Sadly, it's a question the village cannot answer on its own.","Wed, 29 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170327163201-shishmaref-video-01-super-tease.jpg,"['shishmaref', 'tells', 'esau', 'young', 'man', 'climate', 'elder', 'house', 'built', 'village', 'tragedy', 'ice']",

It is believed many are remaining in flooded rooms - some even without windows after the storm struck Queensland's tropical north.

Tensions have flared as people flock to the Airlie Beach Woolworths supermarket where a mobile phone charging station has been set up.

There are reports of a shouting match between tourists this morning when a woman was told: “You’ve had long enough, let someone else have a turn.”

People in the Bowen and Airlie Beach areas have been warned against drinking tap water, as it may have become contaminated.

Emergency alerts have been issued by the Whitsunday Regional Council to advise people to boil drinking water, as restored water may be discoloured and contain bacteria.

If they have no other option, tap water should be boiled for three minutes, cooled and stored in a clean container with a lid, the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services advised.

Drinking water is available from 8am tomorrow from the Whitsunday Plaza carpark (formerly Centro). Residents should take their own container to collect water, as no bottled water will be given out.

As the clean up continues in northern Queensland, the first guests have been evacuated from the Whitsunday islands resorts, which was hard hit by Debbie.

Thousands remain stranded on Hamilton Island on Friday ahead of planned airlifts to Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne in the coming days.

Story continues

HMAS Melville has assisted with the successful evacuation of more than 400 people from Daydream Island following the cyclone, the Royal Australian Navy reported.

Energex has reported about 60,000 Queensland homes, from the Sunshine Coast down to the Gold Coast are still without electricity.

Many homes will remain without power for a ""number of days"".

The power provider says the full extent of the damage to the network is still unknown with flooding and debris blocking roads.

""As a result of these issues, there will be customers across these regions who will be without power for a number of days,"" Energex Event Manager Jeff Philipson said.

With major flooding expected on the Albert and Logan Rivers the situation could become even worse.

Major flooding is occurring along the Tweed River at Murwillumbah, where early Friday morning the river level peaked slightly higher than the 1954 flood.

A woman's body has been found on a flooded property about 20 kilometres south of the town.

The Tweed River peaked at an estimated 6.20m around 04.30 Friday morning, with major flooding, and is falling slowly.

The main peak in the Tweed River is nearing Chinderah (Barneys Point) where river levels are peaking with this afternoon's high tide, the Bureau of Meteorology, reported.

The river is expected to rise again and possibly reach 2.50m early Saturday morning with the high tide.

Hinze Dam, on the Gold Coast is now at its highest level ever recorded, and the Logan River has exceeded its recorded flood level of 1991, Bureau said.

Calls to ""get to higher ground"" for areas in Gold Coast and Logan have been issued following warnings people may have perished in Lismore as floodwaters swept through northern NSW.

More than 300 Logan properties are likely to be impacted, including up to 211 inundated across a large low area.

Police are door knocking the area after Commissioner Ian Stewart announced fresh evacuation orders for parts of Logan City, south of Brisbane, as well as areas in north of the Gold Coast.

Cyclone Debbie's tail batters Southeast Queensland

The trail of destruction caused by the tail of Cyclone Debbie will become clearer after heavy rains and flash floods in Queensland's southeast.

Category four winds and associated rain that blasted the northern coastline have turned towards the inland and the south of the state where almost almost 500mm fell in 24 hours near the Gold Coast.

Brisbane and surrounding areas copped, 226 millimetres, more than twice a month's worth of March rainfall on Thursday.

While Queensland’s major banana growing regions were relatively unscathed by the cyclone, a Category Four storm when it hit onshore with winds around 260km per hour, vegetable growers in the region were hit hard just as they were planting winter crops.

Horticulture is Queensland’s second largest primary industry, valued at more than A$2.8bn each year, and the major producer of the country’s winter supply of tomatoes and capsicums.

Cherry Emerick of Bowen Gumlu Growers Association, the representative body for Australia's largest winter vegetable growing region, told Produce Plus that they were still in the process of compiling information on the extent of the crop damage.

“There are definitely some plantings that are gone or completely destroyed. We’re still trying to contact growers at the moment,” Emerick said. “We’re still assessing the damage and it will probably change daily.

“The next step will be getting out to the farms to see where growers need help, whether it's with machinery, labour or financial assistance.”

Emerick said the wild weather of last night had subsided, with the sun coming out and growers hoping for a dry night ahead. The town of Bowen is still without water supply and with power lines down around the region, many homes are still without electricity.

Queensland Farmers’ Federation president Stuart Armitage said while the initial impact of the Category 4 storm had passed, rains and winds were still a threat to growers in South East Queensland.

“Although it is early days, the region is worth over A$1bn to Queensland’s agricultural production value so it would be fair to assume that the damage will be at least hundreds of millions of dollars,” said Armitage. “Contact with farmers continues to be difficult as many properties remain isolated by flood waters and communication channels via landline or mobile phone are inconsistent.

“As the system moves inland and southward the expected high rainfall will most likely result in flooding in regions that were not initially impacted by the cyclone.”

Widespread daily rainfall totals of 150-250mm, with isolated falls of 500mm, were expected to lead to major river flooding over a broad area next week.

Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said during an 8pm update the Bureau of Meteorology had categorised the cyclone a category 4 in intensity.

""The residents of Bowen at this stage would feel a big impact from this cyclone,"" she said earlier in the day.

""I would rather take these precautionary measures now than have people's lives put at risk.""

CYCLONE MEMORIES

Steve Siltanen, who lived through Cyclone Larry in Innisfail, was bunkered down in the Ayr Cyclone Shelter, dreading what would become of his low-set, old, beachside home.

During Larry's ferocious power, a tree blew through his window, and a gas bottle into his hallway even though neither he nor his neighbours had gas.

""It was scary. The noise, just like jet engines,"" he said.

""... the power of the wind was so bad, once the roof come off, everything was flying past.""

The 52-year-old Alva Beach resident, his partner and child, were praying they would avoid a repeat, as the cyclone turned further south, away from Ayr.

Danella Noah was almost as concerned about the old house in the Rita Island evacuation zone where her grandmother had lived since she was a teenager.

""I'm pretty scared,"" she said.

""I don't know what will happen and what will Ayr look like after it.""

MILITARY RESOURCES READY

Australian Defence Force Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said Defence was well-positioned to provide immediate assistance to communities within the storm zone, in co-ordination with state and local disaster management authorities, if requested.

As a precaution, HMAS Choules left Sydney on Monday for Queensland, with two Navy MRH90 helicopters deployed to Oakey.

Air Force aircraft in Townsville, Amberley and Darwin were also on standby to deliver essential supplies and equipment.

More than 800 energy workers were on standby to help restore power when flood waters receded and the debris was cleared, with crews deployed from the Ipswich area on Monday.

Experts said the biggest threat from cyclones, such as Debbie, was typically huge storm surges that could inundate low-lying coastal regions, rather than the winds.

""More people have historically died from storm surges than the wind damage,"" Jonathan Nott, a specialist in extreme weather at James Cook University.

""[Yasi] literally swept houses ... off their foundations and they were totally gone,"" Professor Nott said. ""Others were destroyed.""

The cyclone was expected to make landfall close to the 9.45am (12.45pm NZ Time) high tide timing at Bowen, according to the weather bureau, which could intensify the storm's impact.

Taxi drivers in Townsville, Mackay, the Whitsundays, Burdekin and Ayr offered to evacuate residents for free.

Police door-knocking Cungulla and Cape Cleveland, about 40 minutes south of Townsville, were telling residents to leave but not forcing them out.

They suggested fewer than one in five residents had elected to stay.

Townsville Mayor Jenny Hill said authorities could not force people to leave.

""If people choose to remain in harm's way and something happens, don't expect us to come and get you,"" she said.

Bowen residents were bracing themselves for what they said would be the worst cyclone to hit the town since the 1950s, with thousands of people told to evacuate.

Bowen has a population of about 10,000 but space for only 800 in its cyclone shelter, prompting a warning for residents in flood-prone areas to leave the region before Cyclone Debbie crossed the coast.

Whitsunday Regional Council Mayor Andrew Willcox said people who could not leave should stay with friends or family in ""high, dry places"".

More than 100 schools were closed along the coast and shopfronts were being boarded up and filled with sandbags.

Mackay and Townsville airports have been closed.

In Bowen, Graham Wilson spray painted his white picket fence with a message for Cyclone Debbie: ""Cyclone Debbie bring it on Bowen is not a pussy town do your best you got"".

Wilson said he painted the sign to lift people's spirits.

""It's basically to put a smile on people's faces. Bowen's a lot bigger than Cyclone Debbie, so give us what you've got,"" he said.

But Wilson, who has lived in Bowen for 40 years, said he did not want to sound unconcerned as the town would likely sustain serious damage.

""We have not had a cyclone like this since '58,"" he said.

Stefan Seyffer and Vincent White helped other residents fill sandbags and said many people living in evacuation zones were choosing to stay because of their pets.

""We've got an elderly lady living next door so we'll stay to help,"" Seyffer said.

YouTube user Aussie Mechand Tech Junkies has been livestreaming Debbie from his Midge Point residence.

He began streaming at 4pm and will continue until the storm is over or the power cuts out. Currently, his live video shows torrential rain hitting Midge Point, north of Mackay.

FLOOD RISKS

Cyclone Yasi, which struck north Queensland in 2011, powered a storm surge that reached 7.5 metres between Cardwell and Tully Heads, akin to a tsunami, said David King, the director of the Centre for Disaster Studies at James Cook University in Townsville.

Storm surges ""bring in flooding"", Professor King said. ""The water moves in at a great speed.""

The deep low pressure at the eye of a cyclone raises ocean levels. The strong winds also whip up waves that ride on the top, with the impact intensified if the storm's arrival coincides with a high tide.

On current forecasts, the storm is predicted to make landfall at 9 am local time, or close to the 9.45 am high tide timing at Bowen, according to the bureau.

""More people have historically died from storm surges than the wind damage,"" Jonathan Nott, a specialist in extreme weather also at James Cook University (JCU), said, noting the Great Bhola Cyclone killed half a million people in Bangladesh in 1970.

""[Yasi] literally swept houses ... off their foundations and they were totally gone,"" Professor Nott said. ""Others were destroyed.""

""We could be looking at 3-4 metres with Debbie as it intensifies,"" he said. At this point, it may cross the coast around mid-tide, although the timing could change if the storm's track quickens or slows by just a couple of kilometres per hour.

Jeff Kepert, head of severe weather research at the bureau, said it's long been understood that flooding poses a greater risk for people living in a cyclone's path.

""You hide from the wind but you flee from the water,"" Dr Kepert said, citing a long-standing view.

Shifts in the forecast track of just 30 kilometres can add a metre in storm-surge height if the storm hits a bay rather than a headland.

While the science of cyclones has advanced rapidly in recent decades, more improvements will be introduced by the end of 2017, Dr Kepert said. These changes, such as better modelling, will allow forecasters to give better ""worst-case"" predictions for coastal inundation and the strength of cyclones.

""Intensity forecasts have scarcely improved at all,"" compared with other recent advances, he said.

RAIN, REEF

Heavy rainfall, perhaps as much as 400 millimetres, could also lead to inundation particularly if it combines with swollen rivers and high tides.

""Townsville had a very poor wet season,"" so the catchment is really dry ahead of Cyclone Debbie, Professor King said.

Both professors said cyclones such as Debbie were important for bringing rainfall to inland parts of Queensland and also for helping to ease the threat of bleaching and death of coral reefs.

Much of the corals of the central Great Barrier Reef appear to be bleaching this year, adding to the damage from last year's massive bleaching event.

CLIMATE SIGNAL

Research in recent years indicates that climate change reducing the numbers of cyclones forming off Queensland but they are becoming stronger when they do form.

Tropical cyclones leave an historical mark on the landscape in part because of that storm surge. Unlike the extra-tropical east coast low that hit Sydney last year and caused large-scale beach erosion at places such as Collaroy, tropical tempests tend to dump large amounts of sand inland, Professor Nott said.

JCU researchers are going to be in the field collecting data on the wind speed and strength of the storm surge but also the chemistry of the rain dumped on the region.

Interestingly, rain and water vapour from cyclones has a distinct isotopic signature, with most of the oxygen-18 isotopes rained out because of the intense convection of the event and how high the molecules rise within the storm.

Using the chemical record within limestone another other sources, Professor Nott and other scientists have been able to show that cyclones are now the fewest in at least. 800 years for the Cairns region and 1500 years for Western Australia.

""We've already been able to show that climate change is already affecting the behaviour of tropical cyclones in Australia,"" Professor Nott said.

""One of major impacts is a very marked increase in the intensity and a marked decrease in the frequency [of cyclones],"" he said. ""This really started occurring quite dramatically in 1970.

Most other regions of the world can expect both more cyclones and stronger ones, so on that score Queensland at least be luckier than some.

However, given the positive impacts from cyclones, having fewer such storms may not be such a good thing.

""It doesn't sound very good for coral reefs and it doesn't sound very good for rain-penetrating systems getting into the interior of Queensland,"" Professor Nott said.

RECORD HEAT

While meteorologists are focused on Cyclone Debbie, a slew of heat records are being set across inland Australia

On Sunday, three states set late-season records for maximum temperatures and more may be set before the heatwave ebbs.

Ceduna reached 44.6 degrees, the hottest for this late in the year for South Australia.

In NSW, Tibooburra closed 41.6 degrees, while Birdsville in Queensland touched 43 degrees.

Wilcannia on Monday broke the record again, with 44 degrees as of 3.50 pm. Birdsville also beat Sunday's mark with 43.3 degrees reached so far.

""We've had very hot conditions in central Australia for about a week now,"" Blair Trewin, senior bureau climatologist, said, noting that Alice Springs had days above 38 degrees since last Monday and about three weeks above 35 degees.

Birdsville topped 40 degrees on Monday for a seventh day in a row, matching the record for March, with another two days forecast.

Dr Trewin said there was unlikely to be a direct connection between the record warmth and cyclone Debbie, although regions to the north of the storm will likely see unusually warm weather as westerlies drag in inland heat.

Cairns, for instance, had 33.6 degrees on Sunday, or three degrees above the March average.","Tue, 28 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/i/4/g/v/a/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1i4gvv.png/1490634287622.png,"['degrees', 'cyclone', 'cyclones', 'biggest', 'bowen', 'storm', 'queensland', 'come', 'threat', 'residents', 'professor', 'nott', 'tide', 'debbie']",

On March 18, 2017, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the world’s twenty leading economies—the G20—issued a communiqué highlighting that

The malicious use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) could disrupt financial services crucial to both national and international financial systems, undermine security and confidence and endanger financial stability. We will promote the resilience of financial services and institutions in G20 jurisdictions against the malicious use of ICT, including from countries outside the G20. With the aim of enhancing our cross-border cooperation, we ask the FSB [Financial Stability Board], as a first step, to perform a stock-taking of existing relevant released regulations and supervisory practices in our jurisdictions, as well as of existing international guidance, including to identify effective practices. The FSB should inform about the progress of this work by the Leaders Summit in July 2017 and deliver a stock-take report by October 2017.1

The G20 finance ministers and central bank governors should be commended for urging improvements in the resilience of the global financial system. But governments should not only ask the private sector to do more; governments themselves can help reduce the risk to the financial sector. The G20 heads of state could commit their countries explicitly to refrain from using offensive cybertools to corrupt the integrity of data in the financial system and to cooperate when such attacks do occur.

Tim Maurer Dr. Tim Maurer was director of the Cyber Policy Initiative and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. More > @maurertim

The financial crisis that erupted in 2007 highlighted how important trust is for the global system and how fragile it can be. The 2016 Bangladesh central bank cyber incident exposed a new threat to financial stability and the unprecedented scale of the risk that malicious cyber actors pose to financial institutions.2 Beyond theft, using cyber operations to manipulate the integrity of data, in particular, poses a distinct and greater set of systemic risks than other forms of financial coercion. The complex and interdependent character of the financial system and its transcendence of physical and national boundaries mean that manipulating the integrity of financial institutions’ data can, intentionally and/or unintentionally, threaten financial stability and the stability of the international system. Importantly, unlike the 2007–2008 global crisis, this risk exists independent of the underlying economic fundamentals and will only increase as more and more governments make cashless economies an explicit goal.3

In 2015, the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UNGGE) and the G20 had already suggested broad norms against attacks on critical civilian infrastructure in peacetime. The G20 finance ministers and central bank governors have now highlighted particularly the risk to financial stability. In this text, we therefore propose that states build on these existing agreements and go further, explicitly committing not to undermine the integrity of data and algorithms of financial institutions in peacetime or during war,4 nor to allow their nationals to do so.5

We propose the following language for such an agreement, of course inviting debate and refinement:

A State must not conduct or knowingly support any activity that intentionally manipulates the integrity of financial institutions’ data and algorithms wherever they are stored or when in transit.



To the extent permitted by law, a State must respond promptly to appropriate requests by another State to mitigate activities manipulating the integrity of financial institutions’ data and algorithms when such activities are passing through or emanating from its territory or perpetrated by its citizens.

States have already demonstrated significant restraint from using cyber means against the integrity of financial institutions’ data. Such an agreement would therefore be making explicit what could be considered emerging state practice. Making it explicit would

send a clear signal that the stability of the global financial system depends on preserving the integrity of financial data in peacetime and during war and that the international community considers the latter off limits;

build confidence among states that already practice restraint in this domain, and thereby increase their leverage to mobilize the international community in case the norm is violated;

create political momentum for greater collaboration to tackle nonstate actors who target financial institutions with cyber-enabled means; and

complement and enhance existing agreements and efforts, namely the 2015 G20 statement, the 2015 UNGGE report, and the 2016 cyber guidance from the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (CPMI-IOSCO).

While the March 18 G20 finance ministers and central bank governors communiqué does not define “malicious use of ICT,” it is reasonable to think that it particularly focuses on the integrity and availability of financial data. For, it is inevitable and not necessarily malicious that law enforcement and intelligence agencies will breach the confidentiality of data in banks and other financial institutions in order to counter terrorism, weapons proliferation, and criminality. This paper therefore describes why it is vital to the stability of the international system to prohibit the corruption of data in the global financial system, and to strengthen a comprehensive norm to this effect.

Ariel (Eli) Levite Levite was the principal deputy director general for policy at the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission from 2002 to 2007.

States would be expected to fulfill these commitments in accordance with the limits and requirements of national and international laws, both of which may ultimately need to be adjusted to reflect the commitments suggested here. They would also be expected to implement

existing guidance and best practices, such as those outlined in the 2016 CPMI-IOSCO cyber guidance.6

There is now an opportunity for the G20 heads of state to promulgate such a commitment and to ask the Financial Stability Board to implement it in detail, together with the relevant standard-setting bodies, the private sector, law enforcement, and Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) communities. It would build on the precedent set in 2015 when the G20 decided to include cybersecurity in its head of state communiqué and the precedent with the actions taken by the G20 after the 2007 financial crisis as well as the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors communiqué.

Background

In 2015, the UNGGE, which included representatives from the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, agreed in their consensus report that: “A State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public.”7

This declaration was later endorsed by heads of state at the 2015 G20 summit.8 Such general political commitments are laudable. Yet, history suggests that states often overpromise and underdeliver in upholding such broad normative declarations. One problem is ambiguity: states may differ in how they define critical infrastructure. There is also a growing number of experts expressing skepticism that the UNGGE process will be effective.9 Moreover, the language developed by the UNGGE focuses on the effects of cyber operations leaving a gap in the specific context of the highly interdependent global financial system. There is value, then, in seeking a more detailed agreement building on and clarifying this language in the context of specific operations that could be especially damaging to the international system.

George Perkovich Perkovich works primarily on nuclear strategy and nonproliferation issues; cyberconflict; and new approaches to international public-private management of strategic technologies. More >

The financial system is a particularly promising area given existing common interests among most states. It differs from most other types of critical infrastructure, such as transportation or the electrical grid, because it is globally interdependent. Major powers, notwithstanding their fundamental differences, have recognized this in principle and deed. The U.S. government reportedly refrained from using offensive cyber operations against Saddam Hussein’s financial systems as well as in hypothetical exercises simulating a conflict with China. 10 Russia’s 2011 Draft Convention on International Information Security explicitly suggests that “each State Party will take the measures necessary to ensure that the activity of international information systems for the management of the flow of . . . finance . . . continues without interference.” 11 China also has a vested interest in the system, reflected, among other ways, by its successful effort to make the renminbi part of the IMF’s global reserve currency basket. 12 Meanwhile, countries around the world are setting up or strengthening their CERTs specific to the financial sector, as, for example, India did in February 2017. 13

Global interdependence makes the financial sector at once more vulnerable than other critical infrastructure and more likely to be in the common interest of states to protect. The damaging effects of an intrusion targeting the electrical grid or the oil and gas sector will be mostly limited to a single country’s territory or immediate neighbors. The effects of an incident targeting the data integrity of a financial institution, however, are not necessarily bound by geography. Such effects would be very difficult to understand, and therefore hard to tailor and to predict. An operation targeting a payment processing system could directly corrupt the transactions running through it. Indirectly, a manipulation of the integrity of an institution’s data could lead to a bankruptcy that in turn could send shock waves throughout the international system. For example, the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers highlighted the unanticipated contagion effect the bankruptcy of even a single institution can have. The 1997 Asian financial crisis was similarly triggered by the collapse of the Thai currency and the unanticipated contagion effect across the region. Such second-order effects are difficult to anticipate. Moreover, they may not be factored in the attacker’s battle damage assessments.

International experience in outlawing counterfeiting currencies may be instructive here. States have adhered to and helped enforce the prohibition against counterfeiting because there is widespread mutual vulnerability to its effects. And because this restraint is widely accepted, states violating it are highly likely to face punishment. Nonstate actors, of course, persist in counterfeiting, as do North Korea and a few other states, but the practice is contained enough that it does not threaten the stability of the international financial system. 14

Another historical analogy conveys why major economic powers such as the G20, at least, would have interests in endorsing and upholding a specific norm against manipulating financial data in peacetime and in wartime: in 1914, the British government, using its dominant position in the global trade and financial system, conducted economic warfare against Germany. The strategy succeeded at deranging the global economy but after only three months, the British government abandoned it. The backlash occurred far more intensely and faster than anticipated, including protests from UK businesses, laborers, and political figures and pressure from allies. 15 The then-highly integrated nature of the global economy made it impossible to contain the blowback from an economic attack.



Of course, in the twenty-first century, a few states that are relatively detached from the global economy, and nonstate actors who may or may not be affiliated with them, have capabilities to conduct cyberattacks against financial institutions. Such hostile actors would not be expected to adhere to the proposed commitment. Yet, the states that did endorse such a norm explicitly would be more united and would have a clearer interest and basis for demanding and conducting retaliatory action against violators of the norm, be they states, terrorists, or cybercriminals. In other words, the proposed explicit agreement could be a foundation on which to develop collective action against violators of any kind. (Some states that declared adherence could be tempted to tolerate or utilize “privateers” or other proxies to attack financial institutions. But, here, too, the existence of the agreement would provide more leverage than exists today to pressure mal-intentioned states).

Building on Existing Norms and International Law

An explicit agreement against manipulating the integrity of financial institutions’ data would build on recent international efforts to develop rules for cyberspace and on foundational international law against counterfeiting currency. Such a commitment also would redress a lacuna in the Law of Armed Conflict (also known as international humanitarian law).

To date, the international community’s most important effort to develop rules of the road for cyberspace is the UN Group of Governmental Experts process, whose work was endorsed by the G20 in 2015.

Yet, first, the group’s 2015 declaration and its G20 endorsement, thus far, lack detail and concrete steps to turn them into effective and robust security regimes. Second, the UNGGE aspirational norms language applies to peacetime and does not address wartime behavior or the gaps in existing international humanitarian law. It also faces a gap in the specific context of cyber operations targeting financial institutions.

In many ways, manipulating the integrity of financial data is analogous to counterfeiting currency. Here, the 1929 International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currencymay provide a legal base on which to build. 16 As then general counsel of the International Monetary Fund, François Gianviti, summarized in 2004, “A state’s right to issue its currency is protected against foreign states. Therefore, a foreign state may not counterfeit another state’s currency (customary international law and Geneva Convention of April 20, 1929 for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency).” 17 Violations of this prohibition have been rare, demonstrating that the norm has been particularly robust over a period stretching several decades. 18 This reflects states’ shared recognition that counterfeiting currency undermines the integrity and trust of the overall financial system on which most, if not all, depend.

However, states have not yet debated and decided whether and how the injunction against counterfeiting could and should be extended to the digital age. That is, can and should the Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency be applied to digital currency and/or financial data? If the integrity of financial data in the twenty-first century is as important to maintain as the integrity of currency, then making this explicit through a specific new agreement would serve global interests. The precedent of the anti-counterfeiting regime could foster understanding of this interest and confidence that an injunction against manipulating financial data could be feasible.

The Law of Armed Conflict also currently falls short of accounting for the nature and importance of data. There are at least two large issues here. One relates to jus ad bellum (the just cause for war). Legal experts are divided over whether an attack on financial data (however portentous and massive its potential effects) qualifies as a use of force. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter only prohibits the use of armed force, not political or economic coercion. 19 More broadly, with the emergence of hybrid warfare and information warfare, the international community is now wrestling with whether and how to legally treat acts of coercion that fall short of the use of force. The 2017 Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations focuses on this issue.



More pertinent is whether jus in bello (the just conduct of war) requires or allows data to be judged off-limits from targeting. Legal experts again are divided here. For example, the group of legal experts that compiled the 2013 Tallinn Manual argued that data do not constitute an object and that therefore offensive cyber operations targeting the integrity of financial data are beyond the scope, principles, and protections of existing international humanitarian law. 20 Consequently, the status of financial data under international law is a subject of debate.

Moreover, whether financial institutions are considered civilian or military objects depends on whether a country defines “military object” narrowly to only include war-fighting capabilities or, as the United States does, broadly to include “war-fighting and war-sustaining” capabilities. 21 In the latter case, financial institutions and their data could be seen as legitimate military targets in wartime (though, as noted earlier, the United States appears to have eschewed such attacks to date). 22

Thus, an explicit agreement not to manipulate the integrity of financial data could indicate, at least in this narrow domain, how subscribing states intend international law to evolve.

The Proposed Agreement

Current trends in international affairs suggest that cyber threats against infrastructure are most likely to occur in the gray zone between peace and armed conflict. 23 An agreement that only protects the integrity of financial data in peacetime would be insufficient, given how vital the financial system is to the stability and well-being of all states and societies. The potential unintended negative consequences of an attack on the integrity of data, including blowback, weigh heavily against any benefit. Moreover, in case of armed conflict, money will be needed to rebuild and to pay any potential reparations. It is therefore desirable and feasible for states to agree not to manipulate the integrity of financial data in any circumstances.

Focusing on the integrity of data does not devalue the importance of protecting its availability and confidentiality. However, it can be argued that the national and international consequences of manipulating data are greater than violations of confidentiality and more difficult to address technically than the interruption of availability. Corruption of data integrity can pose significant challenges for recovery. In addition to technical challenges, certain legal provisions specific to the financial system pose further hurdles, such as settlement finality. For these and other reasons, the manipulation of the integrity of data is a significantly bigger problem than malicious activity undermining the availability of data. Last but not least, while experts might disagree what constitutes “systemic risk” for the financial system, there is widespread consensus that the integrity of data is the most worrisome risk that exists.

Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are relatively common. Technical solutions to prevent and mitigate them are available, and they are temporary and reversible. Moreover, states and the international community (through the United Nations) occasionally impose sanctions on financial institutions, which is somewhat akin to denying availability of the resources in these institutions to their owners and users. Proscriptions of operations that affect the availability of data could be included when the intention and/or effect is to corrupt the integrity of transactions, as in outsider trading, for example. The same applies to the availability of data on certain critical systems. Defining whether and how manipulations of the availability of such data could be addressed and included in the proposed agreement requires broader expert consultation and advice. The G20 should task the Financial Stability Board to work with relevant standard-setting bodies and experts to report on this issue for further consideration.

Regarding confidentiality, some states will continue to conduct cyber operations to gather intelligence from banks and financial institutions. In addition to regulation, such operations are vital to tracking weapons proliferation and countering terrorism, money laundering, drug trafficking, and other illegal activities. Such espionage is not prohibited by international custom and law. 24 Seeking to proscribe intelligence gathering within a norm against cyber operations targeting financial institutions would make its adoption infeasible and/or raise significant doubts about its effectiveness once in place.

Of course, cyber-intelligence intrusions have motivated other countries to discuss establishing limitations. And technical issues must be addressed to determine whether it could be feasible to distinguish between cyber intrusions of financial systems for intelligence gathering, on one hand, and intrusions designed to enable manipulation of data, on the other hand. The covert installation of payloads capable of affecting the integrity of the financial data would be prohibited.

Taking these considerations into account, the proposed agreement as previously described would have three connected and mutually reinforcing elements:

A State must not conduct or knowingly support any activity that intentionally manipulates the integrity of financial institutions’ data and algorithms wherever they are stored or when in transit. 25



To the extent permitted by law, a State must respond promptly to appropriate requests by another State to mitigate activities manipulating the integrity of financial institutions’ data and algorithms when such activities are passing through or emanating from its territory or perpetrated by its citizens.

These provisions also build on the 2015 UNGGE report’s declaration: “States must not use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts using ICTs, and should seek to ensure that their territory is not used by non-State actors to commit such acts.” 26

The important characteristic of this proposal is that it combines a negative norm, that is, states commit not to do something, as well as a positive norm, that is, states commit to do something. States would also be expected to implement existing due diligence standards and best practices, such as those outlined in the 2016 CPMI-IOSCO cyber guidance. Linking these three elements would augment the effectiveness of this normative regime overall, as illustrated in figure 1. Linking the agreement governing state behavior with expectations for the private sector to implement due diligence standards addresses potential moral hazard problems. The commitment by states to provide assistance and information, upon request, circumvents the attribution problem by shifting the burden from the victim of attack to states that profess interest in helping to respond to and ultimately prevent such attacks. States would be expected to comply with these obligations in accordance with the limits and requirements of national and international laws, both of which may ultimately need to be adjusted to reflect the norms described here.

In order to achieve effective reciprocal adherence and be widely accepted among UN member states, the agreement should not be limited to a subset of financial institutions, for example, the Global Systemically Important Banks (as enumerated by the Financial Stability Board) located in a dozen countries. From the standpoint of international stability—and of winning the support of a large number of states—it is worth considering whether protections should be extended to all states’ financial institutions. The idea is that cyber operations that threaten the integrity of any financial institution would create precedents and sow fears that could threaten all states.

The envisioned prohibition would be conveyed from states to states. It would not extend to nonstate actors (such as terrorists) operating on territory that the nominal sovereign is unable to police. While a wider scope would be desirable in many ways, practical considerations argue for narrowness. Persuading states to agree will be difficult enough initially, without involving nonstate actors. If and when key states subscribe to something like the agreement proposed here, future work could seek to broaden it in terms of actors and sanctuaried targets.

Process: Possible Next Steps for Anchoring the Norm

If the proposed agreement is desirable from the standpoint of national and global interests of key states, the question arises where to anchor it, how best to refine the details of its implementation, and where to seek adherents. The G20 has emerged as the most promising forum in which states could address the issues discussed here. One or more such states could champion the idea and invite others to improve upon and support it. Beyond that, the proposal could be raised for consideration in several international forums and multilateral organizations.

If the G20 were to find the proposed agreement compelling, it could:

Include the language proposed here (or otherwise improved) in the communiqué of the G20 heads of state meeting

Task the Financial Stability Board to implement and promulgate the agreement with the relevant standard-setting bodies and private sector institutions including CPMI, IOSCO, and the Basel Committee (this would include exploring some of the questions listed below, namely whether the availability of certain data and systems ought to be included and whether all types of data or specific types of data would fall under the agreement, such as transaction-based data, operations data, and ledger/ownership data); and develop a report to be submitted to the next G20 meeting outlining the progress made and a road map for further implementation.



Unlike the actions taken after the 2007–2008 financial crisis, adoption and implementation of an agreement like the one proposed here would require engagement with countries’ national security communities and CERTs. No international forum to date exists that allows for such interactions. However, the Financial Stability Board can act as the convener for such a process, potentially working with and supported by other nongovernmental organizations.

The Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the International Organization of Securities Commissions are relevant institutions, especially considering their recent work. The International Monetary Fund is another relevant institution as it is one of the few fora convening both representatives from ministries of finance and from central banks, two important stakeholder groups relevant to this proposal. The World Economic Forum’s interest and past engagement with cybersecurity presents an opportunity to raise attention about this issue among top executives from the private sector. These executives would need to be engaged to properly address technical details to enhance the verifiability and robustness of the norm. The Institute of International Finance is another institution that could engage with the global financial industry on these issues.

Finally, there are clearly limits to the extent to which officials in the national security communities of each country can engage with foreign governments and experts in the financial sector. Given that, we can envision a scenario where an international agreement through the G20 would be complemented by a series of unilateral declarations by each government or its military to bolster the G20’s statement and contributing to the agreement’s effectiveness. Unilateral declarations would also be an easy way for states that are not part of the G20 to express that they join the G20 member states in their commitment.

Questions to Be Addressed

We have developed this proposal with feedback from officials in government, relevant international organizations, and financial institutions in a select number of states, including the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Israel, to assess its propositions. The feedback has been generally positive; the foundational assumptions outlined in this memo were confirmed or adjusted in subsequent iterations. In order for the norm to be widely accepted and practiced, the following questions would need to be clarified and more fully addressed in its negotiation and implementation. We invite readers to consider them and offer responses to the authors and/or to other interested parties.

What should be the scope of financial institutions? Are the definitions and scope listed below sufficient, or would they need to be narrowed or broadened? 27 The following terminology lists already agreed-upon definitions in international trade, especially the final definitions negotiated as part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and the international finance community: “any financial intermediary or other enterprise that is authorised to do business and regulated or supervised as a financial institution under the law of the Party in whose territory it is located” (this is the definition of a “financial institution” in the TPP’s final text for financial services);

“a financial institution, including a branch, located in the territory of a Party that is controlled by persons of another Party” (this is the definition of a “financial institution of another party” in the TPP’s final text for financial services);

“any non-governmental body, including any securities or futures exchange or market, clearing agency, or other organisation or association, that exercises regulatory or supervisory authority over financial service suppliers or financial institutions by statute or delegation from central or regional government” (this is the definition of a “self-regulatory organisation” in the TPP’s final text for financial services); 28 and

and “a multilateral system among participating institutions, including the operator of the system, used for the purposes of clearing, settling, or recording payments, securities, derivatives, or other financial transactions” (this is the definition of “financial market infrastructure” in BIS/IOSCO 2012 Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures). 29 Given the potential significant effect for the system at large if certain data and systems are unavailable, how can availability be added and combined with the focus on the integrity of data in a meaningful framing and description? Also, is there malicious activity targeting availability that affects the integrity of transactions, and, if so, how should this be addressed? In the context of an armed conflict and international humanitarian war, can a distinction be made between targeting financial institutions in their physical form versus targeting their data? In other words, if it is permissible to target a bank with conventional means to destroy currency it physically stores, should it not be permissible to target a bank with cyber means because of the latter’s potential collateral damage and blowback potential through offensive cyber operations, in particular? With financial institutions taking advantage of cloud services to outsource part of their data management to other companies, is the proposed language “wherever they are stored” an effective way to capture this trend? Is it necessary? Would the agreement apply only to those states that agree to accept it, or would those that accept the norm be expected to apply its requirements and limitations vis-à-vis states that did not make a reciprocal commitment? More broadly, in the case of any norm that forswears a very specific activity, how do states avoid seeming to signal tolerance of other activities that may also be harmful? Or conversely, isn’t a modest norm better than leaving the domain entirely unaffected? When an incident occurs involving the manipulation of the integrity of a financial institution’s data, what cooperation are states expected to provide? What are current gaps in cooperation among computer security incident response teams and among law enforcement agencies? What information are states expected to share? Should states be expected to accept joint investigative teams? Should states be expected to pass new or to amend existing laws criminalizing such activity on their territory and for all their citizens independent of where the activity occurs, if they do not already exist? Should states be expected to support punitive action through the UN Security Council in case of violations by a state? Does the state need to be a member of the agreement or should the agreement be complemented by a UN Security Council resolution to apply to the entire UN membership? What best practices among members of the Convention on Cybercrime can be adopted for this narrower type of incident? What measures beyond existing cooperative mechanisms among members of the Convention on Cybercrime ought to be included? What could a template incorporating these details look like? Can techniques be developed to detect intrusions that undermine the integrity of financial institutions’ data? And can techniques be developed to distinguish between intrusions for intelligence-gathering and those that would also be able to corrupt data? What notification requirements and regime should be in place for states to become aware of such incidents? What protections must exist?

Finally, we acknowledge that other sectors, such as telecommunications and energy, and the integrity of data of other systems are critical for the financial system. However, any agreements covering these sectors are even more complicated to negotiate and to implement effectively. We therefore offer this proposal as the start for what is likely going to be a prolonged process until an effective comprehensive security regime can be put in place.

Appendix: A Review of Past Cyber Incidents Involving Financial Institutions

This section outlines significant cyber incidents targeting financial institutions around the world from 2011 until December 2016, with the addition of a few selected important incidents between 2007 and 2011. It is noteworthy that there is no public data that any of the incidents involving the manipulation of the integrity of financial institutions’ data appear to involve states; this suggests states are exercising restraint so far, except for the disk-wiping attack against South Korean financial institutions allegedly carried out by North Korea, and perhaps the low–level, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks targeting Russian financial institutions in December 2016.

The cyber incidents listed in the table below include defacement of websites, DDoS attacks, and intrusions using more sophisticated malware. The targets of the incidents were mainly banks but also one stock exchange and one payment system, and the countries whose financial sectors were hit include Belgium, Brazil, Estonia, Georgia, Lebanon, Russia, South Korea, Ukraine, and the United States. In many cases, it is difficult to know with certainty who perpetrated the attack, but the suspected attackers range from criminals and hacking groups acting independently, to hackers acting under state sponsorship and states themselves. This review was part of the authors’ preliminary research and supported the assumption that states already exercise significant restraint in this area compared to what is technically possible.

2016 DDoS Attacks Targeting Russian Financial Institutions

On December 2, the Russian Federal Security Service announced that it had discovered pending cyberattacks intended to impact “a range of major Russian banks” starting from December 5.30 Servers and command centers purportedly to be used in these attacks were located in the Netherlands and owned by a Ukrainian hosting company named BlazingFast. Its director, Anton Onoprichuk, said he had no information about the asserted attack and that his company was unable to find any malicious data. The Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice said that it was aware its infrastructure could be used for cyberattacks elsewhere, and in a statement noted that “in case . . . a cyberattack does occur on Monday, then it is up to the Russian authorities to decide whether to start an investigation. . . . If desired, they can ask the Dutch investigating authorities for assistance.”31

On December 9, Rostelecom, Russia’s telecom operator, said in a statement that it had blocked DDoS attacks against the five biggest banks and financial institutions in Russia on December 5. They reached a peak volume of 3.2 million packets per second, which is low compared to the volume of other recent DDoS attacks, and the longest lasted a few hours. The statement further noted that part of the DDoS attacks involved a botnet similar to that used in prior weeks against Germany’s Deutsche Telekom and Ireland’s Eircom, exploiting a vulnerability in home routers.32

There was no identification of state actors or perpetrators of the attack, though the Russian Federal Security Service claimed that it was being organized by “foreign intelligence services” and speculation remained that due to the servers’ location and ownership, this had been an action on behalf of Ukraine.33 The Russian Federal Security Service stated that it expected the DDoS attacks to be accompanied by text messages, agitating social network publications, and blog statements about a “crisis in the Russian credit and financial system, bankruptcy and withdrawal of licenses of leading federal and regional banks,” and that “the campaign [would be] directed against several dozen Russian cities.”34 Presumably, this would be an attempt to create a run on Russian banks, initiating a financial crisis. No evidence exists that such action, complementary to the DDoS attacks, was attempted.

2016 Bangladesh Central Bank Heist

In February, media reported that hackers had breached the network of the Bangladesh central bank and sent thirty-five fraudulent transfer requests to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, totaling nearly $1 billion.35 Four of these fraudulent requests succeeded and the hackers were able to transfer $81 million to accounts in the Philippines, representing one of the largest bank thefts in history.36 A fifth request for $20 million to be sent to an account in Sri Lanka was stopped when a misspelling of the recipient’s name, “Shalika Fandation” rather than “foundation,” raised suspicions.37 The remaining transfers, which totaled somewhere between $850 and $870 million, were also stopped before they could be completed.38

The hackers had introduced malware onto the Bangladesh central bank’s server and deployed keylogger software that allowed them to steal the bank’s credentials for the SWIFT system. The hackers also custom-designed a malware toolkit that compromised SWIFT’s Alliance Access system and was designed to cover their tracks. 39 This toolkit allowed them to delete records of transfer requests, bypass validity checks, delete records of logins, manipulate reporting of balances, and stop attached printers from printing transaction logs. Although the malware was custom-designed for the theft, the toolkit could potentially be used against other banks in the SWIFT system running Alliance Access software.

The cybercriminals had monitored the bank’s routine activity in order to create money transfer requests that appeared genuine and timed the thefts over the weekend in Bangladesh when the Federal Reserve reached out to confirm the transactions, and then it was the weekend in New York when the Bangladesh central bank employees instructed the Federal Reserve to cancel the transactions.

2016 Belgian National Bank DDoS Attack

On February 22, a hacking group called DownSec Belgium shut down the website for Belgium’s National Bank for most of the morning using DDoS attacks. 40 Little information has been reported about the attack, but it followed similar DDoS attacks by the same group against the websites for the Belgian Federal Agency for Nuclear Control, the country’s Crisis Center, and Belgium’s federal cyber emergency team. DownSec Belgium claims to fight against corrupt government abuses.

2015 Dip in the Shanghai Stock Market (uncertain incident)

Beginning on June 12, the Shanghai Composite Index began to crash, and by June 19 it had fallen by 13 percent. 41 Chinese stock markets continued to fall throughout July and August, and again in January and February 2016. 42 Although there is no public evidence, some have speculated that the sudden crash may have been caused by a cyberattack. 43

2015 Russian Banks’ Thefts From the Banks’ Own Customers

There’s little information available on this incident currently, but SC Magazine UK recently reported that the Russian Central Bank revoked the licenses of three Russian banks in 2015 because an investigation uncovered evidence that current and former bank employees had been using cyberattacks to withdraw money from the accounts of their own clients, as well as to cover up other crimes and violations committed by the banks. 44 The Russian Central Bank reported that in the last quarter of 2015 alone, more than $20 million was stolen from the accounts of clients with what the central bank suspects was the knowledge or direct participation of the banks themselves. The central bank also reported that these hacks were likely the result of huge cuts to the financial industry in Russia over the preceding year, and these cuts had left disgruntled former bank employees willing to collaborate with hackers and left the banks unwilling or unable to shoulder the cost of upgrading their cybersecurity.

2015 Malware Currency Manipulation Through Russian Bank

Russian-language hackers used a virus called the Corkow Trojan to hack into the computer systems of Russian-based Energobank starting in September 2014. 45 They were able to harvest credentials, launch their own trading software, and, on February 27, 2015, they placed more than $500 million in orders at nonmarket rates that caused the exchange rate to swing with extreme volatility between 55 and 66 rubles per dollar for a period of fourteen minutes. 46 Interestingly, it doesn’t appear that the hackers made any significant profit directly from the operation itself, although it’s possible that they took advantage of their insider knowledge to profit in other markets. It’s also possible that this attack was a pilot exercise for future attacks. Energobank has claimed losses of $3.2 million due to the trades.

2015 Metel Malware Attack on Russian Banks

A group of cybercriminals used the previously discovered Metel banking Trojan to steal directly from banks rather than end users. The criminal gang—which is believed to consist of fewer than ten members—used spear phishing emails or browser vulnerabilities to hack into parts of the banks’ systems that had access to money transactions, such as the computers used by call center operators or the banks’ support teams. Once inside, the Metel malware automated the rollback of ATM transactions. This allowed the criminal group to use cards from the compromised banks to withdraw a virtually unlimited amount of money, because after each transaction the balance on the account automatically reset to the same amount. No infections of this kind have been detected outside of Russia. 47

2015 Ukrainian Ministry of Finance Data Breach

In May, the pro-Russian hacktivist group CyberBerkut claimed to have hacked into the network of the Ukrainian Ministry of Finance. 48 The group posted what it claimed were documents stolen from the network, demonstrating that Ukraine was unable to service its external debt. The veracity of the group’s claims and the means by which they allegedly gained access to the ministry’s network remain unknown. See the 2014 Ukrainian data breach entry for more information on CyberBerkut.

2014 Warsaw Stock Exchange Breach

In October, a group claiming to be affiliated with the so-called Islamic State hacked the internal networks of the Warsaw Stock Exchange and posted dozens of login credentials for brokers online. 49 The means by which the group gained access to the exchange’s networks are unknown, but they were reportedly able to infiltrate an investment simulator and a web portal for managing the stock exchange’s upgrade to a new trading system, as well as render the exchange’s website unavailable for two hours. 50 Exchange employees say that the trading system itself was not breached. NATO officials later indicated privately that they believed that the hacking group’s claim of being affiliated with Islamic militants was a false flag operation, and that in fact the breach was conducted by APT 28, a group widely believed by security researchers to be affiliated with the Russian government. 51

2014 Ukrainian Bank Data Breach

In July, the pro-Russian group called CyberBerkut hacked into PrivatBank, one of Ukraine’s largest commercial banks, and published stolen customer data on VKontakte, a Russian social media website. 52 The means by which they gained access to the data is unknown. It is believed that they targeted PrivatBank because the bank’s co-owner, Igor Kolomoisky, had offered a $10,000 bounty for the capture of Russian-backed militants in Ukraine. 53 CyberBerkut warned PrivatBank customers to transfer their money to state-owned banks. CyberBerkut may have connections to the Russian government, but the relative lack of sophistication of their attacks has led some experts to conclude that official links are unlikely. 54

2013–2015 Carbanak Malware Attack on Various Banks

A group of criminals used Carbanak malware to attack financial institutions including banks and electronic payment systems in nearly thirty countries. The malware installed a RAT (remote access tool) that allowed the criminals to surveil the banks’ daily operations using video feeds and photos over a period of months. 55 The group was then able to order ATMs to dispense cash at terminals and impersonate bank officials to order fraudulent transfers. However, the largest amounts of money were stolen when criminals impersonating bank officers hacked into the banks’ accounting systems and manipulated account balances so as to inflate the amount of money available and then transfer the additional money, so that the balance then returned to the original amount. The targeted countries included Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Ireland, Morocco, Nepal, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 56

2013 Malware Attack on South Korean Banks

This was an attack on March 20 that used what’s known as Dark Seoul malware against the computer networks of three South Korean banks—Shinhan, Nonghyup, and Jeju—resulting in data deletion and disruptions to ATMs and mobile payment systems. 57 Shinhan Bank’s internet banking servers were temporarily blocked for part of the day, leaving customers unable to perform online transactions, while operations at some branches of Nonghyup and Jeju were paralyzed for two hours after the virus erased files on the infected computers. A fourth bank, Woori, reported hacking but suffered no damage. Several Korean media organizations were also hit by the attacks: their computers were frozen but they were able to maintain normal broadcasts. 58 South Korea attributed the attack to North Korea. 59

2012–2015 Crime Ring Responsible for JPMorgan Data Breach

In August 2014, JPMorgan reported a massive data breach in which hackers had gained access to contact information for over 80 million account holders, representing the biggest data breach of a U.S. financial institution in history. 60 Although there was initial speculation that the Russian government had been involved, 61 federal authorities indicted four men in November 2015 for the data breach, which they said was part of a huge operation that involved hacking into other financial institutions, a stock-pumping scheme, and online gambling operations that in total had netted them $100 million. 62 The criminals used the email addresses they gained through the JPMorgan hack to run a stock price manipulation scheme and also hoped to set up their own brokerage firm using the stolen data to contact potential customers. 63 Although the JPMorgan hack was their biggest, the crime ring had also hacked six other financial institutions, Scottrade, E-Trade, Dow Jones (the parent company that owns the Wall Street Journal), another financial news organization, and several online stock brokerages. 64

2012 and 2014 DDoS Attacks Against Brazilian Banks

In January 2012, the hacker group Anonymous used DDoS attacks to take down the websites of some of the country’s biggest banks, which they said was intended to protest corruption and inequality in Brazil. 65 The attacks, which they dubbed #OpWeeksPayment, shut down the websites for Banco do Brasil, Itaú Unibanco, and Bradesco, among others, for hours at a time. 66

In June 2014, Anonymous launched another series of DDoS attacks, this time to protest the World Cup. 67 The attacks, called #OpHackingCup, took down several Brazilian websites including the Bank of Brazil. Other websites that were targeted included Brazilian government websites, Hyundai Brazil, and the official World Cup site. 68

2012–2014 Malware Attack on Brazilian Payment System

Cybercriminals used “man-in-the-browser” malware to target Boleto Bancario, a popular Brazilian payment system. The payment system allows businesses to issue paper or online boletos (tickets) with a barcode that customers can use to remit money at a bank. 69 The malware injected itself into browsers on nearly 200,000 infected computers, where it was able to intercept and alter legitimate boletos so as to route payments into the hackers’ own accounts. 70 The attack compromised $3.75 billion in transactions, although it is unclear how much of that money the criminals were able to successfully deposit into their own accounts. 71

2012–2013 DDoS Attacks on U.S. Financial Institutions

These were two coordinated waves of DDoS attacks against U.S. financial institutions’ websites, the first in September–October 2012 and the second in December 2012–January 2013. 72 An Islamic hacktivist group called the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters claimed responsibility for the attacks, which they dubbed Operation Ababil, 73 but U.S. government officials have privately indicated to media that they believe Iran is actually responsible. 74 The scale of the attacks was unprecedented in the number of financial institutions hit and the amount of traffic flooding the sites, with one security researcher commenting that “there have never been this many financial institutions under this much duress.” 75 Although the group announced the attacks and the targets in advance both times, the banks were unable to defend themselves and access to the websites of many U.S. financial institutions was disrupted, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, PNC, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, BB&T, and HSBC. 76 Defensive and remedial measures have cost the banks millions of dollars to date. 77 Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters announced two more waves of cyberattacks in 2013, but they appear to have been less effective. 78

2012 Possible Manipulation of the Shanghai Stock Exchange (uncertain incident)

On June 4, the Shanghai Composite Index opened at a figure of 2,346.98, and fell exactly 64.89 points by close. 79 June 4 is the anniversary of Beijing’s infamous 1989 crackdown on student-led protests in Tiananmen Square, prompting many in China to speculate that both figures may have been intended to represent the anniversary of the tragedy. 80 The number 2,346.98 can be read backwards as the year, month, and date, followed by 23 to represent that 2012 marked the twenty-third anniversary of the protests. Similarly, many observers in China speculated that the 64.89 points that the stock market fell that day also represented 6/4/89. The apparent coincidence led to widespread, but unproven, speculation that the index may have been hacked and manipulated in order to produce those numbers. Numerology is very significant in Chinese culture, and Chinese citizens have been known to use numbers as a subtle form of protest in the past.

2011–2012 Gauss Virus Infecting Lebanese Banks

On August 9, 2012, the Russian security firm Kaspersky Lab announced the discovery of the Gauss virus, which is designed to steal data from Lebanese banks—including the Bank of Beirut, EBLF, BLOM Bank, ByblosBank, Fransabank, and Credit Libanais—as well as from users of Citibank and PayPal. 81 Kaspersky’s experts concluded that the virus is state-sponsored malware designed by the creators of Stuxnet, Flame, and the Duqu collection of espionage Trojans. 82 More than 2,500 computers belonging to Kaspersky customers have been infected in twenty-five different countries—1,660 of those in Lebanon—although the security firm cautions that the total number of infected machines may number in the tens of thousands. 83

Once a PC has been infected, the Trojan steals detailed information, including browser history, passwords, cookies, system configurations, and online banking account credentials, and also installs a special font called Palida Narrow, the purpose of which is unknown. 84 Most interestingly, Gauss contains an encrypted payload that security researchers have been unable to decipher, indicating the presence of a significant exploit that the virus’s creators clearly considered important to protect. 85 Given that Lebanon serves as a banking hub for the entire Middle East and that the opacity of the country’s banks has often been a concern for financial regulators seeking to disrupt terror financing and money laundering, it seems likely that the virus may be designed to monitor and/or disrupt money flows deemed threatening to the sponsor state’s national security. 86

2011 Malware Targeting a South Korean Bank

This incident targeting the banking operations of Nonghyup, a South Korean agricultural cooperative, began on April 12. The malware initially infected Nonghyup’s systems in September 2010 when a subcontractor inadvertently downloaded it onto a laptop, which the attackers used to spread the malware throughout the bank’s networks. 87 The attack destroyed the records of some credit card customers and caused a three-day service outage affecting ATMs, online and mobile banking, and credit card usage. South Korea attributed the attack to North Korea. 88

2010 Nasdaq Intrusion

The intrusion of Nasdaq’s networks was first reported in an exclusive Bloomberg Business exposé in 2014. 89 In October 2010, the FBI detected an intrusion into Nasdaq’s computer servers. The intrusion utilized two zero-day vulnerabilities and resembled malware previously designed by Russia’s main intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service. The malware first entered through Nasdaq’s Directors Desk, a system that hundreds of companies use to share confidential financial information among board members. Nasdaq’s own statement at the time reported that the incursion was limited to that system alone, although Bloomberg’s reporting indicated that, in fact, the incursion may have spread more widely through the stock exchange’s networks while never accessing the trading platform itself.

The NSA initially believed the malware was capable of causing widespread disruption to Nasdaq’s computer networks and of possibly wiping the entire exchange. There were also indications that a large cache of data had been stolen, although investigators had little proof of what exactly had been taken. The CIA later argued that the malware was less destructive than originally believed, and that while it couldn’t completely wipe a computer system it could take over certain functions and use them to disrupt the network. The investigators ultimately concluded that the intrusion was primarily designed to steal critical proprietary technology for Russia to imitate or incorporate into its own stock exchanges as part of a push to turn Moscow into a global financial hub. The malware has not been publicly analyzed and Bloomberg’s reporting included few details, so further technical information about the malware and its capabilities is unavailable in open-source literature.

2008 Website Defacement During the Russo-Georgian War

Offensive cyber operations against targets in Georgia began on July 20, prior to the outbreak of the war itself, and continued until mid-August when the conflict ceased. 90 This was the first ever combination of offensive cyber operations with kinetic war and was allegedly carried out by the Russian government or Russian hacktivists with ties to the government. 91 On the day that the kinetic war began, websites sprang up with lists of websites to attack, precise instructions, and survey forms for hackers to report their actions after the fact, demonstrating a telling degree of advance preparation and foreknowledge of the beginning of the conflict. 92 The operations consisted of website defacements and DDoS attacks, with targets including the Georgian president’s website and other government sites. The only impact on the financial sector was the defacement of the National Bank of Georgia’s website. 93

2007 DDoS Attacks Against Estonia, Including Estonian Banks

A series of coordinated DDoS attacks against Estonian government, bank, university, and newspaper websites began on April 26, lasting for three weeks. 94 During the first week, the DDoS attacks targeted only government and political parties’ email servers and websites, while in the second week the target list expanded to include Estonian news websites. 95 In order to bring their websites back online, network administrators had to shut them off to foreign traffic, ironically limiting the ability of Estonia’s media to tell the rest of the world what was happening.

The third wave of the attack, which began on May 9, was the heaviest yet and focused on the Estonian banking sector. 96 These attacks forced two major Estonian banks—including Hansabank, the country’s largest—to suspend online banking operations while also severing the banks’ connection to ATMs and preventing customers from using Estonian debit cards outside the country. 97 This wave of attacks was heaviest on May 9–10, and then slowly decreased thereafter until ending on May 19, when the hackers’ botnet contracts appear to have expired. 98

The attacks were carried out by Russian hacktivists communicating openly on Russian-language chatrooms, where users shared precise instructions on how to conduct the attacks. Estonia accused the Russian government of being responsible for ordering the attacks but couldn’t produce definitive proof. 99

Das and Jonathan Spicer, “The SWIFT Hack—How the New York Fed Fumbled Over the Bangladesh Bank Cyber-Heist,” Reuters, July 21, 2016, http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/cyber-heist-federal/.

3 States’ reliance on financial data and the system’s interdependence is likely to increase. For example, in December 2015, the New York Times ran a story about the Swedish government’s effort to move the country to an entirely cashless economy, and the UN is supporting countries’ efforts toward cashless economies through its Better Than Cash Alliance. The Indian government is also pursuing a cashless economy. See Liz Alderman, “In Sweden, a Cash-Free Future Nears,” New York Times, April 26, 2015, http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/business/international/in-sweden-a-cash-free-future-nears.html?_r=0; Better Than Cash Alliance, accessed April 21, 2016, https://www.betterthancash.org/; “From Eradicating Black Money to Cashless Economy: PM Modi’s Changing Narrative Since Demonetisation,” Indian Express, December 22, 2016, http://indianexpress.com/article/india/demonetisation-modi-cashless-economy-black-money-narratives-4439843/.

4 Disk-wiping malware can be included here. Meanwhile, efforts to break cryptography as part of intelligence data collection would not be covered by such an agreement. We also propose that states study the potential inclusion of data availability of certain critical systems as part of such an agreement but recommend exploring this in a follow-up process given the definitional challenges involved.

5 We are not the first to propose such an agreement but believe that this publication presents the most detailed and comprehensive analysis and proposal to date. For example, Richard Clarke and Robert Knake proposed a similar norm in their 2011 publication; see, Richard A. Clarke and Robert K. Knake, Cyber War: The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About It (New York: HarperCollins, 2011), 269. Greg Austin and Eric Cappon at the EastWest Institute also wrote a short paper on this issue, making the analogy to the 1997 Convention on Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons; see, Greg Austin and Eric Cappon, “Internationally Protected Facilities in Cyberspace: The Examples of Stock Exchanges and Clearing Houses,” EastWest Institute, December 2014.

6 A moral hazard problem through such an international agreement is theoretically possible but unlikely given the significant threat from nonstate actors. Moreover, pressure to improve resilience through stronger due diligence already exists and an international agreement restraining state behavior would therefore follow and complement such existing efforts.

14 With regard to counterfeiting currency in wartime, the general counsel of the International Monetary Fund, Francois Gianviti, wrote in a 2004 article, “Does the prohibition against counterfeit currency apply in times of war? There have been instances of such practices.” For example, Germany’s Operation Bernhard targeted the British economy in World War II. The U.S. government reportedly counterfeited Vietnamese and Iraqi currency during its wars with those countries. F. A. Mann, The Legal Aspect of Money, 5th ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992);“Nazi Fake Banknote ‘Part of Plan to Ruin British Economy,’” Telegraph, September 29, 2010, http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/8029844/Nazi-fake-banknote-part-of-plan-to-ruin-British-economy.html; Lizzie Suiter, Jennifer Hucke, and Courtney Schultz, “The War at Home: A Look at Media Propaganda in WWII, Vietnam, and the War in Iraq” (final paper, Stanford EDGE program, December 2004);

18 The most recent and well-documented example of a violation of this norm is the superdollar—the counterfeiting by North Korea; Stephen Mihm, “No Ordinary Counterfeit,” New York Times, July 23, 2006, http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/magazine/23counterfeit.html.

21 For example, the U.S. military destroyed a building in Mosul that housed millions of dollars of currency in January 2016 in an “overall effort to degrade [the Islamic State’s] financing.” Unlike the previous examples of counterfeiting currency during wartime, this is an example for the destruction of physical currency; Charlie Dunlap, “The Loyola Conference and the Evolving Definition of Military Objective,” Lawfire (blog), Duke University, February 14, 2016, http://sites.duke.edu/lawfire/2016/02/14/the-loyola-conference-and-the-evolving-definition-of-military-objective/.

22 One could argue that the U.S. war-sustaining doctrine as such would not need to be changed for such an agreement if it distinguishes between potentially permissible targeting of financial institutions in their physical form but prohibits targeting the integrity of financial institutions’ data.

22,22,FL-2017-000046-BGD,And the Winners of the Big Data Innovation Challenge Are... - World Bank Group,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/03/27/and-the-winners-of-the-big-data-innovation-challenge-are,"Coming to grips with the enormous challenge of climate change will require big decisions with the potential for long-term global impacts. Technological advances in geospatial mapping, digital networks and computing have provided us with a valuable ally – global data.

To harness its power, the World Bank launched the Big Data Innovation Challenge last October. It was a global call for data solutions to address increasingly pressing issues surrounding climate resilience in specific sectors: Food Security, Nutrition, Forests and Watersheds.

Individuals, students, entrepreneurs, start-ups, academia, private companies, nonprofits and public sector agencies from member countries of the World Bank Group shared innovative solutions and ideas for tackling real-world, actionable climate challenges.

The Challenge was jointly created by the World Bank’s Big Data, Climate Change and Development Economics Data teams in close collaboration with an advisory group that included global experts from the World Economic Forum, NASA, the UN’s Global Pulse, the US State Department, and the World Food Program. Winners and finalists were selected through a multi-round evaluation process that involved close to 40 judges, including data scientists and sector specialists.

Given the quality and the quantity of proposals received, it was no easy task for the selection committee to choose the winners and finalists, but now we can finally announce them here.

Winners:

• The award in the category of Food Security goes to the Stanford Sustain team, for an innovative solution that uses satellite and machine learning to predict crop yield: “The challenge was very exciting for us as it presented us a chance to analyze big data to solve real problems on the ground.” said Jiaxuan from Stanford Sustain. “We believe our Crop Yield Mapping solution will help farmers, organizations and governments make better crop related decisions around planting and food security.”

• The award in the category of Forests and Watersheds goes to the Water Cloud team, for a cloud-based platform to support water resource planning: “Through such initiatives we are able to raise people’s awareness of the importance of big data and how it can help to build a better big data ecosystem across public and private sectors.” Said Amit Parashar, from Water Cloud. “Through Water Cloud we want to make sophisticated water modeling more accessible and valuable to Policy Makers.”

Finalists:

• FluroSat developed a unique crop-health imaging system to be deployed by means of air or space systems (e.g. nanosatellites) that will provide early detection and identification of stress in wheat crops.

• Chennai Flood Management provided an online collaboration platform where citizens, engineers, property developers and government organizations can cooperate to develop coordinated, sustainable solutions to a city's flood challenges.

• The Multi-hydrometeorology-hazard Early Warning and Action System (MAWAS) project team developed an early-warning and watershed-monitoring system to support communities in Indonesia's rural and urban areas.

• Map for Environment have designed maps and mapping tools for monitoring the world's forests and watersheds.

• Geosurvey developed an online platform for crowdsourcing the analysis of geospatial data, including both satellite imagery and pictures taken with handheld devices.

• Cornell University Crop Yield Resilience Research Group proposed a robust predictive system of agricultural production and climate resilience that will harness and synthesize a wealth of global datasets from multiple sources and scales.

• The Banana Network uses artificial intelligence to estimate banana productivity by analyzing weather and climate information. It will help local farmers and producers make smarter investments, market transactions and to take early action to mitigate natural disasters.","Mon, 27 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/photos/780x439/2017/mar-4/Top-big-data-2.png,"['winners', 'crop', 'data', 'big', 'water', 'global', 'innovation', 'climate', 'challenge', 'food', 'world', 'system']", 
23,23,FL-2017-000046-BGD,The river as being - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-river-as-being/article17668210.ece,"The judgment enhancing the status of rivers is hardly game-changing

In a recent judgment, the Uttarakhand High Court declared the rivers Yamuna and Ganga as legal or juridical persons, enjoying all the rights, duties and liabilities of a living person. Indian courts have granted this status to temple deities, religious books, corporations, etc., but it is for the first time that an element of the natural environment has been declared a legal person. And it is not just the two rivers — all their tributaries, streams, every natural water body flowing continuously or intermittently of[f] these rivers will enjoy this status.

The dismal ecological state of these rivers, as well as the variety of factors responsible, is well documented. And so are the crores of rupees spent by government agencies to (unsuccessfully) attempt a clean-up. Could this judgment be a game-changer?

Before answering that question, let us take a step back. What was this case about? The two issues before the High Court were: removal of illegal constructions on the banks of a canal in Dehradun, and the division of water resources between Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand (which had not been resolved since the formation of the new State). In December 2016, the High Court directed the removal of the constructions. It also directed the constitution of the Ganga Management Board (a statutory body under the U.P. Reorganisation Act 2000), and prohibited mining of the Ganga riverbed and its highest flood plain area. On the issue of resource division, the court directed the Central government to notify the settlement reached by the two States in a time-bound manner.

Three months later, when the matter came up before the court once again, the encroachments were still there, the settlement between the States was yet to take place, and the board had not been constituted. The court issued directions for time-bound action. But separately, it took three logical leaps.

Also Read This river has the legal status of a person

First, for the court, an ‘extraordinary situation’ had been created which required extraordinary measures for the protection of the Ganga and the Yamuna. From what was a clear breach of statutory duties under the U.P. Reorganisation Act, and the regrettable, though scarcely unprecedented, inability of the State to remove encroachments, the case became one concerning the protection of the health and well-being of the two rivers. The issue may have been elaborated upon in court, but the judgment, unfortunately, does not tell us more.

Second, the court recorded how the rivers provide ‘physical and spiritual sustenance’ to half the Indian population. It found the constitution of the board to be necessary for various purposes including irrigation, water supply, and power generation. And then, curiously, found it expedient to give legal status to the rivers as living persons.

Third, the court decides to exercise the parens patriae jurisdiction to declare the rivers and all their tributaries, etc. as living persons. Parens patriae, literally ‘parent of the country’, is an inherent power of the sovereign, and not the courts, to provide protection to persons unable to take care of themselves. It was (in)famously deployed by the Indian government in the Bhopal Gas tragedy case to represent the claims of the victims. The Director, Namami Gange, the Chief Secretary of Uttarakhand and the Advocate General of Uttarakhand have been appointed as the persons in loco parentis — persons who will act ‘in the place of parents’ for the two rivers. These officers are now expected to act on behalf of the rivers for their protection and conservation. They are ‘bound to uphold the status’ of the rivers and also to promote their health and well-being.

The right to sue

The judgment comes close on the heels of New Zealand granting legal status to the Whanganui river. But unlike the comprehensive Bill passed by the New Zealand Parliament recognising rights and settling claims, the High Court’s declaration is terse, and raises several questions. In the eyes of the law, living persons such as companies, associations, deities etc., have rights and duties — primary among these being the right to sue and the capacity to be sued. Which implies that from now on, the rivers can sue persons acting against their interests. But what for? Do they have a right not to be a receptacle for tons of sewage? Can they demand minimum ecological flows? A right not to be dammed, dredged, or diverted? If yes, who will sue whom? Can the Chief Secretary of Uttarakhand now sue a Municipal Corporation in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar for the discharge of effluents downstream? Or will the Director, Namami Gange, sue the Central government for approving another hydro-power project on the river? Do other riparian State governments now have less of a role in the protection of the rivers as they are not the identified ‘custodians’? And what are rivers’ duties?

The judgment does not take away existing statutory and constitutional rights and duties of citizens and government agencies to counter the pollution and degradation of these rivers. What it does do is to identify three officers who will be the first-line defenders for the rivers. Perhaps they will not be able to pass the (institutional) buck any more. But is that game-changing? Sadly, no.

27,27,FL-2017-000046-BGD,Dominant 100000-year precipitation cyclicity in a late Miocene lake from northeast Tibet - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/3/e1600762,"Although we outline a plausible mechanism for million-year time scale EASM precipitation variations during the Late Miocene, other possibilities exist. For example, some studies ( 55 – 58 ) suggest Eocene establishing of the northern Tibetan Plateau. If this is the case, the reason for the observed million-year time scale EASM variations needs further research. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that Northern Hemisphere land has at least ephemeral ice sheets before 7 Ma ( 59 , 60 ). However, the sensitivity of the EASM to small-scale Northern Hemisphere ice sheet size variation is unknown, stimulating further research.

Ice-rafted debris started to reach ODP site 918, North Atlantic Ocean, starting from ~7 Ma ( 53 ), indicating that ice sheets in Greenland had expanded to the sea by then. We attribute weakening of the EASM after 7 Ma to the initiation of Northern Hemisphere glaciations ( 7 ) and decreased Northern Hemisphere sea surface temperature ( 17 , 48 , 54 ), which caused a southward shift of the dry limb of the Hadley circulation.

The records we compile and present here demonstrate that, contrary to common thinking, northern China has become wetter since ~8.5 Ma. The South Asian records also reveal a phase of wetting during ~8.5 to 7 Ma. The C 4 plant expansion trend, initiating from at least 10 Ma, shows a reversal pattern ( Fig. 4A ) as recorded by leaf wax carbon isotope in the Indian Ocean sediments ( 48 ); higher plant leaf waxes mainly came from regions around Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, and the Arabian Peninsula. Together, the approximate synchroneity in both the East Asian and the South Asian records suggests that the growth of northeastern Tibet during the Late Miocene might have had significant effects on climate both north and south of the Tibetan Plateau ( Fig. 1 ). On the other hand, if the entire plateau or additional margins of the Tibetan Plateau experienced a phase of rapid outward and upward growth at ~8.5 Ma, as proposed by some researchers ( 49 ), this may explain the synchronous climatic wetting both north and south of the Tibetan Plateau. Regardless of the scale of the growth of the Tibetan Plateau (northeastern growth versus upward growth), it is noteworthy that oxygen isotopic compositions of benthic foraminifera at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) site 982 ( 50 ) reveal a phase of climatic cooling/ice sheet growth at ~8.5 Ma ( Fig. 4H ), suggesting that atmospheric CO 2 concentrations also declined. It is plausible that Late Miocene expansion of the Tibetan Plateau has played a role in global climate cooling, perhaps through silicate weathering ( 51 ) and increased carbon burial ( 52 ).

EASM precipitation pattern in China is determined mainly by the jet stream’s interaction with the Tibetan Plateau (mechanical role) ( 29 ) and by heating of the plateau (thermal role) ( 30 , 31 ). The Tibetan Plateau interacts with the jet stream to steer the subtropical frontal system east of the Tibetan Plateau, promoting precipitation in China ( 29 ). Intensified heating associated with a high plateau can amplify the low-pressure system on the Tibetan Plateau, amplifying sea-land pressure contrast and causing additional precipitation in China ( 30 , 31 ). When the (northern) Tibetan Plateau is low, these effects are weakened, resulting in decreased EASM precipitation ( 31 , 32 ). Therefore, upward and/or outward growth of the marginal portions of the Tibetan Plateau will result in penetration further inland of the EASM precipitation, as was recently demonstrated in model simulations ( 33 ). Sedimentological and thermochronology evidence reveals that the northeastern Tibetan Plateau experienced a phase of upward and/or outward growth during the Late Miocene ( 34 , 35 ). For example, low-temperature thermochronology data reveal that rapid exhumation occurred in the Liupan Shan ( 36 ) and the north Qilian Shan ( 37 ) areas, and sedimentary accumulation rates ( 38 ) and provenance data ( 39 ) in the Guide Basin reveal rapid exhumation of the Laji Shan during the Late Miocene. Therefore, we predict a coeval increase in inland Asia precipitation if the northern margin of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau rapidly propagated into inland Asia in the Late Miocene. However, this inference is in contradiction with the widely held idea of Late Miocene Asian drying, which is based on increased dust accumulation in the North Pacific Ocean ( 40 ) and the onset of loess accumulation on the central CLP around 8 Ma ( 41 , 42 ). Recent studies reveal that CLP dust does not necessarily come from deserts and that increased dust accumulation does not necessarily indicate inland Asian aridification ( 43 – 46 ). This is because tectonic deformation can produce dust for wind to entrain and transport downwind ( 44 , 47 ). Specifically, the older loess (~8 Ma) on the central CLP has a relatively large zircon grain size compared to the typical loess, which has been attributed to tectonic deformation–produced dust associated with growth of the Liupan Mountains and wind erosion in the Qaidam Basin ( 44 , 46 ). Furthermore, dry riverbeds have recently been recognized as important dust sources for the CLP and, by inference, for the downwind North Pacific Ocean ( 43 , 45 , 46 ).

Orbital time scale variations of monsoon and ice volume

The χ fd /HIRM record shows cyclicity, especially between 8.5 and 7 Ma when the record shows higher values than before and after. Spectral analysis of the environmental magnetic data reveals that 100-ky eccentricity cycles have the strongest signal (Figs. 4 and 5). Model simulation suggests that Tibetan uplift can amplify the EASM’s sensitivity to insolation forcing because of its thermal role on precipitation (31, 32). Several lines of geological evidence (36–39) suggest a phase of northeastward or upward growth of the Tibetan Plateau during the Late Miocene, which can explain the enlarged climatic fluctuation amplitude observed here (Fig. 4). The HTTL grain size record (Fig. 4G) shows that during ~8.18 to 7.78 Ma, there is a 400-ky-long interval where the sediment grain size is relatively uniform, indicating non–flood-transported coarse grains, but in the other intervals after 8.5 Ma, grain size pulses are associated with periodic flooding. Therefore, we compared the χ fd /HIRM record during 8.18 to 7.78 Ma with the loess χ record on the northwestern CLP during the past ~400 ky (10). The two records show marked similarities in both time and frequency domains, with the 100-ky cycle as the dominant period (Fig. 6). Similar to the Late Quaternary, the Late Miocene 100-ky cycles also consist of bundling of several precession and/or obliquity cycles (6, 61, 62), suggesting similar forcing mechanisms.

The color scale indicates power, which is scaled to percent total power, and the hatched areas illustrate the cone of influence and, hence, the edge effects of the transform. We note that warm color indicates larger power. The 400-, 100-, 40-, and 20-ky periodicities are labeled and indicated by the straight black lines. The black contour is the 20% significance level, using a red noise background spectrum.

(B) The χ record from Jingyuan in the northwestern CLP during the past ~400 ky (10). (C) The normalized χ record from the central CLP during the past ~400 ky (63). (D to F) The power spectrum of (A) to (C) (solid lines) and the lower limit of their 80% significance interval (dashed lines). The power spectrum was generated using the AnalySeries 2.0.4 software (88). For comparison, the eccentricity data (pink curves; higher value is upward) (89) during 8.18 to 7.78 Ma and 0.4 to 0 Ma are also shown in (A) and (B), respectively

These precession and obliquity signals are not as clear in the central CLP record (63) as those in the northwestern CLP record (Fig. 6, C and F). We attribute this to low sediment accumulation rate and precipitation-driven postdepositional alteration of loess deposited in situ and the underlying loess on the central CLP, which caused signal smearing (64). This explanation is supported by sedimentological observation. For example, paleosol S1 (with a depositional age of ~0.1 Ma; Fig. 6) consists of three distinct dark-colored subpaleosol units interlayered with two light-colored subloess units for the northwestern CLP, but for the central CLP site, S1 is a dark layer without subloess layers (65). Thus, to accurately record variations of the EASM, sites with high sedimentation rates and little postdepositional alteration are preferred. The HTTL section, which is next to the northeastern edge of the EASM (Fig. 1), with about four times higher sedimentation rate during 10 to 6 Ma than the Quaternary loess from the central CLP, should provide a more reliable EASM intensity signal during the Late Miocene.

In theory, the 100-ky cycles would be intensified if the climatic record shows a muted response to the cold phase of insolation forcing; however, such a response will still show dominant variability at the 23-ky band (fig. S4). Our sampling resolution is ~3.6 ky for the interval from 8.5 to 7 Ma, which is high enough to resolve the 23-ky signal. The observation that the 23-ky signal is much weaker than the 100-ky signal suggests that the EASM’s muted response to the cold phase of insolation forcing is not the main reason for the observed dominant 100-ky cycles.

Because ephemeral ice existed in the Northern Hemisphere before 7 Ma, as is suggested by the ice rafting record of southeast Greenland (53), the dominant 100-ky cycles in our monsoon record could be attributed to Southern Hemisphere insolation–driven Antarctic ice sheet forcing. There are several ways that Antarctica ice sheet size variations could affect the monsoon. First, sea level variations associated with Antarctica ice sheet size variations during the Late Miocene would have caused periodic advance and retreat of the EASM northeastern edge, as observed in the Late Quaternary (10, 12). Second, tropical Pacific Ocean water evaporation will decrease during lower sea surface temperatures associated with colder glacial climate, which would cause additional retreat of the extent of EASM precipitation. On the basis of estimates from the South China Sea, moisture evaporation associated with surface seawater cooling decreased by 1/ 8 to 1/ 4 during the last glacial maximum in comparison with current China annual precipitation (66), which can cause a significant decrease of the EASM precipitation, especially near its northwestern extent. Third, research suggests that Antarctica ice sheet size variation was an important driving force affecting the orbital time scale Asian summer monsoon intensity via changing cross-equatorial pressure gradient and amount of latent heat release during the Pleistocene (67, 68).

During 7 to 1 Ma, ice sheet expansion and shrinking occurred in both hemispheres forced by local insolation, resulting in strengthened 41-ky obliquity cycles (69). In the Late Quaternary after ~1 Ma, the Antarctic ice sheets grew to be marine-based, and from then on, the Antarctic ice sheets ceased being controlled by local insolation but was instead controlled by eustatic sea level (69). When the Northern Hemisphere has larger ice sheets and sea level is low, Antarctic ice sheets also expanded over continental shelf area exposed by sea level fall; when sea level is high during interglacials, Antarctic ice sheets lose ice by rafting and calving of the margins of the ice sheets. Thus, global ice volume variations are mainly caused by ice sheet expansion and shrinking in the Northern Hemisphere after ~1 Ma (69), resulting in the reappearance of the dominant 100-ky cycles.

The published benthic oxygen isotope records during the Oligocene and the Early Miocene (7, 70) show strong 100-ky cycles, supporting the inference that the Antarctica ice sheet was fluctuating at a dominant 100-ky periodicity before the formation of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets after 7 Ma. Furthermore, a recent study (71) separated Antarctica ice volume variations from the Late Oligocene–Early Miocene benthic oxygen isotope record on the basis of inverse modeling, and the results show that the Antarctica ice sheets were dominated by 100-ky pacing, particularly during the termination phases of the major Antarctic glaciations, further supporting our inference.

Although this mechanism is plausible, we cannot exclude the fact that CO 2 is an important forcing mechanism of EASM variability at orbital time scales. It could well be that CO 2 covaried with Antarctica ice sheet fluctuation at orbital time scales, similar to the condition for the past 800 ky between CO 2 and Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. Unfortunately, available CO 2 records (13, 72) do not yet have the resolution to resolve orbital time scale variability.

In summary, we reveal that the northern China precipitation was fluctuating at a dominant 100-ky pace during the Late Miocene. Therefore, although the dominant 100-ky cycles during the Late Quaternary are considered anomalous by the paleoclimate community (2, 3), they appear to have been the dominant cycle at least 6 to 7 My earlier in the EASM and, likely, ice sheet records. Considering the recent discovery of the Eocene onset of the EASM (73–75) and strong pre-Miocene 100-ky cycles in the Antarctica ice sheet (7, 70) and Asian aridification records (76), it is likely that the dominant 100-ky eccentricity cycles exist in the pre-Miocene EASM records when data with enough resolution are available for this older interval.

If our model is correct, under future warming scenarios where the Greenland Ice Sheet markedly shrinks and the Antarctica ice sheet is land-based again, the 100-ky ice age and EASM cycles experienced during the past 800 ky will continue because of ice sheet expansion and shrinking in Antarctica caused by Southern Hemisphere summer insolation variations, which is opposite to Northern Hemisphere summer insolation variations.","Wed, 29 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/3/e1600762/F1.large.jpg,"['sheet', 'tibetan', 'ma', 'tibet', 'easm', 'northern', 'cyclicity', 'lake', 'dominant', 'precipitation', 'plateau', '100000year', 'record', 'miocene', 'late', 'northeast', '100ky', 'ice']", 
28,28,FL-2017-000046-BGD,Migrant domestic workers in Jordan run the gauntlet between abuse and jail - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/mar/27/migrant-domestic-workers-jordan-abuse-jail,"Maricel realised too late that the window had locked shut behind her. The 31-year-old Filipina was perched outside a second floor window, blood filling her mouth where two teeth had been smashed out. She had climbed on to the ledge to flee her employer, who had grabbed her hair and bashed her face into a wall, Maricel says.

“It’s so high. I want to go back, but the glass doesn’t open. Madam is close. She is screaming, ‘I kill you now!’” Maricel says. “What can I do? I jumped.”



Maricel had arrived in Jordan three months earlier, one of the country’s 50,000 migrant domestic workers. They travel from the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Kenya, seeking jobs as caretakers, housekeepers and nannies to support their families at home.

Many get decent paid work; others are not so lucky. In a 2011 report by Human Rights Watch, half of the migrant domestic workers interviewed said employers or recruitment agency staff had physically or sexually abused them. Others have had their salaries and passports withheld, or live in poor conditions.In the fall from the window, Maricel fractured her legs and spine but managed to make it to a nearby highway, from where a bus driver helped her to a hospital. After two months in hospital she was transferred by Jordanian public security to the Philippine embassy’s shelter for abused migrants. She pressed charges and her employer was imprisoned in spring 2015.

Maricel couldn’t walk for six months. She has been in the shelter since February 2015, waiting for the legal case to be settled – her employer still has her passport and she will have to pay about 1,000 Jordanian dinars (£1,130) for overstaying her visa. “I just want to go home,” she says.

Abused migrant workers who escape their employers but don’t find shelter with their embassy face imprisonment for being illegal workers. An estimated 37% of migrant domestic workers in Jordan work illegally.

Elizabeth, from Kenya, has been in the Juweida women’s correctional and rehabilitation centre, in the south of Amman, for two weeks. “I ran away because my madam beat me,” she says, pulling her clothes aside to show bruises below her neck. Elizabeth is awaiting deportation but needs to pay her visa overstay fee first.

She shares a cell with 10 other Kenyans and an Ethiopian. Most are runaways; some have been accused of theft. “But they didn’t steal. The madams in Jordan, they will say anything,” Elizabeth says.

Under Jordanian law migrant domestic workers should be deported, not imprisoned, for violating labour or residency regulations, especially when they may be victims of trafficking and abuse, explains Linda al-Kalash, director of Tamkeen Fields for Aid, a legal centre for migrant rights in Jordan.

“There is no article in the residency laws about imprisoning them. There’s nothing about prison for someone who decided to break their work contract.”

Some domestic workers jailed for not paying visa overstay fines end up in detention for years. Of the 281 migrant worker detainees Tamkeen has interviewed, 55% were held between three weeks and four months, 18% for five to 11 months, and 5% for between one and two years. Jordanian authorities say they are committed to protecting victims of trafficking. The country passed a counter-trafficking law in 2009 and has two shelters for victims of human trafficking, one run by the government and another by the Jordanian Women’s Union (JWU).

“We put victims in shelter, not prison. We’re committed to stopping trafficking and to protecting these workers as guests,” says Basel al-Tarawneh, the government coordinator on human rights. In 2016, the counter-trafficking unit investigated 30 confirmed cases of human trafficking and sent 196 victims, mostly domestic workers, to shelters. They also exempted 11 trafficked domestic workers from paying visa overstay fines.

But trafficking is narrowly defined in Jordanian law. Many cases of abuse don’t qualify as trafficking, says Kalash, and then the victims go to prison instead of a shelter. “It may not be a trafficking case, but it’s still abuse. There’s no place for labour abuse victims, only prison.”

The labour ministry says migrant workers who abscond must face some kind of penalty.

“We have more than 50,000 maids in Jordan,” says spokesman Mohammad al-Khateeb. “Suppose 10,000 run away. If I arrest 50 or 60 every day, where should I put them?”

Many domestic workers are not victims of abuse, he adds, but run away because they want to make more money. When they become illegal they no longer come under the ministry’s jurisdiction. If migrant workers choose to leave their employer and don’t go through official channels then they have to face the consequences. “We need to have organised, legal labour,” Khateeb says. Migrant workers who want to change employer must go through a formal procedure overseen by the Ministry of Labour. This is “near impossible” for many migrant workers, says Kalash. “All the power is in the employers’ hands as they must give consent for the worker to change jobs.”

Domestic workers cannot always rely on recruitment agencies for protection either. Martha*, a Kenyan domestic worker, came to Jordan in June 2015 and worked for a year without problems. She tried to change workplaces because her employer wouldn’t cover medical fees when she got sick.

Martha says her agency sent her to different Jordanian employers on short-term contracts, collecting money each time for her residency and work permits. But instead of processing her papers, Martha says, they kept the money and she became an illegal worker, liable for two years of visa overstay charges and with no residency permit.

Martha says she was locked in an office room with other migrant women. “They would close the door at five and leave. After that one of the guys would come back and start molesting me. We were telling God to protect us. It was hell on earth.”

Martha eventually escaped to Tamkeen, which brought her to the JWU shelter. She was afraid to ask for police help, but thankful when authorities later intervened.

“We fear the police,” she says. “Because maybe the employer will say, ‘She stole something’, and they put you in jail.”

After receiving 960 complaints from domestic workers and dealing with 1,402 runaway cases in 2016, the labour ministry says it gave warnings to 27 recruitment agencies for misconduct and shut down eight agencies.

Kalash says that if domestic workers were allowed to change employers and had an official and trusted way to register cases of abuse, absconding cases would fall. “Nobody wants to be irregular. Everyone wants to be safe. You want to feel unafraid, not for anybody to arrest you, hurt you, exploit you – but right now in Jordan there is no chance for this.”

Some 687 members of 131 national parliaments of as many countries are expected to join the five-day conference organised jointly by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and Bangladesh Jatiya Sangsad. Some 1,348 delegates will participate in the conference.

Participants, including 45 Speakers, 37 Deputy Speakers and more than 200 women MPs, are expected to make specific proposals on a range of issues, from ending rising inequality to promoting women's access to financing, during the 136th assembly of the IPU.

“Taking decisive actions to end economic, political and social inequalities will be the focus of deliberations...,” according to a news release issued by the IPU headquarters in Geneva on Monday.

Founded in 1889, the IPU, a global organisation of parliaments, works to establish democracy, peace and cooperation among people.

According to the IPU, the consequences of inequality are unsustainable, causing instability and undermining human rights, said the release.

“During the IPU's Assembly, parliamentarians will concentrate on the impact of inequality on the poor, women and vulnerable groups.”

Nobel Peace Prize laureate Kailash Satyarthi will be the keynote speaker during the opening session of the debates tomorrow.

IPU members would adopt a resolution to guarantee the financial inclusion of women as drivers of development, said the release.

Joining the assembly, women MPs from different countries in their session of the Forum of Women Parliamentarians would focus on “ending the gender gap in access to financial services”, it said.

Participants are also expected to make recommendations for parliamentary action to further promote the values of democracy and to strengthen the exercise of democratic government, according to an agenda of the conference.

The IPU Standing Committee on Peace and International Security will further examine, and possibly adopt a resolution of the issue of non-interference in the internal affairs of the states in the context of world today, added the release.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will inaugurate the assembly this evening at South Plaza of parliament building. She will release a commemorative postage stamp and launch IPU web television.

The next sessions of the assembly will be held at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre (BICC).

Since its inception, the IPU has been staunchly committed to promoting stable and diverse democratic traditions by fostering parliamentary dialogue. It believes good governance and democracy are fundamental for progress in all areas of life, and parliaments have a critical role to play in promoting a better world.

According to IPU President Saber Hossain Chowdhury, every conference of the IPU offers MPs to learn from others how parliaments should function to ensure good governance, rule of law and human rights.

“Parliaments play a significant role in every country. They hold their governments accountable for their activities. So, if we maintain good relations with MPs of other countries, it will supplement our government's diplomatic efforts in international arena,” Saver, who was elected president of IPU in 2014, told The Daily Star recently.

Currently, the IPU has 171 members and 11 associate members. Bangladesh got the membership in 1972, but its membership was stripped off thrice for martial law and emergency regimes.

Addressing a press conference at BICC yesterday, Saber told journalists that the IPU assembly would create a unique opportunity for Bangladesh to showcase its economic progress and potentials before the international communities.

In the briefing, IPU Secretary General Martin Chungong said the assembly would discuss on the role of lawmakers in combating militancy and tackling climate change.

He said inequality and the culture of impunity were the prime reasons behind the rise of militancy.

IPU President Saber said the executive committee of the IPU would decide on devising strategies on how MPs could play their roles in tackling terrorism.

He said they decided to hold the assembly as a green assembly this year.

“The delegates are arriving in Bangladesh by aircraft, which emits carbon dioxide. The total amount of carbons emitted in the process of carrying delegates will be calculated and neutralised,” he said.

As the Higher Secondary Certificate examination starts tomorrow, the travel time of VVIPs and VIPs for the assembly would be set in a way so that the movement of HSC candidates is not hindered tomorrow and on April 4, he said, adding that there would be no movement of VVIPS and VIPs between 8:00am and 10:00am on those two days.

According to the IPU convention, Speaker Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, as Speaker of the host country, will act as the assembly president.

She said successful holding of the assembly would be a milestone for Bangladesh in its forward march towards flourishing democracy, and it would bring a rare honour for the country.

A four-tier security measures have been taken in and around Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport.

BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A television series based on a novel about China's anti-corruption drive has gone viral on Chinese social media and won widespread acclaim.

The actor who plays the main protagonist, Lu Yi, now has 25 million followers on Weibo, a Twitter-like service, and received 33,500 ""likes"" for a message he sent promoting the show's premiere on March 28.

""In the Name of People,"" a 55-episode show that debuted on Hunan Satellite TV, focuses on the work of the Communist Party of China (CPC) disciplinary investigators whose job is to bring down corrupt officials, whether they are tigers or flies (senior or junior leaders).

The plot follows a senior official hiding his illegal gains with a bed made of banknotes worth 230 million yuan (33.4 million U.S. dollars), and is similar to an actual corruption case, though the real life amount, taken by a former vice-mayor, was 644 million yuan.

The CPC's resolve to fight corruption and build clean government is being mirrored in the arts.

A netizen called Mizi left a message at the People's Daily's official account at WeChat saying the drama was the most exciting in years.

""The play also has a warning effect, showing the determination to hunt down all corrupt figures,"" Mizi wrote.

On Weibo, a netizen called Dengyige wrote ""the phenomenal play is a kind of reflection that our nation is making steady progress, and public opinion supports the CPC's resolution to eradicate graft.""

The 120 million yuan production cost was bankrolled by the Supreme People's Procuratorate.

Top TV and film watchdogs usually take months to approve material on corruption, but the show was approved just 10 days after submission to the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television, according to Zhou Meisen, writer of the original book.

After the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, China stepped up anti-corruption work. The crackdown has gained popular support after netting corrupt officials and creating a better political atmosphere across the country.

The sweeping fight against corruption has gained ""crushing momentum,"" according to the top leadership late last year.

China's court system concluded 45,000 graft cases implicating 63,000 people in 2016, with 35 former officials at the provincial and ministerial level or above, and 240 at the prefectural level convicted, according to the work report of the Supreme People's Court on March 12.","Sat, 01 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['goes', 'focus', 'weibo', 'viral', 'chinas', 'according', 'yuan', 'peoples', 'series', 'china', 'antigraft', 'tv', 'corrupt', 'campaign', 'officials', 'corruption', 'million', 'xinhua', 'work']",

Express News Service

If there is one law that causes the maximum discomfort to people in India’s borderlands, it is the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, or AFSPA as it is more popularly known. Any discussion on Jammu & Kashmir or the northeastern states normally ends up as a debate on whether AFSPA is draconian or justified. The Act gives sweeping powers to the armed forces in these regions to quell insurgency.

What is AFSPA?

Passed in 1958 by Parliament, the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act was initially imposed in the Northeastern region and Punjab to tackle insurgency in what are called disturbed areas. Most of these border Pakistan, China, Bangladesh and Myanmar.

Where is AFSPA applicable?

AFSPA can be invoked anywhere the government certifies as a ‘disturbed’ area due to “differences or disputes between members of different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities”.

What are the powers under AFSPA?

The Act gives absolute powers, in other words legal immunity, to Army personnel to crack down on insurgents in conflict areas. These powers include shooting to kill those believed to be acting against the Indian state. They can search and detain anyone on the mere basis of suspicion. The law assures them that there won’t be any legal backlash for such actions. The law also allows the Army to launch targeted strikes in areas declared “disturbed” under the Act

How is AFSPA officially declared?

Section (3) of the Act empowers the governor of the state or union territory to issue a notification in The Gazette of India, following which the Centre can send armed forces to the state for civilian aid. The grey area, however, is whether the Union government sends the forces on its own or only after the Governor’s request.

A state government can also suggest if the Act needs to be in force, though it can be overturned by the Governor or the Centre.

AFSPA states

Jammu and Kashmir

Assam

Nagaland

Manipur (except the Imphal municipal area)

Arunachal Pradesh (Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts and a 20-km area bordering Assam)

Meghalaya (a 20-km belt bordering Assam)

How Tripura bested AFSPA

AFSPA was initially imposed in Tripura in 1997 when militancy was at its extreme. That the State shares an 856-km border with Bangladesh did not help the situation much. The National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) and All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF) wanted the State to secede from the Union. However, almost two decades later, with the situation remaining calm and less reports of terrorist incidents, the Act was finally lifted on May 28, 2015. It was in force for 18 years. The proof of decline in terrorism and separatism is usually attributed to the high voter turnout in the 2014 Assembly polls, which witnessed 84% of voting. Though earlier also there were efforts to repeal the Act, voter anger seemed have nudged the government to lift it.

Question of alienation

The armed forces believe the AFSPA helps it in counter-insurgency operations effectively, but the local populace in the ‘disturbed areas’ is usually alienated due to the incursive nature of the Act Manipur and AFSPA Deeming Manipur to be a ‘disturbed area’, the government imposed the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) in the State in 1980.

Formed in 1949, the State has a long history of insurgency. The trouble that was rampant during the British rule intensified after Independence with at least 30 insurgent groups laying down different claims. Most of the rebel groups have their base in Myanmar.

Violence peaked during the 1990s with armed conflict among ethnic as well as infighting among the predominant Naga groups.

Where do the ultras get their funds?

They generate funds by imposing illegal taxes on National Highways in the State. Their other key fund source is drug trafficking.

What was the Malom Massacre?

Things came to a head on Nov. 2, 2000, when 10 civilians were killed by Assam Rifles personnel while waiting at a bus stop at Malom in the Imphal Valley. The security forces had opened fire indiscriminately after they heard an explosion which damaged one of the vehicles in their convoy. The deceased included a 62-year-old woman, a National Child Bravery Award winner and a a boy who was waiting to go to Imphal for his tuition. Later, 42 people were dragged out of their houses and severely beaten up by the personnel. The Army personnel had reportedly believed that they were being ambushed and thought the residents of Malom were protecting the insurgents.

That the security forces had the authority to shoot to kill on mere suspicion and conduct invasive searches, highlight the over-arching powers vested on them by the AFSPA.

Enter Irom Sharmila

Following the killings, activist Irom Chanu Sharmila, then 28, began a hunger strike demanding that the government repeal the draconian act. She was arrested and re-arrested several times over her 16-year-long hunger strike that she decided to finally end on August 9, 2016. However, even this superhuman effort by a woman of modest means who survived just on fluids given through the nasal passageway failed to make the government yield.

After she ended her hunger strike, Sharmila announced her intention to join politics and floated her own Peoples’ Resurgence and Justice Alliance party. She contested against what many believed to be a formidable opponent - erstwhile Manipur CM Okram Ibobi Singh.

Ironically, the ‘world’s longest hunger striker’s’ activism went in vain, as she got only about 90 votes in the recently-concluded Assembly election.","Mon, 27 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2017/2/11/w600X390/PTI_Kashmir_7.jpg,"['refresher', 'forces', 'state', 'gives', 'personnel', 'army', 'heres', 'kashmir', 'indian', 'disturbed', 'afspa', 'tripura', 'express', 'armed', 'does', 'powers', 'act', 'need', 'hunger']",

On March 26, 1971, Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared Bangladesh’s independence following the crackdown on unarmed Bangalis on the midnight of March 25 by the Pakistani occupation forces.

After the nine-month War of Liberation with the supreme sacrifices of three million people, Bangladesh achieved its cherished independence on December 16, 1971.

The day is a public holiday.

BSS reports, President Abdul Hamid and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina paid their rich tributes to the martyrs of the War of Liberation by placing wreaths at the National Memorial at Savar in the morning marking the day.

President Hamid first placed a wreath at the altar of the memorial followed by the Prime Minister.

After placing the wreaths, the president and the prime minister stood in solemn silence for some time as a mark of profound respect to the memories of the martyrs of the Great War of Liberation in 1971.

A smartly turned-out contingent drawn from Bangladesh Army, Navy and Air Force presented a state salute on the occasion, while the bugles played the last post.

Speaker Dr Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, ministers, advisers, mayors of Dhaka North and South City Corporations, parliament members, chiefs of the three services, freedom fighters, foreign diplomats and high civil and military officials were present on the occasion.

Later, flanked by senior leaders of the party, Sheikh Hasina, also the president of Bangladesh Awami League, laid another wreath at the National Memorial on behalf of her party.","Sun, 26 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/independence-day.jpg?itok=gHTB1LWE,"['independence', 'president', 'nation', 'liberation', 'war', 'national', 'prime', 'martyrs', 'memorial', '47th', 'day', 'sheikh', 'bangladesh', 'marks']",

Lingering bad feelings resurface when Blondie's Debbie Harry refuses to let ex-bandmates Frank Infante and Nigel Harrison join the rest of the group to perform ""Heart of Glass"" and other hits. The Sex Pistols boycott the ceremony and compare the Rock Hall to a urine stain in a statement read aloud (to much laughter) by hall co-founder Jann Wenner.

With 6,000-plus fans packed into Public Auditorium, the mood was absolutely electric as Run-D.M.C. gave emotional speeches minus the late Jam Master Jay, Wanda Jackson reminisced about Elvis Presley and Metallica brought down the house with ""Enter Sandman.""

For the finale, James Hetfield & Co. were joined by Jeff Beck, Flea, Jimmy Page, Joe Perry and Ron Wood for a star-studded ""Train Kept A-Rollin'.""

WHO GOT IN: ABBA, Genesis, the Hollies, Jimmy Cliff, the Stooges, David Geffen, Otis Blackwell, Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, Mort Shuman, Jesse Stone.

HIGHLIGHTS: Further stretching its elastic definition of rock 'n' roll, the Rock Hall ushered in Swedish pop group ABBA and Jamaican reggae singer Jimmy Cliff. Prog-rock also got its due for once, as Genesis was enshrined – although Peter Gabriel skipped the ceremony to get ready for a tour. The kudos were a long time coming for eight-time nominees the Stooges. ""Music is life, and life is not a business,"" said frontman Iggy Pop, who choked up at the podium. Quickly regaining his composure, he took off his shirt and led his band through a snarling ""I Wanna Be Your Dog.""

WHERE: Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York.

WHO GOT IN: Alice Cooper, Neil Diamond, Dr. John, Darlene Love, Tom Waits, Leon Russell, Jac Holzman, Art Rupe.

HIGHLIGHTS: This was a night for toasting cult figures, fringe characters and somewhat unsung heroes. Fresh off a plane from Australia, where he was on tour, Diamond said he didn't prepare a speech. ""I love you, too -- even though you didn't vote for me,"" he told the VIPs down front. True to form, Cooper accepted his award with a snake draped over his shoulders. ""We've always been a hard-rock band,"" he said. ""We just wanted to decorate it a little bit differently."" On ""Get Behind the Mule,"" Waits jammed with his presenter, Neil Young. ""They say I have no hits and I'm difficult to work with,"" Waits said. ""And they say that like it's a bad thing.""

It was the first time in years with that many inductees — 17, with numerous people for each band. Notably absent: Axl Rose of Guns N' Roses, who announced three days before the event that he would not attend, creating a media firestorm and the kind of publicity money can't buy.

Class of 2013

WHEN: April 18, 2013

WHERE: Nokia Theater, Los Angeles

WHO GOT IN: Rush, Heart, Randy Newman, Public Enemy, Donna Summer, Albert King, Lou Adler and Quincy Jones

HIGHLIGHTS: Randy Newman and his good buddy, fellow Hall of Famer Don Henley, gave the Rock Hall what could become its signature song to open 2013's annual induction ceremony: ""I'm Dead But I Don't Know It,'' a tune about aging rockers who keep touring long after their star has faded.

“When the [expletive] did Rush become cool?’’ Dave Grohl asked when introducing Rush. “The truth is Rush has ALWAYS been cool.’’

The Wilson sisters and Heart, who offered up “Crazy on You,’’ as well as an acoustic version of “Dreamboat Annie’’ and a rocking version of “Barracuda,’’ set the bar high for Rush and the night-ending jam, a rousing version of ""Crossroads,"" featuring the new Class of Hall of Famers as well as Grohl, Gary Clarke Jr. and current Hall of Famer John Fogerty.

WHEN: April 10, 2014

WHERE: Barclays Center, Brooklyn, NY

WHO GOT IN: Cat Stevens, Linda Ronstadt, Hall & Oates, Nirvana, KISS, Peter Gabriel, Andrew Loog Oldham, Brian Epstein, the E Street Band

HIGHLIGHTS: The original four members of KISS took the stage together, and Paul Stanley takes a shot at the Hall of Fame, saying ""The people pay for tickets, the people buy albums, the people who nominate do not. Let's not forget that these are the people who make it all possible. We just benefit from it.""

The E Street Band members were not technically inductees but were given the Award for Musical Excellence. The E Streeters, no strangers to extended stage shows, showed up in force and consumed about an hour of the overall show. Large band = many speeches.

""The band Nirvana were artists in every sense of the word"" said R.E.M.’s Michael Stipe, while inducting them. Dave Grohl accepts the award, acknowledging the band’s drummer before him, Chad Channing. Grohl also hugs Courtney Love, closing a rift.

The night wraps up with a series of women rockers fronting Nirvana: Joan Jett, St. Vincent, Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth and Lorde, who closes the show with ‘All Apologies.’

WHEN: April 8, 2016

WHERE: Barclays Center, Brooklyn, NY

WHO GOT IN: Chicago, N.W.A., Steve Miller, Cheap Trick and Deep Purple.

HIGHLIGHTS: The show started with a tribute to David Bowie. N.W.A. did not perform but Ice Cube gave a convincing and heartfelt speech to counter objections by some that rappers shouldn't be in the Rock Hall. Steve Miller was prickly — displeased that his band wasn't included and aloof to his inductors, the Black Keys. Chicago gave a speech packed full of F bombs (who knew?)... Metallica's drummer Lars Ullrich introduced Deep Purple, saying as a band they are on par with the great heavy acts like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Cheap Trick enjoyed the night with their usual joviality and started the all-star jam off with 'Ain't That a Shame"", their take on the Fats Domino classic.

Nobody can move in the area without using mask because of the air pollution created by the stone dust.

Visitors, local people, especially school going children, are the worst sufferers as both the air and sound pollution makes their life miserable.

About four hundred stone crushing machines are installed within the three kilometres area of the land port, where at least three schools and several offices are situated.

Owners of these stones crushing machines are operating their machines from morning to evening every day and sometimes till late night.

Abdus Samad, 55, a visitor from the capital, said as he was not aware about the local environment here he didn't bring any mask.

“I have to suffer a lot for not having a mask as the air here is seriously polluted due to the stone crushing,” Samad said.

Montazur Rahman, 48, a resident of Burimari village, said they feel disturbed in their homes and even can't sleep peacefully due to the loud sound of the crushing machines.

Robiul Islam, 48, headmaster of Burimari Hasor Uddin High School, said due to the loud sound of the crushing machines teachers and students cannot be attentive in the classes.

“We cannot move freely because of the stone dust,” he said adding that they have appealed to the local administration to save them from the pollution.

Dr Rafiqul Islam, resident medical officer (RMO) of Patgram Upazila Health Complex, said dust pollution can cause various types of diseases like asthma, fever, headache, weakness and can slowly damage human respiratory system.

Burimari UP Chairman Abu Sayeed Newaz Nishat said following the directives from the Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) he has already served notices to the owners to remove their machines from the area within two months.

Patgram UNO Qutubul Alam said in the last one year they have conducted mobile court drives and fined several owners, which are not sufficient to stop the practice.

Saifuddin Ahmed, inspector of Department of Environment (DoE) in Rangpur, said the owners are operating the stone crushing machines illegally as they do not have any approval of the DoE.","Sun, 26 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/stone_dust_clouds.jpg?itok=1uyfTWfI,"['owners', 'dust', 'risk', 'pollution', 'machines', 'crushing', 'stone', 'burimari', 'health', 'local', 'sound', 'area']", 
41,41,FL-2017-000046-BGD,When Bruce Springsteen Released Two Albums on the Same Day - Ultimate Classic Rock,https://ultimateclassicrock.com/bruce-springsteen-human-touch-lucky-town/,"It took Bruce Springsteen four and a half years to follow-up 1987’s Tunnel of Love. But he made up for it with a grand gesture, releasing Human Touch and Lucky Town on the same day: March 31, 1992.

The intervening years had been tumultuous for Springsteen. As the Tunnel of Love Express tour reached Europe in the summer of 1988, it was reported that Springsteen — who had mostly been successful at keeping his personal life out of the tabloids – was having an affair with backup singer Patti Scialfa and had separated from wife, Julianne Phillips.

A year after participating in Amnesty International’s Human Rights Now! tour, he did the unthinkable and fired the E Street Band, and he and Scialfa left New Jersey for Los Angeles, where they got married less than a year after the birth of their first child. The only music heard from Springsteen during this time was a pair of 1990 solo acoustic benefit shows for the Christic Institute, where he debuted six songs over the two nights.

During his absence, the alternative movement became the dominant strain of rock music, and when the albums' lead single “Human Touch” arrived, it showed just how out-of-place a glossy ‘80s production — heavy on the synths, compressed guitars — sounded in the age of Nirvana and Pearl Jam. It didn’t help that most of the E Street Band — Roy Bittan remained on keyboards, and Scialfa contributed background vocals — had been replaced by session pros like bassist Randy Jackson and drummer Jeff Porcaro. While they're excellent and versatile musicians, they lacked the innate empathy that the E Street Band brought to Springsteen’s songs.

The slick professionalism of Human Touch meant that the best songs had to fight to be heard. “Real World” worked better when performed solo on piano at the Christic concerts, but here it and “Roll of the Dice” turned into shouting matches with singer Sam Moore (from R&B greats Sam & Dave). “Man’s Job” and “I Wish I Were Blind,” the former a solid slice of pop-soul and the latter a paranoid ballad, found Springsteen effectively channeling Roy Orbison, both in vocals and songwriting, for the first time in years.

Watch Bruce Springsteen Perform 'Human Touch'

But the overall fault of Human Touch lies with Springsteen, who created his most inconsistent batch of songs to date. “57 Channels (And Nothin’ On)” worked fine as a silly rockabilly tune at the Christic dates, but faltered when placed third in the album sequence (especially with an over-serious arrangement). “Cross My Heart,” “Gloria’s Eyes” and “The Long Goodbye” are nondescript. And there’s no excuse for the travesty of “Real Man.”

Springsteen fared much better on Lucky Town. As the story goes, he was trying to find one last song to complete Human Touch, and wound up writing an entire new album’s worth of songs that reflected his newfound happiness. But rather than remove Human Touch’s weakest moments and replace them with the best of the new material, Springsteen decided to put out two separate albums.

Lucky Town succeeded in every place Human Touch failed. Playing nearly all the instruments himself, except for drums (which were supplied by Gary Mallaber), Springsteen has rarely sounded looser on record, particularly on the opener “Better Days” and “Local Hero,” a surprisingly wry comment on fame. The ballads felt more personal too, with “If I Should Fall Behind,” “My Beautiful Reward” and “Living Proof” — reportedly the song that he was originally targeted for Human Touch — serving as moving statements of hard-earned love and domestic bliss. Its prime flaws are the tunes where Springsteen interrupts the mood with social commentary, like on “The Big Muddy” and “Souls of the Departed.”

Even though they arrived on the same day, fans gravitated toward Human Touch because of its title track, a Top 20 hit that included “Better Days” on its B-side. Human Touch peaked at No. 2 and Lucky Town reached No. 3 (Def Leppard’s Adrenalize, which was also released that day, topped Billboard's album chart the next week). The lukewarm reception given to Human Touch's second single, “57 Channels (And Nothin’ On),” caused both albums to quickly slide down the chart.

A world tour, with Bittan and Scialfa on board, followed. Since then, Springsteen has rarely performed the songs from those records, though “If I Should Fall Behind” was played regularly on the 1999-2000 reunion tour with the E Street Band and during the 2006 Seeger Sessions tour.

42,42,FL-2017-000046-BGD,An Interview with Kanishk Tharoor - lareviewofbooks,https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/interview-kanishk-tharoor/,"WHAT DOES IT MEAN to be cosmopolitan in a world where state leaders threaten higher walls and salt historic wounds, pulling their citizens into further isolation? This is among the questions Kanishk Tharoor, the 32-year-old debut author of the short story collection Swimmer Among the Stars, has been asking himself. Born in Singapore, raised in Geneva, Calcutta, and New York — where he currently lives with his wife, the poet Amanda Calderon — Tharoor’s rapidly growing body of fiction, essays, and journalism upholds the liberal, multicultural values instilled in him by his parents: Tilottama, a professor of literature, and his father, Shashi, a prominent Indian author and politician, perhaps best known as the former Under-Secretary General of the United Nations. Recently dubbed a “monumental talent” by Kirkus in a starred review of his book, Kanishk may be among the first in a new generation of authors to rightfully claim a global, “post-national” identity.Along with much else, the values he inherited — and the growing threats to those values — are reflected in Swimmer Among the Stars, published recently by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. The collection spans continents and eons, jumping nimbly between genres: one story counts down the days to the destruction of a Middle Eastern city by an unnamed khan, the next traces the ecstatic journey of an Indian elephant gifted to the princess of Morocco in the late 1970s, the following imagines a near future ravaged by the effects of climate change. Regardless of the era or place they inhabit, Tharoor’s characters are often driven by the universal desire to connect with worlds outside of their own — even at the risk of heartbreak or death.Though juggling deadlines for columns he writes for two Indian newspapers, preparing the second season of BBC Radio’s Museum of Lost Objects, and shuttling between various international book festivals, Tharoor spoke with the same calm, attentiveness, and humor I remembered from our days as graduate students at NYU. Conducted over three sessions — two via Skype and the last through email, sent by the author from Dubai — our conversation touched on everything from the global rise of nationalism, the writerly benefits of Dungeons & Dragons, craft in MFA programs, a rise in sympathy for authoritarian leaders among young voters, contemporary Indian authors that more Americans need to read, the misuses of history, and more.

Yes, I mentioned the experience in a recent column for the Hindustan Times. My wife and I had a layover in Doha, Qatar, at an airport where many travelers were stranded. It’s a transit point for people from Somalia, Yemen, Iran, and other countries listed in the edict.I should say that many in my family were saddened by the ban and deeply moved by those who protested at airports across the United States. But at the same time, as that was happening, I was hearing a different, slightly callous reaction from relatives in India: their concern wasn’t with those banned, but rather the fact that Pakistan wasn’t included on the list. The history of tensions between the two nations is a huge subject; there is animosity within some of the more influential Indian groups against Muslims, a tendency to target them.Yes, since 1990. But I’m an Indian citizen, along with my twin brother Ishaan, who works as a foreign affairs writer for the Washington Post.We lived in inevitably cramped New York City apartments overflowing with books. My parents were eclectic in their interests. When I was a kid, my mother would read to us from the Bible, or from Soviet-era collections of Russian folk tales, or from the Persian national epic the Shahnameh (“The Book of Kings”). I was lucky to grow up with the serious activity of reading and writing around me. It’s a great privilege. The world of literature never seemed opaque or remote to my brother and me. As I’ve gotten older and spoken to other writers, I’ve come to realize how rare and lucky this was.I don’t think I ever rebelled, so to speak, but I definitely got interested in books and genres they didn’t care about: for a while, like many others, I loved Tolkien and read a lot of fantasy; when I was 15 or 16, I developed an odd obsession with Tolstoy and other Russian writers. But it wasn’t a rebellion. Just periods of happy exploration.I read everything Tolkien wrote. The Dune series by Frank Herbert. Also a number of pulpy fantasy books, especially during middle school.I didn’t want to go too deep into the weeds, but Dragonlance, my God, yes. At a very young age, I role-played Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, too. From eight until around 14.My twin brother and other friends at school — a very healthy collection of dorks.I don’t want to make the facile comments you hear so often, you know, where people say, “It’s all about world building,” or suggest that there’s a hard link between the adolescent fun of role-playing and my current work as a fiction writer. But it does help you absorb fundamental principles. I think the game, in many ways, has less to do with world building than the challenges of narrative — learning how to make and unmake story lines, connect plot points, and so on.No, I write for the same reasons I read, and I read to learn. I read to be filled with a sense of wonder. I don’t read to feel religion or the heights of emotion, necessarily, nor to always be brought to some kind of sentimental payoff, like what we’ve come to recognize in a great deal of so-called “MFA fiction.”I’m grateful for the authors I was introduced to, and for the time and support the program gave me to just read and write. Being forced to concentrate on craft helped me become more concerted and self-aware — but I also resented that focus.I find it strange that it doesn’t matter what you want to write, all you need is the craft through which any subject can be written. We never talked about why it’s worth writing a specific type of story, the value of adopting certain types of narratives, the importance of some narratives over others. You know what I mean? There was a strange sense that all material is equal — that craft alone makes things distinct. I bristled against this, and still do.Yes, I work as a journalist and essayist, writing for various outlets in the West, including The New York Times and the Guardian. I also write quite a bit for publications in India, where I write two columns, one for the Hindustan Times about US politics, and another for The Hindu Business Line about globalization and multiculturalism. I’m also the presenter and writer of BBC Radio’s Museum of Lost Objects , the second season of which is in the works now.Yes, the Tata Hexa Literature Live! First Book Award for Fiction, which is a nice feather in the cap.I’m very fortunate for the way it was received.It’s funny, I’ve been thinking about this a lot. I was raised in a way that I never really felt conflicted about my identity, so to speak; that was in part because I was given the tools to be able to switch frames of reference. When in New York, I have a frame of reference there; when in India, my frame of reference necessarily changes. I have the cultural, historical, political knowledge, and enough of the languages to be able to do this relatively easily. No, maybe not with ease — but without great difficulty or confusion.I think my fiction speaks to a similar desire: the desire to inhabit a culture-switching mode, where frames of reference change quite swiftly. And inhabiting an existence in which the specific part of the world where one lives — one’s nation, perhaps, or region — doesn’t restrict one’s identity.Both might be reading in English, but they’re not reading the same authors. Writers who are so well known here are often unknown in India, and vice versa. One reason why my book was well received might be that Indians are accustomed to reading fiction that isn’t about them, but about things often outside their immediate horizons: books that don’t ask them to relate, so to speak, to their own situations; they’re used to feeling out of place when reading fiction. There’s an openness, even a willingness, to be taken to the unfamiliar. While this is true among certain readers in the United States, I don’t know if it is to the same degree.Rao was one of the first to write the Indian experience in fiction in the English language. It’s strange to imagine now, but there was a time when Indians writing in English was a bizarre notion. With the exception of his first novel, Kanthapura, published in 1938, I’m not a huge fan of his work, though. It shows a stultifying and exoticized interest in a nebulous species of philosophy that might be better viewed as “spiritual knowledge” to Westerners. A sort of Orientalist, stereotypical, outmoded idea of India as a land of so-called “spiritual accomplishment.” He’s part of the canon as a pioneer, but I’m not convinced by the quality of his writing.I am Indian. I do think of myself as Indian. But I don’t know what adjective I’d use to describe myself as a writer. In terms of lineage, my writing aspires to traditions that aren’t only Indian. It follows my interests, which don’t adhere to national boundaries.I find it strange that, by the simple fact that I’m an Indian, my writing would belong in a category that somehow speaks to a broader Indian culture. But it’s a valid question. So many writers need — or maybe it would be better to say they benefit from having some fairly coherent sense of a national identity. I don’t know if I have that.Well, let me not overstate the case. In India, there are so many local languages whose literatures are often neglected and not read in the way they should be. What I mean is that Indians are often reading literature not written by Indians — whether in translation or from other English-language nations.I wrote the story to address the issue of who or what owns cosmopolitan, universal culture. For so long, that’s been synonymous with the mostly imperial European or American metropolis. Everybody else has their own national and parochial cultures, but here in these great Western cultural capitals, you have a passport to global culture that isn’t accessible to most.As a boy, I would go to a place like the old Indian Museum in Calcutta — a dilapidated, crumbling Victorian hulk with barely any artifacts — and compare that experience to what I felt while exploring the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the London Museum, or the Victoria and Albert Museum, which has all sort of amazing Indian objects taken by the British. It made me think at a young age about who has the right to culture, and what culture. The motivation here is not nationalist; it’s making the claim that non-Western nations, nations like India, can house these objects of universal culture.There are so many, I don’t even know where to begin. I hope the lovely writing of Janice Pariat can make waves here as it has in South Asia. There is so much excellent translation taking place, too, particularly by Arunava Sinha, who translates prolifically from Bengali into English. Amitav Ghosh is of course well known in the West as a novelist, but his recent nonfiction work on climate change, The Great Derangement , published by University of Chicago Press, which came out last year — is astonishing. I recommend that book highly. It’s a fascinating look at ecology, fiction, and modernity. When it comes to fiction, especially, Ghosh makes an excellent case for its purposes and failures.That was deliberate. I felt it was plausible that the United States would no longer exist in that apocalyptic scenario. I was raised in this country, I love living here and hope to continue doing so, and I have no desire to see it end. But as someone who’s lived in the West most of my life, I’m trying to find ways of engaging with the world that are at once universal — but not from a Western perspective. That doesn’t necessarily mean they’re from an Indian perspective. But from a perspective that displaces the West as the origin of the gaze, so to speak.I did my undergrad at Yale, worked for a few years in London, then had a fellowship at Columbia in history of South Asian studies, which I assumed at the time would become a PhD. But I realized quickly that I didn’t want to be an academic historian.I felt the sort of historical writing that I wanted to do wouldn’t be best served — or even enabled — by working within academia. My interests are so omnivorous. I like chasing patterns, treating history like comparative literature, in a way.It came about through my interest in language extinction. I have a good friend here named Ross Perlin, who’s the assistant director of something called the Endangered Language Alliance . New York City, not surprising, I suppose, is a repository of languages that are at risk of extinction. There are languages spoken in Queens that are no longer spoken in the hill tracts of Bangladesh, or Indonesia, or wherever else.While I do feel the ethnographers are doing entirely well-intentioned and important work, I do have this slightly ambivalent feeling about the project. I struggle with the idea that language encapsulates, in a very neat way, an identity or an entire culture’s mode of thinking. That the last speaker of a language speaks for all those who spoke that language is a slightly problematic premise: it implies that languages are static when, in fact, they’re evolving, dynamic, living — they’re inherently very messy, never pure. That ambivalence is something I was playing with, much in the same way the elderly woman plays with her language through the course of the story.Yes, indeed.There are fascinating parallels between Modi and Trump. In a speech that Trump’s advisor Steve Bannon gave to a Vatican audience in 2014, he said Modi’s victory signaled the start of a “global revolt.” According to him, Modi’s election was a “great victory” for a kind of nationalism that boded well for the West — a nationalism that structures itself against what’s perceived to be a cosmopolitan, multicultural-promoting elite.Modi is very much of that ilk. He draws support from a sort of heartland, lower middle class, aspirational middle class in India. Much in the same way that Trump managed to draw support from the American lower middle-class voters who perceived him as representing something authentically American. Or returning America to those who purportedly “built America.” In the same way, I think many of Modi’s supporters feel he’s somehow more authentically Indian, a better representative of India or Indian civilization than the leaders of other political parties.Yes, based on a study done of Indian students by the Children’s Movement for Civic Awareness. It seems more now are susceptible to the figure of an authoritarian: a leader who can bulldoze his way through, effect change in a heavy-handed way. When Indians compare themselves to China, which they often do, they see that when the Chinese want a road built, the road gets built, no matter who’s in the way. Whereas in India, we have a legal system, we have courts, and so on, meaning the delivery of that road can get bogged down, often challenged and delayed. These are the trappings of democracy, and some feel impatient with them. Figures like Modi are perhaps elected on the assumption that they can cut through the bureaucracy. He’s very much seen as an operator whose mission is simply to get things done.And you see that among Trump’s supporters as well: a reverence for his business success, a belief in this mythic idea that he can effect change quickly, while career politicians are scheming and self-interested.Modi has said many things that aren’t, strictly speaking, true. He said some strange things about history. I don’t think he’s consistently making stuff up the way Trump does, but, like Trump, he is an engaging speaker. He’s charismatic. He sounds and comes across in a more appealing way than most politicians. His speeches, like Trump’s, appeal to those seeking entertainment — in part because nobody knows what he’ll say next.You put it better than I could have.Yes, that class was brilliant.In the same way that you’re drawn to Mitchell, I’ve been reading a tremendous amount of Ryszard Kapuściński — much more intensely now, in the years since I took Weschler’s class. The difference with both authors, I think, is that their work earns the reader’s respect. You quickly come to recognize the purchase they have on the topics that interest them, the expertise they’ve developed on those topics, and the integrity with which they present them. They’re both so good that I’m willing to accept their honest perception of the world — so much so that I’m not hugely bothered by the accuracy of details.I’m laughing, because that’s uncomfortably close to the truth. But no, with Trump, there’s more of a willingness to embrace a fantasy that he’s selling — a fantasy that hinges on a fear of terror and the promise of strength. Things that many people assume will have a positive effect on their daily lives. In his method, yes — I suppose you could find an odd echo in Kapuściński. But whatever license they take with their material, Kapuściński and Mitchell offer us a clear-eyed, humane vision of the world. That’s not really in Trump’s wheelhouse.That’s my favorite part, too. Like I wrote in the preface to that section, each of them spring from an episode of “ the Alexander romance ,” a cycle of stories about Alexander the Great, which were shared by cultures as far flung as Scotland in the West and Aceh in Southeast Asia. I was intrigued with what was done with the form by Arab and Persian writers, who referred to Alexander as Iskandar, among other names, and transformed him into a Muslim hero. My stories follow their tradition.Definitely.Apart from source texts and Calvino, they were also influenced by Kapuściński’s journalism, in fact, as well as his stunning books on the Emperor of Ethiopia and the Shah of Iran.I hadn’t considered that, but I suppose you’re right.I’m laughing again, but yes, what author isn’t? My characters are my pawns. They have no agency beyond what I allow them.The implication is that it’s an Indian subject. Like with several of my other stories, it reflects my interest in how people engage with the world. And how media distorts our view of the world.No, but I know people who have been. One of my friends recently wrote a profile of a musician he’s adored since he was a teenager. After the piece was published, the musician got back in touch, and said, “You’ve destroyed me. You’ve ruined me in this piece.” It was devastating for both of them.Yes, I think so. This is why I find writing short stories easier than the novel. There’s a lot of freedom to wander. I feel I do my best thinking as I write. I find that I’ll have an image or an idea for an endpoint or a kind of fanciful conceit — from which the story will spiral into being. I often surprise myself with the direction the story takes.In general, I write straight through, then tweak later. But I’m a slow writer. I tend to revise when I write. Every day, I return through the entire story, adding a little more after a lengthy revision.No, the process there has been different. I’ve had to telegraph things much more, establish more of a balance, more structure. But I do compartmentalize when writing, so I have certain sections that I can work on, then surface again to work on others.It is historical, like much of my work. It’s set in the 15th century, following the narratives of two, as you would call them, autocrats on either side of the Mediterranean.A few short story commissions from Indian publications. I have a piece coming out in Harper’s Bazaar India: a short story based on a photo shoot done in a curator’s house, full of artwork. And of course I have my nonfiction work, my columns, and the second season of Museum of Lost Objects for the BBC.I understand completely.Personally, I see his presidency in terms of a much larger issue, a global questioning of the values I was raised under. I don’t pretend to be representative of a wide swath of society, but I was raised to believe that diversity is a virtue and also a fact of life, to believe in openness toward others and to other cultures, to believe in inclusivity: multicultural, liberal, cosmopolitan values. And now we’re seeing a kind of — I mean, even nationalist might be a wrong word — maybe it would be better to say a civilizationalist questioning of those sacred cows.And so this period has become a distressing, perilous, even exciting moment for someone like me, who’s feeling that these virtues — virtues I’ve taken for granted my whole life — are under assault. Not just here, but in Europe and elsewhere. In India, secularists and pluralists are under attack from Hindu majoritarians in the same way US populists attack effete coastal elites.If not directly then indirectly, I think my fiction is animated by the question of how we can be impure in a world that seems to be striving for cultural purity.I’m a huge fan of the Icelandic author Sjón. He writes marvelous gems of novels. I recently read Moonstone, an exquisite little book about a gay teenager 1918 Reykjavik who’s obsessed with cinema, and dealing with the influx of Spanish Influenza. Sjón wrote the novel in memory of a gay uncle who died from AIDS. Even though deep emotion powers the book, there’s a refusal to surrender to sentimentality. And you?With apocalypses in mind, you might enjoy The Wake by the British ecologist Paul Kingsnorth. He wrote it as the first in a series of books about the collapse of worlds. It’s historical, set in the 11th-century England, and written entirely in an English stripped of all its post-1066 additions — a kind of imagined proto-English. It takes a couple of pages to get into the rhythm of the language, but after that it’s so wonderfully stark.I do think that’s how many people access fiction, though: through the prism of an individual character’s desires and failings. I like using assemblages of characters; the individual doesn’t always form a building block of my fiction. I suppose that’s the influence of older, pre-modern, pre-novel modes of storytelling, from folk tales to epics and so forth — modes that aren’t as concerned with the individual, yet still manage to tell compelling stories.I don’t want to deliver some kind of sweeping judgment. It’s too early in my career to do anything that rash. But not long ago, I went to a lecture given by Argentinian writer César Aira. He complained about how in contemporary fiction you’re often entering houses, walking up stairs, into the bedroom, so the writer can open the closet door and let you count his slippers. I agree; I’m not interested in that type of writing, either. I don’t need narratives to wear their politics heavily, but again, I write for the same reasons I read: I want to learn, I want to be amazed, I want to be terrified — but most of all, I want to be brought into a world that’s not my own.

43,43,FL-2017-000046-BGD,T+2 is Coming - Nasdaq,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/t2-coming-2017-03-30,"T+2 isn't a sci-fi thriller, but it does look to the future. T+2 refers to a new, and shorter, standard settlement cycle for securities transactions. Currently, most securities transactions are settled in three business days, commonly referred to as T+3.

The Securities and Exchange Commission's new rule amendment reflects improvements in technology, increased trading volumes, and changes in products and the trading landscape that make a shorter settlement cycle both feasible and valuable to market participants.

Broker-dealers are required to comply with the T+2 rule beginning on September 5, 2017. Trades before that date will still operate on a T+3 cycle.

So, what does this change mean for you? Currently, if you buy a security such as a stock or bond, your full-service or online broker age firm must receive payment from you no later than three business days after the trade is executed. When you sell a security, you must deliver your security to the brokerage firm no later than three business days after the sale. For example, if you sell shares of a stock on Tuesday, the transaction would settle on Friday.

Starting September 5, under the new T+2 settlement cycle, most securities transactions will settle in two business days of their transaction date. For example, if you sell shares of a stock on Tuesday, the transaction would settle on Thursday (a day earlier than in the past).

The SEC cautions that if you hold a physical, paper securities certificate , you may need to deliver it to your broker-dealer earlier or through different means than you do today to meet the new shorter settlement cycle. If you hold your securities in an electronic format with your broker-dealer, your broker-dealer will deliver the securities on your behalf one day earlier. Similarly, if you are buying securities, you may need to pay for your securities transactions one business day earlier. You should contact your broker-dealer about any changes that may specifically affect you or your account.

The T+2 rule amendment applies to the same securities transactions currently covered by the T+3 settlement cycle. These include transactions for stocks, bonds, municipal securities, exchange-traded funds, certain mutual funds and limited partnerships that trade on an exchange. The T+2 requirement would not apply to certain other categories of securities, such as exempted securities.

If you have additional questions about the new T+2 settlement cycle, check out the SEC's Investor Bulletin on this topic. In addition, SEC staff has provided the following email contact for specific inquiries on T+2: T2settlement@sec.gov .

46,46,FL-2017-000046-BGD,The lime lagoon - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/the-lime-lagoon/article17758279.ece,"Lime binds Sunnambukulam on the banks of the Pulicat lake to a glorious past. Brave young men of the fishing hamlet 60 km north of Chennai take long, deep and dangerous dives and scoop out seashells from the lakebed to extract lime, a mineral used for construction at least from the Sangam age. The lime from here now breathes new life into heritage structures in Chennai and elsewhere in Tamil Nadu.

Reddiyars, as the mining community around the lake is known locally, were originally from Andhra Pradesh, just a few kilometres away, but, with the arrival of the British, moved closer to the sea for economic reasons. Several centuries ago, the community ventured into deep-water mining and set up more than 30 crusher units at Sunnambukulam and nearby villages such as Rasapapalayam, Chinna Kokkupalayam, Periya Kokkupalayam, Periya Kuppam and Kattur, where nearly 600 families live.

Divided into groups of five, the miners, mostly relatives and in their late 20s, enter the water. Each has his task cut out: one helms the sails of the boat and takes care of logistics; the “lucky” miner (one who has hit upon seashell repositories many times) divines within 5 km of the lake bund using a thin 15-foot iron rod. He plunges the rod into the 10-foot-deep water and if it hits any object, two miners dive to the lakebed to dig for seashells. Once the spot is identified and the mine dug, two teams of two miners each take over. One team collects seashells in a bamboo basket that can carry up to 20 kg. The other brings the basket to the surface. The seashells are cleaned to remove sand and clay before it is loaded on the boat, which can carry up to 20 tonnes. The work starts before sunrise and ends after sunset. On the shore, the seashells are dried for a few days before they are burnt with coal in an open furnace for 12 hours. Korrukkupet in north Chennai is the only other place where such crusher units function today. Sangam literature speaks of how lime mortar combined with jaggery and harde (Kaduka in Tamil and Malayalam) was used for construction purposes. Silappatikaram and Pattinappalai literature make frequent references to it, K. Sridharan, senior archaeologist and former Deputy Director of the Tamil Nadu State Archaeology Department, says. Thirumalai Nayakar Mahal and the Big Temple in Thanjavur are cited as stellar works made using lime mortar.

The southern and northern side of Tirusulam station are said to be indistinguishably different. This becomes almost clear to me, as I alight from a train at the station. On the north, there is the wide GST Road with LED lights and the imposing and aesthetically appealing Chennai International Airport.

I understand much about the southern side by what it lacks than what it has — for starters, there is no foot overbridge providing access to this side.

To get an objective picture of how much this section is lagging behind, I however go with Mahalakshmi, a resident of Tirusulam on her TVS champ.

Her house is located around four kilometres from the station and covering this distance, I notice that small buses don’t operate on this section. Some interior roads can be called anything but roads. This section does not have a PHC or a hospital. It is aeons since the only government school received an infrastructural upgrade.

Tirusulam is just an example of uneven development in many sections of the southern suburbs. Tirusulam is among the areas that have been proposed to be made part of the Municipal Corporation of Pallavaram. There are reasons to believe that this development augurs well localities like Tirusulam where uneven development is obvious.

Pammal is another example of a how certain localities are so close to development but don’t get to savour it as much as they should. While Pallavaram has been growing by leaps and bounds, Pammal, a neighbouring locality, hasn’t developed as briskly.

Three municipalities — Anakaputhur, Pallavaram and Pammal — and a village panchayat — Cowl Bazzar — are expected to be part of the proposed Pallavaram Municipal Corporation.

Residents of these localities are hopeful that if the proposed new Corporation sees the light, many of their long-standing wishes will be fulfilled.

“We need a grievance redressal mechanism, such as the one provided by the Greater Chennai Corporation. Currently, there’s no accountability among municipal officials,” says David Manohar, a resident of Radha Nagar, Chromepet.

Ridding waterbodies of encroachments and maintaining them is on the wish list.

“Many of our water-related concerns will be taken care of if the five water bodies — Thiruneermalai, Pallavaram Periya Eri, Nanmangalam, Narayanapuram and Keelkattalai lakes — are cleared of encroachments,” says Manohar, who is also the coordinator of Pallavaram-Chromepet chapter of Arappor Iyakkam.

He says parking needs to be enforced along GST; otherwise, it will become another T.Nagar.

There are many other civic battles that residents think the new corporation must prioritise.

Solid waste management is one of them. Mangalam Balasubramanian, founder and managing trustee of Exnora Green Pammal, says source segregation must be made mandatory.

“The new Corporations must take concerted efforts to make source segregation compulsory. ,” she says.

Also, work on underground sewerage system must fast-tracked to make solid waste management effective, Mangalam says.","Fri, 31 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/article17749780.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31DCMYPRPALLAVARANMOUNT,"['corporation', 'southern', 'station', 'pallavaram', 'development', 'proposed', 'end', 'pammal', 'municipal', 'localities', 'tirusulam', 'lopsided']", 
49,49,FL-2017-000046-BGD,Driving on wrong side rampant - The Daily Star,https://www.thedailystar.net/city/wrong-side-driving-death-trap-1382941,"It was December 25 morning Nazu Akther, 30, a garment worker, was waiting to cross the busy Mailer Matha road in Saltgola area of Chittagong city to get on a bus to go to her workplace.

Seeing the road quite free, she started crossing it keeping her eyes on the right side in case vehicles come along.

But she was not ready for the three-wheeler coming from the opposite direction. The vehicle knocked her down resulting in a lifelong disability.

She got her left leg run over by a trailer coming from the right side and within a week, the leg had to be severed while she was undergoing treatment at a hospital.

The incident which occurred over two months ago left Nazu, a resident of Saltgola area, with no work. The mother of three now can barely make ends meet with her day-labourer husband.

On June 10, 2015, another wrong-side driving accident killed a garment worker and injured two others in the area.

The accident occurred when a covered van hit a three-wheeler which was plying the wrong side of the road. The victims were passengers of the three-wheeler.

Apart form these two, minor incidents occur every day as nearly a hundred three-wheelers ply the wrong direction from Saltgola to EPZ road in the area from 6:00am to 8:00am.

During these two hours, thousands of garment workers head out to their workplace in Chittagong Export Processing Zone (CEPZ) and Karnaphuli Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) by bus and other vehicles.

As the workers wait across the right side of the road for vehicles to get on, the road gets crowded creating a gridlock for several hours. As a result, medium-sized vehicles like tempos choose to ply the wrong side of the road to ferry passengers mainly from Saltgola to EPZ intersection.

The Daily Star on June 20, 2015 published a report about the rampant wrong-side driving in the area. No actions have been taken against the violators of rules yet.

Visiting the area from 6:00am to 8:00am recently, this correspondent witnessed several three-wheelers and fast-moving vehicles like bus and trailer moving freely on the wrong side.

Many garment workers were also seen crossing the road with vehicles moving fast on both sides of the road.

Alamgir, a resident of Agrabad area and worker of a garment factory, said they have to be very cautious while crossing the road as oftentimes three-wheelers, running on the wrong side of the road may hit them.

“Small accidents occur daily on the road. These violations are only noticed when someone loses his or her life or limb,” said Alamgir.

Talking to several drivers, it was found that the three-wheelers usually run on Barik Building-Chawkbazar route. As the number of passengers is high in the morning in EPZ area, the three-wheelers flood the area. They said police do not harass them for driving on the wrong side of the road.

Assistant Commissioner of Chittagong Metropolitan Police (CMP) (port) Mosharraf Hossain said traffic police are deployed in the city from 7:00am. But they were not aware of the rules violations. Now that they are informed they will take action against vehicles that ply on the wrong side of the road.

Biplab Kumar Paul, Traffic Inspector (EPZ zone) of Chittagong Metropolitan area, said from March 1, he has impounded around 50 vehicles mostly three-wheelers, in this area for running on the wrong side of the road.

It is not possible for police alone to control the vehicles in the morning as thousands of garment workers and hundreds of vehicles pass through the road during that time, he said.

“It's not suicide. I have seen the body and it did not seem to be a suicide case. There are some suspicions,” Raudha's father Mohamed Athif, who is a physician, told The Daily Star yesterday afternoon.

Earlier in the day, doctors performed an autopsy on the body of the 21-year-old girl at the Rajshahi Medical College (RMC) morgue.

“We examined the body thoroughly and collected samples for some laboratory tests,” Prof Mansur Rahman, one of the doctors, told this correspondent.

He declined to comment about the autopsy. “We will analyse the test reports before coming to any conclusion.”

Anwar Habib, principal of RMC, had formed a three-member medical board headed by Prof Mansur for performing the post-mortem.

The body was at the mortuary till 11:30pm last night. Raudha's parents could not decide whether to take it to the Maldives or bury it in Rajshahi, said a police official, seeking anonymity.

Raudha, a second-year student of Islami Bank Medical College, was found dead in her room at the women's hostel of the college in Nawdapara area of Rajshahi city. Her body was hanging from the ceiling fan with a scarf tied to the neck.

Following primary investigation, police said it appeared to be a suicide case. They, however, said they would not come to any conclusion until they get the autopsy report.

The law enforcers collected the mobile phone and other belongings of Raudha for investigation.

Talking to The Daily Star, her parents, who flew in from the Maldives, said they saw their daughter's body at the RMC morgue yesterday morning. This correspondent had a brief conversation with them near the Rajshahi Metropolitan Police (RMP) headquarters in the afternoon.

Without giving any reason for the suspicion that Raudha was murdered, her father Mohamed Athif said, “She was not a person who would commit suicide. Suicides are committed by those who suffer from depression... She was a very happy person. She was neither depressed nor frustrated.”

Raudha was working hard for her second year final exam and she wanted to become a doctor. Her mother Aminath Muharrimath last talked to her around 11:00pm on Tuesday, hours before she was found dead.

During their conversation, Raudha told her mother that everything was alright, he said.

“There is no reason why she would take her life. She had no issues with anyone,” said Muharrimath.

After this correspondent asked Mohamed Athif why his daughter chose to study in the medical college in Rajshahi, he said they would talk to the journalists later.

Several high officials of the RMP were present there. After Raudha's parents left the place, one of them, wishing not to be named, said, “It doesn't look like a murder as claimed by the parents”

The circumstantial evidence at the scene also suggested that it was a case of suicide, he said.

Contacted, Amir Zafar, a deputy commissioner of the RMP, said it was quite normal that Raudha's parents were making such a claim.

“They are her parents. It's normal that they would think something like that. But, we are waiting for the autopsy report.”

Muharrimath flew in to Rajshahi on Thursday afternoon along with Maldivian Ambassador Aishath Shann Shakir while Mohamed Athif reached the city early yesterday.

Shakir visited the RMC mortuary along with Raudha's parents yesterday morning.

With her aqua blue eyes, Raudha became an internet sensation in her country in 2014.

After experimenting with her pictures on social media sites two years ago, Raudha hit gold with her “Maldivian Girl With Aqua Blue Eyes” shoot. Shot by Maldivian photographer Sotti for a project, the stunning image of her emerging from a gorgeous blue sea went viral, eventually helping her land on the cover of Vogue India in October last year.

Following her death, former president of the Maldives Maumoon Abdul Gayoom tweeted, “Deeply shocked by the sudden death of young Maldivian female student in Bangladesh”.

Some of her friends wrote on Facebook that they were praying for her departed soul.

On Thursday, the authorities of Islami Bank Medical College mourned Raudha's death at a meeting. They termed the incident “suicide” committed out of “a wrong decision made from depression”.

Many of the students and staff of the college are supporters of Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Chhatra Shibir, according to police and locals.

There are 500 students, including 45 foreigners, at the college. Of the foreign students, 15 are female students. The foreign students include four Maldivians.

QUESTION RAISED OVER AUTOPSY TEAM

The medical board that conducted the autopsy on Raudha's body included a doctor who works at the private medical college where the girl used to study.

Talking to this correspondent, a physician at the RMC said the inclusion of the doctor in the board might raise questions as the parents of the girl were claiming that she was murdered.

The board led by Prof Mansur Rahman of Barind Medical College includes former teacher of RMC Prof Emdadur Rahman, who is currently working at the Islami Bank Medical College, and Enamul Haque, a lecturer at the RMC.

Contacted, RMC Principal Anwar Habib, who formed the board, said,” Apart from the three doctors, there are no other forensic experts in the city. We chose them only to know the cause of the death of the girl.”

“There is no scope for anyone to do anything wrong,” he added.","Sun, 02 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/raudha.jpg?itok=3kXy_1rZ,"['rmc', 'autopsy', 'maldivian', 'parents', 'student', 'suicide', 'death', 'medical', 'raudhas', 'rajshahi', 'think', 'body', 'dont', 'college', 'raudha']",

Favourable weather, fewer natural disasters and moderate temperature made it possible to produce more shajna compared to the last few years.

Locals said people like the taste and quality of the drumsticks and the growers are hopeful of good days as demand is increasing across the country.

Nutritionist Abid Hasan of the district said drumsticks are rich in calcium, mineral salt, iron, protein, carbohydrate and some vitamins.

Drumstick is also used as a herbal medicine for treating stomach problems, high blood pressure, blood-dysentery, heart disease and other ailments, he added.

Locals said the tasty, nutritious drumsticks are sent from the district to many places across the country, including Dhaka and Chittagong. The price of the vegetable in the wholesale market is Tk 2,000 to Tk 2,200 per maund.

Shahnaj Sharmin, a college teacher in the district, said she bought a kilogram of drumstick from a vendor for Tk 80 on Friday.

Rafiqul Hasan Shujan of Santahar Yard Colony area said he had already gathered 24 maunds of drumsticks from his five trees so far, adding that a drumstick tree of medium size can produce around eight to nine maunds.

By Ians English

Guwahati, March 31: Bhutan's Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay on Friday said the progress of Assam and India's northeast region will impact neighbouring countries like Bhutan and Bangladesh.

He also recalled the over a century-old cooperation between the people of Assam and Bhutan.

Tshering said this while addressing as guest of honour a huge gathering on the occasion of the opening ceremony of the five-day-long Namami Brahmaputra river festival.

""I am wearing a special fabric today. It is made of cotton which is grown in Assam and woven by women in Bhutan. This is a symbol of cooperation between the people of Bhutan and Assam,"" Tshering said while pointing out to the traditional dress he was wearing.

""We have 266 km of border with Assam and people interact freely with each other on both sides of the border. This is the relation between Assam and Bhutan,"" he said.

The Bhutanese Prime Minister, who had arrived in Assam to participate in the Namami Brahmaputra from Paris, further said that at least 10 rivers from his country flow into the Brahmaputra.

He said that the cooperation between the people of Assam and Bhutan could be taken further for mutual benefit of people living on both sides of the border.

Calling Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal a 'spiritual brother', Tshering appealed to the Indian government to arrange for the opening of a Bhutan consulate in Guwahati.

""I am going to visit Kamakhya temple after this programme. I am going to pray that Namami Brahmaputra also becomes the most powerful river festival in the world,"" said the Bhutanese Prime Minister.

Dubai to have tower dangling in the air from space?

The building would be suspended from an asteroid orbiting 50,000kms from the earth

A New York-based firm is proposing that Dubai be the site of a futuristic, asteroid-suspended skyscraper that orbits around the world.

The speculative Analemma Tower - which is being proposed by the Clouds Architecture Office - is designed to be suspended downward on an asteroid orbiting 50,000km from earth. It would orbit in a figure-eight pattern across the northern and southern hemispheres in a 24-hour cycle each day.

A design close-up of the asteroid from which the proposed skyscraper would be suspended using high-strength cables

On its website, the firm notes that ""Analemma inverts the traditional diagram of an earth-based foundation, instead depending on a space-based supporting foundation from which the tower is suspended. ""This system is referred to as the Universal Orbital Support System (UOSS).

""By placing a large asteroid into orbit over earth, a high-strength cable can be lowered towards the service of earth from which a super tall tower can be suspended,"" the website noted. ""Since this new tower typology is suspended in the air, it can be constructed anywhere in the world and transported to its final location.""

The best location to get started, Clouds Architecture noted, is Dubai.

""The proposal calls for Analemma to be constructed over Dubai, which has proven to be a specialist in tall building construction at one-fifth of the cost of New York City construction,"" the designers said.

World's next tallest tower

The initial design - which Clouds Architecture is billing as ""the world's tallest tower"" - includes separate parts of the tower dedicated to business; sleeping quarters; devotional activities; a gardening and agricultural centre; ""transfer stations"" that allow for the transfer of people and goods between the earth's surface and the orbiting structure; and space for dining, shopping and entertainment.

The two highest sections of the tower - starting at between 17,000 and 20,000 metres above earth - are reserved for a reliquary section (which would house religious relics) and a funerary section. The tallest point of the tower above earth is planned for about 32,000 metres above ground.

This is how the Analemma Tower would look from space

To power the building, Analemma's designers plan to instal space-based solar panels, which - ""installed above the dense and diffuse atmosphere"" - would receive constant sunlight. Water is to be filtered and recycled in a semi-closed loop, and re-filled with condensation captured from rain and clouds.

Once built, the tower's proposed orbit would take it in a figure-eight pattern around the world, ""where the tower would move at its slowest speed at the top and bottom of the figure eight, allowing the possibility for the towers occupants to interface with the planet's surface at these points"".

These are the views the different sections in the tower would offer

""The proposed orbit is calibrated so the slowest part of the tower's trajectory occurs over New York City,"" the website adds.

It's definitely not going to be cheap

Cloud Architecture noted that - if the tower ever comes to fruition - it certainly won't be inexpensive.

""Harnessing the power of planetary design thinking, it (the tower) taps into the desire for extreme height, seclusion and constant mobility,"" the website says. ""If the recent boom in residential towers proves that sales price per square foot rises with flood elevation, then Analemma Tower will command record prices, justifying its high cost of construction.""

Heaven on an asteroid

The tower - if and when it is built - will have these sections:

Business quarters

Sleeping quarters

Devotional activities

Gardening and agricultural centre

Transfer stations that allow for the transfer of people and goods between the earth's surface and the orbiting structure

Space for dining, shopping and entertainment

Science-fiction or science-fact?

While an asteroid-suspended skyscraper may seem like an implausible part of a science-fiction movie, Clouds Architecture noted that it may be closer to reality than most people think.

""In 2015, the European Space Agency sparked a new round of investment in asteroid mining concerns by proving with its Rosetta mission that it's possible to rendezvous and land on a spinning comet,"" the firm's website noted. ""NASA has scheduled an asteroid retrieval mission for 2021 which aims to prove the feasibility of capturing and relocating an asteroid.""

The project's designers noted that harsh atmospheric conditions mean that there ""is probably a tangible height limit beyond which people would not tolerate living"".

""For example, while there may be a benefit to having 45 extra minutes of daylight at an elevation of 32,000 meters, the near vacuum and -40°C temperature would prevent people from going outside without a protective suit,"" the website added. ""Then again, astronauts have continually occupied the space station for decades, so perhaps it's not so bad.""

55,55,FL-2017-000046-BGD,"Sports are known for matches, but rarely for how they are used as political expressions - DAWN.com",https://www.dawn.com/news/1323588,"The phenomenon was used in West Indian cricket, but more commonly on the football fields of South American countries.

Recently a minister belonging to one of the island nations which make up the West Indies suggested that the Caribbean people should forget about the declining status of West Indian cricket and concentrate on the other more important things such as commerce and industry.

He added that in the past, West Indian cricket had an important political aim, but since that aim was successfully achieved, there was now no need for cricket to be taken so seriously.

Despite the fact that the minister’s comments sounded harsh, they do contain a very important historical aspect of the region’s cricket.

Rise and fall of West Indian cricket nationalism

The West Indies cricket team is made up of numerous tiny island states in the Caribbean. The populations of these small islands largely consist of people whose ancestors were brought here as slaves from Africa and South Asia by white Western colonialists.

The hold of white overlords remained strong in these islands even when (from the mid-20th century onward) the black and South Asian people of the region were allowed self-rule.

For example, the West Indies gained Test status in the 1920s, but the team did not have a black captain till almost 40 years later! The team’s first black captain was Frank Worrell who was appointed captain in 1960.

Simon Lister in his 2007 book Supercat quotes the most successful West Indian cricket captain, Clive Lloyd (who was made skipper in 1974), as saying that till the early 1970s, ""West Indian players played to please white people"" and that ""black cricketers were seen as something exotic, whose only role was to entertain white audiences.""

But in the 1970s, things were changing on the islands. Left-wing unrest, political turmoil and street violence had gripped the region. These were directly inspired by the emergence of radical ‘Black Power’ groups and civil rights movements in the United States in the 1960s.

Hilary Beckles in her detailed study of West Indian cricket wrote that the West Indian nations had begun to search for an identity that was not shaped by their bygone colonial overlords. The nations were also looking to assert a nationalism based on the black culture, which, over the decades, had developed on the islands.

Political violence became a norm in the West Indies in the 1970s. -- Photo: The Telegraph

Amidst riots, assassinations, collapsing economies and growing animosity between the islands, cricket became the sport which not only managed to instill a sense of racial unity between the islands, but the sport also became an expression of collective West Indian nationalism.

This happened when the West Indies won cricket’s inaugural world cup in 1975, defeating a strong Australian side in the final.

This new expression of the emerging West Indian nationalism was further strengthened when the West Indies toured England in 1976. Amidst racial violence in London and Birmingham, England captain Tony Greig was quoted in the press as saying that he plans to make the West Indians ""grovel."" This was taken as a racist slur by the West Indian squad and it galvanised the players to ""destroy English cricket.""

West Indian batsmen played their shots as if they were physically assaulting English bowlers, and West Indian fast bowlers, especially Michael Holding and Andy Roberts, were given a free hand by Lloyd to aim at the English batsmen’s heads and bodies. The West Indies won the five-Test series 3-0.

During the last Test when England were on their way to losing the game and the series, Tony Grieg stunned the crowd by falling down on his knees and pretending to grovel. He was literally made to eat his own words.

Thus began West Indies ascendancy in world cricket which lasted for almost a decade and a half, during which the team retained its number one ranking in Tests and ODIs till the late 1980s.

Between 1976 and 1988, every game by the West Indies was played as if it was an act of war and the players were psyched to believe that the existence of the West Indian nations banked on how the team performed on the field.

By the early 1990s, the politics and economies of the island nations had greatly stabilised and improved. Ironically, this is when West Indian cricket began to decline. It was as if due to the political and economic improvements on the islands, West Indian cricket lost its purpose and meaning. The besieged mindset that had driven West Indian cricket between 1976 and late 1980s had withered away.

From the early 2000s onward, the once mighty and seemingly invincible cricket side was hovering at the bottom of cricket world rankings. A sad decline which is still in the process of further deterioration.

Goodbye to all that. -- Photo: Daily Telegraph

Football wars

West Indian cricket is a prominent example of how a sport is sometimes used as a political/ideological expression by nation-states. But this phenomenon was more common in football, especially in South American countries.

Again, quite like what happened in the West Indies, South American football too retained an ideological and political dimension during a period of political and economic turmoil.

Joshua Nadel, a professor of history and author of Why Soccer Matters in Latin America, wrote that ""modern Latin American nations and soccer grew and evolved together. Soccer clubs and stadiums acted as spaces where Latin American societies could grapple with the complexities of nationhood, citizenship, politics, gender and race.""

He went on to add that in Brazil football first became a way to iron-out tensions between the country’s Latino and black populations and then to develop a distinctive Brazilian idea of nationhood.

The same happened in various other Latin American countries as well whose football squads developed their own style of playing which was different to the European style. This helped define South American culture in a world (and sport) which was dominated by European ideas.

Brazil witnessed a military coup in 1964. Facing an economic crisis, political chaos and racial polarisation, the military regime began investing heavily in Brazilian football. It constructed 13 new football stadiums and handpicked a manager who could be easily molded to mouth the government’s version of national unity.

The ploy worked when Brazil won the 1970 football world cup. The victory was sweet amidst the continuing economic and political turmoil in Brazil. Predictably, the military regime touted the win as a regenerative expression of Brazilian nationalism and unity.

The trend continued in the 1970s. As sportswriter Jamie Rainbow reminded readers in an excellent 2013 feature in World Soccer, by 1975 the Brazilian football team manager was describing the team as ""an infantry unit.""

Militaristic terms had begun to describe ‘missions’ of Latin American football teams. In fact, an actual war had already taken place between the armies of two South American nations, El Salvador and Honduras, in 1969 over a football match!

In 1976, a military regime came to power in Argentina. The government that the military had toppled had planned to use the holding of the 1978 football world cup in Argentina to revive Argentinean economy, politics and nationalism. The military regime which came to power was brutal and drew condemnation from various European countries.

The dictatorship decided to use the 1978 world cup to cleanse the regime’s tainted reputation. It not only wanted to just host the event but went to great lengths to make sure that Argentina won the cup.

According to a 2012 media report, when the military dictator of Peru sent some political prisoners to Argentina in 1978 to be interrogated by the notorious Argentinean regime, the Argentinean dictator Jorge Videla told his counterpart that he would only agree to take the prisoners if he forced the Peru team to lose to Argentina in a group game.

Argentina needed to defeat Peru by a margin of four goals to eliminate Brazil and go into the finals. That’s exactly what happened. Argentina then went on to defeat Holland in the finals and the victory was hailed by Videla as a triumph of Argentinian nationalism.

But unlike West Indian cricket nationalism of the 1970s and 1980s, the ideological aspect in South American football was more multidimensional. For example, Jamie Rainbow also alludes to the fact that the idea of nationalism held by the opponents of military regimes in Brazil and Argentina also found a voice in the game.

Rainbow wrote that the flamboyant samba style of playing football in Brazil was developed not only as a protest against European style of playing, but also as a protest against the regimented mindset being imposed by dictators.

Ben Cullimore, writing in These Football Times, mentions that before commercialism entirely took over football, most front-line footballers in South America and Europe were socialists because they came from working-class backgrounds.

In 2010, former Liverpool and England footballer Simon Hattenstone told the Guardian that the ‘socialist legacy’ in Latin American football has instilled the kind of collective ethos in South American teams which helps them win more major events than the England team.

Football also became an expression of nationalism in the Netherlands in the 1970s. The Dutch team developed a style of playing called ‘total football’ (totaalvoetbal) - a tactical theory in which any outfield player could take over the role of any other player in a team.

This helped the Dutch to reach the finals of the 1974 World Cup. In the final against Germany, the Dutch employed the tactic to the fullest. In the Netherlands, the game against Germany was seen a chance to seek Netherlands’ revenge against Nazi Germany’s occupation of Holland during World War II. But the tense game was won by Germany.

Dutch and German players embroiled in an argument during the 1974 final.

The nationalist impulse in sports in Pakistan

Former Pakistan batting legend Hanif Mohammad wrote in his book that Pakistan’s first cricket captain, Abdul Hafeez Kardar, would often make patriotic speeches in front of the players and explain to them that playing cricket for Pakistan was much more than a sporting role; it was a national duty of utmost importance.

Pakistan came into being in 1947. It had scarce economic resources and even when its cricket team was handed Test status by the international cricket authorities, its cricket board could not afford to give the players proper playing kits. Hanif wrote that the players were often loaned money by fans so they could buy bats, gloves, pads and shoes.

Kardar was a staunch nationalist and he especially wanted the team to do well against the region’s former colonial rulers England, and also against India from which Pakistan had been acrimoniously carved as a separate country.

During Pakistan’s first-ever Test series in 1952 (against India in India), Kardar asked the cricket board to hand out Pakistan’s national dress – shirvanee – to the players. The government obliged.

But, curiously, when the team was to be photographed with the Indian president in Delhi, they did turn up in shirvanees – except Kardar, who turned up in a tuxedo! No one knows why.

In 1954 when Pakistan defeated England in a Test during its first tour of England, the Pakistan government became alert to the possibility of using cricket as an expression of nationalist fervour. The victory in England was explained as Pakistan’s resilience and the players were hailed as heroes who had ‘overcome the colonial legacy of the region.’

The successful exploits of Kardar’s team continued to draw attention from the government and more resources were invested in the game. In 1958 when Kardar announced his retirement, Prime Minister Feroz Khan Noon and Governor General Iskander Mirza implored him to carry on. But Kardar decided to remain retired.

In late 1958, Ayub Khan came to power through a military coup. He envisioned Pakistan as a country driven by a robust economy and industrialisation and a nationalism built on the precepts of ‘Muslim modernism’, scientific thinking and a strong military.

But after Kardar, Pakistan cricket had fallen by the wayside. It was unable to express Ayub’s idea of vigorous nationalism. This is when hockey seeped through the cracks emerging between cricket and Pakistan’s changing nationalist ethos.

Pakistan hockey had first made its mark by winning the 1958 Asian Games hockey final. But it was the team’s win against India in the hockey final of the 1960 Olympic Games which galvanised hockey in Pakistan and it became the national sport of the country.

Pakistan’s first Olympic hockey gold (1960).

On the other hand, cricket continued to slide. After Pakistan lost 4-0 in a series against England in 1962, the Ayub regime announced that Pakistan was not to play any international cricket until the team upped its standards. Pakistan didn’t play another series till 1964. And again none between 1965 and early 1967. It hardly won a cricket game across the 1960s.

What’s more, some schools in the country, such as Habib School and Cantt Public School in Karachi, debarred students from playing cricket.

Cricket in those days was played by just seven countries. Hockey was a more global sport. Ayub found hockey to be a perfect sporting expression of his idea of progress and nationalism. And unlike South American football or West Indian cricket which would thrive in times of political turmoil, hockey in Pakistan grew during a time of economic growth and political stability (albeit both achieved through authoritarian means).

In 1968, Pakistan won its second Olympic hockey title. Though the Ayub regime which had invested major resources in the game was quick to hail the victory as an expression of the government’s ‘decade of development’, truth was that the regime by was now facing a serious protest movement.

After the 1965 Pakistan-India War, the country’s economy had begun to slide, triggering political turmoil. Ayub resigned in March 1969. By 1971, the country’s armed forces were embroiled in a vicious civil war in its eastern wing (the Bengali-dominated East Pakistan).

In the summer of 1971, some Pakistani cricketers tried to make cricket nationally relevant again. The civil war in East Pakistan had gotten intense when the Pakistan cricket team reached England under the captaincy of Intikhab Alam.

A charity organisation had planned to auction a bat in London, signed by Pakistan and England players. The auction money was then supposed to be handed over to the Red Cross working in East Pakistan during a destructive monsoon there.

Some Pakistan players led by former Marxist-student-leader-turned-cricketer Aftab Gul refused to sign the bat, claiming that the ‘Bengalis were traitors!’ But the government of General Yahya Khan, fearing that this act would be seen by the British press as an exhibition of West Pakistan’s arrogance towards the Bengalis, ordered the team management and the captain to make sure that the players signed the bat. They eventually did. Pakistan lost the series 2-0.

Whereas Gul’s attempt to elevate the nationalist character of Pakistan cricket backfired and the sport in the country continued to sink, hockey once again came forth to achieve a major distinction. Now operating in much more troublesome circumstances (civil war, political turmoil, economic decline), the Pakistan hockey team reached Barcelona in October 1971 to take part in the inaugural Hockey World Cup.

It glided through to the final and beat Spain 1-0 to win the cup. Two months later, East Pakistan broke away and became Bangladesh. Yahya resigned and the chairman of the populist Pakistan People’s Party PPP rose to become the country’s new ruling party.

Under Bhutto and after the East Pakistan debacle, Pakistan’s nationalist narrative began to change. It became more aggressive, mainly driven by illusions of grandeur (pumped in to regenerate a demoralised polity) and a persecution complex which blamed ‘international forces working against Pakistan.’

The nature of the country’s hockey team also changed. Whereas in the 1960s the hockey team was to perform as a reflection and symbol of the Ayub regime’s developmental and modernist nationalist model, the team became more aggressive during the Bhutto regime.

In his autobiography, former Pakistan hockey captain Islauddin wrote that the Pakistan hockey players in the 1970s were trained like soldiers. Passionate patriotic songs were played during training and the players were told that they were the sporting expressions of the country’s post-1971 renewal. The persecution complex which had seeped in the nationalist narrative made its way into the team as well.

For example, after Pakistan lost to Germany in the final of the 1972 hockey Olympic final in Munich, the team management accused the referee of cheating. When the team was being handed their silver medals, the players laughed and casually threw the medals on the ground. No action was taken by the Pakistan government. It too believed the refereeing was flawed.

By the mid-1970s, the Pakistan hockey team had reached the number one spot in hockey world rankings. Just before the hockey final of the 1974 Asian Games in Tehran (between Pakistan and India), PTV ran footage of Pakistani hockey players loudly playing Pakistani nationalist songs so that the songs could be heard by the Indian players who were training nearby. Pakistan won the final 2-0.

In 1976, Pakistan cricket which had been in the doldrums ever since the early 1960s tried to crawl back into contention when Pakistan pulled off a stunning win against Australia in Australia. But it got its best chance yet to make a prominent nationalist statement when in 1978, cricket resumed between Pakistan and India. It had been terminated after the 1965 war.

In July 1977 a reactionary military coup had put General Zia into power. He was facing protests when the Indian cricket team arrived in Pakistan to play three Tests and three ODIs. But months before the series kicked off, the Pakistan hockey team had won its second world cup title, defeating the Netherlands 3-2 in a closely-fought final.

On the team’s return to Pakistan (from Argentina), captain Islauddin and his players were showered with praise by the Zia regime and hockey reached the peak of its popularity in Pakistan. An Astroturf stadium was built in Karachi because international hockey was now to be played on Astroturf.

Months later, cricket rebounded by defeating India 2-0, and the regime declared a holiday to celebrate the win! What’s more, while the Pakistan cricket team was on its way to win a Test against India in Lahore, the hockey team won the inaugural Champions Trophy (also held in Lahore), thus retaining its number one ranking in world hockey.

Cricket had somewhat rebounded as a popular sport, but it continued to play second fiddle to hockey. Ironically, even though Pakistan cricket captain Mushtaq Muhammad had managed to make the board increase the salaries of the players, nothing of the sort happened for the hockey players. They were still being dubbed as ‘soldiers’ who were playing for the country’s national pride rather than money.

Low pay and high nationalist expectations did not halt Pakistan hockey’s continuing rise. It remained to be Pakistan’s most popular sport despite the fact that the Pakistan cricket team scored some major victories in the early 1980s, both under Imran Khan’s captaincy. In 1982-83, it defeated India 3-0 and then swept Australia 3-0.

But the Pakistan hockey team was still the number one-ranked side in the world and by now Pakistan was known in the world (especially in Europe) more for the kind of hockey that it had been producing than anything else. Then, in 1982, the hockey team won its third world cup title.

Thousands of fans, including famous film personalities and ministers, greeted the team at the Lahore Airport when it returned to Pakistan (from India) with the cup. Zia praised the side by also alluding to the ‘Islamisation’ aspect which his regime had added to Pakistan’s post-1971 nationalist narrative. He said that the hockey team had ‘played like mujahids (holy warriors)’. And when he was now thinking of using hockey as a diplomatic tool to ease ties with India, Sharjah happened.

If one was to point out the year from when Pakistan cricket began to overtake hockey as a national sport, it has to be 1986. During a Pakistan-India final in an international cricket tournament in Sharjah in April 1986, India was well-placed to win the game when Pakistan vice-captain and master batsman Javed Miandad played a match-winning innings to help the team grab its first major tournament. Requiring four to win from the last ball of the match, Miandad lifted Indian medium-pacer Cheetan Sharma for a massive six!

The country went wild and Minadad became perhaps Pakistan cricket’s first millionaire! On the other end of 1986, hockey world champions Pakistan were knocked down and out of that year’s Hockey World Cup. In the 12-team-event, Pakistan came 11th. As a consolation, the number two side in the world India came 12th. The great South Asian hockey decline had begun.

In an interview given on a show on PTV, Pakistan’s ace goalkeeper Shahid Ali Khan spilled the beans by informing that hockey players got just Rs26 as daily allowance on tours and less than Rs1,000 per match. He added that whenever the players had asked for a pay raise, they were told that they should be ashamed of themselves for asking money because playing for Pakistan was a ‘selfless national duty.’

Zia now decided to use cricket as a diplomatic tool instead of hockey to better ties with India. He did just that by visiting India to watch a match during Pakistan’s 1987 tour of that country. Pakistan won the Test series 1-0 and the ODI series 5-1.

From the late 1980s onward, Pakistan cricket inherited the nationalist character which the country’s hockey had been carrying ever since the early 1960s. In 1992, the Pakistan cricket team won its first world cup, coming back into the tournament after being almost knocked out.

This win further consolidated cricket’s popularity and national character in Pakistan, even though the hockey team did rebound for a bit by winning its fourth world cup in 1994. But this was Pakistan hockey’s last hurrah. It began to decline rather drastically.

Today, the new generation of Pakistanis have little or no memory or knowledge of what Pakistan hockey was once about. This once giant nationalist-sporting endeavour has simply withered away.

Pakistan cricket’s most recent nationalist endeavour came in 2012 when Misbah-ul-Haq was made captain of a team tainted by scandal and infighting. It reflected the state of the country at the time: polarised, isolated and plagued by terrorism. No foreign team was willing to tour Pakistan. Misbah had to captain all his games abroad.

He gradually repaired the damage and in 2016, when Pakistan won a Test against England at Lords, the team performed push-ups as a salutation to the military men who had given fitness training to the players for the tour. This was Pakistan cricket’s way of acknowledging the shift in the nationalist narrative being shaped by the state and government of Pakistan which now wants to reverse the militaristic narrative instilled in the 1980s.

The push-ups meant that cricket is still well ingrained as the sport which defines Pakistan’s nationalist ethos.

Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis is likely to attend the flag hoisting ceremony on May 1, the foundation day of Maharashtra state, the officer, who recently visited Kolhapur to see the preparation work, said. ""This flag post would be the second tallest in the country,"" the officer said.

A 360-foot high flag post, said to be the country's tallest, was inaugurated on March 6 at the Indo-Pak Attari Border, just a stone's throw from Pakistan. Maharashtra Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil confirmed the development saying all the necessary permissions from the Revenue and Home departments have been obtained for raising the flag post in Kolhapur.

The flag pole is going to be installed at the Police Garden located opposite of Superintendent of Police headquarters. Kolhapur Street Beautification Project (KSBP), a registered trust, will be raising the flag post.

Chandrakant Patil said, ""It's good that Kolhapur will get attention for something positive. The flag post and the Police Garden are being developed by a local trust, hence there is no burden on the state over the task and also its maintenance.""

Sujay Pitre, president of KSBP said, ""The flag will be 90 feet long and 60 feet wide. We have purchased three sets of flag as we can replace immediately if one of them gets damaged. At the base, the tapering flag pole will be five feet wide, while it will be 16 inches at the top. Six flood-lights will illuminate the tricolour through the night. The total weight of the pole will be 24,000 kg.""

The total expenditure incurred for the entire project is Rs 1.1 crore, which the Trust has raised through donations, he said. ""We are also going to install a CCTV camera on top of the Police Headquarters, which will provide a close-up shot of the flag on a TV screen. If anybody notices any damage to the flag, they will have to inform to the Trust staff. We will immediately replace it,"" he said.","Mon, 27 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2017/03/27/560266-548318-432422-national-anthem.jpg,"['kolhapur', 'flag', 'officer', 'pole', 'maharashtras', 'second', 'post', 'trust', 'feet', 'maharashtra', 'wide', 'tallest', 'countrys']",

Arunabh Kumar, the founder and CEO of web entertainment firm 'The Viral Fever' has been summoned by Mumbai Police for his statement in a sexual harassment case.

Arunabh was, on Wednesday, booked under molestation charges by Mumbai police.

The TVF CEO has been accused of allegedly causing sexual harassment to unknown women.

The suburban Andheri police registered a case against Kumar under sections 354 A (causing sexual harassment) and 509 (insult the modesty of a woman by indecent words, gesture or acts) of Indian Penal Code, said DCP Ashwini Sanap, police spokesperson.

Kumar hadn't been arrested, he said, without disclosing on whose complaint the FIR was registered.

Earlier this month, an anonymous blog post by a woman alleging sexual harassment to her by Kumar when she worked at TVF between 2014 and 2016 had gone viral on the social media.

TVF had denied all the allegations and said it would ""leave no stone unturned to find the author of the article and bring them to severe justice for making such false allegations."" TVF was criticised for its ""insensitive"" statement.

The company had claimed that the person, who first levelled allegations against Kumar in a blog post, was never on its payroll.

After some other women came forward with similar allegations, the company admitted that it should have responded in a better manner rather than reacting emotionally and too quickly.

The police had appealed women to come forward and lodge a complaint.

""We appeal that such women should lodge a complaint and strong action will be taken,"" Joint Commissioner of Mumbai Police (Law and Order) Deven Bharti had said.

A lawyer later filed an application with MIDC police station in suburban Andheri referring to accusations of sexual harassment made in the blog post.

Advocate Rizwan Siddqiuee, the lawyer, said a third person can set in motion a criminal case in such matters, so he had approached the police.

Kumar, an IIT graduate, founded TVF in 2011.

Biren Singh called on the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today and discussed a wide range of issues related to several ongoing projects in the State.

The initial one-to-one meeting between the Chief Minister and the DoNER Minister was followed by a joint meeting in which officers from the State Government and the DoNER Ministry also participated. One of the important issues that came up during the discussion was setting up of Sports University near Imphal which was announced by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi nearly two years ago, but had got delayed on account of certain procedural and land acquisition issues on the part of the State Government. It was decided that with the cognizance of the Sports Ministry, the project will soon be put on fast-track.

Dr Jitendra Singh told the Chief Minister that the Ministry of DoNER, through its NLCPR (Non-Lapsable Central Pool of Resources) Fund, will donate Rs.48 crore for fitting flood lights for the Hockey Stadium in Khuman-Lampak Sports Complex.

Dr Jitendra Singh said that the DoNER Ministry will also help the Government of Manipur in the construction of women’s markets in different districts of the State depending on the priority of the State Government. Another proposal was for supporting the setting up of a mini-Secretariat in different districts of Manipur, which can however be taken up later in due course.

The novel idea of starting an “Air-dispensary-cum-ambulance” helicopter service, which was mooted by Dr Jitendra Singh a few months ago, will be carried forward through North-Eastern Council. This will serve as a blessing for people living in remote peripheral areas with little accessibility to healthcare centres. The Air dispensary will have the provision of a Specialist doctor with necessary facilities to hold OPD in different Panchayat areas and also transport the sick patients to the required hospital by the same Chopper.

Dr Jitendra Singh also suggested to Shri Biren Singh to hold a showcasing event in Delhi where the various rich attributes of Manipur, ranging from handicraft to theatre heritage, could be exhibited for the benefit of the rest of the country.","Tue, 28 Mar 2017 16:26:39 GMT",https://i0.wp.com/orissadiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17626384_1951692448385598_5512579145419183362_n.jpg?fit=451%2C240&ssl=1,"['state', 'ministry', 'doner', 'calls', 'issues', 'different', 'manipur', 'n', 'jitendra', 'chief', 'minister', 'singh', 'dr', 'biren', 'cm']",

The legendary musician Bob Dylan will be honoured with Nobel Prize for Literature in Stockholm this weekend and, the good news is that the music baron will finally accept his much-deserved award.

The American singer was awarded the prize in October but failed to travel to pick up the award, or deliver the lecture that is required to receive the $900,000 prize, BBC reported.

The academy said it would meet Dylan, 75, in private in the Swedish capital, where he has two concerts.

He will not lecture in person but is expected to send a taped version, said the report.

If he does not deliver a lecture by June, he will have to forfeit the prize money.

A blog entry from Sara Danius, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, said: ""The good news is that the Swedish Academy and Bob Dylan have decided to meet this weekend.

""The Academy will then hand over Dylan's Nobel diploma and the Nobel medal, and congratulate him on the Nobel Prize in Literature.

""The setting will be small and intimate, and no media will be present; only Bob Dylan and members of the Academy will attend, all according to Dylan's wishes,"" she said.

Earlier this week, Darius said the academy had had no phone conversations with Dylan and that he had until June 10 to deliver the lecture in order to receive the money, reported BBC.

""What he decides to do is his own business,"" she had said.

In October, Bob Dylan became the first songwriter to win the prestigious award, and the first American since novelist Toni Morrison in 1993.

He received the prize ""for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition"", the award citation said.

It took him more than two weeks to make any public comment, finally saying the honour had left him ""speechless"".

He then snubbed the Nobel ceremony in December because of ""pre-existing commitments"".

But in a speech read out on his behalf, he said he had thought his odds of winning were as likely as him ""standing on the moon"".

He said it was ""truly beyond words"" to receive the prize.

Building a new economy

Introduction

In a way, all human history is a history of migration. We have been on the move since we first appeared as a species, pushed out of our comfort zones by war or drought, or pulled toward the horizon by the promise of something better beyond it.

Prior to the outbreak of war in Syria in 2011, the most dramatic migrations of modern times involved armies of the poor trying to cross the Mediterranean into Europe, or wading across the Rio Grande into the United States. In these migrations, the great attractants are economies that offer opportunities to people willing to start at the bottom and do the 3D– work too dirty, difficult or dangerous to appeal to those already there.

South Africa is also a magnet for this sort of migration, although its allure is less obvious. The United States has an unemployment rate of 4.7 percent. Around 96 percent of German adults who want to work are able to do so. SA, on the other hand, is a lower-middle-income country with an official unemployment rate of 27 percent, rising to around 40 percent if you apply the expanded definition. A country that can’t even begin to provide work for all its people. A country where jobs and opportunities are held to be painfully scarce, especially for blacks.

This is at any rate the view of the ruling African National Congress, which believes it is impossible for black South Africans to advance without the assistance of laws forcing whites to hire them or promote them or take them into white-owned businesses as Black Empowerment partners. Since these laws have yet to deliver the desired level of economic equality, the ANC continues to portray South Africa as a society where black ambition is smothered by white racism. “The majority of black people are still economically disempowered,” declared president Jacob Zuma in his 2017 state of the nation address. The solution, he said, was to “move beyond words” by deploying new and even more deadly weapons against white economic domination.

In truth, Zuma’s party has been on this course for 22 years already. During this time, enormous numbers of migrants entered South Africa from elsewhere in Africa and Asia, clearly undeterred by ANC warnings regarding the insuperable odds they faced. They also ignored all the Afro-pessimists who were leaving even as they arrived, muttering about poor governance, economically suicidal government policies and apparently impending economic collapse. On its face, it was almost insane to move to such a country, but they came anyway, dark-skinned people by the million. Where South Africans saw desolation, they saw hope. Where we saw problems, they saw opportunity. They found work where there was none, raised capital even though they had no access to bank loans. They moved into arenas where competition was brutal – the township grocery business, for instance, or informal trading in Johannesburg's inner city -- and beat us at our own game.

Strangest of all, the unemployment rate among these migrants is a fraction of our own. According to the academics who formulated this conclusion, this is “very unusual.” Foreigners arriving in a country where they can’t speak the language and often have no working papers typically struggle to find work. In South Africa, unemployment among foreign migrants is 14.6 percent, roughly half to a third of the local unemployment rate, depending on which definition is applied.

Two years ago, Small Business Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu took a beating in the media for suggesting that foreign migrants should share their business secrets with black South Africans. “Black people were never part of the economy of South Africa in terms of owning anything,” she said, “and therefore when they see other people coming from outside being successful they feel like the space is being closed by foreigners. It’s important for the foreigners to share with the South Africans about what it is that makes it possible for them to be successful.”

This was taken to be xenophobic, and Ms. Zulu was duly savaged. But this report takes the view that she was posing an entirely legitimate question, and that an answer is called for.

This report is therefore dedicated to Ms. Zulu. Based on a survey of the academic literature and interviews with foreign migrants, it seeks to solve the riddle she posed, and in the process winds up questioning some of our most cherished assumptions about ourselves and our society.

Why do they come?

As noted, human migration is driven by both push and pull forces. In South Africa’s case, the chief push factor is war or political repression in four countries (DRC, Somalia, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe) that eject large numbers of refugees in our direction. And the chief pull factor is South Africa’s relatively strong economy. Consider the graph below, which depicts per capita Gross Domestic Product in eight countries that contribute heavily to SA's migrant inflow.

GDP GRAPH

There is of course some interaction between push and pull factors. Somalis and Congolese might be fleeing bullets but at the same time, yearning to live in a country where they can work in peace and earn enough to send money to relatives at home. It’s sometimes hard to distinguish between these two motives, but for now, let’s agree that if you live in a war-torn country, South Africa offers relative safety, and if you live in a very poor one, it looks like a society where life is better for almost everyone, even those at the bottom of the human pyramid. Not that potential migrants study World Bank Tables. All research everywhere show that the greatest of all pull factors for migrants is letters (or these days, emails and cellphone calls) from pioneers whose message to those they left at home is, it’s okay here, there is food and money, come.

How many of them are there?

Nobody knows.

But let’s consider the possibilities. In the apartheid era, SA’s borders were patrolled by soldiers and illegal migration was fairly strictly controlled. Change set in during the post-1990 transition. Borders were demilitarized, and in 1998, parliament passed legislation committing South Africa to granting at least temporary asylum to anyone seeking refuge here.

At the same time, government officials began to exhibit a certain slackness, causing South Africa to become known as a country where border controls were slack and fraudulent identity documents easily obtainable. A trickle of migrants turned into a flood, and by 2003, even the director-general of the Department of Home Affairs was willing to acknowledge that border control had become “a joke.” Planeloads of foreigners were flying into Johannesburg, buying new identities from bent Home Affairs officials and flying on to the UK, where a South African passport enabled visa-free entry.

In recent years, government has made efforts to crack down on this sort of corruption, but we are still struggling to cope with its legacy. Between 2006 and 2015, more than a million asylum seekers entered the country, swelling the number of refugees already present. Unknown numbers of economic migrants simply jumped the borders or overstayed their visas and went underground. In 2011, for instance, around 12 million visitors entered South Africa legally, but only 10.3 million left again. The present whereabouts of those who stayed is unknown.

Do undocumented aliens tell the truth when government officials knock on their doors? In Census 2011, around 1.7 million residents were willing to tell Stats SA enumerators that they were “not South African citizens,” but beyond that the numbers are opaque. In 2015, the New York Times reported that South Africa was host to around five million immigrants, but that was a guess and the newspaper had to withdraw it under pressure from anti-xenophobia activists. Migrant numbers are fraught terrain; low estimates make it easier to dismiss migration’s opponents as small-minded bigots, whereas high ones (the highest on record is 12 million) lend urgency to demands for closed borders and radical immigration reform.

Erring on the side of caution, this report chooses to accept the verdict of Census 2011, even though it is probably an underestimate.

On the other hand, 1.7 million is not an inconsiderable number. Let’s assume for a start that the newcomers are almost all working age adults, because it is in the nature of migrants to leave their aged and their children at home. If that’s the case, they constitute about five percent of SA’s adults aged 20-64. And if we accept the claim that around 86 percent of them are working, they make up around 11 percent of South Africa’s working population, and a much larger percentage of those working in the informal sector, where lack of work permits and ID is no barrier to entry.

Generally, the known facts suggest that SA hosts far more undocumented aliens per capita than rich countries like the UK or Germany, and almost as many as the USA, which naturalizes some 700,000 new citizens a year and hosts an additional 11 million illegal migrants besides. On the other extreme we find China, which is wary of outsiders and unmoved by the plight of refugees. According to The Economist, China, with the second-largest economy on the planet, has only 1,448 naturalized citizens in total, and has to date granted asylum to only 583 refugees. Against this backdrop, it seems to safe to say that the Chinese must regard South Africa as one of the most generous – or most stupid – countries on the planet.

How they come

Crossing continents can be a compelling and dangerous adventure, but some migrants – a minority – do it the easy way, flying into South Africa on tourist visas and simply staying. These include West Africans, Chinese, richer Pakistanis and Bangladeshis. Others come on “facilitated journeys” organized by syndicates who (for a fee ranging from $2,500 to $5,000) will smuggle you from Nairobi to Johannesburg and across all borders between. According to academic researchers, around one in five of those using this route will be harmed in some way before their journey is done – robbed or raped by bandits, extorted by police or border officials, held prisoner on arrival by traffickers who compel friends or relatives to cough up a ransom to secure your release.

Those too poor to afford the services of organized traffickers take busses to the South African frontier and walk around border posts under cover of darkness. If they run into a police or army patrol, it is often but not always possible to bribe their way out of trouble. Studies of the Beit Bridge border post reveal that the cheapest of all smuggling rackets in that area is run by police who charge R100 a head to get undocumented migrants across the frontier. On the other hand, some cops see it as their patriotic duty to turn back the incoming tide, even if that means denying genuine refugees their right to enter. If you’re lucky enough to escape their attention, you trek through the bush to the nearest transport route and resume your onward journey.

And so you come to Johannesburg, a city circled by townships and squatter camps where unemployment is astronomical. Without a work permit, your chances of getting what trade unions call “decent work” – a job with a salary, medical benefits and a pension -- are less than zero. Day labour gigs are a possibility, but there are throngs of unemployed artisans and labourers sitting outside every hardware emporium, waiting to be hired. There’s a beggar at every traffic light, and every suburban supermarket has a notice board festooned with bits of paper in which Malawians and Zimbabweans beg for work as gardeners or domestics.

So what do you do?

“The people’s love for each other is limitless.”

That’s a quote from an Ethiopian named Haile, who arrived in Johannesburg on New Year’s Eve 2003 and felt that the fireworks in the sky were there to welcome him. Haile was a political refugee, at odds with his country’s secret police, who suspected him of harbouring sympathies for an insurrectionary movement that was seeking to overthrow the ruling party of Miles Zenawi. Haile worked in a bank at home. He wore a collar and tie, spoke fairly good English. Police threw him in jail and tortured him. Fearing that he might be killed, Haile’s father sold his business and bribed prison guards to set his son free. Haile wound up on the back of a truck laden with livestock, wallowing in cow dung as he was smuggled over the border into Kenya, from where he joined a “facilitated” caravan heading south.

Most of the countries he crossed en route to South Africa are host to communities of migrant traders from elsewhere in Africa or Asia. Refugees could halt their journeys anywhere along the line if they chose to do so, but Kenya, Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania offer few economic opportunities and little hope of realizing what might be your real aim, which is to get into Europe or North America. SA, on the other hand, is at least halfway part of the great Global North. United Nations agencies have offices here, and Pretoria is full of rich-country diplomats who might give you a sympathetic hearing.

So Haile, like millions of others, crawled under the border fence and pushed on towards Johannesburg. He was hugely impressed by his first sight of South African skyscrapers and infrastructure. “I admired the road,” he says. “Passing many tollgates. I thought I am in Europe or somewhere. I was happy and dreaming big as well.”

One of Haile’s travelling companions had an uncle who lived in Little Ethiopia, an enclave of dense ethnocentricity in downtown Johannesburg. There was Ethiopian music in the air as Haile arrived, and almost everyone on streets on New Year’s Eve was speaking Amharic, his mother tongue. “For the first time since I was detained, I felt safe and free,” he says. “I cried.” And so, by his account, did many others. “When people heard my story, they cried. Strangers gave me money. Others let me use their phones to call my family to say I am safe, or offered to help me find work or a place to stay. The people’s love for each other is limitless.”

Within days, Haile had a bed in a room shared with five fellow Ethiopians and a job of sorts with a man who imported material from China and turned it into curtains. “This is how our people do it,” he says. “The one who has already established a business here, he helps the other one.” The work was called “location,” and the pay was zero. Every morning, his benefactor would give him some curtains on credit, and he’d set forth into the townships on foot, selling door-to-door. “It was hard,” he says. “Some days I would make R50 commission. Some days nothing. A lot of days, nothing. But what could I do? You have to pay rent. You have to live. You have to be successful.”

On several occasions, Haile was robbed of his takings, but he paid his benefactor anyway, because that was correct form for a person in his position. It was also important to show commitment and ambition, and his college business diploma helped in this regard. “One day I had a big idea,” he says. “I realised that our model for the curtain business was not good. Often we were only making enough to cover transport. I said we should try something else.” The new plan entailed concentrating sales efforts on salaried civil servants. Haile obtained permission to sell to teachers during their lunch breaks, and to the staff at township clinics. “We got many new clients,” he says “Everyone was happy, and I began to go up.”

Almost all migrant stories begin this way. Pilgrims come from far away, lured by reports of freedom, safety and opportunity in South Africa. Once here, they fall into the warm embrace of what academics call social networks -- family, friends of the family, people from your home town, members of your own tribe or clan, and sometimes, just countrymen. Ethiopians help each other. Nigerians, Zimbabweans and Somalis likewise. Your people feed you and house you, give you a chance to prove yourself.

Not all pass the test. Some steal. Some are lazy. And some are fractured by the stress of their new situation. A recent study found that asylum-seekers in Haile’s position visited Home Affairs’ refugee reception offices six times before being granted the coveted A4 piece of paper known as a temporary refugee permit. As Haile says, first you go during office hours, but the queue stretches around the block and the office closes before you get in. So next time you sleep on the pavement outside so you’re at the front of the queue in the morning, but then it turns out that you lack some important piece of evidence, an oversight that might be overlooked if you’re willing to part with a sweetener.

South Africa’s refugee reception centres are notoriously corrupt. According to Amir Sheik, chairman of the Somali Community Board of South Africa, everyone from the security guard at the gate to senior officials is on the take. “You can put this on the record,” he says. “I am willing to say it in front of the president: corruption is the only language at Home Affairs.” Those who have money get their paperwork processed. Those who don’t must wait. Some of those at the back of the line lose it and fall apart. Without papers, their lives degenerate into a nerve-wracking cat-and-mouse game with law enforcement. Their jobs are typically ill-paid, their living conditions miserable. They start drinking, get depressed, give up. At this point the loving community might turn cold and suggest they admit defeat and go home.

This is an important point. Not all refugees and migrants succeed. But most do. That’s probably because migration is a great Darwinian selector. Throughout history, it has been the best and brightest, the toughest, who hit the road in search of something better. Such people are not easily deterred, especially if they come from hell-holes like the DRC, Somalia or Zimbabwe. Or in Haile’s case, Ethiopia, where authoritarian rulers deal ruthlessly with dissent. Haile had no choice; he could not go home. He had to make it, and eventually, he did.

And now, thirteen years later, he’s sitting in a Rosebank café, wearing smart casuals and speaking perfect English, talking about his company car, his upmarket flat, his two children in Model C schools and the “decent job” into which he eventually clawed himself. All migrant stories are different, but they all begin with a bow to the social networks that embrace you on arrival and hold your hand until you find your feet, so to speak. What comes next is the most interesting part of the migrant story.

Case Study 1 – the foreign takeover of SA’s township grocery trade.

The term spaza (Zulu slang for “camouflagued” or “hidden”) is a throwback to the era when black South Africans struggled to get business licenses, forcing survivalist entrepreneurs to open small shops inside their homes, where they were invisible to passing policemen and municipal inspectors. As apartheid collapsed, these secret shops came out into the open. Some became holes in walls through which the owner sold sweets, cigarettes and a small range of daily necessities. Others evolved into real shops, with counters and shelves stocked with groceries, toothpaste and disposable nappies. By 1990, there was at least one spaza on every township street, typically serving a cluster of around 85 households.

That snippet of information comes from GG Alcock, author of the best-selling Kasinomics. A white boy who grew up in a mud house in the old kwaZulu Bantustan, Alcock earns his living by explaining the workings of SA’s informal sector to corporations that lack his language skills and ability to cross cultural barriers. He notes that first-generation spaza shops had several unique characteristics. Owners and customers knew each other, and if you needed an aspirin in the dead of night, the spaza would open for you. On the other hand, you’d pay a premium for convenience, because spazas were expensive. Prices were 30 to 40 percent higher than in suburban supermarkets, but you needed taxi fare to get there, and that made shopping outside expensive too. So spazas survived and prospered.

Among the forces that protected them was the township’s reputation for lawlessness. South Africa’s retail chains kept their distance, believing they’d be robbed or looted if they set up shop in places like Soweto. But as SA recovered from its turbulent transition, retailers reconsidered. Crime rates were declining. The black middle class was growing exponentially, and there was talk of instituting social grants for the poorest poor. According to Andrew Plastow, who manages a tinned-fish brand for the Oceana group, retail chains took to poring over satellite photographs of South African townships, counting cars and satellite dishes and trying to calculate residents’ collective spending power. They soon realized that what Plastow calls a “post-apartheid windfall” awaited them in black residential areas.

“When I moved to Johannesburg in 1993, there was just three supermarkets in Soweto,” says GG Alcock, the aforementioned informal sector economics guru. “Fifteen years later, there were supermarkets everywhere – Shoprite, U-Save, Pick’n’Pay, Boxer, Pick’n’Pay Family Stores, even Woolworths. Everyone in Soweto lived within three to five kilos of a supermarket.”

Similar changes took place across South Africa, and were welcomed as a sign that townships were transforming from labour barracks into liveable suburbs and cities. Spaza owners were less enthusiastic, because the gleaming new retail emporia offered a cornucopia of consumer goods at prices they had no hope of matching. Some spazas scaled down into cigarette kiosks. Others closed down entirely. “Driving around kasi you’d see boarded-up spazas and fading Coke signs everywhere,” says Alcock. “The small guys couldn’t compete and they were dying. I was one of those who thought the spaza shop was history. Boy, was I mistaken.”

Like almost everyone else, Alcock missed the start of a counter-trend whose origins are shrouded in mystery. All that is clear is that some enterprising foreigner must have seen an opportunity that was invisible to locals and offered to rent one of the dying spazas and see if he could make a go of it. When he succeeded, other foreigners followed suit. Most were Somalis, but Ethiopians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis also entered the game.

Under foreign management, many spaza shops were tarted up with a coat of paint and glass-fronted fridges, and their once-bare shelves suddenly sported a much broader array of brand-name consumer products. Alcock says he noticed this trend when it first manifested, but then came the anti-foreigner pogroms of 2008, which claimed the lives of 70 traders and saw thousands of foreign-owned spazas looted and burned across the country.

Again, Alcock thought the spaza was dead. Again, he was wrong. The foreigners returned to their gutted shops, repaired and restocked them and started again. By 2013, there were roughly 50,000 foreign-run spazas nationwide, and Alcock was convinced he was witnessing the start of a retail revolution. “Everyone was vaguely aware that the foreigners were moving in,” he says, “but they didn’t believe the scale of it. When I was pitching for business, I’d show a slide of a Pakistani trader smiling from behind his spaza counter and say, ‘This is the new face of South Africa’s retail grocery trade.’ The big business guys would say, ‘Hmm, very interesting,’ but I could tell they were skeptical.”

The big business guys had reason. It was totally inconceivable that shabby foreigners with no access to capital could stand up against the collective might of Shoprite, Woolworths and Pick/n/Pay. These giant corporations are famous for grinding brutal discounts out of farmers, food processors and mall landlords. They buy goods by the hundreds of tons and use satellites, cranes and fleets of articulated trucks to move them from factory to market. Shoprite alone employs 138,000 people in fifteen countries and turns over R65 billion a year, achieving economies of scale a Pakistani shopkeeper could only dream of.

Fast forward to early 2016, and Alcock suddenly finds himself being summoned to meetings with Unilever, the world’s third largest manufacturer of food products, soaps, toothpaste and shampoo. “They’d noticed something funny,” he says. “A flattening of their sales through conventional retailers like Shoprite, and at the same time, a steady rise in sales through wholesalers located near townships. So they came to me and said, ‘GG, that shit you’ve been talking about re foreigners, is it for real?’ And I was able to say, yes guys. And then I took a senior Unilever executive into the townships to see for himself. His eyes nearly popped out of his head.”

Alcock whips out his laptop and runs a PowerPoint presentation that lays out the basic facts. There are about 100,000 spaza shops of various sorts in South African townships, he says, ranging from tiny holes in the wall to fancy joints that he calls spazarettes. Once upon a time, they were all locally owned. By 2013, half had been taken over by foreigners. That surged to 70 percent in 2015, and by now, he says, it’s probably 80 percent. “A hole in the wall spaza turns over around R25,000 a month,” he says. “Spazarettes are actually mini-supermarkets, and there around 25,000 of those, each turning between R80,000 and R200,000 a month. I can’t provide exact numbers, but that’s a collective turnover of two to six billion a month for spazarettes alone, and it’s growing.”

According to Alcock, foreigners are also moving upstream into territory dominated by giant wholesalers like Cambridge Foods and Masscash. “I have a database of three hundred mid-sized foreign-owned wholesalers,” he says, all located inside townships, whereas mainstream wholesalers prefer to lurk on the fringes. “They’re popping up everywhere,” he says. “Right now, we’re studying a cluster of 12 Somali-owned midi-wholesalers in Shoshanguve. Our research shows that they’re turning over six to 15 million a month apiece, and they’re growing too. Mark my words, this is the future of retail – the foreigners collectively. If I was Shoprite or Masscash, I’d be shitting myself. ”

Alcock is a man of volcanic enthusiasms, so let’s forgive his colourful language and try to come to grips with what he’s saying. The 80,000-odd shopkeepers he’s looking at generally arrived in South Africa as penniless migrants. Around 50 percent of them are Somalis who fled their war-ravaged country with just the clothes on their back and a few rumpled dollars hidden in their underpants. The rest come from Ethiopia, where per capita income is one-twelfth of South Africa’s, or from poverty-stricken Pakistan and Bangladesh. Many have refugee papers, but the vast majority find that banks still refuse to open accounts for them, and loans are of course out of the question. The South African government offers start-up capital to small-scale entrepreneurs, but that avenue is closed to foreigners too. On top of all that, most could not speak English or any African language when they first arrived, and all were handicapped by the dark skin that supposedly makes black advancement impossible.

Against this backdrop, it was theoretically almost impossible for them to progress – especially if you consider the nature of their opposition. “Everyone blames the foreigners for killing off the South African-owned spaza shop,” says Alcock. “That’s bullshit. The damage was done long before they moved in, and it was done by the retail chains. And it’s those retail chains whose domination is now under threat.”

In 2013, Elizabeth Thabethe, deputy minister of Trade and Industry, paid a visit to the small town of White River, where she spotted a trend that disturbed her somewhat. “You still find some spaza shops with African names,” she said, “but when you go inside to buy, you find your Mohammeds, and most of them aren’t even registered.” Thabethe was duly pilloried for this racist generalization, but as is sometimes the case, a stereotype embodied a potentially important truth. Ethiopians generally adhere to Orthodox Christianity, but Somalis, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis are the dominant force in the spaza revolution, and they all come from strong Islamic cultures. What’s more, as we shall shortly see, religion plays a not inconsiderable role in their success.

So then – how did they achieve the apparently impossible?

Immigrant traders generate their own start-up capital. Newcomers entering the various social networks start at the bottom, working for little or nothing in someone else’s spaza until they prove themselves, at which point they’ll be granted a share of the profits or be invited to join a partnership that typically runs several spaza stores. “A Somali won’t work for years for peanuts,” says Amir Sheik, a Somali community activist. “If I am loyal then you must give me a share so that my own situation will grow.”

Immigrant traders are thrifty. They sleep and eat in the back of their shops, cutting overheads to the bone, and save every cent until they’re positioned to enter a partnership

Immigrant traders are ethnocentric and almost never include outsiders in their partnerships, a factor which enables them to pool resources (including cash savings) and form formidable joint ventures along lines that are simultaneously national, tribal and religious. This is particularly true of Somalis, who have (according to one interesting study) replicated Somalia’s ancient clan structure on South African soil. Partnership deals are verbal, and based entirely on trust. Partners are always from your own extended family or clan. Clan elders oversee negotiations and settle disagreements in a “fair, peaceful and respectable manner.” As one of the subjects in the aforementioned study puts it, “This is the way of our people. Family people from the same clan trust and love each other.”

Immigrant traders work hard. They rise before dawn to sweep their shops and restock their shelves, open their doors at six or seven, and stay open for at least 14 hours, seven days a week. This alone gives them a significant advantage over locals, some of whom like to booze after sundown or go to church on Sundays. According to the calculations of one academic, the foreigners’ brutal work schedule boosts trading hours by 12.5 percent, the equivalent of an extra month’s business every year.

Immigrant traders offer excellent value for money. “These guys have amazing intelligence networks,” says Alcock. “They’re on their cellphones all day, sharing information about what’s on special at the wholesalers. When they spot something interesting, they call their buddies, hire a bakkie and race off to buy a load of it.”

They also keep a close eye on competitors’ prices and strive at all times to match or undercut them by slashing profit margins. According to Alcock, their margins fall as low as 2 percent on some fast-moving items. In this manner, they provide township residents with great value for money. Locally-owned spazas were up to forty percent more expensive than mainstream retailers. Now that the foreigners have taken over, the spaza often undercuts the supermarket. One of Alcock’s PowerPoint slides claims that “shopping at an informal retailer saves the consumer between three and nine percent on the cost of a basket of goods bought at a Shoprite in Naledi Soweto. Savings increase to 5 to 11 percent if the cost of a taxi to and from the supermarket is factored in.”

Sceptical of this claim, we did some comparison shopping of our own, and lo: a can of Koo baked beans that cost R9.80 at a suburban Checkers was R1 cheaper at a Somali outlet in Soweto. A six-pack of Parmalat long-life milk was R80 in the suburbs, vs R73 in Soweto. A six-pack of Powerade cost R60 vs R50.

Immigrant traders provide convenience. As Alcock says, the cost of transport is a painful factor in the lives of the township poor. Supermarkets are typically three to five kilos away, while the spaza is mostly literally on your doorstep. So why spend money on taxi fares or walk long distances when you can stroll over the road and buy the same branded goods at a competitive price from a foreign-run spaza?

Immigrant traders give credit. In the old days, local spaza owners would often give credit too, but according to Alcock, they’d charge loan-shark interest rates. This practice is forbidden in Islam, and since most of the new class of spaza operators are Muslims, they cannot engage in it. They often circumvent the problem by charging no interest at all. In other words, they make a shrewd assessment of their customers’ reliability, and then extend free credit to those who seem likely to repay. According to Alcock, this excludes males wanting to buy cigarettes or cool drinks. But grannies with pensions and mums with social grants are deemed worth the risk, especially if they’re shopping for basic foodstuffs. As Alcock says, people who go hungry if they can’t get credit are unlikely to stiff their friendly Muslim shopkeeper when their grants come in, because he’s their only hope when times are tough again.

Immigrant traders are brave. They come to South Africa to make money, not friends. They go into the townships as outsiders; their presence is often resented and their vulnerability compounded by their inability open bank accounts, which forces them to stash cash in the mattress and carry large amounts of it when they go to restock. This makes them obvious targets for bandits. South African newspapers cover outbreaks of xenophobia and the attendant looting and burning of foreign-owned shops. But they don’t cover the daily war of attrition. According to Amir Sheik of the Somali Community Board, there are some 70,000 Somalis in this country. In the average year, around 100 of them die in armed robberies, he says. This translates into a murder rate of 140/100,000 – more than four times the South African average, and one of the highest murder rates ever measured. Some lose their nerve and go home, or try to find business opportunities outside the townships. But most stick it out. Ask why and they say, “Have you ever been to Mogadishu? If you’d been to Mogadishu you wouldn’t ask that question.”

And finally, some immigrant traders bend the rules. In Cape Town, a study revealed the existence of a network of Somali “agents” who distribute goods that sometimes include untaxed black market cigarettes, a hot-selling commodity in poor areas. In some cases, these goodies are withheld from South African-owned stores and those belonging to rival clans from back home. The IRR was also told that foreigners sometimes collude to lower prices in a given area, only to raise them again once they’ve driven local competitors out of business. For the most part, though, they succeed because of their adherence to the old-fashioned virtues of thrift, hard work, discipline and sobriety.

In the interest of fairness, we ran this potentially controversial conclusion past Mr. D, a thoughtful Soweto businessman who started out in the taxi business but quit circa 2001 because the violence unsettled him. Having sold both his Zolas, he invested in a street-corner shop, opened a spaza and made a success of it, providing his family with a good living and his children with university educations. “I know this business and I work hard,” he says. “I am here all day, fetching and carrying for my customers. How many kilometers you think I walk every day?”

When immigrant traders first made their appearance in his area, Mr. D noticed that they were spying on him, at least to the extent of monitoring his prices, so he started spying back and making sure he stayed competitive. After years of this, he believes he has come to understand their business secrets.

“Their big advantage is actually their religion,” he says. “They can have ten shops and use those Muslim people as staff and know they will abide by their Koran. Not stealing and so on. If I had the same kind of dedicated people I would have 10 shops by now.”

“Our biggest problem,” he continues, “is that we can’t trust our own people. If I leave my workers here for an hour I know they are going to steal something. I know! And our people don’t just steal, they loot the place.” He laughs ruefully, warming to the theme. “When I first started I trusted people,” he says. “Then one day I found something missing and the way it was done made me think it’s not the first time. I knew where these employees were renting so I went there. The landlord said, ‘Oh it’s you, I can’t believe you still have a shop!’ Then he let me inside and I saw their place was full, full of my stuff.” After several similar experiences, Mr. D decided enough was enough. These days, like his foreign rivals, he is extremely reluctant to hire anyone who does not share his bloodline.

Mr. D is convinced that immigrant traders collude amongst themselves to set prices, but otherwise, he’s grudgingly respectful of them. “They know how to run a business,” he says. “ They can keep their prices low because they have low expenses. And they don’t have extended families here, so they can save lots of money.” Mr. D goes on to complain about the so-called “black tax” – extended family obligations that make it hard for him to accumulate cash and capital at the rate immigrant traders do. “With local black people, if one guy is a success, he is supposed to take care of everybody. This is our culture of ubuntu. It’s nice to hear but it doesn’t help the businessman.”

Some years ago, foreigners started approaching Mr. D with lucrative offers for his premises. He said, wait a while. First, he got himself a liquor license. Then he hired a Mozambican contractor to add a second storey to his premises (rooms for rent) and at the same time divide his shop in three. “Then I said to the foreigners, come, I am ready.” Some Bangladeshis took over his spaza operation, paying an undisclosed amount for his stock and goodwill and signing a lease that left him with a nice monthly income. They were also eager, as he’d anticipated, to rent his upstairs rooms, and he still has his liquor store and a tiny space where he sells hardware. So he’s sitting pretty. In fact, he’s doing so well that he recently bought a second small shopping complex, where he’s planning to make a similar arrangement.

There are scores of thousands of South Africans in Mr. D’s position, drawing rents ranging from R1500 to R8000 a month while foreigners tend the spaza. Both sides seem satisfied with this outcome. Locals who were struggling to compete get an income off what was once a dying business, and the foreigners somehow make headway too. We found an anecdote in the literature involving a Somali who dropped his R10,000 cash savings into a one-third share of a spaza located in a container in Delft, outside Cape Town. They paid R4,000 rent a month to the landowner, but worked and saved obsessively, as immigrant traders do. After six months, they began to lose their nerve (lots of robberies and xenophobic mutterings in the area) and decided to sell and move on. This particular Somali cashed out with R44,000 – a 350 percent return on his investment in just six months.

That yarn comes from an excellent MA thesis by UWC student Rory Leiden, who was in exactly the right place at the right time. When he started his research in 2011, the spaza trade in Delft was evenly divided between South Africans and foreigners. By the time he finished a year later, the foreigners’ market share had soared to 80 percent, and the South Africans were crying. Most academics who study migration are human rights enthusiasts, inclined to ascribe any resistance to foreigners to xenophobia. Leiden is more even-handed. He listened to the South Africans’ side of the story, and reported it fairly. Most of his SA subjects were working class people whose large households were entirely dependent on the income generated by their spaza. They were not stupid or lazy or afraid of work. They just couldn’t compete with people who worked around the clock and slashed their overheads to almost nothing by sleeping, eating and bathing in their shops. Some closed down, but most wound up taking Mr. D’s way out -- they surrendered their shops to the foreigners, and settled for the rental.

Mr. D is a patriot. He does not whole-heartedly welcome the foreign invasion. In fact, he uses the term “revolt” to describe Soweto’s periodic outbreaks of anti-foreigner violence, implying a measure of solidarity with those involved. But he does not accuse the foreigners of stealing jobs or engaging in foul play, and acknowledges that they provide a valuable service. On the morning after a riot, he says, Sowetans wake up hungry and realize they’ve shot themselves in the metaphoric foot. With all the foreign-owned spazas looted or shut down, they have to trek to supermarkets to buy their next meal, and that hurts, considering that supermarket prices are often higher and that you have to fork out taxi fare to get there. When the foreigners reopen, their clients return, and business continues as usual.

And the moral of the story? Mr. D scraches his head. He thinks the foreign invasion is good for South Africa only in the sense that it should “wake locals up” and teach them to compete. In theory, this should be fairly easy. South African spaza owners have substantial competitive advantages over their Somali counterparts, given that they do not have to pay rent and are exempt from attack by xenophobic looters. But as yet there is no sign of a South African comeback.

“For a long time, I was the only local who survived in this area,” says Mr. D. “These days, I think it must be about 90 percent foreign ownership in the spaza business. I can say this because when I go to the wholesaler, it is very busy, but I almost never see another local buying there.”

Case Study 2 – the Zimbabwean takeover of Joburg’s restaurant work.

For migrants into Europe and North America, restaurants are an important port of entry into the mainstream economy. Restaurants tend to be small family-owned businesses, typically with fewer than 10 employees, and the work they offer is invariably “precarious,” in the academic phrase, with low wages, no benefits and low barriers to entry.

A similar situation exists in South Africa, where the so-called hospitality industry (including hotels) employs more than half a million workers. It’s impossible to say what proportion of these are migrants, but in Johannesburg, the popular perception is that most restaurant jobs are now in foreign hands.

One recent morning, I found myself sitting at an open-air restaurant table, discussing this with two young white restaurant owners, let’s call them Tom and Jerry. The waiter who serves our cappuccinos is a Zimbabwean, and when I ask, it turns out that the chef is Zimbabwean too, as are most of those chopping vegetables and washing dishes behind the scenes. I say, “What’s going on here? In the l980s, waiters in a joint like this would have been mostly young whites. Chefs too. What happened to them?” Tom shrugs. “In the l980s, Zimbabwe was thriving,” he says. “Now every second Zimbabwean lives here and works in the restaurant trade.”

That’s not entirely true. In 2013, a widely circulated news report claimed that “two to three million” Zimbabweans had fled to South Africa to escape the dire consequences of Robert Mugabe’s land reform and indigenization schemes. Like all migrant numbers, that one was hotly disputed, and Africa Check’s attempts to provide a more reliable figure ran afoul of “scanty, skewed and patchy” government data. All that is clear is that there are large numbers of Zimbabweans here, and that they have somehow acquired a near-monopoly on restaurant work in Johannesburg.

How did this happen? As previously noted, all migration stories follow a similar trajectory. In this case, Zimbabwe is reduced to penury by suicidal economic policies, and young adults come to face a stark choice: starve or head for South Africa. So they crawl under a border fence, like Haile and millions of others, or enter as tourists and disappear into South African cities, where they are embraced by Zimbabwean social networks. Everybody shows some love to newcomers and shares survival tips with them. In the last decade, a lot of those tips have concerned jobs in the restaurant trade.

“It works like this,” says Tom. “The other day, a vacancy opened up in one of my operations, and I put an ad on Facebook saying, ‘Kitchen staff required,’ or whatever. But soon as word got out, a Zimbabwean already working for me said, listen, I have some cousins who are looking for work, can they come for an interview? I said, cool, but if I hire them, you put your name on it; if they cock up, you cock up too. The cousins came and aced the interview, and now I’ve got two more Zimbabweans on the payroll.”

Tom’s buddy Jerry, who runs a restaurant in Braamfontein, concurs. “Zimbabweans come across as confident and well-spoken, and that’s what you need if you’re dealing with the public.” He notes that Zimbabweans are often better educated than South African applicants, and that some are ex-teachers or white-collar workers, taking jobs below their accustomed station. Tom says, “I had a Zimbabwean with a BSc applying for a job the other day. It’s frightening how many Zimbabweans are over-qualified for this kind of work.”

But as he says, Zimbabweans are fleeing a country where the unemployment rate is north of 90 percent, so they have no choice. “The Zimbabweans working for me are men, not boys,” he says. “They have families to support at home. They’re desperate.”

In that case, I say, can you get away with underpaying them?

The restaurateurs sigh. Jerry concedes that his scullers earn less than the minimum wage. Tom says he has a youngster chopping potatoes for R750 a week. “A young South African would never work for that,” he says. Both men concede that they count themselves extremely fortunate to have competent Zimbabwean chefs willing to work for around R6000 a month. But when it comes to waiters, international conventions apply; wages are miniscule, and most earnings come in the form of tips. “My top waitress makes ten grand a month,” says Tom. “Mine makes twenty,” says Jerry.

That’s a substantial income, considering that most of it takes the form of untaxed cash. Aren’t South Africans willing to work for that kind of money? Even white South Africans?

Jerry says, “I hired a white bartender the other day. He lasted two weeks.” Jerry says, “I don’t hire whites at all anymore.” They’re prima donnas, he says. Only want to work lucrative weekend shifts, when tables are full and tips are high. “This causes enormous resentment among my permanent staff – people who’re committed to me. I’d rather give the weekend shifts to them, to cement their loyalty.”

As for black South Africans, both men deny harboring any bias, and both have some locals on their staff. It’s just that the formidable Zimbabwe social network keeps delivering likeable and competent Zimbabwean job candidates to their doorsteps. I say, come on, there’s more to it than that, and Jerry concedes that this is partly the case. “I just want to hire someone who takes the job seriously and does what he says he’ll do. Zim guys are like that. They’re reliable, hard-working and don’t expect me to uplift them. It’s a more professional, more equal relationship than with black South Africans.”

So what happens if all Zimbabweans are expelled? My hosts reply as one: “Joburg’s restaurant industry collapses.”

Next time you’re in a Johannesburg restaurant, ask the owner about the prevalence of Zimbabweans in his or her operation, and you’ll hear some variant of this theme. One restaurateer said he started with one Zimbabwean twenty years ago and now employs 58, almost all members of the same extended family. Others will tell you that they feel a moral obligation to help Mugabe’s victims, and a handful will say they prefer Zimbabweans because South Africans are spoiled, lazy and dishonest. But most cite the social network and its magical ability to conjure up ideal employees at a few hours’ notice.

Stories from the workers’ side of the restaurant trade also follow a familiar trajectory, so I’ll just tell one here. I met Emily in a Melville restaurant where she was slinging pizzas and beer. When she took a break I asked her to tell her story. It began, like many Zimbabwean stories do, in 2005, when inflation began its dizzying acceleration (it was 586 percent in 2005, rising four years later to 79.6 billion percent per annum).

“Everything began to collapse,” Emily says. “My father was working for government but there were months when he didn’t get anything. There were no jobs for me. There came a time when we were eating one meal a day and going to bed hungry. I had no choice. I came to South Africa.”

After jumping the border, she fell in with three friends who were sharing a single room in the inner city, paying R325 a month apiece. For once, the social network failed, and she wound up walking the streets looking for work. She found some in China City, the Chinese mall on the west side of downtown. “I had to get up in the dark to walk there,” she says. “The hours were long, and the pay was R40 a day, but I considered myself lucky. Even with that small money, I could pay rent and send money home to my parents.”

All we need to take from Emily is that one telling phrase -- – “the pay was R40 a day, but I considered myself lucky.” Life is hard and there is much to be said about exploitation and injustice, but meanwhile, let’s just observe that you’re unlikely to hear a South African saying such a thing, and that it tells us almost all we need to know about Zimbabwean domination of Johannesburg restaurant jobs: Robert Mugabe has created a nation that is immune to self-pity; his people have to do whatever is necessary to survive, and they accept this with an extraordinary combination of resignation and cheerfulness.

That attitude can take you places. After a few months of hard labour in China City, Emily moved on to a dishwashing job at an Indian restaurant (R50 a day) and thence to greater things, and finally to her present position at a fashionable Melville eatery. Almost all the other waiters here are Zimbabweans too, and yes, they tipped her off about the vacancy.

Case Study 3 – Rise of the Chaos Precinct

In my distant Joburg childhood, I dreaded being taken to the eastern end of Jeppe Street in downtown Johannesburg. The buildings were tall (four to twenty storeys) and their tenants were dentists, doctors and medical specialists. Dr. Mulder, our dentist, had his drills and other torture implements in a building called Medical Centre. Surrounding skyscrapers had names like Lister Building or Medical Arts, and the streets at their feet were pristine, kept clear of hawkers and other social menaces by strict enforcement of municipal by-laws.

In the 1960s, owning a building in this precinct conferred significant social prestige on a landlord. Doctors were blue-chip tenants; rents were extraordinarily high; at 5pm, fleets of Jaguars and Bentleys would emerge from underground parking lots and head north towards the mink and manure belt.

In the l970s, however, some ill-considered urban planning decisions diverted new development to Rosebank and Sandton, and soon after, apartheid began its long and painful collapse. Poor people started moving into the inner city in defiance of the Group Areas Act. The doctors fled. Unable to find suitable replacements, landlords started renting to blacks, some of whom found themselves at the mercy of rack-renters who failed to unblock the drains, fix the lifts or replace broken light-bulbs. This led to tenant rebellions and the allied phenomenon of building hijacking, in which warlords would see legitimate owners off the premises at gunpoint and divert rental revenues into their own pockets.

After that, says Paul Jackson, one of the unsung heroes of downtown regeneration, inner-city property crashed entirely. ”So there’s this period from 1989 to about 1996 when people aren’t even trying to sell their buildings anymore,” he says. “They’re just surrendering them. Residential buildings, industrial buildings, office blocks…people are moving into all those spaces, and the owners are just throwing up their hands and walking away, leaving the municipality and the banks to clean up behind them. Everybody forgets this. They say the banks are bad for redlining these areas. But the banks lost billions in defunct sectional title blocks and skyscrapers over which they held bonds. Debtors would flee the country. The banks were burned proper.”

Once the banks pulled out, downtown buildings had to be bought with cash, and almost nobody was willing to sink their own money in a zone that seemed to be heading toward Mad Max-style dystopia. By 1999, eastern Jeppe Street had become a place where you could buy a blighted, squatter-infested four-storey building for R350,000, three to five percent of what it would have been worth in the area’s heyday.

But the zone had advantages that were visible only to those with an eye for business. It was, for a start, located within walking distance of Park Station, and even closer to the giant Noord Street taxi terminal. On any given day, thousands of township and cross-border traders poured into the city through those two ports of entry, looking for goods to buy and take home for resale. As of l999, their needs were serviced by orthodox sales emporia – street-level retailers and wholesalers who’d had the courage to tough it out in what was generally perceived as a lawless zombie zone.

But change was coming, driven inter alia by events in the Horn of Africa. Ethiopians started trickling into South Africa as early as l993, but their numbers remained small until 2005, when Ethiopian strongman Miles Zenawi was almost unseated in a ferociously competitive election. In the aftermath, Zenawi cracked down heavily on those who had voted against him, precipitating a flood of refugees to South Africa. Most of them, like the aforementioned Haile, began their new lives on Jeppe Street, at the heart of what soon became known as the Ethiopian Quarter, or Little Ethiopia.

A second driver of change was China’s emergence as a great trading power. Once a poverty-stricken Communist backwater, China instituted pro-market reforms circa l978 and began to grow exponentially, churning out consumer goods and clothes at impossibly low prices and shipping enormous volumes of them to markets across the planet. In Johannesburg, these products usually wound up in Chinese-owned warehouses on the outskirts of downtown, where amazing deals were available to sharp traders. Many of these were Ethiopians who transported Chinese goods across town and put them on sale in Little Ethiopia – a development that has since transformed the economic fortunes of this sector of the inner city.

Researcher Tanya Zack dates the start of Little Ethiopia’s rise to circa 2003, and acknowledges that it was made possible largely by the fact that Joburg’s downtown was a place where municipal and other authorities had long since lost control. Municipal by-laws hadn’t been enforced for decades. Hawkers had taken over most sidewalks. Policing was minimal, enforcement of labour laws and copyright laws almost non-existent. This created the conditions necessary for a dumbfounding explosion of informal trading.

The other day, I trekked downtown to view the outcome. Medical Centre had become the epicentre of what municipal officials call “the chaos precinct.” The street outside was clogged with delivery vehicles, the sidewalks choked by masses of jostling pedestrians. Every spare inch of pavement was occupied by stalls or tables loaded with clothes, shoes, dark glasses and cosmetics. The din was deafening.

At first glance, there seemed to be four life-forms operating in this frenzied free-trade zone. At the bottom, on the street, there were stalls or tables where small-time sales artists from all over Africa worked the passing trade. Some of the goods on offer in this zone looked dicey – “Levi Strauss” jeans for R100, and Springbok rugby jerseys for R80, less than ten percent of what you’d pay for the authorized version in a suburban shopping mall.

Next came the street-level shopkeepers, who had roofs over their heads and a broader repertoire of goods for sale, including curtains, one of the specialities of the district.

The lobby of Medical Centre, which once had an elegant concierge, was like the gateway to hell, crammed with shouting traders. Its dim interior was like a medieval souk, with tiny stalls piled to the ceiling with merchandise. Great rivers of shoppers were climbing a chipped and battered staircase towards the upper floors, which had been converted into showrooms and workshops by a third and higher caste of Ethiopian businessman.

On one of those upper floors, we entered a showroom piled with towering bolts of material. Two Malawians sat at sewing machines, pumping out curtain trimmings and linings. The operators at this level are manufacturers, but also retailers and wholesalers, selling goods into the rest of Africa. Above them in the hierarchy (and the building) are the really big boys, Ethiopian dons who use the remaining floors of Medical Centre for storage and living space.

Someone told me that a consortium of Ethiopian traders had bought this building for scores of millions. On first hearing, this struck me as unlikely, but I was at the foot of a steep learning curve. According to transactions listed on Property24.com, a nearby building changed hands in 2002 for R300,000. Four years later, another fetched R600,000. By 2011, prices had risen to the extent that some lucky investor was able to sell a building for R6.5 million, but that was nothing compared to what was to come. In 2012, a building 150m away fetched R48 million. The old Jeppe Street Post Office, 100m in the other direction, was auctioned last year for R95 million.

Intrigued by all this activity, I pulled the title deed for Medical Centre. As downtown property headed towards its nadir, the building fell into the hands of First National Bank, which managed to unload it to a Taiwanese entity in 1993 for R500,000. At some unknown point, it was taken over by Ethiopian tenants who prospered to the extent that they were able to buy it 2011 for R52 million – a hundred-fold increase in 18 years.

Rents have experienced a similar explosion. In 1990s, retail space in the inner city cost as little as R30 per square meter per month. By 2012, when Tanya Zack conducted her research, rentals elsewhere in downtown had risen to around R180 per square metre. The owners of Soweto’s shopping malls were charging around R320 per square metre, while shopkeepers in Sandton had to pay R800 for the same amount of space. In Little Ethiopia, choice trading spaces were even more expensive, and obtainable only by paying “key money” sometimes running into hundreds of thousands of Rand. At the very apex of the rental pyramid, Zack found a woman who was paying R4,000 a month for a shop barely larger than a cupboard. That translated into a monthly rental of R2,000 per square metre – the highest rent in Africa, by her calculation, and among the highest on the planet.

So how did it come to this? I could repeat all the standard clichés about hard work, thrift and social networks but let’s rather look at Little Ethiopia through the eyes of Tibebeselassie Tigabu, a hip young writer sent to South Africa in 2015 by The Reporter of Addis Ababa. Tigabu speaks Amharic and knows the Ethiopian pop stars whose music provides the soundtrack in the chaos precinct. Even so, his questions are greeted with silence and suspicion until he falls among some “gangsters” who offer to give him the inside story.

Like Haile, these young men jumped the border and started at the bottom, staggering around Soweto with loads of curtains and lying awake at night in communal dormitories, listening to gunshots in the street outside. Unable to bear the torment of door-to-door selling -- “the scorching sun” and “feet shaking from the long walk” – they fanned out into rural areas to try their hand at trading, and when that failed, returned to Little Ethiopia to practice ayer bayer– Ethiopian slang for the art of making truckloads of incoming merchandise “disappear in thin air.” These wide boys inform Tigabu that “80 percent of the businesses Ethiopians run here are not entirely clean,” a reference to the fact that Little Ethiopia is a de facto free-trade zone where evasion of import duties is fairly common, and at least some goods are counterfeit. Hence ultra-low prices that draw customers from as far away as Kinshasha to buy goods for resale.

Tanya Zack’s narrative of the rise of Little Ethiopia follows a less breathless trajectory. As she tells it, most refugees arrived penniless and initially worked for someone else. In time, they managed to save a little cash and start trading in their own right. According to Zack, they typically hired space from established Ethiopian lease-holders, who were continually subdividing their space as rents rose. Trading spaces grew smaller and smaller, until every square centimeter was intensely utilized. She once paced off the street frontage of one building, and then counted the number of businesses operating along the pavement and on the floors above it. Around sixty metres wide at its base, the building housed 283 retail outlets, all competing ferociously with each other. It had become, as she says, “a vertical shopping mall” whose existence was known only to those flocking to shop there.

So how do Ethiopians make a living in tiny shops surrounded by thousands of competitors? Zack befriended a woman she named Berta, and did a close study of her operation. She found that Berta worked 11 hours a day, and kept her mark-ups to a bare minimum – “R1 to R1.50 on most items.” This caused stock to fly off her shelves, and if she ran out, she could just nip upstairs and buy new merchandise from a wholesaler. By keeping a sharp eye on trends and churning her stock in this manner, she was able to generate a profit of R1000 a day – a middle-class income in South African terms.

Some of Berta’s earnings, one presumes, went to renting a nearby flat for herself and her family, thereby powering a parallel revolution. Over the last decade, tens of thousands of working people have returned to the inner city to rent moderately priced flats, typically located in clean, safe buildings with tight security at their entrances. The rescue and refurbishment of these buildings was made possible by organizations like Paul Jackson’s Trust for Urban Housing Finance, which stepped into the vacuum created by departing banks and has since lent billions to entrepreneurs willing to take on the challenges of the inner city. Once this risky model proved viable, inner-city property prices began to recover, and now stand at 1000 percent above their level in 2003.

We asked Jackson how many Ethiopians were now living and working in the inner city. Like everyone else, he had no idea, but he was willing to contribute one snippet of hard information – his company alone has financed five Ethiopian acquisitions– and hazard a guess at the rest: roughly 70 percent of buildings in the two-km-square chaos precinct are either owned or controlled (via head leases) by Ethiopians.

The newcomers’ free-market zeal has not exactly endeared them to Johannesburg’s municipality. For years, the city’s ANC administration fought a losing battle against uncontrolled street trading of the sort that takes place in and around Little Ethiopia. The new Democratic Alliance regime is equally inclined to complain about lawlessness, mess and rampant violations of municipal bylaws. In other respects, though, it is clear that the Ethiopian presence has added hugely to the sum of light in the inner city. The spectacular rise in property prices has resulted in a windfall for the municipality, now reaps a fortune in rates and taxes buildings that once yielded nothing but headaches. Beyond that, researchers estimate that cross-border trading contributes R17 billion a year to the city’s economy. Ethiopians deserve an unknown but significant part of the credit here. They are also creating jobs for South Africans[1] and stimulating demand for local goods and services, while the richest among them are now permanent residents and taxpayers.

What these case studies tell us about ourselves

As we observed at the outset, South Africa’s ANC government (along with most rival political parties) believes black advancement is made difficult or impossible by the legacy of apartheid and colonialism. Proof of this contention is found in the enduring gulf between black and white incomes, and the chosen remedies are affirmative action or BEE laws intended to force whites to open the door and allow blacks to enter the promised land.

At the same time, government and its allies in big business and academe are constantly plotting ways of sharpening black entrepreneurial skills – incubators, small-business subsidies, training courses and informal sector upliftment schemes of the sort in sidebar 1. Since the ANC came to power in l994, South Africa has spent untold billions on such projects, and they have achieved little or nothing; black unemployment remains seven times higher than white, while black households continue to earn less than one-fifth of their white counterparts. This reinforces belief in the central contention of black politics in South Africa: whites conspire to keep blacks down, a problem that only be resolved by intensified affirmative action or a conclusive Marxist-Fanonist revolution of the sort favoured by Julius Malema’s Economic Freedom Fighters.

The stories we’ve just heard raise fundamental questions about the truth of these beliefs. The actors in these migrant economic dramas are all black, using the broad definition favoured by Pan-Africanists. As such, they must face exactly the same forms of discrimination as black South Africans, and many additional obstacles besides – rampant xenophobia, a banking industry that is unwilling to open accounts for them and a government that denies them all manner of benefits available to black South Africans, including state subsidies for black entrepreneurs and participation in preferential procurement schemes that require formal-sector businesses to place a portion of their orders with black suppliers.

And yet, foreigners make it here. Some of the stories told above might convey the misleading impression that all migrants are pulling R20k a month as waiters in posh restaurants, or buying inner-city buildings with suitcases full of cash. These are exceptional cases, but the literature demonstrates that foreigners are more likely to be working than South Africans, and in the few cases where data is available, earning more than their South African counterparts. For instance, a study in Cape Town revealed that the average monthly income of foreign micro-traders was R4121, considerably more than the black South African mean of R2998 as calculated by Wits University researchers. In Johannesburg, the equivalent figure was R6401.

How do they achieve such outcomes? According to academic studies, they enjoy no discernible educational advantage over South Africans, and few arrive with more than a few dollars in capital. But they do come with a radically different attitude toward work, invariably born of desperation.

A survey conducted in 2008 showed that 80 percent of South Africa’s unemployed were also desperate for work and willing to start for very little, provided there was some prospect of advancement. But 62 percent said this got them nowhere, because there were simply “no jobs available.” Foreigners dispute this claim, contending that there are all sorts of opportunities here for those willing to start at the bottom or create work for themselves.

It might be easiest if we deal with these two strategies separately. There are two classes of migrant, first of which is those who come here to work for others -- Zimbabwean restaurant staff, Malawian gardeners, Mozambican contract labourers who harvest the crops of white commercial farmers and several hundred thousand foreigners who wear uniforms and guard buildings for ultra-low wages. The literature suggests that exploitation is rife in some of these sectors. A foreign security guard interviewed for this report claimed to be working 26 twelve-hour shifts a month in return for R2000 in cash under the table. That translates into only R72 a day, an income that forces Jackson Mtonga to make a brutal choice between eating and spending an additional three hours a day walking to and from his shack in a distant squatter encampment.

That’s shameful, but what’s to be done about it? The government could snap out of its lethargy and make it more difficult for migrants to jump the border. Economic theory dictates that a shortage of cheap labour would inevitably drive wages upwards to a point where locals might consider taking Jackson’s job. But meanwhile, Jackson is not complaining. “I have no choice,” he says, pointing out that there are no jobs at all in Malawi, and that R72 a day has at least enabled him to acquire a foothold in Johannesburg and search for something better.

We encountered an identical attitude among the dozen or so Zimbabwean restaurant workers interviewed for this report. Let’s hear from a few of them.

Amy: “We know how to sacrifice. We have to work. My first job was washing dishes for R1000 a month. Luckily my mom was working as a domestic so I was able to share her room, otherwise I would not have made it. Then I trained as a chef for a few years, and now I am a waitress. I earn R8k a month, sometimes more.”

Could South Africans not do this too? Amy giggles. “South Africans can’t do hard labour,” she says. “It is not for them. Actually, it’s not that they can’t. They won’t. I don’t know how this got into their minds. They want things, but they won’t work for it.”

Emily: “My first restaurant job was washing dishes for R50 a day, but if you’ve been through what I’ve been through, you just force yourself. With South Africans, it’s about 50-50. Some know that if you want something, you have to work hard for it. But some aren’t interested. Restaurant work is too much for them. The hours are too long. They don’t have to be fired. They quit.”

Michael: “Black South Africans are only interested in jobs with a pay slip, medical aid and pension. This job I do (he washes dishes for R120 a day) is too low for them.”

James: “There is a laziness of some sort among South Africans. They haven’t experienced problems to push them out of the country where they were born, so they think everything should come as a manna from heaven. That’s why you find illegal connection of electricity, or people with RDP houses selling them to foreigners and then going back on the RDP waiting list again. Where I come from there are problems and I know I must strive. I must be determined to find something to survive. That is the difference.”

We could continue in this vein indefinitely without denting popular perceptions, so let’s just observe that there is more low-paid work in South Africa than meets the eye, and at least some of it is being taken up by foreigners who have no choice other than to open themselves to a degree of exploitation in the hope of improving their situation in the long run. It could also be argued that their presence here makes life easier and cheaper for many of us. I have my hair cut at a Pakistani barbershop that charges R40, about a third of what I’d pay at a posh hairdresser in Rosebank mall. The Indian suburbanite who employs Jackson Mtonga gets his house guarded for R6 an hour. Mr. D, the Soweto businessman, hires migrants to offload his delivery trucks. “Locals say, this is hard work, I want R100,” he says. “If a foreigner comes, I can offer him R15 or R20 and he will be happy. Who would you opt for?”

The second class of migrants – those who come here to work for themselves – are also victims of exploitation, but the resource they exploit most intensely is themselves. You will recall the story of Haile, the Ethiopian bank clerk whose first job entailed selling curtains on commission for R50 a day, if he was lucky. We heard a similar story from a Somali named Said, who was given one blanket on credit and sent off to sell it in Alexandra township. When he returned with the money, he was given two blankets a day, and then five, and then ten. After a while, he saved enough to buy himself a partnership in a spaza business, at which point he started exploiting his own people – Somali newcomers who had no choice either.

It is fashionable to shout about exploitation by whites, but nobody pays attention to foreigners exploiting one another. According to one study, wages in foreign-run spazas start at zero in the case of new arrivals who owe money to the syndicate that smuggled them across the border; they work seven days a week for nothing but food until their debt is repaid. In his landmark study of Somali-run spazas in Delft, Rory Leiden found that low-level employees were working all day, every day, for as little as R800 a month. South Africans would perceive such wages as a massive indignity, but for Somalis, they offered a chance to get a foot in the door, save money, and move on to greater things. Many would eventually graduate into partnerships, in which earnings ranged as high as R10,000 a month. Some, one presumes, made it to the big league, where Somali and Ethiopian traders buy tall buildings at prices way out of the range of most South Africans, including whites.

Tanya Zack, who is writing a book about Johannesburg’s Little Ethiopia, warns that it’s wrong to assume all foreigners are rich. “There are many, many unsuccessful foreign business people too,” she says. “Many live on almost nothing for years while they build their business.” But then again, many succeed, and they have collectively made an incalculable contribution to Johannesburg’s economy, in the process giving something of a bloody nose to the amorphous force known as ‘white monopoly capital.’

I say this because inner-city property was a whites-only game ten years ago. Most of the buildings colonized by those frenzied Ethiopian traders were owned by white speculators who made a killing when rentals started surging upwards. One veteran inner-city property observer tells a story about a giant JSE-listed company that could scarcely believe its luck when monthly rentals in one of its buildings rose to R450 per square metre, only to discover that their lease-holders were carving up the space and re-renting it to fellow Ethiopians for nearly double that. And when the Ethiopians tired of acting as cash cows for whites, they formed consortia and started buying buildings themselves.

In a similar way, the advent of foreign-run spazas is challenging the interests of “white” retail chains in the townships and causing unease at giant wholesalers like Masscash. Like the rise of Little Ethiopia, this forces us to entertain an extraordinary conclusion: contrary to popular belief, ‘white monopoly capital’ is not immune to challenge by black rivals who come from nothing, work hard, and against all odds, make significant economic headway[2]. Black South Africans could do the same.

In fact, they’re doing it already. “It’s absurd to say that black South Africans are useless entrepreneurs,” says GG Alcock, the “white Zulu” who spends his life studying the intricate workings of South Africa’s informal sector. “They kill in businesses they know and understand.” Foremost of these is the so-called “KasiKos” industry, a R80-billion-a-year behemoth consisting of scores of thousands of micro-entrepreneurs who sell fast food at train stations, taxi ranks or lately, at fancy township joints specializing in South African soul food –kotas, vetkoek or pap en vleis. According to Alcock, black South Africans favour this food partly because it is cheap – as little as R14 for a kota packed with soy mince, onions, chilis and potatoes – but mostly because they prefer it. So they buy it in enormous quantities, providing micro-entrepreneurs with incomes ranging from R1500 to R10,000 a month and making some very rich indeed.

“I know a kota king who pitched up at a car dealership wanting to buy a new Jeep four-by-four for R500,000 in cash,” says Alcock. “The whiteys thought he was a drug dealer, because they had of course never heard of kotas. I mean, come on. This guy buys five thousand loaves of bread a day. He employs dozens of people to cut onions and fry mince. His operation is as fine-tuned and sophisticated as Shoprite’s.”

Alcock takes the view that entrepreneurship is a cultural commodity, and he’s right. If you’d visited any small South African town a century ago, you would have found Jews running the trading stores, because that’s what they were good at. Afrikaner businessmen were vanishingly rare in 1917. Afrikaners farmed. Jews traded, and in due course moved on to greater things. Their place was taken by Portuguese and Greek immigrants who have also since disappeared. Today, small towns are full of spazas run by Ethiopians or Somalis and cellphone shops run by Pakistanis, while local blacks dominate the Kasikos, taxi and tavern sectors, because that is what they’re good at. In the cities, you find a similar degree of ethnic specialization. Mozambicans dominate the tricky fresh fruit and vegetable sector, but locals are holding their own in the hairstyling business in the face of stiff competition from Cameroonians and Nigerians. And the mini-bus taxi trade is of course entirely under South African control, everywhere.

All these business are black-owned. None were created by government, and none derive benefits from affirmative action laws or government preferential procurement schemes. They evolved naturally. Humans saw opportunities and pursued them. A significant subset of these entrepreneurs are black migrants from elsewhere in Africa, and their success comes in spite of rampant xenophobia, constant police harassment and repeated government attempts to reduce their numbers by formulating laws like the draft Refugee Amendment Act of 2015, which sought to strip asylum seekers of the right to work, or the draft Business Licensing Bill of 2013, which proposed the creation of a new bureaucracy that would exclude foreigners whose working papers were not in order.

Under these circumstances, it’s surprising that foreign traders have survived at all, let alone prospered to an extent where they can challenge “white” domination in certain arenas. Their success is testimony to a rare triumph of the human spirit, and the endurance of allegedly outmoded values like hard work and perseverance. As Lindiwe Zulu intuited, they have something important to tell us. It is not too late to listen.

Sidebar 1 – ENLIGHTENED SELF-INTEREST

Five reasons why SA should learn to live with the amaKwere-Kwere

Professor Jonathan Crush, head of the South African Migration Programme, says South Africans are the worst xenophobes on the planet. A recent survey showed that 30 percent of us want a total prohibition on foreigners coming to work here – “easily the highest of any country surveyed,” according to Crush. An additional 48 percent want strict limits to entry. An earlier survey revealed that around a third of us believe foreigners should be reported to police and deported. Another 11 percent were prepared to do the job themselves, using violence.

The central source of hostility to immigration is the ubiquitous perception that “foreigners are stealing our jobs.” Is that true? Well, yes, in some sectors, and to some extent. But it is also true that foreigners start new business, stimulate the local economy and create jobs.

How many jobs? Years of acrimonious debate in this regard were recently settled by SA Migration Programme researchers who interviewed 1136 migrant business people in Johannesburg and Cape Town and established that they’d created an average of three new jobs apiece – one for themselves, and two for others. Roughly a third of their employees were South African.

Those numbers are probably too low to shift the xenophobes, so let’s look at the same question from a different angle: what do South Africans lose if all migrants are sent home again?

1) Low prices & convenience. As seen in the main piece, the Mohammedan takeover of the spaza trade has conferred huge blessings on South African township residents. They can shop on their doorsteps, and spaza prices are usually the cheapest in the city. Same applies to all those cut-price merchants in Little Ethiopia. Small traders wouldn’t flock to them from all over Africa if they weren’t getting good deals.

3) Rentals. As stated elsewhere, some 70,000 to 90,000 South Africans are now renting their spazas to foreign traders, and that’s just the tip of a vast rental iceberg that eludes government radar. Let’s imagine, arguendo, that Stats SA’s estimate of 1.7 million foreigners is a radical undercount, and that the real number of migrants is around three million. Where do they stay? All but the richest and most established of them can’t buy property, because they typically have no bank accounts and thus no access to bonds and home loans. And they can’t get RDP houses, because those are available only to citizens. So they have to rent. Even if they’re all paying a rock-bottom R300 a month for a single room in a township backyard, that adds up to a cumulative annual windfall of R10 billion for South Africans.

In Vrygrond, a small township near Muizenberg, almost every brick house is surrounded by densely-packed tin shacks, with three or four crammed into every yard. I spoke to the owner of such an establishment, let’s call her Mrs Mavis. She said her immediately family (herself, common-law husband and son) owned three RDP houses between them. They all lived in one, and had converted the others into rental units and backyard shacks. She said, “I rent only to foreigners. South Africans are too cheeky. They always want rights. But foreigners know that if they don’t pay, I will get my friends from the police to throw them out and deport them.”

By my calculation, Mrs. Mavis is making at least R10,000 a month in rentals, all in cash and untaxed. How many South Africans are in a similarly sweet position?

3) Economic stimulation. Ten years ago, it was generally assumed that most foreigners were engaged in what’s known as survivalist trading. -- you buy a handful of sweets and cigarettes and sell them on the street, making just enough to feed yourself and restock your stall or table. A study in Cape Town paints a very different picture. The vast majority of foreign traders started out with capital of R5,000 or less. Within three years, however, all had at least doubled the value of their businesses, and 40 percent had amassed R50,000 or more.

It’s worth noting that small-scale street traders and spaza operators cannot escape paying VAT on goods purchased from wholesalers, thereby contributing to the nation’s coffers and stimulating the wholesalers’ turnover. Which in turn helps us to understand why Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, was willing to pay around R35 billion for a 51 percent stake in Massmart in 2012 – the largest direct foreign investment in this country in years. Why did the Americans find Massmart attractive? Inter alia, because it sells huge volumes of wholesale goods and groceries to township traders, most of whom are foreigners these days. If the foreigners go, trade declines and countless South African farmers and manufacturers suffer, along with all their employees.

4) Bribes. It seems fair to assume that foreigner traders don’t pay much in the way of taxes, partly because their income usually falls under the tax threshold, but also because their profits are unbanked and thus undetectable. On the other hand, they are constantly required to make forced donations to government officials.

There is a voluminous literature on this subject, and it suggests that huge numbers of South African government officials are topping up their salaries by soliciting bribes from border-jumpers, refugees and alien traders.

This begins at the border, where cops and soldiers can be paid not to notice illegal immigrants. A recent study revealed that “the cheapest of various smuggling services (around the Beit Bridge border post) was run by police officials” who were charging R100 a head to let migrants through.

Inside the country, migrants often have to negotiate police roadblocks set up to “tax” the incoming stream. When they reach the cities, those intending to claim asylum must report to the Department of Home Affairs’ refugee reception offices. Another recent study established that 30 percent of asylum seekers were hit up for bribes during the application process, usually more than four times apiece. At the Marabastad refugee centre in Pretoria, the proportion reporting bribe overtures rose to fifty percent.

Even if you manage to get papers, you’re still vulnerable. “Cops recognize Somalis by their features,” says Amir Sheik, the Somali activist. “If they see one of us behind the wheel of a car, they always stop you, and even if everything is in order, they still ask for ‘cold drink.’” A study of Zimbabwe migrants living in Johannesburg reached a similar conclusion: “Police officers routinely engage in intimidation and extortion of, and simple theft from, Zimbabweans and other migrants.”

Tanya Zack, who has spent years studying Little Ethiopia, says its denizens dread the appearance of municipal police, national police and inspectors from SARS or Customs. “Officers from all these law-enforcement agencies are known for massive extortion,” she says. Police would often confiscate a traders’ merchandize on the grounds that it was counterfeit, then offer to return it if they were suitably compensated. They were also willing ignore immigration violations in return for a bribe.

5) Self-respect. Why are these migrants here? Because we allowed them in. To some extent, this is a function of our slackness and our inability to police immigration properly. But it is also a function of our signature on international treaties binding us to grant at least temporary asylum to anyone claiming to be a refugee. So yes, many of these asylum claims are strategic, but some aren’t. This applies particularly to Ethiopians, Zimbabweans, and anyone fleeing the war zones of eastern Congo and south-central Somalia. Sending those people home would be dishonourable and cruel.

So what’s the solution? The other day, informal sector guru GG Alcock was invited to speak at some government-sponsored Township Economies Conference, heavily attended by black businessmen of the sort who pressurize government to expel the amaKwere-kwere. Anticipating a hostile reaction, he opened by saying, “I know there are people here who will disagree with me, so bring it on.” He then opined that it was nuts to compete head-on with fanatically hardworking Mohammedan spaza operators, and much better to profit from the opportunities they create. Buy a bakkie and do transport for them. Set up a security company to protect them. Bid for contracts to do things they can’t do themselves, like revamping and refurbishing their shops.

Alock went on to propose a system whereby all foreign traders would be allocated points for creating jobs, buying South African and paying taxes, and that those who surpassed a certain threshold should be granted South African citizenship. Expectations to the contrary, he was awarded a standing ovation. Maybe he’s onto something.

SIDE BAR 2 -- Creating entrepreneurs the ANC way

Given our firm belief in free enterprise as the only palliative for human misery, the IRR was impressed when Trevor Manuel’s planning commission declared that entrepreneurship was the force that would propel South Africa into the promised land of economic plenty. This apparently post-socialist idea gestated in the bowels of government for a year or two before bursting into public view in 2013 in the form of a hugely ambitious scheme to turn South Africans into “a nation of entrepreneurs, not job seekers.”

That’s a quote from Lindiwe Zulu whose Ministry of Small Business Development aims to divert 30 percent of government’s R500 billion a year procurement budget into the hands of small businesses or cooperatives. Toward this end, her department envisages the creation of 20 state-financed “enterprise academies” and as many as 250 “small business incubators” that will provide billions in start-up financing to mostly black-owned small businesses, thereby generating millions of jobs and driving unemployment down to 6 percent by 2030.

As word of this plan spread, government reported a sharp rise in the number of small enterprises registering for tax purposes, along with an exponential surge in the number of registered co-operatives (these rose from 4562 in 2005 to 120,251 in 2016). One assumes that many of these new enterprises were created as receptacles for an anticipated avalanche of new government tenders, especially at local government level, where officials were encouraged to “train youth, small businesses and cooperatives to apply for municipal tenders.”

In a speech to parliament in 2015, Ms. Zulu positioned herself as a champion of underdogs in their struggle against fat cats. “Big companies have for a long time managed to crowd out small businesses through their financial muscle, cash reserves and economies of scale,” she said. ""For example, it is much easier for big companies to sell products at lower prices and in the process squeeze out small businesses when competing for government procurement opportunities, especially because government considers the lowest price over development considerations when procuring goods.”

“Development considerations” is of course code for “racial considerations.” So what happens when government disregards price and makes procurement decisions on the basis of race?

Late last year, Noseweek published an expose based on leaks from the Democratic Alliance/EFF coalition that had recently taken office in Tshwane metro. According to Noseweek, outgoing ANC administration had established a database of 40,000 approved vendors, most of whom were “recently registered shelf companies operating from residential addresses” or co-ops established to create “entrepreneurial” jobs for the city’s unemployed youth. These middlemen were allegedly profiting from “outrageous” markups on municipal micro-tenders. In many cases, says Noseweek, “entrepreneurs” simply bought goods at wholesalers and delivered them to the municipality at markups of up to 400 percent. In this way, Tshwane wound up paying R300 apiece for light bulbs that cost R79 at Makro, and R70 for three-point plugs that cost R15.

There is an important point to be made here. Turning South Africans into a nation of entrepreneurs is a great idea. Some aspects of the ANC’s master plan show promise. Others, like the Tshwane fiasco, remind us of less salubrious transformation outcomes – overpriced coal and diesel at ESKOM, absurdly expensive power stations, water projects whose costs mysteriously surge once the work gets underway, and so on. This is what comes of regarding race as more important than the price and quality of services provided: everyone loses save insiders. And the biggest losers are ordinary citizens whose longing for a better life goes unrequited while government diverts our taxes into the pockets of play-play entrepreneurs.

As the ANC’s hold on power weakens, diverting procurement funds to black-owned small business has become a key to its survival. The scale of this scheme is dumbfounding, rivaled only by social grants, which cost SA around R125 billion a year. The preferential procurement ploy seeks to transfer an additional R150 billion a year into the hands of the previously disadvantaged. If it is mishandled, or allowed to turn into a looting exercise, it will destroy the country as surely as nuclear war.

The IRR likes the idea of unleashing forces that sharpen competition and break up unhealthy concentrations of economic power. But if Ms. Zulu’s scheme is to work for the good of the nation, there is still only one way to do it: make tender processes transparent, award contracts to the lowest bidder, and allow the winners to sink or swim in the real world, like the industrious migrants and Kasikos entrepreneurs in the adjoining pages.

The model-turned-actress Cara Delevingne shared an awkward moment when she was forced to talk about having sex on a plane, in front of her father Charles Delevingne on ‘The Graham Norton Show’.

While Delevingne among other guests were chatting on varied topics on the show on Friday, it all went down when host Graham Norton decided to repeat something that Delevingne said to him privately backstage, reports dailymail.co.uk.

""I think your embarrassment threshold is quite high,"" Norton said to Delevingne, who asked him ""Why?"" with a concerned look on her face.

""Well we were talking about having sex on a plane,"" Norton said.

To that, Delevingne: ""As have you.""

Norton then admitted he has indeed had sex on a plane, at which point TV presenter Jonathan Ross, who accompanied Delevingne, remarked that ""it doesn't count if it's with yourself!""

Norton then turned back on Delevingne: ""You were doing it, and a man was watching it...""

Later Delevingne said: ""My father is here by the way, sorry dad...""

It didn't stop here as Norton went on to add: ""I was worried where that anecdote was going then. So you were having sex on a plane and someone was watching you.""

Feeling awkward by his questions, Delevingne stumbled over her words and said: ""I don't even know how to start this story.""
