Force majeure is an event that occurs beyond your reasonable control or anticipation. When that event prevents you from performing your contractual obligations, you are ordinarily released from liability for damages caused by that breach. The rationale is that it would not be just to blame you for breach of contract when the contract became impossible to perform through no fault of your own.

The massive flood arriving in early October from northern Thailand has attacked at least seven industrial estates, including Saha Rattana Nakorn, Rojana, Hi-Tech, Bang Pa-in, Factoryland, Nava Nakorn, and Bangkadi in Ayutthaya and Pathum Thani. The Ministry of Industry estimated that the flood affected 9,859 factories in eight provinces, with the total value of damages amounting to approximately THB 237 billion as of November 21. The floods have upset supply chains worldwide, and made it difficult or even impossible for many businesses to perform their ordinary contract obligations.

After the flood recedes, a large amount of litigation may ensue over the damages caused directly and indirectly by the flooding and the resulting contract liabilities. A typical defendant may have failed to deliver goods or services to the plaintiff in time because the defendant's facility was directly affected by the flood, or perhaps because the defendant's own supply chain was interrupted by the floods that hit its suppliers. Whether or not the defendant's contract with the plaintiff has a force majeure clause, it may be possible to avoid liability on grounds of force majeure, but the outcome is not a foregone conclusion and will depend on the facts surrounding each situation.

Meaning of Force Majeure

Many commercial contracts contain force majeure clauses that include an itemized list of events that the parties have agreed will constitute force majeure. Oftentimes ""floods"" or other ""acts of God"" are included in that list. A typical force majeure clause might read as follows: ""A party's failure to perform any term or condition of this Agreement as a result of conditions beyond its control such as, but not limited to, war, strikes, fires, floods, terrorism, power failures, or damage or destruction of any network facilities or servers, shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement."" A clause of this nature provides a contractual definition of force majeure, plus a contractual allocation of risk when such an event prevents performance.

It is always preferable to have a clear force majeure clause in a contract, but the general principle of force majeure also applies even when the contract is silent. Under Section 8 of the Civil and Commercial Code (CCC), force majeure is defined as ""any event the happening or pernicious result of which could not be prevented even though a person against whom it happened or threatened to happen takes such appropriate care as might be expected from him in his situation and in such condition."" Thereafter, Sections 205 and 219 of the CCC provide that a debtor is relieved from his contractual obligations if performance becomes impossible because a circumstance for which he is not responsible occurs after creation of the obligation.

These provisions (and others scattered throughout the CCC) relieve a party of liability for many breaches of contract if the breach is caused by force majeure, even if the contract does not include a force majeure clause. That said, force majeure is not always a magic wand that will prevent a party's liability for failure to perform an obligation.

Force majeure necessarily includes two important conditions:

the event cannot be prevented; and the use of proper care. To examine whether these conditions existed at the time of breach, the breaching party needs to assemble information, evidence, and witnesses to confirm that he had professionally-appropriate mitigation plans in place before, during, and after the flood arrived. If he can establish that he had appropriate plans in place and that he implemented those plans, he can reasonably argue that the speed and size of the flood could not have been anticipated and was overwhelming even in the face of such measures.

Once a particular flood situation is proven to be force majeure, the breaching party still needs to prove that the flood prevented him for performing the contractual obligation. Inconvenience is probably not an excuse. For example, if flooding prevented a supplier from delivering parts to a manufacturer, the supplier might be forgiven on grounds of force majeure, but it is unlikely the manufacturer will be released from its downstream obligations unless the manufacturer tried without success to obtain the same inputs elsewhere. While the Thailand flooding has affected supply chains worldwide, it is unlikely that all parties in the supply chains will be able to blame the floods in Thailand if there was any reasonable means available to mitigate the disruption.

Thai Court Interpretations Regarding Floods

The Thai courts do not agree that every flood is considered an event of force majeure. In Supreme Court Case 1194/2531, a contractor sued an owner to recover the late fees that the owner withheld due to the contractor's failure to complete a pipeline project on time. The contractor argued that one delay occurred because heavy rains caused damage to a bridge en route to the construction site, interrupting the delivery of machinery and materials. The contractor argued that another delay occurred when rains made the river level too high to complete construction.

The Court agreed that the bridge incident was an event of force majeure because it could not be reasonably anticipated and prevented. But the Court did not agree that high water level during the rainy season constituted force majeure, because one should anticipate that water levels will rise dramatically during the rainy season. The Court dismissed the contractor's claim.

In Supreme Court Case 237/2542, an insurance company sued a warehouse for damages caused to cargo that the insurer's customer was storing in the warehouse at the Bangkok port. A heavy rain caused flooding at the warehouse and flood damage to the cargo inside. The Court ruled that the flood was not an event of force majeure, because the warehouse was engaged in a professional service and bore a warehouseman's duty to provide facilities that keep its customers' cargo in good condition. The defendant should have designed and constructed safeguards against this particular type and magnitude of flooding at its facility, and the Court ordered the warehouse to pay for the flood damage to the cargo.

When contracts do not include a force majeure clause, a party arguing that the recent Thailand flooding is an event of force majeure will bear the burden of proving that he took preventive measures at an appropriate level considering the person's profession, and in spite of these measures the floods were too sudden and extreme to be prevented. That party will need to establish that it planned and implemented preventive measures before and during the flooding, plus mitigation efforts after the flooding. All of these issues will be considered when determining whether a party is relieved of liability due the recent Thailand floods or other catastrophes that arguably amount to force majeure.

2,2,FL-2011-000196-IDN,"Global winds could explain record rains, tornadoes - University of Wisconsin-Madison",https://news.wisc.edu/global-winds-could-explain-record-rains-tornadoes/,"Two talks at a scientific conference this week will propose a common root for an enormous deluge in western Tennessee in May 2010, and a historic outbreak of tornadoes centered on Alabama in April 2011.

An aerial view shows severe flooding that hit Tennessee in 2010.

Both events seem to be linked to a relatively rare coupling between the polar and the subtropical jet streams, says Jonathan Martin, a University of Wisconsin–Madison professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences.

But the fascinating part is that the change originates in the western Pacific, about 9,000 miles away from the intense storms in the U.S. midsection, Martin says.

The mechanism that causes the storms originates during spring or fall when organized complexes of tropical thunderstorms over Indonesia push the subtropical jet stream north, causing it to merge with the polar jet stream.

The subtropical jet stream is a high-altitude band of wind that is normally located around 30 degrees north latitude. The polar jet stream is normally hundreds of miles to the north.

Martin calls the resulting band of wind a “superjet.”

Jet streams in the northern hemisphere blow from the west at roughly 140 miles per hour, and are surrounded by a circular whirlwind that looks something like a tornado pushed on its side. The circulating wind at the bottom of the jet stream blows from the south. On the north side, the circulating winds turn vertical, lifting and cooling the air until the water vapor condenses and feeds precipitation.

A superjet and its circulating winds carry roughly twice as much energy as a typical jet stream, Martin says. “When these usually separate jet streams sit atop one another, there tends to be a very strong vertical circulation, which produces clouds, precipitation and tornadoes under the right conditions.”

And because the circulating wind in a superjet moving across the U.S. south picks up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, “the superjet gives a double-whammy – more moisture, and more lifting, producing that intense rain.”

That was the case in May 2010, when 10 to 20 inches of rain fell around Nashville.

Andrew Winters, who is now a graduate student studying with Martin, latched onto the Tennessee flood as the topic of his senior undergraduate thesis in 2010. “It had a lot of interesting aspects, brought an anomalous amount of moisture into the southeast, and that hefty amount of rain,” Winters says.

And that super-strong jet stream “could be traced back to conditions in the western Pacific, almost a week earlier,” Winters says.

Martin and Winters describe their work in talks Dec. 6 and 7 at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.

Studies of the Tennessee floods, the Alabama tornados, and an odd October storm in Wisconsin showed “that when the subtropical jet is pushed poleward under the influence of strong thunderstorms in the western Pacific, it seems to result in these intense storms in the U.S. midsection,” Martin says. “It’s a really fascinating global connection that occurs seven to 10 days later.”

Martin also suggests the altered position of the subtropical jet stream may be linked to global warming.

“There is reason to believe that in a warmer climate, this kind of overlapping of the jet streams that can lead to high-impact weather may be more frequent,” Martin says.

That idea can be tested, Martin adds.

“Historic weather data should tell us whether there has been a change in the frequency of these overlapping events, and whether that might be linked to a change in high impact-weather events. It’s an interesting lead that could help us understand one possible mechanism by which a warmer climate could lead to an increase in severe weather,” he says.

Although hurricanes can be tracked for a week or more as they cross the Atlantic Ocean, weather phenomena seldom last so long, Martin says. “If the subtropical jet stream is rearranged and superposed on top of the polar jet stream, it might be the mechanism that allows for this very long delay, a disturbance that can have discernible effect on severe weather thousands of miles downstream, and a week or more later.”

Martin says that if the new analysis survives further study, it could contribute to severe weather forecasting.

Though severe weather was forecast a day or two in advance of the deadly tornado outbreak in the Southeast this April, “most tornado forecasts are made 12 or at most 24 hours in advance. That saves lives. But if we get the idea five or six days in advance that we should watch the position of the jet streams, we could say, ‘Hey, we have a pretty exciting week coming up, we have to be on high alert.’”","Mon, 05 Dec 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.wisc.edu/content/themes/news/images/favicon.ico?v=2,"['rains', 'martin', 'severe', 'weather', 'tornadoes', 'winters', 'global', 'explain', 'jet', 'subtropical', 'record', 'week', 'winds', 'wind', 'streams', 'stream']", 
3,3,FL-2011-000196-IDN,Asia must address climate issues fast: ADB | News - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/asia-must-address-climate-issues-fast-adb/,"Asian cities are increasingly at risk from rising sea levels and severe droughts and governments need to develop integrated urban plans that address urgent issues on water supply, flooding, transportation, and solid waste, a climate change expert said.

In the short term, cities can minimize the risk of destructive floods, such as in Bangkok, by improving drainage and sanitation systems and imposing a solid waste management scheme that promotes efficient garbage collection and reduces the use of plastics, WooChong Um of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank (ADB) told Reuters on Tuesday.

“It’s very clear. There is clear evidence that the storms and typhoons are getting more intense and more frequent,” said Um, deputy director general of the ADB’s regional and sustainable development department.

“And it is happening not just in one place but everywhere, Ondoy,Thailand, and who knows where the next one will be,” he said, referring to Typhoon Ketsana, which inundated around four-fifths of Manila in 2009, killed nearly 750 people, and damaged $1 billion worth of infrastructure and private properties.

“So it is kind of a wake up call for all the countries to do the necessary actions so that they are prepared,” Um said.

Asia and the Pacific had seen more than 30 million people displaced by environmental disasters in 2010, according to data from the ADB. The region is home to more than 4 billion people.

The region also accounted for 34 percent of recorded disasters, 90 percent of people affected, 32 percent of deaths and 33 percent of economic losses worldwide from natural disasters from 2005 to 2010.

Private sector demands for governments to address disaster risks would have the most impact on speeding up climate-related infrastructure development, Um said.

“The Bangkok one (flooding) really demonstrated the disruption in the value chain,” he said. “If the private sector makes it very clear, what are constraints that’s causing investors from coming in … If it is said by the industries themselves, then there is a bigger impact.”

Public-private partnership

Climate-related infrastructure projects could have a better success rate if undertaken via a public-private partnership, David McCauley, ADB’s lead climate change specialist, told Reuters in Singapore.

“There’s an incentive to work more closely with the private sector to address these risks, in terms of infrastructure.”

“Those sorts of decisions are best made more on a public-private basis, and I don’t think there has been adequate incentive or direction for that in the past,” McCauley added.

Flooding in Thailand since late July claimed 562 lives and swamped about 900 factories in industrial areas north of Bangkok, disrupting supply chains of international firms such as Toyota Motor Corp, Sony Corp and Lenovo Group Ltd.

“Bangkok has a land subsidence problem from over extraction of ground-water, Jakarta has it even worse. It’s literally sinking at the same time as the over-land flooding is increasing and the sea is rising,” McCauley said.

Um said the ADB is working with the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia in preparing country risk assessments that would identify climate and disaster threats, rehabilitation costs, and financing options such as catastrophe bonds.

Asian nations need to forecast their population growth and identify the infrastructure required so as not to choke their megacities and minimize climate risks. By 2020, more than half of the world’s 25 megacities will be located in Asia, most of them situated near the coasts, Um added.

Governments must also prioritize the development of rural areas and second-tier cities to lessen migration into urban centers and lower the risk of disasters such flooding, he said.","Tue, 29 Nov 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://eco-business.imgix.net/uploads/ebmedia/fileuploads/wp_uploads/2011/11/ondoy-flood.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,"['climate', 'risks', 'risk', 'private', 'address', 'adb', 'development', 'asia', 'infrastructure', 'um', 'fast', 'sector', 'issues', 'flooding', 'disasters']",

DADAAB, Kenya, November 28 (UNHCR) - Ibrahim held up an X-ray of his broken thigh bone, taken when he first arrived in the Dadaab refugee complex of north-eastern Kenya. Five months later, he still cannot walk.

""I fell off a car when I was heading to Kenya from the Bay region [in southern Somalia],"" the 31-year-old explained, sitting at the entrance of his white tent in the red earth. ""When I arrived in Dadaab, I went to the hospital. But I left because I was afraid they would amputate it.""

UNHCR field officer Henok Ochalla rebuked him for not using crutches, and called for an ambulance to take the father of six to the nearest camp hospital. ""If only we had an extended presence in the camps, we would be able to assess the situation of families and to refer medical cases like Ibrahim's,"" said Ochalla.

He and his colleagues were going from tent to tent in Dadaab's Ifo 2 camp, visiting families and noting down the details of people affected by the recent floods. This was the first time in weeks that UNHCR staff had been able to walk more or less freely among the blocks of Ifo 2.

Escalating insecurity - including the recent discovery of two improvised explosive devices and the kidnapping of three aid workers - has forced humanitarian agencies to scale down their work in Dadaab. Life-saving aid such as food distribution, water trucking and urgent medical aid is continuing, but less urgent services have been temporarily suspended.

""It is challenging for agencies to balance humanitarian assistance and define an acceptable threshold of risks to the lives of staff on the ground,"" said Dominik Bartsch, UNHCR's head of operations in Dadaab. ""Despite recent security incidents, we have worked intensively on a feasible way to maintain life-saving activities, especially for the most vulnerable refugees.""

The increased presence of policemen in Ifo 2 has allowed aid agencies to gradually resume activities in the camp. Last week saw the drilling of a new borehole, the building of a drainage system to prevent floods, and the installation of a 10-tent temporary hospital. A measles vaccination campaign is continuing.

However, the combination of floods and several weeks of reduced services is taking its toll. An outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea, including some cases of cholera, has affected more than 360 refugees across the camp so far. Symptoms of malnutrition are becoming more visible in children, with at least 300 refugees approaching the health post every day.

While UNHCR and its partners strive to respond within a shrinking operational space, the refugees themselves have stepped up to the daily challenges. Trained professionals such as health promoters, teachers and community peace and security teams have ensured the continuity of services in these uncertain times.

Ugandan refugee Walter helped to set up the new school in Ifo 2, a UNHCR-tented hall that hosts 1,000 students in 11 classes. He had arrived at Dadaab as a 15-year-old, completed his secondary education and received his teacher's certificate. Looking around the school he helps run, he said, ""We have been working every day because it was critical for the kids doing their exams. They had a hard time fleeing Somalia, and we owe them this effort.""

UNHCR's Bartsch affirmed, ""The refugees are contributing to their communities and providing a safe environment in the camps and for the humanitarian agencies. We fully support this valuable work they do day after day.""

With the fragile security situation in and around Dadaab, this partnership between refugees and aid agencies will continue to be crucial in preserving some sense of normalcy in the camps. Dadaab is the world's biggest refugee camp, home to some 460,000 refugees, more than 150,000 of whom arrived this year after fleeing drought and conflict in Somalia.

Meanwhile, Ibrahim was not fully convinced he should see the doctor as advised. Perhaps his leg will never recover after these long months of inaction. Perhaps he will eventually be able to hobble around with the help of crutches.

For now, he sits smiling as a UNHCR worker promises to bring him a new sleeping mat next week - if nothing prevents him from doing so.

Muslims believe that many key events in Islamic history occurred on the day, including the events of Karbala.



Holding flags and dressed in black, men and women, mostly belonging to the Shia sect -- who along with Sunnis make up India's 140 million Muslims -- took out processions, crying and beating their chests in the ceremonial ""maatam"" or mourning.



Barefoot men with blades and other sharp-edged weapons flagellated themselves and recited elegies in the memory of Hussain.



Delhi Police had put in place security measures to ensure that the day passes off peacefully as it also coincided with the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition anniversary.



""We had taken enough security measures for the processions in Delhi, like every other year. It was a peaceful day,"" Delhi Police spokesperson Rajan Bhagat told IANS.



The processions were taken out between mosques -- from Shia Jama Masjid in Kashmere Gate to Punja Sharif Karbala in the same locality and from Pahari Bhojla in Chittqualam near the historic Jama Masjid to Karbala in Jorbagh near Lodhi Road.



Special prayers were offered at the historic Shahi Masjid Fatehpuri and Khwaja Nizam-ud-din Auliya's shrine in south Delhi, where Muslims paid homage to Hussain.

Processions were also taken out in Muslim-dominated areas of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra and West Bengal.



In Srinagar, the Jammu and Kashmir government has banned the procession since the early 1990s for security reasons. However, Shia Muslims still carry out small processions in the interiors of the old city.



The authorities imposed restrictions in city centre Lal Chowk and some adjacent areas in Srinagar to maintain law and order. Shops and businesses were closed and vehicular traffic and pedestrian movement remained suspended in Srinagar.



In Hyderabad, a mood of mourning pervaded the old city areas. Cries of ""Ya Hussain, Ya Hussain"" rent the air as blood oozed out of the heads and chests of the bare-chested mourners.



In Lucknow, a large number of Shia Muslims, in black clothes, marched beating their chests and backs with chains and small knives to feel the same pain that, they believe, was felt by Hussain and his relatives.



It was during the month of Muharram in 680 AD that soldiers of the ruling caliph Yazid surrounded Hussain, his family and some of his followers at Karbala. In the days that followed, they were denied food and water and many of them were systematically killed.



Hussain was killed on the 10th day which is observed as the day of mourning.



On Muharram, considered a day of bereavement, Muslims observe voluntary fasts, give to charity and pray in remembrance of Hussain.



India has the third largest population of Muslims in the world, after Indonesia and Pakistan.","Tue, 06 Dec 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.deccanherald.com/sites/dh/files/article_images/2011/12/06/209740_thump.jpg,"['delhi', 'karbala', 'security', 'muharram', 'shia', 'mourning', 'day', 'muslims', 'taken', 'mark', 'masjid', 'hussain', 'indian', 'processions']", 
9,9,FL-2011-000196-IDN,"Thai Tiger officially and finally dropped, pressuring Tiger to look elsewhere for growth | CAPA - CAPA - Centre for Aviation",https://centreforaviation.com/analysis/reports/thai-tiger-officially-and-finally-dropped-pressuring-tiger-to-look-elsewhere-for-growth-64322,"Thai Airways, Tiger Airways and Ryanthai initially signed an MOU in Aug-2010 and a shareholders' agreement in Feb-2011 establishing Thai Tiger. But the proposed start-up has since endured multiple setbacks as it waited for Thai government approval that never eventuated.

Thai Tiger was all but dead in Sep-2011 when Thai Airways announced it would not extend the JV contract, which was due to expire in Oct-2011. Thai Airways executives have since repeatedly said it was no longer moving forward with Thai Tiger, which was to operate regional international routes following an ultra low-cost model, and was instead focusing on increasing its involvement in domestic LCC Nok Air and launching hybrid regional low-cost carrier Thai Smile.

Despite this, Tiger Airways refused to confirm the project was dead until this week, when the carrier finally put out a statement saying Tiger, Thai and Ryanthai ""have, today (7-Dec-2011), decided not to proceed with the incorporation of Thai Tiger"".

At its quarterly results presentation last month Tiger would not confirm it was ending its involvement in Thai Tiger. Tiger Group CEO Chin Yau Seng, as CAPA wrote last month, explained where Tiger stood on the Thai Tiger project after the JV contract expired:

""Subsequently we agreed to stay in touch and at some point meet and agree what to do with this project,” Mr Chin said. While Mr Chin did not say if Tiger had planned to hold conversations with Thai Airways during the past month, he said floods in Thailand had put pressure on Thai. “The last couple of weeks has been a very bad time for us to speak with Thai Airways,” Mr Chin said.

Thai Tiger was announced in Aug-2010 with a projected start date of early 2011, which repeatedly slipped as government officials questioned having a foreign carrier be a part-owner in a local carrier. Thai Tiger aimed to take a 10% market share handling 1 million-1.5 million passengers in its first year, launching operations with three to five A320s, expanding to 35 in five years. The delays allowed competitor Thai AirAsia to bolster its network in anticipation of Thai Tiger entering.

The proposed carrier would have resulted in some overlap within the Thai Airways group, whose carriers include partially owned domestic operator Nok and proposed startup Thai Smile, which Thai Airways plans to use to fend off growing competition from LCCs. Thai Smile will serve regional routes (leaving Thai Airways primarily with only medium- and long-haul routes) and have a cost base lower than Thai Airways but offer more service than pure LCCs, namely Thai AirAsia.

Thai Tiger would have operated several of the same routes as Thai Smile but following a pure no frills LCC model. Overlap with Nok was not expected as Thai Tiger was only intended to operate international routes.

This was the planned brand matrix and positioning of Thai Airways group carriers, including Thai Tiger:

Thai Airways has not yet explained how or if it will fill the ultra-LCC void in its matrix, although, as CAPA has mentioned, Thai Airways could look to more rapidly build up Thai Smile or have Nok Air expand into international markets. Nok is keen to remain at least for now as a pure domestic carrier. But Thai Airways, which in Oct-2011 increased its stake in Nok to 49% and now controls a majority of the seats on Nok's board, could drive a change in strategy at Nok.

See related article: Thailand's Nok Air to stick with domestic focus following ownership restructure and and fleet renewal

The bigger implications of Thai Tiger finally being withdrawn affect Tiger Airways.

Tiger in 2QFY12 (quarter ended 30-Sep-2011) reported a SGD12 million (USD9.3 million) loss for its Singapore operation, a sharp swing from the 2QFY11 profit of SGD6.8 million (USD5.3 million). As CAPA wrote earlier of the results:

Tiger in 2QFY2012 increased its number of flights by 57% with a 64% increase in capacity. Tiger traded yield for revenue, which increased 33%, and capacity outstripped demand. “We are gradually building up the demand,” CEO Chin Yau Seng said, adding low margins and poor performance were “because of that lag”. Load factors fell – across the group by 7.3 ppts – and was outmatched by a 64% increase in costs.

The drop in demand was despite prior comments from Mr Chin that ""Tiger Airways Singapore continues to see healthy demand."" Tiger's most recent traffic figures show a further 2.7ppt decline in load factors, suggesting demand and capacity will not find equilibrium this financial year.

Tiger also has stalled projects in Indonesia with Mandala Airlines and in the Philippines with SEAir. (While there were local reports that Tiger and SEAir received some regulatory clearance, competitor Cebu Pacific has disputed if the clearance will be final.) Tiger's excess capacity problem continues to be a threat as the JVs show no sign of progress. Tiger is committed to growing its fleet by four aircraft by Apr-2012, with another eight A320s to be added the following fiscal year.

10,10,FL-2011-000196-IDN,Climate Negotiations Fail to Keep Pace with Science - Scientific American,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-negotiations-fail/,"DURBAN, South Africa—By 2020, human activity could produce some 55 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases per year, up from roughly 36 billion metric tons currently. All the accumulating gas is enough to raise the global average temperatures by more than 3 degrees Celsius by century's end—more than triple the amount of warming that has already occurred. Emission reductions pledged under the 2010 Cancun Agreements, which cover some 85 percent of all national greenhouse gas emissions in the world, are meant to slow that warming. ""I think its safe to say the current commitment is scientifically sound,"" argued Xie Zhenhua, vice chairman of China's National Development and Reform Commission and lead climate envoy, in a press briefing here on December 6.

Most climate scientists, however, would beg to differ. The latest science suggests that international negotiations are proceeding far too slowly to have any significant impact on global warming and may well dawdle too long to prevent catastrophic climate change. To meet the international target of restraining the warming of global average temperatures to just 2 degrees Celsius will require greenhouse gas emissions of just 44 billion metric tons in 2020. And even that amount might not be enough: James Hansen of NASA said this week at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco that the 2 degrees C target ""is a prescription for disaster.""

What's happening is that research keeps finding new trouble signs. Thanks to a rebound in global economic activity, 2010 saw the biggest single year increase in emissions ever—5.9 percent higher to be exact, according to the World Meteorological Organization. Another analysis, published December 4 in Nature Geoscience, found that nearly all of the nearly 1 degree C warming observed over the last century or so could be attributed to human emissions of greenhouse gases. (Scientific American is part of Nature Publishing Group.) The U.K. Met Office stated in a December 5 report that as many as 49 million people could be at risk from increased coastal flooding because of climate change, and along with many others from a drop in the production of staple food crops. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) argues that emissions must be halved by mid-century to have any hope of restraining warming to 2 degrees C. ""After four rounds of IPCC reports, is the science not clear enough?"" asked Jato Sillah, Gambia's minister of forestry and environment during a speech on December 6.

""You can look at the science and see the trajectories, and it ought to inform what ought to be done. It might well cause us to say 'Gee, we need to do more'"" to meet a 2-degree C target, says U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern.

In fact, if the world does nothing about greenhouse gas emissions and continues growing at the present rate, Earth could warm by as much as 6 degrees C, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Implementing the Cancun Agreements, negotiated at last year's climate meeting, would bring that temperature rise down to 3.5 degrees C. But to hit the 2-degree C target, the energy sector would need to decrease CO2 output after its peak in 2020, explains Laura Cozzi, principal analyst in the office of the chief economist of the IEA. ""Oil demand and coal demand will have to go down from current levels.""

In other words, the world's present infrastructure—cars, power plants, steel mills and the like—already emits 80 percent of permissible greenhouse gas emissions, leaving essentially no room for growth after 2017. ""After that point, we will have to build [an] all-zero carbon infrastructure,"" Cozzi notes thanks to known amounts of oil, coal and natural gas that, if burned, would produce much more CO2 than would be consistent with greenhouse gas concentration target of 450 parts per million.

The alternative is more expensive. The IEA's latest World Energy Outlook notes that for every dollar not spent on emissions reductions in the next decade, an additional $4 would need to be spent after 2020 to compensate.

The challenge, however, may be less about slow-to-change infrastructure as about an expected lifestyle for Americans, Europeans, Japanese and, more recently, Chinese and Indians. ""There is a lock-in effect in terms of habits and lifestyles,"" such as driving cars and wasting electricity, notes economist Leena Srivastava of The Energy and Resources Institute in New Delhi. The resistance to changing a national lifestyle is perhaps best embodied by a statement from President George H.W. Bush back in 1992: ""The American way of life is not up for negotiation.""

In the U.S., change instead has focused on renewable sources of energy and improved efficiency, such as higher kilometers-per-gallon fuel standards for cars and trucks. ""We're about 6 percent below 2005 levels right now,"" says U.S. climate-change envoy Todd Stern, and committed to reducing 17 percent from that level by 2020. Still, the U.S. remains the world's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China.

Rising incomes around the world will make greenhouse reductions ever more challenging, and the latest data prove it: Developing countries such as China, India, Brazil and Indonesia now emit more in aggregate than developed countries, according to a study published December 4 in Nature Climate Change. ""In the next 10 years, our energy consumption will definitely still increase,"" says Liu Qiang of the Energy Research Institute in Beijing. ""That is our practical demand and a practical need,"" in China, particularly given the 128 million Chinese still living on $1 per day. Plus, for the growing Chinese middle class, ""it is not so easy to change the lifestyle,"" Qiang notes. The goal in China is to increase the share of renewables and nuclear generation to 15 percent of primary energy in the next decade, which will still leave coal and oil—and their attendant greenhouse gas emissions—the lion's share.

Fortunately, improving access for the roughly two billion people without modern energy could also help slow the momentum of climate change by reducing deforestation (done to obtain fuel wood) and cutting emissions of soot from cooking fires. ""We're all grappling with two defining challenges: overcoming inequality and climate change,"" observed economist Lord Nicholas Stern at the same event, dubbed ""Momentum for Change"" by the U.N. ""If we fail on one, we fail on the other.""","Wed, 07 Dec 2011 08:00:00 GMT",http://www.scientificamerican.com/themes/responsive/images/global/oglogo.png,"['climate', 'c', 'greenhouse', 'change', 'energy', 'emissions', 'world', 'fail', 'degrees', 'science', 'warming', 'pace', 'gas', 'negotiations']", 
11,11,FL-2011-000196-IDN,The politics behind the “fakeness” of textiles in Togo - How we made it in Africa,https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/the-politics-behind-the-%E2%80%9Cfakeness%E2%80%9D-of-textiles-in-togo/13637/,"Real Wax, Veritable Java Print, Guaranteed Dutch Java, Genuine Amsterdam, Vlisco True Original, Vlisco China, Vlisco Wax, African Printed Textiles, etc. These are some of the labels for modern wax print textiles (also known as batik) that are available in West African markets. But which one of the above is real, authentic or legal? And are the others then fake, inauthentic or illegal?

These are the questions posed by Professor Nina Sylvanus in her studies of wax print textiles in West Africa, and particularly Togo. And it is also in Togo that consumers are voicing a desire for the law to regulate the uncontrolled dumping of “fake” wax prints from China.

Many Africans would be surprised, maybe shocked, to learn that the fabric that they have always perceived to be truly African is not. Or is it? Who can claim intellectual property for this popular textile? To get to the bottom of this is not easy, and the story must be traced back centuries, across continents and shifting global politics.

***

Wax print is a process that traditionally uses a manual wax resistant dyeing technique. Melted wax is applied to cloth before being dipped in dye. The dye will not penetrate the areas that are covered with wax. Sometimes several colours are used, with a series of dyeing, drying and waxing steps. After the last dyeing, the fabric is hung up to dry. Then it is dipped in a solvent to remove the wax. A negative image of the printed pattern remains on the cloth.

The invention of the copper block revolutionised batik production. By using two deep engraved copper rollers, with the mirror image of the design, the two sides of the cotton fabric are printed with a pattern of melted wax. The fact that the cloth is printed on both sides enables the product to be worn on either side, which is an indication of a quality wax print. This intricate wax printing process results in the deep rich colours and the fine crinkle lines that give batik its unique character.

***

Although many trace the origin of wax prints to Indonesia and India, it is an ancient art form and already existed in Egypt in the 4th century BCE, where it was used to wrap mummies. In Asia, the technique was practiced in China, India and Japan since the 7th century. It is suggested that the fabrics were “reintroduced” into Africa by land across the trans-Saharan routes. In West Africa where fabrics already played an important role in their social life, local populations like the Yoruba in Nigeria, incorporated aspects of batik into their traditional textiles.

In Java, Indonesia, batik predates written records. It is not clear whether Indonesian batik is a native tradition or whether the technique might have been introduced during the 6th or 7th century from India or Sri Lanka. In the sixteenth century, the Dutch and the British trading companies established in West Java were presumably exposed to batik and soon started to sell wax prints (batiks) to West African markets that were enroute to Europe. In 1603, the first permanent Dutch trading post in Indonesia was established and for the next three hundred years, Java fell under the Dutch East Indies’ administration. Javanese batik was introduced to Holland and other parts of Europe, but was not popular with the Europeans.

After the mechanising of the textile industry during the Industrial Revolution (1760 onwards), the Dutch and the English blatantly copied the Javanese batik cloth (relabeled wax print) and industrialised the production techniques. These textiles were initially produced for the Dutch East Indies, but the local consumers were critical of the art and craftsmanship of the imported batik and it only found a market among the poor. However in Ghana and Togo, consumers embraced the slight imperfections that resulted from mechanical replication.

Earlier design used plants and animal motifs which had universal appeal. However, from the beginning of the 20th century design motifs were made more authentic by adding local patterns to cater to the tastes of their African customers. In the 1920s prints began to feature portraits of local community leaders and chiefs. After independence, 1950 onward, the portraits of African heads of states and prominent politicians were used as design motifs.

Early in the 20th century wealthy Togolese adopted the industrial copy (relabeled wax-print) and it became a status symbol. According to Professor Sylvanus, Togolese consumers distinguish between fabrics according to quality and origin. Togolese use the generic terms tschiganvo and tschivi. The former (tschiganvo) refers to superior and expensive wax printed cloth, also called grand pagne. By contrast, the term tschivi, refers to fabrics of inferior quality that is also considerably cheaper (petit pagne). The Dutch Vlisco cloth ranked highest, followed by English, Ivorian, Ghanaian and Nigerian wax-prints. Until the late 1990s, most Togolese women possessed a number of tschiganvo. In southern Togo, it has been a standard practice for a future husband to provide his bride with a selection of tschiganvo cloth – this is carefully evaluated by the bride’s family.

The Van Vlissingers that established today’s Vlisco brand, were early in the 1900s embroiled in a legal dispute over intellectual property (IP) rights. The Van Vlissingers bought the engraved rollers from a company in Haarlem and assumed that it would entitle them to design ownership. However they soon realised that the designs were still copied by a Manchester manufacturer. It was discovered that the Haarlem designs had during the early 1900s been registered in Britain. The Van Vlissingers could thus not claim exclusive property rights.

Dutch prints and Dutch brands have dominated the West African market since the end of the 19th century. The Dutch brand Vlisco is a symbol of class and on par with luxury brands like Rolex or Louis Vuitton.

Up until the 1960s, most wax prints sold in West Africa were being produced in Europe. Post-colonially, things changed. Currently, Ghana is home to several fine and high quality wax print manufacturers including Woodin, a subsidiary of Holland’s Vlisco and ATL which is a subsidiary of Manchester-based ABC textiles. Even though these textiles are now manufactured on the continent, the companies that manufacture them are for the most part not owned by Africans.

In the 1970s, Togo was known as the centre of commerce in West Africa. It was West Africa’s “petite Suisse” (little Switzerland), because of its apparent stability and prosperity. Professor Sylvanus suggests that this label of stability was false since political and economic governance was not really taken into consideration. With the Cold War as background, portraying this stability would encourage Western aid that would again prevent Russia from entering the country.

From the late 1950s Togolese women entrepreneurs known as “Nana Benz” ( “Nana” stands for mother or elder woman, “Benz” stands for Mercedes Benz, the German cars that they were the first to import), took control over the imported wax print market. They positioned Lomé, Togo’s capital, into a regional centre of textile distribution and dominated the trade in wax prints from Holland, Belgium, France and England, for the export markets in West Africa. Between 1976 and 1984, at least 40% of the commercial business in Togo which was in the informal sector, was in the hands of the Nana Benz. During the 1970s, the scope of this trade in textile was so important that it exceeded Togo’s phosphate industry, the country’s primary source of revenue.

The Nana Benz rose in wealth and power. Though uneducated, they travelled abroad on business, and commanded spontaneous salutes from the police at state functions. Even the government used to borrow their Mercedes Benzes for important state functions. They also played a leading role in national politics under the one-party rule of the Rassemblement du Peuple Togolaise (RPT). President Gnassingbe Eyadéma, appointed them to high offices in the women’s wing of the RPT. A leading Nana Benz, Madame A. Amedome, was appointed Minister of Social Welfare in 1977 even though she could not read or write.

In the late 1980s, after the Washington Consensus, international financial institutions changed their agenda from development economics to market reform. This was accompanied by an appeal for “democratisation”. In Togo the period between 1989 and 1993 was notable by violent agitation for a multi-party democracy. The controversial presidential election in 1993 was followed by a series of strikes and violent street protests. As Togo’s reputation of political and economic stability vanished, the European Union withdrew its support. This was followed by foreign investors and companies that also abandoned Togo.

These also signaled and end of a period of political and economic privileges for the Nana Benz. They lost their monopoly over the very profitable wax print market, partially because of the restructuring of their European suppliers and the devaluation of the Togolese currency, CFA Franc, by 50% that made this luxury item a commodity only affordable to the elite. But China also entered the market . . .

***

After the withdrawal of European aid the Togolese government used the Lomé free trade zone as a courting strategy for Chinese investments and development aid. While “official” customs regulations (amounting to 53%) were applied to European imports to fill the (empty) national treasury, a lax regulatory regime was used for Chinese imports. In opening the nation’s vast entrepôt (a port to which goods are brought for import and export) to Chinese products, the small West African nation became a major hub for mass-produced counterfeits of popular consumer goods, which included wax prints.

However before the arrival of China, Togolese traders have ventured to India, Hong Kong and then to China to find textile manufacturers to produce more affordable wax prints. These were labeled “Supersoso” and eventually also “Vlisco”, a clear “fake” of the Dutch brand. Thus, African traders had a role to play in introducing Chinese manufacturers into the African textile market.

Eyadéma died in 2005, and was succeeded by Faure Gnassingbé. Laissez-faire governance was accompanied by quasi-suspended economic regulations. This led to even more uncertainty. The state’s retreat from market regulation provided fortunes to some – especially the extended family clan. According to Professor Sylvanus, this can be illustrated, when in 2007 a “faction of the extended family firm”, after a huge publicity campaign launched a new fabric brand, Wax Nana Benz. They used the branding of the Nana Benz image as a symbol of the “stability” of an era when Togo was a prospering nation. Wax Nana Benz designs, identical copies of Dutch designs, were not subject to IP regulation as it was interpreted as national intellectual property. Wax Nana Benz did not hide that it was produced in China. Initially this product did well since Togolese bought into the quasi-authenticity, and it was cheaper and of a good quality. But soon the quality began to decline and the price increased. Consumers realised that Wax Nana Benz was nothing but a copy of a copy, produced in the same factory by the same Chinese suppliers that were flooding the market with cheap copies, just under a different label.

With Dutch wax prints being increasingly reproduced in China, wax prints carrying the “Made in Holland” tag are at the high end of the market, with Chinese productions occupying the opposite end. As the quality of Chinese wax print copies are improving consumers are increasingly unable to distinguish between all the different types and qualities of fabrics. In joining Western fears over China’s aggressive economic policy, Togolese citizens want the regulation of the textile industry and demand state intervention. Togo not only nominally acknowledges international IP law (via its WTO membership), is a member of the Cameroon-based African Intellectual Property Organisation, but also has a national IP legislation. The state, however, is reluctant to intervene and appear to deliberately remain ambiguous as presidential delegations make repeated trips to Beijing actively courting Chinese development aid.

***

Indian batiks were brought “back” to West Africa by land. After colonisation the Dutch brought Indonesian batik to Africa and later copied it for production by their factories in Holland. They integrated the wax prints by incorporating African designs and claimed the “Dutch wax print” to be “authentically African” even though it was produced and designed in Europe, presumably by Europeans with little or no African input in terms of designs and motifs at the production stages. The Dutch wax print industry flourished under the protection of Western powers. This monopoly was brought to an end by the shifting of global politics. The withdrawal of the EU in Togo left the door open for China who enthusiastically stepped in and copied the Dutch wax prints that were already a copy of . . .

Should the Togolese government claim wax prints to be African/Togolese IP due to its “Africanness” and protect it against the “fakeness” of the Chinese products?

12,12,FL-2011-000196-IDN,Violent eviction in Santo Domingo leaves scores living in a tent - Amnesty International,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2011/11/violent-eviction-santo-domingo-leaves-scores-living-tent/,"On Saturday, 15 October 2011, Jodis Encarnación and his wife woke up, as they do every day, at 7am. Just like any other day, they got the children up and ready and they drove them to Jodis’ mother’s house on their way to work in the outskirts of Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. But as his shift as a taxi driver was only starting, Jodis received a desperate call from a neighbour. “The police are here, with bulldozers, they are knocking down all the houses,” the neighbour said. The car journey back to Alto Brisas del Este, the community where Jodis lives, took him 15 minutes but by the time he arrived, his home was gone and with it, everything his family owned. In its place, there was only a pile of rubble. “Our house was completely destroyed, there was nothing left. We were not even able to save a spoon, nothing,” Jodis told an Amnesty International team in Alto Brisas. Jodis’ family is one of 72 who were violently evicted, without judicial order, by 300 police and military personnel. Video taken by community residents on the day of the eviction shows police and military officers, together with representatives from the local Mayor’s office taking away mattresses, fridges and clothes, and tractors knocking down the fragile stone and wood houses. Eyewitnesses also said police and soldiers fired buckshot and teargas into the families’ houses to force them out. Police said one officer and one tractor driver were hurt by gun shots, but the circumstances surrounding this incident are still unclear. In only a few hours, there was nothing more than a pile of rubble left in Alto Brisas del Este. When the police arrived that morning, 28-year-old Jenny Pérez was alone at home. She said police threw a tear gas grenade inside her house, forcing her to leave by the back door. Jenny then saw police officers rushing into her home and her beauty salon next door, taking whatever few possessions she had and destroying her means of living.“They saw I’m pregnant and one police officer said ‘turn around if you don’t want to get a bullet in your head’.” “They didn’t even give a few minutes warning, they didn’t even give us a few minutes to get our things, they just came in. They came in and took my husband’s graduation ring, clothes, everything they could carry in their bags,” she told an Amnesty International team. Even though Jenny and her husband now live in a rented house, they are still dealing with the physical and psychological consequences of the violent eviction and of having lost everything. But they are some of the lucky ones. Since the eviction, dozens of families from Alto Brisas del Este were forced to set up camp in a tent on a nearby street.More than 25 children, women and men live and sleep in the tent, which has little more than a couple of mattresses and an old couch that one family managed to save. “When it rains, the street becomes flooded and so does the tent. The children sleep in mattresses and many of us adults sleep on chairs or even on cardboard on the floor,” said one woman while she cooked dinner for the group. Where their homes used to be, a small police unit was installed. Community members say that, even after the eviction, they have been threatened and attacked. They say that as recently as 26 October, police officers fired a teargas canister into their makeshift camp to warn them off returning to the land where their homes used to be. The community was originally set up over a decade ago on privately owned land, with, they say, the permission of the owner. However, in 1992, the area was declared to be of “public utility” by a presidential decree and in May that year, 19 families were forcibly evicted.It is unclear what the Alto Brisas del Este lands are going to be used for.Community members said they think the land will be used for a tourism-related development, while the Mayor of Santo Domingo del Este publicly stated that local authorities are now planning to plant trees in the area and create a natural protected area.Local organizations say the judicial process that followed and led to the most recent mass eviction failed to respect administrative procedures to carry out evictions in the Dominican Republic.The final eviction was carried out despite a pending court protection order that would have temporarily prevented it from taking place.National and local authorities have so far failed to help the community or provide alternative accommodation. On 27 October, Juan de los Santos, the Mayor of Santo Domingo del Este said local authorities will not give any compensation or alternative accommodation to the evicted families.Forced evictions such as this one are common in the Dominican Republic. In 2011 alone, and according to a local organization working on the housing issue, more than 100 communities were forcibly evicted from the lands they lived on across the Caribbean nation.Most evictions are executed without due process or consultation with the communities affected, to make lands available for the construction of infrastructure, tourism or industry. It is estimated that more than 50 per cent of the population in the Dominican Republic lack security of tenure (75 per cent in Santo Domingo Province) and are effectively at risk of forced evictions. This is an argument used by the local authorities to justify their actions. According to a report recently published by Amnesty International, police violence and excessive use of force during evictions and public demonstrations are common in the Dominican Republic. In 2010, 977 people were injured by the police in the Dominican Republic, according to the Office of the Prosecutor General. Amnesty International also received reports of excessive use of force and inappropriate use of firearms by police officers during public demonstrations. Recently Amnesty International’s delegates in the Dominican Republic received the testimony of a student who was shot in her leg by police officers using live ammunition during a protest at the Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo. The organization also expressed concern at the decision taken by the Dominican authorities in early October to send military personnel to patrol jointly with police officers in order to fight crime and during evictions such as in Alto Brisa del Este. “Military officers are not trained to patrol streets for crime prevention and are using firearms which are not adequate for that purpose. That decision could lead to excessive use of force and exacerbate human rights abuses by public security personnel in the Dominican Republic,” said Javier Zuñiga, Special Advisor at Amnesty International.“We are not criminals. All we want is to live in peace and work. We deserve to live with dignity. We want to see justice and see our conditions improved, we are living in inhuman conditions,” said Jodis, from the tent that is now his home.","Mon, 28 Nov 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://aineupstrmediaprd.blob.core.windows.net:443/media/4410/dominicanrep-alto-brisas-del-este-281111.jpg?preset=fixed_1200_630,"['tent', 'este', 'eviction', 'del', 'jodis', 'amnesty', 'living', 'local', 'dominican', 'republic', 'santo', 'violent', 'officers', 'scores', 'domingo', 'evictions', 'leaves']",

The rhythmic reptiles are proving themselves to be little John Travoltas with their dazzling dance routines.



Owner Shikhei Goh photographed the creatures after buying them from a pet shop and getting them home.

He placed them on a reflective surface and watched as they got a bit excited and started lashing out with their arms and legs and shaking their bootie.



Their actions mimicked a series of funky disco moves similar to those seen on the film Saturday Night Fever.

One hilarious image shows a gecko striking a legendary Travolta pose with one of its arms in the air while another is of a reptile doing a 'kung-fu fighting' cameo.



Shikhei, 37, uploaded the pictures onto the internet and now thousands of people from around the world have viewed them.

Shikhei, from Indonesia, said: 'I mostly photograph insects but then I bought the geckos and decided to take some pictures.



'These geckos come from Pakistan and these three were difficult to picture because they kept moving.



'But it did look like they were dancing and one shot looks as if one is doing a kung-fu kick.

'Difficult to Overstate the Gravity of This Moment': UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon

Nature's Edge Notebook - Durban Diary #2

DURBAN, South Africa - UNFCCC/COP-17 (The UN's annual global summit on global warming.)

At this huddle of humans from around the globe trying to deal with the great climate problem they've caused (but that nobody meant to happen) you're pelted by a steady barrage of beautiful ideas, terrible worries, dark failures and bright successes.

You pick up hope in sparkling pieces, and desperate struggle in every other anecdote.

Here's a quick list of nine selected bits and scenes this reporter has encountered so far.

They began as soon as we got off the plane at the Durban airport and shared a taxi with a coordinator of research at Sweden's Upsalla University.

1.

All packed in together as our cheerful cabbie took us through rolling South African hills toward the shore of the Indian Ocean, we listened as Carmen Medina, a specialist in clean energy, told us that for five years now, an entire village near Lysekil, Sweden, has drawn all the electricity it needs from the waves just offshore.

Generators are run by underwater canisters that bob up and down on the constant surging swells. This pilot project, she reports, has proven to need little maintenance and has ""small ecological impact and relative inconspicuousness in the scenery,"" as she wrote later in an email that included links to technical websites like www.el.angstrom.uu.se/, which has graphics in color and words in Swedish.

The constant exchange of information, verbal and graphic, by electronic pocket gadgets is a leitmotif of this convention of hopeful problem solvers.

2.

Wake-up tea at the hotel next morning was accompanied by heart-wrenching news on TV of severe drought around Kenya's Lake Turkana. The ancient way of life there has already been decimated by a lengthening and deepening drought. Famed paleontologist Richard Leakey remarks in the report that the early humans whose bones were found there also had to struggle with natural climate change. The reporter said scientists believe the current unnatural climate change is coming far faster than our antecedents ever had to deal with, at a speed impossible for many farmers now to keep up with, so they've left, searching for a living somewhere else.

3.

On the car radio as we drive along the shore to the Convention Center with a dozen big ships bobbing at anchor out in the sunlight waiting to unload at Durban's port, a commentator says, ""What we need fundamentally is a price on carbon - it would create the pressures of market scarcity and start to drive a meaningful carbon market."" The goal of having a worldwide ""closed loop"" on a price for carbon emissions still eludes the negotiators at these global climate summits.

Any global agreement to make it ""no longer free to put carbon in the air"" still appears years off. Negotiators here from major carbon emitting nations talk of 2015 or 2020 before there's a binding agreement.

4.

On the Convention Center's bright and airy curving mezzanine balcony where hundreds of journalists from around the world, thinking in dozens of languages, work at their keyboards in the most pleasant ""Press Room"" I've ever known, I pick up some illuminating news from Jamaica, the island nation just off the southeast corner of my own, the United States.

At the computer terminal to my left, Carol Francis, the quiet and business-like Programmes Manager for RJR Cable Jamaica, tells me her compatriots take manmade global warming seriously because of sea level rise, present and imminent.

""Our beaches are going,"" she says. ""In Negril, some hotels are already sandbagging the beaches to try to maintain them.""

When, mindful of the many flat ""small island nations"" now facing total obliteration beneath the rising waves in coming decades, I say that ""At least your country has some mountains,' she responds with quiet shock.

""Most of our infrastructure is on the coast - Kingston, our capital, and hotels, airports, towns,"" she says.

She begins to tell me of specific ""projections"" that are circulating among businesses in Jamaica for when, within 30 or 40 years, large scale migrations must be under way going inland, upslope, or, she half-jokes, ""maybe we'll come knocking on your door in America.""

5.

Later, some surprising good news about deforestation of the Amazon from the U.S. correspondent for the journal Nature, Jeff Tollefson, who briefly uses the same computer terminal on my left. The annual rate at which the Amazonian jungle is being cut down has reached an all-time low.

""It may be one of the most successful conservation stories we've seen… if it continues,"" he says, and shows me a graph of satellite data he says is trusted by scientists. ""This success makes a huge difference in Brazil's carbon emissions, as well as in protecting biodiversity."" he says. Deforestation releases vast amounts of long-stored carbon gases.

""It's getting harder to believe this is not partly because of a serious commitment by the Brazilian government to stop deforestation,"" Tollefson tells me, referring to the skepticism with which scientists met earlier claims by Brazil of declining rates.

Half an hour later, when I come back from doing a few quick interviews, Tollefson has already posted his news on the Nature News Blog for the world to read. The dramatic graph based on the satellite data explains itself, the words are in Portuguese, but will eventually be available also in English on the World Wide Web.

6.

U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon suddenly appears on the large monitors scattered around the convention center. He's over in the immense assembly hall, opening the high level plenary segment of this conference.

First, he says what everyone here is thinking: ""The ultimate goal of a comprehensive and binding climate change agreement may be beyond our reach - for now.""

Then he delivers a forceful speech underscoring the sense of current negotiations - that pragmatic solid steps are building the basis of such an agreement within a few years.

""It would be difficult to overstate the gravity of this moment,"" he declares.

""Without exaggeration, we can say the future of our planet is at stake - people's lives, the health of global economy … the very survival of some nations,"" he says.

""The science is clear,"" he says. ""The World Meteorological Organization has reported that carbon emissions are at their highest in history and rising. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tells us, unequivocally, that greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced by half by 2050 if we are to keep the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees (centigrade) since pre-industrial times.""

Those standing around the monitors and listening closely scribble a few notes and go back to work.

Reports leaking out of negotiations for the past few days have spoken of China and Europe being the leaders, the pace setters, in figuring out how the world might manage all this.

Chinese negotiators have made public statements that they may soon be ready to commit to absolute carbon limits (as opposed to emissions reductions only as a percentage of their GDP) which they have never done before.

It is also widely known now that the China is aiming for primacy in carbon-free high-tech and energy production.

The United States has lost prestige as a leader in the fight to curb manmade global warming ever since Congress voted down legislation a year ago that would have put limits on carbon emissions.

Achim Steiner, executive director of the U.N. Environmental Programme has recently gone on the record with ABC News saying that the European Union is now tending instead ""to look east - including to China"" in calculating how productive competitive carbon markets and other climate policy may be shaped.

7.

I make a first visit to some of the many booths and displays set up here by different non-governmental organizations and nations.

Within a few minutes I speak to representatives of Japan, Ukraine, Malawi, Bangladesh and Malaysia, and learn once again that each nation has its own problems, prospects and contributions in facing the fast-growing climate crisis:

Japan operates the only orbiting satellite now monitoring the carbon dioxide emission down on earth - the polar-orbiting GOSAT, relied on by all nations. (The rocket carrying a similar satellite launched by NASA a few years ago failed to achieve orbit.) Japan also has the world's oldest forestry preservation program, begun 1300 years ago, and is now advising Indonesia in land-use and forestry management. Indonesia is the world's third largest greenhouse gas emitter because of deforestation and the draining of wetlands for agricultural use.

Ukraine is still burdened with obsolete machinery from USSR days, and so is focusing on improving energy efficiency as the first and most obvious way to cut its carbon footprint and save money.

In Malawi, severe drought is persisting. The old climate cycles that have brought relief in the past seem out of whack.

The first sentence of an ""Information Brief"" flyer for low-lying Bangladesh is stunning in its concision of suffering: ""The direct impacts of climate change on industry are mainly instantaneous damage, through flooding and cyclones, and secondly damage over time, through increased salinity and loss of land."" Bangladesh is a country inured to such disasters and has been newly assured by the world's climate scientists that they will now come with increasing frequency.

Malaysia is proud that almost all of its new and lucrative palm oil agriculture has been established on already cleared land, much of it former rubber plantations. Malaysia's pledge at the Rio global environment conference 20 years ago was to keep 50 percent of its land forested. Currently it's at 62 percent.

8.

At a late afternoon event held in the immense plenary hall and sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon introduces a program moderated by British economist Lord Nicholas Stern. It launches the ""Momentum for Change Initiative"" celebrating the example of 10 programs produced by public-private partnerships that help people manage climate change - new means of illuminating houses without electricity by funneling sunlight indoors using discarded plastic bottles; new designs and programs to help capture rainwater; new insurance schemes for farmers that kick in whenever the temperature goes above a certain point, thus predicting drought; new micro-credit for putting more solar panels in villages.

9.

Amidst the surging crowds of journalists on deadlines, delegates on orders, and activists on missions, this reporter feels the need for a hot chocolate… and walks over to the nearby mezzanine cafe with its pleasant outdoor terrace. The building is still abuzz with ""side events"" by organizations from around the world, displaying new ideas.

Sipping the frothy brew out on the terrace in the twilight as I look down on the gaggles of people talking, explaining, pondering, and writing, I recall a comment I first heard from climate scientist Richard Somerville some seven years ago when I first started focusing on the global warming story.

""Remember,"" said Somerville, ""Mother Nature always bats last.""

I reflect, in the cooling dusk, that in this deadly game, it now feels like we're already somewhere in the middle innings.","Wed, 07 Dec 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://s.abcnews.com/favicon.ico,"['climate', 'nations', 'scenes', 'change', 'grave', 'world', 'emissions', 'ago', 'scientists', 'huddle', 'satellite', 'global', 'crisis', 'carbon', 'bits']", 
28,28,FL-2011-000196-IDN,The Washington That Wasn't « Ted Landphair's America - Voice of America,https://blogs.voanews.com/tedlandphairsamerica/2011/12/08/the-washington-that-wasnt/,"Most museum exhibits are about things that are, were, might be down the road, or are just imagined.

But I just toured a yeasty one about things that very well could have been but never were.

It’s Unbuilt Washington, a new exhibit at the National Building Museum that will run through May 28th next year.

Possibly you’ve passed by our capital city’s iconic buildings and memorials. Or almost surely seen fetching photos of the White House; the U.S. Capitol; the Washington Monument obelisk; memorials to notable presidents; and the grand museums that line the vast National Mall. They are idealized, and realized, visions that have come to symbolize American democracy.

But Unbuilt Washington points out that vastly different structures — some even grander, others kind of kooky — were in the running for these and other treasured places. And, in three or four rooms, it displays the sketches and plans and models to prove it.

A huge statue of George Washington, for instance, right atop the partially completed Washington Monument, which had sat as an ugly stub on the National Mall for more than 20 years in the 19th century.

And a walking bridge across an inlet of the Potomac River, complete with shops and outdoor cafes, looking a lot like Florence’s Ponte Vecchio — or a gaudy Atlantic City ocean pier, depending upon your point of view.

And a “National Sofa” just outside the White House!

Yes, a National Sofa! I’ll tell you about it in a bit.

Would Parisians feel as passionate about a modernist spiral as they do about the Eiffel Tower?

And would a tiered pyramid be as evocative to Americans as the Abraham Lincoln figure that gazes between majestic pillars down the Mall? It’s hard for me to imagine that it would, since a standing figure of Lincoln was planned as what one Web site called the “cake topper” at the pinnacle of the proposed stepped pyramid.

Would we have gotten used to a span of London Bridge proportions, complete with Tower of London-sized turrets and castles, where the low, dignified Memorial Bridge crosses over to Arlington National Cemetery? It certainly would have been way out of scale with what’s around it.

The building museum’s senior vice president, Martin Moeller, Jr., himself a noted architect who took great delight in curating the Unbuilt Washington exhibit, told me that there are a dozen good reasons why some of these schemes for updating the capital never got built.

Some were beaten out by other plans in design competitions, or quashed by the many arts commissions that pass judgment on public-building design around here. Sometimes money ran short before construction could start. Wars and depressions thwarted others. Local outrage smote projects such as the proposed Capitol Hill Expressway that would have thrust two elevated freeways right through the monumental core of the city.

And some plans were viewed as simply too frilly, not frilly enough, or even “too French.” “Yeah, there was heavy French envy for awhile,” Moeller confirmed.

Sometimes the families or descendants of the intended memorial honorees objected, even to plans that had been approved. Take the original design for the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial along the Tidal Basin of the Potomac River, okayed in 1964. It visualized a series of tall, closely bunched slabs, rising as high as 57 meters into the air. The Roosevelt family and others squelched this idea as too competitive with the nearby Washington Monument and not in keeping with Roosevelt’s desire for a modest memorial, “no bigger than this desk [to which he pointed]” if one was to be built at all.

Indeed, Roosevelt’s only memorial for half a century was a small marker outside the National Archives on Pennsylvania Avenue. What was eventually built was a series of outdoor “rooms” full of statues of FDR, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, Depression-era workers in a breadline, and even Roosevelt’s dog, Fala; plus lots of Roosevelt quotes and a quiet, cascading waterfall.

As you might imagine, there are juicy stories to go with the sketches and models of unrealized architectural dreams on display at the National Building Museum. I particularly enjoyed these:

• In anticipation of the city’s bicentennial in 2000, the Museum of Modern Art in New York commissioned Luxembourg-based urban planner Léon Krier to devise a master plan for a new and better Washington. This was obviously hypothetical, and it’s a good thing, I can say from my writing perch right across from the Washington Mall: Krier’s plan, if miraculously executed, would not only have FLOODED much of the Mall, turning it into some sort of futuristic Venetian canal, it also would have leveled many outsized federal buildings (such as our 1942-vintage rockpile of a bureaucratic fortress) in favor of pleasant mixed-use neighborhoods.

• In the first few years of the 20th Century, Washington got an amazing facelift, thanks to something called the McMillan Commission, details of which would bore you. It involved master architect Daniel Burnham, the impresario of the amazing World’s Columbian Exposition, almost a decade earlier in Chicago. That “Great White City” of temporary fair buildings inspired an entire “City Beautiful” movement across the country, including the nation’s capital. And a few years later, a notorious precinct of taverns and gambling halls called “Murder Bay,” as well as adjacent neighborhoods along Pennsylvania Avenue, were replaced by the Federal Triangle complex of neoclassical government buildings.

But that’s not the story. This burnishing of the grandeur of Washington may also have been influenced by what most people now view as a crackpot idea a year or two earlier.

In 1900, Franklin W. Smith, a Boston hardware merchant with interest but no expertise in architecture — and no previous connection to the national capital — dreamed up the idea for what he called the “aggrandizement of Washington.” He meant this as a positive.

Concerned that the United States lagged behind other “civilized” nations in cultural development, he proposed a huge complex of art and history museums spanning 25 hectares in “Foggy Bottom,” very near the present location of George Washington University.

Smith even opened a storefront on K Street in which he proudly showed passersby a model of this cultural enclave. Amazingly, the plan made it as far as the U.S. Senate, which instructed the Government Printing Office to produce an entire book about it. But nothing came of Smith’s dream.

• Around the same time, Mary Foote Henderson, the wife of the former U.S. senator who had written the constitutional amendment that banned slavery, was building quite a little real-estate empire on 16th Street, just above the original core of designer Pierre L’Enfant’s Plan of Washington. Many mansions, including the city’s first “embassy row,” were built along this corridor.

But Henderson had even bigger ideas. She pushed for a palatial executive mansion — a White House on steroids — high on a promontory in what later became Meridian Hill Park. It was probably no coincidence that the Hendersons lived right across 16th Street from this location. Admittedly, the president’s house had grown a bit cramped at a time when the nation was flexing its muscles throughout the world and the executive branch was growing.

But Congress, in no mood to elevate the president’s importance, paid Henderson’s lofty presidential palace idea no mind.

• In 1922, Daisy Calhoun, the wife of a prominent Washington lawyer, founded The Woman’s Universal Alliance expressly for the purpose of building a memorial to mothers that would “proclaim the debt each mortal owes to the woman who risked her own life to give life.” Several designs were advanced, including one by Joseph Geddes that Martin Moeller calls “sturdy and stern,” for a site near the Naval Observatory. But Daisy Calhoun was unable to raise the funds to build this Monument to Moms.

• And then there’s the National Sofa! This was the idea advanced by architects Doug Michels and Jim Allegro when a block of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House was ordered closed to vehicular traffic during a domestic-terrorism scare that followed the 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma.

The architects proposed an “interactive monument” in which citizens could lounge on a long, marble sofa and have occasional, real-time conversations with the First Family across the White House fence via a giant video screen. It wasn’t as obtrusive as it sounds. The screen would have risen from the earth and then retract when not in use.

According to the National Building Museum’s exhibit notes, “The proposal was simultaneously an idealistic vision for a truly democratic forum — allowing informal dialogue between citizens and their leaders — and a wry commentary on sedentary American lifestyles.”

There were many other wild and wacky — or perhaps overblown or overly idealistic — plans left unbuilt in “the Capital of the Free World.”

Among them:

• Architect Michels’ idea, in the late 1980s, for a “Dolphin America” hotel. Michels was fascinated with these ocean mammals. He believed that humans underestimated their intelligence, and he even conceived of a joint human/dolphin colony in outer space. He spotted a site on Massachusetts Avenue, roughly between the U.S. Capitol and the White House, for what he envisioned as a complex that would include a hotel, museum, health club, and research lab.

But for one reason or another, Michels never pursued funding, and Dolphin America never came up for air.

• Early plans for a standalone Library of Congress, which had outgrown its home inside the U.S. Capitol after passage of the Copyright Act of 1870. That law required the library to accept two copies of each book submitted for copyright protection. One of the proposals envisioned an ornate cathedral-like structure so gargantuan that was eventually rejected, in part, because it would have overshadowed the Capitol itself, next door.

What was eventually approved and then completed in 1897 — an Italian Renaissance charmer of a building with a distinctive copper dome — is one of my favorite landmarks in Washington.

• And legendary modern architect Frank Lloyd Wright’s designs for “Crystal Heights,” a shimmering, glass-shrouded apartment complex on Connecticut Avenue. Never materialized.

The last piece of the Unbuilt Washington exhibit that visitors encounter is an illustration of a new idea for the National Building Museum itself.

That museum, you should know, is housed in a glorious space: the old Pension Building. It was constructed between 1882 and 1887 to house the U.S. Pension Bureau, a Federal agency created to award pensions to Union veterans of the U.S. Civil War of the 1860s and any vets still living from earlier wars. The red-brick, Italian Renaissance Revival building takes up a full block in Washington’s Judiciary Square neighborhood. The roof of the four-story Great Hall is supported by colossal Corinthian columns that are among the tallest interior pillars in the world. That atrium is a favorite site for important parties, including presidential inaugural balls.

British architect James Eyre has come up with plans for a temporary installation — a “tensegrity bridge” — over the building’s vast open space.

It’s an idea, borrowed from futurist inventor and designer Buckminster Fuller, for a glass bridge that would look fragile, unsupportable, even gossamer-like, across which people would walk as light pulsed according to their steps.

This is one idea that the building museum hopes will NOT go unbuilt if the money can be found to create it.

And I’ll close with one more drawing, by none other than Thomas Jefferson. It’s his plan for the president’s residence, and a rather humble one at that. He would eventually live in the president’s dwelling, but it was larger, finer, and whiter!

29,29,FL-2011-000196-IDN,Originality vs Nationality: Afri-centic Analysis - Trinidad and Tobago News,http://www.trinidadandtobagonews.com/blog/?p=5919,"By Dr. Kwame Nantambu

December 05, 2011

As the UN-sponsored “International Year for People of African Descent” (2011) gradually comes to an end, historiography suggests that African people must deal with these fundamental questions: “Who am I here and now?; Am I all I can be?”, Am I really who i am? (and) Why am I here?”



In this specific regard, people of African descent need to confront the issues of originality versus nationality. For “a people limited in their view point and without a collective vision going into the 21st century will, indeed perish.”

As deceased Afri-centric African-American scholar/historian Dr. John Henrik Clarke opines: “There is no solution for African people, except for some form of Pan African Nationalism, no matter how you cut it. No matter what island you’re from, no matter what state you’re from, no matter what religion you belong to, we must develop a concept of Pan African Nationalism that cuts across all religious, political, social, fraternity ,sorority lines and allows us to proudly face the world as one people.”

And as the deceased African-Trinbagonian Pan-Africanist Kwame Ture once warned: “If you don’t know who you are, you would not know what your interests are.”

The fact of the matter is that a people without a sense of history are ill-equipped to visualize and plan a future because of an unclear and distorted/mis-educated picture of their past. A people without the knowledge of “having done” will have grave difficulty acknowledging the motivation of “can do.”

In essence, originality refers to our inherited Africanness; it is a gift from Mother Africa – “the cradle of civilization.” It also represents 99.9 per cent of the totality of the history of African people on the planet.

On the other hand, nationality is an accident of birth as a direct result of the European enslavement of African people or the European slave trade. It represents an indictment from Father Europe. It also represents only 0.1 per cent of the totality of the history of African people on the planet.

In other words, the only reason why Africans here are Trinbagonians is simply because their European slave ship landed and unloaded their forefathers on the plantations in Trinidad and Tobago. That’s it. Ergo, their nationality is a mere accident because if their European slave ship had landed and unloaded their forefathers on plantations in another Caribbean country, then, they would have a different nationality today.

The stark historical reality is that Africa is our Home, our Originality; Trinidad and Tobago is our Destination, our Nationality. As such, the descendants of our African forefathers are African-Trinbagonians, period. The ahistorical, Euro-centric label “Afro-Trinbagonian” does not apply. It does not even compute. We are Africans, period.

Our African forefathers were brought from the Continent of Africa. According to the annals of world history, there has never been a Continent named “Afro” or Afro-Land. We are Africans first—our Orignality, then, we have been transformed into being Trinbagonians, Jamaicans, Cubans, Brazilians, etc, by accident— our Nationality.

The truth be told: In the B.C. era of Originality, Africans were powerful and Europeans were powerless. Africa ( as in ancient Kemet/Egypt) was the Subject of world history while Europe was the Object of world history. Conversely, in the A.D. era of Nationality, Africans are powerless and Europeans are powerful. Africa is the Object of world history while Europe is now the Subject of world history. Furthermore, as “part of the manifestation of the evil genius of Europe”, for the past five hundred years and counting, world scholarship, albeit Euro-centric global mis-education, has been governed by His-Story.

Nevertheless, as the Afri-centric African-American scholar/historian Dr. Marimba Ani correctly admonishes :”You’re not an African because you’re born in Africa. You’re an African because Africa is born in you. It’s in your genes, your DNA, your entire biological make-up. Whether you like it or not, that’s the way it is. Indeed, if [African-Trinbagonians] were to embrace this truth with open arms my, my, my what a wonderful thing [that would be].”

In the final analysis, it is to be hoped that the descendants of those Africans who were enslaved on the plantations in Trinidad and Tobago would internalize their Africanness and begin to refer to themselves as African-Trinbagonian from 2012, ad infinitum. If this Afri-centric turnabout does not become a reality, then, the celebration of 2011 as the “International Year for People of African Descent” would just tantamount to a colossal exercise in historical-ancestral futility.

As the adage strongly asserts, whatever “circumscribes the circumference of your mind, controls the diameter of your thinking.” Now is the time for African- Trinbagonians to think, act and live out Africa, 24-7-365.

“When a woman is the sum total of her headscarf and hymen – that is, what’s on her head and what is between her legs – then nakedness and sex become weapons of political resistance.”

This comes from a powerful essay by Mona Eltahawy in the Guardian, called “ Egypt’s Naked Blogger is a Bomb Aimed at the Patriarchs in Our Mind ” (Eltahawy was recently sexually assaulted and beaten by police in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, her left hand and right arm broken by the force of their blows).The background is that a young woman blogger in Egypt posted a photograph of herself, naked , as a symbol of resistance against the patriarchal conservative forces that are threatening to overwhelm Egypt in the post-Mubarak era.The response has been incendiary; read it for yourself. But it proves that women’s bodies are still seen as public property, to be violated by soldiers, discussed and debated on by men as if they were the experts on women and their feelings, thoughts, sensations, inclinations. Our minds are seen as weak, unable to reason, to think for ourselves. Instead of believing that women have moral agency, we are seen as morally inferior in every way to men.What men do to women on a daily basis, demeaning, insulting, patronizing, and physically and mentally hurting them, IS terrorism, plain and simple.It reminds me of a news clip I saw several days ago, in which it was declared that Saudi Arabia might enact a new law in which women who are deemed to have “tempting eyes” and “tempting faces” would be forced to cover them up.Why?Because one of the men behind this bill saw a woman with “tempting eyes”, felt attracted to her, and ended up having a fight with her husband. Then he stabbed the man in the hand. The logical conclusion was that the woman who tempted him with her eyes was at fault, so such eyes can and should be hidden away from view. brought this up on Twitter , adding my own comment that perhaps it was the men who should be covered up instead of the women, so that they couldn’t see the tempting eyes, faces, hands, and perhaps the entire existence of women on this planet to avoid being tempted by them.A young man decided to take up this argument with me, accusing me of being against women choosing the hijab and niqab of their own free will. He said he was sure that the majority of women who take up these coverings do it voluntarily. I decided to respond by asking this man if he would consent to covering himself up to avoid arousing the lust of homosexual men. He wouldn’t answer.What justifications have taken place in their mind to make them believe that women are not coerced into wearing the veil? After all, coercion takes many forms: Legal. Physical. Mental. Emotional. Social. Many people use blackmail to convince women to wear hijab or niqab: you won’t be a good Muslim, you’ll go to hell, you’re pleasing God, you’ll be subject to harassment and molestation if you go outside without a veil. By playing on women’s vulnerabilities, by bringing up the imagery of women being sexually violated or bringing shame upon their families by walking around unveiled, by implying a woman’s morality is linked to how she dresses, women are coerced into believing they are making a free choice in the thousands and millions, every day of their lives.The hidden pearls. The precious jewels in velvet boxes. The sweets that attract flies without a wrapper. The metaphors used to convince women that their worth is higher if they remain covered makes clever use of a great deceit: that women are objects to be kept on shelves, their value directly correlated to their shininess, their newness. When are people going to realize that women are not objects or things or possessions? That we are human beings with as much autonomy, independence, sovereignty as men? That we must be left alone, to make our own decisions about what we do with our lives, our bodies, our selves?The truth is that mental, emotional, physical, social or legal coercion over the issue of the veil immediately takes away the ""freedom"" of the ""choice.""Men have no right to exercise control over women in any way, shape, or form. Their opinions have no validity in what concerns women’s bodies and lives. Recruiting, paying, or giving some women a portion of the patriarchal privilege in order that they may influence and coerce other women over the issue of the veil, whether by ""gentle persuasion"" or out-and-out blackmail, is merely another trick men use to exercise control over and dominate women.Here's what freedom of choice really looks like when it comes to the niqab, the hijab, the burqa, and the abaya:Then stand back and let the woman decide for herself. And stay out of it, for good.And for those of you who feel a hijab or a niqab or a burqa or an abaya is not a prison , but a symbol of empowerment, I want to ask you why a piece of cloth on your head or face has so much sway over your lives that it transforms you from a whore into a virtuous woman.Remember that in Pakistan, even the prostitutes wear veils.","Mon, 28 Nov 2011 08:00:00 GMT",http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/application/../wp-content/uploads/2011/11/9105-nudityniqab-1322399928.jpg,"['free', 'woman', 'veil', 'womens', 'nudity', 'tempting', 'women', 'men', 'eyes', 'illusion', 'choice', 'hijab', 'wear', 'niqab']",
