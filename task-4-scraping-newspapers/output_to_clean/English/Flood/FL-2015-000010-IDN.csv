The Jakarta Police and the Jakarta Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD) have reported six casualties from the recent flooding in Jakarta and Bekasi, West Java.



In North Jakarta, 26-year-old Juminah, 92-year-old Suwito and 41-year-old Tukiyem were electrocuted at their house on Jl. Bisma Timur. The same fate befell 53-year-old Ratini bin Kamadi at her house in West Jakarta. Meanwhile, 38-year-old Mukhtar drowned in the Sentiong River in Central Jakarta, while Rizky Fahriansyah drowned in the Cipinang River in East Jakarta.



In Bekasi, West Java, 31-year-old Haryani was electrocuted at her house.



Although few parts of the capital city experienced heavy rain on Thursday, the number of evacuees rose from less than 7,000 on Wednesday to 8,634.



According to Jakarta BPBD data, evacuees were housed in 86 shelters across Jakarta. North Jakarta accounted for the area with the most evacuees with 5,573 people, followed by West Jakarta with 2,761 people.



Although most shelters were set up in public facilities, such as mosques, schools or subdistrict offices, many residents opted to take temporary shelter in Transjakarta bus shelters, including in the Jembatan Tiga bus shelter in North Jakarta and Jembatan Baru in West Jakarta. Meanwhile, others preferred to set up camp next to railway tracks in the two municipalities.



Jakarta BPBD head of operations Basuki Rakhmat said that his agency had been distributing goods to the evacuees.



'We are doing our best to give support to the evacuees. We're ready to provide whatever they need, including blankets, meals or diapers. We also have been receiving generous help from various organizations, such as the World Bank and the UN,' Basuki told The Jakarta Post in his office in Central Jakarta on Thursday.



He went on that the agency was updating residents every six hours about potential rainfall as well as the water levels in reservoirs and sluice gates to anticipate floods.



Meanwhile, after an almost week-long dispute with state-electricity operator PLN, Jakarta Governor Basuki 'Ahok' Tjahaja Purnama met with PLN Jakarta and Tangerang Distribution Area general manager Haryanto to clear the air.



Ahok had blamed PLN for the flooding in Central Jakarta earlier this week after the firm cut the power in Pluit in North Jakarta to avoid accidental electrocution in case of flooding. The Pluit Reservoir therefore had to rely on a power generator, which could only power two of nine water pumps.



'PLN and the Jakarta administration have agreed to build a separate power house for [all] water pumps, so that electricity to reservoirs and the sluice gates won't be cut,' Ahok told reporters after the meeting at City Hall on Thursday.



Currently, he said, electricity for water pumps was distributed from the same power house that provided domestic electricity. 'Therefore, as of 2016, our water pumps will no longer be disturbed by blackouts [in residential areas],' Ahok said, adding that the location and value of the power houses was still in discussion.



Earlier in the day, Ahok went on an impromptu visit to the Sunter River embankment construction site in North Jakarta, a project under the authority of the Public Works Ministry. Ahok said the development of the embankment, which has been in construction since 2013, had previously been hampered by trivial administrative issues. He revealed he had asked for the immediate completion of the embankment.



The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) has warned that residents in the Greater Jakarta area should anticipate heavy rainfall this weekend into the beginning of next week. The BMKG forecasts heavy rain with an intensity of 50 to 100 millimeters, accompanied by rising sea levels on Jakarta's north coast.","Fri, 13 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.thejakartapost.com/files/images2/p8sampah.jpg,"['power', 'flooding', 'west', 'water', 'ahok', 'horizon', 'house', 'lives', 'north', 'evacuees', 'agency', 'rain', 'jakarta', 'shelters', 'claims', 'heavy']",

The Jakarta administration and the central government will soon begin construction on reservoirs in Ciawi and Sukamahi in Bogor, West Java.



The Ciawi and Sukamahi reservoirs would act as water-catchment areas in the highlands south of the capital city, helping to reduce the impact of floods in Jakarta.



The Public Works Ministry's Ciliwung-Cisadane Flood Control Office (BBWSCC) head T. Iskandar said that the Jakarta administration as well as the Bogor regency administration would team up to fund land acquisition.



'Previously, it had been planned that only Jakarta would fund the land acquisition. However, we think it would be easier if Jakarta and Bogor teamed up and split the cost in half,' Iskandar said over the phone on Friday.



A total of Rp 1.2 trillion (US$93.8 million) would be needed to acquire 107 hectares of land in Cipayung Datar and 24.8 hectares in Sukamahi. Thus, Jakarta and Bogor would need to allocate Rp 600 billion each.



Meanwhile, the ministry would be responsible for the physical construction of the reservoirs, which would need up to Rp 1.9 trillion. Iskandar said that the tender for the project contractor would begin this October and construction would start soon after.



The reservoirs would be able to hold up to 11.8 million cubic meters of water and may reduce water flowing to Jakarta by 40 percent when it rains.



'Currently the DED [detail engineering design] is still being drafted. However, land acquisition may be done in the meantime,' he said, adding that currently the ministry was constructing a road for heavy equipment to access the construction sites of both reservoirs.



Iskandar said construction was expected to be completed in 2017.



Governor Basuki 'Ahok' Tjahaja Purnama said that the two reservoirs would greatly help Jakarta and its surrounding areas during the rainy season.



'It would help reduce the overflow of water in the Ciliwung River, which most often comes from West Java,' Ahok told reporters at City Hall in Central Jakarta recently.



Floods in the East Jakarta area are often caused by heavy rain in Bogor which increases water levels, causing the Ciliwung River to overflow.



However, Ahok said that land acquisition would most likely hamper the development of the two reservoirs as the project would need more than 100 hectares.



'Pak Aher [West Java Governor Ahmad Heryawan] is currently strategizing on the best method for land acquisition. The President [Joko Widodo] has asked us to finish the land acquisition by the end of this year,' he said.



The developments in Ciawi and Sukamahi are among many efforts to reduce flooding in Jakarta. Aside from the two reservoirs, Jakarta is also currently developing a number of reservoirs in the city itself, namely in Marunda in North Jakarta, as well as the 'normalization' of areas surrounding the city's many rivers.



Such projects have been hampered by difficulties in land acquisition, as many residents who live in affected areas refuse to give up their land or fail to reach an agreement on the price of the land with the city administration.","Sat, 14 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.thejakartapost.com/favicon.ico,"['start', 'bogor', 'land', 'city', 'reduce', 'construction', 'water', 'acquisition', 'jakarta', 'reservoirs', 'sukamahi']",

More than half the world’s population is urban-based and people living in the flood plains of Asia’s urban areas may rise to 175 million by 2060. Mercy Corps is leading the regional expansion of the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network, a Rockefeller Foundation initiative committed to helping urban areas prepare for, withstand and recover from the projected impacts of climate change.

Asia is experiencing unprecedented urbanization — more than 750 million people live in urban areas, exceeding the combined population of the U.S. and EU. More than 50 percent of Asia’s population is expected to be urban by 2026.

The growth of secondary and tertiary cities causes rapid change in land use, cost and social structures. Climate change further complicates this transformation, making many of these fast-growing cities more vulnerable to both sudden shocks such as coastal storms, and to slow onset stresses like rising sea level or shifting disease patterns.

At the same time, there is momentum for shifting development toward a mindset of building resilience, and innovating to anticipate these challenges and their force multiplier: climate change. A key question is how to do this and ensure resilience-building measures are inclusive. How do we ensure that people who are economically poor, socially and politically marginalized or otherwise vulnerable, often living on the tracts of land most exposed to flooding or landslides, are taken into account in the planning and budgeting by city governments? To be resilient, these perspectives are fundamentally important.

Mercy Corps has been at the forefront working in the urban, poverty and climate nexus. Starting in Indonesia during its political turmoil in the late 1990s, programs were focused on health, nutrition and access to essential services. This background of experience resulted in Mercy Corps Indonesia serving as the lead partner to help secondary cities undertake climate change resilience building as part of the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network, a project supported by the Rockefeller Foundation.

ACCCRN is a multiyear initiative to strengthen the capacity of more than 50 rapidly urbanizing cities in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam to survive, adapt and transform in the face of climate-related stress and shocks. ACCCRN has been dedicated to providing opportunities for exchange and shared learning across cities, demonstrating the value of peer learning, particularly in such a new field. While many networks provide a forum for urban issues and connecting local governments, cities and academic programs, practitioners focused on building urban climate change resilience have unique approaches and perspectives, and we’ve seen how deeply they benefit from their own network.

This is about to grow: With Rockefeller Foundation support, Mercy Corps is developing a new membership platform for urban climate change resilience practitioners that will launch this week in Bangkok at ICLEI’s first Asia-Pacific Forum on Urban Resilience and Adaptation.

The new ACCCRN platform will support practitioners to create and share knowledge, access resources and influence agendas to build inclusive urban climate change resilience.

A key aspect of the network’s mission focuses on inclusivity. Among practitioners in Asia there is widespread understanding that in building urban resilience, technical challenges are relatively easy; it is issues of governance that are hard to change. Indeed, urban resilience projects designed on principles of inclusivity can bring significant and tangible benefits to all people in cities.

In one of the initial ACCCRN member cities, rapidly growing Surat in Western India, this was made abundantly clear through the establishment of an end-to-end early warning system for flooding that enabled coordination across national, state, municipal and community boundaries. This coordinated system meant that in 2013 the city avoided a major flood. In 2006, the hydro-meteorological conditions equaled those of 2013, but without such a system, 75 percent of the city had been flooded for at least a week, including the homes of tens of thousands of poor households living along the riverbanks. These floods are estimated to have cost the city $4.5 billion in damages.

Although projects have yielded tangible benefits in terms of improved resilience outcomes, equally important, they provide a means to facilitate important changes in processes: deeper knowledge of systems behind cities that must be better understood if sustainable change for the better is to be achieved, establishment of new stakeholder networks, new information accessible to government and citizens, new strategies for managing urban systems and services, better links between civil society and government, and decision-making that considers the long-term impacts of climate change.

Projects cannot necessarily translate from one context to another. The successful expansion of urban climate change resilience building will depend on the ability to share the evolving understanding and experiences emerging from this relatively young field. Through ACCCRN, exchange visits enable peers grappling with similar challenges in different contexts to learn from one another and deepen discourse. This was certainly the case in one such exchange facilitated by the Institute for Social and Environmental Transition and the Thailand Environment Institute, which convened city practitioners from two Vietnamese cities (Danang and Can Tho) and three Thai cities (Hat Yai, Ayutthaya and Thung Song), all of which face the challenge of managing major floods.

There is growing demand for these types of peer-learning opportunities, as is clear from the launch of the Urban Climate Resilience-Community of Practice, housed under the Vietnam Urban Forum, which will be part of the new ACCCRN network.

Any initiative aimed at building resilience must include learning and networking among stakeholders, which is why the launch of the ACCCRN platform offers a critical next phase in the journey to equip hundreds of individuals, institutions and cities to face an increasingly uncertain future.

The rain of East Java is heavy, lending a sparkle to the green paddies and the scent of moist earth to the air. As the evening prayer ended, hundreds of boys rushed out of the building in waves, mats slung over their shoulders, sarongs hitched up to their knees, flip-flops squelching in the wet.

These students attend Pondok Modern Darussalam Gontor, one of Indonesia’s many Islamic boarding schools, or pesantren. (Estimates range from about 13,000 to 30,000.) Almost three-quarters of the schools, including Gontor, teach secular subjects like science and history in addition to classical Islamic texts and vocational courses in agriculture and mechanics.

Pesantren have existed for centuries in Indonesia, which is home to the world’s largest Muslim population. But their reputation has taken a battering in recent decades, thanks to a wave of terrorist attacks, including bombings in Bali in 2002 that killed over 200 people. By December 2014, militias in Syria and Iraq, including the radical Sunni Islamist group that calls itself the Islamic State, had attracted some 100 recruits from Indonesia, according to the country’s counterterrorism force.

Some pesantren are indeed linked to terrorist groups. The most notorious is the Al Mukmin school in Ngruki, a short drive from Gontor, some of whose graduates have been associated with the Jemaah Islamiyah, the organization responsible for the Bali bombings. Yet Sidney Jones, director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (I.P.A.C.) and a leading authority on terrorist movements in Southeast Asia, estimates that only around 40 pesantren have terrorist connections.

In the 1950s, two alien machines were introduced to the forests of Borneo, changing the island forever: the chainsaw and the caterpillar tractor. Since then, illegal logging has become all too familiar for those in Borneo, causing devastating damage to one of the most biologically diverse habitats on Earth.

According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), between 1985 and 2001, illegal logging decimated 56 percent of lowland tropical rainforest in the Indonesian territory of Kalimantan. That equates to more than 18,000 square miles of rainforest.

As in many tropical places, deforestation threatens Borneo due to logging, land-clearing and conversion activities. Palm oil plantations are one of the biggest threats to these rainforests. Borneo and Malaysia produce about 90 percent of the world’s palm oil supply. Palm oil is the cheapest vegetable oil, and consumption of the oil is expected to increase rapidly in upcoming years, WWF reports. In fact, the Indonesian government has responded to increasing food demands by proposing to double the 2009 production of more than 22 million tons of palm oil by 2020.

The looting of Borneo didn’t start with palm oil, and it doesn’t end there either. Humans have had a long and complicated history with the island. Chinese traders traveled to Borneo for rhinocerous horn as well as timber, National Geographic reports. Muslim and Portuguese traders were interested in the island’s pepper and gold. In the 19th and 20th centuries, loggers began to flood Borneo. Europe, the United States and Australia have been drilling for oil and natural gases in Borneo for decades. Coal minining is also currently a threat, as it pollutes local rivers.

Protection ordinances in the area often don’t work because they are inadequate or violated without legal consequence. But the environmental consequences are dire. According to WWF, deforestation accounts for up to 20 percent of global manmade carbon dioxide emissions. Borneo, which is only slightly larger than Texas, currently places third in greenhouse gas emissions, right behind China and the U.S., according to National Geographic. At the current rate of Borneo’s deforestation, the island risks major flooding and forest fires, human health impacts, changes in agricultural yields and damage to infrastructure due to climate change.

Advertisement Borneo is home to many endangered species. Large animals such as elephants and orangutans are directly affected as the large areas of forest they require for survival diminish. In addition, road construction through protected areas provides easy access to some of the more remote regions of remaining rainforest, making poaching easier.

9,9,FL-2015-000010-IDN,A day some Indonesians love to hate - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2015/2/15/a-day-some-indonesians-love-to-hate,"Conservatives denounce Valentine’s Day for promoting ‘free sex’, but others say it’s just a fact of life.

Jember, Indonesia – “You know if I was president I’d have Valentine’s Day abolished,” Mufti Ali says.

Sitting at a conference table in the local government building where Mufti serves as a commissioner in Jember, East Java, the legislator says the giving of chocolate or flowers may lead to “free sex” between young people. His wife, Siti, sits next to him nodding in agreement.

This is not the first controversial statement to emanate from the Jember council chambre in the last fortnight.

Last week Mufti Ali made international headlines when he proposed the introduction of virginity “testing” as a prerequisite for 16-year-old girls to graduate from senior high school.

Following outrage from civil rights groups the council has sought to distance itself from the proposal, but Mufti remains clear the government ought to have a role in regulating the sex lives of young people – be it through virginity tests, or the banning of Valentine’s Day.

“Young people are influenced by what they see on TV, stuff from the West. They see people indulging in free sex and they want to do it too. Something must be done about this,” Mufti said.

Mufti is not alone in his views. Last week the Council of Ulema (MUI), Indonesia’s largest Islamic organisation, spoke out against the dangers of Valentine’s Day.

MUI representatives reportedly voiced warnings against chocolates that it claimed were packaged with condoms and other products that could encourage pre-marital sex.

In recent years low-level protests against Valentine’s Day have become commonplace. Last year schoolgirls demonstrated in Malang, East Java, declaring February 14 “headscarf” day and distributed flyers explaining how to dress modestly.

Authorities reportedly arrested more than 100 unmarried Indonesian couples on Saturday during hotel room raids in the cities of Surabaya and Malang, in East Java, and in Pontianak on the island of Borneo.

Islam vs tradition

This is the thing about conservative Muslims in general - is that there's this cognitive dissonance, a denial of reality. Julia Suryakusuma, columnist

“It’s just the normal annual moral panic that is just as routine as the floods in Jakarta,” said Julia Suryakusuma, a socio-political columnist for the Jakarta Post.

“This Islamic conservatism is more of a moral posturing. It happens time and time again, but it doesn’t change the reality as the research has found.”

For all the taboos surrounding premarital sex it appears Indonesian teenagers are still having it.

According to a survey conducted by the National Family Planning Agency in 2010, 51 percent of Jakarta’s teenagers had engaged in premarital sex, with 54 percent in Surabaya, East Java, and 52 percent in Medan, on the island of Sumatra.

“This is the thing about conservative Muslims in general – is that there’s this cognitive dissonance, a denial of reality. Indonesians have always been a raunchy lot,” Suryakusuma said.

Pointing to the animist beliefs that have blended with the import of Islam, Suryakusuma says Indonesians have never been traditionally sexually conservative.

She cites the pilgrimages to Mt Kemukus in East Java, also known as “Sex Mountain”, as an example. Every year thousands of pilgrims – including professed Muslims – flock to Mt Kemukus to have sex with strangers beside the grave of the legendary prince Pangeran Samodro.

The ritual is believed to bring good luck.

“The traditional ancient values and customs have been very open when it comes to sexuality. So this conservatism is very incongruent,” Suryakusuma said.

But if some of Indonesia’s ancient traditions are sexually open, it is unclear whether modernity has brought greater or lesser sexual freedom.

While Saudi Arabia has precipitated the spread of conservative Islam across Southeast Asia by bankrolling networks of mosques and schools, media depictions of liberated Western lifestyles have concurrently influenced the urban upper middle class.

Voices of youth

To Indonesia’s young progressives, the conservative views of councillor Mufti are as confronting as they are to Westerners.

“Trying to tell people how to live their love life is ridiculous,” said Sitta Qarnayni, 31, sitting outside a coffee shop in Kemang, a fashionable sub-district of south Jakarta.

“I don’t really celebrate Valentine’s Day either – not because I’m a Muslim, I just think it’s a bit commercial. But it’s scary when people try and tell you that you can’t celebrate it – everyone should be able to celebrate whatever … they want. Telling someone you love them is a positive thing.”

Sitta, a young professional working in marketing, lives a life far removed from that of women in Indonesia’s provincial towns. She does not drink alcohol, but she likes to party with an international circle of friends whose lifestyle choices she would rather not judge.

“If you want to have sex before marriage that’s totally fine by me,” she said.

“But I also think young people need to be responsible – people need to be educated and aware of the consequences. Here, the culture dictates that if you get pregnant, then you must get married. So you need to think about that.”

But in the coffee shop hangouts frequented by Jember’s young people, the prevailing sentiment remains staunchly conservative.

Most see no harm in the giving of chocolate or flowers to mark Valentine’s Day, but no one was prepared to admit to ever having done so.

Sex before marriage was censured by all male and female interviewees, and most considered kissing to be inappropriate for couples.

But, in regions where the rock has built-in weaknesses, such as Iceland’s heavily jointed basalt, canyon formation can happen in sudden bursts: Powerful floods can swiftly create canyons by plucking out giant blocks and casting them downstream. How important those types of episodic, catastrophic events are in shaping the landscape has been poorly understood, as such an erosive signature can be difficult to trace through millennia. However, by combining an analysis of the landscape with helium isotope dating, which measures when the newly eroded rocks were exposed to cosmic rays in Earth’s atmosphere, scientists have now traced the step-wise history of the formation of Iceland’s Jökulsárgljúfur canyon, they report online today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The canyon, they found, was formed during three extreme flood events on the Jökulsá á Fjöllum River (which flows into the Dettifoss waterfall, pictured, reputed to be the most powerful in Europe). These flood events were fed by meltwater from the Vatnajökull glacier, which sits atop several volcanoes, including Bárðarbunga. The floods occurred roughly 9000 years, 5000 years, and 2000 years ago; they lasted only days, but each dramatically deepened and widened the canyon by cutting away more than 2 kilometers of bedrock.","Mon, 09 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/sn_icelandH.jpg?itok=eqMI-XgW,"['floods', 'powerful', 'dramatic', 'canyon', 'flood', 'shaped', 'formation', 'landscape', 'formed', 'icelands', 'icelandic', 'canyons', 'events']",

A winter of strange weather and turbulent transatlantic flights has scientists asking: Has a predicted climate imbalance of the jet stream begun?



The Arctic is warming faster than other parts of the world, and scientists believe that is having a dramatic impact on the jet stream, which may be responsible for the unusual weather and stronger upper atmospheric winds of late.



On Jan. 8, thousands of Britons were left without electricity in the aftermath of the most violent storms to hit the isles in more than a century. British Airways flight 114 carried by strong winds journeyed from New York to London in a record five hours and 16 minutes.



Several jetliners flying from Europe to North America in recent weeks faced powerful headwinds, which forced them to make unscheduled mid-flight stops to refuel.



The jet stream ' a narrow, variable band of westerly air currents miles above the Earth ' is strongest in winter, when boundaries between hot tropical and cold polar air masses are most pronounced.



Currents can be even more turbulent at high altitudes flown in by jetliners some 10 kilometers above the Earth, where winds can reach 300 kilometers per hour.



Since 2012, researcher Jennifer Francis of Rutgers University in New Jersey has been trying to develop new scientific tools to study these 'very messy' changes in the jet stream.



She revealed her preliminary findings to the Royal Society of Britain last fall.



'Last winter and this winter the jet stream has been unusually strong,' she said, adding that scientists expect more of the same in coming years.



'The Arctic melting,' she explained, 'is happening very rapidly and it must be having an impact on the jet stream.'



But not every expert feels the same way.



Climate expert James Screen of the University of Exeter, who recently co-authored an as yet unpublished paper on the impact of Arctic warming on the jet stream, is skeptical of any direct link between the dramatic retreat of Arctic sea ice and more turbulent air travel.



'I have not seen any evidence to suggest a trend in the speed of the jet stream over the past few decades,' he said in an email.



He added, however: 'That is not to say that climate change may not impact the jet stream in the future.'



The jet stream changes from year to year due to natural climate variability, Screen explained, so it is difficult to detect 'robust trends.'



Reading University climatologist Paul Williams told AFP that 'equator-to-pole temperature difference is decreasing in the bottom few kilometers of the atmosphere because of rapid Arctic warming.'



Research shows 'evidence that the lower part of the jet stream is weakening as a consequence,' Williams said. But planes cruise at higher altitudes, where wind shears are believed to be strengthening.



More study is needed, he said, but the impacts on aviation in the coming decades 'could be more clear-air turbulence, resulting in a bumpier ride for passengers.'","Mon, 16 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.thejakartapost.com/files/images2/p19bumi1.jpg,"['stream', 'impact', 'winter', 'turbulent', 'kilometers', 'arctic', 'unravel', 'scientists', 'university', 'warmings', 'jet', 'try', 'winds']",

Researchers are planning to use drones equipped with vegetation-penetrating lasers to scan the Amazon rainforest for signs of past civilizations, reports the University of Exeter.

A team led by Exeter archaeologist José Iriarte hopes the initiative will help settle the debate over the extent to which Earth’s largest rainforest was occupied and shaped by humans.

“The data gathered through the project has the potential to estimate, for the first time, the spatial scale of past human disturbance across the entire Amazon basin,” said Iriarte in a statement. “Our project will resolve the previously overlooked role of humans as important agents of environmental change; from being viewed as the ‘noble savage’ living in harmony with ancient forests creating little or no impact on the landscape to actively shaping Amazonia through agricultural practices. In order to make informed decisions about a sustainable future, it is critical that policy-makers have a sound understanding of the historical role of humans in shaping the Amazonian landscapes and to what extent forests were resilient to historical disturbances.”

The project, which is being done in partnership with the National Institute for Amazonian Research (INPA) and the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), among other institutions, will rely on a combination of approaches, including field-based assessment for precision and remote sensing technologies like an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors for scale. LiDAR allows researchers to “see” through vegetation and scan the forest flood for signs of ruins and other archaeological features like so-called “black earth” or “terra preta”, rich soils created by agricultural societies. The technology has also been used to map sub-canopy vegetation and account for carbon stored in forests.

The scale and nature of Pre-Columbian societies in the Amazon has been a hotly debated issue. Some researchers believe that vast areas of the Amazon were inhabited by large human populations that played a role in shaping the region’s ecology and biodiversity. Others scoff at the notion of a heavily populated Amazon, arguing that the rainforest’s scare resources would limit large populations to settlements along rivers, leaving most of the region lightly populated or devoid of humans.

The first drone flight is scheduled for the fall of 2015.","Wed, 18 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.mongabay.com/wp-content/themes/mongabay_v1/img/icons/favicon.png,"['civilizations', 'drones', 'vegetation', 'project', 'shaping', 'scan', 'societies', 'rainforest', 'scale', 'amazon', 'role', 'signs', 'hidden', 'human']",

Schumer spoke Tuesday during a visit to the Finch Paper plant in Glens Falls, N.Y. He joined company officials and called for new tariffs on overseas firms that engage in a practice known as “dumping.”

That means they allegedly sell their paper here in the United States at artificially low prices.

A Wave of Cheap Paper

Beginning in 2011, Debabrata Mukherjee, CEO of Finch Paper, said companies in China and Indonesia, and even Australia, began to flood the United States market with paper at unnaturally low prices. ""We have lost tens of millions of dollars of sales that has resulted from this increase of imports at lower pricing levels,"" he said.

Finch employs more than 600 people. It is one of the largest private firms in New York’s North Country. Mukherjee said the plant is going strong and earning a healthy profit. However, at a time when the U.S. market for paper products is shrinking, he said unfair competition could threaten the long-term health of the plant. ""We need a level playing field,"" he insisted.

During a visit to the mill on Tuesday, New York Senator Charles Schumer toured the state of the art production facility and talked to workers.

Time for tariffs?

Schumer said the answer to protect United States companies is to impose stiff tariff penalties on firms that use unfair advantages to compete. ""Oftentimes, these companies receive huge subsidies from their home governments so they can undercut our American goods,"" Schumer said. ""Lots of them keep doing it.""

Finch filed a complaint with Federal trade authorities and asked for tariffs to be imposed against Chinese firms and companies operating in Australia and Indonesia. Schumer said he has seen this strategy work before to protect other New York state industries.

At yesterday’s press conference, Glens Falls Mayor Jack Diamond pointed out that this is Finch Paper’s 150anniversary and he described the mill as crucial. ""They employ over 600 people in this community and we will win that battle,"" Diamond said.

Senator Schumer said Federal officials reviewing Finch’s trade complaint will likely take six to 18 months to reach a decision. That decision could affect other mills in New York including Georgia Pacific in Plattsburgh and IP in Ticonderoga.

Since 2011, when allegations of foreign paper dumping began to surface, eight mills in the United States closed down and others have scaled back operations.","Wed, 18 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/images/140218finch_3.jpg,"['firms', 'competition', 'united', 'chinese', 'faces', 'dump', 'mills', 'york', 'paper', 'companies', 'schumer', 'states', 'plant', 'finch']",

It is feared the project could have catastrophic consequences for the national capital.

Environmentalists warn that apart from the eastern, northeastern and western parts of Delhi, the south of the city may also be under water in the event of a flood.

River Yamuna at Kata Pathar, the proposed site of the Lakhwar-Vyasi project

Environmentalists have expressed their concerns to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that Delhi may be inundated as the project will be executed on a highly seismically-active zone that is prone to landslides. But the Central Water Commission (CWC) claims that all critical issues, including those of forests and environmental clearances, have been addressed.

“It is assured that any project of such scale is planned only when it is necessary and it goes through rigorous scrutiny right from its appraisal to clearance. Various ministries and departments are consulted… so as to appropriately take care of interest of various stakeholders in the project,” Sanjiv Aggarwal, Chief Engineer, CWC, said in a letter (dated January 29, 2015) to retired IFS officer Manoj Misra of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan.

Mishra was one of the signatories among 50 environmentalists and environmental groups who wrote a letter to the prime minister on September 14, 2014, seeking abandonment of the proposed Lakhwar-Vyasi project.

Other groups, including Save the Rivers Campaign, Citizens Concern for Dams and Development and Khedut Mazdoor Chetna Sangath, and individuals like Medha Patkar of Narmada Bachao Andolan and Vandana Shiva of Navdanya also signed the letter.

The proposed Lakhwar-Vyasi project is the biggest on the Yamuna so far, and entails construction of a massive 204-metre-high dam with storage capacity of 580 million cubic metres.

The project also involves submergence of 1385.2 ha of land, including 868.08 ha of forest land, which is likely to affect 50 villages.

Significantly, the proposed site is situated just about 120 km downstream of the holy shrine of Yamnotri, where the Yamuna River originates.

According to ecologists, the project, conceived first in 1986, with a large reservoir, is to come up in an area (the Yamuna valley) that is seismically active, prone to flash-floods, erosion and landslides, as stated in a research paper of Padma Bhushan-acclaimed seismologist K.S. Valdiya, which has also strongly spoken out against construction of big dams in the region.

Besides “the spillway capacity of the project has been dangerously underestimated resulting in significant risks of dam damage or breakage with concomitant risks of unprecedented downstream flooding and destruction,” the letter by the environmentalists asserted.

While the project spillway capacity is proposed to be 8000 cumecs, the location, as per latest scientific estimates, was likely to experience probable maximum flood of 18,000 cumecs.

Ecology groups had warned that in any such event, cities like the holy Paonta Sahib and the capital city of Delhi would be affected.

The national capital would directly face deluge as it is the first city downstream sitting on the river (unlike Panipat, Sonepat, Karnal and Yamunanagar, which are a few kilometres away).

Warning that “the river would be completely destroyed both in the upstream and downstream of the project” situated near its very origin, the plea sought that the first 120 km of the Yamuna be declared an eco-sensitive zone, similar to the first 120km of Ganga from Gangotri to Uttarkashi since not only the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi basins, but the Yamuna basin, too, inflicted massive floods during the June 2013 disaster in the state.

While stating that the project did not undergo “basic, credible or social appraisal in any participatory manner” and lacked any “legally valid environmental or forest clearance”, the plea claimed that no cumulative impact assessment of various existing, under-construction and planned dams, barrages and hydro-projects in the Yamuna system have been done despite the recommendations of the Ravi Chopra committee appointed by the Environment Ministry in the wake of the June 2013 disaster in Uttarakhand.

The Environment Ministry’s affidavit to the Supreme Court in December last year had endorsed the panel’s report stating that hydro power projects in the Ganga-Bhagirathi and Alaknanda basins had strained the state’s environment in the form of loss of forests, degraded forest quality, geological and social impacts and have enhanced landslides and other disasters.

The ministry had also stated, “it is pertinent to conclude that there has been a direct and an indirect impact of these HEPs (hydro-electric projects) in the aggravation of the floods of 2013”.

Apart from critically disastrous impacts, doubts were also expressed over the actual total power generation capacity of the project, compared to the Tehri dam which is alleged to have “killed the Ganga river system”.

Claiming that the dam was highly susceptible to breakage on account of various reasons, Manoj Misra of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan and a retired IFS officer, said: “The government’s decision to pursue it is contrary to its own ambition of seeking an aviral (continuous), nirmal (pure) flow of Ganga and its tributaries and its own stance before the Supreme Court. They want it for supplying water for Delhi while ignoring the potential of water harvesting and conservation of the city’s vast and extensive natural water bodies.”","Sun, 08 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/09/2579A42D00000578-0-image-a-7_1423442723874.jpg,"['various', 'lakhwarvyasi', 'raises', 'flood', 'experts', 'delhi', 'project', 'dam', 'warn', 'fears', 'yamuna', 'hydroelectric', 'downstream', 'water', 'river', 'proposed']",

As the Bali Nine pair on death row come to terms with their imminent execution, the Indonesian justice system is being accused of hypocrisy after a local ice manufacturer avoided the death penalty.

While Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are facing the death penalty for attempting to smuggle drugs into Australia from Bali, local kingpin Hangky Gunawan has been given only a jail sentence for a similar crime.

Despite hundreds of pleas for clemency for Sukumaran and Chan, Indonesian president Joko Widodo maintains that his hard-line stance against drug dealers will not budge.

But the story of Hangky Gunawan, an Indonesian ice manufacturer who was convicted in 2007 and was handed the death penalty before his appeal - which followed directly after the Bali Nine duos' - won him both a reduced sentence and most importantly, his life, Fairfax reports.

Australian death-row prisoners Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right) are facing the death penalty for attempting to smuggle drugs into Australia from Bali

This is despite Gunwan, who owned the drug-producing business based in Surabaya, East Java, and organised ice's distribution, was caught by police with over 11kg of the drug.

When Chan and Sukumaran lodged their final appeal to the Supreme Court in Jakarta in 2011, numbered case 37 and 38, Gunwan's appeal for life was directly after theirs, numbered 39.

But while the Australians' judicial review were rejected, in Gunwan's it was decided that the death penalty violated both the Indonesian constitution, the country's human rights and quoted the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, according to Fairfax.

His prison sentence was subsequently reduced to 12 years and Gunwan was saved from execution.

The result presents a stark contrast to the trials endured by Chan and Sukumaran who are expected to be moved to Nusa Kambangan - a prison island off central Java - where prisoners on death row are executed.

From there they will be given 72 hours' notice of their execution by firing squad.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has also called out Indonesia's justice system for its hypocrisy after Mr Widodo offered 'optimum protection' for over 200 of his citizens who face death sentences overseas - some of them being drug smugglers.

'I should also just observe today that millions of Australians are feeling very, very upset about what may soon happen to two Australians in Indonesia,' Mr Abbott said.

'My plea even at this late stage is for Indonesia to be as responsive to us as it expects other countries to be to them when they plead for the lives of their citizens on death row overseas.'

Australia has not decided how it would respond to the executions, including whether to withdraw its ambassador, but Mr Abbott told The Daily Telegraph newspaper: 'We will find ways of making our displeasure known.'

Indonesia's Foreign Ministry has confirmed it has invited all embassies with citizens to be executed this month to a meeting on the formalities on Monday.

A date for the executions won't be provided at the meeting, but the provision of 72 hours notice will be discussed, as well as access to the prisoners for family and logistics over foreign media coverage.

Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir says officials representing Ghana, France, the Philippines and Nigeria have also been summoned.

When Indonesia executed five foreign nationals last month, the meeting with relevant embassies took place one day before Attorney-General HM Prasetyo announced the execution date.

That announcement signalled the 72-hour notice period.

But in this case, the prisoners have to be transferred from jails all over Indonesia to the execution location, Nusakambangan island, off Central Java.

Authorities have permission to move Chan and Sukumaran from Bali's Kerobokan jail, but haven't set a date.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Friday suggested the depth of feeling in Australia is so strong that Australians may boycott Indonesia if the executions go ahead, but she denied that she was urging for a boycott.

'I knew that there was very deep concern in the Australian public about the likely executions of Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan, and that Australians will make their own decisions as to whether they want to travel to a country that does have the death penalty,' Ms Bishop told Macquarie Radio on Saturday.

Boycott calls were growing on social media before Ms Bishop's remarks and politicians have received a flood of letters about the executions.

Ms Bishop's opposition counterpart Tanya Plibersek told the Seven Network she didn't think this was helpful.

'I'm really not sure that boycotting Bali is going to make much of a difference to the attitude in Jakarta,' Ms Plibersek said.

Chan and Sukumaran have been disturbed by the evident preparation for their execution as prison guards broke open the lock to their jail cells to conduct a search.

Artist Ben Quilty says Sukumaran is no longer sleeping as he waits with dread for a final knock on his door to take him to his execution by firing squad.

Mr Sukumaran is passionate painter who has been conducting art classes to other inmates while in Kerobokan jail. The classes have been his way of showing he has rehabilitated

Quilty said goodbye the 33-year-old to at Kerobokan prison in Bali for the last time on Thursday.

'He knows someone will knock on his door in the middle of the night. I offered to bring him valium but he said 'no'. He is completely free from drugs and won't even take sleeping pills,' Quilty told ABC radio.

The Australian artist, who in 2011 won the Archibald Prize, has been Sukumaran's mentor since 2012, helping him develop a talent for painting.

Australia's efforts to stop the executions have so far failed, along with desperate legal bids.

Their Sydney families are in Bali, where they have spent the past three weeks paying daily visits to the men in Kerobokan jail.

Credit: Oregon State University

Engineers at Oregon State University have completed one of the most precise evaluations yet done about the impact of a major tsunami event on the Columbia River, what forces are most important in controlling water flow and what areas might be inundated.

They found, in general, that tidal stages are far more important than river flow in determining the impact of a tsunami; that it would have its greatest effect at the highest tides of the year; and that a tsunami would be largely dissipated within about 50 miles of the river's mouth, near Longview, Washington.

Any water level increases caused by a tsunami would be so slight as to be almost immeasurable around the Portland metropolitan area or Bonneville Dam, the study showed. But water could rise as much as 13 feet just inside the mouth of the Columbia River, and almost 7 feet within a few miles of Astoria.

""There have been previous models of Columbia River run-up as a result of a tsunami, but they had less resolution than this work,"" said David Hill, an associate professor of civil engineering in the OSU College of Engineering. ""We carefully considered the complex hydrodynamics, subsidence of grounds that a tsunami might cause, and the impacts during different scenarios.""

The impact of tsunamis on rivers is difficult to predict, researchers say, because many variables are involved that can either dampen or magnify their effect. Such factors can include the width and shape of river mouths, bays, river flow, tidal effects, and other forces.

But the major tsunami in Japan in 2011, which was caused by geologic forces similar to those facing the Pacific Northwest, also included significant inland reach and damage on local rivers. As a result, researchers are paying increased attention to the risks facing residents along such rivers.

The OSU research has been published in the Journal of Waterway, Port, Coastal and Ocean Engineering, by Hill and OSU graduate student Kirk Kalmbacher. It's based on a major earthquake on the Cascadia Subduction Zone and a resulting tsunami, with simulations done at different rivers flows; and high, low, flood and ebb tides.

Of some interest is that the lowest elevation of a tsunami wave generally occurs at a high tide, but its overall flooding impact is the greatest because the tide levels are already so high. Because of complex hydrodynamic interactions, the study also found that only on a flood tide would water actually wash up and over the southern spit of the Columbia River mouth, with some local flooding based on that.

Tides, overall, had much more impact on the reach of a tsunami than did the amount of water flowing in the river.

""We were a little surprised that the river's water flow didn't really matter that much,"" Hill said. ""The maximum reach of a tsunami on the Columbia will be based on the tidal level at the time, and of course the magnitude of the earthquake causing the event.""

Based on a maximum 9.0 magnitude earthquake and associated tsunami, at the highest tide of the year, the research concluded:

Just offshore, the tsunami would raise water levels about 11.5 to 13 feet.

Just inside the mouth of the Columbia River, the water would rise about 13 feet.

At river mile 6, approaching Hammond, Ore., the river would rise about 10 feet.

At river mile 12, within about 3 miles of Astoria, the river would rise about 6.6 feet.

At river mile 25, near Welch Island, the river would rise about 1.6 feet.

At river mile 50, near Longview, Washington, there would be no measurable rise in the river.

Maps have been developed as a result of this research that make more precise estimates of the areas which might face tsunami-induced flooding. They should aid land owners and land use planners, Hill said, in making improved preparations for an event that researchers now say is inevitable in the region's future. Experts believe this region faces subduction zone earthquakes every 300-600 years, and the last one occurred in January, 1700.

There are some noted differences in the projections on these newer maps and older ones, Hill said.

Malaysia has banned pilgrimages to Israel and Palestine over security concerns in the Middle East, including the Gaza conflict and the threat of Islamic State (IS).

Deputy Home Minister Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar said the ministry has frozen all approvals for Christians to travel to the region because of the unrest due to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

When asked if the ban was also because of the threat of terror group IS, the deputy minister said it was because of all aspects of threats in the region.

""We are concerned about all threats to security there,"" he said.

""We decided to freeze travel to Israel and Jerusalem for the sake of the safety of Malaysians who want to go there. This is because of the war and the unpredictable situation there that could jeopardize the safety of travelers.""

IS loyalists in Libya had recently released a video showing the mass beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians, who were kidnapped weeks before.

In early February, the terrorist group also beheaded Japanese journalist Kenji Goto and burnt a Jordanian pilot alive, as seen in videos it released proclaiming the killings.

Last week, Home Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi revealed that intelligence reports showed that the radical Islamist group was plotting to kidnap wealthy Malaysians.

Despite having no diplomatic relations with Israel, Malaysia has allowed Christian pilgrims to visit the country, which is regarded as holy to Christianity, Islam and Judaism.

However, a church in Kuala Lumpur revealed that the applications for some of its members to travel to Israel for pilgrimage and a Christian conference were rejected.

A Home Ministry official had told the church that approvals to enter the Holy Land have been frozen until further notice. The church has since canceled the trip.

Thousands of Christians travel each year to the Holy Land, which also includes Jerusalem and Palestine, to perform pilgrimages. Muslims also travel to Jerusalem to pray at the revered Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third-holiest site and where Prophet Muhammad's first followers prayed toward. It was only later that they turned towards east to Mecca for their prayers.

However, the war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza in July-August 2014, during which more than 2,100 Palestinians and 73 Israelis were killed, had posed security concerns for travelers.

Following that, countries such as the United States — Israel's main ally — as well as the United Kingdom have issued travel warnings for its citizens against visits to Jerusalem and Gaza.

Wan Junaidi said the said the government made the decision to impose the travel ban as it ""knew better"" of the situation in the region.

""The ministry is still studying and monitoring the current situation there and will make further decisions when necessary.""

Prior to 2010, Christians from Muslim-majority Malaysia were free to perform pilgrimages in the Holy Land but the government banned such trips in January 2010 because of the security risks posed by the conflict between Israel and Palestine.

A year later, the ban was lifted but the government tightened the rules regarding Christian pilgrimages to the region, including quotas and other restrictions.

Then, only 20 pilgrims per church group were allowed, there was an 18-year-old minimum age requirement and the government also restricted where Christians could go in Israel as well as limited their stay to a week.

Following an outcry, the government rescinded the quotas, minimum age requirement and all other travel limits on Malaysian Christians who wanted to perform their pilgrimages to Jerusalem in December 2012.

But Christians still had to obtain permission from the ministry prior to their travel.

Council of Churches of Malaysia general-secretary Hermen Shastri said travel groups have been calling on the government to lift the ""temporary suspension"" of pilgrimages to Palestine and Israel.

""Travel groups have been calling on the authorities to lift the suspension as many are being denied a pilgrimage. It is hoped that the PM (Prime Minister Najib Razak) will act on this matter as soon as possible,"" he said.

23,23,FL-2015-000010-IDN,"As Extreme Weather Increases, A Push for Advanced Forecasts - Yale Environment 360",https://e360.yale.edu/features/as_extreme_weather_increases_a_push_for_advanced_forecasts,"Like a pipeline in the sky, the plume of sodden tropical air advanced mile-high above the Pacific Ocean, heading toward the California coast. This “atmospheric river” — a long, narrow band of concentrated water vapor — carried the moisture equivalent of about 15 Mississippi Rivers. When it made landfall, it dumped a massive amount of rain on the densely populated stretch of California from San Francisco to Los Angeles, unleashing floodwaters, causing landslides, and cutting off power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses.

Atmospheric rivers fuel some of western North America’s most intense and destructive winter storms, and this one, slamming California last December, was a big one. But despite nearly a foot of rain in some places, damage was considerably less than it could have been, thanks to forecasts that pinpointed the storm’s course a week before it struck, giving communities time to prepare.

“I think that [forecast] was a home run,” said Mike Dettinger — a research hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California — who studies atmospheric rivers. “That is how we feel the forecasts ought to work for us now.”

Early warnings for extreme weather like atmospheric rivers will be increasingly crucial in coming years as global warming keeps temperatures on the rise. A hotter planet will pump more energy into the atmosphere, setting off more extreme heat waves, lengthy droughts, intense storms, and other “high impact” events that can cause major property damage, economic havoc, widespread injury, and death. More frequent weather extremes could also trigger disease outbreaks, jeopardize food security and water availability, and even lead to political instability and civil unrest.

Advanced forecasting can help avert disasters, say scientists, who are harnessing unprecedented computing power, enhancing mathematical models, and devising new observation methods to provide better and longer-term forecasts for the stormier times ahead.

Tiny errors at the beginning of a forecast can lead to wide misses by the end.

“Improving our forecast capabilities is incredibly important,” said Paul Higgins, a climate scientist and policy director of the American Meteorological Society. “There’s the potential to improve monitoring and be able to identify when problems could occur. It helps protect life and property [and] allows us to reduce the risks that we face from high-impact weather.”

Most forecasts today can see clearly only a few days ahead. It all hinges on the performance of computer models that assimilate observations from sources like satellites, radar, and weather stations into numerical simulations that are run forward to predict future conditions. Lengthen the lens and the focus gets blurred by model discrepancies and uncertainty, observation error, and the complex physics of weather. A model may be able to project a likely torrential downpour 10 days off, for instance, but lacks resolution fine enough to tell more precisely where the storm will strike until it’s two or three days away, leaving communities scrambling to prepare.

Even then, tiny errors at the beginning of a forecast can lead to wide misses by the end — one of the reasons the monster blizzard prediction that launched a pre-emptive shutdown of New York City last month was so far off the mark. That forecast was further skewed by disagreement between the two most widely used weather models: one developed by the U.S. Weather Service and the other by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Needing to make a quick decision as the storm bore down, forecasters went with the European model, based on its better track record for predicting Hurricane Sandy and other recent events. This time, however, the U.S. model was more accurate.

To allow more time for complex decisions and preparations in the face of rising weather threats, scientists are now looking to medium-range forecasting — predicting high-impact events one to two weeks in advance — and are devising new tools and technologies to sharpen their weather vision. These include beefed-up supercomputers crunching complex algorithms; seven- to 14-day heat wave and gale predictions; high-resolution models with a more dense data grid on location, altitude, and time; and better accounting for uncertainty.

‘In a changing climate, it’s important to be able to anticipate how much water might be available in the future.’

Medium-range forecasting efforts are gearing up across the globe. The World Meteorological Organization has just launched its High Impact Weather Project, a 10-year, multinational mission. One goal is to create accurate predictions, up to two weeks in advance, for weather that can cause urban floods, severe winter storms, fires, and extreme winds.

“As a consequence of changing climate we foresee an urgent need to extend the forecast concept to cover a much wider range of environmental factors ”¦ over a longer range of timescales,” said Paolo Ruti, chief of the organization’s World Weather Research Division.

In the United Kingdom, the Met Office will power up a new supercomputer in September, enabling detailed predictions of disruptive events like flooding, strong winds, and heavy snowfalls. The Danish Meteorological Institute, along with a group of universities and public agencies, is working on medium-range and longer precipitation forecasts for Denmark, Greenland, and the Arctic. The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, an independent consortium of 34 European states, continues to hone its powerful Integrated Forecasting System. Other advanced forecasting endeavors include the Japan Meteorological Agency’s Global Spectral Model and Canada’s Global Environmental Multi-scale model.

In the U.S., the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is undergoing a major supercomputer upgrade. The increased computing power allowed the weather service to overhaul its outdated Global Forecasting System, which performed well on its maiden runs forecasting the path of the January blizzard that brushed past New York City.

Many forecasts predicted the blizzard along the U.S. East Coast in late January would bury New York City, but the storm largely missed the city and slammed into New England instead. NASA/GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER

One U.S. project — a collaboration between NOAA, NASA, Scripps, and other agencies to improve forecasts of atmospheric rivers — is underway in California. Atmospheric rivers, which average 250 miles wide and up to 6,000 miles long, are notorious coastal flood-makers in the Americas and Europe, and new studies implicate them in events ranging from rapid ice-melt in Greenland to mammoth snowfalls in Antarctica. Atmospheric rivers are especially important for California, causing more than 80 percent of the state’s serious floods, but also providing up to half of its annual precipitation.

”They fill our reservoirs, they bring these cycles of wet and dry years, they end our droughts, they sustain our wetlands and fisheries, they breach our levees. These things are important,” said Dettinger. And their impact is growing. Dettinger’s analysis of climate models predicts that if greenhouse gas emissions continue their current climb, the number of days atmospheric rivers hit the West Coast each year would rise from today’s average of 25 to more than 65 by the end of the century. Higher temperatures generate more evaporation, he said, and with more water in the atmosphere the storms will become heavier, more intense, and more likely to “stall” and produce floods.

Jason Cordeira, a meteorology professor at Plymouth State University in New Hampshire and lead forecaster on the CalWater 2015 project, combined statistics from an ensemble of 21 weather models to create an atmospheric river Landfall Tool. A pre-test serendipitously coincided with the December atmospheric river — with worthy results.

Maps are being developed that show areas likely to suffer extreme heat and humidity seven to 14 days in the future.

“For a number of different reasons, the dry run was very, very successful,” said Cordeira, who worked with colleagues from NOAA and Scripps. “We saw the potential for an atmospheric river out nine, 10 days in advance.” The resolution was so clear that forecasters could see where the storm would blow ashore a full week before it landed.

Knowing when and where an atmospheric river will hit, how much moisture it contains, and how fast it will move over land is vital for flood control, transportation, emergency planning, and water supply.

“In a changing climate, it’s really important for societies to be able to anticipate how much water might be available in the future, especially in a state like California,” said Marty Ralph, a research meteorologist at Scripps and co-director of the CalWater project. “We really need to make sure the climate models are handling atmospheric rivers properly.”

Advanced forecasts for other anticipated global warming impacts, such as severe heat waves, are also in the works. For instance, the U.S. National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center is developing a “Week-2” outlook with maps showing areas likely to suffer extreme heat and humidity seven to 14 days in the future. The heat outlook is set for release in 2016, and heavy rain and high wind forecasts will be added after that, said Jon Gottschalck, acting chief of the center’s operational predictions branch.

NOAA’s recently launched High-Impact Weather Prediction Project intends to boost its model resolution for a longer view. Resolution, said project manager Tim Schneider, a research meteorologist, depends on “how fine you chunk up the earth.” Smaller chunks enable finer resolution — yielding a more fine-grained picture, but also requiring a lot more computing power. “It actually means you need to change the way you do modeling,” said Schneider. “It turns out to be a very big challenge.”

The upshot, say Schneider and others working on extreme weather forecasting, will be to give officials like resource managers and emergency planners the time and information they’ll need for complex decisions, such as whether to let water out of reservoirs when severe rains threaten or shut down city transit systems in advance of snow.

Twenty-first century demographics — with the global population headed toward 10 billion by 2100 and ever-larger numbers of people living along coastlines — make improved extreme weather forecasting imperative, climate scientists say.



“When you combine the impact of these changing demographics with the possibility of a stormier world,” said NOAA’s Schneider, “the effect is pretty staggering, quite honestly.”

WASHINGTON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - The world's oceans are clogged with plastic debris, but how much of it finds its way into the seas annually? Enough to place the equivalent of five grocery bags full of plastic trash on every foot (30 cm) of every nation's coastline around the globe.

That's according to scientists who released research on Thursday estimating that a staggering 8 million metric tones of plastic pollution enter the oceans each year from the world's 192 coastal countries based on 2010 data.

Based on rising waste levels, they estimated that more than 9 million tons would end up in the oceans in 2015.

Experts have sounded the alarm in recent years over how plastic pollution is killing huge numbers of seabirds, marine mammals, sea turtles and other creatures while sullying ocean ecosystems.

China was responsible for the most ocean plastic pollution per year with an estimated 2.4 million tons, about 30 percent of the global total, followed by Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Egypt, Malaysia, Nigeria and Bangladesh.

The United States was the only rich industrialized nation in the top 20, and it ranked No. 20. Coastal EU nations combined would rank 18th.

The trash encompasses just about anything imaginable made of plastic including shopping bags, bottles, toys, food wrappers, fishing gear, cigarette filters, sunglasses, buckets and toilet seats.

""In short, you name it and it is probably somewhere in the marine environment,"" said Kara Lavender Law, a research professor of oceanography with the Massachusetts-based Sea Education Association.

The estimates were based on information including World Bank data for trash generated per person in all nations with a coastline, coastal population density, the amount of plastic waste countries produce and the quality of their waste-management practices.

""I think this is a wake-up call for how much waste we produce,"" said University of Georgia environmental engineering professor Jenna Jambeck.

The researchers calculated that 275 million tons of plastic waste was generated in the 192 coastal countries that year, with an estimated 8 million tons entering the ocean and a possible range between 4.8 million and 12.7 million tons.

""The most pressing need is to capture plastic waste to prevent it from entering the environment,"" Law said. ""This means investing in waste management infrastructure, especially in those countries with rapidly developing economies.""

""In high-income countries, we also have a responsibility to reduce the amount of waste, especially plastic waste, that we produce,"" she added.

The research was published in the journal Science.

Grade 9 student Datumama Santi Tutin is preparing for the trip of a lifetime. She’s one of 24 young Muslim and indigenous people from the Philippines’ troubled Mindanao region who will soon be traveling to the United States for a youth leadership conference.

But for Tutin, the trip will be especially meaningful in the wake of January’s tragedy in nearby Mamasapano district, which saw the deaths of 67 people in a bloody clash between police commandos and Moro rebel fighters.

The massacre has ignited a political firestorm in the Philippines and threatened to derail the tenuous peace process between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).

Some politicians called for the government to delay passage of the Bangsamoro Basic Law, which was slated to be a major step in ending almost four decades of Moro rebellion. The Philippine Congress suspended discussion of the proposed legislation after the killings in Mamasapano.

For Tutin, such feelings are oblivious to the plight of civilians who have spent their lives amid conflict.

“Some people are calling for an all-out war [against Moro rebels] as if they know how it is to live in a time of war,” Tutin told ucanews.com in an interview.

Tutin was only seven years old when she was first forced to flee her home. She said her family left because of armed clashes between the MILF and government forces.

“They do not know what war is and how ugly war can be for us,” she said.

The Philippines military has reported that some 6,000 people have again fled their homes because of renewed fighting between rebel MILF fighters and their counterparts in the breakaway group, Bangsamoro Freedom Fighters (BIFF), in the province of Maguindanao. BIFF has rejected the MILF’s planned peace deal with the government.

Military spokesman Lt Col Harold Cabunoc told ucanews.com that residents have evacuated for fear that they would be caught in the crossfire.

""They also fear that the conflict will spread,"" said Cabunoc.

Rius Valle, head of the Children Rehabilitation Center, a non-governmental organization, said many kids have refused to go back to school in Mamasapano town, where the January fighting erupted.

“Children think that the war will happen again,” he said.

During a Senate inquiry in Manila last week, an irate senator, Alan Peter Cayetano, said the government must not pursue peace with the MILF. Instead, Cayetano said the Moro rebels should be punished for their roles in the clash that killed at least 44 police commandos.

MILF leaders, however, say the bloodshed could have been avoided if there had been better coordination between the rebels and the police, who were reportedly targeting a wanted terrorist when the operation escalated.

Spokesman Mohagher Iqbal said the MILF still believes in peace.

“The peace process is important to us,” he said in a statement. “It has brought us the promise of a good life for our people.”

The governor of what is currently the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao has urged the government not to abandon the peace process despite calls to the contrary from various sectors.

""Let us not give up,"" said Governor Mujiv Hataman. ""Let us continue working for an enduring peace in Mindanao. Let us continue the peace process.""

The Catholic Bishops' Conference this week added its voice to the calls for peace and offered its assistance.

""We hold it to be morally obligatory for the government and for the restive segments of Philippine society to search for the paths of peace,"" Archbishop Socrates Villegas, president of the bishops' conference, said in a statement.

That path to peace is still uncertain, especially for those most closely intertwined with the conflict.

The village of Tukanalipao sits near the scene of the fateful clash. The murmur of the nearby river and the rustling of corn leaves in the wind offer a semblance of peace. But on January 25, a burst of gunfire pierced the silence and changed Lyn-Lyn Sandigan’s life forever.

When fighting erupted early that Sunday morning, her husband stood up, grabbed his gun, rushed to the river and paddled into the darkness in a wooden canoe. He never came back.

Mamariza Sandigan was a Moro rebel fighter and though he was not listed among the official dead, Lyn-Lyn said he perished in the battle.

“My husband was a rebel, but we also wanted peace,” she said.","Tue, 17 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.ucanews.com/uploads/2015/02/1424146962.jpg,"['tutin', 'following', 'peace', 'bloodshed', 'moro', 'rebels', 'war', 'philippines', 'fighting', 'spreads', 'rebel', 'uncertainty', 'maguindanao', 'process', 'milf']",

They are being improved under the Irrigation Rehabilitation and Development Project (IRDP), under the Ministry of Energy and Water. With support from the World Bank and Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, the project builds upon and scales up activities supported under the completed World Bank-financed Emergency Irrigation Rehabilitation Project, closed in December 2012.

Better access to irrigation and jobs

IRDP supports rehabilitation of irrigation systems serving some 300,000 hectares of land throughout the country, as well as the design and construction of a limited number of small multi-purpose dams and related works, while establishing hydro-meteorological facilities and services. To date, under the irrigation component of this project, approximately 20,000 hectares (44 percent of the target 45,000 hectares) of incremental irrigated area have been achieved.

According to Project Manager Engineer Mirwais Ghoriani, the Sangbast village canal was successfully completed in April 2013 at a cost of little over Afghani 10 million (US$175,000).

“Our assessment revealed a drastic need for water canal development here,” says Mirwais. “With this project now implemented, farmlands are better irrigated and people have access to more job opportunities.”

Padar, a 40-year-old farmer and father of four children, cultivates various crops on one hectare of land in partnership with other farmers. He says prior to the implementation of IRDP in his village he was not willing to cultivate his land from fear of lack of water; however, now he has even succeeded convincing some friends to become his partners.

“This sub-project began last year. Prior to that, we could hardly block water overflow from the river. We would go out and work on the intake for 10 to 15 days. We also had to buy sandbags. My contribution alone was around $100,” he says.

Water in all seasons

Fazel Ahmad, 50, a farmer from Ghalmaran village, says he does not remember ever having had enough water for irrigation in the fall season in the past, especially when the old reservoir filled up with mud sedimentation. Although the old reservoir still fills up with mud, farmers are now able to irrigate their lands even during fall season following the improvement made in the canal scheme.

“We are relieved now. All we need to do is pile up a few sandbags against the wall and the water will stay in the reservoir. Whenever water is needed, we pull up the main hatch and direct the water to whatever secondary canal system we wish,” explains Fazel. “There are a total of nine hatches in different directions. If we do not want water in a certain direction, we simply close the concerned hatch and the water stays inside.”","Mon, 09 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/share-logo/social-share.jpg,"['land', 'project', 'system', 'allows', 'farmers', 'village', 'improved', 'reservoir', 'flow', 'control', 'canal', 'water', 'rehabilitation', 'hectares', 'irrigation']",

The day ended with 56-year old Daw Khin Win shot dead and two other villagers injured as police opened fire with live ammunition on local protesters.

The bloody day in December was only the latest violent incident to mar the Letpadaung project, part of a larger mining complex located in Monywa, Sagaing Region. People living around the massive Letpadaung mine have long protested against forced evictions, occupation of farmland and the environmental damage wrought by the project.

In 2012, white phosphorus incendiary munitions were fired at protesters, inflicting injuries including severe burns on more than 100 people including Buddhist monks who were demonstrating against the project.

A comprehensive report released Tuesday by London-based campaign group Amnesty International — outlining a litany of violations linked to the project — adds to a long list of accusations that rights abuses continue under the nominally civilian government that came to power in Myanmar in 2011. But the report is also potentially damaging to the government’s efforts to show that extractive projects in the country can be conducted responsibly.

The report, titled Open for Business? Corporate Crime and Abuses at Myanmar Copper Mine, runs to more than 200 pages in length and “exposes how Myanmar offers the perfect storm of a rich natural resource base and a weak regulatory framework that has allowed foreign and Myanmar companies to engage in and profit from serious human rights abuses,” it says.

“The Monywa project is a cautionary tale for the government of Myanmar and investors. Foreign investment cannot benefit Myanmar when such contexts prevail.”

The project dates back to the 1990s, when Canadian firm Ivanhoe Mines (now known as Turquoise Hill Resources) entered a joint venture with the Myanmar government to develop vast copper deposits beneath the earth. The mine is now owned jointly by the Myanmar government, a Myanmar military-owned company and Wanbao Mining, part of Norinco, a Chinese state-owned conglomerate that manufactures weapons.

The report decries a lack of transparency at every stage, from the lack of public consultation to a failure to disclose environmental risks to the “opaque sale of assets” that has not been explained by the entities involved. It warns that breaches of business rules and regulations have been tolerated by authorities.

“When business operations breach law with impunity it encourages further illegal conduct and human rights abuses,” the report says. “It is essential that governments ensure transparency and accountability to prevent a cycle of corporate crimes and human rights abuses”.

The publication of the report comes as Myanmar is hoping to be accepted to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), an international scheme that seeks to ensure deals done to extract oil, gas or mineral resources are open to scrutiny.

“We hope the findings of the report are taken up by the EITI Board and that the government of Myanmar is asked to demonstrate its commitment to transparency by making details of the Monywa project sale and other information around contracts and company ownership public,” said lead author Meghna Abraham, deputy director of global thematic issues at Amnesty International.

Countries that are members of EITI are seen as a safer bet for reputation-conscious international investors, and as Myanmar welcomes foreign competition, damaging accusations of rights abuses linked to investment could be a major barrier to the county reaping greater revenues from its natural riches.

Investment is ramping up in the offshore oil and gas sector, with new deals being signed for global firms like Royal Dutch Shell to explore for hydrocarbons off the coast. Onshore, however, many of Myanmar’s natural resources — which include gold and other metals, jade, rubies and vast tracts of untouched forests — are found in areas where the majority of the population belong to ethnic minorities.

In northern Myanmar’s Kachin state, resources are seen as a driver of the ongoing violence between ethnic rebels and the government, which has flared up in recent months. Late last year, companies — whose identities are not released publicly — resumed using large-scale machinery to mine jade in Hpakant Township after a three-year hiatus. But recent clashes in the area, likely fueled by the jade trade, have forced many mines to close once again.

Civil Society’s Voice

Following Daw Khin Win’s shooting at the Letpadaung mine, a statement issued by the Myanmar Alliance for Transparency and Accountability (MATA), said the incident “hinders implementation of the EITI mechanism in Myanmar”.

The group, which was set up by local civil society organizations to manage their involvement in the EITI application process, said it would raise concerns about the government’s handling of the Letpadaung project.

“We recommend that when the EITI board considers Myanmar’s application to EITI they take into account the due diligence, accountability and transparency of the Government of Myanmar in handling this case,” the statement said.

And MATA’s voice is important. The EITI application calls for the country to create an “enabling environment” for civil society involvement in the process, and groups are able to cry foul if their concerns are not listened to, potentially derailing the application.

MATA technical advisor and steering committee member Wong Aung said that Letpadaung was just one case of activists facing difficulties when they challenge mining and other projects across Myanmar. Many have been prevented by local authorities from holding educational forums about EITI or other resource issues, he said.

“There are so many problems, but they are happening outside of Yangon and Naypyidaw. To hold training or workshops in the remote areas, we need permission,” said Wong Aung, also known for his work as director of the Shwe Gas Movement.

Activists have been jailed under laws limiting the right to protest or using trespassing laws, with the number of people in Myanmar’s jails considered political prisoners swelling over the past year.

Wong Aung warned that the international community could be “ambushed” by a government that may be taking part in EITI only to clean up its image and attract more investment, while continuing to stifle efforts toward accountability.

As for transparency, the Myanmar government had shared the details of some large-scale mining projects, Wong Aung said. But, despite encouragement to adopt a transparent approach ahead of EITI membership as a show of good faith, much information is still not available.

Untouchables

Activists are especially concerned since many large projects are thought to be linked to powerful individuals or families. Even parliamentarians — many of whom have known links to business interests — have not been forced to disclose their assets. “The government tries to protect them,” Wong Aung said. “There is a big wall. We need to break it down.”

Win Myo Thu, director of local environmental group EcoDev, agreed that confronting vested interests would be the real test of the Myanmar government’s commitment to transparency.

“So far, we’ve found that if something is wrong in the extractive industries, the government will try to solve the problem,” he said. “But if we try to touch the untouchable people, they are still above the law.”

Global Witness, a UK-based watchdog that is a member of EITI’s international board, is pushing for Myanmar’s government to take civil society participation in the EITI process seriously.

“If EITI delivers on its promise of prising open Myanmar’s extractive industries it could begin to redress the power imbalance between the elite that is currently benefiting and the rest of the population,” said Mike Davis, a senior advisor at Global Witness.

“But even in the best case scenario, EITI will not provide a silver bullet solution to the many injustices and abuses that have characterized Myanmar’s oil gas and mining industries for so long. It is a potential catalyst for a change and a milestone on the long road to genuine accountability,” said Davis.

“However those government officials, international donors and CSOs [civil society organizations] involved all risk generating or experiencing severe disappointment if they treat Myanmar’s EITI process as an end in itself,” he added.

Important to Myanmar’s success in applying to EITI is a report to be submitted to EITI next year by a multi-stakeholder panel comprised of NGOs and the government.

Win Myo Thu, a member of the panel, warned that civil society representatives would not baulk at using its position in the EITI process to ensure the government makes improvements.

“If we find there is so much injustice, if we feel we are manipulated by the government, we will stop EITI,” he said.

“One accusation is the government just does it for legitimacy. If this is just part of their legitimacy plan, and there is no real engagement or transparency, including for these ‘untouchable’ people, then we have to reconsider.”","Tue, 10 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.ucanews.com/uploads/2015/02/1423542274.jpg,"['troubled', 'tale', 'report', 'mining', 'investors', 'project', 'copper', 'society', 'eiti', 'transparency', 'international', 'abuses', 'myanmars', 'myanmar', 'cautionary']",

31,31,FL-2015-000010-IDN,Why it's OK to swear on social media—and other tips for tweeting disasters - Science AAAS,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/02/why-its-ok-swear-social-media-and-other-tips-tweeting-disasters,"SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA—When Hurricane Sandy hit the eastern United States in 2012, the disaster inspired at least 22 million original tweets. Social media isn’t always accurate—Reddit's targeting of the wrong suspect in the 2013 Boston bombings is one cautionary example—but the barrage of data produced by Twitter and Facebook can be immensely useful to emergency responders and researchers studying crises, and point to innovative crisis management. So said Leysia Palen, a computer and information scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, at a session here yesterday at the annual meeting of AAAS (which publishes Science). Based on her studies of disasters such as the Haiti earthquake, Hurricane Katrina, and the devastating Colorado floods in 2013, Palen has several tips for using Twitter and other social media platforms to help others respond to a crisis.

1. Be specific

People new to Twitter and Facebook often say things like, “it's very smoky here,” when describing a fire, Palen says. ""But we don't know where 'here' is."" People need to communicate where they are and what the experience is like, she says: ""Is it smoky in a way that feels unhealthy; is it smoky in a way that suddenly changed because the wind changed?""

A ""perfect"" tweet or Facebook post might include a photograph of local conditions, a description explaining exactly what the image shows and where and when it was taken, she says. Although much of that information can be found in metadata, descriptive information about how, when, and where a post was created, ""not everyone knows that that metadata exists,"" or how to find it, she says. Palen and other researchers are developing apps that can automatically format such detail during crises and insert it into maps with layers and time scales.

There are situations when providing such detail doesn't make sense, Palen notes. If you want to keep your location or other personal information private—during a violent political conflict, for example—it's a good idea to avoid using easy-to-find hashtags or tagging your location.

2. Be yourself

Cold hard facts are vital to disaster response, but the importance of emotion and personal experience shouldn't be discounted, Palen says. In her lab's analyses of social media responses to disaster, ""we used to throw out tweets that had swear words in them—not because we were sensitive, but because we thought they were less likely to contain valuable information,"" she says. Eventually, however, she realized that swearing can actually be a key signal of how serious things are on the ground. ""People use swear words all the time to convey worry and excitement and fear,"" she says. The algorithms she and her colleagues use to analyze the flood of social media responses are actually particularly good at detecting sentiments like anxiety, she says, so she wouldn't want people experiencing disasters to flatten their responses in an attempt to be more objective, she says. ""I sort of want people to be as they are.""

3. Engage from afar

It's unrealistic to expect people in the midst of a hurricane to stop and carefully compose a self-contained 140-character tweet, but people who are monitoring a disaster out of harm's way can help fill in information gaps, Palen says. One helpful way to engage on social media during a disaster is to ask those on the ground for more detail, she says. Another is to become an information gatherer or check others' facts—roles which are much easier for people in relative safety to perform than those who are in the midst of fleeing their homes, she says. Based on her research of the social media response to the Colorado floods, Palen says one indication that a Twitter user is a valuable source is that they collect large numbers of followers in a short amount of time and are responsive to corrections from their audience, Palen says. ""They're more likely to be reliable if they say, 'Ah, I was wrong, this is the correct information at this point in time.' "" Other new social media platforms, such as programs that allow volunteers to produce more detailed maps of disaster zones using donated satellite imagery or to match photos of lost pets to older images provided by their owners, also provide opportunities for people to help without putting themselves in harm's way, she says.

33,33,FL-2015-000010-IDN,Dead Sea Living - Jadaliyya,https://www.jadaliyya.com/Details/31764,"Dead Sea Living, directed by German Gutierrez. Canada/France/Palestine, 2013.

Although the Dead Sea has no life, it provides living through the rich minerals extracted from it. Yet the flood of water into the Dead Sea is slowly receding. It has witnessed a ninety-foot drop in only thirty years on a lake that is just sixty-seven kilometers long and twenty kilometers wide. At this rate, the Dead Sea will bottom out as a small pond in about fifty years.

German Gutierrez’s film Dead Sea Living depicts the dying of the Dead Sea and its economic, environmental, social, and political implications. Gutrierrez is a Colombian film director currently based in Canada who has made other documentaries, including the Coca Cola Case (2009), Who Shot my Brother? (2009), and Societies Under the Influence (1999). The original idea for Dead Sea Living came from Palestinian film director George Khleifi and other colleagues in 2009. In a recent interview, Khleifi said: “we witnessed the changing reality around the Dead Sea. We used to sit three steps away from the water of the Dead Sea on the terrace at the Lido Beach. Now, the sea receded six hundred to seven hundred meters and you cannot walk in that area as it is full of sinkholes. These six hundred to seven hundred meters are actually what used to be the bottom of the Sea.” He added that living in the region makes you aware of the water crisis, since water is under Israeli control and there are constant water cuts in the summer.[1] Khleifi wrote and pitched the original project and received support mainly from the European television network Arte and Radio Canada.

The documentary crosses traditional lines to reach audiences interested in the link between socioeconomic and political conditions and environmental sustainability. It also crosses geographic lines between the Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian areas around the Dead Sea, shifting between photographing the main sites of the Dead Sea, Jordan River, and Sea of Galilee to interviewing officials, as well as, people whose daily lives are directly affected by the changes taking place.

The film portrays a stunning landscape of the Dead Sea and the surrounding areas. As the film’s photography employs panoramic and aerial imagery showing the rich ecological and historic context, it zooms into the political reality that is contributing to its obliteration. The film moves between narratives that invoke both biblical connotations as well as colonization and domination. It simultaneously contrasts life and death, the revival of the Dead Sea and its demise.

The dying of the Dead Sea is a result of the drying up of the Jordan River, which used to feed the Dead Sea from the Sea of Galilee. The Jordan River is believed to be the site of Jesus’ baptism. It attracts pilgrims from all over the world who come to both the Jordanian and the Israeli sides of the river to be baptized. But the Jordan River’s water, as Gidon Bromberg of Friends of the Earth Israel puts it in the film, “is anything but holy.” The water bottles sold at the Israeli baptism site have a warning label indicating that they are “for religious use only, do not drink.” This water, adds Bromberg, is a polluted mixture of sewage, brine, and runoff from fish farms and agricultural operations.

As countries in the region compete for fresh water, the Dead Sea has had the tap shut off from both ends.[2] In the north, Jordan, Syria, and Israel have cut off the Jordan River; in the south, two massive mineral extraction operations occupy the entire southern basin of the Dead Sea: the Arab Potash Company in Jordan and the Dead Sea Works in Israel. The Canada Potash Company is a shareholder in both. The film portrays how these mineral extraction industries are accelerating the rate of evaporation of the existing waters.

The Dead Sea is in fact one of the most profitable mines in the world. In addition, the resort and tourist businesses that have been recently established along its cost were created by the potash industry. The film ironically depicts how the tourism pools—where people come from all over the world to float in, and seek the health remedies of, the minerals of the Dead Sea—are nothing but a one-square-kilometer reservoir created by the nearby chemical plants.

The camera simultaneously shows naked women tanning in an Israeli Dead Sea resort alongside depictions of the plight of Palestinians who do not have enough water to survive, let alone enjoy the luxury of access to the Dead Sea. Palestinian access to the area has been severely restricted since the early 1990s. According to the Oslo Accords, the Western aquifer in the West Bank is shared by Israel and the Palestinians, while the Eastern aquifer is exclusively Palestinian, though in fact it is totally controlled by Israel through the mechanisms of its occupation. Agriculture in the West Bank constitutes thirty to thirty-five percent of Palestinian GDP, and as a result, the Palestinian economy is much more vulnerable to a water shortage than Israel’s.[3] In comparison, the film portrays how sixty percent of Israel’s water goes to agriculture, for a revenue of two percent of its GDP, while Jordan uses seventy percent of its water for agriculture, for a revenue of approximately four percent of its GDP. Gidon Bromberg has noted in the film that it was “nonsensical” (and not sustainable) to grow bananas in the desert.

The film contrasts the conditions of the Palestinian farmers who are denied the right to dig wells with those in the Israeli settlements in the West Bank who are permitted to drill wells deep enough to tap the mountain aquifer. By blocking the Jordan River’s borders, Israel has also blocked the access to the river for Palestinian farmers from villages such as Bardala and Ein Al-Baida. Palestinians in the Jordan Valley villages must live on only fifty liters of water per day. That is about half of what the World Health Organization considers as the minimum for human sustainability. By contrast, Israelis on average have access to about 350 liters of water/day.[4]

In the film, Palestinian farmer Abu Saqr, from Al-Hadidiyeh in the Jordan Valley, indicates that the sonic bombs of the Israeli military destroyed a well for collecting rain and that he is prevented from fixing it. The camera immediately moves between Abu Saqr’s land and the neighboring Israeli settlement, Moshav Ro’i, where settlers plant flowers for export to Europe. While the cost of the water, subsidized by the Israeli government, is three Israeli New Sheqels (INS) per cubic meter for agriculture and seven to eight INS for home use at the settlement, Abu Saqr has to wait for two weeks for water delivery and pays twenty-seven INS per cubic meter. Uri Shani, who previously served as the head of the Water Authority in Israel, says in an interview in the film that in Area C, according to the Oslo Agreements, Palestinians need permission to dig, as they are “unfortunately under occupation.” Shaddad Attili, Minister and Head of the Palestinian Water Authority, complains in a subsequent scene that he cannot lay a simple pipe in the West Bank without permission from Israel.

The film vividly portrays how the Palestinians are the weakest side in any of the negotiations surrounding access to the Dead Sea and control of the water flowing into it. According to Khleifi, “The Oslo Agreements are clearly biased towards Israel and a number of mistakes were made by the Palestinians in the negotiations in regard to control over water.""[5] He described to me the severe water shortages in the Hebron and Bethlehem areas and the draconian restrictions imposed by the Israeli Civil (read military) Administration in regard to digging wells. “The technicalities of the Israeli occupation in delaying authorizations for Palestinians to dig wells could lead to months, if not years, of delays, as every request needs to go through at least ten departments.”[6]

Dead Sea Living links the shrinking and disappearance of the Dead Sea with the overall problem of fresh water for people in the region. The film ends by showing how politics and environmental protection policies are contested when attempting to find a solution to the Dead Sea problem. Environmentalists suggest restoring the Jordan River instead of creating canals that will connect the Red and/or Mediterranean Sea to the Dead Sea. This could prevent the unpredictable side effects of these new canals, and lead to more conservation policies in Jordan, Syria, and Israel that could in turn revive the Jordan River. Yet, as long as both Israel and Jordan are growing food and flowers for the supermarkets of Europe while draining the aquifers to do it, and while the mineral companies are draining the Dead Sea for short-term profit-making endeavors, conservation efforts will remain limited. Most importantly, as long as the Israeli occupation and building of settlements are in place , and as long as wars in Iraq and Syria continue to bring more refugees into Jordan, conservation policies will remain subordinated to geopolitical concerns. The film clearly shows that any proposed solution has to take into account sustainability, not just to the Dead Sea and the Jordan River, but to the dignity of all people living in the area.

34,34,FL-2015-000010-IDN,Massive project maps DNA tags that define each cell's identity - Science AAAS,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/02/massive-project-maps-dna-tags-define-each-cells-identity,"Our DNA may encode all the instructions needed to build the human body and keep it running, but each of our cells must follow just a subset of those instructions in order for the body to work properly. Thanks to the $300 million, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap Epigenomics Project, researchers have now identified most of the chemical tags on DNA and its associated proteins that influence gene function and help define more than 100 different kinds of human cells. The knowledge of these so-called epigenetic modifications has already led to new insights into Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, and development.

Hundreds of publications have already used the epigenetic data the project has gathered over the past 8 years, and today, more than 20 reports appear in Nature and its associated journals. The flood of studies marks the official end of the project, but researchers predict they will be using its information on how genes are regulated for years to come.

""The reality is that it's very challenging to understand the genetic basis of disease,"" says Janine LaSalle, an epigeneticist at the University of California (UC), Davis, who was not involved in the project. Because of its complexity, ""it's really important to have the Roadmap.""

When the human genome was deciphered more than a decade ago, researchers already knew that there was a layer of control to gene function beyond the sequence of the DNA: an epigenome. ""Epi"" means ""on, upon, at, by, or near"" and includes molecules that latch on to the DNA or stick to the proteins that surround DNA and make up the chromosome. These chemical tags include so-called methyl or acetyl groups; they don't change the DNA sequence itself, but they can make the DNA nearby fold or unfold, blocking access to a gene so it can't turn on, or exposing a gene so it can be activated. In doing so, the epigenome helps determine the genes a cell can use, turning it, for example, into a liver cell or neuron.

""By studying the epigenomes of cells, we come to learn about how they became what they are,"" says Christopher Glass, a genomics scientist at UC San Diego who was not involved in the work. And unlike a person’s genome sequence, the epigenome can readily change in response to diet, disease, and environment factors, allowing cells—and therefore the body—to adjust to new conditions.

But until recently, epigenomes were hard to decipher. An earlier NIH-funded project called ENCODE helped develop several efficient techniques for determining epigenomes by marking the places along each chromosome where methyl groups and other epigenetic modifications attached. But that project focused on so-called cell lines, immortalized versions of cells that can grow indefinitely in lab dishes. Those cells don't necessarily accurately reflect what's happening in normal cells, Glass says, so the Roadmap project instead examined samples taken from the body directly, such as cells from the heart, liver, kidney, muscle, intestines, skin, fat, and brain, as well as fetal tissue. In addition, some of the project's investigators tested several kinds of stem cells and even sampled stem cells as they differentiated into nerve cells or other tissues.

When the teams were done mapping and comparing the epigenomes of these 111 tissues and cells, they were able to define active and inactive regions of each cell type's genome. They were also able to pinpoint active regulatory DNA called enhancers, which are under the sway of epigenetic tags and control where and when different genes are expressed. In any given cell type, about 5% of the epigenome regulates gene expression, report Manolis Kellis, a computational scientist at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his colleagues online today in Nature. Further analyses indicated that enhancers specific to particular cell types ""appear to be where the major action is for disease,"" LaSalle says. These enhancers are often located where large-scale population studies of genetic variation—so-called genome-wide association studies—pinpoint an increased risk of disease.

Kellis and his colleagues also found a surprise in enhancers involved with Alzheimer’s disease. They looked at the epigenome and patterns of gene expression in the brain cells of a mouse as they underwent degeneration akin to Alzheimer’s disease. They then compared what they found with the epigenome and gene activity of the brains of Alzheimer's patients who recently died. The analysis showed that enhancers and genes involved in nervous system activity tended to become less active in both the diseased mouse and the human, but that enhancers that turn on immune response genes revved up.

""That is not what we would have predicted in Alzheimer’s and may be a new wrinkle that might be helpful"" for understanding or treating the disease, says Henk Stunnenberg, an epigenomicist at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, who was not involved with the work. Adds Glass: ""The brain studies suggest that this could be a very valuable approach for approaching many complex diseases going forward.""

Bing Ren, a molecular geneticist at the San Diego branch of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, and colleagues studied another important aspect of the epigenome. To fit into a nucleus, the DNA is tightly folded but unfurls at some spots to allow specific genes to be activated. His group has mapped these folding patterns in developing stem cells and found them to be changing quite a bit in some places. The work indicates that enhancers play an important role in shaping the 3D structure of the DNA, the team reports.

In many ways, though officially over, the Roadmap Epigenomics Project is just a beginning. There are hundreds of other cell types waiting to be mapped, as well as to be studied under different conditions and at different time points, and an international consortium has set it sights on generating 1000 epigenomes in the next few years. And there's much left to be done with the information already gathered, Glass says. Although ""this effort generated a huge amount of data, they've left most of the work of testing the hypotheses [generated] for people who will read these papers.""","Wed, 18 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/sn-DNAroadmapH.jpg?itok=j0-5pjLI,"['define', 'genes', 'identity', 'disease', 'gene', 'project', 'epigenome', 'massive', 'enhancers', 'dna', 'cells', 'tags', 'cell', 'work', 'maps']",

They did not.

It is unlikely that the rubber tapper and his family — from Jelebu in Negri Sembilan — will have meat for their celebrations, as they try to stretch every ringgit following the decline in commodity prices.

Lan Siew, who is in his 50s, said on a recent visit to Simpang Pertang that he had been tapping rubber for more than 10 years but is now hit hard by the massive drop in the global price of rubber to below two ringgit per kilogram.

“With the help of my wife, we share a daily income of 150 ringgit that is split between us and the plantation owners. This means we get only 75 ringgit, each of us having earned 37 ringgit for the day,"" he said.

The income he earns from tapping rubber is based on the current price of 1.90 ringgit per kilogram.

Lan Siew and his wife wake up at 5am daily, if it does not rain, and work until 10am tapping rubber in a plantation owned by his boss, who stays in a house that is just 300 meters from their own.

Being in a financial bind and unable to afford meat for this year's reunion dinner, Lan Siew said he hoped that his three children will be able to lift the family out of its economic distress.

“What choice do we have? What you earn is what you get. If you tapped more rubber on that particular day, then good. But if it is little, you have to deal with it,” he said.

“Sometimes, I have to borrow money from my friends. What am I to do? I’d rather not tell my children, I don’t want them to worry,” he added.

Lan Siew lives near the Pertang New Village, a neighborhood of 300 people who are mostly rubber smallholders and have their own plots of up to three acres. Most of them are above the age of 40, as the younger adults have left to seek different careers in the cities.

Some of the smallholders interviewed said the rubber industry used to be very lucrative for them, especially in 2012, when rubber prices reached a high of six ringgit per kilogram, and tappers could easily bag monthly incomes of up to 10,000 ringgit.

However, today, even foreign workers who tap rubber are ditching the job for better prospects elsewhere, they said.

Lai Swee Moi, a rubber wholesaler, said some foreign workers quit the rubber industry because plantation owners underpaid them.

Even for her, she said, keeping a wholesale business alive was a struggle as she had to cushion herself from competition by six other retailers who operate in the nearby Kelawang district, also in Jelebu.

“Who wants to tap rubber nowadays? Young people have obviously left for cities to seek better jobs,” she said.

Then Kooi, a restaurant operator in Pertang who used to tap rubber a decade ago, said he too had found the work unprofitable.

“With prices floating between one ringgit and two ringgit, carrying 10kg of rubber would only generate a maximum of 20 ringgit in profit.

“Half goes to the plantation owners and the other half goes to you, which means you only get 10 ringgit. The reward is not worth the effort at all,” he said.

Some tappers have resorted to finding alternative sources of income, like Liow Ha Loo who plants vegetables for her family's own consumption as well as to sell in the local market.

“During the floods in the east coast last year, I was able to sell some of my vegetables due to the supply shortage in the market, and the profits made up 50 percent of my income,"" she said.

The older a person gets, she said, the harder it becomes to tap rubber and this affected one's income. Other factors that contribute to unstable incomes include the age of the tree and geographic conditions of the plantation, she added.

“Usually, covering three acres of land can yield about 50kg to 60kg of rubber. I covered 11 acres today and got 200kg, Liow said, adding that she had started work at 3am that day.

Chinese New Year festivities for Liow, however, will be brighter than it is for Lan Siew's family.

Liow's children, who have contributed to the family's budget for the celebrations, will be returning home from their jobs elsewhere, and will be buying the lantern, snacks and other traditional Chinese delicacies, she said.

From a plantation owner's perspective, however, the government can play a role in helping buffer rubber tappers from economic hardship by intervening in the local price of rubber.

Plantation bosses also struggle to stay afloat, said Chan Hok Chun, who owns a plantation in Kelewang. He noted that rubber prices in Thailand were set at between three to four ringgit per kilogram.

“The price of rubber fluctuates so rapidly,” Chan said, pointing out that it can rise and fall small amounts depending on the day.

“Just look at the price of rubber now. I would be happy to earn 1,000 ringgit every month looking at the current state,"" Chan said.

National news agency Bernama reported on February 5 that Malaysia would host a meeting of ministers from rubber-producing countries this May.

The meeting is to develop strategies to stabilize the commodity's price in the global market, Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Douglas Uggah Embas was reported as saying.

“Cella” was not enthusiastic about starting work at Jet’s Pizza, in Mansfield, on Saturday and showed it by tweeting: “Ew, I start this f*** a** job tomorrow” with a line of thumbs down emojis.

The fact she did not name the restaurant on Twitter did not stop a staff member seeing her tweet, taking a screen shot and sending it to her manager-to-be, Robert Waple.

Unimpressed, he replied the next day, writing: “No you don't start that FA job today! I just fired you! Good luck with your no money, no job life!”

After Cella tweeted that she had been fired on Twitter, the exchange quickly went viral, reaching Venezuela, Argentina, Peru and Indonesia according to comments.

Some people cast doubts on the authenticity of the manager's account Mr Waple, who is listed as Jet Pizza's owner on LinkedIn, publicly defended himself.

“Working register (the till), taking phone orders, making subs/salads. Eating free pizza. How hard would that have been?” he asked.

“I would've just called her and fired her, but I wasn't at work and didn't have her number… probably one of the dumbest things to say about a job you haven't started yet.”

Cella later tweeted that she called Jet Pizza and another manager confirmed that she had indeed been fired before her first shift.

Mr Waple’s reply prompted a flood of criticism on Twitter, with former employees crawling out of the woodwork to tell him what they thought of working at his pizzeria.

“Just thought you should know I was stoned out of my mind every time I went into work, and your pizza sucks,” one wrote.

“Being high would only partly explain how you could deliver a pizza to the wrong house...multiple times,” his former manager replied.

Cella did not seem upset to lose her job, saying she was “not mad” and sending Mr Waple a cartoon of herself playing with stacks of cash.

“Made my point today,” he wrote. “I'll check in again in 6 years.”","Mon, 09 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/09/15/15/pizza.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['pizza', 'waple', 'went', 'gets', 'teenager', 'starting', 'tweeted', 'twitter', 'today', 'job', 'fired', 'manager', 'work', 'pizzeria']",

KUNLONG, MYANMAR – Unknown attackers shot and wounded two people on Tuesday in the first-ever assault on a Red Cross convoy in Myanmar where battles have raged in the northeast between government soldiers and ethnic insurgents over two weeks, a Reuters witness said.

One person was shot near the eye and another in the body when the convoy of eight vehicles, which were marked with the emblem of the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS), came under fire, the witness said.

The convoy was attempting to transport civilians displaced by fighting in Laukkai, a town in the Kokang region, on the border with China.

""We haven't had such an attack before,"" said Shwe Cin Myint, an MRCS spokeswoman. ""This would be the very first.""

Fighting broke out on Feb 9 between the Myanmar army and a group called the called the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and thousands of civilians have fled the area, either to other areas in Myanmar or over the border into China.

The clashes have alarmed China, which fears an influx of villagers fleeing violence and called this week for peace on the border.

At least 47 Myanmar soldiers and 26 MNDAA fighters have been killed since Feb 9, the state-backed Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported.

The MNDAA was formerly part of the Communist Party of Burma, a powerful China-backed guerrilla force that battled the Myanmar government until the group splintered in 1989.

Fighting between the rebels and the army in 2009 pushed tens of thousands of refugees into southwestern China, angering the government in Beijing.

The fighting and heavy casualties are a setback for government efforts to forge a nationwide ceasefire and end a patchwork of insurgencies that have bedevilled Myanmar since shortly after its independence in 1948.","Tue, 17 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20150217/c1_477630_150217210445_700.jpg,"['attack', 'feb', '1stever', 'convoy', 'army', 'wounded', 'red', 'laukkai', 'called', 'kokang', 'cross', 'myanmar']",

Entering this meaningless debate, Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has added his weight to the view that this would be ' China 's Century', forgetting that when it comes to global power relations, the past is no guide to the future.Merely because Imperial Britain dominated the 19th century and the United States dominated the 20th, many analysts have been in search of the defining power of the 21st. This is not just an ahistorical analysis, but it is innocent of the changing dynamics of global power equations.Britain's dominance of the 19th century was on account of the fact that it was not only the locus of economic activity based on new technologies, but was also the dominant military power. With the decline of Britain, the defeat of Germany and the end of colonialism and the liberation of hitherto colonised nations, European nations saw their power recede in the 20th century. On the other hand, the rise of the US as a techno-economic and military power, and of global alliances that enabled it to project power around the world, ensured that America emerged as last century's dominant power.The 21st century is, however, different. With the end of colonialism and the rupture of neo-colonial dependencies, thanks to the rise of several new post-colonial states around the world — called emerging economies — global prosperity and power have become more dispersed.No one nation can hope to dominate the world quite the way that imperial Britain or post-War US did. Thus, the proponents of the view that one or another nation — the US or China — will dominate the world seems oblivious to the multiplicity of the sources of prosperity and power that are shaping an increasingly 'multipolar' world.Consider first the shortcoming of the purely statistical argument. Merely because China is set to overtake the US as the world's largest economy in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, Stiglitz, like many, has raised alarm and asked America to wake up. PPP estimates are helpful for a variety of reasons. But they do not define the real dimension of that middle P — power. China's purchasing power is enormous and rising but there just isn't enough purchase yet in that kind of power.Britain and the US dominated their centuries because the former had its colonies and the latter its allies. China has a long way to go in acquiring that kind of military power and global political influence.As the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) annual publication, The Military Balance, has reminded its readers for some time now, the annual defence budget of the US is more than the combined defence budgets of the next nine powers (China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Britain, France, Japan, India, Germany and South Korea, in that order). While China's defence budget is rising, that of Russia is declining. More importantly, among the top 10 defence spenders, six are US allies and India and Russia are independent powers. Even if Russia teams up with China, the two cannot dominate this century quite the same way the US and its allies still do.Of course, China has already emerged as the world's biggest manufacturer and trading power. But to retain that position China has to maintain cordial relations with almost all the top 10 military powers — its major markets. Most importantly, however, China does not have the colonies that Britain had in the 19th century (unless we classify Tibet as a Chinese colony and Taiwan is annexed) nor does it have the kind of allies that the US continues to have. Finally, China has yet to acquire energy independence or, in its absence, military control over sources of energy and maritime control over energy supply routes.So, for all his economic brilliance, Stiglitz is simply wrong. What can, however, be claimed without doubt is that the 21st Century will be 'Asia's Century'. That is, if the 19th century was Western Europe's and the 20th that of North America, the 21st century will be that of Asia to India's East — what Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has dubbed 'the Indo-Pacific'.Consider the Asia of which India and Japan are the 'bookends', so to speak, including China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the Asean nations and India (and perhaps Bangladesh and Sri Lanka). This entire region is not only increasing its share of world income and trade but also of defence spending. Increased defence spending need not destabilise Asia if all concerned recognise the benefits of peace and stability. There are internal tensions within this region but the chances of war are remote, unlike in the Asia to India's west.China will remain on top of this pile, but it would be balanced both by residual US power and Asia's secondary powers — Japan, India, Vietnam, Korea and Indonesia. If, together they ensure that peace prevails, the 21st century will be Asia's. But, if conflict breaks out it would be neither Asia's nor China's.(The writer is Director for Geo-economics and Strategy, International Institute for Strategic Studies)","Thu, 19 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-46294750,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-129696,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg","['cant', 'power', 'india', 'super', 'dominating', '21st', 'global', 'china', 'military', 'world', 'defence', 'century', 'britain']", 
42,42,FL-2015-000010-IDN,In the eye of a mega-drought: Researchers warn US should prepare for - The Independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/eye-mega-drought-researchers-warn-us-should-prepare-unprecedented-drought-conditions-unlike-anything-past-1-000-years-10045747.html,"Since the turn of this century, the US south-west has spent more than a decade in drought. Last year was the warmest on record in California, which is in the middle of its driest spell for more than 400 years. But according to a new scientific study, that’s nothing compared to what comes next.

In the paper, published by the journal Science Advances, researchers from Nasa and Columbia and Cornell universities warn that a vast swathe of the US, including the south-west states and the central plains, should prepare for “unprecedented drought conditions” unlike anything in the past 1,000 years.

Within 35 years, the region’s millennia-long natural cycle of droughts and occasional rainfall is likely to bring an end to the relative dampness of the last century. The effects of that drying, the scientists warn, would be exacerbated by man-made climate change.

“Nearly every year is going to be dry toward the end of the 21st century, compared with what we think of as normal conditions now,” said Ben Cook from Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the lead author of the study. “We’re going to have to think about a much drier future in western North America.”

The long-term dry conditions could devastate the region’s agricultural capability, decimating both crops and cattle herds, and sending some food prices sky-rocketing. It would directly affect more than 60 million people from San Diego to San Antonio and from Oakland to Omaha, who depend on increasingly scant water resources and on infrastructure designed during an abnormally moist 20th century.

The scientists said the effects of a mega-drought, which would be especially pronounced in desert cities such as Las Vegas and Phoenix, should be considered a slow-motion natural disaster, of a piece with earthquakes or hurricanes.

Data discovered in tree rings shows that between the ninth and the 14th centuries, the region also endured lengthy periods of intense drought, an era referred to by paleoclimatologists as the “Medieval Climate Anomaly”, which is believed to have hastened the demise of some early civilisations. But decades of dry conditions, beginning in about 2050, could be even worse, the study predicts.

Dr Jason Smerdon, a climate scientist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and co-author of the study, said: “We are the first to do this kind of quantitative comparison between the projections and the distant past, and the story is a bit bleak. Even when selecting for the worst mega-drought dominated period, the 21st century projections make the [previous] mega-droughts seem like quaint walks through the Garden of Eden.”

A mega-drought would lead to major water shortages, which would cause vegetation to dry up, bringing about regular, massive wildfires in Arizona and California. But while the drought in California and its neighbouring states has grabbed recent headlines, the study suggests a far larger area would be hit, encompassing all, or parts, of Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana.

According to the study, there is a greater than 80 per cent chance of a mega-drought of 35 years or longer occurring in the US this century, unless swift and aggressive action is taken to alleviate the speed and impact of climate change, which would lower the risk. The authors said their research differed from other recent reports in its level of certainty about future droughts because they had taken into account the rise in carbon emissions.

Their conclusions were based on the rate of rising emissions and on complex climate simulations produced by 17 different computer models, which all broadly agreed on the results. The natural cycle, they found, would probably bring far less rain and snowfall to the region than in recent decades. But rising temperatures would also speed evaporation, shrinking the annual snowpack and parching soil.

This time last year, the President Barack Obama’s administration announced a $200m (£130m) drought aid package for California. But that will be of little use in combating the effects of a decades-long regional drought. “These mega-droughts during the 1100s and 1200s persisted for 20, 30, 40, 50 years at a time, and they were droughts that no one in US history has ever experienced,” Dr Cook said.

“The droughts people do know about, like the 1930s ‘dustbowl’ or the 1950s drought or even the ongoing drought in California and the south-west today – these are all naturally occurring droughts that are expected to last only a few years or perhaps a decade. Imagine instead the current California drought going on for another 20 years.”

Cook and Smerdon’s co-author Toby Ault, from the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell, said climate change increased the likelihood of a mega-drought “considerably”. Presenting the findings to reporters during the annual American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) conference in San Jose, California, he said: “We’re not necessarily locked into these high levels of mega-drought risk, if we take actions to slow the effects of rising greenhouse gases on global temperatures.”","Fri, 13 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/02/13/19/v2-Drought-2.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['change', 'california', 'study', 'unlike', 'dry', 'changing', 'eye', 'climate', 'warn', 'drought', 'pictures', 'megadrought', 'water', 'prepare', 'unprecedented', 'researchers', 'conditions', 'world', 'past']",

In the MPV segment, the Delica would go up against the Toyota Innova, which means that prices might be in the range of Rs 15-20 lakh.

Currently, the Mitsubishi Delica is made in some Southeast Asian markets like Indonesia. In India, the carmaker might look at manufacturing it locally to keep the price tag down.

“...We will have to work hard on pricing and localisation. If we were to import the Delica, it will cost more than Rs 30 lakh, which does not make sense. So, we are always looking at the manufacturing route to reduce costs. Initially, we can look at a localisation of 15-20 percent that can move upwards to 30-40 percent local content, later,” P Vijayan, CEO of HMFCL, told our sister publication Autocar Professional . “But all this is in the evaluation stage at present and plans can change over the next few years,” he added.

However, this is not the first time that Mitsubishi has announced plans of getting a new car here. There were announcements in the past too, which did not materialise.

Last year, Mitsubishi Motors had announced business plans for 2014-16 that revolved around bringing five new models to India. One was the Mirage hatchback that is manufactured in Thailand, but Uttam Bose, managing director of Hindustan Motor Finance Corp (HMFCL), the company that manufactures and markets Mitsubishi cars in India, said that plans of bringing the Mirage were dropped as it wasn't commercially viable and has stiff competition in India.

He, however, did confirm that the Attrage sedan may make its way here by 2017. “Studies are underway and we are working on it, then we will take some decisions."" The Attrage will come with a diesel engine mated to a manual gearbox and there will be no automatic option. This year, the company also plans to bring the new Mitsubishi Outlander and Montero SUVs in petrol guise, with both automatic and manual transmission options. The diesel variants will follow next year.

45,45,FL-2015-000010-IDN,England crush West Indies in World Cup warm-up - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1162548,"SYDNEY: Chris Woakes took five for 19 as England claimed a comfortable nine-wicket victory in their first official World Cup warm-up match after dismissing a hapless West Indies for 122 in 29.3 overs on Monday.

Openers Moeen Ali (46) and Ian Bell (35 not out) took England more than halfway to their target before their opening partnership was broken and James Taylor (25 not out) joined Bell to finish the job inside 23 overs.

West Indies had won the toss and chosen to bat on a muggy, overcast day at the Sydney Cricket Ground but a calamitous start saw them lose Chris Gayle and Darren Bravo for ducks inside the first over.

All rounder Woakes removed them both caught behind and things did not get much better for the islanders with wickets falling at regular intervals through the remainder of their 131-minute innings.

Lendl Simmons provided the only innings of any substance and a reminder of the firepower West Indies can usually rely upon with a lusty six into the second tier of the historic members’ stand.

Once he departed caught at cover by James Tredwell at midwicket for 46, though, the writing was on the wall and two overs later Woakes claimed his fifth wicket when Andre Russell holed out for seven to end the innings.

Jason Holder thought he had made an early breakthrough when he had Ali caught at backward point on seven but the batsman was called back when TV replays showed the new West Indies captain had bowled a no-ball.

Reprieved, Ali assumed the heavier workload in the opening partnership and was four runs shy of his half century when he was caught at extra cover off Kemar Roach after hitting nine fours in his 43-ball knock.

Bell and Taylor put together a 50 partnership in 62 balls to take England to the brink of victory and the latter delivered the coup de grace with a four behind square.

England rested James Anderson and Stuart Broad for their penultimate run-out before they begin their quest for a first World Cup title against co-hosts Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Saturday.

West Indies, who won the first two World Cups in 1975 and 1979, open their campaign against Ireland in Nelson, New Zealand next Monday.

Anyone who has spent time around babies between four and six months of age will know that they develop an absolute fascination with their feet at this point of their lives.

They wave them around, grab them and try stuffing them into their mouths.

However, once these young ones learn how to be mobile, i.e. crawl, stand and walk, this fascination wears away in favour of the more exciting world around, and feet become more of a means to an end.

As adults, the most we probably think about our feet is when we have been abusing them by standing too long or exercising them too much, or considering how they look in footwear.

This lack of attention, and sometimes abuse, notably for the sake of fashion, can result in our feet suffering unnecessarily.

International Medical University podiatrist Stella Chai shares some of common conditions our feet can be afflicted with.

Says Chai: “Diabetic wounds are the top foot problem in Malaysia.”

This is hardly surprising, considering that not only 15.2% or about 2.6 million Malaysian adults are estimated to have diabetes, but also that about half of them are unaware they even have the disease, according to the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2011.

In addition, the Diabcare Malaysia 2013 survey found that three-quarters of diagnosed diabetics do not have their blood sugar levels under control.

This means that they are more liable to develop complications, like loss of sensation in their feet (peripheral neuropathy).

This loss of sensation means that when they step on something sharp or have an irritant in their shoe rubbing against their skin, they actually do not realise that their foot has been injured.

And if they do not make the effort to regularly inspect their feet for such injuries, as is commonly advised by healthcare professionals, then the wound could progress as far as leaking pus and smelling foul before the patient picks up on it.

Diabetics who get injured, also do not heal as fast as healthy people, due to their disease.

Aside from considering how they look in shoes, do you ever think about your feet, especially their health? — AFP

Says Chai, who is part of the diabetes management team at the IMU Bukit Jalil, Selangor, clinic: “Normally, diabetic patients come in with Grade 4 (deep ulcer with abscess or osteomyelitis) or 5 (gangrene of the forefoot) wounds.”

They typically would have been to see several different medical specialists, who would probably have advised them to amputate their feet, or traditional medicine practitioners, or even tried their own home remedies, she adds.

However, Chai says that podiatrists can help patients prevent gangrene and amputation, even when the ulcers or wounds are severe, although she warns that this is a long process, requiring lots of effort and commitment from the patient themselves.

According to her, preventing such wounds from getting bad in the first place boils down to diabetics checking their feet diligently and thoroughly every day, as well as washing, cleaning and drying their feet daily.

“Malaysians like to wash their feet, but they don’t always dry them properly – you need to dry the feet as well,” she notes.

Skin and nail conditions

Such conditions commonly include calluses and corns, ingrown toenails, fungal infections and veruccas.

Chai explains that when shearing forces act on the feet from the action of walking in shoes, it can either result in a blister or a corn.

“When you have a shearing stress on a part of your foot, what happens is, your body, to protect that area from blistering, develops a layer of hard skin. This is actually a callus.

“When that callus builds up because the pressure keeps on coming and nothing is done about it, you’re going to develop a corn,” she says.

While most people can use corn plasters for treatment, Chai strictly advises diabetics against it as the plasters contain a chemical that can cause maceration and ulceration.

“What diabetics can do is actually file the corn down with a sandpaper file, apply moisturiser, and take away the pressure,” she says, adding that oftentimes the pressure is due to the shoe.

Ingrown toenails can be caused by poorly-cut nails or toenails that curl inward.

“Things you can do to prevent it is cut your nails straight across (and) make sure there are no sharp edges.

“And if your toenails are very involuted, what you can do is toe surgery,” she says.

Meanwhile, fungal infections are encouraged by sweaty feet, which in turn, are generally caused by our hot weather and preference for synthetic socks and shoes.

“Hygiene is very important – just drying our feet properly,” says Chai.

Common symptoms include itchiness, small blisters, and peeling and flaky skin.

Another common foot infection results in veruccas or plantar warts. These are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV).

According to Chai, there is no 100% cure for veruccas, only the symptoms can be treated.

“Sometimes, symptoms can take weeks or months to cure. But what you can do is prevent the spread to other parts of the body or to other people, (so) keep it covered,” she says.

Treatment options include freezing and removing it, chemical treatment, and home remedies like applying banana skin and marigold flowers to the verucca.

Biomechanical problems

Chai shares that flat feet are quite common among Asians, probably due to genetic predisposition.

One way to detect if you have flat feet is to wet them, then press them onto a piece of cloth; if the impression is squarish rather than a C-shape, then you have flat feet.

However, she adds: “All children have flat feet. They develop arches later on (around three to four years of age).”

For adults with flat feet that do not cause any problems, nothing needs to be done.

However, for those experiencing discomfort and knee, back or hip pain, Chai says, “You will find that they need to do a biomechanical assessment because flat feet affect the whole body.”

This assessment includes checking muscle strength, body alignment and leg length.

She notes that while the treatment requires patients to wear insoles every time they are on their feet, this rarely happens as patients tend to pick and choose when to use the insoles.

Therefore, they also need to attend physiotherapy to strengthen their muscles and arches to help prevent the pain caused by their flat feet.

In general, Chai advises everyone to check their feet and shoes regularly, moisturise their feet, cut their toenails regularly, and keep any wounds clean and dry.

According to her, most minor foot wounds should heal within three to four days, so if anyone has wounds that do not heal within a week, they should consult a doctor or podiatrist as soon as possible.","Sun, 08 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/newTsol_logo_socmedia.png,"['common', 'chai', 'way', 'prevent', 'flat', 'wounds', 'foot', 'face', 'diabetics', 'develop', 'folks', 'problems', 'walk', 'feet', 'patients', 'toenails']", 
49,49,FL-2015-000010-IDN,Diabetes drug may help obese women conceive and have healthier children - Science AAAS,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/02/diabetes-drug-may-help-obese-women-conceive-and-have-healthier-children,"Many obese women have a hard time getting pregnant. When they do, often with the help of infertility treatments, they tend to have children who are prone to obesity themselves. Now, working in mice, researchers have identified a process in egg cells that may account for both of these problems. What’s more, a new diabetes drug—now in clinical trials—may offer a solution.

This is “a new idea about how obesity affects the quality of eggs,” says David Albertini, a reproductive scientist at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, who was not involved in the study.

Obesity doesn’t just impact a person’s lifestyle—it can also alter the way their cells work. High levels of fats and cholesterols can clog up a cell’s machinery and interfere with its ability to build fully functional proteins. More specifically, obesity stresses the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where proteins are made and shuttled throughout the cell. This process, known as ER stress, can cause the cell to self-destruct and can occur in cells throughout the body, including the liver, pancreas, and brain.

To find out if this stress response takes place inside egg cells as well, researchers led by Rebecca Robker, a cell biologist at the University of Adelaide in Australia, turned to a mouse model of obesity that closely replicates what’s seen in humans. The aptly named Blobby mice have a genetic mutation that causes them to overeat their way to obesity on regular, low-fat mouse chow.

The researchers monitored both ER stress and the activity of mitochondria, the energy-generating machinery of cells, in the egg cells of obese and healthy mice, as well as how their egg cells faired after in vitro fertilization (IVF). When the researchers compared the patterns of gene expression in the egg cells of obese and lean mice, they found that the Blobby mice had significantly higher levels of genetic markers for ER stress. Critically, Blobby eggs also had reduced mitochondrial activity compared with their lean litter mates’ egg cells.

“When we saw that the mitochondria in the eggs were damaged, we knew that that was a very important and critical problem,” Robker says. Mitochondria in eggs are particularly important; although both parents contribute DNA to a child, mitochondria from the mother’s eggs give rise to all the mitochondria in every single cell of an offspring’s body.

The researchers found that the damaged mitochondria in the eggs of obese mice couldn’t replicate properly in the embryos. The fetuses that developed from the eggs of Blobby mice were heavier than those from skinny mice, and they had less mitochondrial DNA in their livers, kidneys, and hearts.

“This is important because it provides a new mechanism, a new understanding, for how obesity may lead to an offspring’s own propensity for obesity,” Robker says.

She and her colleagues predicted that both the cellular stress response and the mitochondrial damage could be reversed by treating obese mice with existing compounds. A stressed ER can flood a cell with calcium, and mitochondria, which help keep calcium levels in check inside cells, can then become overwhelmed and break down. Robker’s team reasoned that by tackling the problem in the ER, the benefits would trickle down to the mitochondria. Indeed, when the researchers gave the obese mice BGP-15—an ER stress inhibitor that in early clinical trials for diabetes research is already proving to be a safe and effective way to increase mitochondria in muscle cells—the eggs showed both lower levels of cellular stress and higher mitochondrial activity. And when these eggs were fertilized and transferred into surrogate mothers, they no longer grew into overweight fetuses, the team reports online today in Development.

Robker’s team is now testing whether the diabetes drug will have similar fertility-boosting effects on isolated human eggs. Still, she notes that weight loss and nutritional strategies—instead of drugs—can also keep women from having to resort to IVF. “Obese women only have to lose a small amount of weight and their natural fertility will often return.”","Tue, 10 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/sn-fertilityH_0.jpg?itok=u7xtJEWp,"['help', 'mice', 'eggs', 'stress', 'drug', 'obese', 'healthier', 'diabetes', 'researchers', 'egg', 'obesity', 'mitochondria', 'conceive', 'women', 'cells', 'er', 'children']", 
50,50,FL-2015-000010-IDN,The big draw - Port Strategy,https://www.portstrategy.com/news101/port-operations/planning-and-design/backup-power-and-automation-the-big-draw,"Automation poses some tough power supply-related questions for ports, explains Stevie Knight

Automated terminals are more efficient in their use of power but they also pull hard on the electrical infrastructure, so what happens if there’s a power cut?

In most cases the subject of automation only comes up when a terminal is well established and has a firm footing in its power supply but this still means a large power step change as the old diesel yard equipment get replaced by swanky new, grid-powered systems. Peter Mallin of Mott MacDonald points out that while there’s no doubt automated equipment is more efficient than diesel, it puts much more demand on the power supply.

To give an idea of the scale of the electrical demand, traditional ports’ quay cranes are king of the power draw, often with peak demands of around 2,000 kVA he explains. While a typical automated stacking crane (ASC) may only peak at around 50% to 60% of that when running and hoisting, an automated terminal could easily be looking at upwards of two or three dozen of them depending on terminal size and throughput profile.

On the flipside, there are some areas of savings: “Automated and unmanned ARMGs and ASCs can operate in darkness so no flood lights in the yard are needed...a significant consumer,” says Fredrik Johanson of ABB. Further, much automated equipment recycles the energy from lowering actions of both container cranes and handling equipment – ABB’s ASC’s regenerate around 70% of their consumption.

Stepping up

However, there’s still a potentially large step up in power demand between non-automated and fully automated terminals. Mr Mallin’s colleague Alex To says while it is difficult to pin down how much of a step this presents as it depends on the existing equipment, based on experience, he estimates an approximate 25% rise when switching from electric RTGs to ASC operation on a like-for-like basis. Given that many will be launching themselves from diesel equipment, an equivalent facility could potentially be faced with an even higher power jump.

So installing backup power can get pricey and as it will certainly require at least several megawatts per berth, Mr Mallin points out that it “represents a significant investment”.

Kevin McKinney of MTU Onsite Energy says that a fairly modest 10MW backup system, for example, can be made by paralleling three or four large generators but the total cost for them alone (not including the installation) comes to $4m or $5m.

Of course, to get the most out of automated terminals, you want clever energy management and this is where the sums get complex: many quay cranes have a power-sharing system between ‘paralleled’ units, but some of the big cranes, along with automated handling equipment such as ABB’s ASCs, are taking this one stage further and have developed an energy efficient system that puts what’s left over back into the grid – remember that 70% figure? Of course, most of it will probably be taken up by the other, paralleled equipment but it’s variable. So what happens to the extra energy when the systems are off the grid?

Generated energy



The fact is it has to be treated fairly carefully. Mr McKinney says that the gensets cannot absorb regenerated energy from the equipment: “You can’t push power back into the generators,” he explains. So for safety’s sake a terminal may well need to include a load bank where resistors can safely take off the surplus. It may not affect the general overall picture that much, but the calculations do have to take the potential peaks in demand with both generators and safety systems sized accordingly.

Further, it can be quite a challenge to find the space in the heart of a port: “Terminal’s can be quite congested areas, so if within the terminal, the area for backup generation has to be balanced with what amount of revenue per hectare might be lost,” explains Mr Mallin. Mr McKinney adds that going back to a 10MW system, you’d need something like a 420m2 area, and though lower, sub-600V systems require the generators set quite close to the consumers; if the port can deploy medium or high voltage lines the power generation area can then be set some way away from the site.

One important point is while these backup gensets might not be run that often, the fuel for them can’t just be left to sit: fuel, especially biodiesels containing FAME derivatives, can degrade pretty badly especially in a damp port environment. So, you do have to keep rotating what is in the tanks, he says, as the last thing you’d want is an expensive backup power system failing in a crisis.

While most big ports are situated in a fairly well developed areas, some high volume facilities may find themselves in places that lack a completely guaranteed, 24/7, 365-days-a-year electrical supply. Mr McKinney says: “Even if the power outages only happen three or four times a year, there may be good reason to put in enough power generation to cover most of the operations... it all depends how sensitive the port is to stopping work.”

In fact, Tim Vancampen of ICTSI says that there are questions about how to tailor the backup investment: a power cut to the big quay cranes can mean stranding personnel up in the air or even leaving loads – of maybe 90 tonnes – swinging uncontrollably. Again, it’s a matter of choices: “Even a small power plant is expensive and if you have eight quay cranes, a port might consider putting in a supply that would run full power to just a few of them.”

Future proofing



There’s also accommodating the power layout. “A lot of people are learning as automation evolves,” says Mr Mallin. The problem is, ports are having to plan into the future now.

Mr To explains: “Ports tend to phase in the automation, moving from one set of equipment to another but each stage can build up issues for the next. For example, a port might be looking at automated straddle carriers to replace manual straddle carriers at some point in the future, but automated straddle carriers tend to operate in the backreach of the quay crane, not underneath, so this has a knock on effect on the area used for the apron.”

He adds that this can have an impact long in advance as associated services like ducting and sensors are buried beneath the surface over quite a large area: “For one project we are already talking about pushing all the ASC stacks landward even though plans for automated straddle carriers are just at the concept stage.”

“It’s a challenge,” he says. “You have a finite space and lots of implications, if you get it wrong now, then stepping toward full automation could be a problem.”","Tue, 10 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.portstrategy.com/__data/assets/file/0034/768049/portstrategy.ico,"['equipment', 'power', 'backup', 'energy', 'automated', 'cranes', 'system', 'strategy', 'mr', 'terminal', 'port']", 
51,51,FL-2015-000010-IDN,"In Nottingham, one woman is fighting food poverty with 'social eating' - The Guardian",https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/feb/17/nottingham-fighting-food-poverty-social-eating,"“I’d call myself a ‘social eating advocate’... or maybe a ‘food crisis responder’,” says Marsha Smith as we sit down for lunch at her home on the outskirts of Nottingham. “The fact is, some people just want someone to cook them dinner, and there’s no harm in that.” I heartily agreed as I tucked into the homemade vegetarian and wheat-free meal she’d just placed in front of me.



Almost every item of food on my plate had come via FareShare, an organisation that relieves supermarkets of surplus food (food that’s in date and good to eat, but won’t be sold due to reasons like over-ordering or incorrect labelling) and redistributes it to charities and community projects around the UK. Marsha’s Super Kitchen is one of its 1,700 recipients. At eight locations across Nottinghamshire, this “social eating service” offers a home-cooked meal made from surplus and locally grown ingredients, to be eaten “like a family” for just £2-3 per head.

Once home to a thriving textiles industry, Nottingham now has the highest number of workless households in the country, with 30.1% out of work and 32% of children living in poverty. After brutal cuts to the council – including the scrapping of the local welfare fund – a food bank shut in protest late last year, but the demand remains high with over 20 still serving the area. However, with an estimated 400,000 tonnes of surplus supermarket food available in the UK each year, Marsha wants to shift the focus from food poverty into abundance.

“We need a better mechanism for distributing all this food”, she explains. “Food banks are good in the sense that they meet a need … but they create a cycle of dependency that doesn’t empower anyone. What we’ve shown is that we can get it into communities and onto plates.” She believes that many organisations providing food to those in need ignore the potential paying customers who will financially “buoy up” projects that are feeding those who are economically vulnerable. By avoiding council-allocated funding, she makes her business resilient to funding changes and impacts of local politics, while offering a service that is inclusive and open to anyone.

Since April last year, Super Kitchens across Nottinghamshire have dished out 18,500 meals and have saved over six tonnes of perfectly edible food from landfill. Marsha is also busy working with other local food groups – growers, “cook and eat” organisations and school allotment projects – to “unite them under a resilient brand”. This interconnectivity between projects demonstrates the importance of a networked approach in combating issues such as food insecurity (the experience of not knowing where the next meal will come from) in the city.

Aside from the health and environmental benefits of eating nutritious meals made from otherwise tip-bound food, it’s the social element of Super Kitchens that Marsha is most excited about, and what she has tapped into is nothing new. In fact, the word “companion” comes from the latin com (together) and panis (bread), and literally translates to “bread fellow”. “In a time when our need to eat and be sociable has been privatised, we need more spaces to get together in,” Marsha says, and that’s what her social eating service achieves by creating new public space in the city around food.

“You know that whenever you drop in for a meal, there’ll be someone to talk to who’s there for the same reasons,” Marsha explains. She tells me about the single parents who visit the kitchen weekly to give themselves a night off, or the elderly woman who found comfort in eating a home cooked meal after her husband passed away. The communal environment of a Super Kitchen seems akin to the kind of congenial and supportive feel of the working men’s clubs that were at the heart of tight-knit communities for so many years.

With Super Kitchen’s first birthday around the corner, Marsha is busy working on a strategy to persuade supermarkets to pay for public cafes where they can serve up their surplus food to a customer base who want to connect with it for social and environmental good. “There will always be surplus food in circulation,” she explains; “it’s a shameful outcome of our industrialised food system”. What she is trying to create is a platform upon which supermarkets can showcase their surplus produce, rather than trading it off in secret, without the fear of being exposed for rejecting perfectly edible produce.

Through stitching together a networks of food growers, educators, community organisations, distributors and suppliers in Nottingham, Marsha is creating the conditions through which urban resilience can grow. By providing spaces for individuals from different backgrounds to meet – and eat – the fabric of a robust and adaptable society can be woven from the ground up.

“Without social spaces for people, the atomisation and fragmentation of society builds,” Marsha warns me as she spoons a final helping onto my plate. For her, the recipe for resilience is simple: “We can all start a revolution around the dinner table.”","Tue, 17 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/13/1423840926872/71c4fee0-7131-4a7f-81a0-91fa89b49ed5-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c7ad9f4a6b025267b7d1505512f6027e,"['need', 'super', 'nottingham', 'poverty', 'marsha', 'spaces', 'kitchen', 'fighting', 'social', 'surplus', 'food', 'eating', 'woman', 'meal']",

53,53,FL-2015-000010-IDN,A Whitewash of Biblical Proportions - The Boar,https://theboar.org/2015/02/whitewash-biblical-proportions/,"2014 was reportedly christened by some to be the ‘year of the Bible movie’ and with good reason: a number of Christian-themed blockbusters were released during last year, from the Son of God that debuted in late February, Darren Aronofsky’s Noah, God’s Not Dead, Heaven is for Real, concluding with Ridley Scott’s retelling of the story of Moses, Exodus: Gods and Kings, released on Boxing Day. It would seem that this re-emergence of the Christian faith-based films will be a genre to carry on this year, with Mary, Mother of Christ portrayed by Odeya Rush, set to come out in Easter 2015; a Hollywood blockbuster that will depict the life of Jesus, Mary and Joseph under the reign of Herod the Great. Also in the works are plans for Will Smith to direct Redemption of Cain, based on the story of Cain and Abel, Pontius Pilate with Brad Pitt, and Resurrection, where a Roman soldier is sent to investigate Christ’s death.

This re-emergence of the Bible epic genre has begun elbowing through the Marvel and DC superheroes, zombie apocalypses and the tired continuation of robot franchises that have dominated the box office. Regarding Hollywood as being primarily a business, the roughly 91 million evangelical Christians in America serve as a strong foundation for huge profits. Placing their faith on the rediscovery of the Bible as a marketable subject would be savy, considering the success of the TV mini-series The Bible that averaged 11.4 million viewers and became the most watched cable show in America in 2013 and spurred the making of the film Son of God. As the figures indicate, there is a large market for those interested in the depictions of Biblical stories. Noah was as well a box-office success, making $359m in its re-telling of the building of his arc before the flood. Not only this, the source material of the best-selling book of all time cannot be underestimated; the abundance of stories makes way for many interpretive depictions, from the more apocalyptic and epic tales that Hollywood thrives off to the more humble and personal.

Noah, starring Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and Anthony Hopkins, pandered to the idea of making something grand and visually stunning through the apocalyptic tale. Its tagline fits this perfectly: ‘the end of the world…is just the beginning.’ The film was a success, grossing over $43.7m over its opening box office weekend and became Aronofsky’s highest opening weekend and first film to open at No. 1. Interestingly Aronofsky described Noah as ‘the least biblical film ever made’ and saw the protagonist, Noah, as the ‘first environmentalist’. The artistic license to withdraw from the more religious elements of the film, such as omitting the word ‘God’ from the film, resulted in a backlash and questions as to why Aronovsky chose to direct a Biblical narrative in the first place.

In an interview with The Independent, he described that his retelling of the Old Testament tale was to ‘bring an original take on this content and bring it out to the world’, noting that the story of Noah is ‘pretty odd’ and ‘strange for people’. The controversy originated from early screenings where Paramount executives took an unfinished cut to Christian groups, concerned over bad publicity. Reports were mixed, some taking issue with Crowe’s portrayal of Noah in a drunken stupor, despite this occurring in the Bible, and the studio tried half a dozen cuts in order to achieve some success through the difficult formula to both allow for some artistic licensing while at the same time placating the religious groups that the film were designed to attract. The film was banned in several countries, the official explanation from Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia that it contradicts teachings of the Koran. For Aronofsky, his expansion and free interpretation of Noah’s story only consisting of a few pages in Genesis were from his own personal interest, and his aim was to challenge the received perceptions of the story, to ‘understand what the story means for the present day’. Recognizing the ecological parallels to global warming, and the protagonist as a hero, these themes were to bring some modernity and relevance to the Biblical epic in the Hollywood package of visual effects, bound to annoy some in the wake of the re-emergence of the biblical genre.

“I can’t mount a film of this budget, where I have to rely on tax rebates in Spain, and say that my lead actor is Mohammad so-and-so from such-and-such” – Ridley Scott

Another Biblical-inspired blockbuster to come under criticism, not just for its content but also its casting, was Ridley Scott’s Exodus: Gods and Kings, starring Christian Bale, Aaron Paul, Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley, which retells the exodus of the Hebrews, led by Moses, from Egypt. The response was lukewarm, with mixed-to-negative reviews from critics on its pacing, screen-writing, and character development, overall unable to live up to the source material. Controversy ensued over statements made by Ridley Scott that he would look towards natural causes for the miracles of the parting of the Red Sea, and Christian Bale’ description of his portrayal of Moses as ‘schizophrenic’ and ‘barbaric’, resulting in concerns that the film would not be biblically accurate. Egypt banned the film due to the historical inaccuracies, followed by Morocco, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait. In an interview Ridley Scott confirmed that Exodus was his biggest project to date but that rather than approaching it as his biggest he came to it ‘it from the point of view of the characters, of the story.’ Regardless, his emphasis was on the scale of the movie, and the extraordinary effects that allow for what occurs on screen to look real, concluding that this was going to be ‘fucking huge’ in its scope.

The major controversy over Exodus centred around the accusation of whitewashing, where the principal cast was comprised almost exclusively of white actors, getting round the issue of darkening the actor’s skin by use of fake tan. In an interview with Variety over the decision, Scott made it clear that he hadn’t even considered casting non-white actors, arguing that ‘I can’t mount a film of this budget, where I have to rely on tax rebates in Spain, and say that my lead actor is Mohammad so-and-so from such-and-such. I’m just not going to get it financed. So the question doesn’t even come up’.

The unapologetic and tactless response brought home the reality for non-white actors in the Hollywood film industry, where the stand-alone Biblical drama could not afford to cast newcomers or lesser-known actors. However, the issue of financial backing does not absolve Scott of such responsibility and the response to not have even considered casting ‘Mohammed so-and-so’, apparently his term for all non-white actors, would suggest that the issue partly lies with directors refusing to offer the chance to those who would be a fairer representation of the characters. At the film’s New York premiere, the director told critics to ‘get a life’ in the wake of his decision to cast white actors in Middle Eastern roles. Christian Bale, in response to the accusations of the whitewashed epic, stated that audience habits would need to change if actors of Middle Eastern or North African heritage can be given a chance in similarly pitched Hollywood productions.

Yannis Behrakis: At the end of the first Iraq war about 1.5 million Kurds were fleeing in panic trying to escape from forces loyal to Saddam Hussein. About 600,000 of them fled to Turkey but half of them were stranded in the mountains at the Iraqi-Turkish border.

I hitch-hiked a ride on a tractor pulling a cart full of bread to feed the stranded Kurdish refugees atop the snow capped mountains at the border.

As the tractor made its way slowly through the dangerous dirt road, it was attacked by hundreds of hungry refugees who fought against each other and the aid workers. The men I was riding with tried in vain to stop the refugees from taking the bread but the refugees were absolutely desperate and the aid workers gave up.

Getting up the mountain to cover the story was extremely difficult. I remember leaving the hotel every morning at 4 am in order to reach the bottom of the mountain two-and-a-half hours later. Then I hitchhiked my way on either a tractor carrying bread or on a snow-removal vehicle clearing the road. Once, my hands were so cold they stuck to the snow-removing vehicle.

56,56,FL-2015-000010-IDN,Desegregating blood: A civil rights struggle to remember - The Conversation US,https://theconversation.com/desegregating-blood-a-civil-rights-struggle-to-remember-37480,"In December 1941, a few days after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the U.S. entry into World War II, a Detroit mother named Sylvia Tucker visited her local Red Cross donor center to give blood.

Having heard the “soul-stirring” appeals for blood donors on her radio, she was determined to do her part. But when she arrived at the center, the supervisor turned her away. “Orders from the National Offices,” he explained, “barred Negro blood donors at this time.”

“Shocked” and “grieved,” Tucker left in tears, later penning a letter of protest about the whole ordeal to first lady Eleanor Roosevelt.

Today, this discriminatory blood program and African-Americans’ determined opposition to it are long forgotten, despite the fact that a few scholars, including Spencie Love, Susan E. Lederer, Sarah E. Chinn, and myself, have explored the topic.

This history is worth remembering. It provides an antidote to facile, feel-good stories about the “Good War,” stories that scholars such as Michael C.C. Adams and Kenneth D. Rose have long refuted but that live on in museum exhibits, blockbuster films, best-selling books and war memorials.

The story of how blood got desegregated also reminds Americans that, as novelist Ralph Ellison wrote nearly a half-century ago, “The black American … puts pressure upon the nation to live up to its ideals.”

Historian Robin D.G. Kelley puts it more broadly: “The marginal and excluded have done the most to make democracy work in America.”

In an age of resurgent racism, Ellison’s and Kelley’s words are especially important and timely.

‘A tremendous thing’

The Red Cross Blood Donor Program began in early 1941 – and went on to collect blood from millions of Americans that the military shipped to soldiers fighting overseas.

“If I could reach all America,” asserted General Dwight D. Eisenhower at the end of the war, “there is one thing I would like to do – thank them for blood plasma and whole blood. It has been a tremendous thing.”

Tremendous indeed: The blood program saved many lives. But it also initially excluded African-American donors like Sylvia Tucker. When it did accept them, in January 1942, it did so on a segregated basis.

Never mind that scientists saw no relationship between race and blood and that one of the world’s leading authorities on blood banking at the time, and the director of the Red Cross’s pilot blood program, was an African-American scientist named Dr. Charles Drew. Never mind that Nazi Germany had its own Aryan-only blood policy or that America’s principal rhetorical war aims concerned democracy and freedom.

To what extent military commanders segregated blood in the field was, during the war and afterwards, a matter of some debate. Officially, at least, the distinction between bloods remained in place for years. It was not until 1950 that the Red Cross stopped requiring the segregation of so-called Negro blood. And it was not until the late 1960s and early 1970s that Southern states such as Arkansas and Louisiana overturned similar requirements.

A forgotten civil rights struggle

In one internal memorandum, the Red Cross called its donor program democratic, since “the point of view of the majority … ” – which its leaders assumed demanded blood segregation – “must be taken into account in a democracy.”

But many blacks and their allies had a very different idea about democracy, one that required all citizens be treated equally and without regard to race. They fought tirelessly throughout the war years to make that idea a reality, not simply in the military, in the workplace and in Hollywood films but also in the blood program.

These many battles constituted a nascent, surging, and, today, too-often-overlooked civil rights struggle that helped pave the way for the more famous movement of the postwar years.

Nearly all the major civil rights organizations of the day, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the March on Washington Movement and even the upstart Committee (later, Congress) of Racial Equality, made changing blood policy a top priority. One statement from a group of the nation’s most prominent black leaders put it this way:

“In justice to what we know to be the practically unanimous sentiment among Negroes in America, we affirm the need for alteration of the segregated blood plasma policy.”

Black newspapers, enormously popular and important at time, also protested blood segregation and exclusion, regularly featuring front-page stories, boldface headlines and blistering editorials on the subject.

In January 1942, for example, the African-American weekly the Cleveland Call and Post published an “editorial in rhyme”:

“The cross of Red, that burned so bright

In fire, storm and flood

Is now the crooked Nazi sign

That spurns a Negro blood!”

Wide-ranging activists

Activism on this issue extended well beyond these traditional places.

Labor unions, Christian and Jewish groups, local interracial committees, scientific organizations and the New Jersey State Legislature all spoke out against blood segregation.

The Communist Party of Cuyahoga County in Ohio held a rally of 3,500 people, condemning blood policy as “Barbarian Hitlerism.”

An interracial group of precocious junior high schoolers at Harlem’s Public School 43 tested (with the help of their science teachers) the blood of a black student and of a white student. Finding no difference, they wrote an article in the school paper, made and distributed hundreds of posters, and held a public meeting – all in opposition to the Red Cross policy.

The most widespread form of protest, however, came from thousands of ordinary African-Americans who refused to donate blood and money to the Red Cross.

While roughly 10 percent of the U.S. population at the time, blacks made up less than 1 percent of all blood donors.

African-Americans contributed generously to the Treasury Department’s Defense Bonds: It is not a lack of patriotism that explains their halfhearted response to blood drives. The reason was a determined opposition to race-based exclusion and segregation.

Expressing these feelings best was a high school student from Cleveland named Geraldyne Ghess. Her poem appeared in the local black newspaper:

Had I wealth, I’d burn it all;

Not one cent for the Red Cross call.

Our money is good … our blood is bad.

But, still that shouldn’t make us mad.

Are they afraid they’ll all turn black?

Is that why our blood they lack?

Their skins are white as snow … it’s well.

Their souls are tarnished, black as hell.

In the end, this wide-ranging activism may have failed to democratize the blood program fully – at least during the war.

But African-Americans did – in the end – force the Red Cross to include them as donors.

Full-fledged integration, which took a few more years, owed everything to their work.

Yet in some cases it is nearly impossible to establish with certainty the source of money behind shell companies. Purchasers can register shell companies in the names of accountants, lawyers or relatives. Purchases are often made not just by individuals but on behalf of groups of investors or numerous family members, further obscuring the origin of the funds. What is more, ownership of shell companies can be shifted at any time, with no indication in property records.

The high-end real estate market has become less and less transparent — and more alluring for those abroad with assets they wish to keep anonymous — even as the United States pushes other nations to help stanch the flow of American money leaving the country to avoid taxes. Yet for all the concerns of law enforcement officials that shell companies can hide illicit gains, regulatory efforts to require more openness from these companies have failed.

“We like the money,” said Raymond Baker, the president of Global Financial Integrity, a Washington nonprofit that tracks the illicit flow of money. “It’s that simple. We like the money that comes into our accounts, and we are not nearly as judgmental about it as we should be.”

In some ways, officials are clamoring for the foreign wealthy. In New York, tax breaks for condominium developments benefit owners looking for a second, or third, residence in one of Manhattan’s premier buildings. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said on his weekly radio program in 2013, shortly before leaving office: “If we could get every billionaire around the world to move here, it would be a godsend.”

Among the Time Warner Center owners identified by The Times are at least 17 billionaires on Forbes magazine’s annual list of the world’s richest people. Five of the world’s leading art collectors own units, as do eight people who have been chief executives of major companies. And it has been home to numerous celebrities, including the singers Jimmy Buffett and Ricky Martin, the New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and the talk show host Kelly Ripa.

A look behind some doors revealed more complicated tales.

Units 72B and 51E are owned by the Amantea Corporation, which The Times traced to a mining magnate named Anil Agarwal. His company was fined for polluting a major river near a copper mine in Zambia, which sickened nearby residents. And judicial committees in his native India determined that his company had violated the land rights of an indigenous tribe near a proposed mine.","Sun, 08 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/16/us/xxOVERVIEWSUB01/xxOVERVIEWSUB01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=dca2a41764d32d3ecdaf5db28245fdce1cddd922436893680953defa11725ca3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"['stream', 'ownership', 'shell', 'wealth', 'foreign', 'company', 'flows', 'warner', 'money', 'worlds', 'records', 'york', 'estate', 'times', 'real', 'companies', 'elite', 'relatives']",

Lights and sound were being tested and a swarm of people in brightly coloured workout wear was waiting with bated breath for Alberto ‘Beto’ Perez, the man behind the massively popular Zumba Fitness movement, to take the stage.At 7:30 pm, Pérez made his entry and sent the crowd into raptures. For the next 90 minutes, the 45-year old from Cali, Colombia, a town infamous for its connections to cocaine cartels, had people on a different high. He led the throng of some 1,200 people through a master class (costing Rs 1,000 each).Pérez has taken the long route to stardom. His fascination began when he saw Grease, the movie which starred John Travolta, clad in leather and with slicked back hair. The young Pérez was hooked, slicking his hair back similarly, buying an imitation jacket and sowing the seeds of a life-long fascination with dance, music and movement.Ironically, childhood was a difficult time for Pérez. “I was a nerd, a bookworm who spent countless hours reading books on religion, history and social sciences,” says Pérez a day before his big performance. “My stepfather was very strict and perhaps this made me such an introvert.”In sharp contrast to his earlier introverted ways, Pérez today is all beans. When he enters Starbucks at the Taj Mahal Hotel in south Mumbai, heads turn. He’s in a sleeveless bright blue vest, with Zumba emblazoned across the front, and baggy trackpants. “I always knew I wanted to do something around dance and fitness,” he says. “I didn’t expect my business to however become such a global phenomenon.”Physically, Pérez looks like someone who lives to exercise — he is all toned muscle and tanned skin. He walks with a measured gait, almost cat-like on his feet and his energy shows in the way he talks about his business. He speaks in emotional bursts, occasionally turning to his colleagues to translate some Spanish (his English is not yet quite there yet) to convey a thought.Pérez is the creative brain of the enterprise, constantly devising new steps and movements and thinking of new ways to keep people working out. There’s an almost cultish reverence to the programme. At his master class in Mumbai, attendees (a majority of them women) jostle with each other to get to the front rows.Pérez started by badgering health clubs in his native Cali to let him take aerobics classes (he studied in the evenings) as a teenager. He even won a local dance competition and another in the capital Bogota, buying an apartment of his own and becoming a bit of a local celebrity. However, Pérez was ambitious and wanted much more. This drove him to risk it all and move to the US, to Florida, to try his luck in a bigger market. Here, he discovered he was a nobody. “No one wanted to give me a chance… we went to many clubs and asked for just a trial,” he reminisces. “No one would let a stranger, without all the folders full of certificates, be an instructor.” He finally managed to snag a gig at a small club to teach aerobics. Forgetting his regular music set turned out to accidentally be the spark that ignited his creative skills, and in turn, a new wave of fitness.Faced with having to teach an aerobics class with a random set of dance music, he improvised a series of dance and exercise steps, which caught on. “The first time, barely three or four people turned up for my class of 15 minutes,” Pérez says. “But in months, I was doing 45-minute sessions for groups of 50-55.” His growing popularity allowed him to lay a foundation for himself, buy a car to get around (a $400 Pontiac 85, a clunker with no air-conditioning to beat Florida’s stifling heat), to get to more classes and grow his business.Among those he impressed as a novice in Colombia was a Mrs Perlman, the mother of Alberto Perlman, a businessman who cashed out in the dotcom boom and was looking for his next big idea. The two met with a third Alberto, a school friend named Alberto Aghion, to refine this business idea.The three Albertos didn’t know it back then (over a decade ago) that their fitness movement, which they called Zumba would become a smash hit (Pérez says they stated with Rumba-exercise and went through heaps of gibberish before settling on this name).Today, Zumba (the company is called Zumba Fitness) is a fitness regime that uses various types of music (ranging from salsa and merengue initially to even Bollywood today) and pieces together a freeflowing energetic workout.“Fitness can be fun,” says Pérez. “People want their workout to be a social occasion.” The crowd in Mumbai seem to have had a whale of a time. Pérez had attendees in a thrall with a series of moves, mostly performed in trackpants and wearing a cap, with his ripped abs on show. “The energy at the show was almost unreal,” one woman attendee, a newcomer to Zumba, told this writer after the event. “I can’t wait for my next class.”The numbers tell their own story. The number of Zumba classes globally have grown from 4.4 lakh per week in 2012 to 5.6 lakh in 2014. Zumba classes and trainers are available in 186 countries today, compared to 180 in 2013 and 160 in 2012. And, the number of people taking these classes has grown from 120 lakh every week in 2012 to 150 lakh now.In 2012, two investors, Raine Group and Insight Venture Partners, took a minority stake in the company. This round of investment valued the firm at $500 million, according to some estimates.“Zumba is incredibly accessible,” says John Salter, partner at Raine Group. “The brand is one of only a few globally recognised fitness brands.”As millions have flocked to these Zumba classes, the business model too has evolved. While Pérez used to be the only one who knew the ingredients of the secret sauce, he has now spread the word.In India, for example, there are 2,000 licensed Zumba instructors (around half are active) and classes can be taken at a gym, club, studio, home or even under a tree. “They just need space to work out and have fun,” Pérez says.Emerging markets may be the next big place for Zumba. Gyms in India have mushroomed, but few of them are profitable, saddled with high rentals, truant members and rising capital expenditure. Zumba gives these gyms the opportunity to use some of the dead time (when a gym is empty or barely used) to train instructors and hold classes. “Our members today demand that we have a Zumba class on our premises,” says G Ramachandran, who helms the Gold’s Gym franchise in India.Keeping this momentum going won’t be easy. Zumba isn’t the first white-hot fitness trend to excite consumers with its promise of delivering a sculpted figure to its participants.From the ’80s onwards, products such as Shake Weights, Sauna Suits, 8-Minute Abs, Exercise in a Bottle, Power Balance bracelets, ThighMaster and even Dumbbell Utensils, have all promised the moon to its users. Most, if not all of them, proved to be momentary fads.Pérez wants to stand clear of this graveyard of fitness products. He is unequivocal that money can’t buy you fitness. “You have to enjoy what you’re doing, you have to have fun,” he says. “We don’t have any special equipment or fancy gadgets.”To become a Zumba trainer, you need to sign up with the firm and fork out a fee for a two-day programme (and more for instructional videos which are constantly updated), before you can take a class.More recently, Pérez and Co have looked for new businesses opportunities — by devising new forms of the workout for juniors and seniors, extending the brand into apparel and accessories and even a hit video game — to boost sales. According to some estimates, the new brand extensions account for half of Zumba’s revenues.Over the past decade, Pérez and his associates have saturated the developed markets with a flood of instructors and classes and then turned their attention to emerging markets such as India. In the past 24 months, he has not just rocked an event in Mumbai, but been to Indonesia, Brazil and China too, trying to proselytise Zumba. To try to keep the energy growing and sustain the fanatical interest around Zumba, he points to subtle shifts in the way people work out.“People are considering options beyond the gym,” says Pérez. “They may opt for a combination of Zumba, Pilates and Yoga. Zumba is not a fitness programme, it is a lifestyle.”Thirty three-year old Sucheta Pal, an engineer by training, is one of the believers. Until 2009, she was working in the IT industry in the US, but a meeting with Pérez had her hooked. Not only did she give up her corporate career, she became a trainer and returned to India as the master trainer for India.In two years she has led the training of some 2,000 trainers in India and thinks she can double that count in the next 12 months. “The event in Mumbai is proof that the buzz around Zumba is growing,” says Pal. “The uniqueness around Zumba is that anyone can do it and it can be taught anywhere.”Zumba’s investors say emerging markets are vital to Zumba’s success. “International expansion is a high priority and (we are confident) the Indian market will embrace Zumba and the values that the brand represents,” says Salter of Raine Group.Pérez may be the co-founder of a booming fitness business, but he’s happiest when he’s back in Miami in his workout gear. When’s he is town, around 90-100 people land up thrice a week at his studio eagerly awaiting their workout. This is when Pérez truly feels at home.","Sun, 08 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-46157567,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-99385,overlay-etpanache/photo.jpg","['wants', 'india', 'dance', 'class', 'beto', 'drudgery', 'pérez', 'perezs', 'business', 'classes', 'workout', 'mumbai', 'fitness', 'working', 'zumba']",

A huge population of people in the Bay of Bengal could be forced to find a new home

BALI ISLAND, India -- The tiny hut sculpted out of mud at the edge of the sea is barely large enough for Bokul Mondol and his family to lie down. The water has taken everything else from them, and one day it almost certainly will take this, too.

Saltwater long ago engulfed the 5 acres where Mondol once grew rice and tended fish ponds, as his ancestors had on Bali Island for some 200 years. His thatch-covered hut, built on public land, is the fifth he has had to build in the last five years as the sea creeps in.

""Every year we have to move a little further inland,"" he said.

Seas are rising more than twice as fast as the global average here in the Sundarbans, a low-lying delta region of about 200 islands in the Bay of Bengal where some 13 million impoverished Indians and Bangladeshis live. Tens of thousands like Mondol have already been left homeless, and scientists predict much of the Sundarbans could be underwater in 15 to 25 years.

That could force a singularly massive exodus of millions of ""climate refugees,"" creating enormous challenges for India and Bangladesh that neither country has prepared for.

""This big-time climate migration is looming on the horizon,"" said Tapas Paul, a New Delhi-based environmental specialist with the World Bank, which is spending hundreds of millions of dollars assessing and preparing a plan for the Sundarbans region.

""If all the people of the Sundarbans have to migrate, this would be the largest-ever migration in the history of mankind,"" Paul said. The largest to date occurred during the India-Pakistan partition in 1947, when 10 million people or more migrated from one country to the other.

A woman spreads boiled paddy to dry outside her house at Dulki village in the Sundarbans, India, Jan. 31, 2015. AP

Mondol has no idea where he would go. His family of six is now entirely dependent on neighbors who have not lost their land. Some days they simply don't eat.

""For 10 years I was fighting with the sea, until finally everything was gone,"" he says, staring blankly at the water lapping at the muddy coast. ""We live in constant fear of flooding. If the island is lost, we will all die.""

On their own, the Sundarbans' impoverished residents have little chance of moving before catastrophe hits. Facing constant threats from roving tigers and crocodiles, deadly swarms of giant honeybees and poisonous snakes, they struggle to eke out a living by farming, shrimping, fishing and collecting honey from the forests.

Each year, with crude tools and bare hands, they build mud embankments to keep saltwater and wild animals from invading their crops. And each year swollen rivers, monsoon rains and floods wash many of those banks and mud-packed homes back into the sea.

Most struggle on far less than $1 a day. With 5 million people on the Indian side and 8 million in Bangladesh, the Sundarbans population is far greater than any of the small island nations that also face dire threats from rising sea levels.

Losing the 10,000-square-mile region -- an area about the size of Haiti - would also take an environmental toll. The Sundarbans region is teeming with wildlife, including the world's only population of mangrove forest tigers. The freshwater swamps and their tangles of mangrove forests act as a natural buffer protecting India's West Bengal state and Bangladesh from cyclones.

With rising temperatures melting polar ice and expanding oceans, seas have been rising globally at an average rate of about 3 millimeters a year -- a rate scientists say is likely to speed up. The latest projections suggest seas could rise on average up to about 3.3 feet this century.

That would be bad enough for the Sundarbans, where the highest point is around 9.8 feet and the mean elevation is less than a meter above sea level. But sea rise occurs unevenly across the globe because of factors like wind, ocean currents, tectonic shift and variations in the Earth's gravitational pull. The rate of sea rise in the Sundarbans has been measured at twice the global rate or even higher.

In addition, dams and irrigation systems upstream are trapping sediments that could have built up the river deltas that make up the Sundarbans. Other human activities such as deforestation encourage erosion.

A 2013 study by the Zoological Society of London measured the Sundarbans coastline retreating at about 650 feet a year. The Geological Survey of India says at least 81 square miles of coastline on the Indian side has eroded in the last few decades. At least four islands are underwater and dozens of others have been abandoned due to sea rise and erosion.

Many scientists believe the only long-term solution is for most of the Sundarbans population to leave. That may be not only necessary but environmentally beneficial, giving shorn mangrove forests a chance to regrow and capture river sediment in their tangled, saltwater-tolerant roots.

""The chance of a mass migration, to my mind, is actually pretty high. India is not recognizing it for whatever reason,"" said Anurag Danda, who leads the World Wildlife Fund's climate change adaptation program in the Sundarbans. ""It's a crisis waiting to happen. We are just one event away from seeing large-scale displacement and turning a large number of people into destitutes.""

West Bengal is no stranger to mass migration. Kolkata, its capital, has been overrun three times by panicked masses fleeing violence or starvation: during a 1943 famine, the 1947 partition and the 1971 war that created today's Bangladesh.

India, however, has no official plan either to help relocate Sundarbans residents or to protect the region from further ecological decline.

""We need international help. We need national help. We need the help of the people all over the world. We are very late"" in addressing the problem, said West Bengal state's minister for emergencies and disaster management, Janab Javed Ahmed Khan. He said West Bengal must work urgently with the Indian and Bangladeshi governments to take action.

Bangladesh is supporting scientists ""trying to find out whether it's possible to protect the Sundarbans,"" said Taibur Rahman, of the Bangladesh government's planning commission. ""But we are already experiencing the effects of climate change. The people of the Sundarbans are resilient and have long lived with hardship, but many now are leaving. And we are not yet prepared.""

A network of concrete dykes and barriers, like those protecting the Netherlands, offers limited protection to some of the islands in Bangladesh's portion of the Sundarbans. The World Bank is now spending some $200 million to improve those barriers.

Experts worry that politicians will ignore the problem or continue to make traditional promises to build roads, schools and hospital clinics. This could entice more people to the region just when everyone should be moving out.

""We have 15 years ... that's the rough time frame I give for sea level rise to become very difficult and population pressure to become almost unmanageable,"" said Jayanta Bandopadhyay, an engineer and science professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi who has studied the region for years.

Bandopadhyay and other experts say India and Bangladesh should be creating jobs, offering skills training, freeing lands and making urbanization attractive so people will feel empowered to leave.

Even if India musters that kind of political will, planning and funds, persuading people to move will not be easy.

Most families have been living here since the early 1800s, when the British East India Company -- which then governed India, Pakistan and Bangladesh for the British Empire -- removed huge mangrove forests to allow people to live on and profit from the fertile agricultural land.

Even those who are aware of the threat of rising seas don't want to leave.

""You cannot fight with water,"" said Sorojit Majhi, a 36-year-old father of four young girls living in a hut crouched behind a crumbling mud embankment. Majhi's ancestral land has also been swallowed by the sea. He admits he's sometimes angry, other times depressed.

""We are scared, but where can we go?"" he said. ""We cannot fly away like a bird.""","Thu, 19 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/02/19/854b8fc8-d215-485c-995a-b6a257f8f19b/thumbnail/1200x630/318356e89d7c1a880d9de55a5cd9beb0/sundarbansindiaap967442025283.jpg,"['india', 'sea', 'population', 'seas', 'million', 'rise', 'sundarbans', 'force', 'region', 'rising', 'bengal', 'bangladesh', 'largestever', 'exodus', 'human']",

My paternal Grandfather grew up in the very characterful and typically east London area of Brick Lane, and incessantly recounted that London was the only “free city”, unique because you could spend a full day enjoying the delights of museums and galleries littered on “Museum Street” and further afield, with absolutely no financial expenditure necessary.

The landmarks and the appearance of a major capital city’s skyline help us identify and characterise a city. For people like me who hold the map upside-down, these landmarks are not only attractive but also practical in the sense that they will help us to navigate our way around the city.



If a city is to please us, it needs to maintain the opposite of everything defined as “boring” although let’s hope that doesn’t entail anything too dangerous! The School of Life recommends avoiding “sameness” and I agree completely. Most major cities distinguish the nature of different parts of the city itself in terms of cardinal points (north, east, south, and west) or using other categories and it makes sense to do so.

It is important that a city cares for and protects its history and London has definitely succeeded in this case. History is everywhere in London: Victorian and Tudor architecture is everywhere for people to see as is the protected remains of the London Wall and the replica of the gate to this in Aldgate ... When my grandfather reminisced on his time in London, I was young and couldn’t place the areas that he was referring to. There is such a strong focus on preserving the history of London and because of this I feel that I can trace his footsteps as he recounted rushing to a a piano performance during World War Two.

Armed with a Samoan passport, Palmerston North firefighter Anne Cairns is launching another bid for the Olympics, this time Rio 2016 in flatwater kayaking.

With a paddle in her hand, the 34-year-old has filled countless New Zealand passports travelling the globe in a multitude of water sports, then spending years paying it all off.

Her parents have lived in New Zealand for about 40 years, and her mother, Koko, is Samoan. That pushed Cairns into taking out dual New Zealand-Samoan citizenship to open up sporting doors.

She first tried flatwater paddling between 2005 and 2009, taking it up late at 25, the age world champion Lisa Carrington is now.

Cairns had been on track for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, only for it all to go haywire. At World Cups in Hungary and France, one woman in their K4 four-woman crew injured her back and a Hungarian woman's New Zealand residency was turned down.

""It was terrible, a bad trip to Europe,"" Cairns recalled.

From there she tried the solo K1, finished second to Erin Taylor who went to the Olympics, and stuck it out for two years before taking up waka ama canoeing and returning to rafting.

Back in a kayak at the New Zealand and Oceania championships at Karapiro at the weekend, Cairns finished top Oceania paddler outside the New Zealanders and Australians in the K1 200m and 500m.

So she hopes New Zealand and Australia each qualify one paddler for Olympics A-final spots, leaving an Oceania boat opening for Cairns.

After leaving Palmerston North Girls' High School, Cairns was a ski paddler at Himatangi Beach. She still dabbles in surf with the Ocean Beach club in Hawke's Bay and two years ago won the national mixed double ski title.

""It's a lifestyle thing, paddling.""

From surf she moved to wild-water canoeing, formerly known as downriver. In those days Phil Dooney and Aaron Cox were coaching wild-water in Manawatu and it was a boom minor sport.

Cairns has raced all over Europe and just two years ago was back paddling at a World Cup in Serbia.

Then whitewater rafting came along with the New Zealand crew at the world championships on the Zambezi River in Africa in 2001 dodging hippos and crocodiles. At Costa Rica they finished third on appeal, last year won the world title at Rotorua and this year she will be in Indonesia, flying the New Zealand flag, not Samoa's.

""My priority is flat-water and my slim chance of getting in to the Olympics,"" she said.

However, she must contest the worlds in Milan, Italy, in August.

Talk about a traveller. Even on the home front, Cairns commutes weekly to Palmerston North from Dannevirke where her partner lives. Sometimes she trains on a 750m long farm lake near Takapau. In Palmerston North the Manawatu River is now too low, so she heads to Foxton or Centennial Lagoon.

""The lagoon is the only place local I can train and being covered in weed, it makes my life hell. I'm hoping for rain soon.""

With degrees in physical education and human performance, firefighting suits her.

""Paddling and having upper body strength is what got me in to the fire service,"" she said.

She has been there 2 1/2 years and loves it with the brown watch crew.","Tue, 17 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/3/g/q/v/3/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.13gl7g.png/1424127933210.jpg,"['olympic', 'flatwater', 'palmerston', 'paddler', 'zealand', 'olympics', 'taking', 'oceania', 'world', 'north', 'kayaking', 'cairns', 'dream']",

• Cruciferous vegetables contain vitamins, minerals, other nutrients, and chemicals known as glucosinolates.

• Glucosinolates break down into several biologically active compounds that are being studied for possible anticancer effects.

• Some of these compounds have shown anticancer effects in cells and animals, but the results of studies with humans have been less clear.

What are cruciferous vegetables?

Cruciferous vegetables are part of the Brassica genus of plants. They include the following vegetables, among others:

Arugula

Bok choy

Broccoli

Brussels sprouts

Cabbage

Cauliflower

Collard greens

Horseradish

Kale

Radishes

Rutabaga

Turnips

Watercress

Wasabi

Why are cancer researchers studying cruciferous vegetables?

Cruciferous vegetables are rich in nutrients, including several carotenoids (beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin); vitamins C, E, and K; folate; and minerals. They also are a good fiber source.

In addition, cruciferous vegetables contain a group of substances known as glucosinolates, which are sulfur-containing chemicals. These chemicals are responsible for the pungent aroma and bitter flavor of cruciferous vegetables.

During food preparation, chewing, and digestion, the glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables are broken down to form biologically active compounds such as indoles, nitriles, thiocyanates, and isothiocyanates (1). Indole-3-carbinol (an indole) and sulforaphane (an isothiocyanate) have been most frequently examined for their anticancer effects.

Indoles and isothiocyanates have been found to inhibit the development of cancer in several organs in rats and mice, including the bladder, breast, colon, liver, lung, and stomach (2, 3). Studies in animals and experiments with cells grown in the laboratory have identified several potential ways in which these compounds may help prevent cancer:

They help protect cells from DNA damage.

They help inactivate carcinogens.

They have antiviral and antibacterial effects.

They have anti-inflammatory effects.

They induce cell death (apoptosis).

They inhibit tumor blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) and tumor cell migration (needed for metastasis).

Studies in humans, however, have shown mixed results, as described in Question 3.

Is there evidence that cruciferous vegetables can help reduce cancer risk in people?

Researchers have investigated possible associations between intake of cruciferous vegetables and the risk of cancer. The evidence has been reviewed by various experts. Key studies regarding four common forms of cancer are described briefly below.

• Prostate cancer: Cohort studies in the Netherlands (4), United States (5), and Europe (6) have examined a wide range of daily cruciferous vegetable intakes and found little or no association with prostate cancer risk. However, some case-control studies have found that people who ate greater amounts of cruciferous vegetables had a lower risk of prostate cancer (7, 8).

• Colorectal cancer: Cohort studies in the United States and the Netherlands have generally found no association between cruciferous vegetable intake and colorectal cancer risk (9-11). The exception is one study in the Netherlands—the Netherlands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer—in which women (but not men) who had a high intake of cruciferous vegetables had a reduced risk of colon (but not rectal) cancer (12).

• Lung cancer: Cohort studies in Europe, the Netherlands, and the United States have had varying results (13-15). Most studies have reported little association, but one U.S. analysis—using data from the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals’ Follow-up Study—showed that women who ate more than 5 servings of cruciferous vegetables per week had a lower risk of lung cancer (16).

• Breast cancer: One case-control study found that women who ate greater amounts of cruciferous vegetables had a lower risk of breast cancer (17). A meta-analysis of studies conducted in the United States, Canada, Sweden, and the Netherlands found no association between cruciferous vegetable intake and breast cancer risk (18). An additional cohort study of women in the United States similarly showed only a weak association with breast cancer risk (19).

A few studies have shown that the bioactive components of cruciferous vegetables can have beneficial effects on biomarkers of cancer-related processes in people. For example, one study found that indole-3-carbinol was more effective than placebo in reducing the growth of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix (20).

In addition, several case-control studies have shown that specific forms of the gene that encodes glutathione S-transferase, which is the enzyme that metabolizes and helps eliminate isothiocyanates from the body, may influence the association between cruciferous vegetable intake and human lung and colorectal cancer risk (21-23).

Are cruciferous vegetables part of a healthy diet?

The federal government’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 recommend consuming a variety of vegetables each day. Different vegetables are rich in different nutrients.

Vegetables are categorized into five subgroups: dark-green, red and orange, beans and peas (legumes), starchy, and other vegetables. Cruciferous vegetables fall into the “dark-green vegetables” category and the “other vegetables” category. More information about vegetables and diet, including how much of these foods should be eaten daily or weekly, is available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture website Choose My Plate.

Higher consumption of vegetables in general may protect against some diseases, including some types of cancer. However, when researchers try to distinguish cruciferous vegetables from other foods in the diet, it can be challenging to get clear results because study participants may have trouble remembering precisely what they ate. Also, people who eat cruciferous vegetables may be more likely than people who don’t to have other healthy behaviors that reduce disease risk. It is also possible that some people, because of their genetic background, metabolize dietary isothiocyanates differently. However, research has not yet revealed a specific group of people who, because of their genetics, benefit more than other people from eating cruciferous vegetables.

Holt, who hosted the weekend edition of the Nightly News on Saturday, mentioned the news about his colleague and read out a statement. However he did not elaborate and didn't mention the fact he will be taking over.

Brian Williams has announced he is temporarily stepping down from his job as anchor at NBC Nightly News

Williams has also been accused of fabricating elements of his time in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.

While reporting on the ground he said he saw a body floating down the street, and caught dysentery from flood water.

As a result of the controversy, the veteran journalist is at risk from rivals who want his job, according to the New York Daily News.

Former NBC presenter, and current Yahoo! News personality Katie Couric, had been linked with the role, but a spokesman ruled her out on Saturday.

Williams confessed that he 'made a mistake recalling' a flight he took on a Chinook helicopter over Iraq in 2003.

'Made a mistake recalling': Williams, shown left in Iraq and right in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, has found his claims met with scrutiny

'I AM PRESENTLY TOO MUCH A PART OF THE NEWS': BRIAN WILLIAMS' STATEMENT IN FULL In the midst of a career spent covering and consuming news, it has become painfully apparent to me that I am presently too much a part of the news, due to my actions.' As Managing Editor of NBC Nightly News, I have decided to take myself off of my daily broadcast for the next several days, and Lester Holt has kindly agreed to sit in for me to allow us to adequately deal with this issue. Upon my return, I will continue my career-long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us. Advertisement

He has previously said the aircraft he was on was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade that miraculously didn't explode, and managed to land with no loss of life.

In the most extreme version of the tale, told to David Letterman in March 2013, he said: 'Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire, including the one I was in, RPG and AK-47.'

In fact, he was on a different aircraft entirely, which by some accounts was as much as an hour behind the one helicopter which was actually hit.

He recanted his account after being called out by veterans who really were on the chopper.

NBC has launched an official probe into Williams, lead by Richard Esposito, its top investigative journalist.

Since the apology, questions were also raised about statements Williams made on coverage of Hurricane Katrina, which was one of his proudest moments at NBC.

He claimed to see a body floating down the street in the French Quarter of New Orleans, past the Ritz-Carlton hotel where he was staying.

Sore spot: Williams's Friday broadcast opened with an exclusive story from Iraq - the country from which Williams's much-maligned error stemmed

In a 2006 interview he referenced the moment: 'When you look out of your hotel room window in the French Quarter and watch a man float by face down, when you see bodies that you last saw in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, and swore to yourself that you would never see in your country'.

Some are sceptical of the story, as the French Quarter was not extensively flooded in the disaster, bringing into question whether there would have been enough water for a body to float down the street.

He has also claimed that flood water gave him dysentery, which medics have said was not prevalent during Katrina.

Nonetheless, Williams's top two items tonight were on the very subjects under most scrutiny. He led the broadcast with a story from the struggle with ISIS in Iraq, then moved on to the impact of extreme weather in America, included flooding in California.

As well as the internal probe, the Daily News also reported that 'a secret task-force' from the rival ABC network is also dredging up old footage of Williams in the hope of finding more claims which do not withstand scrutiny.

According to the newspaper, Ben Sherwood, the president of Disney-ABC Television Group, ordered the task-force himself - but the network has strongly denied such a group exists.

The News also outlined another threat allegedly closing in on Williams - his former NBC colleague Katie Couric, now a big-name anchor at Yahoo! Global News.

A source told the paper: 'Katie still has deep, deep contacts at NBC. She would love to return as the Nightly News anchor... She wants to be back in the big leagues again.'

Others denied she had designs on the NBC top spot.","Sat, 07 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/07/25715EEE00000578-0-image-a-25_1423346636644.jpg,"['broadcast', 'brian', 'daily', 'anchor', 'nbc', 'williamss', 'trust', 'row', 'williams', 'lies', 'nightly', 'amid', 'iraq', 'told', 'steps']",

A bird sits on a branch

of the fury tree:

a bird as big as India.

It’s sleeping now.

You can see it

if you tilt your head.

It’s crouched inside

the amber paperweight

on my desk:

shrunken, waiting for release.

The Burden of History





You never meant to trap us in that country

without a post office, where boatmen and saints

trade stories to while away the days

of khaki captivity. No, Beloved Witness,

these were signposts you’d sketched

at the lake’s treacherous edge, to break our fall

as we hurtled down the foothills of policy.

Colours for a Landscape Held Captive, in memoriam: Agha Shahid Ali (1949-2001)





As the soldier’s sister, who saddled shadows,

she rode through the dark, grey dappled on grey,

ringing her bell.

As the farmer’s wife, who chopped garlic and diced carrots

against the clock, she had the best practice of all,

watching the guillotine fall.

As the priest’s mother, she hung up her laundry

on a line sagging between sand-pitted columns,

picking head after head from her basket.

As the swan girl, she polished the bronze horses

every summer till they sweated against the colonnade,

printing their heat on her baby’s cradle.

And her hand, this hand that is writing:

you can slip it off any time you like

and try on another silk glove.





A door. A stair. ...

the straight-backed chair my grandmother sat in ...

a volume of stories

open at the flyleaf ...

A Poem for Grandmother





This is the first and last portrait. After this

no questions, after this you can shed

the mantle of affection, the scarf of duty. ...

You can become a god.





The saint maintains his piety through the graphic imagination of other people’s vices. We thank him for it.

The saint’s impossible perfection allows us to go on being gargoyles while keeping our faith alive. We admire him for it.

The saint’s silence covers far more than our interpretations of it.

The saint has stood in the cave of light. He has spoken to the spirits of trees. His poetry is the fan of the white peacock opening against the rough shrubbery of our speech.

For example





That hand. Surely, sir, you saw it move?

Surely you saw it clench

like a hairclip clutching at vanished hair,

like a velvet crab scuttling out of water

on the way to its next victim.

The Memoirs of Don Quixote



History rarely mentions grandmothers. And yet grandmothers are usually the first historians we encounter. “I will refer to this mystic-poet by her most celebrated and non-sectarian appellation, 'Lal Ded'. In the colloquial, this means 'Grandmother Lal'; more literally, it means 'Lal the Womb', a designation that connects her to the mother goddesses whose cults of fecundity and abundance form the deep substratum of Indic religious life,” writes Ranjit Hoskote, arguably one of India’s finest poets writing in English today, this in his extremely well-researched introduction to the recent I, Lalla: The Poems of Lal Ded, his translation of the verses of the medieval Kashmiri saint poet.In this seemingly innocent address, Hoskote is doing something remarkable – ­like a good usher, he is showing us where the vacant seats of history are. But he does not leave it at that – Grandmother Lal is not just a historical figure he will turn the spotlight on. Grandmother Lal, so long “crystallised into an archetypal narrative of the misunderstood young woman with spiritual ambitions” in our consciousness, becomes a product of history in Hoskote’s introduction.Born somewhere between 1301 and 1320 either in Sempore near Pampore, or in Pandrenthan nea Srinagar to a Brahmin family and married at the age of twelve, “she was given a new name, Padmavati, but remained Lalla in her own eyes”. Her marriage was unhappy, she was treated cruelly by her husband and starved by her mother-in-law, and at the age of twenty six, Grandmother Lal renounced the worldly life. She became a parivrajika, a wandering mendicant.Hoskote notes that “this was not an easy choice for a Brahmin woman to make in the Kashmir of the fourteenth century.” He traces her journey from this confused young girl tortured by the shackles of domesticity to the “questor and teacher” whose poems draw their energy from their author’s experience of being a yogini and the devotional practices of Kashmi Saivite mysticism.Why Grandmother Lal and why is “herstory” such a knotted blur in our public history of literature and religion? It is easy to guess the first reason: she was a woman. Hoskote attributes the misrepresentation and occlusion of this aberrational woman to Kashmiri historians, all of whom “concerned themselves with the documentation of dynastic fortunes and shifting political alliances, with accounts of the economy and the climate; with the transformation of religious life through political change.” It becomes easier to spot Hoskote’s agenda now. The rejection of patriarchal historiography and its safe places is one, of course, but the other I find even more energising: he invites and invokes an interiority in our understanding of history, one missing from grand narratives.Poem 96 from his translations is a good instructive illustration:The privileging of the “kingdom” over the “Self” that we notice in Lal Ded’s poetry is one that Hoskote challenges in his intellectual biography about the poet.History has reserved only one role for the grandmother: she is to be a storyteller, not a historian. The most popular book of Bangla children’s stories, for instance, is called Thakumar Jhooli, literally “grandmother’s bag”. What kind of stories can Grandmother Lal tell?Hoskote is pointing a finger here again, for in Grandmother Lal’s stories, kings and queens don’t live in palaces; hers is a history of the trials of the self, and when has a child – or a historiographer – been interested in the invisible? It is only the male who is allowed his banwas, his voluntary exile; a male renouncer will become a saint. But the grandmother? Do grandmothers find mention in the books of lives of saints?“Teri nani mari toh mein kya karu ...” goes a popular Hindi film song. What am I to do if your grandmother is dead? Says something, doesn’t it?This is a good time to ask: who are Ranjit Hoskote’s grandmothers?“I do not envy you this brief, biographer.” So wrote Hoskote in the poem Questions for a Biographer (Vanishing Acts: New and Selected Poems 1985-2005). A good instruction.Nevertheless, Hoskote’s grandsonhood is a good perch from which to look upon his nearly quarter of a century of writing.The massive output, if one can borrow that term from industrial production to describe a writer's insect-like life of collection and deposition, with five collections of poems, Zones of Assault, The Cartographer’s Apprentice, The Sleepwalker’s Archive, Vanishing Acts: New and Selected Poems 1985-2005, and the recently published Central Time, along with his art criticism and work as an editor of an anthology of poetry, Reasons for Belonging, and the outstanding Dom Moraes: Collected Poems, might make us forget that Ranjit Hoskote is only 45 years old. Born in 1969, he began writing poems when he was still a student at Bombay Scottish School.What Hoskote writes about Moraes, one of the few Indian poets he has confessed to sharing a literary ancestry with, in his Introduction to Dom Moraes: Selected Poems, holds true for him too.Poetry had announced its claim on Moraes very early. Like many children destined to become writers, especially if they happen to be their parents’ only child, he was a reclusive non-athlete and a misfit at school. Both Campion and St Mary’s, in Bombay, were Catholic institutions that emphasises sport alongside their academic curricula; Moraes did not defy so much as he sidestepped his teachers’ expectations, withdrawing easily into the domain of his own richly populated imagination.At Bombay’s Elphinstone College, Hoskote studied Politics, Sociology and Economics, later taking an MA in Literature & Aesthetics. Elphinstone would bring two things into his life: the energy of art; the other was the woman who would eventually become his wife. Hoskote’s wife, Nancy Adajania, is a cultural theorist and curator who has, among other things, researched India's craft traditions and the contemporary forms emerging from them.Here is Hoskote in an email to me: “Nancy and I met in college – Elphinstone College, Bombay – in 1988. We were both students of the social sciences. Elphinstone was then in the last phase of a particularly inspired period in its history, 1960s-1990s, during which it had been variously a hotbed for Left-wing uprising, a stage for intellectual debate, a site of resistance during the Emergency, and a crucible for the emergence of new forms of thought and expression. ... Also, the Jehangir Art Gallery was just across the road, as was Max Mueller Bhavan and the Centre for Education & Documentation, a broadly Left-liberal library and research centre – and for Nancy and me, these became integral components of our growing up.”But to return to Hoskote’s grandmothers. “Both my grandmothers passed away before I was born. The presence and narrative of my paternal grandmother, Chandrabhaga Hoskote, informs some of my poems . . . ; my maternal grandmother, Radha Nagarkatti, does not appear quite as manifestly in my poems, but I do have a cycle of poems in draft form that draw on stories about her. All that I know of my grandmothers is put together from circulating family folklore, photographs, and the stories my parents told me about them; so, in some profound sense, my knowledge of them is based on an archaeological exploration.” Family folklore, archaeological exploration, photographs, poems – this is the archive from which grandmothers and their histories need to be excavated .Hoskote’s paternal grandmother belonged to a family that had transited from landowning to entrepreneurship; she was multilingual, “an integral aspect of Saraswat culture, given our diasporic history”, the Saraswat Brahmins traced their origin to the Indus-Saraswati civilisation, and her languages were Konkani, English, Kannada, Tamil, and Sanskrit. His maternal grandmother’s father was a doctor who had returned to look after the family's lands and committed himself to the people of the region, the Andle region in North Kanara. Her languages were Konkani, English, Marathi and Hindi, as well as Sanskrit.It was this polyglossia, both linguistic and cultural, one inherited from his family, the other coming to him from Bombay’s peculiarly rich environment that was collected like essence in a bottle in Elphinstone that shaped him. Why is this knowledge of Hoskote’s histories important to our understanding of his work?The first of those reasons would be obvious to attentive observers of English poetry in India – Hoskote is perhaps the only one of this generation of poets who has written diligently and astutely about poets he considers owing intellectual debts to. He called an anthology of poetry that he edited, by fourteen Indian poets writing in English , Reasons for Belonging (2002). That phrase holds in it his commitment to the concept of “tradition” in literary history. In his essays – intellectual homages – on Nissim Ezekiel, Adil Jussawalla, and Dom Moraes, whose poems he edited and collected for the Penguin Modern Classics Series, or the painstaking labour of collecting and interpreting Lalla’s work, we see a man who is acutely aware of where his shadow falls, and where the light is.From his literary homages to these writers, it is possible to glean an idea about the kind of writer Hoskote was aiming to be. In Ezekiel, he admires the poet’s “sustained meditation on the act of poetry, its ability to testify to experience, but much more vitally, to act as a mode of knowledge”; Arun Kolatkar, he finds “nourished ... by his private engagements with literature, painting, design and society. ... Unlike many other poets, who struggle to sustain their sensibilities against the grain of their day-jobs, Mr Kolatkar profited from his involvement in visualisation and design.”About Dom Moraes, he writes, “Although already in the grip of cancer, he left for Ahmedabad as soon as the post-Godhra pogrom launched by Hindu right-wing goon squads against the Muslim minority erupted in late February 2002. The former war correspondent was traumatised by the evil he saw there, regarding it as worse than any he had seen in Algeria, Vietnam and Indonesia.”Having quoted from Moraes’s powerful poem, A Day in Ayodhya, Hoskote writes, “In this last phase ... he ... saw himself as a self-among-others, his and their destinies bound inextricably together. The mythopoeic nature of his poetry now acquired a dimension of urgent historicity. ... he was now a contributor to the unfolding scenarios of its collective life. He embraced that responsibility”. The responsibility of the poet to poetry, the relationship between visual art and poetry, the “urgent historicity”, the things he admires in Ezekiel, Kolatkar and Moraes respectively, are to be found in his own.Hoskote’s emails are often as full of the eye’s pulse as his poems, and so when I ask him about the letters he wrote and received from these writers he admired, he says, “Nissim famously communicated through postcards; I have most of the ones he wrote me, but would have to trawl through the so-called archives (essentially, several trunks, some overstuffed drawers, and bags). Dom would call. From Adil, I have some cover letters for texts, archival material or photocopies that he would share, as well as notes on index-card-shaped notepaper... again, scattered and to be pulled together someday, I hope.” Even in this informal conversation, it is impossible not to notice Hoskote’s instinct for preservation, for maintaining records. Does that explain why the “archive” must be one of the most important metaphors in his body of work, both prose and poetry?This understanding of time, as an invisible agent that is responsible for “history”, explains why “Time”, as word and concept in Central Time, his most recent collection of poems, is there for a good reason. “My general logic for Central Time was to develop an architecture of one hundred poems, to celebrate forms such as the sataka and the century, and to have it unfold as a cycle in five phases. Each phase or section would have 20 poems, and would articulate, so to speak, the mind-space of a particular character or temperament. Somewhere near the completion of the book – and this was triggered off by a re-reading of Bachelard (the French philosopher who wrote extensively on poetics of space and the philosophy of science) – I thought I could detect the presence, in each section, of a dominant element, or combination of elements, which made compelling sense, albeit retrospectively (remember that all this is subtext, my own private coding – and if it breaks surface and comes across or signals its presence, that's great!).”Time, Sataka, Century – time’s calibrations, the clockwork of history, here in five sections. The first is Zoetrope, a cylinder used to create the illusion of motion in pre-cinema times – the stage is the mind of a man with a magic lantern. Every time he needs the new, he twirls his magic lantern and a fresh relay of images appear – buildings, bridges, houses, cathedrals, plans, earthworks. Earth, with air, is the prevailing element. “The graves are numbered, without verses or seasons to ground them” (“Numbers”, Central Time), a zoetrope of numbers, begging for history.This is history’s new discourse, where the day is too anorexic to hold the names of those who die every day, and so numbers. And so the graveyard as archive. In this marvellous first section, we see glimpses of the Hoskote of The Cartographer’s Apprentice (2000), a collaborative project that the poet worked on with the painter Laxman Shreshtha, a dialogue between text and image that foreshadows the poems in the Zoetrope section. That shouldn’t come as a surprise, given that Hoskote is one of India’s best art historians, having spent more than two decades curating, collaborating and writing about the country’s artists, on Atul Dodiya, Manu Parekh, Sudhir Patwardhan, Ganesh Pyne, Jehangir Sabavala, among others.When I asked him whether he was a closet painter, he said, “I began, in some sense, as a painter. I loved to paint, and was immersed in the history of art, and was thought rather good at painting. Alas, that was my undoing. I became the sort of lad that's trundled out by the school for every inter-school competition, and is expected to return bearing prizes. This I duly did for a number of years, until at length the whole business began to pall on me. I retreated into painting for myself, at home. Midway through my BA, I was appointed art critic to The Times of India, Bombay – after which, as the years passed, the more I wrote on visual art the less I was inclined to produce any of it myself. The last thing I painted was a collaborative mural in the quadrangle of Elphinstone in 1989. In any case, my career as a poet had taken off by then.” Only a painter could write these lines: “The sliced apple/has elephants’ eyes for pips:/they stare up at the knife/that has brought them to life.” (Still Life); “The door’s frozen/like a stag in the glare of a headlight” (Coda); “A gash of sunlight on a lemon door” (Freehold); and my favourite: “The water is crumpling in your hands” (The Strange Case of Mr Narrative’s Reluctance).Because our first reaction – and record – of violence is the visual, the poet allows history its frames – how else does one tame time? “We’ve caught a trace of the moment’s passage: the stain spreading on this page, a twist of ink, machine oil or deer’s blood. You say you can record it? ... You’re writing the future’s memory” (Native Informant). Here is the domestic life of history – the “trace”, the “stain” “twist”, their visuals recorded by those who work at what Hoskote calls the “Institute of Silence”. This is how Hoskote spots the machinations of history, its blood and bodies on display in the world outside, but where it lives permanently is the interior, where “stain” and scar, “ink” and spillage, “oil” and grime are.Section 2, The Pilot's Almanac, is the record of a pilot struggling to keep his calendar in order even as archetypal patterns impose themselves on history, while forward speed is resisted by the drag of memory. Weather and terror explode with equal force. And history doesn’t know where to hide. The title of the poem is annotation enough:My favourite section is the third – Gravity Leaps to the Eye is in the voice of narrators who struggle between nomadism and place, momentum and gravity; its tropes are sight, location, illusion, mirage, occasions missed and potential, self and proxy, inhabit these poems. In it is a poem that has become a personal favourite. It is called “Fossil Curator”; in it Hoskote takes familiar tropes from palaeontology, archaeology, geology and turns them inside out. The result is a Rene Magritte like teasing line: after the descriptions of the “fossil curator”, “his fingers drum on mahogany, a beat coded in the bone”, the survey of the “parchment landscape”, Hoskote writes – “These events are no less real for taking place inside a head”. Grandmother history again: our history is also the stories inside us, real and imagined, the latter fluid, n plus one. History’s surplus.The fourth section is The Existence Certificate, and it is a catalogue of feints, sleights, exits, entries, passages between histories, between fictions, treading the ground of the museum of discarded identities and superseded affiliations, revisitations of childhood, intimate memory, ruin and retrieval. In it I found Hoskote’s childhood, moving between the mountains and the sea, Kashmir and Goa, both now memory, the sea crashing against the hills in a way it is only possible in a poet’s memory. Here is the history of the historian, the histories of the mountain and the sea, the geologies that produce different kinds of men and their literatures, the eye level of the mountains, the ground level of water, a geographical cosmopolitanism that can only give birth to the most fantastic poetry.One such – another favourite – is Botany. “Clove and mandrake/open the mouths of your mind, all dialogue here/is rolling transcript for a police state.” You can see botany being infused with the apparatus of political history, and you pause for another fantastic thought to come your way. The poet doesn’t disappoint. This, said to the “prickly garden” – “give nothing away/except your deep-shelved archive of silences.”“The idea of the archive has always been strong in my work, and that became intensified in The Sleepwalker’s Archive,” Hoskote tells the poet Arundhati Subramaniam in an interview in Poetry International on 1st June 2005. “I found myself confronted by the fear of the loss of memory, the loss of language. This fear was shaped by factors as diverse as friend and poet Nissim Ezekiel’s struggle with Alzheimer’s close at hand, as well as the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas in a more global context. There was also a sense of loss at the community of poets dispersing, after the strong feeling of connection that some of us had shared at the Poetry Circle in Bombay in the early ’90s. I think Sleepwalker also reveals an ability to move more comfortably through works of visual art.”The archive is both reservoir and valve, one that allows, in Hoskote’s words, “the passage between histories”. In an interview with Nether magazine, for instance, he speaks passionately about how the ‘acts of retrieval’ of the archive should not be limited by personal ideology or interest but include things that disrupt our safe passages of thought. Particularly striking is his belief that such an archive, catholic and an embodiment of difference, would lead the poet to epiphany.What has wandered across both history and imagined histories is the personality of violence. More than any contemporary writer that I know of, Hoskote’s work has been in creating an archive of our civilisation’s demons (an oxymoron, I am aware), a provenance of blood. In Zones of Assault (1991), he records the acrobatics of this violence of centuries. It is not Safdar Hashmi, for instance, who is memorialised in Assassination of an Artist, but his death: “dragged from his altar/the rebel priest”; “The bleached grass clotting a flood of wounds”.In this early book, one can see Hoskote coming to violence as a visual artist might – it is the superstition of colour, a blood red. 1917, a poem whose title is itself a mass graveyard, has the colour “red” play out its different energies – “Red sickles sprang/From the snowbound soil” to “And the gauntlets went red/With dissident throats”. His poems document the long and interminable career of human violence. In Report of War: Kosala, 900 BC (Vanishing Acts: New and Selected Poems 1985-2005), “the river has choked on bodies, theirs and ours”, “the hills have flattened/at our conquering feet”.What binds these poems together is the conviction that we are not less violent than the next person. So behind the veil of beauty, of sweetness and light, is blood, “theirs and ours”. His poem for Agha Shahid Ali uses that phrase that has now become colloquial in poetry circles, “country without a post office”, but as in the title where the word “Captive” turns the hollowness of “Colours for a Landscape” inside out, Hoskote purposely punctures the beauty, both of Ali’s lines and the terrible beauty they commemorate:In the “Introduction” to Reasons for Belonging, Hoskote catalogues the characteristics of the 14 Indian poets he is anthologising. In them we see a manifesto as it were, of his reasons to think of poetry as a collective archive – the poets are “playing witness, they bear testimony to society and its confusions; playing archaeologist, they investigate lost imprints of thought and expressiveness”; “they dwell on the persistences of historical memory; they fasten on events that course through the bloodstream or spark along the nervous system, to explode in the brain ... they counter the grand narratives of official history with dissident versions”.Section 5 of Central Time, The Institute of Silence, does exactly the same. The poem Revolution is a great illustration of what I have been calling Grandmother History.The figures of these women, rehearsing their rituals of violence, are a parallel history that must enter our records and our archives. Central Time makes us aware, on every page, that violence does not live only on battlefields or in the nozzle of a gun. It is inside these women, incubating inside the seemingly satin surface of domesticity, it is also inside books and arguments, and more than everything else, it is inside the heart: ‘Heart ... Will the historians decorate you/for all the wars you fought?” (Evening Landscape).As it turns out, neither the interviewer at Nether magazine nor I are alone to think of the grandmother trope as utterly significant in Hoskote’s work. Claus Telge, a German scholar, in his essay, “Re-imagining the notion of home: Metaphors of memory in the poetry of Ranjit Hoskote”, rightfully reads the Grandmother poem as an “archive” (that the poem is from The Sleepwalker’s Archive only reiterates his position), as a “building metaphor that represents the storage capacity of memory, i.e., an accumulation of, for example, texts, images and films, which form a collective material repository of shared cultural knowledge that shapes and sustains cultural identity”.The Sleepwalker is ambidextrous in his relation to history – he remembers and he forgets; his memory is differently porous at different times, depending on the hour of the day. The title and the image is a remarkable one – Who is to decide what we should remember and how much? Are we good historians of our own selves? Or, how does one remember the dead? Do the dead remember the living? Hoskote’s homage poems to poets, artists, social activists, filmmakers, that are to be found in all his collections of poems – and there are many, dedicated to poets, writers, artists he admired – are meant to archive the lost moments (for that has been the nature of history, to slip and get lost), not as obituaries which hold only the straight lines of a person’s life, but as pointillist art, life as an aggregation of moments and objects.These are the objects that make Grandmother History:The next poem in that collection is Grandfather’s Estate and Hoskote posits the “Estate”, its bureaucratic history, against his grandmother’s “room”. She is “an empress delegating domestic chores”; “Empire was never her creed”. Against the colonial setting of “a city of merchant ships”, the poet-historian is representing two parallel histories – the one at home, the other in the world. The latter has entered history books; the grandmother wasn’t so fortunate – “she grew into the earth, then, a storied fig tree”.Grandmothers would like to sneak into the historical consciousness – so the poet wakes “some nights to find her eyes/staring at me from the mirror”. The mirror, history’s oldest trope, and the eyes of a woman now dead. Hoskote's point of entry into the ageing subconscious is intimate, like a whisper into the ear that never finds its way out. “A principle of growth: as you age, your needs grow fewer and fewer. Or should. But I shouldn't moralize,” he writes in The Last Annal of Alamgir.History, public memory, the intimacy of ambition, the difference between the two bearers of history's coffin, the grandmother and the emperor. Hence the epigraph to Central Time, which comes from the sociologist Richard Sennett: ""The skilled restorer of porcelain will collect not only the visible chips of a broken pot but also the dust on the table where it rested..."".I’ll quote from the last poem in Central Time – it is, in the queer time-mix of its title, The First and Last Portrait, a piece of delicate irony about the elitism of those who can choose to live outside history.Only for “god” is the equivalence of the first and the last, this history puncturing simultaneity, this dissolving of chronos, only for “god”.Hoskote’s interest in history takes him to institutionalised religion and how saint poets such as Lalla and Sant Tukaram have challenged it.In an essay titled A Climactic Condition called Tukaram, published in A Pilgrim’s India (2011), a collection of essays edited by Arundhati Subramaniam, Hoskote rejects the two poles of the ritualistic religion and the bureaucratic secular that have drawn the outlines of India’s religious life over the last sixty odd years. “For the devout, a pilgrimage begins in a statement of faith and culminates in an affirmation of faith. For those of us who are not blessed with uncritical devotion, it begins in conversation and curiosity, in the need to test the limits of our strength and our scepticism ... The urge to walk out of ourselves remains strong. ... It was in a spirit receptive both to experiment and epiphany that we set out for Dehu on an unusually rainy April morning in 1994, following the trail of Tukaram, the celebrated saint-poet of the bhagvatsampradaya.”Hoskote’s interest is not only in Tukaram but the Tukaram industry, both devotee and desecrator, that keeps history alive. Here is living history, living religion: “Like Tukaram, we are cocooned beyond radar range of communal pieties and sectarian hostilities here, and (Dilip) Chitre begins to recite an abhanga in honour of the moment. The cadence is picked up immediately, and the verse completed, by a voice from inside the cave. He lives! It is a villager who works in the Cadbury chocolate factory on the plain below, and comes up to the cave to spend his lunch hour in contemplation. An archive in human form, this varkari needs only the opening line to zero in effortlessly on one poem from the more than 4,000 Tukaram compositions preserved in the oral tradition: most of them from the master’s quill, others later interpolations in the canon, all revered by the bhagvatsampradaya. No search engine could have performed better or faster, no iPod could possibly match his pithy wisdom.”About this Hoskote is very clear – the archive is a living organism, and history is not to be found in dead bones and radio dating alone, but in places which record footfall and footprints, the place of worship, the school, the marketplace, the staircase. In this too, his agenda for history from below is evident – all these places are grandmother’s archives. Hoskote’s interest in Tukaram is allied with his commitment to the first gesture at historicising – record keeping. Hence the interest in the materiality of history, in “parchment”.“Parchment was an expensive commodity in the 17th century, and the lines of careful black and red script are packed tightly together on the age-browned manuscript. But the text has been stained by more than age. The visible evidence suggests that it has spent a stretch of time under water at some point in its history. ... The scene is not a hushed, white-walled, centrally air-conditioned museum in Washington DC, Paris or Berlin, but the temple of Vithoba in Dehu; on this early summer day, we are surrounded, not by suave curators and gawking tourists, but by turbaned varkaris who pursue their traditional pilgrimage routes in a spirit of serene devotion, humming abhangas to themselves. Unlike the icon or folio that has been transplanted into the antiseptic environment of a museum – cut away from its natural and cultural ethos, the round of seasons and festivities – this manuscript carries a specific gravity, a deep resonance. By virtue of having remained in the physical context of its origin, a compellingly and visibly symptomatic presence, it prompts the visitor into a vivid awareness of events incised into the terrain around the temple: events that have never really been allowed to become the past, because they are retold and re-enacted in proverb and fable. If the 350-year-old pages of this manuscript record the beatitudes and revelations that their writer experienced, they also tell a sordid tale of the jealousy and fear that he aroused among those who held power in his society. For this is the bhijkivahi, the legendary ‘immersed book’ of Tukaram: the transcript of his abhangas, which he was forced to sink in the Indrayani at the behest of the regional Brahmin orthodoxy.”Hoskote’s interest in the saint poets is not for their poetry alone, but the “collective model of authorship”, with “interpolation”, every voice a brick in the wall,, another “living archive”. And hence his attack on the dirty ‘authenticity’ word: “Authenticity, which demands that we demarcate a pure Ur-text and eliminate all later accretions ... Since the late 1980s, however, Kashmir’s confluential culture has frayed thin under the pressure of a prolonged conflict to which transnational terrorism, State repression and local militancy have all contributed” (I, Lalla).Hoskote has, in numerous lectures and essays, and also through his association with the India chapter of P E N., critiqued this amnesiac interpretation of history. Is it Ranjit Hoskote’s belief in history being a happy hand me down then that makes him return to the image of the hand through his long career? The hand is the most potent political symbol in his work, an aphorism in itself, someone praying with folded hands, another casting votes, punching passwords, turning pages of books, making oneself unique with her fingerprints, blessing children and then holding guns. And then there is the historian’s hand, the “hand that is writing” (Revolution). One hand paints history: ‘I’m painting the numbers back on the clock” (Countdown). The other destroys it: “At night I dream I’m tearing up my letters” (The Poet in Exile).Palmists see the future in the lines on a hand, a historian the past. The poet, always an in-between creature, is an archaeologist who does not wear sanitised gloves. Quite tellingly, an essay by Hoskote on the painter Mehlli Gobhai is titled The Resisting Hand. “Keys to epics, I hold these partisan details/that burn the writing hand/and pierce the eye’s complacencies” (Bearings). The hand also holds mirrors which reflect faces: “This is a face of etched lines, hard/And confident as history”. So “let history be a little afraid” (Leonardo).Sumana Roy writes from Siliguri, a small town in sub-Himalayan Bengal.","Mon, 09 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://s01.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/facebook/705297-71f1333d-70c8-4935-973c-96a58461c7dd.jpg,"['hoskote', 'poetry', 'archive', 'poems', 'poem', 'ranjit', 'poet', 'hoskotes', 'grandmother', 'poets', 'history', 'portrait', 'historian', 'hand']",

Rourkela: Ground breaking ceremony for the Rs 6.37 crore 1 MW Solar PV Power Generation System was preformed at Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP) here on tuesday. Performing the ground breaking ceremony, RSP's CEO G.S.Prasad expressed satisfaction over the start of construction activities of the project which was conceived under his direction.

He exhorted all agencies involved in the project to put in their best efforts to ensure timely completion of the project so that RSP can realize the envisaged benefits.

It is pertinent to note that this solar power plant will be the first of its kind and scale in SAIL. With this, RSP has taken another major step towards fulfilling its commitment to clean and green energy, RSP said in a release.

The 1 MW solar photovoltaic power generation system shall generate solar-electrical power from 3465 solar photovoltaic panels installed over an area of 4.7 acres in the plant premises. 15 string inverters of 60 KW capacity each shall convert the DC power generated by the solar panels to 415VAC power.

This in turn shall be stepped up to 6.6 kV through one 1600 kVA transformer, it said. The power generation system shall be connected to the RSP power system at Administration sub-station, located an approximate distance of 1.2 kM from the project site.

M/s Rays Power Infra Pvt. Ltd, Jaipur are the contractors for setting up the plant which will cost Rs. 6.37 crore. The Project is being executed by Power Distribution Department of RSP and M/s Canyon Consultancy Pvt. Ltd. are the consultants for the project, it said.

The solar installation is scheduled to start power generation by June 15, 2015. The plant is expected to generate 16,48,000 kWH of electrical energy in its first year of operation and the design life of the plant is twenty years.

Power generated from the installation shall be used to meet the Renewable Power Obligation (RPO) prescribed by Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission.

“Fringe” has been described as the “world’s largest and internationally acclaimed multi-arts festival” which can trace its roots in Australia sometime in the 1940s.



Fringe has also shades of the Edinburgh theater festival revered as the “world’s largest and oldest theater festival.”



On Feb. 11, Fringe Manila will hold its opening night at the De La Salle-College of St. Benilde’s School of Design and Arts (DLS-CSB-SDA) building. Running until Mar. 1, Fringe Manila coincides with the Philippine National Arts Month celebrated every February.



In an interview, Prof. Abigail Mapua-Cabanilla, associate dean of New Media Studies at the DLS-CSB-SDA, said her academic institution is “deeply honored to be chosen as one of the major partners of Fringe Manila, especially in its maiden run.”



“We love our CSB students. Fringe Manila productions will involve many CSB students, which will surely benefit them and enhance their skills. This is the reason why we are embracing Fringe Manila,” Mapua-Cabanilla said.



Andre Nikolai Pamintuan, Fringe Manila festival director, said the Manila version of the festival “is an open-access, artist-driven, uncensored arts, and community festival” that will showcase “fresh, daring, and ground-breaking works.”



Joining the roster of more than 200 Fringe festivals globally, Pamintuan said Fringe Manila highlights the emerging and established local artists in the world of theater, literature, music, dance, visual arts, film, cabaret, performance art, circus, and “everything in between.”



In a separate interview, Brett McCallum, Fringe Manila executive producer, said they had “no expectations” when they were initially discussing the possibility of Fringe Manila. “We were just hoping that the Filipino artists would notice us, and use the festival as a creative opportunity to show and market their productions.”



“Now, days before the opening of Fringe Manila, we are absolutely surprised by the huge number of Filipino artists and artistic groups participating on our very first year,” McCallum said. “There is so much creativity around the Philippines.”



Fringe Manila took two years to plan, prepare, and execute. Being the pilot year, Fringe Manila 2015 will showcase an extremely diversified program of productions targeting the demographic of ages 18-30.



“We hope those who don’t really attend art shows will take the risk to go and check out the Fringe Manila offerings. Basically, my advice is jump, get wet, and enjoy the shows,” McCallum said.



McCallum made a strong appeal to the risk-taking audience of Fringe Manila: “After watching the shows, please talk why you like or you do not like particular performances.”



Participating artists in the unprecedented multi-arts festival in the country represent the voices and artistic genres reflecting and challenging traditional, contemporary, and emerging art forms.



Included in the dizzying lineup of shows are stage plays with varied themes such as love, sex, and sexuality; musical theater to be performed by professional and university-based and college-based groups; traditional, modern, and ballet dance productions; point-of-view stand-up comedy shows; visual arts exhibitions; cultural performances at the Fo Guang Shan Mabuhay Temple; and shows by artists from Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia, Romania, Brazil, and Greece.



There are also choral performances and showings of documentaries.



For the audience not to be overwhelmed and to be able to maximize their time, McCallum recommended that they plan well.



“They can watch a matinee show, an evening performance, and then cap the night with a late-night comedy show. With average ticket prices ranging from P200 to P300, one can have a cultural excess for less than P1,000,” McCallum said.



Explore the offerings, make connections with the other audience and artists and producers, and realize that there are “100 unique journeys through the Fringe Manila programs,” McCallum said. — VC, GMA News","Tue, 10 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.gmanews.tv/v3/webpics/v3/2015/02/2015_02_10_19_01_24.jpg,"['risks', 'experience', 'artists', 'mccallum', 'performances', 'shows', 'cultural', 'theater', 'arts', 'productions', 'festival', 'fringe']", 
81,81,FL-2015-000010-IDN,Secrets behind the historic Indian sword 'Shamsheer' revealed - indiatvnews.com,https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/world/secrets-behind-the-historic-indian-sword-shamsheer-revealed-22920.html,"secrets behind the historic indian sword shamsheer revealed

London: A team of British and Italian scientists have unearthed the mastercraftsmanship behind an ancient Indian sword.

The researchers studied a curved single-edged sword called shamsheer which was probably used in battles. The 75-centimeter-long sword from the Wallace Collection in London was made in India in the late 18th or early 19th century.

The researchers determined that the design of the sword is of Persian origin, from where it spread across Asia and eventually gave rise to a family of similar weapons called scimitars being forged in various Southeast Asian countries.

It was established that the steel used is quite pure. Its high carbon content of at least one percent shows it is made of wootz steel.

This type of crucible steel was historically used in India and Central Asia to make high-quality swords and other prestige objects, the study led by Eliza Barzagli from the University of Florence in Italy, noted.

Its band-like pattern is caused when a mixture of iron and carbon crystalises into cementite.

This forms when craftsmen allow cast pieces of metal (called ingots) to cool down very slowly, before being forged carefully at low temperatures.

The craftsman of this particular sword allowed the blade to cool in the air, rather than plunging it into a liquid of some sort.

Craftsmen often enhanced the characteristic ""watered silk"" pattern of wootz steel by doing micro-etching on the surface.

Through overcleaning some of these original 'watered' surfaces have since been obscured, or removed entirely, Barzagli explained.

Two different approaches were used to examine the shamsheer: the classical one (metallography) and a non-destructive technique (neutron diffraction).

The study was published in the journal Applied Physics A - Materials Science & Processing.

(Alyssa Bereznak/Yahoo Tech)

Fitbit’s rash just won’t go away.



In the wake of new reports that the company’s latest line of fitness trackers is causing skin irritation, Fitbit responded Wednesday afternoon to accusations that it has not adequately addressed the issue.

Their advice: You don’t have to wear the wearable all the time.

A company spokesperson told Re/code that, according to dermatologists Fitbit has consulted, the rashes “are likely from wearing the band too tight; sweat, water, or soap being held against the skin under the device; or from pressure or friction against the skin.” And any sign of a rash will “resolve quickly when users take a break from the device, usually within hours or days.”

This advice isn’t much different from what Fitbit told me when I contacted them about the skin irritation I experienced when I reviewed its latest $130 band, the Fitbit Charge. To be clear, the marks on my arm aren’t from wearing the band too tightly, it’s simply where the irritation spread. I usually wore the Charge loosely enough to slip a finger between my arm and the device. But it’s important to note that sometimes I couldn’t control how close it got to my skin (like when I was sleeping or running).

The problem with their advice, however, is that the whole point of a fitness tracker is that you wear it all the time. It’s designed to track and reward you for your continual steps and sleep. It even includes competitive games among friends to see who can get the most steps in a week. Any couple of hours or days away from the device may seriously interrupt that data collection. And for a company that recalled an entire line of its Force fitness trackers because of rash complaints, saying “it’ll go away” isn’t necessarily a comforting business promise.

On Wednesday morning, ABC7 News in San Francisco reported that it found over 200 instances of skin irritation complaints on social media, some of which have been collected in a now 149-page Google Doc started by one former Fitbit Force user who experienced skin irritation. They interviewed several victims of the Fitbit rash, including yours truly.



Though ABC7 requested lab results from Fitbit to understand what, exactly, might be causing irritation with the Charge, the company has yet to provide them with that information.

83,83,FL-2015-000010-IDN,ISIS could become the pirates of the Mediterranean - Daily Mail,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2959848/Warning-ISIS-pirates-Mediterranean-bring-havoc-European-waters-taking-coastal-towns-Libya.html,"Militias loyal to ISIS could bring Somalia-style piracy to the Mediterranean, officials fear.

Two centuries after the brutal Berber pirates were cowered into submission, the threat of maritime terror in the Med is once again looming from North Africa.

Fighters that have sworn allegiance to the Islamic State have made sweeping new inroads in Libya, and have taken numerous coastal towns, just a few hundred miles across the water from mainland Europe.

Italian officials believe that militants are already working with experienced seamen – the human traffickers shipping tens of thousands of migrants to Europe every month.

Scroll down for video

Terror threat: Officials are worried Islamic State could bring Somali-style piracy to the Mediterranean after threatening to hide militants among the 500,000 refugees it threatened to send to Europe - if they are attacked in Libya

'Psychological attack': If ISIS make good on their threat of sending half a million migrants all at once to Europe, emergency services such as the Italian Coast Guards (pictured off the coast of Sicily) may not be able to cope

Mass emigration: More than 5,000 migrants - including those fleeing the Libya crisis - have arrived in Italy since the start of January alone which is a 59 per cent increase on the same time last year

Death at sea: More than 300 African migrants are believed to have died at sea this week alone, some of which are trying to escape the spread of militancy in Libya

And it is feared they could be close to striking into a bold new business on one of the world's busiest waterways.

Rampant piracy has characterised shipping in the Gulf of Aden between Somalia and Yemen since the civil war in the 1990s plunged the country into lawlessness and clan warfare.

The international community struggled to get to grips with the armed attacks because of the impossibility for Western forces to patrol 2.5 million square miles of ocean with just a few dozen ships.

British couple Paul and Rachel Chandler were captured on their yacht by Somali pirates off the Seychelles in 2009 and held hostage for 388 days before they were ransomed.

Last weekend jihadists in Libya took control of their second urban centre in Sirte, Gaddafi's coastal birthplace and announced they would march on Misrata, Libya's third biggest city.

And footage released by the terrorists of the beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians on a Libyan beach on Sunday showed they were already at the shores of the Mediterranean, just 220 miles south of Italy.

In the video the lead executioner pointed his knife northwards across the waters of the Mediterranean and vowed to 'conquer Rome'.

Extremist propaganda: It emerged yesterday that ISIS threatened to flood Europe with 500,000 migrants from Libya in a 'psychological' attack against the West

Influx of migrants: More than 170,000 migrants arrived in Italy by boat last year and almost 4,000 have been rescued of its coast in the last six days alone

Refugees: Migrants from sub-Saharan Africam Eritrea and those fleeing the violence in Libya yesterday arrived at the military airport in Bresso, Italy

Makeshift homes: Some of the people who have left Africa for Europe will be housed in temporary tents and structures set up by the Red Cross in Bresso

Escaping terror: Islamic State has taken control of massive parts of Libya, forcing many to flee to European countries such as Italy (pictured)

And Italian intelligence suggests that they already have the necessary access and know how to wreak havoc in European waters.

Analysts at the Ministry of defence are 'preparing for every eventuality', a spokesman said.

The fears were backed up by analysis by a leading defence magazine, Rivista Italiana Difesa. A report said: 'Having gained control of some ports and of vessels of various descriptions and with the possibility of taking advantage of the experience accumulated by the people traffickers working the migratory routes for years, ISIS could repeat the scenario that has dominated the maritime region between Somalia and Aden for the last ten years'.

The document went on: 'Speed boats could attack fishing boats, cruise ships, small merchant ships, as well as coast guard in this case more to capture prisoners to exhibit in orange jumpsuits and a knife to the neck (and to ask for lucrative ransoms for them).

'Boats crammed with migrants could also be used in ""kamikaze"" missions,' the experts said, in which ships carrying explosives would be detonated taking with them coast guard boats or other rescue craft.

It emerged yesterday that ISIS threatened to flood Europe with 500,000 migrants from Libya in a 'psychological' attack against the West.

Breaking point: The officials at Lampedusa airport (pictured) are struggling to process the 1,200 newly arrived migrants in a reception centre built for a third of that number - and now Islamic State has threatened to send 500,000 to Europe's shores

Escape: Today, the spread of violence and extremism in Libya has forced thousands to flee to Italy (ferry port of Lampedusa pictured) where officials are struggling to deal with the sudden influx

Dangerous: Egypt's brutal airstrikes on the Libyan village of Derna - in retaliation for the mass murder of 21 of its countrymen - forced many to abandon their homes

Searching for safety: With militancy and violence spreading through Libya, many Egyptians living there are now returning to their home country (pictured on the border village Sallum)

More than 170,000 migrants arrived in Italy by boat last year and almost 4,000 have been rescued of its coast in the last six days alone.

Mediterranean piracy would bring an end to leisure sailing and would strike a blow at the heart of the cruise industry.

It could also drive up the cost of living for Europeans as cargo would increasingly have to travel by rail and road.

The sea is among the world's busiest waterways and accounts for 15 per cent of global shipping activity, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.

And only a small expanse of Egyptian land separates it and the Suez Canal - the artificial waterway connecting Northern African with countries like Somalia and Ethiopia in the east.

Over 17,000 ships - weighing almost one million tonnes - passed through the 101 mile channel in 2014 alone.



In 2009, Libya signed a deal with Italy to stop the flow of illegal immigrants from northern-Africa to its shores. And in return, Italy pledged to pay $5billion over 25 years to the country it colonised for 33 years.

On the second anniversary of the treaty, Gaddafi warned that Europe 'might turn black because of all the illegal immigrants'.

Retaliation: Egypt blitzed ISIS training camps, weapons stockpiles and fighters in two waves of air strikes following the gruesome murder of captured Egyptian workers in a video (above) released on Sunday

Procession: A fleet of cars parade freely through the Libyan city of Benghazi, showing the level of control they exercise in the country ruled almost entirely by rebel forces

Prophecy: In 2009, Libya's leader Muammar Gaddafi signed a deal with Italy to stop the flow of illegal immigrants from northern-Africa to its shores and warned the waters might 'turn black because of illegal immigrants'

If the militants do exploit the new and potentially profitable business opportunity of piracy it could bring in millions to fund new terror.

Middle East and Africa risk consultancy Perim Associatesbelieves the threat of that happening and extremist infiltration of illegal African emigrants to Europe is 'certainly conceivable'.

Its Chief Executive Ethan Chorin said: 'ISIS has been drawing attention by doing very extreme things.

'Ironically, it backs up what Gaddafi promised would happen if the regime fell - there would be pirates in Crete, and on the Italian shore.

ISIS has been drawing attention by doing very extreme things... Ironically, it backs up what Gaddafi promised would happen if the regime fell - there would be pirates in Crete, and on the Italian shore. Libya would become another Somalia. Ethan Chorin, Middle East and Africa Expert

'Libya would become another Somalia. In fact, the only way this would happen is if a series of major blunders was committed, and Libya became a failed state as a result.'

'Groups like AQIM - whose current connections with ISIS are unclear - have allegedly collected over $50million in ransom from the European states for their captured nationals.'

There has also been speculation that Islamic State has been raising money with lucrative drug trading from Latin America and recently.

And this week, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations accused the group of harvesting organs to raise funds.

Mohamed Alhakim urged the UN Security Council to investigate suspected organ harvesting after masses of corpses with surgical incisions and missing kidneys were discovered in shallow graves in Mosul, Northern Iraq.

The new analysis comes days after an Italian coast guard boat carrying out a rescue off the coast of Libya was threatened by four men carrying Kalashnikovs. The gunmen refused to give up their dinghy and fled after handing over the migrants on board.

The industrial scale piracy off the coast of Somalia is the result of long-term instability onshore.

Somalia has been described as the archetype of a failed state, without a functioning central government since the early 1990s and split by an insurgency.

Terror on the water: Somali pirates (pictured attacking the Zhenua 4 in the Gulf of Aden would track the passage of often poorly defended cargo vessels in the major shipping lanes

At the height of attacks by Somali pirates (pictured being apprehended by Royal Marines) up to a dozen or more merchant ships were being held captive at any one time

Only the capital Mogadishu is under the control of the Transitional Government – which has the military backing of neighbouring Ethiopia – and even within the city limits its grip on power is weak.

Piracy in the Gulf of Aden came to the forefront in 2008 – with the hijacking of the Sirius Star, the largest ship ever to fall to such an assault.

Armed pirates track the passage of often poorly defended cargo vessels in the major shipping lanes.

They give chase in high speed skiffs and hold them hostage until a ransom is paid.

Attacks more than doubled in frequency in that year, as pirates used new tactics and weaponry threatening the future of the Suez Canal as a major shipping route.

At the height of Somali pirate attacks in 2011, up to a dozen or more merchant ships were being held captive at any one time, often for multi-million dollar ransoms.

Since then, growing use of private security details and the presence of international warships have largely prevented successful attacks in that area, while boardings have surged in West Africa and off the coasts of Indonesia and Malaysia.

Piracy in the Mediterranean ended in the nineteenth century after the Berber pirates were bombarded in Algiers. International treaties later banned profiteering or legalised government-sanctioned piracy, which was practised by Sir Francis Drake.","Thu, 19 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/19/25D460FC00000578-0-image-a-30_1424346595299.jpg,"['somalia', 'migrants', 'europe', 'piracy', 'state', 'italy', 'mediterranean', 'pirates', 'libya', 'isis', 'coast']",

86,86,FL-2015-000010-IDN,First Look: YT Industries TUES CF - Pinkbike.com,https://m.pinkbike.com/news/first-look-YT-TUES-CF-Pro-2015.html,"

Official YT Press Release:



Das TUES CF – it is done. YT’s flagship downhill bike now in carbon. In April 2015, Forchheim-based bike manufacturer YT Industries will bring a brand new carbon version of its TUES downhill bike to the market. The heir to the much-acclaimed aluminum version is the result of two full years of development effort, and sets a new standard for big bikes. The heart of this speeding bullet is a new carbon frame featuring modern “race” geometry, which when coupled with the proven characteristics of the TUES AL is sure to make waves and turn heads on the trails.



If YT Industries is all about Good Times, the TUES CF is about even Better Times! The latest brainchild of YT’s developers raises the question: an even better version of an already award-winning bike? Hard to imagine, but a reality as of this spring. Two years of development, considerable brain power and engineering skill as well as input from YT athletes such as Andreu Lacondeguy and Cam Zink have all led to the creation of something close to the perfect downhill bike. And now, after getting a first glimpse of the prototype during Crankworx 2014 in Whistler, riders from Europe, USA, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Israel can look forward to the production version, available for purchase directly from the manufacturer of course.



Like its aluminum predecessor, which Andreu Lacondeguy rode to victory at the Red Bull Rampage, the TUES CF features a low center of gravity, extremely agile handling, and great mid-stroke stability and support. It is fast and maneuverable, not only due to the carbon diet which saw the frame drop 1 kg of weight, but also thanks to its modern “race” geometry featuring significantly longer reach. The frame features our award-winning “V4L” suspension system, which provides plush and linear action over rough terrain with just the right amount of progressiveness to deal with the bigger hits. Talking about the development of this DH weapon, “of course we put our heart and soul into this project” said Stefan Willared, Head of Development at YT and father of the TUES CF. “Our goal is always to build the best bike. Like most manufacturers, we receive quite a lot of helpful feedback from our athletes. The big difference is, we take it into consideration too! I am very happy with the result, and I am confident that we have made a bike that will play in the Champions League as well as bring many riders much joy on the trails.”



The standard issue TUES CF COMP is suitable for almost any rider. The suspension components are easy to adjust and already offer great performance out of the box. The bike’s handling is forgiving and confidence-inspiring, yet competitive, for beginners and pros alike. In contrast, the premium CF PRO model is designed for high performance alone. Whether you are ripping laps in the bike park or going big in natural, technical freeride terrain, the TUES CF PRO delivers ultimate fun and performance from the first meter of the trail to the last. The highly sophisticated and fully tunable suspension is recommended for advanced riders with good understanding of bike set-up.



A pro-level ride! What in theory sounds like a “next level bike” can ultimately only be described by the feeling and fun it procures on the trail.

87,87,FL-2015-000010-IDN,The Coastal Challenge in Costa Rica Has a New Champion - The Costa Rica Star,https://news.co.cr/coastal-challenge-costa-rica-new-champion/36932/,"One of the most grueling adventure races in the world is the Coastal Challenge, sometimes known as the Rainforest Run in Costa Rica. The Coastal Challenge is in the category of long-distance trail running, and this Friday the competition wrapped up with an absolute and dominating victory by South African adventure racer Iain Don-Wauchope.

According to Fiorella Masis of national newpaper La Nacion, the South African athlete set a significant record in this race: he completed the rigorous 230 kilometers in 22 hours and 29 minutes, which is more than an hour faster than the record previously held by former champion Mike Wardian.

The Costa Rica Star has reported on past editions of this competition:

In a previous edition of this rugged challenge, the first stage of the race took competitors from Quepos to the Savegre Valley for a distance of nearly 34 kilometers and a total ascent of 850 meters. The next day, runners climbed even higher and later descended to Playa Dominical. From there, they continued to the gorgeous Playa Ventanas, Coronado, Palmar Sur (home of the mysterious Museum of the Stone Spheres), Sierpe, and finally Drake Bay. Event organizers further describe the trails: The course is set along Costa Rica’s tropical Pacific coastline but weaves at times into the Talamancas, a coastal mountain range in the Southwest corner of the country. You’ll finish near the border of Panama in a serene fishing village that until recently was only accessible by boat. Jungle and rainforest trails, mountain trail and single track across ridgelines, highlands and coastal ranges; beaches, rocky outcroppings and reefs, river and estuary crossings, [etc…]

Costa Rican trail runner Ahur Yousseffi came in second in the Coastal Challenge; he trailed Don-Wauchope by about four hours. Notable adventure athlete Veronica Bravo from Chile is the new champion in the Women’s category of the Coastal Challenge, and she is seriously thinking about dedicating herself 100 percent to trail running.","Sat, 07 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.co.cr/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/The-Coastal-Challenge.jpg,"['rica', 'challenge', 'set', 'adventure', 'champion', 'south', 'trail', 'running', 'coastal', 'costa', 'trails']",

89,89,FL-2015-000010-IDN,Thaipusam incident – rhetoric not useful in promoting race relations - The Online Citizen,https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2015/02/10/thaipusam-incident-rhetoric-not-useful-in-promoting-race-relations/,"By Gangasudhan

So we have yet another incident of unrest at Desker Road, when the police were called in to quell a “disturbance” in the peace which, oddly enough, might not have been an issue at all if they had not intervened.

Contrary to the rhetoric on mainstream media, there is ample reason to believe that the scuffle between Thaipusam participants and the police – which thanks to social media we get to see in widely circulated videos – would not have happened if the police had not done anything and allowed the civilians involved to simply play traditional music along the route. Nothing would have been damaged, and – let’s be honest – less eardrums would have burst than at a typical getai.

As it was, we had reports of a policeman getting injured, at least one woman knocked to the ground, and three arrested. But anyone who wishes to wave around this “violence” as a red card to justify the clamp down by the police, is doing little more than throw out the usual red herring.

In this dramatic show-and-tell, one aspect of the incident seems to have been conveniently forgotten – the concerns of the Tamil community on why was there a need to approach participants of the religious procession with such aggression. Let us not be mistaken that attempts to subdue by force and arrest are no less aggressive than the rowdy behavior that the participants were accused of.

Even if the entourage had being uncooperative, shouldn’t the approach be much more subtle given the highly sensitive nature of this ‘highly privileged’ procession that apparently no other religious denomination enjoys? Only in Singapore do you see this type of “protection” for religious freedom.

One Member of Parliament referred to maintaining law and order in spite of traditional celebrations. Another Minister urged everyone to keep calm and carry on keeping calm, evidently directed at the aggrieved community and others who sympathized with the participants involved in this incident. Yet one more Minister clarified that religious processions are so sensitive that they need to be highly restrictive.

Calling all other processions non-religious is just disingenuous because many can be traced back to a religious undertone if one wanted. Likewise, the Thaipusam festival could as easily be reclassified as a cultural procession with a religious ceremony at the start and end points.

It would also be fair to say that there is more religion on show during a funeral march than along the Thaipusam route. It is more sensible to look at the spirit of the event rather than use the vague shield of religious sensitivity just because we have termed something religious. While it is meant to be the demonstration of one’s commitment or penance, the Thaipusam ritual is done largely in a celebratory and extravagant procession, not unlike a lion dance or dragon dance.

If we look at potential physical danger, there is incredible hazard in the bonfires that erupt islandwide during the hungry ghost month. If we look at massive road diversion and inconvenience to residents and businesses, Thaipusam happens once a year for less than 24 hours, while things like the Formula One Grand Prix and various Orchard Road parades cause more heartache to motorists for a longer period each time. If we look at potential noise pollution, can any loud, boisterous music along Serangoon Road compare in any way to the amplified guttural utterances at the auctions of the hungry ghost month, or the weekend festivities of ‘void deck weddings’ in the heartlands?

Simply framing the rhetoric in the aftermath to conveniently focus on the conduct of the entourage in question or its members or even specific individuals will not sit well with a thinking public, who are more than capable of comparing said rhetoric with similar events around them. The logic would be found seriously wanting.

The conclusion among those affected, particularly in the wake of the Little India riot in December 2013, and incidentally within walking distance of the current one, would likely cause deeper rifts within the Indian/Tamil community. If our government leaders think that such rhetoric, including those that call Thaipusam a “special privilege”, would help to ease tensions, then they are gravely mistaken.

The follow-up from the government and the authorities thus far from the Thaipusam incident is frighteningly apathetic and can only further entrench racial and religious fault lines – something it so painfully reminds the entire Republic of Singapore to be mindful of, year in, year out, ad nasuem.","Tue, 10 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",http://13.212.226.79/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/thaipusam-lawrence-photo.jpg,"['relations', 'promoting', 'highly', 'procession', 'road', 'rhetoric', 'incident', 'thaipusam', 'community', 'look', 'participants', 'race', 'religious', 'useful']",

New study shows couples have more children when one half takes control

Equality may not be the best policy – at least when it comes to starting a family.

Research shows couples have more children when one half takes control of the relationship.

And the boom in births applies whether it is the man or the woman in charge. This may be partly because strong women find submissive men sexy, the Czech researchers say.

More than a quarter of women are the dominant partner in a relationship, making the couple stronger

Pairing a dominant personality with a more reserved soul may also make it easier to resolve rows and boost co-operation.

For the study, entitled Why Do Some Women Prefer Submissive Men, the researchers from Charles University in Prague quizzed 240 young men and women about the sort of person they were attracted to.

For instance, they were asked whether they would prefer to be with someone who would 'guide and protect' them or 'admire and serve' them.

They were also asked whether their mother and father had equal status in their relationship or whether one tended to be more submissive. Finally, they were asked how many siblings they had.

The results showed there to be more families in which one parent was dominant than where both were equal.

Women were in charge in 24.2 per cent of cases, the journal Neuroendocrinology Letters reports. The couples in which one partner was dominant had the most children.

The researchers said: 'Too often, we are told to view even mild dominance and submissiveness as a problem.

Our results challenge the frequently held belief in equality within couples as a trademark of functional partnerships.

New research finds couples with one dominant partner, as in Fifty Shades Of Grey, are more successful

'It rather appears that existence of some disparity, with one partner dominant, and the other submissive, improves cohesion, results in better co-operation between partners and improves the couple's ability to face challenges.'

They added: 'In the light of these results, both excessive pressures towards equality in some modern societies, and pressures towards male dominance in some traditional societies, represent a form of oppression.'

Couples made up of two strong characters had the fewest children.","Sun, 08 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/08/257941E600000578-0-image-a-45_1423422788608.jpg,"['submissive', 'couples', 'men', 'dominant', 'women', 'researchers', 'produce', 'results', 'partner', 'asked', 'children', 'happier']",
