1,1,FL-2014-000154-IDN,Asia flooding highlights opportunities for catastrophe bonds and ILS - Artemis.bm,https://www.artemis.bm/news/asia-flooding-highlights-opportunities-for-catastrophe-bonds-and-ils/,"Flood risks across the Asia-Pacific region are receiving an increased focus, as reinsurance and ILS markets look to find new opportunities to put capacity to work. Analysis and developments in risk models clearly show the need for more capacity to target this peril.



Following the unprecedented floods that devastated Thailand for several months in 2011, taking the lives of over 800 people, reinsurance broker and risk specialist Guy Carpenter (GC), has produced a new report focused on the potential of flooding across Asia-Pacific. The new GC report, titled ‘Flood Risk in Asia – A Detailed Study,’ identifies key Asian regions that are vulnerable to flooding similar to that of Thailand, while offering ideas for greater prevention and protection systems.

Michael Owen, Head of GC Analytics, Asia Pacific, commented on the study; “Our intent in publishing this report is to identify the flood potential in Asia so the insurance industry can be better prepared when the next flood occurs. Our findings show that the potential areas at risk are in no way limited to the ones considered. And more importantly, with economic growth and increased wealth of various countries in the region, historic events that did not cause much damage could potentially be catastrophic if they were to happen again.”

The report explains that over a 20-year period (1990-2010) in China, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam, urbanization has increased by more than 50% as communities spread from rural regions.

A significant issue being that the areas many communities move to are particularly prone to floods, emphasizing Owen’s point that low-cost historic events have the potential to become increasingly damaging and high-cost to the Asian economy.

The vulnerability of Asia-Pacific regions to flooding is expected to rise considering the ever-increasing frequency and severity of climate change risks, where flooding is often at the forefront. In a region that is largely underinsured, or uninsured, the opportunity for providing catastrophe risk transfer capacity is ripe and, so to is the opportunity for some of that protection to be via insurance-linked securities (ILS), collateralized reinsurance and catastrophe bonds.

Figures from the World Bank estimates the insured losses of the 2011 Thai floods at roughly $15 billion, with an economic cost estimate of around $45 billion, making it the world’s fifth costliest disaster.

At that magnitude of loss event the need for reinsurance protection is clear, as is the opportunity for alternative capital, ILS and catastrophe bonds to play a role in the future, as models improve and risk transfer needs grow.

Advancements in risk models targeting Asian flood risks are coming thick and fast as well. The latest is an announcement from Aon Benfield’s Impact Forecasting unit which has developed new realistic disaster scenario (RDS) models to estimate the cost of floods in China and Vietnam.

Aon Benfield says that events such as in Thailand have brought the issue of non-modelled perils and territories in Asia to the fore and initially triggered Impact Forecasting’s development of the probabilistic Thailand flood model in 2012. The team has now developed a range of RDS models for various perils to further bridge the coverage gap and offer an immediate solution as a stepping stone for more in-depth probabilistic models to come as part of the firm’s ongoing strategy.

Impact Forecasting has considered the peak exposure zones in emerging economies with growing insurance penetration and where flood hazard will drive the probable maximum loss (PML). As part of this process, models have been developed for:

China: The Pearl River Delta in Guangdong province, one of the most densely urbanised regions in the world and a key economic hub, and the Lower Yangtze River including Shanghai.

Vietnam: Ho Chi Minh City in the South on the River Saigon and Hanoi Province in the North by the Red River.

Adityam Krovvidi, Head of Impact Forecasting for Asia Pacific, said; “Data is at the heart of these models. We’ve gone the extra mile to gather the most comprehensive data on flood hazard and defences through field surveys, liaison with government departments and investment in high quality data – for example digital terrain data at a 5m x 5m resolution in Vietnam. These RDS models are part of a much bigger plan that already includes numerous RDS across a wide range of perils such as earthquake, flood, volcano and riot. While we are in the process of expanding our probabilistic model coverage for the region, the realistic disaster scenarios offer a breadth of Asian coverage.”

Malcolm Steingold, CEO of Aon Benfield, Asia Pacific, commented; “Speed of development is critical. These models are vital to help insurers and reinsurers take advantage of the additional capacity in the market and help transfer flood risks. Notably, this can also provide new opportunities for government schemes to explore how they can further support their people in times of catastrophic events.”

He began growing tomatoes and several other crops on a small scale before expanding his operations – building more greenhouses and hiring one employee.

When the floods struck in 2010, however, Forto found that much of his newfound success had been washed away.

“You realize that what brings bread to the table has been destroyed,” he remembers. “It was really, really difficult. “

Recognizing that immediate assistance and significant resources would be necessary for Sudo Forto, along with countless others who depend on agriculture production for their livelihoods, to rebound quickly in the wake of such a disaster, the World Bank, in coordination with the government, worked to restructure an existing Agriculture and Rural Development Project in order to make funds immediately available to allow victims like Forto to begin the long and arduous task of rebuilding.

“You don’t believe anyone will help,” remembers Forto, “however, we received a lot of support.”

Along with help he received from friends and neighbors, Sudo Forto also received necessary supplies and equipment from the Bank’s project to begin rebuilding. This help came in the form of new greenhouses, irrigation barrels, plastic to cover crops and build greenhouses, and a number of irrigation hoses.

“We were motivated by all the help we received,” recounts Forto, “and we recovered fast – in about a year.”

With the onset of the more recent round of flooding in the region this year, the World Bank Group is again working with its partners in the country to help all those impacted by these floods to recover as quickly as Forto did. In June, a $100 million Floods Emergency Recovery Project was approved for the country, which focuses on the areas most affected by these floods.

These emergency response efforts are also being bolstered by more long-term projects designed to both avoid and mitigate the impacts of future natural disasters, including the Drina Flood Protection Project, designed to improve flood management in the towns of Bijelijna and Goražde.

Collectively, this work is designed to better ensure that floods, landslides, and other natural disasters are averted if and when possible. They are also designed to provide maximum support to victims in the unfortunate event that they do occur.","Wed, 05 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT","https://www.worldbank.org,","['bosnia', 'storm', 'received', 'recovery', 'weathering', 'sudo', 'forto', 'victims', 'greenhouses', 'herzegovina', 'help', 'floods', 'disaster', 'world', 'designed', 'project']", 
3,3,FL-2014-000154-IDN,Culture must be considered in approaches to disaster risk reduction – UN-backed report - UN News Centre,https://news.un.org/en/story/2014/10/482112-culture-must-be-considered-approaches-disaster-risk-reduction-un-backed-report,"The 2014 World Disasters Report, published by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), explores the question of how culture could become a central consideration in disaster risk reduction efforts, and analyses the influence of disasters and risks on culture.

The report was launched today The Event at the Vienna International Centre at an event organized by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), IFRC, the Embassy of Norway in Vienna and the Austrian Red Cross.

A press release from UN Information Service in Vienna, notes that the new report tries to answer the question of what should be done when people blame a flood on an angry goddess, as it was the case when the Koshi River in India flooded huge regions in 2008, while people in Indonesia blamed the mountain god when Mount Merapi erupted in 2010.

Similar beliefs were widespread even in the United States during Hurricane Katrina, when some believed it showed God’s displeasure with some of the behaviours of the people who live in or visit New Orleans.

Acknowledging the fact that hundreds of millions of people live in dangerous places – including the sides of volcanoes, earthquake fault zones and coasts exposed to storms and tsunamis – the report underscores that people’s own priorities often include the need to live in such high-risk environments because that is where they can gain their livelihoods.

Speaking at the event, the Deputy Executive Director of UNODC, Aldo Lale Demoz said: “We need to do more in helping those who have already been victims of disaster to protect themselves from violence, including violence against women and children and organised crime groups trying to exploit them.”

To reduce the risks that people face, it is essential to focus on how livelihoods can be made more robust, safer and, where necessary, be replaced, the report states. Reconciling local health beliefs or everyday practices with public health interventions is also vital, as people’s perceptions of health risks involve local traditions, beliefs and social practices that sometimes do not coincide with the expectations of public health interventions.

Citing the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa as an example, the report stresses the need to address misconceptions and cultural beliefs through effective social mobilization and behavioural change so that efforts to stop such deadly diseases will not be in vain.

Future investments must be channelled towards a more culturally sensitive, human-based approach to disaster risk reduction, as part of the discussions in framing a new post-2015 development agenda, the report concludes.

The mandate of UNODC, whether on drugs, crime or terrorism, has a strong connection to the notion of risk. People risk their health and lives by engaging in drug use, drug trafficking or unsafe migration practices. The reasons for such risk-taking might be very similar to those explained in the report as it relates to disasters. As has been seen in the past, places hit by natural disasters are breeding grounds for crime, violence and corruption.

The report, which has been published annually since 1993, compiles trends, facts and analysis of contemporary catastrophes and their effect on vulnerable populations worldwide.","Tue, 28 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/assets/2014/10/20448/image770x420cropped.jpg,"['health', 'violence', 'reduction', 'crime', 'culture', 'unbacked', 'considered', 'beliefs', 'risk', 'report', 'disasters', 'vienna', 'disaster', 'unodc', 'approaches', 'risks']",

Linkedin Corry Elyda (The Jakarta Post) Jakarta ● Mon, November 3, 2014

Abdullah, a community unit head in Petamburan subdistrict, Central Jakarta, was out of ideas for how to encourage residents to pay more attention to sanitation in the neighborhood.



He claimed that he had repeatedly called on residents to maintain clean homes and areas surrounding their abodes but trash continued to accumulate.



'Some of them have yet to realize that maintaining clean surroundings is partly their responsibility,' he said recently.



Abdullah said his unit had deployed five garbage collectors to 11 neighborhood units. 'However, their job is to only pick up garbage in front of people's houses and dispose of it at a temporary dump site. They do not sweep the alleys or clean the sewers,' he said.



Abdullah said many residents considered garbage collecting and the disposal of it dirty work. 'We even have to hire outsiders [to work] as garbage collectors,' he said.



Abdullah said his community unit, consisting of around 900 families, paid fees ranging from Rp 7,000 (57 US cents) to Rp 10,000 a month to pay garbage collectors.



'We pay them around Rp 800,000 per month. We cannot pay them more as our financial resources are also limited,' he said.



He added that most workers earned additional income from selling recyclable goods such as cardboard boxes and plastic bottles.



According to Abdullah, garbage collectors usually pick up garbage in the morning and transport it to a temporary dump site where garbage trucks then haul it to the Bantar Gebang landfill in Bekasi.



Aside from traffic and flood-related issues, garbage is a problem plaguing Jakarta. Some people place blame on the Sanitation Agency for the dirty city.



Sanitation Agency head Saptastri Ediningtyas said that the chronic problem could not be alleviated without the involvement of residents.



'We are only responsible for making sure that garbage from temporary dump sites is transported to Bantar Gebang and to maintain public facilities like highways, rivers and parks,' she said.



Saptastri said, therefore, that her agency would focus more on educating public on waste management. 'Transporting garbage from residential areas to Bantar Gebang is very costly and inefficient. It is better to educate residents on how to better manage their own garbage,' she said.



The city of 10 million people produces 5,800 to 6,000 tons of garbage per day and pays Rp 114,000 per ton of garbage to be processed at Bantar Gebang. The city allocates Rp 400 billion annually from its budget for waste management.



The agency head said her office would work on developing a waste management education program.



'We will try to find the best way to change people's mindsets and attitude toward garbage with measurable programs,' she said.



Trisakti University urban analyst Nirwono Yoga said that independent waste management was a key to resolving sanitation issues in the city.



'Residential areas, markets, shopping malls, office areas, apartments and hotels should manage their own waste,' he said, adding that if each institution managed their own garbage, the chronic problem could be solved.



Nirwono said, however, that the city administration should support such efforts. According to the analyst, many environmental communities are discouraged from recycling and rather encouraged

to sell it.



'Why doesn't the city administration buy their products? Compost, for example, can be used by the Park and Cemetery Agency,' he said.



Nirwono said more people would manage their waste if they realized that it had economical value.","Mon, 03 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.thejakartapost.com/files/images2/WASTE.jpg,"['play', 'waste', 'agency', 'units', 'gebang', 'management', 'rp', 'garbage', 'community', 'jakarta', 'key', 'residents', 'pay', 'bantar', 'city', 'role']", 
6,6,FL-2014-000154-IDN,Scientists were expecting a big El Niño this year. So where did it go? - Vox,https://www.vox.com/2014/11/8/7177709/el-nino-2014-forecast-weakening,"Back in the spring, a number of experts suggested we could see a strong El Niño in late 2014, perhaps similar to the monster event in 1997-98 that upended weather patterns across the globe. That might mean record temperatures, floods in some areas, droughts in others — a huge deal.

But in the months since, scientists have gotten a surprise: El Niño hasn't been unfolding as expected. In fact, there's a good chance it might not appear at all in 2014.

The odds of El Niño have fallen from 80% in the spring to 58% today

The National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center has dropped the odds of El Niño appearing this winter down to 58 percent (a few months ago, those odds were at 80 percent). And if El Niño does form, forecasters now think it will be a ""weak"" one — not a strong event, as once thought.

It's a notable shift, and scientists are still trying to figure out what, exactly, happened. One possibility is that the Pacific Ocean has been extremely warm all over this year, making it tougher for El Niño to form. (Also, in fairness, NOAA never said a strong El Niño was inevitable, and some scientists had been emphasizing caution about predictions all along — because surprises were inevitable.)

The stakes are quite high: El Niño can be terrible news for some countries (it brings heavy flooding to Peru, for instance) but excellent news for others (an El Niño might bring much-needed rain to drought-ravaged California). So it's worth getting a better sense of what's going on here.

What is El Niño again? And why should I care?

El Niño is a phenomenon that occurs irregularly in the tropical Pacific Ocean every two to seven years and affects weather all around the world.

To understand how it works, we first need to see what the equatorial Pacific Ocean looks like under normal, or ""neutral,"" conditions (which are more or less what we've been getting lately):

1) Neutral conditions in the equatorial Pacific Ocean:

Normally, the tropical Pacific Ocean features strong trade winds that blow from east to west.

As the trade winds blow west, warm water piles up near indonesia

As those trade winds travel west, they bring ocean water with them, which gets heated up by the sun. All that warm water then piles up in the western Pacific. Meanwhile, back east along South America, frigid water deep down in the ocean gets pulled up closer to the surface — cooling the waters around Peru.

End result: During ""neutral"" conditions, sea levels are about half a meter higher in Indonesia than they are in South America. Sea surface temperatures near Indonesia are also about 8°C (or 14.4°F) warmer than near Peru. That gradient difference creates a convective loop in the atmosphere that, in turn, reinforces the trade winds.

Because the Pacific is so vast, this system is a major driving force in the global climate. The large warm pool of water near Indonesia causes the air above it to rise, creating rainfall. And this system shapes the jet streams that guide weather and storms around the world.

So that's what ""neutral"" conditions look like. But every so often, along comes El Niño to disrupt all that:

2) El Niño conditions:

Every few years, for reasons that are still being debated, those Pacific trade winds can get disrupted.

In El Niño, the usual pattern gets disrupted

When that happens, all that warm water that was piled up near Indonesia starts sloshing back toward the east, pulled back down by gravity. What's more, the underwater layer known as the thermocline starts sinking. That means there's less cold water rising up from the deep ocean near South America — so the waters near Peru start warming up.

This all causes sea surface temperatures in the east and central Pacific to start rising and the trade winds to weaken further. What's more, rainfall starts following that warm pool of water as it travels eastward. That's why El Niño is usually associated with drier weather in places like Indonesia and Australia, as well as heavier rains in places like Peru.

Once sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean (namely, the Niño 3.4 region) rise 0.5°C above their historical average for three months in a row, and once atmospheric conditions shift accordingly, scientists typically declare an El Niño.

An El Niño usually has large ripple effects all around the world, though it depends on how strong the El Niño actually is. For example, monsoons in the Indian Ocean can weaken. And the jet stream starts stretching from the Eastern Pacific across the southern United States, bringing rainfall and storms along:

Effects of El Niño in the winter:

In addition, during an El Niño, the warmer tropical waters transfer heat into the atmosphere, which can raise global average surface temperatures. The very strong 1997-98 El Niño, combined with global warming, helped push global temperatures in 1998 to new highs. (The next record came in 2005, after a weaker El Niño.)

Ok, so why are scientists now lowering the odds of El Niño?

Earlier this year, it really did look like a strong El Niño would emerge.

A series of winds that begin in the Indian Ocean — known as the Madden-Julian Oscillation — began blowing eastward, counteracting and weakening those trade winds in the Pacific. That allowed some of that warm water piled up near Indonesia to start sloshing back toward the east.

The unusually warm ocean may have made it harder for a temperature gradient to form

As a result, by June, sea temperatures in the central equatorial Pacific (the Niño 3.4 region) had risen 0.5°C above their historical average. It looked like an El Niño was on the way.

But then… things got messy. Atmospheric conditions over the Pacific Ocean didn't shift as expected. Specifically, scientists weren't seeing the change in atmospheric pressure over both the eastern and western Pacific that you'd expect during an El Niño. (See this blog post from NOAA for a fuller explanation.)

In August, Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told me that the waters in the western Pacific hadn't cooled off as quickly as expected — so we didn't seen the sort of west-to-east temperature gradient that can sustain a strong El Niño.

One possible reason for that? The Pacific Ocean everywhere has been extremely warm all over this year. ""When the ocean surface is warm all over, there's no strong temperature gradient for the atmospheric component to build from,"" writes Angela Fritz of Capital Weather Gang:

The ocean is unusually warm all over

(Ocean temperatures have been getting steadily warmer over time due to global warming, though there's still debate about how a hotter world might affect the strength/frequency of El Niño events.)

Could we still get an El Niño in 2014?

That's possible, though far from certain. The National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center now predicts a 58 percent chance of El Niño by the end of the year — which is still above the long-term average of how often we get El Niño conditions:

That said, the models also suggest that it's unlikely to be a strong El Niño. ""If El Niño does emerge, the forecaster consensus favors a weak event,"" the National Weather Service said.

It's a reminder that there's a lot about El Niño we still don't know

Regardless of the outcome, some experts have warned that the shift in forecasts should be a reminder that there's still a lot about El Niño events we still don't know — particularly how, exactly, these events are triggered.

""Our whole system is set up based on the idea that there's some predictability here,"" William Kessler, an oceanographer at NOAA's Pacific Marine Environment Laboratory, told me back in August. ""Because there's a lot of value in that.""

Farmers might, for instance, decide what to plant based on El Niño forecasts — or governments may decide to take water restrictions. ""That's all predicated on the idea that there's some useful predictability here,"" Kessler said. ""And what this year might be showing is that, in some situations, maybe there isn't.""

Likewise, over at NOAA's El Niño blog, Emily Becker points out that weak El Niño events — as this one is likely to be — seem to be getting harder and harder to forecast in recent years: ""Many scientists think we have seen a shift in low-frequency variability since around the year 2000. These shifts may make ENSO prediction harder for today's state-of-the-art climate models to predict.""

So who benefits from El Niño (or no El Niño)?

It's not quite right to say that El Niño events are ""bad"" or ""good."" They tend to have different impacts in different countries (though it all depends on the strength of the El Niño event):

Some countries get hurt by El Niño: A recent economic study (pdf) from the University of Cambridge found that El Niño tends to hurt economic activity in Australia, Chile, Indonesia, India, Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa.

El Niño can hurt Australia and India but benefit the United States

El Niño has its biggest impact in the Asia and Pacific region. It can cause hot, dry summers in Australia that feature fires and reduced wheat yields. What's more, an El Niño is typically associated with drier, hotter conditions in India, which can hurt the agricultural sector.

A strong El Niño can bring disaster in some areas. Back in 1997, El Niño so dried out Indonesia that it led to huge forest fires whose smoke severely disrupted Singapore. El Niño can also bring heavy rains and destructive flooding to Peru, washing away houses and spreading cholera.

Other countries can benefit from El Niño: But on the flip side, the paper found that El Niño can actually boost the economies in Argentina, Canada, Mexico, and the United States, at least in the short term.

Perhaps most notable, El Niño typically brings wetter winter weather to California and Texas, which are both currently plagued by drought. It is also associated with less tornado activity in the Midwest United States and fewer hurricanes hitting the eastern United States.

Here's a table of all the different impacts that the economists calculated:

Now, climate scientists tend to stress that every El Niño is different, so don't take this as a hard and fast prediction about the impacts. Still, it suggests that El Niño tends to have winners and losers — which means that the same goes for a lack of El Niño.

Through the strategic industrial agreement between these two partners, PT Dirgantara Indonesia will be outfitting these rotorcraft in-country with mission equipment before delivery to the Indonesian Navy. The mission equipment include the Helicopter Long-Range Active Sonar (HELRAS) dipping sonar and torpedo launching system – providing a truly effective mission system for operations from land bases and ships.

The mission capabilities and cost effectiveness of Airbus Helicopters’ AS565 MBe Panther has been further validated by Indonesia’s order for 11 helicopters. The rotorcraft will be used in naval anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions.

“The Panther now becomes one of the world’s most capable light/medium anti-submarine warfare platforms, with an advanced ASW suite and the capability to operate from corvettes or small frigates,” said Philippe Monteux, head of region South East Asia and Pacific at Airbus Helicopters. “This fully-capable, modern solution meets the naval requirements of Indonesia and other countries in the region, benefitting from our partnership with PT Dirgantara Indonesia and the industry’s best system suppliers.”

This order will add to the Indonesian Armed Forces’ fleet of Airbus Helicopters rotorcraft serving the country’s defense on land, at sea and in the air. The fleet includes the light EC120 Colibris for training; the Fennecs and BO-105 for light attack missions; the Panthers for anti-submarine warfare missions; and the Pumas and Super Pumas operated by the Air Force who will soon also receive the EC725 for combat search and rescue missions.

The agreements were secured by PT Dirgantara Indonesia as a result of its long-standing cooperation and strategic alliance with Airbus Helicopters. The president of PT Dirgantara Indonesia, Budi Santoso explained, “This latest contract demonstrates the strength and efficiency of our commercial and industrial partnership with Airbus Helicopters. Together, we are able to identify and deliver the most modern and cost-effective solutions for the Indonesian Government and at the same time associate the significant involvement of the Indonesian industry.”","Wed, 05 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://assets.verticalmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/158910605136312.jpg,"['system', 'airbus', 'indonesian', 'indonesia', 'mission', 'helicopters', 'dirgantara', 'warfare', 'as565', 'pt', 'orders', '11', 'panthers', 'rotorcraft']",

Some more than a half-mile wide, they looked like pillars holding up the sky. That week the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency detected 143 new wildfires in Riau Province, the area beneath my flight. All of the fires were almost certainly related to deforestation for timber operations and agriculture—predominantly oil palm cultivation.

Palm oil—which appears in a dizzying amount of food and cosmetic products and is a feedstock for biofuel—poses many environmental problems. It’s the largest driver of Indonesian deforestation, which destroys habitat and contributes to climate change. And ponds of wastewater at palm oil refineries release immense amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas 34 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

Solutions to the environmental problems posed by palm production are complicated, partly because palm oil’s ubiquity, but also because alternatives lack many of the benefits of the versatile oil. But they are out there.

Burning below

A few days after I arrived in Riau, as I marched to the jungle to see one of the fires, I looked back at where my footprints sank some 12 inches into the peat and saw smoke rising from my tracks.

It’s here, in the peat burning below the forests, where the greatest climate impact from palm production can be seen. When forests are cleared to make way for oil palm plantations, the area is usually burned, and most of Riau’s massive fires burn on peat—swampy layers of partially decayed vegetation that spreads up to 60 feet deep beneath most of the province’s forests.

Peatlands hold up to 28 times as much carbon as rainforests growing on mineral soil. The peat is so carbon rich that if it is buried long enough, say for a million years or so, pressure, time and heat will turn it into coal. A single hectare of peatland rainforest can release 6,000 metric tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide when it’s converted into a plantation. Researchers estimated that in 2012 nearly 70% of the carbon released during the transformation of Sumatran rainforests into palm plantations came from peatlands, a 75% increase over their portion of emissions in the 1990s and an indication that palm is increasingly expanding into peat.

And it’s not just CO 2 : In 2013 the nation’s then president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, apologized to Singapore and Malaysia for the brown cloud from Sumatran fires that shattered air pollution records in the neighboring nations, filled hospitals with tens of thousands of smoke-sickened patients and forced officials to close schools. Indonesian aircraft seeded clouds above the fires with 100 tons of salt in hopes of bringing rain to drench fires smoldering in the peat.

When the forests ignited again six months later, more than 9,000 tweets bombarded the president’s office. During an emergency trip to Riau he said he was “ashamed” of the fires. Nearly 50,000 Sumatrans sought treatment for the impacts of smoke on their lungs, eyes and skin. Aircraft again seeded the clouds.

The fires burn thousands of Indonesians out of their homes and destroy the habitat of endangered elephants, rhinos, tigers and orangutans. A United Nations report warned that no wild orangutans may exist outside protected areas by 2020. And at the current rate of habitat destruction, the International Union for Conservation of Nature estimated the Sumatran elephant could be extinct within 30 years.

“Effective action on the ground should be taken immediately to protect Sumatran elephants from extinction,” a report from the IUCN urged in 2013. “Especially in Riau.”

Getting serious

In the past, Indonesia and the world paid lip service to stopping the palm oil industry’s destruction of Indonesian forests and warming of the global climate, but more recently they have appeared to get serious.

In 2010 Norway promised $1 billion to Indonesia to keep its forests standing, and the next year Yudhoyono pledged that by 2020, with international assistance, the nation would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 41% from its “business-as-usual” trajectory. Last August, Singapore began imposing fines of up to $2 million on local and foreign companies that contribute to the haze from fires. The following month, Indonesia, after years of stalling, became the last of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to ratify a treaty intended to reduce the smoke that has become a perennial strain on its relations with its Southeast Asian neighbors. Shortly afterward, at the UN Climate Summit in New York, 150 companies—including McDonalds, Nestlé, and Procter and Gamble—pledged to cut deforestation worldwide in half by 2020 and to eliminate it altogether by 2030.

Then, within days of taking office last October, Indonesia’s new president, Joko Widodo, proposed merging the country’s Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Forestry. That reform could help the nation meet its ambitious forest protection and emissions reductions goals if the Ministry of Environment, which negotiates with the UN and determines how the nation will meet its emissions goals, gains some authority over the nation’s forests and peatlands. On the other hand, the powerful and territorial Ministry of Forestry could usurp some of the Ministry of Environment’s authority.

“Combining exploitation and conservation authorities into one body does not guarantee balanced decision making,” Greenpeace Indonesia chairman Longgena Ginting told the Jakarta Post.

Palm oil boom

Ultimately, however, laws, treaties, government agencies and incentives will have little impact without fundamental changes to how palm oil is produced and consumed. And unfortunately, there are few viable alternatives to palm.

“There are benefits to palm oil which cannot be ignored,” Alan Townsend, dean of the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University, told me before I traveled to Indonesia. “Palm is one of the most productive crops on the planet, with the ability to grow in a remarkable range of places. Couple that with large profit margins, an incredible diversity of uses for palm oil and a lack of economically competitive substitutes, and you can quickly see why the industry has grown so rapidly.”

In 2013 the world consumed 55 million metric tons of palm oil, nearly four times what it used 20 years earlier. Indonesia and Malaysia satisfy 85% of the demand for the world’s most popular food oil. In 1985, Indonesia had less than 2,500 square miles of palm oil plantations. Twenty years later, they covered 21,621 square miles, and by 2025 the Indonesian government projects plantations will cover at least 100,000 square miles.

A month before my arrival in Riau a paper in the journal Nature Climate Change reported that in 2012 Indonesia deforested nearly twice as much land as Brazil, which until recently was destroying its forests faster than any other nation.

In 2013 the world consumed 55 million metric tons of palm oil, nearly four times what it used 20 years earlier.

The exponential growth of palm oil plantations is to a large degree an unintended consequence of economics and food and energy policies elsewhere in the world.

In 2006 US food labels, under mandate from the Food and Drug Administration, began listing “trans fats” because they increase risk of heart disease. That led to a rapid increase in the use of tropical oils that aren’t trans fats, particularly palm. The television physician Dr. Oz promoted palm oil’s benefits to the heart and brain, helping drive a sixfold increase in consumption in the United States since 2000.

In Europe, efforts to avoid genetically modified foods pushed palm, which is so bountiful it hasn’t yet drawn much interest from genetic tinkerers. In China and India, the growing middle classes’ hunger for high-grade food oils can currently be satisfied only by palm.

The boom is fueled by what we drive, too. The increasing interest in biofuels is replacing the environmental damage associated with crude oil with the devastation palm production inflicts on tropical forests and the climate.

“There presently aren’t great alternatives to palm oil.” — Rhett Butler

Some of the consequences of palm oil production, including deforestation and habitat destruction, have led to consumer boycotts. But such actions increase the demand for oil crops that are even more destructive to forests and the climate.

“There presently aren’t great alternatives to palm oil,” Rhett Butler, the founder of the rainforest reporting and research site Mongabay, wrote in an email. “If the goal is to meet growing global demand for edible oils, palm oil provides the most oil volume for a given patch of land. If one were to instead grow coconut or rapeseed, more land would be required to produce the same amount of oil.”

Promising alternative

As demand for alternatives grows, however, that could change. In fact, one promising alternative oil to palm requires no land at all.

Solazyme, a California company, uses microalgae to produce oils for biodiesel that have already powered United Airlines jets and US Navy ships. It’s expanded into oils for soaps, cosmetics and foods, which have higher profit margins than fuels. Last year consumer products powerhouse Unilever announced plans to use 3 million gallons of Solazyme’s algal oil instead of palm in an effort to lower its environmental impact.

“Think beer,” Jill Kauffman Johnson, the company’s director of sustainability, says, describing the vats in which Solazyme grows its algae. “A plant in Illinois is actually in a former Pabst Blue Ribbon plant.”

The microalgae’s versatility makes them a good competitor with palm as a source of oil.

“We can make a heart-healthy high oleic oil. The next day you put in a different strain and you can produce a sustainable alternative to palm or palm kernel oil,” she says. “It’s got the lowest level of polyunsaturated fats of any oil on the market, no trans fats and (grows) in a matter of days, not months in the field.”

The microalgae’s versatility makes them a good competitor with palm as a source of oil.

“Our goal is to try and help alleviate the pressure on the equatorial tropics,” Kauffman Johnson says. Since Solazyme’s algae grow wherever the company places its tanks, Solazyme can site its plants where they are most convenient to customers, partners and feedstocks, thus shortening supply chains. Cellulosic feeds such as switchgrass also minimize environmental impacts. The company just opened a 100,000-metric-ton plant in Brazil that uses sugarcane.

“Our technology is capable of ramping up very quickly,” Kauffman Johnson says.

Nonetheless, consumer tastes and agricultural economics are slow to embrace algae-based oils, so it will likely take years for these oils to replace more than a few drops in the flood of palm oil.

Doing palm better

A more immediate solution, Butler says, is cleaning up the palm industry.

“Establishing policies and best practices that avoid conversion of forests is something that companies can get behind,” he says. “There has been a groundswell of zero-deforestation commitments from buyers and producers in recent months.”

Philip Taylor, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Colorado’s Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research who works with Townsend and has done extensive research in the tropics, says most palm plantations don’t produce the yields they are capable of.

“There are big gaps between what’s being achieved and what’s possible,” he says. “Right now the average yield in Malaysia and Indonesia is 18 ½ tons of fresh fruit bunches per hectare. In places with the best management practices, they’re already getting 30 tons per hectare.”

Yields of palm fruit, Taylor notes, have been stagnant since 1975, while in that same time, soy productivity has improved almost 100%.

“Some of it is knowledge based,” he says. “The right seeds in the right places, the right fertilizer at the right time.”

Incentivizing the transfer of productivity-boosting knowledge among palm producers could make each hectare of plantation as productive as possible. But the Union of Concerned Scientists, in its report “Recipes for Success,“ notes that the increased profits that accompany improved yields can spur further expansion of plantations. Additionally, researchers from the UK and Singapore noted in a recent essay in the journal Science that increased yields and palm crops more suitable for growing in difficult conditions could lead to more land in Africa and Latin America being devoted to palm—both of which have yet to see the explosive planting of palm that has occurred in Southeast Asia. Therefore, improved yields must be accompanied by stricter protections of forests. Indonesia has had a ban on deforestation since 2011, but it’s riddled with loopholes. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil started certifying palm oil that met environmental standards 10 years ago, but many of its members continued to cut down forests. Last summer’s promises to stop the destruction of forests from government, palm producers and companies that use the oil show those efforts are strengthening.

“You have to have a moratorium on deforestation,” Taylor says, noting that the recent commitments by companies like Wilmar and Golden Agri to end deforestation is a significant step in the right direction. “These guys are a huge share of the palm industry,” he says.

If all of the more than 1,000 palm oil refineries worldwide turned their methane into electricity, it would reduce the climate impacts of the operations 34-fold.

At the other end of the production chain, Taylor pointed to more low-hanging fruit for reducing palm oil’s environmental toll. Taylor’s and Townsend’s research shows that the methane released from palm oil refineries accounts for more than one-third of the palm industry’s impact on the climate, and a single pond of palm refinery wastewater annually puts out climate-warming gases equivalent to 22,000 cars. That methane could be used to make electricity by simply covering the pond and placing a biogas generator beside it. If all of the more than 1,000 palm oil refineries worldwide turned their methane into electricity, it would reduce the climate impacts of the operations 34-fold. Yet only 5% of the facilities do so.

In Indonesia, palm mills and refineries already generate their own electricity by burning the fruit’s solid waste. They’re usually far from the grid, and lack policies and infrastructures to feed the electricity into it. But they could send power to nearby villages.

“That’s being done by New Britain Palm and Musim Mas,” Taylor says.

Indonesia’s Sustainable Palm Oil initiative requires palm operations to begin developing biogas capture, which should speed more companies’ adoption of the technology.

And the hundreds of vehicles involved in the nation’s palm supply chain could burn liquefied natural gas—a transportation fuel that’s seeing rapid development elsewhere in Asia. In Riau Province, I passed neither a road nor an hour that wasn’t filled with bright yellow trucks loaded with scarlet bunches of palm fruit. All of those vehicles could run on a cheap and readily available fuel that would provide additional income to palm processors and mitigate their climate impacts.

“It’s going to happen in the next couple of years,” Taylor says.

But the coming years will also bring an increasingly ravenous hunger for palm oil. One producer, Asian Plantations, estimates that global demand for edible oils will more than quadruple by 2050. Palm will supply nearly 60% of that demand.

So perhaps the most important development in the search for palm oil alternatives is the sense of urgency.

10,10,FL-2014-000154-IDN,Threat to rivers as hydropower gets set for global boom - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/threat-rivers-hydropower-gets-set-global-boom/,"Hydropower, the renewable technology that sets gravity to work and harnesses the energy of rivers, is about to double its output.

The growth will be mostly in the developing world − but the construction of new dams on rivers in South America, South-east Asia and Africa comes at a cost. Around a fifth of the world’s largest remaining free-flowing rivers will be dammed, which presents yet another threat to the wild things that live in or depend on wild water.

Christiane Zarfl − now assistant professor for Environmental System Analysis at the University of Tübingen, Germany − and former colleagues at the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries in Berlin presented their findings at the International Alliance of Research Universities congress on global challenges, hosted by the University of Copenhagen. The research is also published in the journal Aquatic Sciences.

“ But while some national economies look for a brighter electric future from hydropower, others have to confront and come to terms with the capriciousness of freshwater delivery

Renewables, such as solar energy and wind power, now provide about a fifth of the world’s electricity production, and hydroelectric power makes up four-fifths of that. The researchers believe that, within the next two decades, another 3,700 dams may more than double hydropower’s total electricity capacity to 1,700 GW.

Surge of activity

China will remain the global leader, but because of the surge of activity in other countries, its share will fall from 31 per cent to about 25 per cent. The largest number of new dams in South America will be in the Amazon and La Plata basins of Brazil. In Asia, the biggest effort will be in the Ganges-Brahmaputra basin and along the Yangtze.

But while some national economies look for a brighter electric future from hydropower, others have to confront and come to terms with the capriciousness of freshwater delivery.

Professor Jim Hall, Director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford, and colleagues argue in Science magazine that too much water − as well as too little – can seriously damage a nation’s economic health. And climate change means that this unpredictability is likely to present even greater difficulties in the decades ahead.

But challenges exist already. In Ethiopia, a sustained drought has reduced economic growth by 38 per cent. In Thailand, floods in 2011 cost the country $16 billion in insured losses and $43 billion in overall economic losses. In parts of India, half the annual rainfall splashes onto the dusty soils in just 15 days, and 90 per cent of the annual river flows are concentrated into about four months of the year.

Rainfall can vary according to season and from year to year. Climate scientists have also repeatedly warned of a possible increase in extremes of heat and flood. So there are at least three dimensions to the delivery of water on tap.

In the arid regions – and these include most of Australia, the southwestern US, the Middle East and North Africa – conditions are marked by what hydrologists call “strong interannual variability”, which is a delicate way of saying that droughts can last for years and then end suddenly with catastrophic flash floods.

“When these dimensions are combined,” the report’s authors say, “the situation is most challenging – a wicked combination of hydrology that confronts the world’s poorest people.”","Wed, 29 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://eco-business.imgix.net/uploads/ebmedia/fileuploads/shutterstock_184242314_dam_japan.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,"['university', 'water', 'set', 'gets', 'hydropower', 'worlds', 'dams', 'wild', 'economic', 'cent', 'freshwater', 'boom', 'threat', 'rivers', 'global']", 
11,11,FL-2014-000154-IDN,Is social media responsible for your safety during a disaster? - The Conversation AU,https://theconversation.com/is-social-media-responsible-for-your-safety-during-a-disaster-33138,"Given the popularity of Facebook and Twitter, it’s not surprising so many people use social media in crises such as floods, fires and earthquakes.

Facebook has introduced Safety Check, a new tool for users in disaster-affected areas to notify their network of “friends” of their safety and check on their family and friends.

Facebook will send a notification to users who may be affected by a disaster, based on the location in their profile and geolocation data collected by apps.

People can then confirm they are safe or report that they are outside of the affected area. When a user confirms they are safe, Facebook will post this on their timeline and notify their friends.

This service from Facebook follows similar moves by other internet companies to become more proactive in crisis communications.

Twitter Alerts allows pre-approved law enforcement, emergency management and government agencies, as well as selected NGOs to send important messages to their followers via push notifications and text messages.

Google has also developed tools to streamline official communication from emergency responders to the public during disasters.

Social media in disasters

Sites such as Facebook and Twitter have become key sources that people turn to for help and information in natural disasters. Our experience in recent disasters, including the 2010-11 Queensland floods and 2013 Tasmanian bushfires, is proof of this.

Emergency management organisations often stress the importance of emergency preparedness for people who live in places that are prone to natural disasters.

But while social media can be a handy resource in crises, people must be careful not to take their access for granted during emergencies. Floods, fires and earthquakes often disrupt the power and communications infrastructures that smartphones rely upon.

Granted, internet companies such as Facebook and Google are keenly aware of this problem and are working to provide internet access remotely through arrays of unmanned drones, stratospheric balloons and satellites.

But for the time being, our access is constrained by the limitations of copper, fibre, hybrid and cellular internet technologies, and their vulnerability to the elements.

New media, new concerns

In a crisis, it is critically important that governments are able to communicate information to citizens that is both accurate and up to date.

With traditional systems, such as radio and television, this is a relatively simple process — emergency management organisations cooperate with media producers to ensure that the information broadcast is current and correct.

This is a more challenging process with new media platforms, because of the different ways that users share information. While traditional media would stop broadcasting any outdated information, social media posts can still be shared well after their accuracy has expired.

Some research has suggested that users have been able to police each other’s social media and hashtag usage during disasters.

But the cost of failure — whether it is the sharing of false or outdated information — can be tragic if it results in a diversion of resources from where they are truly needed.

Facebook’s lack of transparency makes it difficult to know how its social algorithms are geared to facilitate accurate communication in times of crisis.

As tempting as it may be to trust Facebook’s service, we do not know if posts from users in emergency zones are treated any differently by its algorithm than posts about ice bucket challenges or Kardashians, or how widely-read a user’s call for help might be.

There may also be legal ramifications if a platform’s algorithms favour posts that are outdated or misleading. Courts in Australia and Germany have held Google responsible for defamation. Will platforms that engage in crisis communications also be liable for their technological failings?

If Facebook aims to become a go-to service for its users during natural disasters, the effectiveness of its algorithms must be a key concern.

Trial by fire?

So while we’re yet to see how Safety Check works in action, some of its features seem potentially problematic.

Safety Check doesn’t seem to allow users to report themselves as unsafe, only that they are safe or outside of the affected area.

At first blush, this bears resemblance to the social media guides of emergency management organisations, emphasising more traditional communication methods where there is immediate danger.

It also helps position Facebook in a way that minimises its users’ expectations of Facebook’s role as an emergency service provider.

The system also has a basic, on/ off-style understanding of safety. The design of the system might be focused around the types of disasters that Facebook’s developers see more of, such as earthquakes, where safety can often be quickly and easily established after a tremor or series of tremors.

Fires, floods and cyclones, on the other hand, can be long and unpredictable events. Floods can last over a number of days or weeks, or in the case of bush fires and cyclones, their path may change as the disaster evolves.

This raises questions about how and when Facebook will disseminate safety notifications. If a bushfire is occurring near a major population, for example, at what point do users in the affected area receive a notification?

Safety Check’s main problem is that in spite of its celebrated launch, it seems to be a hobby-style project for Facebook — as the tool was designed at a “hackathon”, not in consultation with any emergency management organisations.

In spite of our concerns, it is encouraging to see an organisation such as Facebook taking responsibility for its users and entering the crisis communication space.

A tool that helps family and friends during a crisis, and facilitates easy communication is a welcome development.","Sun, 09 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/63263/original/3yhsm3wh-1414635448.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C183%2C1024%2C496&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['facebook', 'management', 'information', 'responsible', 'emergency', 'users', 'safety', 'media', 'crisis', 'floods', 'disaster', 'social']", 
12,12,FL-2014-000154-IDN,Property: Nappa Merrie lease offer reflects changing northern market fortunes - Beef Central,https://www.beefcentral.com/property/property-nappa-merrie-lease-offer-reflects-changing-northern-market-fortunes/,"A RECENT decision by S. Kidman & Co not to renew its sub-lease on highly-regarded Channel Country grass finishing property, Nappa Merrie, reflects the changing dynamics being seen in northern Australia’s cattle industry.

A resurgent live export sector this year (a record 1.13 million Australian cattle were exported in 2013-14), and the strong prospect of China joining Australia’s livex customer-base in the near future, appears to be diverting some younger, lighter cattle that would under other circumstances be grown-out to bullock weights on Channel Country holdings like Nappa Merrie, into other markets.

Secondly, the reduction in herd size in northern Australia due to drought may also be impacting on immediate demand for finishing country.

S. Kidman recently reported its 2013-14 herd size back 15pc this year, to 182,000 head. In May, the Australian Agricultural Co reported an 86,000-head herd reduction due to drought, while North Australian Pastoral Co also recorded an appreciable herd size reduction, back to 188,000 head.

Located on Cooper Creek in the Channels, 7212 sq km Nappa Merrie is regarded as one of Queensland’s ‘dress circle’ large-scale grass finishing properties, capable of running 12,000 grower steers in a decent season.

Kidman sub-leased Nappa Merrie for eight years in 2007, from primary lessee, Doce Pty Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of gas miner, Santos. Prior to that, the property had a long and productive history as a ‘grass feedlot’ bullock finishing depot as part of Stanbroke Pastoral Co, ending in 2006.

Kidman chief executive, Greg Campbell, confirmed that his company had decided not to extend its current sub-lease arrangement on Nappa Merrie, due to expire in January.

The company has been using the property as a steer fattening depot for cattle bred on other company properties in northern Australia.

“Through the turbulence of the recent live export trade years, Nappa Merrie provided a value-add option, allowing us to access eastern states meatworks with a fat animal,” Mr Campbell said.

“Over the past twelve months though, the live export trade has firmly re-established at good prices – not just into Indonesia, but also into a range of other markets, particularly Vietnam.”

“In addition, AA Co has built a substantial new meatworks in Darwin and from the end of the first quarter of 2015, should be at full-swing and sourcing northern cattle,” he said.

As a result, Kidman now had ‘much-improved’ market outlets in the north and no longer required the ‘extra’ channel country fattening capacity offered through Nappa Merrie. The company continues to own and operate other nearby Channel Country finishing properties including Morney Plains, Durham Downs, Naryilco, Glengyle and Durrie.

Kidman staff at Nappa Merrie, led by manager, Peter Degoumois, are presently busy destocking the property, with steers variously going direct to slaughter, to feedlots, to live export and some transferring to other Kidman properties.

“With it being so dry in the south-west, our transfer options are fairly limited and all our properties in the Channel Country have been prudently selling their herds down,” Mr Campbell said.

The lessee of Nappa Merrie, Doce Pty Ltd, had been given good notice of Kidman’s decision not to continue, he said.

Located about 300km west of Thargomindah, Nappa Merrie is around 720,000ha comprising flood-out country on Cooper Creek, running back to pebbly Mitchell Grass downs. It will safely carry 12,000 mixed-age steers in a decent season and is well-watered by bores, dams, permanent and semi-permanent water holes.","Mon, 10 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.beefcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Boar-Trip-014-300x180.jpg,"['property', 'properties', 'offer', 'country', 'finishing', 'live', 'nappa', 'lease', 'merrie', 'northern', 'cattle', 'reflects', 'fortunes', 'changing', 'channel', 'market']", 
13,13,FL-2014-000154-IDN,Xi Jinping Aims to Propel China to the Top of the World Order - TIME,https://time.com/3560466/xi-jinpings-power-of-one/,"The Oct. 27 profile of China’s leader Xi Jinping in the Shanghai Observer didn’t stint on praise. Readers of the dispatch, published by an online daily partly owned by a local chapter of the ruling Communist Party, learned that the 61-year-old President rises before dawn and toils late into the night. He is “bold and down-to-earth,” and “his work style is very rigorous, and his rhythm is very fast.” Within the space of a few hours, the writer revealed, Xi dealt with the Presidents of both Indonesia and Tanzania with grace and charm–a foreign policy natural. “Everyone present nodded in praise” at the Chinese President’s words, the profile said. A single humanizing touch was added: “Of course, like the average Chinese person,” the Shanghai Observer noted, “Xi Jinping’s busy day is not without humor and joy.”

Since taking office in November 2012, Xi has consolidated power more rapidly than any other Chinese leader in decades–all, if the Shanghai Observer is to be believed, without misplacing his sense of fun. It is not too early to suggest that Xi will be China’s most consequential leader since Deng Xiaoping, the architect of the nation’s economic reforms. As the nation’s President, military chief and, most important, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi has upended the notion that the People’s Republic is ruled by a leadership collective. “In just two years, Xi Jinping has made himself into a strongman,” says Willy Lam, an expert on elite Chinese politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “He has totally exceeded expectations.” The headline of an Oct. 21 online post in the People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s mouthpiece, captured Xi’s place in history: “Mao Zedong made Chinese people stand up; Deng Xiaoping made Chinese people rich; Xi Jinping will make Chinese people strong.”

It is with an ascendant Xi that U.S. President Barack Obama–fresh from disappointing midterm elections in the autumn of his presidency–will meet this month at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Beijing. The Nov. 10–12 forum will be the pair’s first meaningful encounter since a confab at a California ranch last year, when Xi reiterated the need for “a new kind of major power relations” between the world’s two biggest economies.

The gathering in Beijing will be the Chinese leader’s big show, and the regime has used its authoritarian muscle to ensure a flawless event. To guarantee blue skies in the notoriously smoggy capital, factories have been idled and Beijing residents ordered to halt their work commutes. Waiters have been trained in exactly 484 steps to ensure that more than 73,000 guests receive their food within six minutes of its preparation. A perfect place setting has a purpose, and this one is no different: At APEC, Xi is expected to lobby a skeptical international audience for changes in the global financial architecture to give the East greater prominence. “He wants a new financial order,” says Lam, “with the Asia-Pacific and China at the center.”

A Man Apart

Like the surging nation he leads, Xi (pronounced Shee) radiates pride and ambition. His mantra, plastered on billboards nationwide, is “Chinese dream”–an amorphous catchphrase that encompasses an individual striving for personal riches and a collective campaign to restore the country to its rightful position atop the international order. “As Xi maneuvers to place China at the center of the world,” says Jerry Hendrix, a retired U.S. Navy captain and Asia analyst, “he is simultaneously moving to place himself at the center of China at a personal level unseen since Mao and Deng.”

Given how Mao-mania led to the Cultural Revolution and other horrors, China might be wary of personality cults. For decades since, the Communist Party has encouraged consensus building within its top ranks to avoid any one man’s capriciousness from holding sway. But Xi, the son of a party revolutionary, has proved a canny populist after a decade of the colorless regime of former President Hu Jintao. To garner public support, Xi lards his speeches with any number of rousing refrains: jingoist rhetoric, Marxist slogans and even Confucian quotations that could have landed the literati in jail during Mao’s era because of the Chairman’s notorious allergy to ancient wisdom. “We will never blindly copy the experience of other countries,” Xi said in an August speech, “let alone absorb bad things from them.”

Whereas his predecessor Hu faded into the background–a pale apparatchik surrounded by other gray-faced functionaries–Xi has bluntly asserted his authority. Rather than divvy up responsibility among the seven members of the ruling Politburo Standing Committee, Xi has taken direct command of influential committees, some newly formed, on national security, censorship, the Internet, military restructuring, foreign policy and economic reform.

Xi symbolizes a nation projecting greatness, but his homeland is struggling with slowing growth: the economy expanded by 7.3% in the third quarter, the slowest uptick in five years. A widening income gap, crippling corruption and environmental woes have led to dissatisfaction even from those who have benefited most from the greatest economic expansion of all time. Xi must wean China off an overdependence on exports and investment–and move the nation up the economic ladder by encouraging innovation and services. “At this critical moment of great changes and transitions, China is in dire need of a political leader who has the courage, sense of mission and wisdom to lead the country to its reawakening,” declared an August op-ed carried online by the China Daily, the party’s official English-language messenger, before naming Xi the man for the job. “All of Xi’s ideas and actions on cultural, military, political and economical reforms are meant to push China further along the road to rejuvenation.”

Born to Rule

If Xi carries a sense of manifest destiny about his homeland, his personal trajectory seems equally preordained. The son of Xi Zhongxun, a communist guerrilla who fought alongside Mao, he was sent to the countryside to atone for his elite background after his father fell victim to a leadership purge in the 1960s. Like the local villagers, the younger Xi lived in a cave in rural Shaanxi province, for seven years. “Life [at] the grassroots can strengthen your mind,” Xi recalled of the manual labor, fleabites and blisters in a 2005 interview with local TV. “Since then, no matter what kind of difficulties I encounter, as soon as I remember these experiences, I regain courage.”

As the tumult of Mao’s political upheavals dissipated, Xi slid back into city life, studying chemical engineering at the elite Tsinghua University and rising through party ranks in coastal areas profiting from market reforms. (His father was also rehabilitated and later championed economic experimentation and liberal politics.) Xi eventually married an alluring singer famed for her renditions of military tunes. Unlike other recent First Ladies who were rarely photographed in public, Peng Liyuan has traveled by her husband’s side on foreign trips, invariably outfitted in stylish Chinese labels. The couple sent their daughter to Harvard University–perhaps the true Chinese dream.

Yet this revolutionary princeling, as scions of party royalty are called, has also cultivated a common-man image. Since taking office, Xi has emerged from behind the vermilion walls of the Beijing leadership compound to stroll the capital’s alleyways and chow down on steamed buns. In a nation where officials are used to employing bag men, Xi pointedly carries his own accessories in some photo ops. (A picture of the President clutching his own umbrella, his pant legs rolled up to avoid a downpour, won China’s top photojournalism prize this year, even though the image was hardly artistically exceptional.) The carefully constructed persona–candid and approachable, despite the helmet of perfectly parted and dyed hair–even has a name: Xi Dada, or Uncle Xi. “This nickname makes him more like a man of the people,” says Pan Yuhang, an environmental-science major at Beijing Normal University, who held aloft a handmade sign welcoming Xi Dada to the campus in September.

Xi has so far declined unscripted interviews with major, independent foreign media. But he has promoted policies that are particularly popular among the 700 million or so Chinese who have attained or are striving for middle-class status. He has launched–and, more impressively, intensified–an antigraft campaign that has netted nearly 75,000 cadres in a country where endemic corruption has shredded the party’s reputation. (It hasn’t gone unnoticed that the crusade has also felled some of Xi’s presumed political rivals.) In a country experiencing the most frenzied urbanization in world history, he has vowed to simplify the paperwork people need to move from farms to cities. He has also pledged to loosen long-hated family-planning restrictions so that China can better prepare itself for a future filled with too few youths taking care of too many elderly. “Xi Jinping is the emperor of the bourgeoisie because it’s the emerging middle class that matters most in China these days,” says Kerry Brown, a former British diplomat who now heads the China Studies Center at the University of Sydney.

Given the middle class’s fondness for private enterprise, property and other capitalist notions, it’s become harder to justify communism as the most suitable ideology for modern China. So Xi has relied on nationalism to inspire and unify the masses. From the South and East China Seas to the Himalayas, Xi defends what he sees as China’s rightful borders. He has chafed at U.S. attempts to keep the peace in the Pacific, dismissing Obama’s talk of “pivoting” to Asia as nothing more than containment of China by another term. “Matters in Asia ultimately must be taken care of by Asians,” Xi said at an international security conference in Shanghai in May. “Asia’s problems ultimately must be resolved by Asians, and Asia’s security ultimately must be protected by Asians.”

China’s neighbors, most of whom are economically beholden to Beijing, worry about the country’s maritime expansion and military buildup. While Hu spoke of China’s “peaceful rise,” Xi has warned that the People’s Liberation Army needs to be on alert. “We must ensure that our troops are ready when called upon,” he told soldiers shortly after taking office, “that they are fully capable of fighting and that they must win every war.” New Chinese passports were issued the year Xi ascended to power that show boundaries conflicting with those claimed by eight other governments. China’s leaders insist they are not upping the ante, but they have not used multilateral forums to settle the disputes. Economic partners aside, Beijing has few true international allies. “China wants the status of being a superpower,” says the University of Sydney’s Brown, “but it doesn’t want the responsibility.”

The Nationalist Card

Xi has resorted to fulminating against an old bogeyman: the evil West, intent on subjugating China, just like it did 150 years ago when imperial powers exploited the enfeebled Qing dynasty. Last year an internal government memo circulated listing seven Western values and institutions that China must battle at all costs, including constitutional democracy, media independence, civil society and market liberalism. Even the “universal values” of human rights were seen as unfit for Chinese consumption. Instead, Xi has promoted the Communist Party above any other institution, including the Chinese courts and the constitution.

Just a couple of years ago, Xi had to tolerate Western disapproval. On a February 2012 trip to the U.S., before he became China’s leader, Xi received an official champagne toast from Joe Biden, from one Vice President to another. In his lengthy remarks, Biden blasted–diplomatically, of course–China’s habit of locking up dissidents, its pillaging of intellectual property and trade secrets and its undervalued currency. “Xi stood there with a Cheshire-cat grin on his face,” recalls Richard Solomon, a veteran East Asia hand at the State Department who attended the event. “But he must have been enraged–to put it in Chinese terms–at the real loss of face, and not giving him the kind of respect that he felt he deserved.”

Now the tables have turned. Obama may bring a long list of requests to Beijing this month–a rollback on Chinese cyberspying, more market access and better treatment of ethnic minorities–but Chinese state media have already been scaling back expectations for the U.S. President’s visit. A Nov. 5 online commentary in the People’s Daily criticized the U.S. for “double standards in the fight against terrorism” and warned Washington to tread lightly on trouble spots like North Korea and Beijing’s poor relations with Tokyo. Wang Fan, vice president of China Foreign Affairs University, was quoted as saying: “Such hot issues touch upon China’s core interests.”

Beyond geopolitics, Xi and Co. have unleashed a crackdown on foreign businesses operating in China, nailing them for antitrust violations, bribery and substandard products. Yes, domestic companies have been targeted too, but it’s hard not to see an antiforeign bias in the crusade, which has harnessed the state media. Everyone from Microsoft and McDonald’s to Apple and Audi has been shamed. A summer survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China found that 60% of respondents felt the welcome for foreign business had chilled, while the European Chamber of Commerce complained that it had “received numerous alarming anecdotal accounts from a number of sectors that administrative intimidation tactics are being used to impel companies to accept punishments and remedies without full hearings.”

For all of Xi’s populist charm and global ambitions, his tenure has also been marked by a brittleness at odds with the image of an aspiring superpower. Hundreds of Chinese who have dared to question the wisdom of the party have been locked up, most with no due process. Xi has tightened controls on the Internet, silencing even voices that parroted the party’s own modest reform goals. In tiny Hong Kong, the former British outpost that is governed by separate laws from the rest of China, Beijing has given no indication that it will consider the wishes of the thousands of residents who have taken to the streets to demand democratic concessions for their city.

The crackdown on dissent has reached ridiculous proportions. Over the past month, for example, Chinese security personnel have rounded up more than a dozen people in an artist’s colony outside Beijing. Some were taken away for posting articles about the pro-democracy protests shaking Hong Kong. Others were detained at a poetry reading. People who tried to help the detainees’ families were themselves picked up. “The arrested artists did not want to be martyrs and none of them tried to organize a rebellion,” says an artist surnamed Han, who does not want his full name used because so many of his friends are now in jail. “They just wanted to express themselves.”

A Clean Image

To Xi, such free expression and debate may be among the Western iniquities the party must guard against if it is to avoid the fate of the defunct Soviet Union. “Why did the Soviet Communist Party collapse?” Xi asked in a December 2012 internal speech that was later leaked. “An important reason was that their ideals and beliefs had been shaken.” Perhaps the battle against independent thinkers also proves Xi’s innate conservatism, despite the hopes that he would follow in the footsteps of his more liberal-minded father. Or maybe it’s simply the mark of a man beset by the multitude of challenges that come with leading one-fifth of humanity. If Xi is clearly in charge of China, then it is he who will take the fall if the economy slows drastically and social unrest explodes. “Discontent [in China] is on the rise,” says Dan Blumenthal, director of Asian studies at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. “People are wealthier. The deal that was made–‘shut up, and you’ll get wealthy’–is coming to an end. They want a lot more than that.”

What the Chinese people are getting instead is a leader whose image is so controlled that little is left to chance. Earlier this year, a cartoon was released on a government-linked website featuring Xi–unremarkable in a Western context but revolutionary in a country where leaders are not to be made fun of, even gently. The Xi caricature was jolly-looking, with a pleasing belly and inoffensive gray-and-blue clothes. Then came the flood of analysis, presumably state-sanctioned, as to why this cartoon meant all of China should adore Xi Jinping. The Global Times, a patriotic newspaper, even wrote approvingly of the angle of Xi’s cartoon feet in an online infographic: “His wide-toed stance is deliberate to make the President seem more open to the people.”

A similar exhaustive outpouring followed the publication of last month’s Shanghai Observer story. But when Time tried to contact the author of the profile, the facade of journalistic credibility crumbled. An Observer employee admitted that the reporter’s name might be a pseudonym and that he had never met the writer. “His articles are always forwarded to me by someone else,” he said, declining to disclose who that sender was.

14,14,FL-2014-000154-IDN,That Sinking Feeling: Rising Sea Level Isn't Cities' Only Water Worry - NBCNews.com,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/sinking-feeling-rising-sea-level-isnt-cities-only-water-worry-n238786,"Some of the world’s expanding coastal cities face a two-pronged threat involving water: Sticking giant straws into the ground to suck up freshwater can cause the ground below to sink at the same time that sea levels are rising.

That interplay between subsiding land and rising seas highlights an underappreciated risk in global climate change, according to scientists.

It’s not known how many people live on coastal lands that are sinking due to excessive groundwater pumping, but about 150 million live within 3.3 feet of today's high-tide mark. And the worst-case scenario for sea level rise by the end of this century is nearly six feet, according to a recent study.

""The thing about the subsidence is that it is localized, but where it happens it is bad,"" Jay Famiglietti, a hydrologist and groundwater expert affiliated with the University of California, Irvine, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., told NBC News. ""It can be a foot or more a year, which is a lot.""

Some areas in Bangkok, Thailand, for example, have sunk more than three feet since the mid-1970s. Other coastal regions at the confluence of rapid population growth and sinking land include parts of Bangladesh, India and China, noted John Moore, a glaciologist at Beijing Normal University in China, and a co-author of the study on sea-level rise published Oct. 10 in Environmental Research Letters.

""In China there is a huge amount of new (construction) on reclaimed coastal land that's within perhaps three meters (10 feet) of sea level, so the cities, of course, are under big threat from storm flood events,"" he told NBC News.

A recent warning from the insurer Lloyd's of London pointed to Jakarta, Indonesia, as the world's fastest sinking megacity, with some areas of it having subsided more than 12 feet in the past 35 years.

Worst-case sea level rise

Moore and colleagues determined an upper limit for global sea level rise by the year 2100 using a combination of expert opinion and studies of the various dynamics that contribute to rising seas, including the melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, the expansion of ocean waters as they warm, and changes in water stored on land.

The worst-case sea-level rise of 5.9 feet could be reached if countries around the world continue to grow their economies predominantly with fossil fuels, as they are now, noted Moore. ""There is only, in our estimation, a 5 percent probability of exceeding that"" nearly six-foot rise by 2100, he said.

Determining an upper limit for sea level is a tricky, largely because significant scientific uncertainty remains on the processes that drive ice sheets to melt, Moore and colleagues note in their study.

Groundwater gray area

Another gray area comes in calculating the contribution to sea level from groundwater pumping. A 2012 study published in Geophysical Research Letters suggested extracting “fossil” water could be pushing up seas as much as melting glaciers outside of Greenland and Antarctica, which is on the order 0.6 millimeters a year.

""You are basically extracting water that was stored hundreds or thousands of years ago and you're adding additional water to the hydrological cycle which normally ends up in the ocean,"" Yoshihide Wada, a global water and food security researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands who led the groundwater study, told NBC News.

According to Famiglietti, Wada's finding and similar ones from other research groups likely overstate the significance of the effect of groundwater pumping on sea level rise. He is currently using data from NASA's gravity sensing satellites to study the issue and, in unpublished work, said he sees a zero-sum trend. As some areas lose water, he noted, others get wetter, which tends to balance things out.

In addition, he said, ""we just don't have good measurements to say with any confidence when you extract groundwater for pumping, for irrigation, and you apply it to the surface, … how much infiltrates back into the ground, how much runs off, how much evaporates.""

Nevertheless, he added, excessive groundwater pumping that leads to subsidence ""is a very big issue."" Where it is happening, and to what degree, however, is currently poorly studied. A good place to look, he said, is cities built on deltas. ""Some big fraction of the population lives on deltas,"" he noted. ""And those deltas actually store a lot of groundwater. When you pump it out, there is a lot of subsidence.""

On the rebound

On the flipside, Moore and colleagues note in their paper, some cities such as Stockholm, Sweden, are actually rising on the order of a few millimeters a year due to a phenomenon known as post-glacial rebound, where the land springs up in the absence of the weight of ice sheets from the last ice age.

""That isn't going to be a dramatic effect except for a few places around Scandinavia and maybe Canada,"" Moore said. ""They are not massive at-risk cities for future sea level rise. Most of the population is fairly outside of that region that was depressed by the large ice sheets in the glaciation.""

One other effect to consider when planning for sea level rise locally is the amount of gravitational pull from the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. Currently, both are so large they actually attract higher seas. As the ice melts, this pull relaxes, causing regional sea levels to fall. Thus, if Greenland melts faster than Antarctica, for example, sea levels could actually fall in northern Europe.

""You get a bigger rise if Antarctica melts preferentially because we don't get any gravitational bonus, if you like, from Antarctica in Europe and North America,"" Moore explained. ""But our most likely guess is that they won't melt that differently in the sort of 100-year time scale.""","Sat, 01 Nov 2014 07:00:00 GMT","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2014_44/746746/141101-bangkok-floods-mn-1810-746746.JPG","['water', 'sea', 'antarctica', 'cities', 'isnt', 'worry', 'rising', 'feeling', 'sheets', 'rise', 'groundwater', 'ice', 'level', 'feet', 'sinking', 'moore']",

16,16,FL-2014-000154-IDN,Asian LNG buyers disappointed by slow pace of gain in U.S. gas exports - The Japan Times,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/11/03/business/asian-lng-buyers-disappointed-by-slow-pace-of-gain-in-u-s-gas-exports/,"North American liquefied natural gas projects, once believed to be the panacea that would save Asia from paying top dollar for the super chilled fuel, are proving to be less of a game-changer than originally expected.

High costs, grueling regulatory processes and mounting social opposition have slowed the development of new capacity in Canada and the United States, tempering early hopes that a flood of cheap western gas would drive down prices.

A sudden rise in demand for LNG after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011 created a tight market for the commodity, pushing Asian prices to new highs and sending buyers scrambling to make deals with fledgling producers in North America.

Three years later, the majority of projected U.S. and Canadian volumes are still as much as a decade from first shipment, making it difficult for them to spare Asia from LNG prices that have been up to twice as expensive as natural gas in European markets this year.

“A few years ago, there was a kind of enthusiasm that U.S. LNG would solve everything, that is the ‘Captain America’ story,” Ken Koyama, chief economist at Japan’s Institute of Energy Economics, told reporters on the sidelines of the Singapore International Energy Week conference. “As we gain a better understanding of the U.S.’s possible role in LNG in Asia, we are still very much interested in it, but we are not so excited.”

North America’s first LNG export terminal, Cheniere Energy Inc’s Sabine Pass, is currently under construction, with initial LNG cargoes expected by late 2015.

Shovels hit the ground last month on a second U.S. Gulf Coast terminal, Sempra Energy’s Cameron LNG project, with two further projects approved by U.S. regulators for non-free trade exports, and numerous more under review.

In Canada, Malaysia’s Petronas is expected to make a final investment decision on its Pacific NorthWest LNG project by mid-December and could potentially start building the U.S. neighbor’s first ever LNG export terminal in 2015.

But last month state-owned Petronas threatened to delay that project by up to 15 years unless a favorable tax deal was reached, and last week BG Group pushed back an investment decision on its Canadian project by a year to 2017.

While the promise of North American LNG exports has had an effect on Asian markets, helping drive a shift to new hybrid price contracts and flexible delivery models, the slow rate of development has muted the overall impact.

“There’s a lot of gas reserves in Canada and the U.S.,” said Hoe-Wai Cheong, executive vice president at Black & Veatch Corp. “But if you look at the pace by which that’s coming out and the amount of gas that will ultimately be exported, I don’t believe it will have a significant impact on the global LNG pricing.”

Demand for LNG is expected to increase by 40 percent through 2025 to roughly 350 million tons per annum, according to data from GDF Suez. Driving that growth are new markets in China, India and Southeast Asia.

At the same time, dozens of projects have been proposed for Canada and the United States, as energy companies look to tap into cheap North American gas to feed rising Asian demand.

But experts say the vast majority of those export terminals will never be built, with just a handful expected to proceed on either side of the border.

And while initial volumes from the Gulf Coast of the United States are expected next year, there are questions around how much will actually end up in Asian markets.

“It’s probably a misconception that U.S. LNG is all going to Asia,” said Nicholas Browne, an analyst with Wood Mackenzie. “If you look at the companies involved in certain projects, such as Corpus Christi, it’s predominantly European utilities.”

Cheniere has signed sales contracts with Asian buyers like Indonesia’s Pertamina and South Korea’s Kogas, but concerns remain on the ultimate cost of shipping that gas through the Panama Canal, especially as the spot prices for LNG deliveries into Asia have fluctuated in a broad range this year.

LNG spot prices dropped from a multiyear peak at $20.50 per million British thermal units in February to a post-Fukushima low of $10.60 in August, as demand growth slowed and as a run-off in global oil benchmarks pulled energy values lower.

Canada, on the other hand, benefits from far shorter shipping distances to Asia, though the cost of building new pipeline and liquefaction infrastructure is high, making it hard to justify the initial investment if prices stay low.

Adding to that risk is a slow regulatory process, difficult negotiations with Aboriginal communities and new taxes. In some cases, sales margins are proving to be razor thin, putting the ultimate feasibility of projects at risk.

“If the fundamental economics do not work, these projects will not happen,” Aaron Engen, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, told an industry audience at the conference.

Despite the challenges, Canada is attractive to integrated trading companies who want exposure to more of the value chain, said Nick Kouvaritakis, a lawyer with Herbert Smith Freehills.

By taking stakes in both upstream developments and export terminals, proponents can hedge themselves against fluctuations in the North American gas price.

“I think that’s really the fundamental advantage of the Canadian projects,” he said, adding that if risks are managed, there is potential for a significant upside.

With much of the new capacity in North America now expected to come online in the 2020s, that supply could prove to be attractive to emerging buyers like China and India, rather than traditional markets in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

Still, competition from other emerging regions like East Africa will be fierce — particularly from frontier fields in Mozambique — and North American projects could be hindered by political and regulatory constraints.

“Gas exports in U.S. are still in a gray zone. Not forbidden, but not encouraged,” said Chen Wei Dong, senior economist with CNOOC Energy Economics Institute. “In Canada, there’s a lot of waiting . . . it’s slow, no hurry like China.”","Mon, 03 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://cdn-japantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/b-lngasia-a-20141104-870x489.jpg,"['pace', 'buyers', 'asian', 'lng', 'disappointed', 'projects', 'expected', 'slow', 'markets', 'asia', 'gain', 'canada', 'exports', 'gas', 'north', 'energy', 'prices']",

The tsunami that followed shortly after a 9.0 mega-quake off the east coast of Japan was shocking in its magnitude - killing close to 16,000. But it was soon apparent that another disaster was in the making, when the surging waves inundated pumps used to cool down the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power complex.

The resultant fuel meltdown and leakage of radiation led to the immediate evacuation of the site, and a chain of events that eventually had Japan shutting down all of its nuclear reactors. Germany, a major consumer of nuclear power, permanently closed 8 of its 17 nuclear reactors following Fukushima; other European countries shelved their nuclear plans.

While nuclear proponents view Fukushima as an aberration and trust that nuclear is mostly safe, opponents hold it, and other major accidents such as Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, as exemplifying the perils of nuclear power generation.

Oilprice.com took a look at the countries whose nuclear power plants would be most vulnerable to a tsunami. We based our list - which is in no particular order - on a report by the Community Research and Development Information Service (CORDIS), part of the European Commission, which mapped out the world's geographic zones that would be at most risk of large tsunamis. We then cross-referenced those countries with information from the World Nuclear Association, on each country's nuclear program. According to the CORDIS report, 23 nuclear power plants with 74 reactors were identified in high-risk areas. The riskiest country was China, which has 27 reactors currently under construction, the largest number in the world. Of those 27, 17 are being built in areas considered dangerous for tsunamis.

China

China currently has 21 operating nuclear plants, and 27 being built. The Chinese government plans to triple the country's nuclear power capacity to 48 GWe (gigawatt electrical) by 2020. This is mostly to move away from coal-powered plants for environmental reasons. China's most active earthquake zones are in the interior, far from its existing nuclear plants on the east coast. However, high earthquake activity on the Chinese east coast should not discount this threat. Moreover, as its electricity needs grow, China is likely to site new nuclear plants in the interior, including two proposed reactors in Sichuan - the site of a major quake in 2013.

Taiwan

Taiwan's six nuclear reactors provide a quarter of the island nation's base load power. Two of the reactors cited in the CORDIS report are in Taiwan. Taiwan has signed an agreement with China, whereby the two countries pledge to share information on their nuclear power plants and safety standards. Like Japan, Taiwan is considered high-risk of nuclear reactor damage from tsunamis due to its high frequency of earthquakes, historically, correlated to its land area - which is known as seismic density.

Japan

Japan has 7 plants with 19 reactors at risk of tsunamis, including Fukushima I, according to the CORDIS report. The country is currently in the process of restarting 48 reactors following a country-wide shutdown and safety review following the accident. A number of measures have been taken to shore up Japan's tsunami defences. Hokkaido is building a 6.5-meter-high seawall that will run 1.25-km at its Tomari site. Kansai will spend $2.5 billion over four years to earthquake and tsunami-proof its 11 reactors. Chubu Electric Power Co is increasing tsunami and flood protection at its Hamaoka nuclear plant, located in a region of high seismic activity.

South Korea

Twenty-three reactors provide 20.7 GWe of electricity, nearly a third of the country's needs. A planned 59 percent increase would bump capacity to 32.9 GWe by 2022. After Fukushima, the Korean government took measures to increase nuclear safety, including raising the coastal barrier at its Kori 1 reactor to 10 meters, waterproofing pumps, and fitting watertight doors to emergency diesel generator buildings. The investment represents about $1 billion over five years. However, CORDIS identified five reactors at tsunami risk, through the expansion of two plants.

United States

Many seismologists believe that the Cascadia subduction zone, running from Vancouver Island to northern California, is overdue for a major earthquake of equal force to what occurred recently in Japan and Chile, on other parts of the ""Ring of Fire"". That puts the U.S. on the high end of the risk scale, especially since the States is the world's largest producer of nuclear power, with 100 operating reactors and five under construction. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission put out a report in 2011 rating the nuclear reactors of highest risk of earthquake damage. Surprisingly, the Diablo Canyon power plant situated between the California coastline and the San Andreas fault was not considered most prone to a tsunami. That's because reactors constructed in California were built to withstand a major earthquake. Number 1 on the NRC list was the Indian Point Energy Center located 24 kilometers from New York City, with second and third positions occupied by nuclear power plants in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, respectively.

Pakistan

Pakistan has a small nuclear program, with just 725 MWe of capacity, but wants to increase that 10-fold - despite opprobrium from arch-rival India which fears the diversion of uranium into nuclear weapons. A 7.7-magnitude quake struck Pakistan's remote southwest region in 2013, killing at least 328. CORDIS identified one Pakistani reactor in its report that is at risk of a tsunami.

India

CORDIS also mentioned two nuclear reactors in India that could face tsunami damage. On a map of nuclear power plants either operating or under construction in India, the World Nuclear Association identifies 3 of 7 plants situated on the coast. India's seismicity is well-documented. A mega-quake measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale hit Gujarat in 2001, killing over 20,000. The same number of people were killed 8 years earlier, during a quake in Maharashtra.

Iran

Iran currently has one operating nuclear reactor, with a second one planned, despite calls by the UN Security Council to scrap its uranium enrichment program. After the Japanese tsunami, then-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claimed that its Brushehr nuclear plant could not be hit because the facility is more modern than the 40-year-old Fukushima complex. In 2013, two earthquakes, one at 5.6 magnitude and the other at 6.1, struck the region around the Brushehr plant. The larger quake killed at least 37 and injured hundreds more. In both earthquakes, Brushehr was left undamaged.

TIERKIDI REFUGEE CAMP, Ethiopia, November 5 (UNHCR) - Ireland's President Michael D. Higgins has called on the international community to do much more to help tens of thousands of South Sudanese refugees in western Ethiopia.

""It is quite scandalous"" that less than half of the amount needed to provide protection and assistance to the refugees had come from the international community, Higgins said on Tuesday during a visit to the Tierkidi Refugee Camp in Ethiopia's Gambella region. ""The international community needs to do more,"" he stressed.

Angele Djohossou, head of the UNHCR sub-office in Gambella, had earlier told Higgins that only 46 percent of funding required for operations this year to meet the needs of the South Sudan refugees had been received so far.

Higgins, who praised the government and people of Ethiopia for taking in so many refugees, said stepped up assistance and funding would enable the provision of basic life-saving services, especially for refugees living in flood-affected areas.

During his tour of Tierkidi, home to almost 50,000 South Sudanese refugees, the Irish president watched malnourished children receive nutritional services under an Irish Aid programme. He told aid workers that Ireland has contributed US$2.6 million to humanitarian operations in the region. Despite its financial problems in recent years, Ireland donated a substantial US$13 million to UNHCR in 2013.

Since the outbreak of conflict in South Sudan in mid-December 2013, more than 190,000 South Sudanese have crossed into the Gambella region to seek refuge amid continuing fighting and elusive attempts to find peace. The new refugee arrivals add to the existing South Sudan refugee population of more than 43,000. Ethiopia provides shelter to more than 600,000 refugees, mainly from South Sudan, Somalia and Eritrea.","Wed, 05 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.unhcr.org/thumb1/545a49426.jpg,"['sudan', 'stepped', 'ethiopia', 'urges', 'region', 'irish', 'sudanese', 'south', 'refugees', 'aid', 'president', 'unhcr', 'higgins', 'refugee']",

21,21,FL-2014-000154-IDN,What caused the 'pause' in global warming? - The Conversation US,https://theconversation.com/what-caused-the-pause-in-global-warming-32257,"Many people around the world, in certain locations, have asked, “where is global warming?” This is because they have experienced very cold wintry conditions and weird weather that they do not associate with a warming climate. Yet global warming and climate change may very well be factors in what they are experiencing.

Perhaps the first case in point was the northern winter of 2009-10 which was exceptionally cold in Europe. Yet 2009-10 was one of the warmest winters globally it was very warm in the northern half of North America, for instance. This picked-upon feeling was furthered in 2010-11 and 2012-13 winters, which again were very cold in Europe but not elsewhere. Why is that and what is causing it?

Then this past winter of 2013-14 it was the turn of the eastern half of the United States to suffer through unusually cold and snowy conditions. At the same time there were record high temperatures in Alaska and along the West Coast as a record-breaking drought developed in California. It was also exceptionally wet in southern England and widespread flooding developed.

The fact that the exceptionally cold spots were localized about 2% of the globe while quite warm conditions existed elsewhere, and especially in the Arctic, provides a clue. Atmospheric circulation via waves in the jet stream plays a role.

El Niño

The weather is never normal. Instead, it fluctuates between times of cooler conditions and warmer conditions as weather systems migrate across the globe, accompanied by rain or snow.

Sometimes large-scale waves in the atmosphere get stuck and so instead of varying weather, the weather repeats over and over again, as cold outbreaks recur in the same spots while drought develops somewhere else and floods prevail elsewhere. This is what has happened in the US last winter, where the East Coast shivered through a polar vortex while the West Coast suffered from a long drought that continued through the summer.

It is not new – the theory behind this was developed in the 1980s. A key region, it turns out, is the tropical Pacific Ocean and the El Niño phenomenon. Interactions between the atmosphere and ocean in the tropical Pacific allow an El Niño event to develop over a period of a year to 18 months. This leads to a warming of the central and eastern tropical Pacific.

This changes the distribution of tropical storms, from hurricanes to thunderstorms, which in turn leads to large-scale waves in the atmosphere, altering the jet stream and storm tracks. Usually these are in the Pacific-rim countries but the waves can extend farther downstream across the Americas into the Atlantic. Scientists call these links “teleconnections”.

What does this mean for climate change?

A recent paper I worked on applies these ideas to the so-called hiatus in global warming. Global mean temperatures climbed steadily from the 1970s until 1998, but have stagnated since then.

Trenberth et al (2014) Nature Climate Change

This has been picked up by climate change deniers to suggest that global warming is not what scientists have said. However, we suggest on our paper that global warming continues but is manifested in different ways. Focusing on the tropical Pacific as a core region for major changes in rainfall and a source of continental-scale waves in the atmosphere shows how regional cold spots can happen.

We highlight that cold winters in Europe go along with a warm Arctic. In fact it is likely the Arctic has warmed more than otherwise expected owing to the wave patterns that have occurred over the past decade. So “Arctic amplification” is a consequence, not a cause of the increased waves, as has been suggested in the past.

Storing heat in the ocean

We can also use this model to explain patterns of change in Antarctic sea ice: reductions in the Antarctic Peninsula area while there have been expansions in the South Pacific. The connections extend from the tropical Pacific to the Atlantic in both hemispheres in winter: to the North Atlantic and Europe in northern winter, and across South America in southern winter, and to the southern oceans.

These changes in the atmosphere cause changes in the ocean and have led to heat being stored deeper than 700m in the ocean. while heat has also been carried down deeper in the subtropical Pacific, away from the surface.

The largest region of the planet that has not warmed in the 2000s is the eastern half of the Pacific Ocean. The planet is warming, but heat is effectively being dumped deeper in the ocean.

Pacific Decadal Variability

Scientists have documented many aspects of the variability I’ve described, and are now refocused on the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, as it has been called, as a key to these large-scale patterns of change.

22,22,FL-2014-000154-IDN,"Egypt Razes Homes, Plans Moat Near Gaza - Voice of America",https://www.voanews.com/world-news/middle-east-dont-use/egypt-razes-homes-plans-moat-near-gaza,"CAIRO - Egypt began razing houses and moving hundreds of families living along the Gaza border Wednesday, as part of sweeping efforts to stop what authorities say are ""terrorist operations"" originating in the Palestinian territory via tunnels.

The plan reportedly includes digging a channel filled with sea water to stop further tunneling under the border, according to Arab media.

The evacuation follows a state of emergency declaration in northern Sinai prompted by an attack that killed more than 30 Egyptian soldiers last Friday. Authorities also announced a dawn-to-dusk curfew in the wake of the attack, the deadliest on Egyptian soldiers in years.

Footage shown by Al Jazeera showed a bulldozer knocking down a cement- and cinder-block buildings in the northern Sinai town of Rafah. The report said Egyptian authorities had ordered 600 families in one area of Rafah to leave their homes.

Egyptian media reported that local army commanders gave residents 48 hours to remove belongings. Reports said families were being paid to move out.

Officials believe last week’s attack was linked to forces inside Gaza, Egyptian political sociologist Said Sadek said.

""Their aim is to reduce social or military support from Gaza. The idea is that you create a real buffer zone that makes it difficult for any big operation to take place. Egypt and Israel agree on this,” Sadek said. “There is a lot of security coordination between the two countries, because they have a common enemy: terrorism.”

Al Arabiya said the Egyptian military was planning to build what amounted to a moat, filled with sea water, along the 9-mile border between Gaza and the Sinai, to flood existing tunnels and deter building new ones.

Complicating matters is the population of northern Sinai, which is dominated by Bedouin, who have a history of prickly relations with Cairo, Sadek said.

Egypt has been roiled by unrest since July 2013 when the military ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi. Militant attacks on the Sinai have killed hundreds of soldiers and law enforcement officers since that time.","Wed, 29 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/F846DF00-1D5C-451E-8A43-B051FC22FF9B.jpg,"['soldiers', 'moat', 'gaza', 'families', 'egyptian', 'razes', 'egypt', 'authorities', 'homes', 'northern', 'border', 'near', 'sadek', 'military', 'plans', 'sinai']",

But forward thinking and innovative approaches can help revitalize and boost the resilience of these resources and ecosystems, and the people who rely on them. Paula Caballero, Senior Director for the World Bank’s Environment and Natural Resources Global Practice witnessed this first-hand in Mali, Burkina Faso, Tanzania, and Ethiopia.

“Africa’s story is often one of extraordinary endeavour and human perseverance in the face of severe challenges,” said Ms. Caballero, Senior Director, after her visit to Sub-Saharan Africa. “In all the countries I visited, the link was clear between natural resources management and growth—not only today, but also for tomorrow.”

Changing Lives along the Great Green Wall

Caballero visited sections of the $1.1 Billion Bank-funded program supporting African countries’ Great Green Wall Initiative, which has had a positive impact on local communities and farmers in Burkina, Ethiopia, Mali and 9 other countries. Developed under TerrAfrica, the program aims to improve the resilience of lands and its people.

In Mali, where drought is a fact of life, 8% of the GDP is lost every year due to land degradation. Over the past few years, the Bank has supported programs to roll back the desertification processes and enhance the resilience of communities to climate change. Recently, the Government of Mali asked for Bank assistance to rehabilitate and protect the inner Niger River Delta—a vast wetland that is fragile and especially vulnerable to climate change and degradation. The Delta is vital to the livelihoods of millions of people in Mali, and 8 other countries that surround it. 40% of Mali’s livestock—over 2 million cows and 4 million goats and sheep—migrate to the Delta region during the scorching dry months.

In Burkina Faso, an inspiring visit with Yacouba Sawadogo—known as The Man Who Stopped the Desert—showed that drylands are not inevitable. Sawadogo, a farmer from one of the poorest countries on earth, achieved what many experts dream of: Halting the desert. In just 20 years, he converted a completely barren area into a thriving 64-acre forest with 87 species of trees. “I started replanting this forest because I wanted to cure the land and cure the people,” said Sawadogo. “Now, I produce more than I can eat. I will sell the surplus and use the medicinal plants to cure people. What I have done and continue doing is for the next generation and for the entire humanity.”","Wed, 29 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/share-logo/social-share.jpg,"['visited', 'mali', 'lands', 'degradation', 'countries', 'restoring', 'natural', 'africa', 'burkina', 'resources', 'lives', 'resilience', 'cure', 'visit', 'livelihoods']",

Pakistan’s fresh produce exporters association, the PFVA, told The Express Tribune it had “chalked out a strategy” to increase exports to the Russian market, which is in search of alternative import sources for fruit and vegetables worth some US$2bn since banning agricultural products from the EU and the US in August.

Pakistan, which exports primarily kinnow mandarins and potatoes to Russia, wants to capture a 5-10 per cent share of its fresh produce market, the PFVA said.

“We look forward to having an upward trend in the coming season due to the ban on Europe,” Waheed Ahmed, spokesman for Pakistan’s Fruit and Vegetable association (PFVA), told Fruitnet. “Exporters hope to capitalise on this opportunity and win a substantial share of the market.”

Pakistan expects to see a significant rise in its kinnow mandarin shipments to Russia this season as a direct result of the EU ban, said Ahmed.

“We definitely expect to increase our kinnow export there by 15-20 per cent compared to last season, but this will also depend on our local production.”

Pakistan has set a kinnow export target of around 300,000 tonnes (out of a potential 2m-tonne crop) this season, similar to last year, said Ahmed.

However the Punjab province has been badly affected by floods, the effects of which on crop quality and quantity remain to be seen.

“The true picture will come in November,” said Ahmed, adding that kinnow exports will start on 1 December.

“The recent floods and coming climate conditions could possibly affect exports,” he added. “It is rather too early to say, but we do expect a good season for Pakistani kinnow exports this year.”","Tue, 04 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",http://upload.evocdn.co.uk/fruitnet/uploads/asset_image/2_22333_e.jpg,"['kinnow', 'targets', 'pfva', 'share', 'season', 'pakistans', 'russian', 'russia', 'told', 'exports', 'produce', 'pakistan', 'market']",

– The Singapore Institute of International Affairs (SIIA) will work with Indonesian, Malaysian and Singapore experts, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and agribusiness companies to gather more information about the causes of the haze, and sites where the fires burn.The efforts aim to combine real-time thermal hotspots, wind direction, land use and, where possible, concession maps on a dynamic online platform. This will allow law enforcers, environmental activists, commodity buyers and traders, journalists and any interested member of the public to analyse the source of the haze as it hits. This online portal will also host commentaries, reports and videos on the subject of transboundary haze.Announcing the initiative at the SIIA Haze Roundtable “Beyond politics: Facilitating ground-up initiatives”, the SIIA Chairman Simon Tay said the effort runs ahead of the governments for good reason.“Until ASEAN governments can move things forward with the joint haze monitoring system (HMS), there is a need to plug an information gap in collaboration with our NGO and corporate partners,” said Professor Tay. “We believe reliable and transparent information is crucial if we want to deter slash-and-burn and other unsustainable practices in the resource sector,” he added.ASEAN leaders in principle adopted the HMS in October 2013 after the severe haze spell last June. Developed by Singapore, the $100,000 monitoring system was designed to facilitate the identification of fire and haze culprits by overlaying high-resolution satellite images on land use and concession maps. The launch was stalled, however, as some member countries were reluctant to make public their maps due to legal concerns.In the development of its portal, the SIIA will seek input from its NGO partners with relevant expertise, such as the World Resources Institute (WRI), which is running the Global Forest Watch platform to monitor deforestation rate in Indonesia.This effort was endorsed by some 40 academics, corporate and NGO representatives gathered at the SIIA Haze Roundtable at The Regent to review the haze situation this year.Additionally, the institute will also be holding its first public exhibition “Haze: Know it. Stop it” at VivoCity from. The exhibition will be officially launched by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Health and Manpower at“Transboundary haze is more than an environmental hazard. It affects public health. It hurts many businesses. It is also a diplomatic issue. We hope our exhibition can help the public understand the issue more broadly,” said the SIIA Deputy Director and Fellow for ASEAN Business and Sustainability. “We will also be sharing what consumers and businesses in Singapore can do to help stop the haze,” said Mr Chua.","Thu, 06 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",http://13.212.226.79/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Haze-2013.png,"['ngo', 'maps', 'portal', 'institute', 'information', 'exhibition', 'tay', 'siia', 'haze', 'singapore', 'public', 'thinktank', 'host', 'plans']", 
28,28,FL-2014-000154-IDN,"Move over, McMansions – the tiny house movement is here - The Conversation AU",https://theconversation.com/move-over-mcmansions-the-tiny-house-movement-is-here-32225,"A small group of people is gathered around a campfire in a Victorian State Forest. Members of the Tiny Houses Australia community, they’re attending a Spring Camp to talk about how to build a tiny house, and compare notes on how to address common barriers, like local government planning schemes.

The group is diverse, from students to professionals and retirees. One has been living temporarily in caravans. Others were forced to move into shared accommodation or board with family. Most have given up on the idea of buying their own home, put off by the high price tag or the size of the mortgage, or the downside of living far from family or employment.

Most of the group are also fierce promoters of a more sustainable, minimalist way of life who want their new houses to reflect this. You won’t find many en suites or walk-in wardrobes in their floor plans.

Is bigger really better?

Something is wrong when a professional earning A$170,000 cannot afford to live close to work; or a doctor needs a parental loan to buy a house. All 25 major urban housing markets in Australia are ranked as severely unaffordable; and Australia has the second most unaffordable housing market among member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Australian houses are also among the largest in the OECD. In 2008, the average new house was 214 square metres, double the size of an average 1950s house. Very large houses are not only more expensive, but environmentally unsustainable. For example, the major factors that determine a house’s greenhouse gas emissions are its size and location; the bigger and more isolated the house, the larger its emissions.

For many, particularly young people entering the market and older people leaving the workforce, the “great Australian dream” of a big house on a quarter-acre block is a distant fantasy. And even for those who are living the dream, a sudden interest-rate rise, job loss or chronic illness could rapidly turn it into a nightmare.

Regardless of the debate over whether we’re in a housing bubble, the affordability problem is much broader than property prices. The most serious issue is the lack of affordable rental accommodation.

Finding sanctuary in a tiny house

From this backdrop has emerged a trend towards building much smaller houses. The tiny house movement originated in the United States in the late 1990s, largely in response to problems with housing affordability, although it has also been spurred on by the global financial crisis and a widespread desire to live more sustainably. The movement has now spread to New Zealand, Australia and Canada.

Tiny houses are generally smaller than 40 sq m, and can take many forms, from granny flats, to repurposed shipping containers, to a complete houses built on trailers.

The Tiny Abode Co. , Author provided

The benefits of tiny houses include overall sustainability, reduced energy and water use (tiny houses are often “off the grid”) and, of course, affordability. Some tiny houses can cost less than A$10,000. Moreover, they use significantly less resources to build, and are often constructed from salvaged materials or sustainably sourced products.

Mobile tiny houses could even help their inhabitants adapt to climate change; a house on wheels can be moved out of danger from floods or storm surges. They can allow adult children or aged parents to live independently, yet maintain access to family, employment and public transport.

Tiny houses can even address aspects of homelessness. In the United States, some local governments are donating land for homeless people to build their own tiny homes.

The biggest issues with a tiny house

Although information is plentiful on building techniques, plans and design, it is not very easy to build a tiny house. However, as attendees at the Spring Camp agreed, perhaps the biggest problem with building a tiny house is finding a place to put it.

Tiny houses do not conform to many local government planning schemes or building codes, which mandate minimum house sizes, maximum number of houses per plot, connection to utilities, parking provisions, and restrictions on temporary occupation.

It might also be argued that allowing tiny houses will reduce land values and lead to health and safety concerns, such as overcrowding. But people currently live in crowded conditions or illegally in sheds or caravans.

Some states, such as New South Wales, allow property owners to build granny flats. In other states, the regulations differ between and within each local government, although almost almost all have restrictions on the duration of temporary occupation.

For non property-owners, particularly those who don’t want to take any legal risks, the options are fewer. And of course, local governments can and should impose planning restrictions on tiny houses, and ensure that they comply with building codes and standards.

Tiny houses are not for everyone. They will probably always remain a niche market, more suited to people with no children, or retirees.

Niche, yes, but for some people tiny houses could be a lifeline. Being unable to afford to buy property, fulfil mortgage commitments, or even rent a home can lead to mental and physical illness. In a sustainable city, everyone should be able to access affordable housing, and a tiny house is certainly better than no house at all.","Tue, 04 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/63233/original/sqmz63dv-1414623548.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['houses', 'live', 'movement', 'build', 'mcmansions', 'tiny', 'house', 'local', 'building', 'australia', 'housing', 'states']",

In less developed countries, it could be 30 to 40 per cent,"" she said.Preparing young people for jobs available through education and training was going to be one of the most significant questions for public policy and for private sector decision-makers, Hillary said.""We need more entrepreneurship.

39,39,FL-2014-000154-IDN,"Fox News seeds climate doubts, but liberal media also distort - The Conversation US",https://theconversation.com/fox-news-seeds-climate-doubts-but-liberal-media-also-distort-33565,"Recent Pew Research Center studies offer valuable insight on the ideological makeup of those Americans most likely to voice their opinion in politics generally and the climate debate specifically, including the news sources they rely on to articulate their arguments.

What’s clear from the Pew findings and related research is that the highly selective media habits of strongly conservative and liberal Americans are likely to be a major barrier to charting a path to progress on our tough, new planet.

In a June 2014 study, Pew found that the approximately 1 in 5 Americans who score as either consistently conservative (9%) or consistently liberal (12%) in their answers to a variety of questions, are far more likely to vote than other Americans and are at least twice as likely to volunteer for a campaign, contact an elected official, or donate money.

Consistent liberals and conservatives are also more likely than those with moderate opinions to view the opposing party negatively. Half of all consistent liberals and 2/3 of consistent conservatives believe that the policies of their partisan opponents are “so misguided that they threaten the nation’s well-being.” These feelings of extreme antipathy towards the other side are a major factor motivating their higher levels of political participation.

If the 1/5 of Americans who are the most ideological are also the most likely to participate in politics, then a large body of previous studies including my own research suggests that understanding the media sources they rely on to inform their opinions is critically important.

According to a Pew report released last week, among consistent conservatives, nearly half (47%) name the right-leaning Fox News as the news source they rely on most. In contrast, among consistent liberals, more than a third name either the left-leaning outlets MSNBC (12%), NPR (13%), or the New York Times (10%) as their main news source.

For conservatives turning to Fox News, studies conducted by Rutgers University’s Lauren Feldman and colleagues conclude that the cable network serves an influential political function in the climate debate, sustaining its viewers’ doubts about climate science even in the face of overwhelming contradictory evidence.

These doubts, Feldman told me via email, have become a key means by which Fox News viewing conservatives distinguish their political identity from liberals. In turn, the need to sustain core identity beliefs about climate change drives conservative viewers back to Fox in a reinforcing cycle.

In contrast, given the strong proportion of arguments at MSNBC emphasizing the urgency of climate change, Feldman’s studies conclude that heavier viewers of the network, along with other left-leaning and mainstream news sources, are more likely to be concerned about climate change and to support policy action.

More subtle liberal distortions

Yet the tendency of politically active liberals to rely on left-leaning outlets like MSNBC as news sources is likely to have other under-examined distorting effects on their climate change-related opinions and beliefs. These include at least four important impacts:

1. Misplaced hope in renewables. Many liberal commentators tend to focus on just a handful of policy actions and technologies to address climate change, advocating for example a carbon tax and renewable energy sources while dismissing nuclear energy or carbon capture and storage. Liberal audiences may therefore have a skewed outlook on what it will take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while meeting the global demand for economic growth. (See for example these recent headlines.)

2. Extreme weather fears. To the extent that left-leaning news sources play up the catastrophic consequences of climate change, as a recent study of international outlets suggests, or present “Franken-storms” like Hurricane Sandy as the new normal in a warming world, their audiences are likely to have a faulty perception of the causes and incidence of these events. Such portrayals may also promote feelings of hopelessness, fatalism, and avoidance.

3. No compromise with conservatives. As Duke University’s Frederick Mayer describes in a 2012 paper, among common narratives offered about climate change, MSNBC tends to emphasize what Mayer calls the “Denialist Conspiracy,” accounting for 23 percent of the story lines at the network, far more than any other cable news outlet.

Playing to the intense antipathy that liberals feel for conservatives, this conflict-focused narrative emphasizes that:

a shadowy network of oil-funded front groups and the politicians they control (the villains) mislead the gullible and the religious to subvert progress on climate change. Those who expose the conspiracy are the heroes. The moral of the story: opponents of acting on climate change are either corrupt or deluded. (Watch example)

Even in covering the release of major scientific reports, at MSNBC such moments were “less a hook for telling the environmental story than an opportunity to bash the right,” writes Mayer.

“The closest thing I know of as a way to goose my own ratings is to showcase some villainous behavior from a media figure on the right,” admitted MSNBC host Rachel Maddow in a 2010 speech. “The numbers rise then because there is an appetite for hearing that media figures on the right are terrible people doing terrible things.”

Fed a steady stream of arguments at MSNBC and other liberal outlets asserting the cynical and deceitful strategies of conservatives and their industry allies, politically active liberals are likely to believe that any efforts at negotiation or compromise with conservatives in the climate debate are either hopelessly misguided or motivated by the hidden influence of the fossil fuel industry.

When asked generally about policy disagreements with Republicans, according to Pew, consistent liberals believe that President Obama should give little to no ground, a disdain for compromise equivalent to that of their conservative counterparts.

4. Amplification via social media. As liberal groups and like-minded peers flood social media with links to MSNBC segments and other liberal media accounts, exposure among liberals to arguments exaggerating the potential of renewable energy, emphasizing extreme weather events, and stoking anger over conservative “denialists” are only likely to be amplified.

On this possibility, the Pew analysis finds that consistent liberals rely in greater proportion than other audience segments on Twitter and Facebook as news sources, pay closer attention to political posts at Facebook, and are more likely to follow via Facebook issue-based groups. Consistent liberals are also more likely than others to block or defriend someone because they disagree with their views.

To be sure, the strong reliance by conservatives on Fox News will continue to be a major obstacle to progress on climate change and should be a subject of extreme concern.

Yet the more subtle, less examined impact of left-leaning media on politically active liberals - including activists and donors among their ranks – deserves serious attention, even if for many of us such possibilities are inconvenient to consider.","Thu, 30 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/63095/original/8wdhb6tc-1414541835.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['liberal', 'climate', 'sources', 'change', 'likely', 'fox', 'liberals', 'media', 'seeds', 'distort', 'consistent', 'conservatives', 'msnbc', 'doubts']",

Shillong: Meghalaya Police have chargesheeted Social Welfare Minister Deborah C Marak for allegedly using the outlawed Garo National Liberation Army (GNLA) militants to intimidate voters during the Assembly elections last year.

The minister has, however, denied the charge.

East Garo Hills district SP Davis N R Marak told PTI today, the charge sheet was based on a complaint by the Independent candidate from Williamangar, Jonathon N Sangma, who had unsuccessfully contested the poll.

""After gathering enough evidence to prove that the accused had used underground elements to intimidate voters of independent candidate Jonathon Sangma on the eve of the 2013 state assembly elections, we have filed a charge sheet yesterday against Marak under Sections 102(B), 171(F) and 506 of the IPC in the local court,"" he said.

The charge sheet mentioned that a deal was struck and GNLA had intimidated voters in lieu of Marak's promised support to the cause of the outfit for a separate state.

Jonathon had alleged that Marak had used GNLA militants to intimidate villagers and ensure that they did not vote for him.

""I have not used any militant outfit to seek votes and if at all my supporters had used the help of militants, I cannot be blamed,"" Marak said.

The Social Welfare Minister, who had won four times earlier, claimed that she had never resorted to any unlawful activities.

Tennydard Marak, a GNLA leader and another accused, said the charge sheet could be a conspiracy to scuttle his move to pursue the case related to the ST status issue of the Chief Minister Mukul Sangma.

Tennydard is in the news for questioning the tribal status of the chief minister and is also pursuing the case in Supreme Court.

According to the SP, a week prior to the elections, posters were pasted in Williamnagar in Garo language stating 'Whoever votes (for) Jonathan, this is gun and this is bullet' with pictures of guns and bullets.

During investigation, it was found pasting of the posters was the handiwork of Deborah Marak, Tennydard Marak and certain GNLA leaders, he said.","Tue, 04 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/715_-/politicsnational/IndiaTv5f2cac_Deborah.jpg,"['militants', 'files', 'used', 'gnla', 'chargesheet', 'garo', 'voters', 'minister', 'marak', 'intimidate', 'charge', 'deborah', 'meghalaya', 'sheet']",

The report combines the Panel’s past work and reiterates the near unanimity in the scientific community regarding the man-made role in global climate change. Still, public and political perception is very much divided and the report aims to lay the foundation for a new global treaty on climate change by the end of next year. Stark in their assessment, the IPCC posits a grim future in the absence of any meaningful mitigation. Not all change is bad however, and, when examining the energy implications, global climate change produces its share of winners.



According to the Panel, the most recent 30-year period was likely the warmest of the last 1,400 years. Nowhere is that more apparent than in the oceans. Between 1971 and 2010, more than 90 percent of the energy accumulated in the climate system was stored in the ocean. Since the beginning of the industrial era, ocean acidification is up 26 percent and Arctic and sub-Arctic ice sheets have continued to shrink, increasing the rate of sea level rise worldwide. On land, spring snow cover has decreased in extent globally and permafrost temperatures have increased in most regions.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are at an all time high and the IPCC unabashedly pointed the finger at the oil and gas industry. Increased use of coal has halted the gradual push toward decarbonization of the world’s energy supply and, in 2010 the energy industry was responsible for 35 percent of the annual GHG emissions. More broadly, CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes accounted for 78 percent of the total GHG emissions increase between 1970 and 2010. The Panel’s scientists agree that warming will more than likely exceed two degrees – the threshold for dangerous climate change – and that a full reversal in global energy policy is necessary to limit the damage. However, not all change is created equal and the uneven distribution of warming and precipitation patterns makes the creation of a global strategy all the more difficult.

Among the immediate winners are the Arctic nations, namely Russia. It is estimated that the Arctic holds approximately 30 percent of the world’s undiscovered natural gas reserves and 13 percent of the world’s undiscovered oil reserves. Russia is believed to hold over half of the total Arctic resources.

To date, Russia has been the most active in the Arctic, with a number of projects in development in the Barents and Kara seas. Western companies are eager to join and ExxonMobil, Statoil, and Total have already embarked on significant partnerships with state-owned oil and gas giants Rosneft and Gazprom. However, territorial disputes have thus far defined the region’s development: the United States and Canada disagree on the boundaries of the promising Beaufort Sea as well as the legal status of the Northwest Passage; Norway and Russia seemingly ended their 40-year dispute; but Canada and Russia continue to assert their territorial sovereignty all the way to the North Pole.

Extreme conditions, low commodity prices, and sanctions (Russia) have limited total Arctic output. Political debates will likely continue, but the IPCC predicts the conditions will only get easier for oil and gas extraction. By mid-century, the Panel suggests that the Arctic Ocean may be ice-free during the summer months and global glacier volume and permafrost area are projected to decrease by up to 85 and 81 percent respectively. This is a huge boon, especially to North American producers hindered by shorter lease terms. Over the next decade, Arctic investment is expected to reach $100 billion. In the United States, Shell is preparing to return to the Arctic and drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge may resurface.

In a carbon-conscious future, the renewable energy industry is the long-term winner. To maximize dangerous climate change mitigation the IPCC prescribes a renewables share of 80 percent of the power sector by 2050, up from 22 percent today. Moreover, the report suggests that fossil fuel power generation without carbon capture and storage should be phased out almost entirely by 2100. These are difficult goals to meet and generally depend on the willingness of governments across the globe to accept climate change challenges head on, but the renewables industry is well positioned for a leap forward.

As of 2013, renewable electricity generation is on par with that of natural gas. By 2015, solar energy consumption is expected to more than double from 2012 levels along with 39 and 67 percent gains in wind and biodiesel respectively. The European Union is on pace to meet its 20 percent by 2020 agreement and projects particularly large growth in offshore wind and solar. Global investment in renewables is expected to average $230 billion annually to 2020, albeit down from 2011’s peak of $280 billion. Developing nations are increasingly onboard and, in 2013 new renewable capacity surpassed new fossil fuels and nuclear capacity for the first time in China.

The glass is still only half full however, as data shows fossil fuel dependence hasn’t budged. With the IPCC’s report now in hand, policy makers worldwide have their work cut out for them as they prepare for the Paris summit in 2015. Absent any binding agreements, fossil fuels will continue to hamstring renewable energy growth. Of course global climate change poses a great threat to our way of life and any examination of the primary beneficiaries is an entirely subjective matter. We all stand to lose as rising sea levels and rising temperatures displace large populations and affect agricultural processes. An increasingly accessible Arctic does not demand drilling. The IPCC report concludes that ambitious mitigation is compatible with economic growth.

48,48,FL-2014-000154-IDN,Why we need more Metro Buses - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com. - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1142688,"Every other week, barbs are exchanged on TV and criticism is launched in print on the Lahore Bus Rapid Transit Green Line, or as it is commonly called, ""Lahore Metro Bus"".

It has been deemed a failure by the commentariat, a media with a class bias and a troupe of politicians that has no significant interest in and nothing at stake in public transit.

Let us take a holistic look at a project that has been deemed ‘unviable’, ‘running in deficit’ and ‘unaffordable luxury’.

Also read: Just how 'Fit for Purpose' are the Metro bus projects?

The Green Line BRT was inaugurated in February 2013. It has 27 stations along a 27km corridor that stretches from Shahdara to Gajjumata. The capital cost of the project was between Rs29 and Rs34 billion, an exact figure depends on what to include in the project cost as some elements were complementary.

It utilises 64 spacious buses, running on a dedicated right-of-way track (a busway), one third of which is elevated. The stations provide access for the elderly and persons with disabilities; utilise platform doors, GPS-based arrival timings, automatic fare collection and RFID cards to run a smooth system.

A 10km extension to Kala Shah Kaku has already been planned.

In the first year of operation, the total ridership was 43 million. A 42 per cent fleet expansion took place midway through 2013, increasing capacity. Peak daily ridership was 178,850 and the average daily ridership through the first half of 2014 was at 149,228 with a monthly average peak of 159,222. Buses are jam-packed and total ridership this year should be expected to hit 54 million, up 25 per cent, but having reached operational capacity.

A view of Metro Bus from inside the busway.

Operational cost:

The system has an operational budget of Rs2.56 billion. Of that amount, Rs953 million is recovered by the Punjab Metrobus Authority (PMA) from the fares it collects. It requires Rs1.65 billion support from the government, and this can be termed a subsidy.

The largest part of the expense is based on a Rs360/bus/km agreement that the Government of Punjab signed with an operator after a tendering process. The operating company is responsible for the maintenance, the employees and the contract requires high standards for operation to keep the system running well.

Operational cost for the under-construction Rawalpindi-Islamabad BRT is 12.5 per cent lower at Rs 315/km/bus. It could be argued that the government should have aggressively negotiated and kept the price lower, but since this was the lowest bid received, there is not a lot of room for haggling left. The contract is eight years long, with fuel and other cost adjustments, but the initial cost should be a fair benchmark to do calculations on.

Fare-box recovery ratio:

'Fare-box recovery ratio' is a term that refers to the amount of operational expenses that a transit system is able to recover from fares. The Lahore BRT Green Line has a farebox recovery ratio of 37.2 per cent.

When compared across projects and internationally, fare-box recovery ratios can often be misleading as many ‘successful’ transit systems, showing operational profits, generate large parts of their income through non-transit sources.

Delhi Metro for example, continued to generate up to 2/3rd of its income through real estate ventures till a few years ago, and lately generates a significant amount through consultancy on other transit projects in India, as the leading expert in the area.

Same is the case for Hong Kong MTR, which generates almost half a billion dollars annually through real estate.

In the 10 largest US public transit systems, fare-box recovery for bus systems stands at 26.7 per cent and for light rail (a Bus Rapid Transit competitor), at 27.2 per cent. The much respected New York City MTA has a fare-box recovery of 51.2 per cent.

Even for BRT systems, from TransJakarta to Ahmedabad BRTS, subsidies are provided as mobility is a fundamental right and in urban areas, public transit is a vital element in keeping cities livable and affordable.

Feeder routes that help transit become successful are often even free, to encourage people to ride transit. Here is a chart that plots fare-box recovery for the 10 largest US city public transit systems:

For the time being, the fare-box recovery ratio in Lahore is perfectly average, making the Lahore BRT more viable.

Potential advertising revenue:

Currently, the system has no advertising on-board or on the stations. Limited rental income is generated through small ‘tuc shops’, which were opened at select stations recently.

Of the 27km, two-thirds is on ground, fenced from the sides, and providing for a vital income source by being doubled as advertising space.

PHA currently charges Rs1,472,000 for around 180 sq ft of advertising on a moving transport vehicle and Rs1,328 to Rs3,163 per sq ft per month for ‘streamers’ – ads that are hung from poles.

Looking at outdoor advertising rates, and since any ads along the busway will not be at the ideal location that billboards occupy, rates can be expected to be around Rs1,000/sq ft/month. On the fence of the 19km on ground busway section, if 500 advertising spaces of 15x5 ft are leased out at this rate, it will generate Rs450 million.

Ads on buses and stations and more advertising along/under the overhead section, or increased advertising density along the busway, can bring an advertising income of Rs500 million or more easily. This alone will reduce the subsidy by nearly 30 per cent.

Currently, fares are at Rs20. A 50 per cent increase sounds high, but Rs10 is a modest increase on a low fare. Combined, these two will add at least Rs950 million to the revenue and bring fare-box recovery to over 70%. Such a figure should be quite satisfactory.

Design Issues

Like any transit project, there are pros and cons, options to be weighed, and complicated and preferential issues at stake.

Lahore’s Green Line BRT has had many issues too, not least of which was the lack of public engagement in planning, which is a product of bureaucratic mistrust of the people and the 'all-knowing benevolent ruler' governance style.

Even the project’s most enthusiastic supporters have valid criticisms.

The design of the stations and elevators could have been better. Some are not happy with a planned LRT line being converted to a BRT one, even with the government's promise that it may be converted to light-rail one day.

The government should also increase the number of vehicles on the line, perhaps even doubling it, for the near-capacity ridership suggests there is room for expansion.

Another critical issue has been lack of effective feeder routes, something the LTC can provide for.

Moreover, park and ride lots need to be added to critical stations. But these are criticisms aimed at improving a well-functioning system, not half-baked rejections of proven transit solutions or politically biased mudslinging.

Lessons learnt have already been incorporated in the new transit lines planned, with Multan’s planned system consisting of two corridors from the get-go; with ability to have more than two routes on it, and far better designed stations too.

Lahore has plans for multiple BRT lines, at least 2 heavy rail metro lines and plans for an overhead monorail as well.

Misguided criticisms

Some of even the criticism was off the mark, though.

Some people compared costs of widely different projects and missed some points entirely. The capital cost for the line in Lahore was on the higher end because one-third of the track is elevated – a necessity. It was impossible to go through Ichra and other dense, old parts of town at ground level and not eliminate necessary vehicular lanes.

Similarly, the Rawalpindi-Islamabad BRT has a high capital cost because of the extended overhead section and due to future-proofing it for a shift to light-rail use.

Also read: Metro Bus concerns

Some projects like Ahmedabad BRTS are not considered good BRT projects (bronze rated) because they suffer from ‘BRT creep’; where essential elements of a BRT system such as dedicated busway/right-of-way is lost to mixed traffic or fare collection is not off-board. These and other aspects eliminate the crucial aspects that make BRT competitive with light-rail in terms of passenger capacity and speed.

Lahore’s Green Line does have limited mixed traffic issues at a bridge-crossing and the extended portion, where an ITS-signalling system gives the buses priority. But by and large, it meets the gold standard for BRT and is bound to cost higher than ‘cheaper models’.

Many people are comparing a single transit line’s ridership to the city’s entire needs and suggesting that the project is a failure. That is wrong because more than five lines are under plan and on completion, will be carrying significant numbers of passengers.

Some critics did not even bother to read up on the issue before proclaiming that elevated or partially elevated BRT lines do not exist anywhere in the world, and it is only trains that are so. Actually, Xiamen, Chengdu, Amritsar, TransJakarta Corridor 13 and Bandar Sunway’s Sunway Line are all existing or planned BRT lines with completely or partially elevated tracks.

In the case of Rawalpindi-Islamabad, the cities are interconnected, yet broken apart. Islamabad works by utilising the lower middle class and poor people living on its outskirts and in Rawalpindi. And for this workforce, transport options for reaching business areas and offices in Islamabad are terribly limited. Outside of institutional transport in the form of buses provided for employees, there are only wagons; no suitable transport option.

Also read: Islamabad Metro Bus project — where does it stand?

With the dharnas, work on the final terminus of the planned BRT line remains suspended and a vital part of the corridor stands affected. When it opens next January, the BRT line will not end at the planned terminus of Pakistan Secretariat, which employs thousands of lower middle class administrative staff who live in Rawalpindi or in Islamabad’s sectors that the BRT line is going through, but one stop short.

Clearing up some misconceptions

The value of transit projects:

Only 19.5 per cent households in Lahore have access to cars. A further 44.8 per cent have access to a motorcycle. 40 per cent of trips made in Lahore are exclusively pedestrian. Mobility is extremely low compared to other large developing Asian cities, especially for females who make one-fourth the same amount of trips as men (JICA study). Female sections in public transit, just as the existing Green Line has, will free women in the most literal sense of the word.

Whenever a car driver sets out from his or her home, they are using roads paid for by the entire public at large. Land acquisition for these roads; construction; operation and maintenance; never ending expansions and resurfacing; cost of a traffic signalling system; traffic police; carbon emissions and externalities in the form of environmental pollution causing lung related illnesses; reduced productivity; eventually reduced life expectancy and even the urban island effect they create (causing higher energy usage to keep living areas cooler) are all subsidised by the public at large.

Expansive ‘boulevards’ that connect gated housing schemes (DHAs, Bahrias and such) to the city and business districts are developed at an expense to the public, not to mention the urban space they take up, causing socioeconomic and living standard issues.

In comparison, transit brings with itself unparalleled economic revival in the struggling areas it goes through. It creates a boom in commercial, residential and business activity. This is not a claim but a well-established truth.

What you should know about subsidies:

Across the globe, cars and highways are subsidised far more than transit projects. The public does not usually recognise these subsidies and rather reacts with anger at subsidies provided to mass transit. Nominal tolls on highways and motorways, or annual car registration taxes don’t cover costs, but give the driver a false sense of doing so. It is not convenient to ask every car driver to pay a toll for the exact capital and O&M cost for their drive everyday. Yet, we expect transit riders to pay the entire operational expense of their commute at the gate.

Punjab collected just over Rs9 billion as Motor Vehicle Tax last year and another Rs1.3 billion in highway tolls, but had to spend over Rs33 billion in maintenance and construction of roads in the province. There is additional federal highways and motorways spending in the region and significant spending by local authorities (LDA, RDA, FDA, other Municipal Corporations and TMAs) to keep the roads maintained. Even provincial spending alone would suggest a comparable ‘fare-box recovery’ of 31 per cent, and a real figure would be around 10 per cent or so.

Transit recovers a greater share of operational expenses directly. Upfront capital costs can be daunting, but often not too high in comparison to highway projects.

For a comparison of capital costs, the planned Malir River Expressway is estimated to cost over Rs60 billion (as of two years ago). While it will provide heavy traffic to bypass the city, primary beneficiaries will also include car-dependent residents of DHA City, Bahria Town and other suburban housing societies that are being developed in the north.

The existing BRT line in Lahore is getting subsidies that are perfectly in line with global averages. It’s reliance on the public kitty can be reduced by utilising advertising potential and raising the ridership numbers even more. But it is critical and perfectly normal for publicly run mass transit systems to expect a significant support in recovering operational cost.

Pakistan has always subsidised its salaried class in everything from housing to gymkhana clubs to specialised higher education. Petrol remained heavily subsidised until very recently, and the working class wasn’t burning petrol in their non-existent cars. Piped gas is still not available to all. Electricity subsidies have been reduced only in the last five years. Energy subsidies in the hundreds of billions annually largely went to the upwardly mobile middle classes.

Today, the government continues to provide subsidy to the amount of Rs2.5 million per medical student, only to be helping add ‘value’ to the marketability of girls as wives in some cases (patriarchal culture and society being responsible).

Subsidies for the working class should not even be controversial, especially when it’s equal to 660 female medical students not joining the workforce after studying on the public kitty (there are over 18,000 medical college students in Punjab, 12,000 of them females, with the vast majority in public colleges).

In comparison to car drivers, transit riders in the developing world tend to the working class, the poor who have limited commute choices. Their economic opportunities remain confined due to many factors, mobility being a primary one. Unlike white-collar upper middle class persons living in an affluent suburban housing scheme, the job option for the working class is often limited by place of residence and inability to reach areas where they work.

You can't pick-and-choose when serving the working class:

When working multiple jobs a day, this becomes even more problematic, especially when industrial estates are not linked via public transit.

Reliable transit that connects dense residential areas to commercial, business and industrial areas provide these people with the ability to provide for their families. They are able to go out further and become employed at places they could not have reached before.

Education and health are of course important. But this is not a pick-and-choose, either/or issue. It is important to provide better education, effective healthcare and ensure livable cities at the same time. These choices are not made in isolation. Sure, transit projects or infrastructure development shouldn’t be prioritised above all other things, but neither should they keep getting ignored and the working class left to fend for themselves.

It takes two hours for people who have been relocated to Surjani Town (for construction of the Lyari Expressway in Karachi) to reach areas where they often work. Their struggles and destruction of life goes ignored. If financed through government-to-government or IFC equivalent loans, these projects are extremely affordable over 10-15 year payment periods, with their benefits far outweighing and outpaying the costs.

Pakistan will continue to see increasing urbanisation. The larger cities are seeing sharp population increases. In order to cater for such large urban areas, the only solution is effective public transit. There is no space to spare for cars or even motorcycles anymore.

Transit, on the other hand, will enable larger cities to become livable and adapt for a future before the future becomes unbearable.","Thu, 06 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.dawn.com/large/2014/11/545b5e566f9ef.jpg,"['lahore', 'recovery', 'transit', 'line', 'class', 'brt', 'cent', 'bus', 'buses', 'public', 'cost', 'metro', 'need']",

ByRepeating what he had said last September, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong cautioned that Singaporeans should “always know that somebody can take your lunch away.”Mr Lee was speaking at the Forbes Global CEO Conference at the Shangri-La Hotel on Tuesday.Last September, Mr Lee had cautioned Singaporeans against foreigners who would “steal your lunch”.“If you look at other countries – Vietnam, China, even in India, they’re not talking about work-life balance; they are hungry, anxious, about to steal your lunch. So I think I’d better guard my lunch,” he had said.At Tuesday’s dialogue, Mr Lee was asked by Steve Forbes, Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of Forbes Media LLC, what was next for Singapore after its 50year of independence.Mr Lee’s reply was [emphasis added]:

Mr Lee’s remarks are in contrast to what he said six months ago – in April – in an interview with the Financial Times.

Then, he was asked by interviewer, Gideon Rachman, “if Singaporeans still need to feel insecure”, given that “Singapore has enjoyed a long period of peace and ever-rising prosperity and now has one of the highest per-capita GDPs in the world.”

Mr Lee’s response then was [emphasis added]:

“Singaporeans generally feel more secure these days… One of our tasks is to remind them that this a result of a continuing act of will and an appropriate sense of insecurity is very helpful. You don’t have to be paranoid but you do have to take risks very seriously.”

So, which is which?

It is interesting that Mr Lee uses the word “paranoid” to urge Singaporeans to be on guard against global situations, or to be prepared for competition.

Perhaps this goes back to his description of his Government as a “Paranoid Government” in 2007 [pic, right], when he explained his Government’s decision to raise the salaries of ministers and civil servants.

The TODAY newspaper reported Mr Lee:

“The Singapore model is a paranoid one because it prides itself on being ‘totally committed’ to improving the lives of Singaporeans, said Mr Lee, who explained that the decision to increase the salaries of ministers and civil servants now was to ‘produce the best Government’ for all.”

And what is all this paranoia for?

Ironically, it is so that Singaporeans can have “peace of mind for the future”, as Mr Lee said in his National Day Rally speech this year, when he “reiterated the Government’s commitment to give Singaporeans the assurance and peace of mind for the future.”

Perhaps what Mr Lee meant by being “paranoid” is what academic Parag Khanna described as “strategic paranoia” in December last year.

Singapore’s economic success can be attributed to the country being “strategically paranoid”, the Straits Times reported him as having said then.

Mr Parag had also described the “labour movement’s mantra of ‘cheaper, better, faster’, urging companies and workers to become more productive, [as] one example of strategic paranoia”, for example.

Whether it is plain paranoia or “strategic paranoia”, what is clear is that Singaporeans in general, by various social indicators, seem to be straining in their daily lives – from being worried about inflation rates to competition from foreigners for jobs, from working long hours and being stressed at work to not having time for family.

And the consequences of Mr Lee’s Government flooding the island with foreigners – who now make up 40 per cent of Singapore’s total population – along with the projected 6.9 million population figure by 2030, have not helped make Singaporeans feel better either.

It also doesn’t really help that the Government’s messaging seems to confuse as well – one moment telling Singaporeans they “do not have to be paranoid” and the next telling them exactly the opposite.

But first things first: perhaps what would be helpful is to first understand what paranoia is, before we all get carried away fearing shadows when there might be none.

Kolkata: Two Navy warships, which were scheduled to be berthed at Khidderpore dock here till November 7 for public visits, were today withdrawn to the sea for undisclosed 'operational reasons,' a Defence Ministry official said.

The recall of warships INS Khukri and INS Sumitra came in the backdrop of an alert by central intelligence agencies to the Kolkata police about the possibility of a terror attack in the city, especially in the port area.

Asked whether the recall of ships is due to the terror alert by central intelligence agencies, Defence CPRO Group Captain T K Singha said ""no, it has nothing to do with any terror alert. The recall of ships is strictly due to operational reasons.""

A Defence press statement issued here said ""the alacrity by which Indian warships are ready for operation at a short notice was demonstrated by the quick turnaround of the two visiting warships - INS Khukri and INS Sumitra - which had just berthed at Kidderpore yesterday, amply showcasing Indian Navy's prompt readiness as the two warships are set to sail out within hours of a recall to the sea for undisclosed 'operational reasons' on orders by Eastern Naval Command HQ, today.""

According to the statement, the warships were scheduled to berth here till Friday, enabling the public visit the ships on Wednesday and Thursday.

Earlier in the day, a senior Kolkata police official said ""we have received inputs from central intelligence agencies that there might be a terror attack in Kolkata, especially in the port area.

52,52,FL-2014-000154-IDN,In Fashion: A Vogue reality - Newspaper - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1142897,"Directly catering to the staggering $275 billion fashion industry, fashion weeks are now a global phenomenon. It is said that, at any given time, there are 32 fashion weeks happening around the globe. Still, the business of fashion at such weeks remains far from perfect.

Whether fashion weeks fall short of achieving their targeted goals is a discussion for another day and time. For now, there are a host of other activities taking place as a result of interesting partnerships that effectively serve the purpose of forwarding the cause of fashion with a purpose. One such three-day activity that occurred last week in Dubai’s downtown district which attracted the leading names in fashion, world media and fashionistas was the second edition of the Vogue Fashion Dubai Experience (VFDE 2014) — the brainchild of Emaar Properties and Editor-in-Chief of Vogue Italia, Franca Sozzani.

Embedded in the event’s DNA is the promotion of young, new designers. This was done through a painstaking process of sifting through the portfolios of thousands of hopefuls and narrowing the search down to 28 promising new talent, featuring their Spring/Summer collections and accessories such as jewellery, shoes and handbags. The event kicked off with a press conference addressed by Mrs Sozzani along with Robert Booth, CEO Emaar Dubai Real Estate and Member of Dubai Design and Fashion Council and Abdallah Alwardt, Dubai Director of the World Food Programme. This was followed by a Q&A session, a fashion catwalk featuring the S/S collections of eight designers at the snazzy Fashion Avenue at The Dubai Mall, a tour of the fashion exhibits, the International Talents Showcase at the Armani Hotel Dubai Ballroom and lectures by Mrs Sozzani (Suzy Menkes could not attend due to a family tragedy), Peter Dundas of the Emilio Pucci fashion house, designer Philipp Plein, Alberta Ferretti, Roberto Cavalli and Sara Maino, and the usual red carpet activity.

Human nature tends to be the same irrespective of where you are on the planet. There are marked similarities in the issues faced by the fashion industry in Pakistan and those that occur at the world’s fashion capitals. Many of the issues touched upon by the speakers at VFDE 2014 are also confronted by fashion designers, organisers and others directly related to Pakistan’s fashion industry.

Attending the Vogue Fashion Dubai Experience 2014 at the prestigious Dubai Mall has been quite an eye-opening experience, writes Faisal Quraishi

Here, Images on Sunday takes a look at these issues and their relevance in context to Pakistan.

The designers with Franca Sozzani (C) and Robert Booth

Young talent, women empowerment and global hunger

“We don’t need another Armani, we need new blood. We want to attract brand sponsorship for young talent. We want to support the younger, global generation of designers and Dubai is the best place to start and share our knowledge. Twenty new designers from the world over with really good talent will have the chance to show what they are doing. We have also given a voice to women designers in order for them to be heard and to give them back their dignity through work.”

Besides being the Editor-in-Chief of Vogue Italia since 1988, Mrs Sozzani is the World Food Programme’s Global Ambassador against Hunger. She is also the appointed Goodwill Ambassador for Fashion 4Development, an organisation that empowers women through fashion business. She is ranked as one of the 100 most powerful women in the world by Time Magazine.

Abdallah Alwardt, Dubai Director of the World Food Programme said that together they reach out to 90 million people worldwide, especially in drought-hit African countries, and proceeds from the VFDE 2014 will go towards their school-feeding programme.

One hopes a dominating personality like Sozzani’s makes its presence felt in Pakistani fashion (the powerful Lahore-based PFDC Chairperson Sehyr Saigol comes to mind here) on similar lines, along with fashion activity that works towards a specific cause, like a part of the funds being donated to charity. And not just benefit shows being held for victims in the wake of natural disasters like earthquakes, floods etc. It may already be too late for many poor souls by then.

From concrete to clothes

“Fashion is a $275 billion industry with fashion capitals such as New York, Milan, London, Paris, etc and now Dubai has also entered this league. Twenty per cent of all luxury sales take place in Dubai and 50 per cent of them happen in the Dubai Mall. It’s the premier international lifestyle retail attraction on the planet visited by over 75 million people in 2014, which makes this city the leading fashion destination in the world working towards luxury brands. We expect 100 million visitors after expansion and it steadily gets bigger.”

When Robert Booth, CEO Emaar Dubai Real Estate and member of Dubai Design and Fashion Council revealed these stats, it seemed strange coming from a real estate tycoon (he was filling in for Chairman, Emaar Properties Mohamed Alabbar who could not attend the opening day press conference due to a prior engagement) who works with construction material. One would ordinarily presume people like him would be immune to the finer sensibilities required for a delicate craft like fashion design. So maybe our very own Malik Riaz, the CEO of Bahria Town, can take cue from Mr Alabbar and strike a strategic partnership with the bigwigs of fashion in Pakistan to hold events that would ultimately lead to the betterment of the image of Pakistan in the global media. It all means good (read increased) business at the end of the day, really!

Roberto Cavalli shared anecdotes on his passion for denim and detailed how the fabric can be integrated into fashionable wear for every occasion, the celebrities he loves to work for and even those who make him nervous. He shared his experiences of designing for Jennifer Lopez and associating with Victoria Beckham and Mary J. Blige.

Fashion tutorials

“If you don’t sell then there’s something wrong with you, not others. We want to create a tutorial project for young designers in order to see beyond culture and tradition and to become more international in their approach to design. There is a place for them here in the Dubai Mall to stock, among other opportunities. It’s the perfect platform to reach out to consumers surrounded by big brands, retail distribution etc.”

Mrs Sozzani’s words ring eerily true. This is exactly what our crop of emerging young designers need to become formidable names in fashion in the near future. Although our fashion councils are working in a similar direction, more effective tutorials are what are needed for them to go well and truly international.

Talk the talk

Franca Sozzani giving a talk on New Generation in Fashion

The well-attended fashion talks by icons and legends such as Franca Sozzani, international Vogue editor Suzy Menkes, leading Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli, Creative Director at Emilio Pucci, Peter Dundas, emerging designer Philipp Plein, designer Alberta Feretti and Senior Editor Vogue Italia and Vogue Talents Sara Maino were a new feature at the VFDE 2014.

Moderated by journalist J.J. Martin, the verbal exchange gave rare insight into the workings of the fashion world, as well as the sharing of invaluable experiences by industry professionals. It also gave a break to the attendants from ramp shows and exhibits that filled up their daily schedule.

While Suzy Menkes could not attend due to a personal tragedy, Mrs Sozzani’s topic of discussion was ‘New Generation in Fashion’ in which she also briefly touched upon the rivalry that exists between fashion capitals (In our case that would be between Karachi and Lahore).

Peter Dundas’ ‘Heritage Moving Forward’ dealt with him taking up the position of Creative Director at Pucci and giving it a new vision and sense of direction in a fast-changing, modern world. ‘Excess/Success’ by Philipp Plein saw the designer defy family to become a formidable force in fashion, all with the creation of a single handbag made from some leftover leather from a sofa upholstery.

Alberta Feretti spoke a lot of sense while tackling the self-explanatory ‘The Strength of Tradition’ as did Roberto Cavalli with ‘From Denim to Red Carpet’. Cavalli shared anecdotes on his passion for denim and detailed how the fabric can be integrated into fashionable wear for every occasion, the celebrities he loves to work for and even those who make him nervous. He shared his experiences of designing for Jennifer Lopez and associating with Victoria Beckham and Mary J. Blige.

Sara Maino’s ‘Scouting New Talent’ dealt with seeing through all the clutter to recognise true talent that will shine through either on the ramp, a fashion glossy cover or editorial spread. She advised emerging designers to “be very clear of what you want to do.”

All said and done, we need our veteran brigade of stylists, designers, and fashion critics etc to come forth and work along these very lines to educate newcomers and make fashion activity a more meaningful exercise.

Fashion for everyone

Designer Roberto Cavalli at the red carpet

“Fashion is art applicable. The focus still remains on creativity and affordability so that everyone can afford and wear designer brands. The rest is up to business. If it was not for creativity we would still be dressed like in the ’80s!”

While answering a question about the magic of couture being compromised, Franca Sozzani said that they are not going a minimalist way but a free way. This discussion rages on in the fashion avenues of Pakistan as well, with people claiming that couture is dying out with the increasing popularity of pret. We may have the official version from Mrs Sozzani for now but the floor still remains open for debate.

Waiting in the wings

“The criteria for VFDE designers is that we choose designers from all over the world while giving preference to creativity.”

The inclusion of a good smattering of designers from countries such as India, Indonesia, South Korea, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine, Lithuania and Lebanon; besides the UK, USA, Canada, France/Germany, Italy, Hungary and Australia shows that the criteria for selection was fairly transparent. Then why was there no representation from Pakistan? Surely we too have ample reserves of promising young talent and all that’s needed is a slight nudge and push in the right direction.

Things should change in this context by next year when the VFDE promises to become even bigger and better. Hope all the new fashion talent is listening out there for we have certainly got what it takes!

Early to bed, early to rise

And finally onto the most relevant of all issues: the VFDE 2014 itinerary clearly stated an early morning commencement of events (as early as 11am) working its way through lunch and then an early end so that the participants could enjoy their evenings and have a timely dinner.

In Pakistan however, the exact opposite holds true where all such events are considered a social exercise by fashionistas to be participated in while remaining close to their true nature and not risking any exposure whatsoever to the sun: breakfast is only good well past 12 noon, lunch should coincide with supper and dinner should be indulged in only after the day’s engagements are away and done with — the only trouble is that this may be well after 2am! What say of holding or attending fashion events?

Photo Courtesy M. Srinath, The Hindu

No, the man pictured here has not entered the gutter as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s much hyped Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, or “clean India campaign”. Unlike the ad rush that shows posing with the broom, he could not have entered the gutter to preach the country about the virtues of cleanliness.

He is, in fact, indulging in a practice outlawed time and again by both the legislature and the judiciary of the country, most recently on March 27 this year. The Supreme Court had outlawed manual scavenging yet again and ordered all state governments to strictly enforce the provisions of Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act passed by Indian parliament in 2013. Yet the practice continues as exposed by this photograph taken by M. Srinath of The Hindu in Chennai, not some nondescript village tucked away in remote areas.

Furthermore, this is not the only picture to expose the failure it illustrates. There is hardly a day without news of manual scavengers dying of asphyxiation in gutters across the nation. Last time we reported a case from Hyderabad. Before that it happened in Surendranagar in Gujarat. Earlier still, was a case from Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of the Prime Minister. These are only the cases that make it into the media. There is hardly any data on such deaths, but activist S. Anand estimates that at least 22,337 persons engaged in some kind of sanitation work die in India every year; 1 to 2 of them literally dying in gutters every day.

Going by the law and Supreme Court order, the administration must be completely aware of these deaths. The Supreme Court had banned entering manholes completely unless in acute emergencies. It had further made written approval of the chief executive officer (or whatever name the head of the civic body goes by) mandatory in those emergencies. It had also ordered that such persons should be provided with full protective equipment.

The picture shows how earnestly the state governments are following the order in the capital cities, leaving us to imagine how bad it must be further out of view. The man appears bare bodied, though he must at least be carrying a rod not visible in the photo. That is all he has, no mask to protect him from the poisonous gases that fill these death traps. He is not tied with a protective rope that could be used to pull him out in case he loses conscious; instead his comrades will be forced to enter the same death trap to pull him out and risk dying themselves. Yes, that is the recurring narrative of deaths in several stories in the media. “Two safai karamcharis die while cleaning manhole” was a Times of India headline on April 18, 2011, “Sanitation workers die in septic tank” was The Hindu’s on January 16 this year.

There is no dearth of news about workers dying in manholes, but one can hardly find any on the follow up. Search the archives of the media houses or internet; dying from a lighting strike seems more likely than finding punishment for those guilty for such deaths. This is despite the Supreme Court having fixed the command responsibility for such deaths with the chief executive officer. There are many reasons behind the clear disdain for the lives of manual scavengers as well as for the Supreme Court order that these cases exemplify, but India’s rotten criminal justice system is one of the most significant.

Almost completely inaccessible and unaffordable for the poor while having a decades long backlog of cases, who in his right senses would think of approaching the courts seeking remedy? What are the chances of one getting justice even if he is adamant enough to try? In many of such cases the administration begins with shirking off their responsibility. They often begin by feigning ignorance about the employer, about the victim and even about the work, as they did in the case of death of Pawan, a sanitation worker in Varanasi. (Link Here) They will often assert that it was not they but private citizens who employed the victim. The question is: who is responsible if they are not? Contracting out the work is routine in these neoliberal times but can the principal employer so easily avoid its responsibilities in the eventuality of serious harm to a worker? How can they give work to such agencies or contractors and simply claim that they do not even know whom they employ? And finally, providing sanitation services is the responsibility of the state, isn’t it?

It is time the judiciary wakes up to follow up its own orders as the executive has proved that it will not, at least not for the manual scavengers. The executive perhaps does not need them, a tiny community with very small numbers and therefore dispensable in the first past the post democratic system. They will keep having their missions to moon and mars as those appear to the upwardly mobile middle class, (nothing wrong about that per se), but no need for investment in sanitation. For the uninitiated, in most Indian cities less than 40% of their total population have meaningful access to sanitation services, but then who cares when the community is forced by caste system, , to clean there filth; a striking example of the regressive structure on which progressive idea of Indian democracy rests.

And the filth in the gutters is not the only danger. As per National Human Rights Commssion’s own admission the country has 794390 dry latrines where human excreta is cleaned manually. It had also admitted that adding to these are 1314652 toilets where the human excreta is flushed in open drains. The cleanliness campaign has, expectedly, not addressed them.

This is why the judiciary should start taking suo moto notice of such cases and prosecute the chief executive officers of the responsible civic body; establishing command responsibility makes no sense unless it prosecutes and punishes the officers, thus creating a deterrent. It must also ensure that the compensation is given immediately in cases of death. not the victims.

Until then one can have all the cleanliness campaigns one wants and pose with shiny, brand new brooms. Eradicating manual scavenging requires political will which was not there in earlier regimes and is even less expected from the new ones: our Prime Minister once called manual scavenging a “spiritual” experience. Given that, now is the time for the Supreme Court to act.

Stop making personal attacks – Dr Reddy

Minister for Education Dr Mahendra Reddy

Minister for Education Dr Mahendra Reddy said the Veiuto Primary School Parents and Teachers Association Chairperson Selina Kuruleca should stop making personal attacks and withdraw the letter she had written to him before they can have a meeting.

Doctor Reddy said his stand is clear that the government gives $250 per child per year to all primary schools, and clear justification has to be made to show that some schools need much more than that amount.

Kuruleca had also said that they want an urgent audience with the Minister.

Dr Reddy said he is willing to meet with any parent, however, they should not make any personal attacks like calling people in the Ministry dictators.

When questioned on the personal attacks and whether the Association will withdraw the letter, Kuruleca said this was a personal letter to the Minister and they will not make any comments on it.

His statement follows comments by Selina Kuruleca who questioned the Ministry’s decision to cancel the school’s Fun Day fundraising activity this Saturday and that Veiuto needs more than $390 per child per year to run the school with all the services.

Kuruleca said they would also like to discuss the issue on whether the government can give an additional $150 per child on top of the $250.

Another option is asking the parents to pay for the shortfall.

Kuruleca said Veiuto had asked for $80 per child as school user pay levy early this year.

This has resulted in the school getting $250 per child from the government and $80 school user pay levy from the parents for 2014.

The total amount received per child is $330.

She said this is now insufficient as the cost of providing other services like - provision of exercise books, swimming classes, payment of handymen and groundsmen, insurance for children relating to accidents in schools and provision of sanitary bins for senior girls - are not included in the school grants given by the Education Ministry.

A particular house in Veiuto Primary School was asking parents for a further levy of $80 per family for the school’s Fun Day this Saturday.

The issue was raised with the Ministry for Education after some parents raised concern that they are being asked to pay $80 levy even though the government has said that tuition will be free.

The Minister has also ordered that the Fun Day levy collected should be returned to the parents.

Dr Reddy said every school knows that they should not place any levy on students or their parents without proper approval.

Dr Reddy confirmed that the school should not go ahead with any fundraising activities.

Under the 2014 National Budget, every primary school receives $250 per child per year.","Thu, 30 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.fijivillage.com/news_images/1614874315451cbdb34f78020fedb3.jpg,"['veiuto', 'schools', 'making', 'school', 'reddy', 'stop', 'primary', 'parents', 'personal', 'attacks', 'levy', 'dr', 'child']",

“It is an issue of fundamental human rights. There is an immense need for the international community to unite and raise a voice against the brutality,” said Rehman Anwer, an interfaith and peace activist currently working for an international NGO in London.

PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari made a charged-up appearance at the rally. His enthusiasm though was not responded to in kind. The PPP’s political slogan ‘Jeay Bhutto’, which encapsulates the legacy of the party, ruffled quite a few feathers as he stood on the stage next to his sister Aseefa Bhutto, his security team trying to control the chaos around. The crowds of people were against supporting an individual party and made it clear that they were here for Kashmir and not for political reasons.

Some angry protesters expressed their dissent through pointed verbal attacks while others resorted to hurling plastic bottles at the young party leader. The slogan became a sore point for those who saw it as an attempt by a political party to usurp a cause that had a different agenda.

“I was surprised to see Bilawal because I did not expect a political angle to the struggle as it is all about Kashmiris. When he came he started saying ‘Jeay Bhutto’, which irked the people as there is mass protest in Pakistan against traditional politics at the moment,” said Anwer.

With the men exceeding the number of women at the rally, most were from Mirpur and Srinagar. “I think it should have been purely a human rights based protest,” said Anwer. “No Pakistani politics should be involved in this.” He gave the example of Scotland, where recently a referendum was held on independence. “We should learn from this example and let people decide what they want. Kashmir should decide on its own.”

This point was addressed by Lord Nazir Ahmed, member of the British House of Lords, during his speech to supporters at Trafalgar Square. “We have a political, moral responsibility. If a referendum is good enough for Scotland, then let the international community support Kashmir,” he said to a cheering crowd.

With his arms and hands wrapped in chains, Yasir Gilani from Muzaffarabad and now a trainee solicitor in London was vocal about wanting India to leave Kashmir. “We are not free, we are controlled by India by force and are in chains, and that is what I am symbolising today,” he said.

Born and raised in England, Zulekha Husain from Mirpur, whose grandparents are from Kashmir, waited eagerly to walk to 10 Downing Street along with her cousins and aunts.“Here in England, Pakistanis are three per cent of the population but Kashmiris are two per cent, so we are the majority. We want to stand in solidarity with them to show they are not alone,” she said. The march, which had a Facebook page and used the #KashmirMillionMarch hashtag, did not use the social media as the main method to galvanise people, though. “This came together at the last minute. Former AJK prime minister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry went from town to town, so this was really based on word of mouth,” she said. “I feel Indians are less concerned about this issue than us because they are more integrated into the British society than us.”

With the Indian media reporting the gathering at Trafalgar Square as having been in the hundreds only, Chaudhry maintained this was the biggest gathering for Kashmir’s independence movement and said the march was going to make history.

At the recent United Nations General Assembly, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif brought up the issue of the Kashmiri people who have lived under years of occupation and without fundamental human rights. His Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, expressed engagement in bilateral talks but prior to the recent march, Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj publicly asked the British to halt the “anti-India” rally.

The demonstration in London looked like the start of a campaign to internationalise the Kashmir issue at a time when the Indian prime minister is trying to change the constitutional status of India-held Kashmir. It was an impressive show but it may take the Kashmiri diaspora more than one demonstration to make Western powers take their cause seriously.

More than a dozen natural disasters are on the list, each one interpreted as God’s violent response to the existence of LGBTI people or the growing acceptance of same-sex marriage. Also on the list are various murders and massacres, somehow attributed to gays who weren’t on the scene, along with some surprising accusations, such as gays’ alleged responsibility for the existence of autism and the size of Spain’s national debt.

Regarding Ebola, the Liberian Council of Churches declared that God was punishing the nation with the disease because God was angry over Liberians’ corruption and immoral acts such as homosexuality.

New Delhi: Goa-based mining company Timblo Private Limited, named by the Centre in an affidavit for allegedly stashing blackmoney in foreign banks, is already being probed for charges of money laundering by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a mining scam case.

Sources said the agency has issued summons to the firm and its directors sometime back after it registered a criminal case in the Rs 35,000-crore Goa illegal mining scam in the beach state, which was earlier investigated by the MB Shah Commission for alleged large-scale irregularities.

“The company is one among many in the state being probed by the agency in the illegal mining money laundering case.

They have been issued preliminary notices for want of documents,” an agency source said.

The list submitted by the central government in the Supreme Court yesterday mentioned the name of the firm and its directors Radha Satish Timblo, Chetan S Timblo, Rohan S Timblo, Anna C Timblo and Mallika R Timblo.

However, it was not clear whether the account holder is the company or its directors.

Reacting to these developments, Radha Timblo today said she had “no undisclosed bank account abroad”.

“My conscience is very clear. We have paid all the taxes. We have no undisclosed bank accounts in India or abroad,” she said in Panaji.

Officials said ED has asked the company to furnish details of the business operations and their financial transactions over the last few years as it looks to take the probe further in this mining case.

ED had in June registered a complaint under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after taking cognisance of the reports of the Commission, the inquiry boards constituted in this regard and also an FIR filed by Goa police's Crime Branch last year in August.

New Delhi: Messaging app WhatsApp has rolled out a small but significant feature that tells you when the recipient has read your message. Two little gray check marks that appear next to your message will now turn blue when your text has been read.

Earlier users believed that the grey check marks in WhatsApp meant that the receiver had read their message, but it was not the case, as it meant your message has been sent and delivered to the recipient's device.

If you are interested in knowing at the exact time someone read your message, you can hold down the message, then click info to get time stamps.

WhatsApp has also updated its FAQ pages titled ""How can I tell if someone has read my message?"" and ""What are those check marks next to my messages?""

In addition to the read receipts, WhatsApp has also rolled out the Message Info screen that now displays details of a message. The FAQ page notes, ""For any message that you send, you will be able to see a Message Info screen, displaying the details of when your message was delivered, read or played by the recipient(s)."" Users can check Message Info by tapping and holding a sent message.

Meanwhile reports suggest that a site named Droidapp.nl has received images of the Voice-Calling feature of WhatsApp that is expected to be released in 2015. The site has posted icons for missed calls, start call, end call, incoming and outgoing calls, and new call from an Android app. The publication has also shared a tone it claims will be the dial tone for WhatsApp.

WhatsApp recently announced a delay in its plan of introducing the free voice-calling feature this year, pushing back the launch to the first quarter of 2015.

Medininagar: Former Jharkhand Assembly Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari today held BJP responsible for the ‘poor' condition of the mineral rich state which lagged behind on the developmental front.

Of the 14 years of creation of Jharkhand, the BJP was in power for 10 years and it should accept its failure, Namdhari, an Independent leader, told reporters.

He, however, admitted that there was a wave in favour of Prime Minister Naredra Modi and BJP in the coming Assembly election in Jharkhand.

The state needed a stable and accountable government to move fast on the track of development, the former Lok Sabha member said.

“Jharkhand had paid dearly due to political instability and experiment of coalition government during the last 14 years.

It is now an opportunity for us to elect a strong and accountable government to achieve all round development,” he said referring to the five-phase Assembly polls beginning November 25.

Namdhari had announced earlier that he would not contest elections any more but would remain active in politics to serve the people with his experience.

New Delhip: Actor Harshad Chopra, best known for his roles in “Left Right Left” and ""Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil"", admits his reel life has impacted his real life, but he cannot pinpoint any one change.

“I have actually forgotten what changes came because those changes have become a part of my lifestyle now,"" he said when asked how life changed since he became an actor.

""In real life, I try to be a little disciplined. That is the most difficult part being an actor because we shoot at odd hours. It's like if I am not working, I miss work now,” Harshad told IANS.

The 31-year-old is back on the small screen as Sahir Chaudhary in TV show “Humsafars” and says his character is somebody who is disappointed from life.

""He hates showing his emotions. The only place he gets happiness is at his work. He is very particular and possessive about his work,"" added the actor.

Also seen in shows like “Tere Liye”, “Dharampatni” and “Amber Dhara”, Harshad's motto is to pick characters that are different from each other.

“Every time I come onscreen, I feel that there should be something different about me. God has been kind and I think somewhere the effort I have put in to do or achieve this change has been rewarded by god,” he said.

He also believes in doing one show at a time and added: ""There is a certain amount of commitment that is required. To bring a change in a character, you can't do too many things at a time.""

Chennai: Just a few weeks ago, a small, independent Telugu film called ""Paathshala"" released in cinemas by defying shackles of the industry. Not only was it appreciated by film buffs and critics alike, it also reintroduced independent style filmmaking amidst commercial cinema.

""Paathshala"", according to its director Mahi V. Raghav, ""is the journey of a few youngsters beyond college campus"".

""It's a coming-of-age story that explores friendship beyond the walls of a campus,"" Raghav told IANS.

The director says he decided to make an independent film because ""you can tell the story you want to without any compromises. Nobody is going to ask you to change anything"".

Raghav co-produced the film with a few friends. The reason he didn't find a producer is because it's a road film.

""Nobody even expressed interest to read my script. A few of us chipped in an equal amount to produce 'Paathshala'. Like every other independent film, this also got made by the contribution of a few people,"" said Raghav, who used to work in New Zealand before shifting base to Hyderabad to make films few years ago.

""I think road films are very new to even Indian cinema. It's time to tell different stories and use different narrative styles. People are travelling to several places, so why won't they like to watch a film in which the characters are travelling,"" he asked.

But road films don't come cheap.

""Road films cost a lot more than any independent film in terms of effort and logistics as well. To find a location, carry equipment to shoot and then move the entire cast will definitely cost a lot. In an average film, there will be about 30 to 40 locations, but a road film features easily about 100,"" he said.

""More than 90 percent of the film is shot outdoors, so there's always the risk of rain playing a spoilsport or public being a nuisance and there are several other factors too,"" he added.

""Paathshala"" mostly featured newcomers. And the decision was made purely based on economics.

""If I want better actors, I knew it would cost me more and with what we can afford, we roped in newcomers. We also wanted actors to work on long schedules for about four to five months. With popular stars, it's highly impossible and since the film is a multi-starrer, we would've had issues with screen time had we cast stars,"" said Raghav.

Newcomers Nandu, Sirisha, Anu Priya, Sai Kiran and Shiva essayed the lead roles.

""We spent about six months to finalise the cast. They were enrolled into an acting workshop. For a 70-day shoot, we had spent about eight months on pre-production,"" he said.

Raghav is ""creatively satisfied"" that the film ""was not just appreciated by critics alone but even by common audiences"".

""But there were other factor such as the limited theatrical release of the film. We could only manage to get one or two shows in the multiplexes and the timing of these shows were again the distributor's call,"" he said.

""Unless you know how you're going to distribute a film, there's no point making it,"" he stated.

Raghav desperately hopes for a miracle to happen in the Telugu film industry.

""I did my education in Chennai. In Tamil cinema, both commercial films as well as independent cinema co-exist. People there watch 'Singam' and also films like 'Soodhu Kavvum' and 'Goli Soda'. There seems to be a system being followed as most stars only release their films during festivals and that gives smaller films a window to get released,"" he said.

""In Telugu, we've had diverse films working over the years. In the recent past, entertainment has become comedy. It's become a norm for even exhibitors to buy a film.

Master Chief has been a pretty busy Spartan since blasting onto the Xbox in 2001.

He’s saved the universe a few times, spawned a New York Times best-selling series of books, and has caught the eye of heavyweights like Ridley Scott and Steven Spielberg. Next up is the Nov. 11 release of Halo: The Master Chief Collection, a compilation of the four main Halo games along with a ton of extra goodies.

Halo’s a universe full of mysteries, though. As you get ready to step into Chief’s extremely heavy boots, brush up on your Halo trivia.



1. Steve Jobs debuted it.

Master Chief has shilled for Microsoft for so long that it’s easy to forget that, in the beginning, he was an equal opportunity fanboy.

In its early years, Halo maker Bungie developed games simultaneously for both Mac and PC. Apple CEO Steve Jobs was so taken by the work on Halo that he trotted the game out onstage during the 1999 MacWorld Expo — the first time the game was shown publicly.

Unfortunately, his joy wouldn’t last long. The following year, Microsoft bought Bungie, converted Halo into an Xbox launch title, and made Jobs furious.

2. It didn’t start off as a shooter.

These days Halo is synonymous with console first-person shooters, but it didn’t start out as one.

Before the Xbox was in the picture, Bungie had envisioned Halo as a real-time strategy game. It later moved into the action genre, becoming a third-person cooperative game (complete with a flamethrower and spear gun) before evolving into the Halo we know today. Want to see the pre-Xbox build?

3. It’s been confused with the U.N.

Running a 24-hour news desk can’t be easy, but the fact checkers for the BBC blew it big-time in 2012 during a story about Syria.

While discussing actions taken by the United Nations Security Council, the network accidentally used a logo for a different UNSC — the United Nations Space Command from Halo. To be fair, a few Spartan soldiers would make pretty good peacekeepers.

4. The UNSC is full of Real American Heroes™.

One of the first voices you hear in Halo: Combat Evolved should sound familiar if you’ve listened to the radio since the late 1990s. Captain Jacob Keyes of the UNSC is voiced by Pete Stacker, whose ridiculous readings of Budweiser’s Real American Heroes/Real Men of Genius commercials made them so successful that the beer company eventually released a CD of the ads.

Story continues

5. Cortana and Princess Peach are BFFs.

Halo’s helpful Cortana and Nintendo’s perpetually kidnapped Princess Peach aren’t much alike, which makes it all the more impressive that the same person voices the two characters.

Not only does Jen Taylor give voice to Master Chief’s digital pal, but Microsoft loved her so much in the role that it brought her on to do the voice of the digital assistant for Windows Phone, too.

6. Master Chief is also a DJ.

The hero of Halo isn’t particularly social. He’s a man of few words, his best friend is a computer A.I., and he spends most of his time wandering around alone. So it’s especially hard to picture him grooving to Creedence Clearwater Revival.

But Steve Downes digs some CCR, that’s for sure. The man who gives Master Chief his voice is a DJ on WDRV (“The Drive”) in Chicago. Downes was one of several Chicago-area voice actors Bungie hired when it began casting the original Halo. He took the job but didn’t give it much thought until he was visiting a friend in Florida and kids swarmed him, Flood-like, for an autograph.

7. He’s also old enough to be your father (maybe).

He’s strong enough to wander the universe in a 1,000-pound suit, but according to Halo lore, Master Chief is no spring chicken. Having started out fighting the Covenant when he was only 14, Chief is now well into his 40s. Watch your back, Chief. Seriously, watch it. Use your core.

8. Its music owes a debt to Fred and Wilma.

Marty O’Donnell’s soundtrack is as much a part of the Halo franchise as Master Chief. But before he crossed paths with Bungie (a relationship that ended badly earlier this year), O’Donnell was in the advertising business, writing jingles for commercials — including the iconic one for Flintstones vitamins in the above video. Sorry that’s stuck in your head now.

9. Halo 2’s soundtrack is a wonderland.

In addition to O’Donnell, a few big names contributed to the music of Halo 2. Famed songwriter Nile Rodgers took the lead as producer, bringing in the likes of legendary guitarist Steve Vai to lay down some tracks.

But O’Donnell recently revealed that another guitarist, John Mayer, contributed to two tracks as well, entirely off the books. A huge Halo fan, Mayer apparently just wanted to be able to tell his friends that he was on the soundtrack to Halo 2.

10. It’s a political distraction.

It’s common for gamers to call in sick the day a big game releases, but in the case of Halo 4, it didn’t just upset employers — it upset political activists, too.

Halo 4 was released on Nov. 6, 2012 — the same day voters headed to the polls to hand the keys to the White House to Barack Obama or Mitt Romney. Some feared the excitement over the game would keep younger voters away. It even wound up with its own nickname: “The Halo Effect.”
