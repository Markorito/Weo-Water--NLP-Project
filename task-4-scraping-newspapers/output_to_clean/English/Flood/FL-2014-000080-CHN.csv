Now, new research from Washington University in St. Louis links the river's increasingly deadly floods to a widespread pattern of human-caused environmental degradation and related flood-mitigation efforts that began changing the river's natural flow nearly 3,000 years ago.

""Human intervention in the Chinese environment is relatively massive, remarkably early and nowhere more keenly witnessed than in attempts to harness the Yellow River,"" said T.R. Kidder, PhD, lead author of the study and an archaeologist at Washington University.

""In some ways, these findings offer a new benchmark for the beginning of the Anthropocene, the epoch in which humans became the most dominant global force in nature.""

Forthcoming in the Journal of Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, the study offers the earliest known archaeological evidence for human construction of large-scale levees and other flood-control systems in China.

A catastrophic flood

It also suggests that the Chinese government's long-running efforts to tame the Yellow River with levees, dikes and drainage ditches actually made periodic flooding much worse, setting the stage for a catastrophic flood circa A.D. 14-17, which likely killed millions and triggered the collapse of the Western Han Dynasty.

""New evidence from China and elsewhere show us that past societies changed environments far more than we've ever suspected,"" said Kidder, the Edward S. and Tedi Macias Professor in Arts & Sciences and chair of anthropology at WUSTL. ""By 2,000 years ago, people were controlling the Yellow River, or at least thought they were controlling it, and that's the problem.""

Kidder's research, co-authored with Liu Haiwang, senior researcher at China's Henan Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, relies on a sophisticated analysis of sedimentary soils deposited along the Yellow River over thousands of years.

It includes data from the team's ongoing excavations at the sites of two ancient communities in the lower Yellow River flood plain of China's Henan province.

The Sanyangzhuang site, known today as ""China's Pompeii,"" was slowly buried beneath five meters of sediment during a massive flood circa A.D. 14-17, leading to exceptional preservation of its buildings, fields, roads and wells.

The Anshang site, discovered in 2012, includes the remains of a human-constructed levee and three irrigation/drainage ditches dating to the Zhou Dynasty (c. 1046-256 BC).

Researchers examined about 50 vertical feet of exposed soil layers at the Anshang site, carefully cleaning sections of a quarry wall to reveal patterns of sedimentary deposits dating back about 10,000 years. Nearly a third of this 10,000-year cross-section has been deposited in the last 2,000 years, indicating that the rate of deposit has steadily increased at a pace that mirrors the expansion of human activity in the region.

While ancient levees may be difficult to spot with an untrained eye, geoarchaeologists employ an array of precise analytic tools to confirm a site's sedimentary history. Soil layers are identified by coloration and tested for physical and chemical alterations linked to human activity. Timeframes are identified through radiocarbon dating of freshwater snail shells and other organic soil matter.

""Thin microscopic sections of dirt samples show organization of soil grains, revealing whether an earthen structure was human-built or laid down as part of a natural sedimentation process,"" Kidder said. ""Our analysis clearly shows that these levees are not naturally formed berms, but are indeed artificially created through the work of humans.""

Kidder's research suggests the Chinese began building drainage/irrigation canals and bank/levee systems along the lower reaches of the Yellow River about 2,900-2,700 years ago. By the beginning of the first millennium A.D., the levee system had been extended much farther up river, lining the banks for several hundred miles, he estimated.

The levees were built in part because of increasing erosion upstream, which was caused by more intensive agriculture and the expansion of the growing Chinese civilization. The sedimentary record shows a vicious cycle of primitive levees built larger and larger as erosion increased and periodic floods grew more widespread and destructive.

""Our evidence suggests that the first levees were built to be about 6-7 feet high, but within a decade the one at Anshang was doubled in height and width,"" Kidder said. ""It's easy to see the trap they fell into: building levees causes sediments to accumulate in the river bed, raising the river higher, and making it more vulnerable to flooding, which requires you to build the levee higher, which causes the sediments to accumulate, and the process repeats itself. The Yellow River has been an engineered river -- entirely unnatural -- for quite a long time.""

Help for understanding climate change's effects

Kidder, an authority on river basin geoarchaeology, has gathered data from the Yellow River excavation sites over the last five summers. He also conducts similar geoarchaeology research along the Mississippi River at a Native American site called Poverty Point in Louisiana.

He argues that geoarchaeology -- a relatively new science that combines aspects of geology and archaeology -- offers the potential to make dramatic contributions to our understanding of how climate change and other large-scale environmental forces are shaping human history.

While there are many theories behind the fall of the Western Han Dynasty, Kidder's research suggests human interaction with the environment played a central role in its demise. In this study, he offers a big-picture explanation for how a complex mix of well-intentioned government policies and technological innovations gradually led the dynasty down a disastrous path of its own making.

The Yellow River, he argues, had existed for eons as a relatively calm and stable waterway until large numbers of Chinese farmers began disturbing the fragile environment of the upper river's Loess Plateau. Built up over the ages by wind-blown sands from the nearby Gobi Desert and Qaidam Basin, the plateau has long boasted some of the world's most erosion-prone soils.

As early as 700 B.C., Chinese authorities were encouraging peasant farmers to move into remote regions of the plateau, citing the need to feed a large and growing population while establishing a buffer of human settlement against the threat of nomadic invaders along its northern border. Construction of The Great Wall swelled populations still further.

Meanwhile, new iron-making technologies vastly increased the effectiveness of plows and other farm tools while spurring rapid deforestation of timber used in iron refining. Widespread erosion in the river's upper regions caused it to carry incredibly heavy loads of sediment downstream where deposits gradually raised the river bed above levees and surrounding fields.

Implications for modern river management

Slowly, over thousands of years, human intervention began to have a dramatic impact on the river's character. Periodic breaches of the levee system led to devastating floods, with some shifting the river's main channel hundreds of miles from its initial course.

A census taken by China in A.D. 2 suggests the area struck by the massive A.D. 14-17 flood was very heavily populated, with an average of 122 people per square kilometer, or approximately 9.5 million people living directly in the flood's path.

""The misery and suffering must have been unimaginable,"" Kidder said.

Historical accounts indicate that communities hit by the flood were soon in complete disarray, with reports of people resorting to banditry to obtain food and stay alive. By A.D. 20-21, the flood-torn region had become the epicenter of a popular rebellion, one that soon would spell the end of the Western Han Dynasty's five-century reign of power.

""The big issue here is that human beings clearly changed the environment, and that these changes had real consequences for human history,"" Kidder said. ""It happened in the past and can happen again.""

While the research offers new insight into Chinese history, it also has interesting implications for modern river management policies around the globe, such as those causing similar flooding problems along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers in the United States.

""To think that we can avoid similar catastrophe today due to better technology is a dangerous notion,"" he said. ""When in doubt, bet on Mother Nature because physics will win every time.""

""Human-caused environmental change is nothing new,"" Kidder said. ""We've been doing this for a very long time, and the magnitude of change is increasing. Unlike ancient China, where human mistakes devastated a single river valley, we now have the technology to make mistakes that can cause devastation on a truly global scale.""","Thu, 19 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,"['research', 'human', 'humans', 'chinese', 'yellow', 'stage', 'set', 'environment', 'ad', 'floods', 'river', 'levees', 'massive', 'system', 'dynastytoppling', 'kidder', 'suggests', 'levee', 'rivers']", 
1,1,FL-2014-000080-CHN,"Colorado River researchers find signs of ancient, devastating floods - Los Angeles Times",https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-colorado-floods-20140618-story.html,"Scientists say it would have been a catastrophe of unprecedented proportions. If the Glen Canyon Dam had failed, it would have changed the lives of millions of people and reshaped the history of the American West.

Only a lucky break in the weather spared the dam in June 1983, as floodwaters coursed through the Colorado River and its tributaries. They pooled in Lake Powell, causing water levels to creep upward at a rate of 3 inches per day.

To avert disaster, engineers tried to shed water through the underground spillways, but the dam began to shudder and groan. The reason soon grew apparent: The water gushing from the base of the dam emerged as a red slurry of sediment flecked with chunks of ancient sandstone. The dam was being eaten away from below.

Now, geologic evidence suggests that the 1983 flood would have paled in comparison to events that occurred long before people started keeping track. These floods were larger and more frequent than modern estimates suggest, according to a paper published online recently in the journal Water Resources Research.

“If we’re thinking about rare, giant flood events, we need to look at more time than the decades represented in a normal stream gage,” said Victor Baker, a study author and geologist at the University of Arizona.

Researchers contend that the short period of instrumental observations might miss extreme floods that happen only once a century, or even once a millennium.

To get a better perspective on ancient water levels, Baker and his colleagues floated down the Colorado River in search of spots where sediments might trap evidence of paleofloods. Signs of high water levels included driftwood deposits, or layers of fine silt that would otherwise be swept away by the river’s swift currents.

The scientists settled on a site near the mountain biking mecca of Moab, Utah, where the river tumbles through a deep canyon of layered crimson bedrock. The shape of the canyon has most likely remained the same for a few millenniums, meaning the scientists can compare flood heights in the past to flood heights measured today.

When the scientists dated the deposits, they tallied more than 40 large floods in the last 2000 years. Of these, 34 exceeded floods expected to strike once a century, and 26 dwarfed the so-called 500-year flood.

That means that although current models predict truly epic floods twice every millennium, there really might be as many as 13.

Researchers say two massive paleofloods proved even worse than scenarios now used by engineers and planners to prepare for future disasters.

After being retrofitted in 1984, the Glen Canyon Dam remains unprepared for the maximum flood size predicted by theory, Baker said, let alone the beasts he discovered.

The disparity between the paleoflood record and modern estimates of flood size and frequency may be due to several reasons.

First, Baker said, sediments do a good job of preserving big floods but flood gages don’t; if they do happen to record a big event, they often break.

Second, without a robust data set of rare, severe floods, scientists using gage records must extrapolate what they know about small, annual floods to make predictions about extreme events.

“You are trying to estimate the tail of the distribution from the middle of the distribution,” said Jim O’Connor, a hydrologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Portland, Ore., who was not involved in the study.

He says finding just one or two big events in a thousand-year interval improves scientists’ understanding of flood probabilities as much as several centuries of gage measurements.

“It’s not something theoretical,” said Noam Greenbaum of the University of Haifa in Israel, the lead author of the study. “What we are actually documenting are the natural floods.”

Determining these natural levels can be tricky, though.

In the last century, more than 100 dams have sprung up between the Colorado’s snowy headwaters in the Rocky Mountains and its delta in Mexico. The river now quenches the needs of seven thirsty states and two countries. It is hardly the same river today that it was when these floods occurred.

Using information about paleofloods poses the risk that decisions “could be made based on conditions of the past that are not applicable for the future,” wrote the Army Corps of Engineers in a 2013 report that expressed mixed feelings about the utility of paleoflood records for modern risk assessment.

But Baker thinks this does not merit excluding the data. It is common sense, he said, that what has happened could happen again.

The changes that have transformed the Colorado don’t necessarily decrease the chances of large floods. Engineers did not design its dams for flood control, they sought to provide water storage and hydropower — “and that works best when dams are full,” Baker said. As illustrated by the events of 1983, purging water from the reservoirs before a flood hits presents its own set of challenges.

On top of all that, the specter of climate change looms over the river and its uncertain future.

“Nature is variable,” Baker said. The Southwest has suffered in the wake of recent droughts, but the long-term history of the region suggests that can change quickly.

“If we are entering a phase because of our changing climate where the extremes are being enhanced, we could see a period of extreme wet,” Baker said, “It may sound like a good thing, but it would be a serious hazard concern.”

Greenbaum cites the uncertainty of future change as a strong argument to seek out long-term flood records to complement the gage measurements of the 20th century.

“During the last 2,000 years, the climate changed a lot. It was maybe sometimes wetter, different periods were dryer,” he said. “Two thousand years is the best record you can have to show what really happened and this is a much more firm basis if you want to predict the future.”

In the end, however, Baker and Greenbaum agree that it’s not up to scientists to decide what to do with this knowledge; it’s a job for engineers.

But they do think the record deserves some attention.

“Ignoring Mother Nature is not too smart,” Baker said, “but that’s just a personal opinion.”

Torrential rains and floods have hit Bulgaria, killing at least 10 people, cutting off electricity, blocking roads and forcing evacuations.

Heavy rainfall in the Black Sea resort city of Varna triggered a flood wave late on Thursday in one of its low-lying suburbs that killed at least 10 people, the mayor of Varna told the national radio.

Several other people are missing.

TV footage showed smashed cars on top of each other on the streets of the suburb, where a state of emergency was declared.

“The tragedy is enormous. I am here on a street in the suburb of Aspruhovo. The street is not here, the houses are not here, there are cars on top of each other,” Varna Mayor Ivan Portnih said.

Electricity in the suburb was cut off, the mayor said.

In central Bulgaria, firefighters evacuated 11 people from the roofs of their houses in the town of Kilifarevo, police said.

Thunderstorms and heavy rains flooded roads and damaged houses in several villages near the capital.

Weather forecasters said the rains that fell in the eastern regions of Varna and Burgas in the past 24 hours equalled the usual amount per month and warned new rainfall and thunderstorms were expected in northern and eastern Bulgaria on Friday.

In late May, neighbouring Balkan countries Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia were hit by the heaviest rainfall since records began 120 years ago.

3,3,FL-2014-000080-CHN,Choosing an Office Location in Shanghai - China Briefing,https://www.china-briefing.com/news/choosing-office-location-shanghai/,"Say you’ve made the decision to take your company to China. You’ve identified Shanghai as the right place to start. Maybe you’ve even heard something of what the Shanghai Free Trade Zone can do for your business. But in a city of over 6,300 km2, and the largest in the world by population, where does one begin to look for an office?

To guide you through this process, here we present the latest information on commercial districts in Shanghai — including trends in vacancy, rental rates and market expansion — and examine the state of commercial property in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone (FTZ).

Puxi or Pudong?

The first decision to make when hunting for office space in Shanghai is which side of the Huangpu River your company will be based on. Puxi, “west of the Huangpu,” is the older of the two and home to a densely concentrated urban population. Its sub-districts include Xujiahui, Luwan, and Jing’an (together forming the former French Concession), as well as Huangpu (site of the historic Bund), and Honqiao (home of Shanghai’s domestic airport).

The heart of old Shanghai, Puxi has seen slightly cheaper average commercial rents than its eastern counterpart Pudong since early 2013. In the first quarter of 2014, average rents for offices in Puxi fell 2.2 percent (quarter-on-quarter) to RMB 8.8 per sm per day, according to Knight Frank. This was enough to bring down Shanghai’s overall office rents, despite rising rents in neighboring Pudong. This trend is predicted to continue in Puxi, where a flood of new supply of Grade-A offices in 2014 may lead to a further 2-percent decrease in rents by the end of 2014. Total office space in Puxi is expected to grow by 2.3 million sq m through 2020.

Pudong, “east of the Huangpu,” is the newer and flashier of the two districts, with its modern skyscrapers emblematic of post-reform China. Notably, it is home to the Lujiazui district, designed to house the city’s financial services industry. The amount of Grade-A office space in Lujiazui grew by an astounding 95 percent between 2000 and 2012, to 1.7 million sq m, but was still unable to keep up with demand. The rapid expansion of commercial space in Pudong in recent years is the result of vigorous government promotion of the area.

Rents in Pudong rose to an average of RMB9.4 per sm per day (an increase of about 1.8 percent) in the first quarter of 2014, attributed to strong demand from domestic companies that has pushed vacancy down to its lowest level in almost 7 years. The second phase of the Lujiazui Century Financial Plaza to be completed later this year will add an additional 220,000 sq m of space to Pudong’s market.

Shanghai FTZ

Pudong is also home to the Shanghai Free Trade Zone (FTZ), launched in September 2013 as a testing ground for market reforms and the smoother facilitation of foreign investment into China. Combined, the FTZ consists of the Waigaoqiao Free-Trade Zone, Waigaoqiao Bonded Logistics Park, Yangshan Bonded Port Area and Pudong Airport Comprehensive Bonded Zone.

Office rents in the FTZ ballooned following its inauguration, as a wave of enterprises rushed in to take advantage of the zone’s preferential regulatory environment; rents peaked in early 2014 at RMB5.90 per square meter per day. Recently, when cross-border trading between the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges was announced in April 2014, this set off a wave of renewed interest in commercial property in the FTZ. According to the Shanghai Statistics Bureau, close to 10,000 businesses had registered within the FTZ as of June 2014—661 of which were foreign-invested enterprises.

At present, a large proportion of offices in the zone are being held by Chinese speculators betting on the future desirability of incorporating in the zone. Until additional reforms are implemented, however, many companies are likely to hold on to these properties but conduct their main business operations outside of the FTZ, leading some analysts to speculate about a growing property bubble in the zone. Further complicating the situation is the fact that large amounts of space in the FTZ were originally given over to logistics-use rather than for offices.

In response, in April 2014, the Shanghai Municipal Government implemented measures to rezone certain industrial districts for offices and R&D, including land within the FTZ. However, owing to the distance between the FTZ’s four districts and Shanghai’s existing central business districts, analysts believe it is unlikely that the zone will become a major commercial hub in the short- to medium-term future. Fortunately, enterprises are permitted to register in the FTZ using a virtual office, rather than an actual physical location, for a cost of RMB20,000 – 30,000 and thereby enjoy the best of both worlds.

Future Directions

The future development of the commercial real estate market in Shanghai will be significantly informed by the Chinese Government’s twin goals of making Shanghai into an international financial hub by 2020 and shifting the national economy away from manufacturing and toward domestic consumption. While these campaigns are likely to exert upward pressure on commercial rents in Shanghai, increasing competition from nearby satellite cities to attract commercial tenants will eventually force the municipal government to implement response measures; for example, introducing thorough-going reforms in the FTZ to justify the higher costs of maintaining an office there.

Overall, Grade-A office space in Shanghai is estimated to increase 80 percent between 2013 and 2020, to a total of 13 million sq m. This will be the strongest growth of any Asia-Pacific business hub, including Mumbai, Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong. Vacancy, which peaked during the global financial crisis at around 17 percent and has since held steady between 5 and 10 percent, is predicted to remain low, under 10 percent through the year 2020.

4,4,FL-2014-000080-CHN,So Much for a Truce: Solar Panel Trade Wars Heat Up - Next City,https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/solar-panel-trade-wars-china-us,"Over the past few years, China has been effectively subsidizing renewable energy in the United States through its support for Chinese photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers. Makers of the solar panels have been given “preferential lending, tax programs and other assistance,” according to the European Union.

Whether because of subsidies or because of China’s low-cost environment and innate manufacturing heft, the world’s largest country has also become the world’s largest manufacturer of the PV panels that convert sunlight into electricity.

While these lower-cost solar panels have been a boon for American homeowners, as well as the growing industry of installers, those who compete directly against the Chinese have not been happy. And the trade wars are only heating up — despite efforts by an American solar trade group to convince China to drop its support for its own panel manufacturers, and the U.S. to drop its retaliatory tariffs against the Chinese.

In Europe, German manufacturer SolarWorld complained recently to the European Commission (the EU’s executive body) that Chinese firms are still flooding the market with panels priced below a price ceiling agreed to last year. As the Wall Street Journal explains:

The settlement, which went into effect in August, allows around 100 Chinese companies to export tariff-free to the EU, as long as they keep their prices above 56 European cents (76 cents U.S.) per watt of solar-panel generation. The threshold has since been lowered to 53 European cents.

EU ProSun filed hundreds of pages of documentation to the EU alleging many violations. Among them, the group said JinkoSolar in April offered solar panels for sale at 45 European cents a watt and LDK, at 46 cents.

“Not one Chinese manufacturer seems to follow the agreed minimum prices for imports into the EU,” EU ProSun President Milan Nitzschke said in a statement. “Dumped Chinese solar products continue to flood the EU market, destroying European industry and jobs. The commission must act fast to stop these violations and implement sanctions.”

Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the trade war is also escalating. The Department of Commerce is recommending higher tariffs on Chinese panels after finding that the Chinese are avoiding the current duties by funneling their products through nearby countries without tariffs, like Taiwan.

The Solar Energy Industries Association, the American trade group, is none too pleased about the action, putting out a statement saying that, “These damaging tariffs will increase costs for U.S. solar consumers and, in turn, slow the adoption of solar within the United States.” While the cost of installing solar panels is affected by much more than the simple price tag for photovoltaic panels (there’s also things like shipping and installation), this action may marginally raise prices for consumers.

As the San Francisco Chronicle reports:

Low panel prices have been a boon to American solar leasing companies such as SolarCity, Sungevity and Sunrun, as well as smaller, “mom and pop” installation businesses. Last year, the American solar industry added 23,682 jobs, according to a census by the Solar Foundation research group. Only 100 new jobs were in manufacturing.

American PV panel manufacturers, however, are quite pleased. “We look forward to the end of illegal Chinese government intervention in the U.S. solar market, and we applaud Commerce for its work that supports fair trade,” the president of Oregon-based SolarWorld Industries America said in response to the federal government’s action.

With the Commerce Department’s recommendations likely to be enacted, this dashes industry hopes that the trade war between the U.S. and China over solar panels will cool down. Expect to see further retaliatory tariffs by the Chinese — and possibly more compensatory action by the United States, unless a truce is called.","Thu, 12 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://nextcity.org/images/daily/_resized/solar_1.jpg,"['solar', 'chinese', 'panels', 'industry', 'panel', 'heat', 'eu', 'truce', 'american', 'trade', 'prices', 'european', 'tariffs', 'wars']", 
5,5,FL-2014-000080-CHN,"Architects, engineers compete to save the New York coastline - PBS NewsHour",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/crowdsourcing-prevent-future-hurricane-sandy,"There were only two emails sitting in Henk Ovink’s inbox when he entered his New York City office on July 19, 2013. One was from a concrete company; the other from an artist in Arizona. Both were entries for his design competition to rebuild storm-damaged New York and New Jersey and protect the community from another Hurricane Sandy. But neither fit the contest criteria. He had expected at least 50 to 75 entries in this competition. And that day was the deadline.

But by lunch, there were 24. And they kept pouring in. By 6 p.m., 148 teams of architects, engineers, scientists and designers from around the world had submitted their flood protection plans for the New York City area.



In this report that aired in October 2013, Miles O’Brien reports on high-tech infrastructure adjustments in New York City after Hurricane Sandy.

In 2012, Hurricane Sandy hammered the New York and New Jersey coasts with eight-foot storm surges, killing 117 people, destroying whole communities and causing an estimated $71 billion in damage for the two states.

Ovink, a Dutch designer who had worked in the Netherlands building for sea level rise and flooding, is a senior advisor to HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan and President Obama’s Hurricane Sandy Recovery Task Force. Climate change and resulting storms like Hurricane Sandy is forcing engineers, architects and governments to change how we live with water, Ovink said. In the future, flood protection and rebuilding needs to encompass be more than simply putting up a wall, he said.

“It’s a paradigm shift from seeing water as a threat and just wanting to be protected to saying water is part of our life. Living with the water is a better perspective to moving forward,” he said.

He and Donovan collaborated to create Rebuild by Design, a competition that challenged designers to collaborate with communities hit by Hurricane Sandy to develop innovative ideas to protect the New York and New Jersey shoreline. After receiving the applications, they divided the 148 applicants into 10 interdisciplinary teams. Each team was asked to form a coalition with their site’s surrounding community leaders, businessmen and residents to guide their design.

“We didn’t want a design team that goes to the community and says, ‘Here’s a golden egg.’ We wanted a collaboration that had a base in those communities and that could be innovative and come up with sustainable solutions,” Ovink said.

Six winners were announced last week. New York state, New York City and New Jersey will be awarded a portion of $920 million from HUD’s Community Development Block Grants-Disaster Recovery for the Sandy region to implement the winning proposals.

Here’s a look at the winners’ plans:

The BIG Team—Lower East Side

Prize: $335 million

The BIG U is a protective series of raised berms and bridges that would stretch along the lower end of Manhattan. The Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) took on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, creating a vertical protection system covering ten miles of coast. The berms and bridges are planted with salt tolerant plants, which would keep ocean water out. The design also allowed for flood walls that can be raised in a disaster. But the spaces are also designed for recreation. A raised berm in Battery Park, protecting the city’s financial district, also provides park recreational space for New Yorkers, and a new maritime building along the water provides flood protection and “Reverse Aquarium”, a water-facing ground floor to educate visitors about the marine life.

OMA—Hudson River Region

Prize: $230 million

OMA’s plan for Weehawken, Hoboken, and Jersey City looks at flood prevention and drainage for the towns. Two-thirds of Hoboken lies in a FEMA flood zone, and 94 percent of its surfaces are impermeable, trapping water. Building wetlands along the towns will delay incoming ocean-water, and filter outgoing storm water. Permeable paving, rain gardens, and bioswales allow surface water to drain, and a rainwater storage system will filter rainwater while serving as a public park.

MIT CAU+ZUS+URBANISTEN—Meadowlands Region

Prize: $150 million

The Meadowlands region is New York City’s “staging area”, said Alexander D’Hooghe, head of the MIT team.

“It’s literally the backstage of New York. If you have a financial firm, the furniture is stored in Meadowlands. The people who work in Manhattan, lower and middle income, live in the Meadowlands,” he said. And more importantly, 80% of New York City’s fuel storage is located in the area, D’Hooghe added. The area, including Little Ferry and Moonachie, was hard hit by Sandy.

D’Hooghe’s team designed a floodable marshland park and a 15 to 17-foot high berm with a street on top. The team also proposed redeveloping the area behind the berm, with mixed-use housing and commercial buildings.

“You can’t do protection just for sake of protection. You have to look at all the other layers. Let’s protect but do in way that’s ecologically beneficial and has the opportunity for economic growth,” D’Hooghe said.

The Interboro Team—Nassau County

Prize: $125 million

Nassau County on Long Island is also threatened by rainwater and storm surge. The Interboro Team proposed rebuilding the South Shore’s diminished wetlands, constructing a series of connected marshes and dikes to guide water back to the bay. The expanded wetlands system cleans stormwater runoff and recharges local aquifers, while providing more space for recreation.

SCAPE/Landscape Architecture—Staten Island

Prize: $60 million

The Living Breakwaters project builds out Staten Island’s shoreline, building a marshland system along the shore supported on underwater berms. The berms, made of eco-friendly concrete, serve as a place for wildlife like clams and mussels to build their homes. Their plans involve wetland education centers for islanders, areas for kayak and recreational equipment storage and support for the local fishing community.

Building wetlands lets the water out in the event of a flood, filtering it and cleaning the surrounding bay. A wall would hold water on the island like a bathtub and further disconnect New Yorkers from their marine surroundings.

“Rather than cut off communities from the water, we would embrace the water and its recreational and economic opportunities,” said Kate Orff, project leader from SCAPE. And the $60 million prize covers nearly the entire cost of the project, she said.

PennDesign/OLIN—Hunts Point

Prize: $20 million

The food market at Hunts Point in the South Bronx distributes food for 22 million people in the tri-state area. It’s also a major jobs center, employing more than 20,000 people and generating $5 billion in revenue. The food distribution center narrowly missed being flooded during Hurricane Sandy, but with sea level rise it will be in the floodplain by 2050, said Richard Roark, partner at OLIN.

“You can’t leave your food supply sitting in a floodplain forever. It’s Russian roulette,” he said.

Hunts Point has more problems than flooding, he said. The area has a 19 percent unemployment rate, air and water pollution problems from the local industrial complexes. The PennDesign/OLIN project builds on the South Bronx Greenway, keeping transportation open in a disaster, incorporating floating flood walls to protect the food distribution center. The new “cleanways” provide transportation routes for residents, incorporating eelgrass and other wetland plants to stall rising water and filter storm runoff. Another component of the design is a Levee Lab along the Bronx and East rivers, which acts as a levee and allows engineers and scientists the opportunity to test how seawalls perform under different current conditions.

Correction: An earlier version of the story said that the winning teams would receive a portion of disaster recovery funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This money will be awarded to New York state, New York City and New Jersey to implement the winning proposals.","Wed, 18 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/uploads/2014/06/BIG-U_140326_Web-Images_3_The-Harbor-Berm1.jpg,"['compete', 'coastline', 'hurricane', 'engineers', 'save', 'area', 'team', 'protection', 'jersey', 'flood', 'water', 'architects', 'city', 'york', 'sandy']", 
6,6,FL-2014-000080-CHN,Copper loses its luster - where next? - CNBC.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/12/copper-loses-its-luster--where-next.html,"The drop in price has centered on reports of an investigation at China's northeastern port of Qingdao, which has raised fears that large quantities of the metal could flood the market. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange edged lower by 0.35 percent on Thursday morning to $6,666 per tonne, close to levels not seen since early May. Prices on Asian benchmarks also fell lower during the overnight session.

Prices of copper – the industrial metal used in everything from cars to houses – have declined this week, heading towards a one-month low, with analysts concerned the sell-off could continue and become worse than the recent March fall.

In China, the world's biggest consumer of the metal, cooper is used as collateral in financial deals as well as for manufacturing purposes. China's copper inventories have increased to around 800 kilotonnes in 2014 of which around 300-400 kilotonnes is held in financing deals, according to figures from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Officials in Qingdao are investigating whether some financing deals have been made using copper that didn't actually not exist.

This has spooked the market despite the port holding an extremely small portion of global inventories. It has also led some to shift their stocks to supposedly more reputable warehouses and has led others to speculate that investors could walk away from these deals, thus liquidating the market. Analysts at Citi predicted a continued pullback in net long positions of copper this month after it witnessed a 24 percent reduction in net long positions on the U.S. COMEX exchange at the beginning of the month.

""Many of these extreme scenarios are not our base case, although we acknowledge that the issues in Qingdao could continue to cause short-term distortions and may ultimately limit liquidity available for financing deals,"" commodity analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, led by Michael Widmer, said in a note on Thursday.

The investment bank has been forecasting a continued slide in copper for the whole of this week, and maintained that outlook on Thursday. BofA Merrill Lynch's average second-quarter forecast remains at $6,500 per tonne, but it does not anticipate a collapse. Prices had slipped to these levels in March when a sudden drop coincided with fears of regulatory tightening in China for these copper-backed deals.

Read MoreAre commodities set for a sharper correction?

The metal is often seen as a gauge for the health of the global economy – hence its nickname ""Dr Copper"". For investors it has become increasingly difficult to separate how much copper imports are due to ""real"" industrial demand or how much is due to financing activities. More and more of these copper-backed loans originate from Singapore, according to a report on Thursday in the Financial Times. This is due to international banks moving their China business out of Hong Kong, it said, and it has cast a shadow on the sovereign city-state.

Over the long term, Deutsche Bank believes that the tighter control on the use of copper would add a degree of confidence to the market. In a report last week, the bank said it could limit the divergence between real and apparent demand. Meanwhile, Societe Generale analysts have shrugged off the concerns from China and have instead released a report this week detailing how Indian consumption could surge in the wake elections in the country. Its forecasts are for copper to average $6,750 in 2014 and up to $7,500 in 2019.","Thu, 12 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/101494670-111972814.jpg?v=1532564522,"['luster', 'deals', 'metal', 'report', 'bank', 'week', 'financing', 'analysts', 'china', 'copper', 'market', 'loses']", 
7,7,FL-2014-000080-CHN,Tibet's Slow Burn | Time - TIME,https://time.com/2900830/tibets-slow-burn/,"Even though his words could land him in jail, the monk isn’t afraid. We are inside his mud-brick lodgings, safe from the security cameras that track a people so desperate that about 130 Tibetans have torched their own bodies in fiery dissent since 2011. Clerics, farmers, herdsmen, teachers, even a 15-year-old schoolgirl have all self-immolated to protest Chinese rule. Here, in the hills around Labrang Monastery, one of the holiest sites in Tibetan Buddhism, a dozen people have chosen such incendiary suicide against the Chinese authorities. In the ensuing security crackdown, communist minders have instructed local clergy not to talk about politics or anything that might harm the illusion of serenity. Yet this monk, who was ordained when he was 11 years old, speaks out. “The Chinese government has stolen our holy place,” he says, “and turned it into a tourist destination.”

For much of the year, the whitewashed labyrinth of Labrang, in the barren furrows of northwest China’s Gansu province, heaves with tourists from China’s Han ethnic majority, who make up some 90% of the country’s population. Some are pilgrims searching for meaning in a society in which neither communism nor capitalism offers spiritual succor. Others are members of China’s expanding middle class, exhilarated by a newfound freedom to travel. Even the memory of the 2008 violence between Han and Tibetans, which resulted in dozens of deaths and an ensuing security clampdown, hasn’t dissuaded the domestic visitors. While overseas tourism in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) has dwindled because the government now only sporadically lets in foreigners, 13 million Han Chinese vacationed there last year, arriving via newly built roads, railways and airports. A decade ago, only 1 million visited. In the summer, the grasslands near Labrang, one of many Tibetan areas outside the TAR proper, are so crowded with Han campers that the vegetation is rubbed bare.

The grim news of Tibetans setting themselves on fire has forced the world to confront the intensity of despair on the high plateau. But this anguish remains a mystery to many Han. The authorities have poured billions of dollars into the region through infrastructure and investment. Tourism to Tibetan areas is seen as another key driver of growth. China’s ethnic policy—not just for Tibetans but also for the Uighurs of the northwestern region of Xin­jiang—is based on the premise that financial betterment will convince minorities of the utility of Han rule. Such is the intoxicating mix of fresh air and fattening wallets that local propaganda czars have deemed the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, China’s “happiest city.”

Chinese officials—and many Chinese citizens—wonder why a dramatic increase in Tibetan living standards has not sated a people whom, the official line goes, were enslaved by god-kings until the People’s Liberation Army arrived in 1950. Beijing blames the wave of self-immolations on the current Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader who escaped to India after a failed uprising in 1959. The exiled monk maintains he has no role in orchestrating the suicides. “This is very, very sad,” he told TIME in February, while visiting Washington. “Human life is very, very precious.”

Government oppression of ethnic minorities is hardly unique to China. But the pace of change in Tibet and neighboring Xin­jiang, where Islam is the dominant faith, has added urgency to the plight of China’s ethnic peoples. Among these minority populations, there is a sense that some of China’s borderlands are under siege by the Han, and some of those who can—which is not very many people at all—are trying to flee. Whether their destinations are Nepal, Thailand, Cambodia or elsewhere, Tibetans and Uighur refugees can find themselves forcibly repatriated—often into Chinese detention. Such is the diplomatic might of Beijing in an age of Chinese economic ascendancy. Meanwhile, ethnic violence is bubbling up, whether the inward attacks of the Tibetan self-immolators or, more troublingly, deadly assaults on civilians blamed on Uighurs. In the bloodiest terror attack this year, explosions at a market in Xin­jiang’s capital, Urumqi, on May 22 claimed 43 lives, including those of the assailants. Authorities blamed the attack on Uighur separatists.

Such bloodshed has elicited harsh official reprisals. Hundreds of locals in Xin­jiang and Tibetan regions have been rounded up by the authorities. Online and cell-phone communication is often severed, leaving all residents—not just those who might be guilty—in the dark. On a trip to Xin­jiang in late April, China’s President Xi Jinping hailed police, who are mostly Han, as the “fists and daggers” in the battle against terrorism and separatism. “Sweat more in peacetime to bleed less in wartime,” Xi was quoted as saying in Chinese state media. Many Han—still grieving over a spree of terrorism blamed on Uighurs, ignorant of the daily repression of ethnic minorities and puzzled over their unwillingness to unite in a rising China—welcomed their leader’s strong stand.

The Money God

No doubt, economic development has transformed Tibetan areas, with billboards for iPhones towering over gold-tipped stupas. Although Han monopolize the best state jobs, Tibetans with Mandarin-language skills enjoy newfound career opportunities as guides, traders, trinket-shop owners and even lamas who can translate their faith to Han devotees. One in 10 Tibetans in Tibet is now employed by the tourism industry. “It’s naive to say that all the money is going to the Han,” says James Leibold, a senior lecturer at La Trobe University in Melbourne, who visited Lhasa last year. “Tibetans are profiting too.” The Dalai Lama told TIME, “We Tibetans also want more modernization.”

But money alone cannot erase the sense that Tibet is under enemy control. Power in Tibetan terrain continues to reside in outside hands. No Tibetan has ever held the TAR’s highest political position, that of the region’s Communist Party secretary. Hopes that President Xi, who took power in late 2012 from hard-liner Hu Jin­tao, would nurture cultural reforms have stagnated. If anything, government restrictions on worship—nearly all Tibetans adhere to local Buddhist traditions—have tightened across the plateau, as security forces crack down on anyone believed to be connected to the self-immolations. Hundreds have been jailed, some just for watching the burnings, according to international human-rights groups.

In Lhasa, the region’s spiritual heart, Tibet­ans cannot complete pilgrimages without enduring a cavalcade of police checks. Some are turned away. Meanwhile, tourists with Han faces tend to get waved through. Facing an onslaught of Han visitors—not to mention a flood of migrants from elsewhere in China who hope to make their fortunes in this harsh, distant land—some Tibetans fear they could one day become minorities in their homeland. Although 90% of Tibet is still Tibetan, only a few hundred Han lived in Lhasa before the People’s Republic was formed in 1949. In January a group of Han celebrities led a power walk of 1,000 people through Lhasa. The fresh-air campaign was widely covered by state media, with one Han movie star known for his devotion to Tibetan Buddhism dubbed an ambassador for Lhasa. “Imagine, if even 10 Tibetans gathered together in Lhasa, the secret police would immediately arrest us,” says Tsering Woeser, a Tibetan activist and poet who divides her time between Lhasa and Beijing. “The Han have political rights in Tibet that we lack. It makes us feel our own absence of power more strongly.”

Such existential angst coincides with a fascination for all things Tibetan in the rest of China. Newly pious Han are donating money for the renovation of monasteries—some of the same monasteries whose monks have been locked up for allegedly associating with self-immolators. Rich Chinese are bidding at auction for antique thangkas, the Buddhist prayer paintings, and studying versions of the Tibetan faith in faraway Beijing. “The most attractive thing about Tibetan Buddhism to me is that it adores nature,” says Wang Xinmin, a 29-year-old believer who worships in the Chinese capital. “It gives you a lot of freedom.” An April headline in the Communist Party–linked Global Times proclaimed “Young Han Chinese Turn to Tibetan Buddhism Amid Worldly Frustrations,” quoting one devotee who thinks that “it is even cooler to sing Tibetan prayers in hip-hop!” Although statistics on Han converts don’t exist, one Tibetan lama has more than a million followers on Weibo, China’s micro­blogging service. Another cleric’s spiritual tome sold 50,000 copies in a fortnight. Rumors proliferate about top Chinese leaders whose relatives have embraced Tibetan Buddhism—this in an officially atheist communist nation. “Tibetan Buddhist tradition is of immense benefit to millions of Chinese Buddhists,” said the Dalai Lama.

Yet, when speaking to Han who have visited Tibetan regions recently, I was struck that no one knew how common self-immolations had become. With the proliferation of information available online, Chinese are increasingly adept at parsing the state media’s censored coverage. Clumsy propaganda gets ridiculed, official silences are questioned. Yet such discernment doesn’t often extend to Tibet. “I’m not sure if stories of people burning themselves are real or fake,” says Gong Lin, an IT professional from the southern Chinese boomtown of Shenzhen, who visited Lhasa last year on vacation. “I think I would have heard more about it if it were true.”

Most Han are ignorant about the plight of Tibetans. They don’t know that at Tibetan monasteries, monks must regularly denounce the Dalai Lama in “political rectification” classes. In Labrang, government notices, written only in Tibetan, proscribe clergy from lighting incense or yak-butter lamps. Often, the men in robes don’t abide by the directive—one notice I saw in a monastic compound was pasted under a picture of the Dalai Lama, which is itself a banned image. But the weight of prohibition enervates the place. Even news of a $27 million renovation of the 300-year-old Labrang complex is freighted with bitterness. “It’s just being done for tourists,” says one monk, unable to see any good in Han motives. “The [Han] Chinese, they come to pray, but they understand nothing about us.”

In Tibet, politics cannot be cleaved from faith. Many Han, however, embrace the instruments of Tibetan Buddhist piety—the mystical texts, the prayer wheels, the bright mandalas—without acknowledging the desperation of monks who light matches to end their lives. Questioning Han faithful isn’t fair—who am I to say who is a true believer? Han are drawn to Tibetan Buddhism for the same reason foreign seekers have long been: an aura of purity floats over Tibetan lands. Besides, if worshippers are drawn to Tibetan Buddhism precisely for its otherworldly calm, can we really expect them to adopt political outrage as a mantra? Ethnic causes court trouble in China. “There are several taboos in China, and one is the Tibet and Xin­jiang issue,” says Hu Jia, a Han democracy advocate in Beijing. “These places are like military occupation zones, with police and soldiers everywhere. The heavy-handed policies are even more severe than in Han areas.”

The Ethnic Divide

Like americans faced with the conundrum of holding territory once possessed by native peoples, the vast majority of Han take as fact that Tibet is an inalienable part of China—and has been for centuries. Alternate narratives don’t resonate. Complicating matters is the typecasting of Tibetans (and Uighurs, even more) as an unpredictable, martial tribe. It is true that history is filled with battles between Han soldiers and Tibetan forces; over the centuries, Tibet­ans also clashed with Mongols, Manchus, Gurkhas, Uighurs and Muslim Hui. Wrapped in a gauze of tranquility, Tibet­an Buddhism may be gaining influential Han acolytes, but Tibet itself denotes danger. Many Han tourists see the stifling security presence in Lhasa and other Tibetan sites as reassuring, not Orwellian. “The Han majority tends to carry a racist attitude toward Tibet­ans,” says La Trobe University’s Leibold. “There’s a fear because they are different.”

Ethnic tourism is a complicated issue for many countries—how authentic an experience is a sweat-lodge ceremony at a Native American reservation? Isn’t there a whiff of exoticism about watching any people in native dress performing ancient rituals for iPhone-toting visitors? But the difference is this: most Americans, at least glancingly, know that the U.S. government’s extermination of indigenous populations is a shameful part of history. Many Han tourists, by contrast, simply do not know that they are considered the colonizers.

The Dalai Lama has consistently called for a middle ground with China. “We are not seeking independence,” he told Time. “We are seeking general autonomy.” Decades of propaganda about a “wolf in monk’s clothing” have not dulled Tibetan reverence for him. Most self-immolators are believed to have used their dying breaths to call for the Dalai Lama’s return to Tibet. For now, the exiled monk’s moderate stance holds sway. But once the 78-year-old cleric passes from the scene, separatist sentiment may harden. If violence explodes, as last happened in 2008 when dozens of Tibetans and Han died, what will happen to the tourism industry that the Chinese government says is so vital to regional development?

Back at the Labrang Monastery, cement mixers churn, as the government-funded renovation proceeds. Tibetan pilgrims prostrate themselves, their bodies flung forth on dirt paths in veneration; undercover security agents, not very well disguised, watch them crawl past. A Han tourist snaps a photo. On the road into Xiahe, the town next to Labrang, I see a propaganda sign that commands, “Hold High the Flag of the Communist Party. Satisfy the People.” I last visited Xiahe eight years ago. As in many places in China, the building boom is such that I recognize nearly nothing from my last visit. Then, the town was predominantly Tibetan. Today, it is neatly divided: a Disneyfied Tibet­an section, with Han and Muslim Hui shopkeepers selling Buddhist amulets and yak key rings, and a Han part—tiled buildings, blue glass windows, karaoke parlors—that could be any place in China.

Across Xiahe are signs warning of imprisonment for anyone who aids self-immolations or fails to report information that could stop them. Near the junction of the two halves of town—Han and Tibetan—is the local Public Security Bureau. It was in front of this symbol of the Chinese state that a 58-year-old Tibetan farmer drenched himself with fuel and set himself on fire in October 2012. (A day before, a herdsman had self-immolated at Labrang itself.) I talk to a Tibetan monk who happened to be passing by the government office when the farmer burned himself two years ago. “I do not think he was a hero,” he says, mindful of the Buddhist proscription on suicide. “But I know he was doing it for his people, and I respect his bravery.” What else does the monk recall from that day? He thinks for a moment and wraps his burgundy robes around himself. “I remember,” the young monk says, “that he glowed for a very long time.”

9,9,FL-2014-000080-CHN,"Feedly, Evernote And Others Become Latest Victims Of DDoS Attacks - TechCrunch",https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/11/feedly-evernote-and-others-become-latest-victims-of-ddos-attacks/,"Who have the DDoS attackers not hit? That’s the question. This morning, RSS reader and feed-syncing platform Feedly is being hit by a distributed denial-of-service attack, where again the criminals are attempting to extort money in return for returning the service to normal operations. And only yesterday, Evernote was a victim of a similar attack.

These attacks seem to be increasing in frequency, and now leave a long line of victimized sites in their wake, including Meetup, Basecamp, Vimeo, Bit.ly, SAY Media/TypePad, Namecheap, Plenty of Fish and Moz, to name a few of the more recent victims.

And on Friday, cloud-based security services provider Incapsula fought off a 100 gigabits per second DDoS attack against an online gambling website that utilized more than five DDoS attack vectors, including a SYN flood, large SYN flood, NTP amplification, DNS flood and DNS amplification, according to reports.

If you’re not familiar with the tech lingo, just know this: These DDoS attackers have uncovered more powerful ways to attack by exploiting insecure Internet protocols, like NTP, which allow for attacks that in years past would have been considered record-breaking.

For comparison’s sake, one of the largest DDoS attacks was that of Spamhaus last year, which peaked at 300 Gbps in size. Now massive attacks are par for the course, and as network providers improve in their ability to protect against these attacks, the criminals are stepping up, too. In Incapsula’s DDoS report from this spring, the company found that 81 percent of DDoS attacks are now multi-vector, and these are becoming more common.

Increase In Attacks

Every day, sites around the world are being hit, as this map shows. And, according to Matthew Prince, CEO of CloudFlare, whose company has worked with many of the victims to help them restore service, large-scale attacks have been ramping up.

“As a general trend, over the last three months there’s been an increase in very large attacks targeting DNS infrastructure. These appear to be coming from a large botnet concentrated in China. That doesn’t mean the attacker is actually in China, just that there are a lot of compromised PCs running there,” he explains.

These attacks are always high in bandwidth, but they’re large in the number of packets sent per second – some as high as 200 million+ per second. However, most of these new-style attacks have been hitting gambling sites, not the tech companies. However, Prince notes, that may change in time.

“I won’t be surprised when these extremely high packet volume attacks start targeting more mainstream sites,” he adds. “The challenge is, unless you have a massive network like Google or CloudFlare to absorb them, the attacks are getting large and sophisticated enough that even a large, tech-savvy organization like Evernote has no way of stopping them on their own.”

Evernote And Feedly

In Evernote’s case, the company noted yesterday evening that it was unavailable, and that it was working to neutralize a denial of service attack. A few hours later, a message on Evernote’s Twitter account said its service was restored – but it’s not out of the woods yet. “There may be a hiccup or two for the next 24 hours,” the tweet warned.

Evernote is up and running. There may be a hiccup or two for the next 24 hours. We appreciate your patience. — evernote (@evernote) June 11, 2014

Early this morning, around 2 a.m. PT, Feedly became the next target. Again, like most companies who publicly disclose their status, Feedly is not paying the cybercriminals the ransom demanded, but is instead working with its network providers to mitigate the attack, as well as with other victims and law enforcement. As of 6:25 a.m. PT, Feedly says that while it has a restoration plan in place, it will still be several hours before the service is back online. Fortunately, users’ data has not been lost or compromised, the blog post notes.

It’s interesting that, while none of these more high-profile companies are paying the attackers off, the DDoS attacks continue. Why is that?

It could be that while the ones conscientiously updating their customers as to their status are not playing the criminals’ games, others may be. We had heard from one source that some New York-based tech companies did pay off DDoS attackers when they were hit, but never said anything — the only way you would know is if the companies were experiencing outages.

We’ve not been able to confirm this, so count this as a rumor for now. However, it would make sense that if some victims pay, the attacks will never end. Just like spam email, someone keeps clicking.","Wed, 11 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/screen-shot-2014-06-11-at-10-13-54-am.png?w=621,"['ddos', 'large', 'techcrunch', 'hit', 'attack', 'feedly', 'sites', 'service', 'latest', 'attacks', 'victims', 'evernote', 'companies', 'hours']",

“I wasn’t worried when we were evacuated. We had about a half hour to get out of the house. I thought there might be some sewer backup so I ran downstairs and lifted the things I could quickly lift and put them up high.”

Verhun then left on a trip to Edmonton, confident he could deal with the fallout when he returned a couple of days later.

“I got up early the next morning, turned on the news to see what had happened and immediately drove back.”

He made his way through four feet of water – his mission – to rescue the family cats.

“I waded outside with the cats and the kids were cheering.”

As traumatic as that day was, Verhun says the weeks and months that followed were a rollercoaster, emotionally and financially. The cleanup took weeks, the repairs, months.

Verhun estimates the family’s financial losses at over half a million dollars. The insurance company covered 20% of it – even though overland flooding isn’t normally covered. The repairs were extensive: windows, doors and floors replaced, the kitchen rebuilt, the installation of a new furnace, ducting and electrical wiring – the list goes on.

Verhun, who has spent many years helping others as a founding director of the Calgary Homeless Foundation, is grateful for all the people who have helped him. He says he doesn’t know he could have faced it without the support of friends, neighbours and strangers.

“Marcus Koenig waded in wearing jeans to help us on Saturday and was still helping in December; another neighbour showed up with a sewage pump; a team from Conroy Ross (Verhun’s employer) organized three shifts to provide cleanup help and food until we could dry out the house; even an Olympian, Jan Hudak, showed up to help. He signed my daughter’s ski helmet with ‘never give up.'”

Many complete strangers also showed up to help the family, including five men with crowbars who spent a day in the basement pulling nails and a man who showed up with a toolbox and spent six hours removing floor tiles.

With the flood anniversary approaching, it’s clear Verhun is nervous about the potential for it happening all over again; there’s a lot at stake. He says the bigger stake though, is ensuring the provincial government follows through with upstream mitigation projects so no Calgarian ever has to through a major flood again.","Mon, 16 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/134ef81f5668dc78080f6bd19ca2310b?s=32,"['spent', 'verhun', 'showed', 'catch', 'share', 'unbelievable', 'friends', 'getting', 'flood', 'help', 'support', 'twitter']",

According to the report, coal was the fastest-growing fossil fuel worldwide last year, and “coal’s share of global primary energy consumption reached 30.1 percent, the highest since 1970.” Despite a decrease in coal usage by North America and Europe over the past several years (due in large part to cheaper natural gas), global coal consumption has risen to new highs, driven by the growing and power-hungry markets of China and India. And, as might be expected, worldwide carbon emissions grew again last year, by another 2.1 percent. Despite increasing urgency from the scientific community to reduce carbon emissions to head off climate disaster, and the small but growing use of renewable energy sources, coal appears to be the fuel of choice at the moment, and predictions are that its usage will continue to rise.","Wed, 18 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/yS1s91az6IcsdwYHtKkIp2tJd4E=/0x70:1247x719/960x500/media/img/photo/2014/06/global-coal-usage-reaches-44-year-high/c01_59525007-1/original.jpg,"['reaches', 'usage', '44', 'report', 'emissions', 'despite', 'worldwide', 'fuel', 'global', 'coal', 'high', 'energy', 'growing']",

It has been almost a year since the floods and residents in Rideau Park and Roxboro say that there is still a lot of work to do.

“My back fence was damaged. We put it back the best we can. I think I might have to change my garage. A lot of the tools in there are rusted and rotten but we'll survive,” said Yusuf Jareri, Roxboro resident.

Margret Swann also lives in Roxoboro and says when the water receded the mess was almost unreal.

“The mud, the pails of mud and debris were indescribable,” said Swann, “The yard is coming back. The grass is growing but it was traumatic. Without the help and volunteers and support of the city, it really would have been devastating.”

James Maxim shares many of the same memories and says the water in his basement was chest deep.

“It was dark because there was no lights so I had my hip-waders on and then I started going down with my flashlight and as I came down I just went down deeper and deeper into the water,” said Maxim. “Everything was floating around and the one thing that stuck in my mind, when I was looking at this mess, is there was a steak that had come out of the deepfreeze because the two deepfreezes and the fridges and all the furniture had got all piled up and floated around and there was a steak that was sort of floating by.”

Maxim recently finished repairs and is now turning a bad situation into something good by rallying the residents to be proactive rather than reactive.

“We put forward what we call secondary flood mitigation strategy, sort of personal property protection. We've spent money in the community. It’s a cookie cutter type of situation that calls upon sand bags and new high tech sand bags and it also talks about where we can put temporary berms and we ourselves have bought some flood sacks to be prepared,” said Maxim.

He says by his estimate repairs in Rideau Park and Roxboro are only halfway completed and he believes they are several years from being back to normal.

“The overall aspect of it is still, I think, two, three, maybe even five years down the road where we can really feel comfortable that we’ve put in place the mitigated measures,” said Maxim.

Maxim says he hopes his community doesn’t flood again but says they really came together when it counted.

“All of facing ground zero destruction and what we saw is basically a community coming together, looking at the future and asking questions, which is very important of getting it out and talking about it.”

The city is still working in many communities and has posted a flood preparation guide on its website for residents.

A State of Emergency has been declared in a number of communities in southern Alberta.

In Coaldale, the rain has been relentless and a number of rural properties are flooded because the culverts are unable to keep up with drainage.

""We've had it in our basement once, it came through our sewer. But right now we've put a higher extension on the sewer so hopefully the house stays dry this time,'"" said Joanne Voorhorst from Coaldale.

In Fort Macleod water has flooded into some low-lying areas, parks, campgrounds, and a portion of the river valley including Highway 811.

In High River, the town's Emergency Operations Centre was activated at 11:15 a.m. on Thursday.

Officials say the Highwood River is expected to peak at about midnight at 240cms and is currently running at 200 cubic metres per second.

“This is a level one activation, which means that it will involve minimal staff and only pertains to one specific area of Town,” explained Len Zebedee, deputy director of emergency operations. “The river forecast has changed slightly, which could impact Wallaceville, and we wanted to be prepared should we need to increase our response.”

Some overland flooding is happening in Okotoks and a few streets flooded. Crews delivered sandbags to some residents along a creek in the middle of the night to help keep the water out.

""Around 3 o'clock the Town of Okotoks delivered us some sandbags and we had to put sandbags over there and I'm glad they did because if they didn't we would have definitely had water in our basement so we're sure thankful,"" said Okotoks resident Ron Krysko.

Meanwhile, in Claresholm, the community remains under a rainfall warning and pumps have been running non-stop to help homeowners. About 60 homes in the area have been affected by some flooding and crews are already working to dry out basements.

The reception centre at the Claresholm Arena was closed on Wednesday night, but the Emergency Operations Centre will remain open.

Elections Canada has also notified nearly 5,000 registered voters in Claresholm that their polling station, for the Macleod byelection, has changed.

All voters scheduled to vote at stations 122 to 133 will now vote at the Stavely Arena, located at 5004-51 Avenue in Stavely, Alberta.

Lethbridge's fire chief says the flow on the Oldman River is expected to peak on Friday at an estimated flow of 1,800 m/s, well short of earlier estimates of 4,500 m/s.

About 250 homes there have been affected by overland flooding, but officials are monitoring water levels. Residents are being reminded to stay back from the riverbanks.

Workers in Medicine Hat are taking any chances with the forecast, using the time they have to build a berm to protect City Hall and the law courts from flooding.

The river there isn't expected to peak until Saturday morning and there have been no evacuation orders.

A football fan has died after staying up until the early hours for three straight nights watching World Cup matches.

Now fans across China have been warned to ration their soccer intake because of the exhausting 11-hour time difference between the country and Brazil.

Zhou Meng, 39, from Shanghai, died from a brain haemorrhage while watching Costa Rica's exciting 3-1 win over Uruguay.

The high blood pressure sufferer was rushed to the Shanghai No. 10 People's Hospital after suffering a stroke and pronounced dead several hours later.

Relatives said Zhou was a keen football fan and had already stayed up for the two previous nights watching televised matches from Brazil.

Zhou was sitting on his sofa in front of his TV at home in the early hours of Sunday when he suddenly collapsed.

A hospital spokesman said people with high blood pressure and heart conditions are more vulnerable to brain haemorrhages when events make them excited or emotional.

Shanghai's hospitals reported a larger number of emergency cases than usual last weekend - the first weekend of the World Cup.

Accident and emergency units said the number of patients increased by 50% over the weekend.

Some 40% had respiratory or stomach problems, often caused by irregular eating and sleeping patterns.

Most group games start at midnight, 3am, 4am and 6am, in China leaving fans struggling to balance their football fix with their daily routine.

""I've been watching games every day for the past three days, mostly the 3am and 6am games,"" said Liu Yitao, a 29-year-old white collar worker.

Liu admitted on Monday he was feeling tired at work and now plans only to watch group stage games at weekends.

On Saturday, a 50-year-old driver, who is said to have stayed up all night watching the football died with four passengers when their vehicle collided with a bus in a tunnel in Wenzhou, eastern China.

And in the cities of Suzhou and Dalian, different cases of a fan dying while watching games were reported.","Tue, 17 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article3695498.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Uruguay-v-Costa-Rica.jpg,"['nights', 'world', 'shanghai', 'staying', 'stayed', 'straight', 'fan', 'cup', 'dies', 'football', 'games', 'watching', 'weekend', 'died', 'late', 'hours']", 
15,15,FL-2014-000080-CHN,"What 5 Cities, 17K Cyclists, and 20K Cars Tell Us About Protected Bike Lanes - Next City",https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/us-city-bike-lanes-bike-safety,"Protected bike lanes — a.k.a. “cycle tracks,” or “green lanes” for the color they’re often painted — are far rarer in the United States than they are in Europe, and U.S. cities, says Christopher Monsere, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Portland State University, are holding off on creating them until they better understand how they fit into urban traffic flow. Monsere and a team of 10 other researchers recently examined how protected lanes work in Austin, Chicago, Portland, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and found that while Americans generally support green lanes, understanding how those lanes are perceived — by cyclists and drivers — is critical for promoting future citywide acceptance.

One reason why protected bike lanes haven’t gotten more traction, suggests Monsere, is that the civil engineers involved in designing city streets have tended to be “vehicular cyclists” — or road riders accustomed to mixing with on-street traffic. “They didn’t think that on-street facilities of any kind were good to begin with,” explains the professor, “and that [green lanes] are even worse, because they put cyclists out of the space where drivers would see them. They’d forget about them, and at the intersections it would cause all kinds of chaos.”

But the researchers studied 168 hours of footage from the five cities’ lanes — a full week’s worth of around-the-clock viewing — that captured the intermixing of nearly 17,000 bicyclists and 20,000 cars but little chaos: Not only were there no recorded collisions, but no recorded near-collisions either. “Intersections are still the riskiest part” of bike lanes, says Monsere, “and there are improvements and tweaks that could be done, but we saw no reasons for concern.” (The cities examined by the multi-year study are taking part in the non-profit group People for Bikes’ “Green Lane Project.”

The Portland State team talked to the cyclists, too, and across the board about a quarter of the riders said that they were riding their bicycles more because of the new presence of the protected lanes; that rate varied from 19 percent on San Francisco’s Oak Street path to 54 percent on Chicago’s Dearborn lane.

The researchers also asked riders they intercepted how safe they were made to feel by various methods for separating bike traffic from car traffic. (People for Bikes identifies 14 different design options , from simple striping to “turtle bumps” to barriers made up of parked cars.) Physical barriers, not surprisingly, made riders feel more secure than mere painted ones. But there are hints that if cities are aiming to up ridership by upping safety, perception matters considerably. Says Monsere, “The flex post ,” as in a plastic pole that delineates the edge of the bike path, “came out relatively high even though it provides no diversion from vehicles at all.”

The researchers found that the vast majority of the general public — drivers, walkers, transit-takers, bicyclists, those who mix modes — back the premise of the green lane. Some 91 percent of residents surveyed by the researchers agreed with the statement, “I support separating bikes from cars.”

But residents, found the study, were more split on the idea that the protected bike lanes up the appeal of their neighborhoods. Some 43 percent of those asked said that the presence of protected lanes for cycling made their neighborhood “more desirable,” while an equal percentage said that they had no effect. And 14 percent said that having green lanes made where they live less desirable.

One reason that locals might not be more thrilled about protected bike lanes is parking. Across the cities, some 30 to 55 percent of drivers reported that the lanes limited their parking options. But here’s the kicker: That occurred even in cases where the addition of the lanes has limited effect or no effect on parking. Indeed, finds the study, some 30 percent of residents around Portland’s Multnomah lane reported that “the lane made parking more difficult to find,” even though when adding the lane the city also added some 27 parking spaces.

All of which serves to remind city planners that the future success of protected bike lanes in the United States doesn’t just depend on adding some green paint, but on what people think of when they see it.","Thu, 12 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://nextcity.org/images/daily/_resized/Chicago_BikeLane.jpg,"['cars', 'traffic', 'bike', 'protected', 'green', 'cyclists', 'lanes', '20k', '17k', 'parking', 'monsere', 'tell', 'researchers', 'lane', 'cities']",

Flood victims in Solomon Islands say they have been given assurances they won't be forced out of the government-run emergency shelters in Honiara.

About 1,500 people are still being housed in the evacuation centres after April's deadly flash floods which killed at least 21 people and left thousands homeless.

The Solomon Islands Government has denied local media reports that the flood centres will be closed this weekend.

Flood victims spokesman Charles Ketea has told Pacific Beat the minister has given an assurance not move anyone from the centres just yet.

""He told us that this is not true...that they will be strictly removing us from these evacuations centres,"" he said.

""The victims have confidence...we trust that even though we hear the story that they'll close this evacuation centre, we believe it will not [happen].

""We are all citizens. We should be living here. We should wait until the land planning is finished and we will move to that block of land.""

Mr Ketea says they will be staying put until the government prepares a new area of land to allow them to move.

""We had a meeting with the Minister of Land...what he has told us is that there is land there...the land that has been promised is there,"" he said.

""The idea for us to move from this evacuation centre - he told us that we will never go, we will never go, we will wait until all that land-making is finished, and then we will go to that land.""

Mumbai: Mumbai witnessed high tides at the Gateway of India on Sunday, reminding people of the floods of July 26, 2005.

High tide killed one person on Sunday, while another was rescued from Marine Drive, ANI reported.

The residents seem to enjoy the view despite a slight fear of floods.

""It's a great attraction over here because we don't get to see such high tide very regularly, people do recall the floods of July 26, but I don't think there'll be a problem because the police has done a very good job here. Nobody is being allowed to walk near the water,"" said Vansh, a resident of Mumbai.

The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) has issued a high tide alert warning people to not go near the beaches.

21,21,FL-2014-000080-CHN,"Chetwoods creates ""blatantly iconic"" kilometre-tall tower for Wuhan - Dezeen",https://www.dezeen.com/2014/06/16/chetwoods-designs-1km-tall-phoenix-towers-for-wuhan-china/,"News: British studio Chetwoods has unveiled a proposal to create the world's tallest tower in the Chinese city of Wuhan, with a host of environmental functions that will attempt to purify the city's polluted air and lakes.

The Phoenix towers, the tallest of which reaches a kilometre at its highest point, were commissioned by China's Hua Yan Group to be an ""iconic"" attraction for a 47 hectare master plan occupying an island in one of Wuhan's many lakes.

When completed, the larger will be the world's tallest structure, towering over 150 metres above the world's highest building, the Burj Khalifa.

Based on a 2009 competition-winning proposal Chetwoods developed for creating a new bridge in London, the firm was asked to create a proposal that could incorporate large-scale environmental functions as well as provide a focal point for a three kilometre long avenue.

The tallest of the two towers contains multiple filtration systems for cleaning the water from the lake and the surrounding air as well as solar electricity plants.

The second structure features a perforated facade with a louvre system for ventilation and light control and contains a vast vertical garden as well as restaurants, galleries, bars and other leisure facilities. The towers will occupy a seven-hectare space.

""In China if you come up with a slightly mad idea, its almost not mad enough,"" studio founder Laurie Chetwood told Dezeen. ""It's the opposite of the UK.""

""It was blatantly iconic,"" said Chetwood. ""They wanted to take the Eiffel Tower experience on a stage further. It doesn't just stand there and become an iconic symbol of Wuhan, it has to do a job. We've applied as many environmental ideas as we possibly could to justify the shape and the size of them.""

Both towers, which have been created in collaboration with engineers WSP, have a steel superstructure and concrete core and base.

The bottom of each tower has been designed to emulate the raised root system of a mangrove tree, with buttresses connecting each structure to the ground creating an open space underneath and around the base for tourist-focused functions.

""The Chinese are very commercially minded, as you can imagine,"" said Chetwood. ""This is a big tourist idea right in one of the largest lakes in Wuhan. They've turned on to the environmental idea but there's always obviously the commercial element at the base of it.""

Only half of the taller tower will be habitable, with the upper portion devoted to mechanical functions. It is being designed to act as a ""thermal chimney"", with the top being heated by the sun and drawing cool air up through its filtration systems.

""We will do the same with the water, so the water is drawn up through the tower, it's cleansed and then put back into the lake,"" explained Chetwood, adding that the height of the tower would play a key part in its functionality.

""It had to be something pretty stunning to catch the eye from three kilometres away. But there is quite a lot in the height that is not just showcasing, a lot of it is to do with the environmental side as well.""

Other environmental features include photovoltaic cladding, wind turbines, biomass boilers and hydrogen fuel cells.

The design of the towers is based on symbolism around the mythological Fenghuang – the Chinese phoenix, which is represented by both a male and a female bird.

""It's a fairly stereotypical image,"" explained Chetwood who said that the taller tower was the male, containing most of the active environmental functions and feeding clean, cooled air and water and electricity into the more ""passive"" female tower.

Chetwood said the design was also a response to some of the criticism about Western architects creating projects in China that did not bear any relation to local context.

""It's a force for good really because there's been quite a lot of criticism of these Western-driven designs, almost irresponsible design,"" he said. ""This is meant to be embracing the culture with the phoenix/dragons idea but it's also doing a really top environmental job and taking into account environmental factors around the towers.""

Chetwood expects the project to start on site within the next year and take at least three years to complete.

At the end of last year, Dutch architecture firm 3XN completed a shopping centre in Wuhan, with a facade covered in silver balls.

In 2011, Adrian Smith and Gordon Gill began work on site for a kilometre tall skyscraper in Jeddah. With more habitable space than Chetwood's towers, the Kingdom Tower will be the world's tallest building.","Mon, 16 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2014/06/Chetwoods-Pheonix-Towers_dezeen_sq.jpg,"['kilometretall', 'idea', 'wuhan', 'iconic', 'tower', 'towers', 'chetwoods', 'worlds', 'tallest', 'water', 'functions', 'environmental', 'creates', 'chetwood', 'blatantly']",

We can’t prevent global shortages of drinking water while providing enough food and energy to meet the needs of a growing population in a climate-constrained world if we don’t understand the linkages between water, energy and food security. Here’s a look at how our demands for energy, food and water all drive each other, and how we can prevent them from driving in the wrong direction.

11 June 2014 | India is one of the world’s biggest users of groundwater, but the aquifers that store much of its freshwater are overused, slow to replenish and rapidly depleting. That’s because the country’s rapidly-expanding middle class has boosted its farms, which are stretching its water resources beyond capacity. The same thing is happening in energy, which uses water for cooling thermal power plants. If India doesn’t address its water challenges, it won’t be able to support its growth in both the food and energy sector – and thus its evolution as a nation.

And the country is far from alone. In China, where water distribution is woefully imbalanced, the dry desert-like north contains most of the croplands but only 16% of the freshwater. Natural resources are constrained throughout the nation, and the extraction activities that do take place have a big impact on groundwater and other water sources by significantly depleting them. Energy development often competes with the agriculture sector for water use.

Likewise in the United States, large-scale agriculture projects in California earn billions of dollars but also require enormous amounts of water – which, in a place like California, is in short supply. And demands for energy development factor in here, too – with different forms of energy extraction underway across the state, including hydraulic fracturing (fracking) – the natural gas extraction practice that pumps millions of gallons of water, sand and other chemicals into the ground to bust open shale formations to access the energy source inside.

Each of these regions – and, indeed, every part of the world – are caught in the “water-energy-food-nexus”. And because the challenges are becoming increasingly interdependent, integrated solutions that involve cross sector collaboration must be adopted. The concept is complex, but at its core, the nexus focuses on natural resource scarcity and management.

Understanding the Nexus

Ultimately, “nexus thinking” means implementing integrated solutions at an ecosystem or landscape level that enhance security and sustainability in all three sectors.

The food sector part of the nexus is perhaps the simplest to comprehend. Water and energy are both needed to produce food, and agriculture consumes 80% of water resources. As populations and prosperity increase in places like India and China, people will demand more meat, which means a greater demand for corn and soybeans to feed animals. Some argue we’ll see a self-correction as the system implodes, taking with it populations and prosperity, but that’s not a solution – it’s a tragedy.

The interdependence between water and energy is more complex, and we might as well start in California.

The state uses 20% of its electricity to pump, treat and deliver water via the world’s largest public power development and water delivery system, The California State Water Project, which supplies 23 million people in California’s water scarce but populous southern region with drinking water. This involves miles of pipelines, tunnels and canals and includes carrying water 2,000 feet over the Tehachapi Mountains. It’s the largest single user of energy in the state.

Then you have the fact that water is required in basically all forms of energy, and often energy development takes place in areas where water is scarce. Staying in California, we see this in Kern County, where much of the state’s agriculture growth is taking place also. The county has always been a big energy developer containing some of the top producing oil fields in the United States. Now fracking is is in the mix, too, and it consumes roughly 164,000 gallons of water per fracking well. This is common throughout the US. According to a Ceres report, nearly half of all fracking activities happen in water-stressed regions.

But coal is even worse. In a year, a typical coal plant can withdraw up to 180 billion gallons of water and consume up to 4 billion gallons. A 2013 report from the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) projected that water withdrawals would decrease by 80% and consumption by 40% if natural gas supplies 60% of the US’ power. This would hardly solve global water and energy challenges, however, because natural gas extraction is still water-intensive and happening in water stressed regions.

Implications of the Nexus

These events unfolding around the world carry implications for the business-as-usual practices of global companies. And similar to how India’s usage of its groundwater is unsustainable, the current practices of most companies aren’t sustainable either. The changing dynamics of water, energy and food affect business operations thoroughly. A change in price or availability, for example, in one of these commodities impacts a business from its factory floor to its corporate offices.

A recent study found that 60% of the companies surveyed indicated water would negatively affect profitability and growth within the next five years. 80% of respondents said the resource will affect where companies’ locate facilities.

The drought that took hold of Texas in 2011 directly contributed to shuttered operations – like a meat processing plant in Plainview – and job loss. It also prevented growth of the power sector despite significant demand for it in the state. There wasn’t enough water available to ensure steady production of electricity. This instability in the energy sector prevented major businesses from locating there.

The water shortages that businesses in Texas struggle with are just one challenge companies face regarding the nexus. Businesses often share water sources with other actors outside of the sector like farmers and local residents. And with multiple users often drawing from the same water source, what one does impacts the other. Fertilizers from farming activities that pollute a watershed can render it unusable for other actions. Realizing that natural resources are shared can encourage competing demands to address the matter holistically at a landscape level.

A landscape approach to the nexus also carries social implications for the local populations and perhaps beyond. Because ecologically friendly farming practices, for example, that preserve a source of clean water for all users also provides sustainable livelihoods for local populations.

This potential sustainability is another aspect of the nexus. Nexus thinking can provide stability and promote political and economic security for societies while poor resource management can generate quite the opposite. Disagreements over water management in water-scarce regions like the Middle East has led to conflicts between neighbors. In North Africa, for instance, Ethiopia is aiming for energy self-sufficiency with construction of the continent’s largest hydroelectric dam on the Nile River. But the river is essentially a source of life for Egyptians-83 million people rely on it for almost all of their water needs. Egyptian officials claim the nation will lose 20-30% of its Nile water and nearly a third of power generated from its own hydroelectric dam. Ethiopia hopes to finish the project by 2017 but in the meantime, relations between the two nations have soured. Egypt even threatens military action if construction of the dam isn’t stopped.

This situation isn’t new. Still within the Middle East, Iraq lost its once ample supply of freshwater flowing from the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers to Turkey when it constructed dams upstream.

The Middle East isn’t the only region trying to grow its energy capacity. Other emerging economies in Africa and Asia are doing the same. Demand for energy is expected to rise 70% by 2035, according to a UN report on world water and energy. And while bringing electricity to the 1.3 billion people who lack it is a positive, the report says, the water required in the process isn’t valued economically so its limitations are ignored. Sources are stressed and depleted. The report also predicts an increase in water resource-related conflicts unless integrated-or at least more innovative-approaches are adopted.

Nature and the Nexus

With the political, social and economic implications of the water-energy-food nexus, it’s easy to overlook the nexus’ natural component. The nexus is part of nature. Each sector requires healthy ecosystems in order to function sustainably. Ecosystem services that purify water and mitigate scarcity ease the severity of droughts and floods and make food and energy production more reliable. Incorporating nature into the nexus means integrating natural infrastructure like mangroves and coral reefs, which protect coastal regions from hurricanes, into nexus management. Other examples of natural infrastructure that would benefit water, energy and food security include wetlands and floodplains that lower flood peaks and forests that filter and store water.

A report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature encourages the integration of nature into infrastructure investment creating a mixed portfolio of both natural and grey infrastructure that complements each other. The report notes a combined system of green and grey solutions would deliver the best results in terms of cost-effectiveness, risk and sustainable development.

To demonstrate how well natural infrastructure can work, there is the now famous example of New York City conserving the forests and wetlands of Catskill watersheds in order to maintain water quality and ensure a clean drinking water supply for NYC residents.

Likewise, ignoring natural infrastructure and relying completely on engineered systems often results in unhealthy ecosystems with a low productivity rate of ecosystem services. Dams built in Nigeria’s Komadugu Yobe Basin affected the flow of water downstream reducing the flooding season farmers relied on to water their crops. Invasive weeds flourished choking waterways and ruining pastoral and agricultural lands and fisheries. The dams were built to store water for agriculture and drinking purposes but investment in the project didn’t materialize leaving ecosystems degraded and a population vulnerable to food insecurity.

Solutions to Nexus Challenges

Integrating natural infrastructure into management of the nexus is one solution that can have a big impact on the sustainability of all three sectors.

Answers to the nexus challenge rely on efficiency and cross-sector collaboration at a landscape-level. Solutions using a framework that encompasses these elements are being considered and implemented throughout the world.

In terms of efficiency, there have been solid attempts in all three sectors to increase its levels. Referring again to the UCS report on US power production, the study highlights the importance of transitioning development toward more efficient water-smart techniques. If the US were to follow a trajectory of water-smart power development, water withdrawals would decline by 97% by 2050 and consumption would be reduced by 85%-not to mention power sector carbon emissions would drop 90% below current levels. The technology and resources are available for this transition to happen.

These water-smart techniques the UCS is supporting include renewable energy. India, struggling with its overworked power grid, is also exploring renewables as one way to relieve some of the strain and increase efficiency. The government is looking to swap groundwater pumps powered by diesel fuel and the outdated power system with solar water pumps. Farmers receive subsidies to buy the solar pumps and in exchange agree to practice water-saving drip irrigation.

Not only does the initiative in India mean less water used for energy, it could also mean less water for producing food. Efficiency in producing food is a necessary component of nexus solutions. Reducing waste and growing more food on already cultivated land are two of the steps National Geographic lays out for feeding Earth’s rising population. An entire step focuses on efficient resource use highlighting techniques like cover crops, mulching and composting, that build up nutrients in the soil and conserve water. Innovative technology grows in the food sector as well. Computerized tractors with GPS allow farmers to better target the application of fertilizers and pesticides minimizing runoff into nearby waterways.

The private sector is also heavily involved in the spread of efficient and innovative solutions. The rising interest in natural capital among businesses is helping to guide nexus thinking along as more companies become aware of their dependence and risks regarding the natural world and begin to take action. Big companies like AT&T and Hershey are making changes-upgrading outdated cooling systems and investing in conservation technology.

There is a gradual increase in companies addressing the nexus and managing their water risk. A recent report found that one in four watershed investment projects counted a business as a financial supporter. Companies are in partnerships with NGOs and governments over watershed protection and restoration activities, which address challenges on a large scale.

But further collaboration on this large scale level is needed in order to truly address and change the way society addresses its water use and energy and food production. And while change is often slow to happen, initial steps of understanding the water-energy-food nexus and coming to terms with the world’s reliance on it can happen immediately.","Wed, 11 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/img_1435.jpg,"['infrastructure', 'solutions', 'waterenergyfood', 'report', 'power', 'sector', 'natural', 'food', 'water', 'companies', 'challenges', 'energy', 'nexus', 'interlinked']",

60,000 unaccompanied juveniles expected to cross in 2014, Border Patrol official says

""Consulates can't keep up,"" and they're ""in limbo,"" Department of Homeland Security official says

Obama calls it an ""urgent humanitarian situation""

In broad daylight, with no fear of being seen, a group of Honduran girls -- some as young as 14 -- cross illegally into the United States.

""Because I want to see my parents in Austin,"" one tells CNN.

Moments later, another group of Hondurans admits crossing the Rio Grande to get here, McAllen station, a border crossing into the United States. ""Thank God nothing happened,"" they say of the perilous journey.

This group quickly grows to 22. Most are children who traveled without any adults.

Unlike other stories of illegal immigration across a porous border, these immigrants aren't sneaking in. They're showing up and announcing themselves.

""We are seeing hundreds turning themselves in daily. And I mean hundreds at a time,"" said Chris Cabrera, a leader of the local chapter of the National Border Patrol Council, a labor union representing U.S. Border Patrol agents.

Many of the immigrants use rafts to cross the Rio Grande, equipped with instructions to follow the river until reaching the Border Patrol site to surrender.

""They know that once they get to the station, we are going to give them paperwork and we are going to set them free into the United States,"" Cabrera says.

U.S. law prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from immediately deporting the children if they are not from Canada or Mexico. Instead, the children are turned over to Department Health and Human Services supervision ""within 72 hours of DHS taking them into custody,"" an official said.

""Most of the time, they're getting released to relatives in the U.S.,"" Cabrera said. ""There's nowhere to put them, so they're released on their own recognizance and have a pending court date. I'd say between 95 and 97% of adults or youths don't show up for court.""

The numbers are staggering. He estimates that more than 60,000 unaccompanied juveniles will cross in 2014 and that the numbers will rise from there.

""You're talking kids from 17 years old, on down to some that are 5 or 6 years old, traveling by themselves,"" Cabrera says.

Last year, roughly 10% of people caught by Border Patrol agents were minors, according to a Border Patrol official.

Texas has been so overwhelmed that federal officials are transporting busloads of immigrants, including minors, to Arizona.

Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer slammed the move. ""Not only does the federal government have no plan to stop this disgraceful policy, it also has no plan to deal with the endless waves of illegal aliens once they are released here,"" she said in a statement

As of late last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement was no longer releasing ""large family groups"" at bus stops in Arizona, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman said, but children under age 17 are continuing to be transferred to the state.

""The situation with the kids are they came by themselves, they have no relatives here, and the consulates can't keep up. They're in limbo. There's no one (back home) to deport them to,"" a DHS spokesman told CNN.

Obama: 'Urgent humanitarian situation'

President Barack Obama declared the crossings ""an urgent humanitarian situation requiring a unified and coordinated federal response.""

Earlier this month, in a memo to the heads of executive departments and agencies, he announced an ""interagency Unified Coordination Group to ensure unity of effort across the executive branch in responding to the humanitarian aspects of this situation."" The group will oversee coordination with state, local and other agencies.

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is establishing the group. In a statement , he said that ""addressing the rising flow of unaccompanied children crossing our southwest border is an important priority of this administration and the Department of Homeland Security.""

Border facilities don't have enough food, beds or sanitary facilities to provide for the children.

Johnson vowed that DHS and other agencies will coordinate to ensure a ""rapid government-wide response in the short-term and to undertake broader, longer-term reforms to address the root cause behind these recent migration trends.""

Senior administration officials said they had prepared for a greater influx of children across the Southwest border, but the numbers were much larger than anticipated in past weeks.

Administration officials would not offer specifics on the number of children in custody, most of whom are being processed for possible repatriation to their home countries.

Why now?

Numerous factors have come together to create this unprecedented surge.

Many children are looking to escape violence and worsening economic conditions in their Central American countries. Some want to reunite with their parents who left them behind with relatives and plan to return for them when they can. Better weather is also cited as a factor leading some immigrants to decide to make the trek now.

Cabrera says these crossings began to spike two years ago after the Obama administration announced it would stop deporting young illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children if they met certain requirements.

Political battle

Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, calls the situation ""an administration-made disaster.""

""Word has gotten out around the world about President Obama's lax immigration enforcement policies and it has encouraged more individuals to come to the United States illegally,"" he said in a statement.

Columnist Linda Valdez, who writes about the issue for CNN affiliate azcentral.com , blames both sides. Goodlatte is ""a card-carrying member of the Republican majority that has blocked immigration reform,"" she says. And ""Obama isn't off the hook. He's been quietly managing disaster instead of yelling 'fire' in this burning building.""

The children flocking across the border in search of the American dream ""shouldn't come,"" she says. But they ""wouldn't come if their undocumented parents didn't find it so easy to work in a country that loves cheap labor -- but treats cheap laborers like a disposable commodity.""","Tue, 10 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140610065515-newday-dnt-pamela-brown-undocumented-minors-00000000-story-top.jpg,"['vows', 'border', 'illegally', 'children', 'theyre', 'urgent', 'obama', 'united', 'immigrants', 'flock', 'patrol', 'states', 'group', 'department', 'immigration', 'action']",

28,28,FL-2014-000080-CHN,Can Pampanga’s last defense against lahar match severe rains? - Inquirer.net,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/610257/can-pampangas-last-defense-against-lahar-match-severe-rains,"CITY OF SAN FERNANDO, Philippines— The durability of the FVR Megadike has been put on the spotlight in the run-up to the 23rd anniversary of Mount Pinatubo’s 1991 eruption and amid forecast of strong typhoons that will follow the El Niño weather phenomenon until early next year.

“Given the high volume of rainfall to be expected, the FVR Megadike must be observed and analyzed if it is still competent in holding floodwaters,” Noel Lacadin, chief geologist of the Mines and Geosciences Bureau in Central Luzon region, said at a summit of the Pampanga Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council on June 5.

The FVR Megadike, named after former President Fidel V. Ramos, was built after lahar, or volcanic sediments remobilized by rain, overflowed from the Pasig-Potrero River on Oct. 1, 1995, burying Bacolor town.

The U-shaped, 56-kilometer long structure turned 17 Bacolor villages into a large catch basin of lahar. The megadike is considered Pampanga province’s last defense when it was completed with a transverse dike in 1997.

Since then, it has undergone retrofitting, with the government spending P3 billion to strengthen it, said Isabelita Manalo, assistant project director of the Department of Public Works and Highways’ (DPWH) Unified Project Management Office-Flood Control Management Cluster.

Manalo said she was confident that the megadike “can withstand ‘Ondoy’-like typhoons.”

Tropical Storm “Ondoy” struck in 2009, causing severe flooding in Metro Manila and nearby provinces.

But the megadike, Manalo said, needed repair at its western section covering Porac, Sta. Rita and Guagua towns at a cost of P45.1 million this July.

Spillways 1 and 3, at a budget of more than P500 million, are now being built to divide the flow of the Pasig-Potrero River to the eastern and western channels.

Pampanga Gov. Lilia Pineda said she had asked the DPWH to consider the safety of people in the plan to divert the water to the western channel.

The FVR Megadike, she said, has served its purpose, which was to save the capital of San Fernando and outlying towns.

“The problem now is at the downstream,” she said, referring to towns along the tributary of the Pasig-Potrero River that drains out to the Pampanga Bay and finally, Manila Bay.

But basic questions about the megadike remain unanswered.

Now 17 years old, the megadike’s life-span is unknown. After the 1995 lahar breakout and at an original budget of P900 million, the DPWH sent earth-moving machines to the Pasig-Potrero River to clear its silted waterways. The earth dikes became the precursors of the megadike, a DPWH source said.

The integrity of the megadike is shadowed by its past.

“The megadike, which the Kapampangans regard as a monument to their heroic efforts to convince a frustrated and financially exhausted national government to go out on a limb for Pampanga, had instead become another symbol of government ineptitude and folly,” wrote local historian Robby Tantingco.

He was referring to the “innumerable cases of corruption that made the plight of the Kapampangans even more tragic.”

Kelvin Rodolfo, a geologist and professor emeritus at the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago, doubted the strength of the megadike because, he said, “it is basically built using lahar, which is loose compared to soil.”

Also, there were no fresh data on what remained of the sediments that the volcano spewed out in its catastrophic blasts in June 1991. Information on this could help local governments anticipate lahar remobilization, Rodolfo said.

Turning the eastern megadike into an asphalted road may need rethinking, a businessman said.

Manalo said the maintenance of the megadike rested on the shoulders of the DPWH office in Central Luzon.

The Pampanga Chamber of Commerce and Industry in 2013 asked the DPWH regional office to assess the safety of the megadike against floods and lahar. The latter did not make its findings public.

Antonio Molano, DPWH regional director, did not reply to queries on Tuesday.

Rodolfo said the government and residents near the volcano should watch out for certain things aside from the megadike.

“If the pattern of previous eruption cycles will be followed, smaller eruptions of lava eventually will fill the caldera and form a new, high-standing dome. But we don’t know how many, or how large, these dome-building eruptions will be, and how long this dome-building will last,” he wrote in a 2011 report.

He said no one could say with certainty if the lahar threat was over.

“Looking elsewhere for clues, the Santa Maria volcano in Guatemala is situated in a humid tropical climate very similar to ours. The Santa Maria eruption in 1902 had the same magnitude as that of Pinatubo in 1991. Significant [lahar flows] occurred at Santa Maria for the next 22 years,” Rodolfo said.

He noted that “great volumes of deposits left by past [lahar flows] may not have all found their final resting places.”

“We must keep in mind that lahar deposits have often been remobilized into new lahar by well-placed typhoons at Mayon, Pinatubo and other volcanoes,” he said.

He also said residents of Botolan, Castillejos and San Marcelino towns in Zambales province “must continue to monitor the state of the dikes, must be especially vigilant during bad weather, and must have contingency plans when large typhoons approach.”

29,29,FL-2014-000080-CHN,What's Holding Back the India-EU FTA? - the Diplomat,https://thediplomat.com/2014/06/whats-holding-back-the-india-eu-fta/,"Advertisement

The EU-28 is India’s largest trading partner, accounting for roughly 15 percent of total trade in goods and services. It is an important market for India’s export of textiles, apparel, pharmaceuticals, gems, jewelry and IT. The EU is also the largest source of FDI inflows to India, accounting for over one-fourth of the total.

Despite several rounds of negotiations that began in 2007, the proposed EU-India Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA), covering trade in merchandise, services, and investment, is still far from being concluded. The recent EU ban on the import of mangoes from India will further strain the bilateral commercial relationship, which is already troubled due to a series of tax disputes involving European companies.

Given the subdued sentiment around foreign investment and trade currently, restoring growth to its normal level remains at the top of the Modi government’s agenda. This would require a fresh approach toward India’s commerce and trade. It would be pertinent to analyze what is holding back the conclusion of the EU-India trade pact, which possesses immense untapped trade and investment possibilities.

India’s Interests

Given the contribution of the service sector to GDP (57 percent), India is seeking improved market access in services. India’s interests lie in Mode 1 of the BTIA, which covers information technology enabled services (ITES), business process outsourcing (BPO), and knowledge process outsourcing (KPO), and Mode 4 which covers movement of skilled professionals like software engineers.

A recent Reserve Bank of India (RBI) survey on computer software and ITES exports shows that Europe’s share in India’s software exports declined from 27 percent in fiscal 2008 to 20 percent in fiscal 2013. The share of Mode-4 services in overall software service exports declined from 25 percent in fiscal 2008 to 14 percent in fiscal 2013.

Improved market access in Mode 4 will allow skilled professionals such as software engineers to temporarily reside and work in EU countries. The barriers to Mode 4 include work permits, wage-parity conditions, visa formalities and non-recognition of professional qualifications.

India also seeks a data secure status from the EU, as the high cost of compliance with existing EU’s data protection laws and procedures renders Indian small and medium enterprises (SMEs) un-competitive.

EU’s Interests

The EU’s demands in India’s Mode 3 services includes further liberalization of FDI in multi-brand retail and insurance, and presently closed sectors like accountancy and legal services. The European banks have been eyeing India’s relatively underutilized banking space. However, the surrender of banking licenses by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS shows that the burden of priority sector lending and financial inclusion have dissuaded foreign banks from entering India’s market.

India’s intellectual property regime (IPR) is another impediment. Any commitment over and above the WTO’s Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) will undermine India’s capacity to produce generic formulations. It is feared that data exclusivity protection measures (which allow pharmaceutical companies to exclusively retain rights to their test results for a certain period) would delay the supply of Indian generic medicines. That explains India’s opposition to the proposal. European pharmaceutical companies are wary of India’s patents law which prevents “ever greening” – a provision that allows companies to renew patents on old drugs by making incremental changes.

Cars and Wines/Sprits

Again, India has reduced duties on parts and components, and other vehicles, but maintains high import duties on assembled vehicles: 60 percent (75 percent in cars with a free on board (fob) value above $40,000 and an engine capacity of 3000 cc for petrol and 2500 cc for diesel). This protectionism remains the most contentious issue in the BTIA negotiations.

The EU also seeks deeper cuts in India’s tariffs on wines and spirits. They feel that high effective duties and additional state-level taxes inflate the price of imported liquor in India. However duties on wines and spirits are a critical source of tax revenue for the government.

Trade in Agricultural Commodities

Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.

Agricultural trade is highly distorted in both the EU and India. Even though average most favored nation (MFN) import duties on agricultural commodities in the EU (13 percent) are much lower than in India (33 percent), the EU’s peak tariff rates on certain products such as dairy (650 percent), fruits and vegetables (156 percent), and sugar & confectionary (133 percent) are more than those in India.

Again, the fishery and dairy sectors in the EU are highly subsidized. There is a fear of EU dairy products flooding Indian markets after the FTA is signed. India wants the EU to cut its agricultural subsidies, while the EU has interest in India reducing tariffs on dairy products, poultry, farms and fisheries. Thus, both India and the EU have strong defensive interests with respect to agriculture trade negotiations.

Reconciling the Differences

To be fair, the EU does not have a single market for labor mobility. Regulations related to work permits and visas differ between members. There were efforts to harmonize the EU market through various directives, but they have met with limited success. Moreover the EU’s unemployment problems have reduced policy space for Mode 4 commitments.

India’s demand for greater market access in Mode 1 and 4 remains dependent on its ability to meet the EU’s demands in Mode 3. Strong opposition and a lack of political will on FDI in retail and insurance undermines India’s negotiating capacity.

Car manufacturers in India, primarily of Japanese and Korean origin, fear that reduced duties on cars under the EU-India BTIA will impact their market share and flood India with European cars. Additionally, there are fears that European automakers will have no incentive to set up a local manufacturing base in India. This is debatable though, as almost all major European automakers already have a manufacturing presence in India.

Could European carmakers compete in India’s compact car segment (comprising 80 percent of India’s auto market) by producing in Europe? Studies show that it’s difficult to succeed in India without a strong dealer network and reliable after-sales service. A prohibitive duty on cars looks unjustified when duties on non-car automobile segments have been substantially reduced. This also deprives consumers of choices.

Improving India’s investment climate is a better way to promote investment and jobs. Similarly, exclusive rights to the commercial exploitation of patents incentivizes research and development and brings in FDI. Thus, India needs to strengthen its IPR regime.

A trade pact is about give and take. Failure to conclude the EU-India BTIA will constitute a large opportunity loss, while trade pacts such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) (which together account for two-thirds of global GDP and one third of global imports) are moving global trade away from MFN routes toward bilateral/regional routes. They are setting new trade rules that would be far more difficult to comply with. This calls for taking a long-term view of India’s trade policy options while negotiating its trade pacts.

BY PETER OKUTU, Abakaliki

Disaster-prone communities in Ebonyi State now have reason to heave a sigh of relief following the intervention initiative of the Federal Government through the World Bank supported Ebonyi State chapter of Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project, NEWMAP, which was officially launched at the Women Development Centre, Abakaliki, last weekend.

It could be recalled that during last year’s rainy season that lasted between April and September , about 332,938 persons were displaced by flood in communities which cut across the 13 local government areas of the state.

Also, in the past few years, erosion and gullies arising from this seasonal flooding have increasingly caused untold adversity to the state, including loss of lives, sack of villages and offices, destruction of homes, farmlands and public infrastructure. Indeed studies showed that the total economic loss caused by flooding and erosion problems in the last five years in the state ran into billions of Naira, excluding loss of lives.

It is worthy to note that the emergence of NEWMAP came about as a result of the baseline survey of critical impact of erosion in Nigeria which showed that the South Eastern part of the country was in imminent danger. Gully erosion, it has been revealed, contributed to environmental degradation and other associated damages estimated at millions of dollars annually.

The Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project, NEWMAP development objective, aims to reduce vulnerability to soil erosion in targeted sub-catchments. This eight-year innovative, multi-sectoral project will finance state-led interventions to prevent and reverse land degradation, initially focusing on gully erosion sites that threatened infrastructure and livelihoods in seven states: Abia, Anambra, Cross River, Ebonyi, Edo, Enugu and Imo. It will subsequently scale out to other states nationwide.

Speaking during the official launch of NEWMAP in the state and the entire South East geopolitical zone, Ebonyi State Governor, Martin Elechi, reiterated that the World Bank Nigeria office response to Federal Government’s demand for grants to checkmate the challenges of gully erosion and environmental insecurity in the country was what gave rise to NEWMAP.

He said: “We are here today not only to officially flag-off this transformative NEWMAP intervention, but also to open a new chapter of expected development partnership with the World Bank. The launch today symbolises our compete resolve as affected and also benefiting state to deal with the menace of erosion and other environmental hazards in a concerted manner with the support of World Bank.

”At this juncture, let me use the opportunity of this flag-off to thank the World Bank for making available the sum of $2 million for the commencement of the projects in the state. I understand that the

fund is replenishable on draw down for the sustainability of the programme.

“I have equally been briefed that out of five priority projects selected by our state, one is ready for procurement award

while the remaining four will follow shortly.”

In a remark, Ebonyi State NEWMAP Project Coordinator, Dr. Philip Echiegu expressed delight over the inauguration and establishment of NEWMAP in the state, adding that the development would go a long way to providing both immediate and future solutions to the problems posed by flooding and erosion across the state. The State Commissioner for Environment and Chairman, State Steering Committee, David Egbu thanked the state government for providing the enabling platform for the realisation of the project in the state.

”The state by its peculiarity faces this challenge in two major prongs: erosion and flood. The largely low lying nature of the soil and the predominantly shell formation in the north and central parts

of the state, impair quick permeability of water and easy run off after rains, resulting to water logging and flooding. While the inherent characteristics of weak cemented sand grains predisposes the southern part to intense gully erosion. These hazards led to inestimable loss of lives and property”.

The Task Team Leader, NEWMAP, Dr. Amos Abu enjoined all the benefiting states to ensure that they meet up with the qualification criteria so as to participate in investment activities provided by NEWMAP. “The participating states must qualify to benefit from NEWMAP investment activities. All participating states will be eligible to participate in institutional capacity and technical assistance activities, as these will contribute to meeting qualification criteria to participate in investment activities.”

Reacting to the launch, the Chairman of Afikpo South local government area of the state, Ogbonnaya Orji expressed optimism that the launch of NEWMAP in the state would reverse the menace of erosion and flood and turn the erstwhile areas from sites of hazards to points of assets in the near future.

| June 16. 2014.10:41

UK homes are using less energy than they used to. Demand for energy had been rising inexorably for decades, but has fallen about 11 per cent over the last ten years. So what changed? And will the trend continue?

At a conference last week energy secretary Ed Davey spoke of his desire to create an “energy saving society”. Homes are using around a fifth less energy than they were in 2004, he said, and still more could be done.

A minor quibble with Davey’s figure is that overall household energy demand in 2013 – the latest year available – was only 11 per cent below 2004 levels. Only in the particularly warm year in 2011 was demand 20 per cent down.

Still, demand really is falling. This is particularly impressive as the number of households is 6 per cent higher than it was in 2004.

Falling demand

The chart below shows that UK household electricity use peaked in 2005 (blue lines). UK household gas use (pink lines) peaked a year earlier, in 2004. DECC now produces adjusted figures that account for higher energy needs in cold weather. These adjustments (darker lines) smooth out temperature effects.

It’s worth noting that UK homes use about three times more energy from gas (right axis) than from electricity (left axis). So falling gas demand has had a much bigger overall impact.

High-level head-scratching

The drop in demand is causing some high-level head-scratching. There are plenty of ideas about what the reasons might be, but much less clarity about which is most important.

“The short answer is that no-one knows,” says Guy Newey, head of energy and environment for centre-right thinktank Policy Exchange. He looked into the question last year but did not find good data.

The head of energy regulator Ofgem Dermot Nolan says “energy usage is falling but it’s not well understood how or why.” Energy efficiency improvements are part of the reason, he suggests.

The Committee on Climate Change tells Carbon Brief:

“We know that falling demand is combination of economic weakness, energy efficiency policy, higher energy prices and, possibly, non-price behaviour change – but questions remain around the relative contributions of those.”

To try and assess the different factors, we’ve taken a look into this treasure trove of data from DECC, and identified a number of things that are cutting energy use.

Energy-efficient appliances

This chart shows the energy rating of installed home refrigerators from A++ down to G. The growing number of more efficient A-rated appliances (blue wedges) replacing old, unrated models (grey area) means that the nation’s fridges are getting more efficient.

A similar pattern can be seen for many other white goods such as ovens, dishwashers and washing machines.

A lot of the change is down to manufacturers building more efficient models. Cost and desirability tend to trump energy efficiency when consumers make a purchase, according to National Grid head of energy strategy and policy Richard Smith.

Still, some consumers will be making use of EU-mandated energy labelling rules to buy greener models in the expectation that they will use less power and so be cheaper to run. Last year John Lewis started labelling goods with their lifetime running costs to make this point more forcefully.

Bye-bye incandescent lightbulbs

Lighting efficiency has improved particularly rapidly over the past decade because of EU rules that banned inefficient incandescent bulbs, forcing a shift to compact fluorescents. Halogen lamps will be next to be phased out, while super-efficient LEDs are becoming cheaper and more popular.

The amount of energy used by home lighting fell by 4,000 gigawatt hours (22 per cent) between 2000 and 2012 according to Oxford University energy expert Dr Brenda Boardman. As LEDs grab more market share this could fall another 90 per cent, she says.

For all that extra efficiency there are some countervailing pressures. Electricity demand for home electronics and computers was up 17 and 45 per cent respectively between 2004 and 2012, for instance.

Remember though that electricity use is only a small part of home energy demand. The chart below shows home energy demand according to use. It is based on modelling because accurate figures are not available and each home is different.

However everyone agrees that heating rooms (dark blue) and water (light blue) uses the lion’s share.

More insulation, better boilers

The chart below shows estimated home energy efficiency ratings for the UK’s housing stock. 70 per cent of homes in 2012 scored a ‘D’ or above (blue areas) compared to just 45 per cent in 2008. The proportion of homes rated E, F or G is shrinking (purple areas). So UK homes seem to be getting more efficient over time.

Source: English Housing Survey 2013, DECC and Fuel Poverty Report 2014, DECC

Energy efficiency rating improvements are mainly down to a combination of better insulation, more double glazing and newer boilers. The proportion of lofts with recommended 125 millimetres of insulation increased by 60 per cent in the five years to 2013 for instance.

And an increasing proportion of homes have efficient condensing gas boilers. This chart shows the number of UK home with different types of boiler. Since around 2004 efficient condensing boilers (blue wedge) have been increasingly replacing older standard boilers and combi boilers that heat water and rooms (pink and purple areas):

Rarely noted regulations mean new boilers are much more energy efficient. Replacing old, inefficient boilers has saved 30,000 gigawatt hours of energy each year since 2005 according to National Grid. That’s 9 per cent of current domestic gas demand. This annual saving could rise to 40,000 gigawatt hours each year by 2030.

Most of the improvement in average home energy efficiency ratings must be coming through retrofits of older homes. New-build houses are typically much more energy efficient. But the chart below shows the age of construction of the UK’s housing stock – with new-build (blue wedge) adding to, not replacing old stock in purple.

The change in home energy efficiency ratings should have reduced the energy needs per square metre of each home by around a quarter between 2008 and 2012. In fact, home gas demand fell by around this amount over a slightly different time period from 2005 to 2011 (pink bars, below).

The cost of keeping warm

One obvious reason why energy use might fall is rising prices. The chart below shows that electricity prices (blue) and those for gas (purple) have risen sharply since around 2004.

Source: Monthly energy price statistics, DECC

Rising prices may well have led people to use less. As prices rose, the overall fall in gas demand (purple bars, above) was greatest for middle income households. High income homes were probably more able to absorb the extra cost of rising prices without changing their behaviour. And low income households may have been unable to make large cuts because a certain amount of heat, hot water and gas for cooking is close to essential.

There could be other reasons: Middle income homes may have installed more energy efficiency measures than others, or may have been wasting more energy before, and had more potential to save energy by being careful.

But there are certainly indicators that the economic crisis has played an important part in curtailing energy use. Relatively speaking lower income households have seen their gas use fall by a larger proportion than any other group. Fuel Poverty Advisory Group head Derek Lickorish says there was a 29 per cent increase in excess winter deaths last year, a third of which were due to fuel poverty. He has doubts over how much of the recent reduction in energy demand is due to energy efficiency, as compared to an increase in fuel poverty.

The latest official fuel poverty statistics show that the amount of fuel poverty has indeed risen in line with rising prices since 2004, though the number of homes affected has remained relatively steady.

Past performance is not an indicator of future results

Uncertainty remains over the reason for falling domestic energy demand because weighing up the relative impact of all these different factors is really difficult. For instance Richard Smith, National Grid head of energy strategy and policy, tells Carbon Brief:

“What proportion of reduced gas demand is down to insulation versus better boilers is hard to judge. If I had to say I’d go for boilers.”

He thinks both will be important in future, as will lighting. Behaviour change could be significant but Smith is unsure when it will happen at a big enough scale to have an impact. National Grid has done its best to add up past changes so that it can begin to estimate future demand. It will produce updated estimates in a few weeks.

Smith says that the link between rising incomes and rising energy use has been breaking in recent years, in part because of uptake of more efficient appliances and lighting, a trend that is expected to continue.

National Grid expects electricity demand to continue falling unless electric vehicle and electric heating start to take off, which may happen towards the 2030s.

Gas demand should fall too, it thinks, as insulation and boiler improvement continue. Household gas use will be between 6 and 12 per cent below 2012 levels in 2020, National Grid thinks. By 2030 it will be between 4 and 25 per cent lower.

Part of this range is because of “considerable uncertainty” over how effective the Green Deal and Energy Company Obligation will be. These are currently the government’s main policies to improve the energy efficiency of existing homes.

Both have had struggles over the past year. Not even DECC expects them to have much impact between now and 2020, when the UK must meet an EU energy efficiency target to have cut demand by 1.5 per cent per year on average relative to the 2010-2012 average.

Instead DECC thinks stricter building regulations will meet much of the UK’s 2020 target. But given the lack of penetration of new build houses in the chart above, this seems optimistic.

Finally the EU is thinking about whether – and how – to introduce a new legally binding energy efficiency target for 2030. This could put a renewed focus on UK energy efficiency policies.","Mon, 16 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.carbonbrief.org/media/305668/demand.png,"['efficient', 'uk', 'homes', 'look', 'efficiency', 'detailed', 'boilers', 'cent', 'gas', 'chart', 'energy', 'using', 'demand']", 
32,32,FL-2014-000080-CHN,The Day We Set the Colorado River Free - Outside Magazine,https://www.outsideonline.com/1928261/day-we-set-colorado-river-free,"On Friday, March 28, 2014, I did something that has been impossible for most of the past 50 years and, by the time you read this, will be again. As photographer Pete McBride snapped photos of me, and two French documentary filmmakers shot footage of him, and an unidentified blue helicopter circled above, I pumped up an inflatable NRS paddleboard, dropped it onto the Colorado River below Morelos Dam, on the Mexico-Arizona border, flopped onto the board, and glided over the cool waters.

What was remarkable about this was not my less-than-graceful launch but the fact that I was launching at all. Morelos, the last of the 12 major dams on the main stem of the “American Nile,” is where you go to watch the Colorado die. Stand on Morelos and look north, toward the United States, and you see a sparkling, reed-fringed river coming at you. Look south and you see an empty channel that twists 100 miles to the sea. After a thousand straws, from Denver to Los Angeles, have sipped the Colorado dry, after 40 million people, 10 million cows, and countless heads of iceberg lettuce have had their fill, the coup de grâce is delivered here at Morelos, where the last 10 percent of the river is shunted into the Reforma Canal and piped west to the Mexicali Valley so we can all eat baby spinach in January.

Thus it has been for more than 50 years. After Glen Canyon Dam was completed in 1966, the Colorado River delta was left for dead. No water, no life. But an unprecedented agreement between the U.S. and Mexico, called Minute 319, changed all that. Over eight weeks, a 105,392-acre-foot pulse flow of water—about 34 billion gallons—would pour through Morelos and down the dry channel. The idea was to mimic the dynamics of the Colorado’s historical spring flood, timed to coincide with the germination of willow and cottonwood seeds. For more than a year, restoration ecologists with Arizona’s Sonoran Institute and Mexico’s leading environmental group, Pronatura, had been planting seedlings and digging channels, concentrating on the low-lying areas where the groundwater was already high enough to support clusters of cottonwoods and willows—and even a few beaver and muskrat. With a little luck, the water would make it far enough down the dry channel to reach these places. With a little more luck, there might be just enough extra water in coming years to keep some of those new seedlings alive.

It was the unlikeliest of plans: take a titanic slug of water from the most over-allocated river in North America, shoot it through some of the driest country on earth, and turn these godforsaken wastelands back into an Eden. And how anyone managed to pull it off is mystifying, because—perhaps you’ve heard—the West is as parched as Mars right now. Here in the heart of the Great Megadrought of 2014, with Lake Mead draining behind Hoover Dam like an unplugged bathtub, farmers scuffling for water like dying men in a life raft, and the Bureau of Reclamation warning Arizona and Nevada to plan on rationing by 2016, somehow $10 million worth of agua pura was being jettisoned.

Take a titanic slug of water from the most over-allocated river in North America, shoot it through some of the driest country on earth, and turn these godforsaken wastelands back into an Eden.

Honestly, nobody knew if it would make it to the sea. Nobody knew what would happen. Nothing like this had ever been tried before. And while scores of scientists from all over the world had descended on the delta to measure the effects on salinity, hydrology, biology, and every other factor they could think of, we were here to take the river’s pulse in an entirely different way. We were going to float it. Dead for decades, would it now feel like a glorified irrigation canal? Or, somewhere in the middle of it all, away from the cameras and piezometers, might we still summon the spirit of the Colorado? Forget the science; we were here for a séance.

Just below the dam, at least, the river truly looked reborn. All but one of Morelos’s 20 gates were wide open, and so much water was pouring down the channel that a lake had formed around the structure. Before a handful of perplexed onlookers, our ragged flotilla of river rats carried a couple of dented aluminum canoes and two inflatable paddleboards to the shores of the instant lake. The water would be sinking into the dry sand over every mile, but for now it was all systems go.

I was with four men, most in their forties, who’d made the Colorado their lives. Fred Phillips, the Flagstaff, Arizona, consultant who’d put the trip together, is the Southwest’s premier restoration ecologist, the man who pioneered the art of transforming barren Colorado riverfront into lush wetlands. Pete McBride grew up on a Colorado ranch that depended on the river. Six years ago, he’d attempted to follow it 1,450 miles to the sea; the resulting book and film are unforgettable testaments to the death throes of the lifeblood of the Southwest. Osvel Hinojosa Huerta, 39, the ecologist in charge of Pronatura’s restoration projects and the region’s preeminent ornithologist, had covered every square mile of the river channel on foot doing bird surveys; he could hardly believe he was about to do it by boat. Sam Walton, a member of the family behind Walmart, had worked for years as a river guide in the Grand Canyon, as well as a hydrologist. He’d assisted Fred on several restoration projects, and the Walton Family Foundation funded some of the pulse-flow-restoration work. Sam had grown skeptical, however, of the pulse-flow strategy—he feared that too much water would simply sink into the dry riverbed, when it could have been channeled directly to restoration sites via canals—and was here to see the results for himself. As it was for all of us, the resurrected Colorado was catnip to him, whatever happened.

Our game plan had been to “start slow, then back off”—we’d be running out of river soon enough—but Sam shot down the channel on a banana-yellow Badfish paddleboard and disappeared, chasing virgin water. The rest of us stuck to the program. Pete glided in a canoe, snapping photos. Fred broke out his guitar and rattled off “The Baggage Boat Blues,” a Fred Phillips original. I paddled upstream until I was above the dam, lay flat on my back, and became maybe the first person to float under the gates since Chris McCandless slipped through here in his canoe in 1990, during one of the last floods to wet the lower Colorado, on his way to the Gulf of California and into the wilds of history. The world felt new.

Days earlier, the world had felt very old to me. Old and exhausted. I’d stood in the center of the parched riverbed and stared at the Mad Max misery of the limitrophe, the 23-mile stretch where the Colorado delineates Mexico from Arizona and where desperate men run the gauntlet to deliver themselves or drugs to the promised land. If you wanted to find a place that symbolized everything that has gone wrong in the delta, this was it. On the U.S. side, the 20-foot-high rusted fence with the halogen spotlights rising above it and Border Patrol trucks stalking the front. Next to it, the bridge in the Mexican city of San Luis Río Colorado arching over the riverbed. The guys in San Luis told me how fishing was their life back in the 1990s, when a few unusually wet years revitalized the river. Bass, carp, corvina. As teenagers they used to jump off the bridge. Kersplash. Now it’s a 35-foot plunge to the dry bed below. Bored teens on ATVs did donuts in the sand, round and round.

I tried to reconcile what I saw with Aldo Leopold’s description of the Colorado River delta in A Sand County Almanac, a towering text of the conservation movement. In 1922, Leopold and his brother paddled up the mouth of the river from the Gulf of California, camping along its braided channels and “deep emerald” waters. Leopold fell hard for the place. “The river was nowhere and everywhere,” he wrote, “for he could not decide which of a hundred green lagoons offered the most pleasant and least speedy path to the Gulf. So he traveled them all, and so did we. He divided and rejoined, he twisted and turned, he meandered in awesome jungles, he all but ran in circles, he dallied with lovely groves, he got lost and was glad of it, and so were we.”

The river Leopold found was a “milk-and-honey wilderness” filled with game “too abundant to hunt,” which Leopold chalked up to the innumerable seedpods hanging in every mesquite tree. “At each bend we saw egrets standing in the pools ahead, each white statue matched by its white reflection. Fleets of cormorants drove their black prows in quest of skittering mullets; avocets, willets, and yellow-legs dozed one-legged on the bars; mallards, widgeons, and teal sprang skyward in alarm.… When a troop of egrets settled on a far green willow, they looked like a premature snowstorm.”

There are few birds here now. Few walls of mesquite and willow. A classic case of unforeseen consequences. The delta gets about two inches of rain per year. It makes Kuwait look like a rainforest. But thanks to its great benefactor, it used to be the ecological jewel of the Southwest. Fed by snowmelt from the Rockies, the Colorado would leap out of its banks each spring to green the delta countryside for miles around. At two million acres, the Colorado River delta was half the size of the Mississippi River’s lower delta and, because it was an oasis in a vast desert, probably even more vital.

Of the hundreds of thousands of acres of riparian forests that once flourished on the lower Colorado, less than 2,000 acres of native willow and cottonwood remain. The rest has turned largely to tamarisk, a mangy, invasive shrub that is one of the only plants that can survive the salty sands of the modern delta. In jeopardy is the entire Pacific Flyway, that billion-bird artery stretching from Alaska to Patagonia, whose travelers must now make the 400-mile death-flap over the Sonoran Desert without food or respite.

Even today, few Americans grasp that the same river that carved Canyonlands and filled Lake Mead also kept Baja and Sonora alive. Back in the era of massive dam building, farmers and city planners were only too happy to see the wild Colorado transformed into a domesticated delivery system. Denver, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Tucson, Albuquerque, Los Angeles, San Diego, Mexicali, and many more municipalities drink the Colorado every day.

As do you. Most of America’s winter veggies are grown in the irrigated valleys of Southern California and Arizona. Your fridge is filled with Colorado River greens. Your beef was fattened on Colorado River alfalfa. Even your milk may well be the Colorado transformed. We all nurse from the mother river.

I’d planned on misery.

I’d thought: The water won’t be that deep.

I’d thought: The water will be gross.

I’d thought: We’ll be clawing our way through tamarisk thickets. Pushing ourselves through flotsam and froth.

I was wrong on all counts.

We ripped downstream on a bona fide river. It was eight feet deep, a hundred feet wide, roiling cool and green in the desert light.

“Is this what you expected?” I asked Osvel.

“It’s better!” he said, grinning from ear to ear. Small, round, and serene, Osvel was like a Buddha in a sombrero—a quality that had endeared him to officials and foundations in two countries. In 2012, he was named a National Geographic Emerging Explorer, and his recent celebrity has meant a lot of time on the road. When you ask Osvel how he likes his new life of meetings and press conferences, he shrugs and smiles and says, “I miss the birds.”

Beneath me, drowned tamarisk trees waved like kelp in the current. We were flying through a forest, the paddleboards our magic carpets. I smacked into the top of the occasional tamarisk, staggering like a drunken pirate, but the river had risen right over the top of most obstacles. An hour into our journey, the river felt very alive. And this entire pulse flow was just 0.7 percent of its annual flow. We were surfing on a rounding error.

Yet this miraculous flood—deemed so important to relations between the two countries that it had elicited a morning of speechifying by everyone from the governor of Baja (“There are 260 rivers that cross international boundaries, and this is the first such event in the history of the earth”) to the U.S. deputy secretary of the interior (“In retrospect, it seems so obvious that neighbors should take care of one another”)—had taken 15 years of lobbying to bring to fruition.

I'd planned on misery. I'd thought: The water won't be that deep. I'd thought: The water will be gross. I was wrong on all counts. We ripped downstream on a bona fide river. It was eight feet deep and a hundred feet wide.

On March 23, I’d stood with a crowd of 200 on the bank below Morelos Dam, gazing at the concrete monolith and waiting for the first gate to open. Beside me, Jennifer Pitt, the director of the Environmental Defense Fund’s Colorado River Project, and Peter Culp, a Phoenix attorney and the go-to lawyer for Colorado River water issues, held their breath. “We’ve been waiting a long time for this,” Pitt said. It was way back in 1998 when Pitt, who was already at EDF, and Culp, then a law student volunteering for the Sonoran Institute, first came up with a plan for how new water-sharing agreements could free up some flow for the delta.

For years the idea went nowhere. Mexico and the U.S. were battling over Mexico’s water supply, and by 2006 litigation was the preferred mode of communication. It took an earthquake to shake everyone into action. On Easter Sunday 2010, a 7.2-magnitude temblor destroyed much of Mexico’s canal system. The U.S. agreed to store some of Mexico’s water in Lake Mead on an emergency basis until Mexico could use it, and relations began to thaw. In November 2012, Minute 319, the latest amendment to the 1944 Water Treaty between the two countries, was signed. It allows Mexico, which has no large reservoirs of its own, to store future surplus water in Lake Mead in exchange for agreeing to share the burden of any future shortages. The U.S. agreed to invest in improvements to Mexico’s irrigation network, and part of the water saved from that was devoted to delta restoration. Mexico’s National Farmers Confederation objected to what it saw as a water grab by the U.S., and California’s Imperial Irrigation District and Los Angeles squabbled over each other’s role in the agreement, but their voices were drowned out by the deal’s environmental component, which made it a crowd-pleaser in both countries. As Pitt put it, “How could you not fix this problem? It’s so obvious. And it gets people on an emotional level. It’s just not right. Especially at the bottom of something as grand as the Colorado River.”

And with that, Gate 11 creaked open, a frothing mass of whitewater spilled out of the dam, and everybody went wild. Jennifer and Peter raised their fists in the air. Cameras clicked. Two drones whirred overhead. A sheet of water rushed over the marsh, simmering with escaping air bubbles, and licked our feet. Champagne corks popped. Jennifer doused Osvel. Osvel doused Francisco Zamora, director of the Sonoran Institute, who cried, “¡Hay agua!” And we all watched as a tendril nosed its way down the channel, hesitated in a pool, seemingly uncertain, then appeared to make up its mind as it spilled over the lip and ran downstream. If the water could make it 50 miles, it would reach the Laguna Grande restoration site, where tens of thousands of seedlings had been planted by Pronatura and the Sonoran Institute.

That was so easy, I said to Peter Culp. Just open the gates and let the water flow. Should happen every year. But Culp wondered if it would ever happen again. As part of Minute 319, EDF, the Sonoran Institute, and Pronatura had agreed to provide a 52,000-acre-foot base flow, to be delivered over five years, to keep the new trees alive. They were scrambling to purchase water rights from Mexican farmers, and they’d teamed up with the Nature Conservancy, the Redford Center, and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation in a Raise the River campaign to find the $10 million needed to do it. Even Will Ferrell and Kelly Slater lent a hand, shooting a mock PSA with Robert Redford in which they proposed that instead of raising the river, we should move the ocean.

But in 2017, the agreement must be renegotiated, and there is no guarantee that it will include water for the environment at all. With the Southwest projected to add another 20 million people in the next two decades and climate-change models predicting a 10 percent decline in the Colorado’s flow, finding extra water is getting harder. Frankly, the fact that it happened here in 2014 felt like a minor miracle. Right up until the moment when the first dam gate opened, I’d half expected black helicopters to swoop in and claim this precious resource for the city-state of Los Angeles.

Knowledge that this flood might never be repeated made it seem even more dreamlike as we forked into a low-lying meander and found ourselves in a lush bayou that felt more like Mississippi than Mexico. Beavers slapped their tails at us. Bees nuzzled willow flowers. Seeds rained down by the billions. Osvel cocked his ear and reeled off bird names. A flock of white-faced ibis wheeled overhead. Beads of light caught where the water surface bulged around cattail stems.

“This looks suspiciously like a green lagoon,” I said.

“I can’t believe how normal it feels,” said Pete, a look of awe on his face. “The ecological memory is so deep.” When Pete tried this journey in 2008, he’d run out of water to travel on and wound up hiking 90 miles through salt pan to reach the sea. “It was hell,” he said. “A total slog. Worst trip I’ve ever done.”

“I can’t believe how safe it feels,” Sam said. Just a few years earlier, every crime known to man took place amid the tamarisks of the limitrophe.

“We used to see miscreants every day when we were doing fieldwork,” Osvel said. “One time we were doing a bird survey, and we always carry a machete, and we came to a clearing and there were people pointing guns at us and shouting, ‘Drop the machete!’ ” They turned out to be police, which made him feel only slightly better. “They were very nervous, and seeing nervous people point guns at you is not fun.”

“This is gonna close my boating résumé on the Colorado,” Fred mused. “I’ve done it all except for this stretch. The culmination of the past ten years.” Fred has floppy hair, fluid eyes, and a mischievous smile that hints of the rebellious teenager he was 25 years ago (twice thrown in the clink). Once, during a Native American ceremony, he’d been taken by intense visions in which he saw himself flying through a lush corridor of cottonwoods and willows as light emanated from his chest. It informed his career. “I try to keep myself open to the spiritual aspect of this work, instead of making it all about salinity and hydrology,” he said.

I think of Fred as a restoration shaman. Straight out of college, he spent six years living with the Mojave and Navajo Indians along the lower Colorado in Arizona and reviving hundreds of acres of wetlands. I’ve walked and paddled through chirping, trilling marshes that began as visions in Fred’s head. While other restoration projects resemble tree farms, Fred’s are like epic Japanese gardens, waving banks of willows and wildflowers shot through with water and paths. Although he isn’t involved with any of the Minute 319 restoration projects, his sites are where the NGOs take potential donors and government officials to inspire them. As Osvel put it to me, “Fred is always one step ahead.”

By late afternoon, we’d already covered 20 river miles, and the cottonwoods disappeared. Billions of tiny copepods, having lain dormant as eggs for a decade or more, had hatched and were feasting on algae along the water’s fringe. High, sandy banks—perhaps 100,000 years’ worth of powdered canyon—bracketed the flow. Beyond them, a khaki nothingness. The occasional image of a drowned cactus rippled up at us like something out of a Dalí painting. We saw no one.

No one, that is, until we rounded a bend at dusk and heard the throb of ranchero music. The sleepy city of San Luis Río Colorado had awakened. The water had arrived the day before; the party was ongoing. Kids splashed and giggled in the shallows. Dozens of trucks lined the banks, speakers blasting. An ice cream truck and a coconut seller were doing brisk business on the beach beneath the bridge. An optimist with a net waded chest-deep through the water, sweeping it around him. The French filmmakers, who were working on a two-hour documentary for their People of the River series, were waiting for us.

As we paddled into town, five caballeros on horseback galloped through the water beside us, kicking spray behind them. They were experts in charreria, Mexican horse dancing, and they put on an impromptu show for the cheering crowd. Dogs barked. Children screamed. One horse sent the French cameraman sprawling to the ground. An old man with a cane wobbled on the water’s edge, snapping shots with his smartphone.

Sam was sitting cross-legged on his paddleboard, smiling. “I think I underestimated the social impact,” he said. “This is aligning more than just river channels.”

The optimist strode grinning out of the water holding a string of carp the length of his arm. I paddled past one of the guys who used to jump off the bridge. “Happy to have the river back?” I asked.

“Of course, amigo,” he shouted back to me. “It’s our name!”

We camped in a mesquite grove previously restored by Pronatura, where Osvel’s Pronatura compadres were waiting for us with tamales, tequila, Tecate, and a mountain of carne asada so vast that it stretched all the way into breakfast. To the binational agreement we contributed three guitars and a mandolin. Juan Butron, a leathery local guy who’d been working with Pronatura and would be helping us navigate the delta’s twists and turns tomorrow, joined us in time to deliver a rousing rendition of “La Bamba” to the stars, with light coyote accompaniment.

Around the campfire, we discussed what it would take to get San Luis its river permanently. “I wish social memory was longer than it is,” Sam said, strumming absently. “Are people still going to be inspired in three years when there’s not much to show from this?” With Sam’s backing, Fred’s consulting firm had developed a concept design for the delta restoration projects that used high-tech gates and levees to capture much more of the water than the dirt channels dug in the current sites, but it had not been implemented. “There will be a lot of excuses not to go further,” he said. “But the opportunity is huge. It’ll be something to watch.”

Yes it will. Here’s the short version: In ten to twenty years, unless the drought breaks in a big way or everybody in Los Angeles starts recycling their own pee, Lake Mead will run dry, and the Southwest will have to pack up its playthings and move in with its relatives back east.

Here’s the longer version: Each year, according to the Law of the River, the century-old pillar of legal documents governing the allocation of the Colorado, Lake Mead must distribute 1.5 million acre-feet (MAF) of water to Mexico, 4.4 to California, 2.8 to Arizona, and 0.3 to Nevada. It loses another 0.6 MAF to evaporation. But the reservoir receives 1.2 MAF—four Las Vegases—less than it distributes. Currently, Mead has just 12 MAF left.

Really, really bad math? Well, yes, but the original math was done during a particularly wet period in the early 20th century, when there seemed to be more than enough water to go around for the sparsely populated Southwest. Even as the Sunbelt boomed in the 1980s and 1990s, Mead’s managers avoided paying the piper, thanks to a series of wet El Niño years.

The piper came calling in 2000, when the worst drought in 1,200 years settled onto the Southwest. Worse, research into the deep archeological record revealed that the wet decades of the 20th century were the anomaly and the dry years of the 21st were closer to the norm. Since 2001, Mead has been dropping 13 to 14 feet each year. It is now below 1,100 feet, with a 120-foot-high white bathtub ring to show just how far it has fallen.

When Mead hits 1,075 feet, which should be in either 2016 or 2017, automatic rationing begins. Farmers in Arizona will begin to be cut off. At 1,050 feet, which looms for 2020, Vegas loses its current water intake, Arizona’s farmers go under, and Hoover Dam stops being able to generate hydroelectric power. “All of those agricultural districts receive federally subsidized power,” Peter Culp had pointed out to me as we’d watched water pour out of Morelos Dam. “Suddenly, you have the ag districts trying to buy power on the market at five times the price.” When the reservoir drops to 1,000 feet, somewhere around 2025, Phoenix is toast, Vegas loses its new intake, and farming becomes impossible in great swaths of the Southwest. “In the meantime,” according to Culp, “you’ve got a bunch of banks and bond markets saying, You know, that Vegas-Phoenix real estate market doesn’t look like such a great investment. The last time they concluded that, it tanked the world economy.” Which is why Culp suspects emergency measures would kick in before then. “There’s no way you can let Mead hit 1,000. It would be so horribly stupid.”

Slowing Mead’s downfall would require suspending the Law of the River, which dictates that Southern California will remain unscathed as its neighbors collapse—something Culp finds unlikely. “It’s not credible that Arizona and Vegas would be entirely cut off before California is affected. Can you imagine the feds standing by and allowing that to happen?” Instead, picture a wildly unpopular federal water czar declaring a state of emergency and parceling out Southern California’s water to keep Phoenix and Vegas on an IV drip. Picture the mother of all lawsuits creeping across the Mojave dunes.

That’s the doomsday scenario. And who doesn’t love the clarifying tonic of impending doom? Y2K. Peak oil. Now the coming megadrought. Dry riverbeds and white bathtub rings seize headlines. Sam wishes there was less focus on scare stories and more on smart water solutions—ways to shepherd the West through its day of reckoning to a green future of thriving cities, hyperefficient agriculture, and a Colorado delta teeming with life. It turns out that, even at the lower-flow levels projected for the Colorado, we have enough water to do all those things, if—and this is a big if, an if as vast as a Sonoran Desert horizon—we get smart. Really smart. Children of Dune smart.

For example, while Phoenix uses 165 gallons of water per person per day, Tucson uses just 128. One difference? Phoenix still favors a lush-lawn look, whereas Tucson embraced its desert identity decades ago. Lawns out, cactuses in. All new homes are required to have gray-water systems that reuse water for irrigation. The city offers rebates for low-flush toilets and rain collectors. And 10 percent of the city’s water is reclaimed from the sewer system, treated, and used for irrigation.

That still can’t touch Vegas, where every drop of water that goes down a drain or toilet is treated and pumped back into Lake Mead. (Vegas really does drink its own pee.) The only water lost is what’s used for irrigation, and even that has plunged since the city banned new front lawns and began paying people to replace existing ones with desert vegetation. Water use in Vegas has dropped by a third. Los Angeles is also now paying people $2 per square foot to remove their lawns.

Every city in the Southwest will need to get aboard the Vegas bandwagon. And they can. Australia already has. Cities there, which have been dealing with crippling aridity longer than we have, use just over half the water per person of their American counterparts. If Southern California alone were to adopt Australian rules concerning outdoor watering and low-flow fixtures, it would save 1.3 MAF of water per year—more than Lake Mead’s deficit.

Agriculture can save even more—though the real gains must come through you, carnivore. At least 70 percent of the water in the Colorado River basin gets used for agriculture, and most of that is used to grow livestock feed like alfalfa. This means that about five million acre-feet of the river—a third of its entire flow—gets turned into milk or hamburgers, and hamburgers are a particularly stupid thing to make out of the Colorado. Each hamburger takes about 500 gallons of water. If we each eat one fewer hamburger per year, we’ve just freed up a generous annual pulse flow for the river.

Not that the river would get it. Current “use it or lose it” water laws don’t allow farmers to sell any surplus allotment, so they end up growing as much alfalfa as they can and selling it on the global market. Peter Culp estimates that 50 billion gallons of water—1.5 pulse flows—is shipped to China each year in the form of alfalfa, and even more to Japan. An open water market would allow both cities and environmental groups to pay farmers far more than they currently make growing alfalfa. Conservation groups are working to establish one, but the effort will face years of political wrangling.

We don’t have years, so let’s get on it. Toilet to tap. Grass to cash. Beef to beans. A new generation of falafel-munching cowboys checking the drip irrigators on their olive farms. And spending their off-season floating the mighty Colorado delta.

Day two at dawn, Fred smudged us all with sage smoke and a turkey feather. “A little love for the delta,” he said, blowing smoke in my face. When I gave him the raised eyebrow, he smiled and said, “It just helps you to shed whatever you need to shed. For a long time I felt a little odd about it, like what right do I have to be doing these things? But the Navajo elder who taught me said, ‘A lot of my tribe isn’t doing it, so somebody needs to.’ ”

By the time we launched, it felt like we were on a vision quest of our own, traveling the Colorado’s possible futures. There were no more green lagoons. The water got browner, sandier, shallower. In places the surface was dotted with clouds of frothy brown scum. “The Mojaves call this turtle shit,” Fred said. “It used to cover the river before the dams.”

Juan spotted a mysterious backpack trapped in an eddy. He paddled over to it, reached out, then changed his mind. “Mala vibra,” he said. Bad vibe. An old-school Sonoran in his sixties, Juan canoed in his standard uniform of tight denim shirt, tight denim jeans, and dusty red cowboy boots. He eyed the paddleboards with great skepticism. “Want to try?” Sam asked. No, sir.

We saw bizarre things. Around one bend, the river was boiling furiously, like a giant vat of pasta water, as air bubbled out of the sandy bed. “There’s something I’ve never seen before,” said Fred.

“I have,” said Sam. “In flash floods.” As the water sank deep into the sand, as he had predicted, it was forcing long-buried air to the surface. He stared darkly into the bubbling cauldron. “This dry aquifer is the wild card. I’m very curious to see how the groundwater responds.” We all listened to the ominous gurgling, the sound of the river choking on sand. “I hope this river makes the sea,” Sam said, “even though it would prove me wrong.”

Sam offered Juan the paddleboard again. Juan shrugged. “Come on, try it.” OK. Juan pulled off his cowboy boots, mounted the paddleboard, and puttered downstream in tight denim shirt, tight denim jeans, and bare feet. A strange look crossed his face as he shifted his weight and gazed down at the water around him. He began singing to himself. “Esta agradable,” he murmured softly.

In late afternoon, I asked Juan if he wanted back in the canoe. He shook me off.

We knew we were running out of river when the channel flattened and we found ourselves paddling in a foot of brown, tamarisk-clogged water. Osvel and I were in a canoe up front, and as we cleared a stand of tamarisk we saw a ten-foot-high wall of sand stretching across the channel—a road crossing installed by some farmer who never expected the river to be wet again. I looked up at the wall and thought, This is how it ends.

Was the grand experiment worth it? Do we let the river go back to its slumber? Or do we raise it again? Having seen it wet and dry, having watched the dam open and close, I understand more than ever that it is simply a choice we get to make.

But then we saw two figures standing on the berm. It was Peter Culp and Jennifer Pitt, who’d been chasing the leading lobe of the river for days by jeep through farmers’ barren fields. After spotting the dam from the air, the NGOs had sweet-talked a local excavator into digging an emergency trough through the berm. It was still too high for the water, but not by much. Osvel and I canoed through the last few inches, pushing our paddles against the sandy bottom, until our bow ground to a stop. We’d run the river dry.

The others arrived behind us. “Keep it going!” they shouted. We attacked the trough with our paddles, shoveling it down to the water’s level. Peter and Jennifer joined in. For 15 years they had written reports, filed briefings, raised funds, and bended ears to get the water this far. Now they were digging with their bare hands to get it a few feet farther.

At 6:24 p.m., as the shadows of tamarisks lengthened across the red-tinged sands, the first trickle escaped the trough and dropped into the empty channel on the far side. We cheered. Soon the water was building on itself, picking up speed, scouring the sandy walls of the road. Through the night it rose, and we rode the mini-rapids on our paddleboards again and again, occasionally knocked sideways by a calving chunk of road. Pronatura had brought Fred’s truck down from Morelos to haul our gear back, and we spent the night by the river, sleeping in the sand.

We had come 32 miles. That meant there were another 68 or so to reach the sea, some of them very dry. The water would make just a few more miles the next day, and the day after that, creeping on through the saline lands. A week later, it would fill the backwaters of Laguna Grande, where 100,000 trees are now sprouting, and it would touch places—and people—that never thought they’d see water again.

Having no more river to travel, we returned to our lives. Fred to Arizona, Sam and Pete to Colorado, me to Vermont. Osvel and Juan to Pronatura’s bird counts and flow monitoring. Sam gave Juan his paddleboard, scrawling “Por Juan del Rio” on the yellow deck.

A few days later, they began reducing the flow out of Morelos, and the river slowed even more. So I was surprised when I received a note from Pete. He and Sam had returned to the delta. “I have to make the sea,” Pete wrote. “Kind of reaching mission stage at this point.” With Juan divining the way on his Badfish, they took it in 20-mile chunks, waiting for the water to fill each reach. It wasn’t pretty. “Complete warfare,” Pete wrote. “Chopping, pleading the boards through dead and living cattail and mesquite jungles. It will go down as the most beautiful and one of the hardest paddles in this kid’s book.” They battled mosquitoes and 107-degree temperatures; they floated over swimming coral snakes and under endangered clapper rails. Toward the end, they had to paddle commando on their bellies in the dark to hide from malditos—narco bandits who work the empty lower delta—but on May 5, they hit the high-tide line of the gulf and kissed salt water.

Thus the séance ended. On May 21, the gates of Morelos Dam groaned closed, and the last of the water snaked into the dust. San Luis Río Colorado went back to being the city on the sandbox.

Was the grand experiment worth it? To Sam, that depends on what happens next. “One pulse does not a living system make, but it does remind us that it is alive,” he wrote. Knowing that, do we let the river go back to its slumber, or do we raise it again? Annually? Permanently? Having seen the limitrophe wet and dry, having watched the dam open and close, I now understand more than ever that, at some level, it is simply a choice we get to make, and I have to believe that for anyone, Mexican or American, who got a taste of the delta in the spring of 2014, it’s an easy call. We’d found the bucking, ecstatic Colorado of old, right where we’d left it, romping through its old playgrounds like an oversize kid. For a few electric miles, it was in its element, and so were we. It tumbled into a hundred green lagoons, traveling them all, and so did we. It divided and rejoined, twisted and turned, meandered in awesome jungles, got lost and was glad of it, and so were we. It turned down long-forgotten paths, trying to find a graceful way forward, and so did we.","Tue, 10 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.outsideonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/full-page/public/migrated-images_parent/migrated-images_68/co-river-main_h.jpg?itok=0DJkikan,"['free', 'set', 'dry', 'delta', 'restoration', 'dam', 'colorado', 'day', 'feet', 'water', 'sam', 'river', 'osvel']",

The summer before 9th grade, Celia Islam went back to visit her grandparents in Bangladesh, like she always did. Except that this time, the town she was visiting, Sirajgang, had just been ravaged by an awful flood: houses were destroyed, schools were demolished, and children were displaced.

“It looked completely different,” Islam said.

Islam, now a graduating senior at George C. Marshall High School, decided to raise money for the families who had been affected by the flood. She said that it started out just as a bake sale with her friends, which raised a couple hundred dollars. But after the bake sale was over, Islam was still not satisfied. “I just felt like there was more to be done…a couple hundred dollars was not enough to rebuild someone’s life,” she said.

That’s when Islam created the Children’s Trust Fund, a nonprofit organization led by students in 15 high schools across the country. The Fund, which incorporated as a 501c(3) in 2011, raises money to help empower families in Bangladesh with rickshaws and farm animals. These items are crucial to helping families become self-sustaining, said Islam, and thus help children who are malnourished and suffering from chronic diseases.

Islam was one of 42 students that received the McDonald’s Educates Scholarship this year to go towards her college education at George Washington University starting next year. Islam said that she plans to join the seven year BA/MD program there, which will allow her to be a pediatric nurse.

“It has a lot to do with CT Fund,” Islam said. “One of the main issues…[for the children in Bangladesh] is getting proper health care,” she said.

34,34,FL-2014-000080-CHN,Storm causes deluge of insurance claims - Stuff.co.nz,https://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/10151644/Storm-causes-deluge-of-insurance-claims,"BURSTING AT THE SEAMS: The Waihou River in Te Aroha was the highest it has been in years.

Insurance companies are expecting more claims to roll in as a result of the wild weather that has lashed the region.

AA Insurance head of customer relations, Suzanne Wolton, said it was too early to estimate the cost of damage, but call volumes had increased ""six-fold"" as a result of the storm's destruction.

""The most common types of storm damage have been to roofs, windows, and fences. We've had trees falling through windows or onto fences and roofs. There has been flooding throughout homes, and tiles lifted or completely gone, leaving holes that have allowed water damage to ceilings.""

The company had received 300 claims from the Waikato and Auckland regions yesterday.

Although the weather system is expected to move south today, its effects are still being felt.

Waikato Regional Council's flood response team will continue to monitor river levels.

Te Waihou River, near Te Aroha, swelled to levels that had not been seen in years, causing a flood risk for some Te Aroha properties in the southern end of Rewi St, Honi St, Herries St, and the southern end of Whitaker St.

Elsewhere in the region, tributaries feeding the lower Waikato River are also particularly swollen.

The heavy rain also proved potentially hazardous, with wastewater from the Hamilton's wastewater plant in Pukete overflowing into the Waikato River for one hour yesterday morning.

The Waikato Regional Council said ""heavily diluted"" wastewater overflowed intermittently into the river. The easing of the heavy rain meant there should be less pressure on the plant. Extra monitoring and testing would continue.

Residents living in Matatoki, south of Thames, were also having infrastructure issues because of the rain.

The filters treating the raw water supply to the reservoir were blocked as a result of heavy rain and silt in the Matatoki stream.

The Thames Coromandel District Council provided a tanker of potable water in Matatoki for residential use.

MetService scaled down its heavy-rain warning covering eastern Waikato and the Coromandel Peninsula yesterday afternoon.

The weather is expected to settle down heading into the weekend.

The Waikato Civil Defence Emergency Management Group urged Coromandel Peninsula residents to take extra care on the roads.

Waikato Police were also busy dealing with surface flooding and crashes on the slippery roads.

Waikato roads were busy as motorists made their way to Fieldays and police were urging drivers to careful.

District road policing manager inspector Freda Grace said the call came after several close calls in Mystery Creek Rd where people had driven to the event, braving the wild weather, then walked from the car parking areas in dark clothing. Some pedestrians narrowly missed being hit, she said.

Police recommended people enter Fieldays wearing hi-visibility clothing, and that drivers allowed plenty of room to react to any mistake either on their part or by other road users.

Grace said people heading to and from the Fieldays needed to ensure they drove to the conditions and, if it was raining or traffic flows were heavy, they should slow down.

MetService predicted between 120 millimetres and 180mm of rain would have fallen from Wednesday night to this morning.

The new rain band comes as waterways and soils are already saturated from heavy rain on the Coromandel over the past few days. One household in Te Aroha was evacuated yesterday as a result of flood risk.

The Thames Coromandel council said people in the Rewi St home went to stay with friends, while Matamata Piako District Council staff continued to monitor nearby properties.

State Highway 29 over the Kaimai Range was closed in both directions yesterday afternoon, because of a major slip, but it was expected to reopen later yesterday evening.

The weather is expected to settle heading into the weekend. ""Over the last few days the South Island has seen some drier and brighter weather creeping northwards and, for the weekend that's moving on to the North Island,"" said MetService meteorologist John Law yesterday. florence.kerr@fairfaxmedia.co.nz","Fri, 13 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://static2.stuff.co.nz/1402606601/074/10153074.jpg,"['insurance', 'river', 'causes', 'rain', 'heavy', 'result', 'waikato', 'weather', 'deluge', 'st', 'coromandel', 'yesterday', 'te', 'claims', 'storm']",

The news came as officials insist that the children are in good hands, despite allegations of abuse by US authorities.

Senior administration officials, who asked not to be identified, told reporters that an Army base at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, will initially hold 600 ‘unaccompanied minors’ and eventually will be able to accommodate up to 1,200.

In recent weeks, the Obama administration has opened similar emergency shelters at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, and Naval Base Ventura County in Southern California.

The moves come amid a tidal wave of children trying to slip into the United States, largely from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, often to join a parent already here.

Reuters previously reported that the administration was seeking about $2billion for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to handle the influx in fiscal 2015, which begins on October 1, more than double the $868million appropriated this year.

HHS takes custody of the children shortly after they are detained at the border by federal law enforcement agents.

One week ago, the White House director of domestic policy, Cecilia Munoz, attributed the rapid run-up in illegal immigration by unaccompanied minors to growing violence - often drug related or due to domestic abuse - in the three Central American countries.

However, there are also concerns about the children being abused on American soil.

Documents obtained by BuzzFeed show that a large number of minors have lodged complaints that they've suffered abuse at the hands of US immigration officials.

The allegations include officials kicking, punching and verbally abusing minors.

There were 809 abuse complaints filed against the Border Patrol between 2009 and 2012, according to the American Immigration Council.

Many children crossing the border to America end up being held in Arizona and a top official there says that they are well looked after.

Chaos as Islamic militants scatter Iraqi security forces

Government planes target ISIS with airstrikes

As a tide of Sunni militant fighters sweeping toward Baghdad threatens the government of Shiite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a flood of refugees sought safety in the autonomous region of Kurdistan.

At one checkpoint in northern Iraq, CNN's Arwa Damon witnessed a bumper-to-bumper procession of cars and trucks fleeing from Mosul and surrounding villages.

A virtual parking lot of vehicles filled with woman and young children, the two-lane road was choked with dust and engine exhaust as Iraqi civilians fled the rapid advance of the militant Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, an al Qaeda splinter group also known by its acronym ISIS.

""Mosul has fallen to the terrorists,"" one young man told CNN. ""It's fallen to al Qaeda.""

That unraveling began in earnest on Tuesday as Iraqi security forces fled and militants overran Iraq's second-largest city in a stunning collapse that heightened questions about al-Maliki's ability to control not only Mosul, but the entire country.

Militants seized Mosul's airport, TV stations, the governor's office and other parts of the northern Iraqi city. There also were incursions into the oil refining town of Baiji.

Fighting alongside ISIS militants are other Sunni insurgent groups active during the U.S. invasion of Iraq that believe in fighting the Shia dominated government and its perceived anti-Sunni agenda, though they don't subscribe to ISIS's ideology or the establishment of an Islamic caliphate.

But this is much more than a battle between an insurgency and a government.

Much of the lands that have fallen to ISIS and its current allies is predominantly Sunni, where much of the population despises al-Maliki and his Shia-dominated government's polarizing policies.

It's a battle of survival between Sunni and Shia contingents.

Additionally, Shia religious leaders and others have called for volunteers to join Iraqi security forces in the fight.

Numerous reports of police and soldiers running from their posts in Mosul -- leaving uniforms, vehicles, weapons and ammunition behind -- raised the prospect that the Iraqi government did not either have the will or resources to combat the advancing threat.

""They have melted down, unfortunately,"" Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said of a video purporting to show hundreds of Iraqi forces captured by militants in Tikrit, hometown of former dictator Saddam Hussein. ""I mean, two army divisions in the city and their commanders escaped to the north. The government needs to take serious action.""

On Friday, President Barack Obama said the United States ""will not be sending U.S. troops back into combat in Iraq,"" but that he would be reviewing a range of other options in coming days.

Pressure for the United States to provide military support to Iraq's struggling government has increased, with conservative Republicans blaming Obama for the crisis by pulling out U.S. troops in 2011 to create a security vacuum.

The conflict could potentially escalate with reports that Iranian special forces were in Iraq to bolster the government of al-Maliki, a fellow Shiite. Iran rejected that claim.

At the northern Iraqi border crossing, families waiting in traffic described relative calm streets on streets where militant gunman roamed. Running water and gasoline were available, they said, but their biggest concern was airstrikes by the Iraqi military.

One such airstrike came against a former Iraqi military base south of Mosul where ISIS militants were believed to the staying. There also were warnings from Baghdad for residents to stay away from government buildings.

On Friday, Iraqi State TV reported that military airstrikes had killed 70 ISIS militants and wounded 40 others in Tikrit.

At the border crossing between Mosul and Iraqi Kurdistan, some returning refugees explained their willingness to come back by noting that ISIS had not conducted mass executions or pillaged towns.

A few hours later, however, ISIS published ""rules"" for residents based on a strict interpretation of Sharia law. A spokesman for the U.N.'s High Commissioner for Human Rights reported summary executions of Iraqi security forces and of 17 civilians thought to be working for the police in Mosul.","Fri, 13 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg,"['forces', 'iraq', 'mosul', 'iraqi', 'militants', 'choking', 'wanton', 'airstrikes', 'security', 'sunni', 'fear', 'watch', 'kurdistan', 'watched', 'iraqis', 'violence', 'isis', 'roads']",

(Alyssa Bereznak/Yahoo Tech)

NEW YORK — Did you hear about the latest iPhone app out of Harvard? It really stinks.

Harvard scientists successfully transferred the first scent from Paris to New York on Tuesday morning via an iPhone app. The champagne and passion fruit macaroon-scented message was transferred via a new communication platform called the oPhone.

It works like this: A custom-made app allows you to take a photo of something and “tag” it with a few aroma notes (from more than 3,000 scents). These smells — which range in category from “Paris Afternoon” to “Plantation” — are transferred via a pipe-like smelling station called an oPhone Duo and are controlled by an iPhone app called oSnap.

When you send an oNote, your recipient will click a link that leads him to a photo, as well as the specific aromatic notes you have chosen. When connected to the oPhone Duo, the hardware piece, it’ll emit slight scents from two separate pipes to be smelled in conjunction with the message. Otherwise, the app will just offer some vivid description of the scent your sender is trying to convey.

You don’t have to own the oPhone hardware, which starts at $149 on the company’s Indiegogo page, to send or receive a smell. Anyone without the contraption will still be able to tag images using the oSnap app (out in the App Store now) and mark it with around 16 different high and low notes. Currently, user creations range from “Lady Gaga” to “My Room” to “Smoky Beach.”

The device’s co-inventor, Harvard Professor David Edwards, hopes to spread this new technology to the hands of consumers over the next year via “hotspots.” The American Museum of Natural History, where the initial demonstration took place, will host the first oPhone hotspot in the United States for three consecutive weekends starting July 12. Other hotspots will be located in Paris cafes and in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Anyone who has made an oSnap via the app will be able to access it and smell its aroma in real life, using a Duo device at any of these special locations.

Edwards first began developing the idea for the his communication system in collaboration with a 23-year-old student, Rachel Field. The two hope to see it used in foodie cultures—to be paired with the images of meals that many already send to their friends, or share on social media sites like Instagram or Facebook.

“Say I’m a barista and I have these great coffees, and I have difficulty describing them,” Edwards said at the demonstration. “You come to the cafe, you’ve got the iPad, ask, ‘What kind of coffee is that?’ and you can play it, get the primary and secondary and the mixed notes. It’s an education; it helps you talk to the barista. From the retail point of view, it’s a real way of reaching out and saying, ‘Get some coffee.’ ”

Edwards documented the aromas of the above spread of food, using the oSnap app. (Alyssa Bereznak/Yahoo Tech)

The guts of the oPhone Duo consist of several small circular plastic pieces, what Edwards calls the “neurons” of the contraption. Inside each neuron are four air holes, three of which are packed with dry, aromatic material. When the oSnap app sends a signal to the oPhone, indicating which aromas to conjure, the machine spins the circular neurons so their holes align with an air current. The smell is then pulled up.

A pack of four neurons will sell for $20. Like an ink cartridge, these pieces supply a vast number of smells depending on what combinations you ask for.

Edwards admits that, “like playing the piano,” learning to identify aromatic notes is a process that takes time. “Once you get used to it, you get better at it,” he said at the event. “We’re really intrigued to see how people are using this.”

The oPhone isn’t the first gadget to enable an iPhone owner to experience smells. My colleague David Pogue reviewed a dongle from Pop Secret that attached to the iPhone and could puff out the scent of freshly popped popcorn. Oscar Mayer released a similar contraption that simulated the smell of bacon frying in the pan.

The oPhone can produce more sophisticated scents, though it’s not nearly as mobile as those gimmicky dongles. And that’s where the Harvard team’s other invention in the pipeline comes in: the oPhone Uno, a contraption that would theoretically allow you to dock your mobile phone to constantly receive smells.

“Ultimately if there’s enough interest here, you want this to be with you in your pocket everywhere.”

39,39,FL-2014-000080-CHN,Hero West Midlands firefighters rescue dozens from floods in Bosnia - expressandstar.com,https://www.expressandstar.com/editors-picks/2014/06/15/hero-west-midlands-firefighters-rescue-dozens-from-floods-in-bosnia/,"Forty eight hours later Watch Commander Russ Gauden and the rest of the 33-strong squad that included two more West Midland firemen had rescued 42 people and led 52 others to safety from floods that killed at least 34 people more than 1,500 miles away in Bosnia.

Among those saved from the 12 feet deep water were 18 women aged over 70 who could not swim. Several had broken limbs while others were suffering chest pains. Some were in difficulty in the water.

A lone child was rescued from a flooded building and handed over to their family. Three more children and their mother were carried to safety from a single storey building.

Four needed medical treatment from the crew who scoured a 10 mile stretch of flooded land. They also saved at least one pig and several dogs.

Tragedy struck in Bosnia after three months of torrential rain fell in a matter of days last month triggering 3,000 landslides, destroying villages and leaving tens of thousands of people homeless.

The Search and Rescue squad, made up entirely of firefighters from 15 forces in England, Scotland and Wales, was the first international team to arrive in Bosnia and were immediately rushed with four inflatable boats and other equipment to the north east of the country which had suffered worst in the disaster.

One of their many skills is quickly replacing communications destroyed in disasters, arriving at disaster scenes armed with a satellite computer system, sat phones and other gadgets needed to build their own network.

The squad flew from Manchester to Sarajevo in a specially chartered plane and were taken by military convoy to their destination that had been identified by local emergency planners.The team set up a base in an old school gym in the town of Bijeljina where they arrived exactly 24 hours after receiving the call for help. The first rescue was carried out in the pitch dark shortly afterwards.

Crew Commander Shammi Rana, 44, father of two year old twins old father of twins from Cannock who is based with the West Midland Fire Service Technical Rescue Unit at Wednesbury said: ""There is no doubt that people would have died without our help. We saved a lot of lives. You make the odd rescue when working as a fire fighter in this country but it fills you with pride to make that number of rescues within that sort of time frame.""

Mr Rana, who has also dealt with the aftermath of earthquakes in Haiti and Indonesia as well as the Japanese tsunami, explained: ""A mile from our temporary base the road was engulfed by water that stretched as far as the eye could see across hundreds of miles after two rivers burst their banks. We deployed the boats and headed for nearby villages where people were hanging on roofs and out of windows.

""We ferried them back to the road where the locals carried them away on tractors and other vehicles and then set off to rescue more survivors. Some of the farmers thought their pigs and cattle were more valuable than they were and wanted the livestock rescued first while they continued to cling to the roof.""

Father of four Mr Gauden, aged 42, who lives in Brierley Hill, has been in the fire service for 20 years and since joining the rescue team in 2003 has been sent to help in the aftermath of an earthquake in Haiti and a tsunami in Japan.

He said: ""It is surreal to have such a profound change of circumstance when you move from home to a disaster zone in such a short space of time change of situation. It was desperate. Many, many people were struggling and in need of international help. Some were on the roof of their home while others had put themselves at risk by entering the water, even though they could not swim. We faced a few difficulties, including language barriers, heat and long hours but there is a huge sense of personal satisfaction when you come home knowing that you have done a good job.""

Watch Commander Jeff March, a 52-year-old father of two from Alvechurch, stationed at Billesley, who has been a member of the search and rescue team for the last seven of his 24 years service as a fire fighter and deployed to earthquakes in Haiti and New Zealand. He said: ""I got the call at 9pm and was in Bosnia with a full team and all the equipment at 4pm the next day. It is always distressing to see people whose lives have been destroyed but the speed with which we deployed meant that we could make a massive difference to a large number of lives.""

UK International Search and Rescue gives round the clock 24-hour-a-day all year cover on a rota system that ensures at least 36 specialists are available at any one time for overseas deployment. They are all volunteers and arrive in a disaster zone with enough supplies to be self sufficient for ten days in everything but fuel.

Following the rescue phase of the Bosnia operation, humanitarian efforts took priority. The team distributed water, food and medicines to those who were cut off but refusing to leave their homes. They also helped restore the supply from two power stations inundated in the flood, ensuring that homes and farms had electricity as the water receded. Then the team headed for home just a week after arriving.","Sun, 15 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.expressandstar.com/resizer/JaI8gHe-v3mOZnqJOggamD-x3D4=/1200x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/mna/3ZBOYV2A2JCNTBLEYDMHODOVPI.jpg,"['west', 'rescued', 'service', 'team', 'bosnia', 'firefighters', 'midlands', 'saved', 'floods', 'dozens', 'hero', 'water', 'help', 'squad', 'rescue', 'search']",

42,42,FL-2014-000080-CHN,"In Texas' Rio Grande Valley, a seemingly endless surge of immigrants - Los Angeles Times",https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-texas-border-chaos-20140614-story.html,"The call went out on Border Patrol radios just before sundown one day this week: 31 immigrants spotted illegally crossing the Rio Grande on a raft.

No sooner had the migrants been found hiding in the mesquite brush than another report came in: A woman and boy were walking up the riverbank.

The Rio Grande Valley has become ground zero for an unprecedented surge in families and unaccompanied children flooding across the Southwest border, creating what the Obama administration is calling a humanitarian crisis as border officials struggle to accommodate new detainees. Largely from Central America, they are now arriving at a rate of more than 35,000 a month.

Anzalduas Park, a 96-acre expanse of close-cropped fields and woodland that sits on the southern bend of the river, has turned from an idyllic family recreation area into a high-traffic zone for illegal migration.

The number of children and teenagers traveling alone from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador is expected to reach up to 90,000 across the Southwest border by the end of the year, along with a surge of families with children seeking safe passage into the U.S.

“This is the hottest spot in the nation for crossings,” said Hidalgo County Precinct 3 Constable Lazaro “Larry” Gallardo, a valley native who said he had never seen a migration wave of such a scale during his 14 years in office. “Something’s got to be done because the numbers are just too high.”

Detentions along this stretch of the river have gone from up to 50 immigrants a week to as many as 300. On Tuesday night, constables captured 100, on Monday nearly 200. Authorities are comparing the onslaught of homeless detainees to the displacements brought by Hurricane Katrina.

“The basic difference is that the vast majority of those people were here legally, whereas the current group has come here illegally,” said Donald Reay, executive director of the Southwest Border Sheriff’s Coalition. “You end up with a double-edged sword. You want to deal with the humanitarian side but also have to deal with the rule-of-law side.”

Many of the migrants are young women with children who tell authorities they are fleeing unrest in their homelands. Not long ago, a Honduran woman barely made it across the river before giving birth among the park’s red and blue picnic tables and signs warning “Children at Play.”

Some migrants cross on weekends and try to blend in with picnicking crowds in the park. But many willingly give themselves up, driven by reports in Central America that immigrants who arrive with children are being allowed to stay in the U.S. indefinitely. (Officials believe smugglers use some families as decoys to divert authorities’ attention from other migrants crossing elsewhere.)

One woman walking up the park riverbank this week with a boy made no attempt to flee when Sgt. Dan Broyles, a Hidalgo County deputy constable, approached. She toted two purses, as if headed to the mall — a stark contrast to migrants of years past, who girded themselves with survival gear to endure harsh treks through the desert.

“Did you come on a raft?” Broyles, 51, asked in Spanish.

Yes, the woman said, after traveling by bus from Honduras.

“He’s your son?”

Yes, she said, 9 years old. The boy’s left arm was in a cast, the result of falling out of a tree before their trip. Around his neck he wore a black-and-white cross woven from plastic lanyards.

“Did you pay someone to cross?”

She said she paid $1,000 — 10 times the going rate before the recent influx.

Her son needs an eye operation she could not afford. She had heard that they would be allowed to stay in the U.S., at least long enough for her to find work and pay for the surgery.

“We can stay temporarily and get money, and if we have to go, we go,” she said with tears in her eyes before Border Patrol agents loaded them into a van headed for a station already overcrowded with migrants.

Moments later, a Guatemalan woman walked up to Broyles out of the darkness, with her 15-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter. The boy carried his sister, who wore a frilly green dress and patent leather shoes.

They had been hiding in the marsh, which was filled with tarantulas and lizards. Signs nearby warned of snakes.

Their 15-day journey, she said, had begun after her husband abandoned her, and his brother kicked them out of the family home. Now her jeans, studded with pink rhinestones, were covered in mud and she was crying with relief.

Border facilities in Texas and Arizona have quickly become overloaded. The McAllen Border Patrol station near here, which has space to detain 250 immigrants, instead houses 1,500 daily, according to Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera, vice president of the agents’ union’s local chapter. Other smaller stations in the valley are housing twice or three times their capacity, he said.

Emergency shelters have been opened at military bases in Texas, Oklahoma and California — and at another facility in Arizona — but immigrant advocates and border agents have described the initial intake facilities on the border as badly overcrowded and ill-equipped to handle the onslaught.

Mayeli Hernandez, a 12-year-old Honduran girl who made the trip with her 8-year-old sister, said the journey with smugglers wasn’t as difficult as her four days in detention in McAllen last July.

“We were there for four days without showering, without brushing our teeth,” Mayeli said. “The guards were always angry. They told me that I was asking for too much water to drink.”

In a complaint filed last week with the federal Department of Homeland Security, five immigrant rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union Border Litigation Project, alleged that children in custody between the ages of 5 and 17 faced physical and sexual abuse, overcrowding, freezing temperatures, inadequate water and spoiled food.

Their 25-page report documented accounts of sexual abuse, strip searches, a child who had to drink from a toilet tank, filthy restrooms and children forced to sleep on floors.

Border Patrol officials have said they will look into the allegations. Cabrera said agents are also concerned about unsanitary conditions, such as the practice of quarantining sick immigrants behind a piece of yellow tape, strung across the room, that does little to protect agents or fellow migrants.

Cleaning crews wipe the holding areas down regularly, but agents still fear contagious diseases, Cabrera said. “It’s not just the disease issues, but the sheer amount of filth that’s floating through the air.”

President Obama has directed federal agencies to address the widening crisis in the Rio Grande Valley, with new stopgap measures announced almost daily. Yet another temporary detention center is scheduled to open in McAllen, Texas, in a 55,000-square-foot warehouse, Cabrera said.

In Arizona, state officials have rushed provisions, such as vaccines and other medical supplies, to a federal holding facility in Nogales that is being used to hold children who were caught crossing unaccompanied into the Rio Grande Valley.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say they don’t have room to detain parents and children long-term.

Children detained by immigration authorities are supposed to be held a maximum of 72 hours, then moved to temporary shelters, where they spend about a month on average before being placed with relatives or sponsors while their immigration cases are pending.

But senior Obama administration officials who briefed reporters this week acknowledged that they haven’t been able to meet the 72-hour requirement: There is simply not enough staff to process all the new arrivals.

Once they are processed, the Border Patrol has been flying many families to other states and releasing them en masse at bus stations with notices to appear in immigration courts at their destinations.

At the McAllen Greyhound station this week, volunteers set up tables of donations, then moved to a nearby church hall that was soon overwhelmed by immigrant mothers.

Among them was Blanca Isabel Cruz, 36, who had brought her daughter Xenia, 13, across the river on a raft with smugglers after traveling north by bus from El Salvador. They planned to catch a bus to join relatives in Fredericksburg, Va. The family had migrated in stages: first her 15-year-old daughter with cousins; then her husband, a fisherman, with their 6-year-old daughter; then Cruz with Xenia.

Cruz, a petite woman in a ponytail and a pink T-shirt, said they came because gang violence had worsened in their coastal city of La Union as a 2-year-old truce disintegrated between the country’s two largest gangs and a new government failed to help.

“There are gangs and delinquents all over the place,” she said. “Here, it’s safe.”

And the flow continues.

At 11:26 p.m. Wednesday, nearly half an hour after Sgt. Broyles’ shift ended, a woman and three boys approached his truck out of the dark.

Belkin Rivera Hernandez, 24, said she’d heard television reports that single mothers would receive permission to stay in the U.S., and decided to try to cross with her son and two other boys from Honduras, hoping to meet her mother in Virginia.

“The situation in Honduras is only getting worse,” she said as Broyles handed her a chilled bottle of water, part of a supply deputies buy themselves for the migrants.

Border Patrol agents arrived and loaded the family into a van with half a dozen other women and children.

He was suave, but three years after the peaceful protests started, his record of relying on horrific brutality to maintain power is clear. Moreover, his regime has a history of implicit cooperation with Al Qaeda, as we saw in Iraq. This is not a man with whom the United States should align itself.

Mr. Assad now depends on Iran and Hezbollah for his survival, and Iran’s influence in Syria is likely to remain as long as Mr. Assad does. Hezbollah, though, is unlikely to fight to clear eastern Syria of jihadists. None of this serves American interests.

To be sure, there is no military solution, but it is possible to salvage something in Syria by preparing the conditions for a genuine negotiation toward a new government. And that requires empowering the moderate armed opposition.

First, the Free Syrian Army needs far greater material support and training so that it can mount an effective guerrilla war. Rather than try to hold positions in towns where the regime’s air force and artillery can flatten it, the armed opposition needs help figuring out tactics to choke off government convoy traffic and overrun fixed-point defenses.

To achieve this, the Free Syrian Army must have more military hardware, including mortars and rockets to pound airfields to impede regime air supply operations and, subject to reasonable safeguards, surface-to-air missiles. Giving the armed opposition these new capabilities would jolt the Assad military’s confidence.

Even Iran would have to consider the safety of its supply flights. That caution would inform Iranian thinking and might even stir Tehran to join us in pushing for serious negotiations.

Cash for small salaries, together with reliable supplies of food, medicine and ammunition, would also put the moderate armed forces on an equal footing with the Qaeda groups that have long offered these enticements to recruit Syrian fighters. The Free Syrian Army commanders often pleaded with me for such basic items.","Tue, 10 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2014,"['free', 'syrias', 'assad', 'supply', 'opposition', 'syrian', 'qaeda', 'army', 'times', 'syria', 'armed', 'york', 'regime', 'arm']",

The massive tide of unaccompanied children flooding the country illegally isn't expected to end anytime soon

More than 400 children a day are flooding illegally in to the U.S. it has emerged – a situation which further deepens the shocking humanitarian crisis along the border with Mexico.



And the tide of border crossings by unaccompanied children mostly from Central America is not expected to end anytime soon.



This comes as the MailOnline obtained exclusive photos of child immigrants being corralled by staff at a makeshift border patrol warehouse in Nogales, Arizona.

But the center can no longer accommodate large numbers of children and mothers traveling with their kids, forcing the federal government to open more facilities and move many to Nogales for processing.

This figure includes more than 33,000 unaccompanied children.



It’s believed as many as 60,000 unaccompanied children will cross the Mexican border illegally this year in total.

Unaccompanied children and partial families from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala make up the majority of those crossing the border.



Of the 1,200 or so crossing the Rio Grande in eastern Texas every day, up to 400 are unaccompanied children, said Rep. Henry Cuellar, who represents the district where most of the crossings occur. 'This is a humanitarian crisis,' he told CNN.



It’s believed many of the immigrants use rafts to cross the Rio Grande, equipped with instructions to follow the river until reaching the Border Patrol site to surrender.



The illegal immigrants include a group of Honduran girls, some as young as 14, according to CNN.



The Government is not releasing the statistics or much information about the recent influx.



But Chris Cabrera, a labor leader for Border Patrol agents, told CNN that he expects 60,000 unaccompanied children will cross the border this year.



'You're talking kids from 17 years old on down to some that are 5 or 6 years old, traveling by themselves,' Mr Cabrera said.

Many in Congress have blamed President Barack Obama for policies they claim opened the floodgate of unaccompanied child immigrants.

Senator John McCain (R-AZ) told reporters on Capitol Hill Tuesday said that he didn’t think that the illegal children should be allowed to stay.



He also criticized the false message of amnesty to illegal immigrants which was drawing them to cross before immigration reform passed.



‘The word has spread, “Get up there before the immigration bill is passed and you will be eligible for citizenship,'” he said.



‘The word is out that if you can get here before passage of immigration reform, you can get a free ride – and that’s not true.’



McCain admitted that the latest crisis at the border would significantly harm any effort to pass some sort of immigration bill.



“It’s terrible, it’s terrible,"" he said. ""And it is harming our chances of getting comprehensive immigration reform done because people are so angry about this.”

Large green screens were used to keep the children hidden at the Nogales Border Patrol station in Arizona

According to the Houston Chronicle, several advocacy organizations have lodged complaints with Department of Homeland Security officials on behalf of more than 100 unaccompanied youths alleging mistreatment by Customs and Border Patrol agents within the past year.



Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson testified on Wednesday before a Congressional committee that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has 70 personnel dedicated full time to coordinating humanitarian relief efforts for the surge of unaccompanied children caught at the border.



The government has resorted to using three military installations to house an overflow of child immigrants, including an Air Force base in San Antonio, Texas.



The situation is so bad that some officials have described the crisis being akin to that of Hurricane Katrina - a disaster which displaced more than 400,000 people in Louisiana.



'How do you prepare for that?' Don Ray, the Executive Director of the Texas Border Sheriffs Coalition, told KRLD in Texas.



'You can’t have an influx of people like that without having an impact; I think we saw that after Katrina. It’s relocation services that are really taking place. In the case of Katrina, most of them were United States citizens or people that were here lawfully, and now you have people that aren’t here lawfully.'

More than 160,000 immigrants have been apprehended in Texas' Valley sector in the first eight months of this fiscal year - more than all of last year

What’s worse it has been reported that many illegal immigrants signal federal officials to detain them once they are near the border because they believe they will get a ‘pass’ to enter the U.S.



This comes after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials have declared they may not pursue all illegal immigrants who do not show up for hearings after they enter the country.



According to Yoselin Ramos of the Los Angeles Times, an illegal immigrant from Guatemala who was with '20 other families with children,' actually 'had looked forward to being caught.'



She said at one point she even waved down patrol helicopters - because of the welcoming treatment she assumed he would receive.



In their home countries south of the border, reports have been circulating that illegal immigrants, especially those with children, will be allowed to stay in America 'indefinitely.'



Ramos said she decided to make the trek after hearing reports 'that parents will not be detained in the U.S. if they arrive with a child.'



The Obama administration is attributing the huge influx to violence in poverty stricken nations such as Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.



But some members of Congress say Obama's policies and a lack of enforcement are to blame.

At the base, children are provided with three hot meals and two snacks a day. They can call home twice a week. They have access to mental health clinicians and on-site medical care

The minors flooding over the border are often teenagers leaving behind poverty or violence in Mexico and other parts of Central America such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala

‘The President has sent the message out he is not going to enforce the law,’ Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican whose commentary on immigration reform drew sharp criticism, told CNN.



‘That message has echoed out.’



Critics, such as King, point to Obama's decision in 2012 to stop most deportations of young people brought to the United States as children.



After the children at Nogales have been processed, they will be transferred to Department of Health and Human Services run facilities at Lackland Air Base in Texas or Ventura County Naval Base in California.



The administration announced that a third facility in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, which will house up to 1,200 minors.



U.S. law prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from immediately deporting the children if they are not from Canada or Mexico.



Instead, the children are turned over to Department Health and Human Services supervision 'within 72 hours of DHS taking them into custody,' an official said.

Over 400 children a day are coming and as many as 60,000 will cross the Mexican border illegally this year

Relatives living in the U.S. are searched for and contacted and the immigrant is given a court date.



But very few actually show up and the children often become one of the millions of undocumented immigrants.



Tonight an organization of former Border Patrol agents charged that the federal government, under the administration of President Obama, is deliberately arranging for a flood of immigrant children to arrive in America for political purposes.



'This is not a humanitarian crisis. It is a predictable, orchestrated and contrived assault on the compassionate side of Americans by her political leaders that knowingly puts minor illegal alien children at risk for purely political purposes,' said the statement released by the National Association of Former Border Patrol Officers.

Officials said about 60 percent of the children being held in Nogales are boys.



Most of them are in the 15-17 age range, but there are many as young as three and four and teen mothers with their babies.

The Border Patrol refurbished the old Factory 2-U warehouse in the mid 2000s to quickly process Mexican nationals, but it closed several years ago as the wave of immigrants slowed

About 82 percent of them were apprehended by the Border Patrol in South Texas - a region that has seen the largest influx of children - and the rest from Arizona.

So far, more than 100 of the children have been transferred to an Office of Refugee Resettlement-contracted shelter, where officials seek to reunite them with relatives or parents already in the U.S. while their immigration cases are pending.



Jimena Díaz, consul of Guatemala in Phoenix, told the Arizona Star that on Friday another 130 will be transferred to a military base in Ventura County, California, one of several the Defense Department has made available to temporarily house the children.



Around 300 are scheduled to leave Saturday, but she didn't know to where.



Normally, Customs and Border Protection has to turn over the youth to the Office of Refugee Resettlement within 72 hours, but due to the surge, the agency has run out of space.

46,46,FL-2014-000080-CHN,Phoenix police arrest murder suspect hours before requiem Mass - The Catholic Sun,https://www.catholicsun.org/2014/06/16/phoenix-police-arrest-murder-assault-suspect-hours-before-requiem-mass/,"Clergy, religious and laity jammed into St. Catherine of Siena Parish for a standing-room-only requiem Mass for Fr. Kenneth Walker June 16.

The 28-year-old priest was murdered June 11 in an incident that left another priest critically injured at the rectory of the church that stands in the shadows of the state capitol buildings.

Phoenix police announced hours before the Mass that they have a suspect in custody for the crime.

Gary Michael Moran, 54, a transient who was released from prison in April, was arrested June 15 at 9 p.m. at a psychiatric treatment center some four miles northwest of Mater Misericordiae Mission.

Phoenix police chief Daniel Garcia said the attack on the two priests was a “horrific crime” and that the department felt an urgency to find the perpetrator.

Garcia, along with Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton and other city officials, attended the requiem Mass prior to a noon press conference at police headquarters. Garcia noted that the Catholic community had “come together as a family to support each other” in the aftermath of the attack.

“I’m very pleased we were able to make this arrest,” Garcia said. “We wanted to bring closure as quickly as possible in this case.”

Moran has a long history of criminal activity, police say, including arrests for assault, burglary, prohibited possession of a weapon, theft of a vehicle and illegal drugs. He was released from jail in April after serving more than 85 percent of his sentence for burglary and aggravated assault.

The judge set Moran’s bail at $1 million cash only.

At the time of his arrest, Moran was in a wheelchair, but police do not believe he is wheelchair-bound. According to police, Fr. Terra and Fr. Walker did not know Moran.

Garcia said there was no warrant out for Moran’s arrest, but that members of the community came forward via the Silent Witness program and offered information that led to the arrest.

Moran made admissions about the attack on the priests during his interrogation by detectives but ultimately invoked his right to an attorney.

“We believe this was a crime of opportunity,” Garcia said.

Fr. Terra, police said, heard a noise outside the rectory and opened the door to investigate, only to be attacked. Fr. Walker heard the melee and came from his room. That’s when the suspect allegedly shot him.

Police say that Fr. Terra was beaten with an angled iron during the assault and that the gun used in the murder belonged to Fr. Terra. Moran was able to overpower Fr. Terra and take the weapon from him.

An innocent victim

At the requiem Mass, Fr. Eric Flood, the North American superior of the Fraternity of St. Peter Society, the religious order Fr. Walker belonged to, spoke about the young priest’s love of celebrating Mass.

“If someone were to ask him if he would still want to be priest if he knew he would someday be killed, he would probably say yes,” Fr. Flood said, “even to say Mass just once.”

He also offered what he said would be Fr. Walker’s advice to the killer.

“His advice would probably be that he should grow in his friendship with God. Fr. Walker would say that there was a thief crucified alongside Christ, and our Lord turned to him and said, ‘This day you will be with Me in Paradise,’” Fr. Flood said.

Fr. Joseph Terra, in spite of his severe injuries, attended the requiem Mass where he sat in a wheelchair near the altar. His arms were bandaged and he kept his head lowered throughout the service that was celebrated in Latin. The faithful of Mater Misericordiae Mission gather daily for the Tridentine Mass.

Bishop Thomas J. Olmsted of the Diocese of Phoenix offered his condolences to the community at the loss of Fr. Walker.

“His two years of being a priest were a blessing to all of us,” Bishop Olmsted said.

He also spoke to the many priests gathered for the somber Mass.

“We feel a great fraternal love and great closeness to one another as we work together to serve Christ and His Church,” Bishop Olmsted said. “We’ve lost a beloved brother.”

In spite of the tragic loss, Bishop Olmsted offered words of hope. Jesus, by His death, overcame death, the bishop said. Christ is not only the perfect High Priest, He is also the innocent Victim, just as Fr. Walker was an innocent victim of a violent crime.

“He fell asleep in Christ and awaked into the loving arms of his Savior, and with that hope we go forward honoring him and seeking ourselves to be faithful followers of Christ,” Bishop Olmsted said.

At the press conference held at police headquarters, Phoenix City Councilman Michael Nowakowski said he believed Fr. Walker would want the community to come up with a plan to help those recently released from prison to reintegrate into society. Moran was splitting the time since his arrest between living on the streets and in shelters.","Mon, 16 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.catholicsun.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IMG_2655.jpg,"['requiem', 'terra', 'arrest', 'priest', 'fr', 'say', 'christ', 'walker', 'bishop', 'mass', 'murder', 'hours', 'suspect', 'phoenix', 'olmsted']",

QSE claims that they are now the largest solar power producer in the region with 300 MW capacity, eclipsing the United Arab Emirates, which recently ranked third in the world for Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) after Spain and the United States.

At the unveiling, which was attended by a host of dignitaries, QSE told Al Jazeera that they have plans to expand their capacity to 2.5GW, though board member Reyad Fezzani was not willing to predict when they might reach that goal.

“It’s an exciting future for solar energy and we haven’t even scratched the surface,” Fezzani told journalists during a tour of the facility outside of Doha.

Qatar is the sixth largest producer of natural gas, and many of its citizens are among the world’s wealthiest, but the emirate has long recognized the need to bring more renewable energy on board to cope with such difficulties as water scarcity and finite fossil fuels.

“In line with Qatar’s 2030 Vision, we are making tangible and determined steps towards deploying new and renewable energy and establishing Qatar as a technology development and research hub in these new energy industries,” says QSE on their website.

In order to help facilitate research and development, the group established the Al Jazari Center of Excellence is said to host a “highly skilled and equipped R&D Lab Center.”

Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, attended Sunday’s inauguration, Al Jazeera reports.

“What impresses me is that it’s driven by a visionary view of what we should be doing for the future,” he told the paper, adding the facility was “beyond state-of-the-art.”

Authorities in China released pictures of gadgets used to cheat exams

Pupils using hidden cameras to take pictures of papers and questions

Antenna sends image to someone outside who relays answer using earpiece

Tough entrance exams are taken across the country by 9.4million students

Students terrified that families will punish them harshly if they fail tests

Chinese authorities have exposed some of the 007-style gadgets that students have been caught using to try and cheat their way through tough university entrance exams.

Security staff in Jinlin, Jiangsu and Guangdong provinces have revealed students are using sophisticated radio vests in order to receive help from someone outside the hall.

Pupils take pictures of the tests using a button-hole camera hidden in a pen or watch, then use a copper antenna loop stitched into their clothing to beam it out of the hall to someone sitting with a receiver.

Chinese authorities have revealed techniques used by pupils to cheat tough university entrance exams. This system uses a copper antenna (top) to beam images out of the exam hall, then a cheap mobile connected to a hidden earpiece (bottom right) to get answers back, with batteries to power the ensemble (left)

Students take pictures of test papers and questions using button-hole cameras hidden in pens (pictured, camera circled) which are then sent to someone outside the hall using an antenna

Police display receiver equipment used by somebody outside the exam hall to pick up the pictures. That person then looks up the answer, before reading it back to the student

The helper then looks up the answer to the question, and relays it back to a mobile phone hidden on the pupil in the exam hall.The speech is picked up via the mobile, then sent on to a hidden earpiece.

Police in Hubei, Shandong and Hebei provinces have busted a number of suspected criminal groups helping senior year students to cheat on the National Higher Education Entrance Examination.

The exam, known as the 'gaokao', takes place on June 7 and 8 this year, and will be taken by 9.5million children hoping to get into universities across the country.

Education is highly valued in China, with many parents sending their children miles each day just to go to school, and many are afraid they will be harshly punished for failure.

'Education and police authorities will continue to investigate crimes including stealing and selling examination papers, leaking information to exam sitters, providing equipment designed for cheating, and cyber attacks on exam websites,' said an education department spokesman.

The mobile is connected to a hidden earpiece which allows the pupil to listen to the answer without attracting attention from exam invigilators

The whole kit can be concealed inside something as small as a vest, with the antenna stitched into the neckband and everything else tucked into pockets or down trousers

Authorities in China say they have rumbled criminal gangs manufacturing these systems for students. They favour cheap mobile handsets as they are easier to dismantle and then rebuilt including the antenna and earpiece

He warned that cheating students would be stripped of the enrollment qualification for a period ranging from one to three years. Parents involved will also be seriously punished.

Earlier this week it was revealed how one Chinese school has become a place of pilgrimage for anxious parents and children who come to pray there.

The school has an outstanding academic record, which has led to superstitions among locals that praying there will help pupils pass exams.

The school also has a huge 'tree of knowledge' that stands inside the grounds, which people think has magical powers to make children excel in tests.

Another, slightly more sophisticated, system sees the camera hidden in a watch (bottom left) which then transmits wirelessly to a receiver (in the box) with a person feeding answers back through and earpiece (right, in the small white box)

49,49,FL-2014-000080-CHN,Rain-making project holds out hope in bad monsoon year - Livemint,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/nwLaR7vlNeCfHODuNZxRHM/Rainmaking-project-holds-out-hope-in-bad-monsoon-year.html,"New Delhi: Amid disappointing forecasts for rainfall in the June-September monsoon, the government is working on bringing rain through another method—cloud seeding—that senior scientists say is set to become an important part of India’s weather management.

The method involves trying to modify the weather by changing the amount of precipitation—any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapour that falls under gravity—in clouds to either increase or decrease rainfall.

This is done by dispensing cloud seeds—known scientifically as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)—at the base of clouds from a special seeder aircraft. The cloud seeds help turn water vapour into its liquid state—a process known as condensation—and thus create rainfall.

Conversely, the clouds can be blasted with large water-

absorbing particles such as salt to decrease rainfall.

The twin technologies are useful because India, unlike many other countries, often has to deal with both drought and flood conditions in different parts of the country.

The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), a part of the ministry of earth sciences, has launched the third and latest phase of an experiment that began in 2003. The first part of the current phase, spanning 2014 and 2015, will be conducted from Varanasi, which will be the base station for the central Indian region, the focus of the experiment.

To be sure this is not the first time the government is attempting cloud seeding—it has been tried in various states with varying degrees of success. This year’s experiment is, however, significant in the context of the sub-par monsoon forecast. Central India is likely to be one of the regions that will see deficient rains.

This year’s experiment will focus on investigating how aerosols, which are minute particles suspended in the atmosphere, can lead to strengthening of clouds and help develop a basis for direct observations on the characteristics that determine rainy and dry monsoon conditions.

“Ground-based observations have already begun in the Varanasi station, and will continue till the end of monsoon,"" said Thara Prabhakaran, a senior scientist at IITM, which has been conducting cloud seeding experiments since the 1970s.

The current IITM experiment is called the Cloud Aerosol Interaction and Precipitation Enhancement Experiment (CAIPEEX), which aims to investigate the interaction between aerosol and cloud precipitation in various parts of India and to carry out cloud seeding over Varanasi in central India.

In 2003, when the first cloud-seeding operations were carried out in Andhra Pradesh, no change was detected in rainfall. But after the first phase of CAIPEEX was carried out in 2009, also in Andhra Pradesh, more than 17% of rainfall in the 12 districts was attributed to cloud seeding.

The second phase was carried out from 2010 to 2011, when the main focus was to collect more samples of clouds that were seeded.

“Since the experiment started late in the monsoon season due to delay in the hurdles of permission of import of an instrumented aircraft, the samples collected were not enough to make a statistically significant conclusion on the experiment,"" said IITM’s Prabhakaran.

The second part of the current third phase will span 2015 and 2016, when scientists will focus on collecting more seeding samples with a so-called instrumented aircraft—a special plane, imported from the US in this case, consisting of at least 25 instruments that can measure atmospheric properties, observe water droplets and probe aerosols.

“Cloud-seeding operations will take place in June-July in Varanasi to carry experiments to see the interaction between clouds and aerosol. Weather modification operations are really going to gain importance in the coming years,"" said M. Rajeevan, a senior scientist and adviser in the ministry of earth sciences.

“But it is difficult to modify nature, the practicalities are difficult. In some cases it may work, in most it doesn’t,"" Rajeevan added.

In 2008, China attracted global attention when it cleared away rain clouds just before the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. Other countries such as Russia, the US and South Africa, too, have been conducting such experiments with varying degrees of success.

This year, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai has approached IITM to ask if it could help bring artificial rain in certain areas of Mumbai.

“We’re conducting research on clouds and how they develop, and the role of aerosol in precipitation. IITM has no infrastructure, we can only give technical guidance. So far BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) had sent a request; we will provide technical guidance,"" said B.N. Goswami, director, IITM.

51,51,FL-2014-000080-CHN,Flow chart unclear for glacial rivers | News - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/flow-chart-unclear-glacial-rivers/,"A new study examining river basins in the Asia region suggests that amounts of water supplied to the area by glaciers and rainfall in the Himalayas will increase in the coming decades.

At first reading, that looks like good news, as an estimated 1.3 billion people in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, China and elsewhere are dependent for their water supplies on rivers fed by glaciers and snowmelt.

But the less welcome news is that scientists are unsure what will happen after 2050 if the rate at which glaciers melt continues to increase as a result of climate change.

Scientists say rising temperatures and more intense rainfall patterns in the higher Himalayas are causing the retreat of the majority of glaciers in the region.

Heat build-up

They say glacier melt is also being caused by black carbon – particulate matter that, in South Asia, comes mainly from cooking fires, the burning of waste, plus coal burning and diesel exhausts. The black carbon, or soot, falls on the glaciers, reducing reflectivity and increasing heat build-up.

This latest study of glacier melt and water flows, appearing in the journal Nature Climate Change, was carried out by scientists at Future Water, a Netherlands-based research group, Utrecht University, and the Nepal-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development.

“ Long-term outlook is particularly uncertain for the upper Indus basin. While glacier melt contributes only 11.5 per cent of the total runoff in the upper basin of the Ganges river, it contributes more than 40 per cent of total water runoff in the upper Indus basin

It assesses the contribution of glacier and snowmelt to the region’s river basins, incorporating some of the world’s mightiest rivers – the Indus, the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, the Mekong and the Salween.

The scientists say that highly-sophisticated modelling techniques were used to study the river basins in unprecedented detail.

They report: “Despite large differences in runoff composition and regimes between basins and between tributaries within basins, we project an increase in runoff at least until 2050, caused primarily by an increase in precipitation in the upper Ganges, Brahmaputra, Salween and Mekong basins and from accelerated melt in the upper Indus Basin.

“These findings have immediate consequences for climate change policies where a transition towards coping with intra-annual shifts in water availability is desirable.”

Uncertain supplies

But while the study says that, up to mid-century, little change is likely in the amount of glacier melt water flowing into river basins, it is unclear what will happen thereafter to the water supplies for what is a significant portion of the world’s population.

“Our study does not include projections after 2050,” Arthur Lutz, lead author of the study, told Climate News Network. “However, at some point in time, the contribution of glacier melt to the total flow will decrease, because of the decreasing glacier extent. When this happens, it will differ for different river basins and sub-basins.”

The study says the long-term outlook is particularly uncertain for the upper Indus basin. While glacier melt contributes only 11.5 per cent of the total runoff in the upper basin of the Ganges river, it contributes more than 40 per cent of total water runoff in the upper Indus basin.

The Indus river, which flows for nearly 2,000 miles from high up in the Hindu Kush-Karakoram Himalaya mountain range down to the Arabian Sea, is vital to life in Pakistan, providing water for 90 per cent of the country’s agricultural crops. Hydro plants along the Indus also supply about half the country’s electricity.","Fri, 20 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://eco-business.imgix.net/uploads/ebmedia/fileuploads/shutterstock_173870288_glacial_melt_himalayas.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,"['flow', 'river', 'study', 'basins', 'total', 'chart', 'glacier', 'indus', 'glacial', 'unclear', 'water', 'melt', 'upper', 'rivers', 'runoff']",

Ouch. A prostitution ring that had involved over 100 mainland woman who were using WeChat for soliciting was busted in Kowloon, Apple Daily reports, as a total of 75 prostitutes aged 20 to 45 from Sichuan and Hunan holding two-way permits were arrested for breaching the conditions of stay.



The women made use of the “People Nearby” function on WeChat to search for clients nearby after uploading sexy pictures, and charged a price of 1,000 to 1, 200 HKD for every transaction in hotels.

Hong Kong Police and the Immigration Department busted the ring in three hotels in Tsim Sha Tsui and Yau Ma Tei, and are now still investigating the mastermind of the ring.

53,53,FL-2014-000080-CHN,22 Devastating Effects Of Climate Change - Business Insider,https://www.businessinsider.com/effects-of-climate-change-2014-6,"Major negative effects of climate change are here now and they're only getting worse, as shown by recent reports from the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC) and the White House among others.

The greenhouse gas emissions that drive warming ""now substantially exceed the highest concentrations recorded in ice cores during the past 800,000 years,"" the IPCC said. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which primarily come from the burning of fossil fuels, have risen 40% since pre-industrial times.

We've gathered some notable effects of climate change below.

Unless otherwise noted, each effect assumes a temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F) by 2100, a number the IPCC has suggested we are ""more likely than not"" to exceed, and a sea level rise of 0.5 meters (1.5 feet) by 2100, about the average of all the IPCC's most recent climate scenarios. This is a conservative estimate as other studies have suggested that sea level rise will be much greater if climate change continues unmitigated.

1. Climate change will be insanely expensive.

Asset destruction, forced relocations, droughts, extinctions, and all of the other bad things we're going to discuss will add up in costs to the global economy. Already the Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that the U.S. Climate Disruption Budget — i.e., stuff related to drought, storm, and growing climate disruptions — was nearly $100 billion. And that's just the start.

By 2030, climate change costs are projected to cost the global economy $700 billion annually, according to the Climate Vulnerability Monitor.

As climate change continues, costs will go up. Indeed, the release of a 50-billion-ton reservoir of methane from melting Arctic ice, which may advance global warming by 15-to-35 years, could by itself cost $60 trillion to the global economy, researchers told Nature last summer.

Stopping the damage won't be cheap either. For instance, putting the world on a path for sustainable energy production will cost $53 trillion, according to the International Enegy Agency's World Energy Investment Outlook.

2. Hundreds of millions of people may be displaced by 2050.

""98% of all displacement in 2012 was related to climate- and weather-related events,"" according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center. International Displacement Monitering Centre

Climate change may become the biggest driver of displaced people, according to António Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

In 2008, 36 million people were displaced by natural disasters. At least 20 million of those people were driven from their homes by disasters related to climate change like drought and rising sea level, Guterres said.

He anticipates that countries in the Southern Hemisphere will be most affected by displacement in the future. If this happens, ""not only states, but cultures and identities will be drowned,"" Guterres said at a 2009 conference.

The Internal Organization for Migration estimates that 200 million people by 2050 could be forced to leave due to environmental changes.

Even more alarming, a 2014 study published in Environmental Research Letters predicted that sea level rise created by a temperature increase of 3 degrees C would force more than than 600 million people to find new homes.



3. Dengue and malaria could spread in the U.S.

CDC

The deadliest vector-borne disease is malaria, claiming 627,000 lives in 2012 (A vector-borne disease is one carried from one person to another through a third organism, like a blood-sucking bug). ""However, the world's fastest growing vector-borne disease is dengue, with a 30-fold increase in disease incidence over the last 50 years,"" the World Health Organization wrote

As summers become longer, temperatures go up, and rainfall patterns change along with species patterns. Mosquitoes carrying diseases will likely have a longer season in a wider area, according to the Natural Resource Defense Council.

""The same is true on a global scale: increases in heat, precipitation, and humidity can allow tropical and subtropical insects to move from regions where infectious diseases thrive into new places,"" they wrote. Increases in international travel, ""means that the U.S. is increasingly at risk for becoming home to these new diseases.""

For each one degree Celsius of warming, the area burned by western wildfires will increase by a factor of two to four, according to a report by the National Academy of Sciences

Temperatures in the southwest have increased over one degree Celsius since the 1970s, according to the National Climate Assessment.

The major fire increases will occur in the northern Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains, and the Southwest, according to a 2012 report for firescience.gov. The fire season could also become several months longer.

5. An additional 8% of the world population will experience water scarcity by 2100.

In 2013, about 1.3 billion people lived in water scarce regions, according to one study. The researchers calculated that an additional 8% of the population would enter a state of ""new or aggravated water scarcity,"" solely due to climate change with a temperature increase of 2 degrees C by 2100.

The National Climate Assessment detailed some of our Nation's record breaking droughts. In 2011, Texas and Oklahoma saw more than 100 days over almost 28 degrees C, and also set records for hottest summer since 1895, when people began keeping reliable climate records.

""Rates of water loss, due in part to evaporation, were double the long-term average. The heat and drought depleted water resources and contributed to more than $10 billion in direct losses to agriculture alone,"" said the Assessment.

When parched areas do get rain, it does not necessarily make it into groundwater supplies since dry ground is not good at absorbing water, according to the convention report.

While some places are becoming drier, others are in danger of serious floods (see 8 and 13).

6. Hurricanes could become up to 11% more intense and 20% wetter by 2100.

The primary billion dollar disaster for coastal states is hurricanes. Northern and interior states are hit mostly by winter storms and tornadoes, said NOAA. NOAA NCDC

The recent National Climate Assessment found that Category 4 and 5 hurricanes (the strongest) have increased in frequency, intensity, and duration since the 1980s. It's not yet clear how much can be attributed human or natural causes but scientists said the ""the trend is projected to continue,"" and that climate change is not going to help the situation moving forward.

One of the factors responsible for this increase in hurricane intensity is warmer waters, which make great fuel for storms. ""Hurricanes tend to be self-limiting, in that they churn up deeper (usually cooler) water that can stop them from gaining strength and also weaken them. So since global warming also warms the deeper ocean, it further helps hurricanes stay stronger longer,""according to climate writer Joseph Romm.

One model predicts up to an 11% increase in hurricane intensity, as well as about a 20% rain increase within about a sixty mile radius of the storm's center (these numbers are based on a climate scenario with an average of 2.8 degree Celsius warming).

7. Four times as many New Yorkers could live in areas that flood by 2050.

One day, New York City, may have flood days the way it has snow days, Malcolm Bowman, oceanography professor at Stony Brook University in Long Island, warned on WNYC.

The graphic above shows what the Federal Emergency Management Agency flood zone might look like should extreme sea level rise occur (2.5 feet or about 0.8 meters by 2050).

""Areas in the 100-year flood zone have a 1 percent chance of being flooded annually and are particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels,"" NOAA said.

This zone includes several areas devastated by Hurricane Sandy, including the Brooklyn-Queens Waterfront, the East and South Shores of Staten Island, South Queens, Southern Brooklyn, and Southern Manhattan.

Higher sea levels mean higher tides and surges. NOAA

Since the mid-1800s, the chances of storm tide over topping the Manhattan sea wall have increased 20%, according to one recent study, as storm water levels have risen. The researchers expect the seawall to be submerged about once every four to five years. In the 19th century that only happened once every 100 to 400 years.

""What we are finding is that the 10-year storm tide of your great-, great-grandparents is not the same as the 10-year storm tide of today,"" the lead author of the study said in the press release.

Assuming a sea-level rise of .5 meters by 2070, with an extra .5 to 1.5 meters to account for storms, a 2008 study ranked the most exposed cities in the world. The analysis found staggering potential losses in cities around the world.

Calcutta, India, may be the most exposed, with 14 million people and $2 trillion in assets at risk. Miami is also in big trouble with 4.8 million people and $3.5 trillion at risk.

Business Insider 9. 136 of the world's most historic places could be in jeopardy.

If global temperatures rise one degree C, more than 40 of the more than 700 UN world heritage sites will be seriously threatened by water within the next 2000 years, according to a study published in Environmental Research Letters.

If temperatures rise 3 degrees C, that number rises to 136 sites. Historical city centers like Venice, Istanbul, and St. Petersburg, would be among those impacted.

10. Global wheat and maize yields are already beginning to decline.

While warming temperatures might initially help certain crops, the overall picture is negative. Global crop yields are slowing down as a result of events related to climate change, like reduced rainfall and higher temperatures.

Wheat and maize have already been negatively affected in certain regions, as shown in the chart below. The IPCC points out several scenarios in which food and cereal prices have rapidly increased following extreme weather events since their last report in 2007. The new report predicts continued drops in global wheat and maize production, which could lead to food scarcity and political unrest.

11. Some small island nations could be destroyed.

ΔT= Change in degree Celsius. ""Loss of cultural world heritage and currently inhabited places to sea-level rise,"" by Ben Marzeion and Anders Levermann

Low-lying islands in the tropics are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise. ""It has been suggested that the very existence of some atoll nations is threatened by rising sea levels associated with global warming,"" the IPCC said.

Out of the 10 nations rated with the highest protection cost compared to their GDP, eight were island nations, according to the IPCC.

Some of the threats to these islands are less obvious such as ""airborne dust from the Sahara and Asia, distant source ocean swells from mid high latitudes, invasive plant and animal species and the spread of aquatic pathogens,"" the report said.

Sea-level rise leads to flooding, stronger storm surge, and erosion, which can cause even more damage to small islands and coastal regions.

Climate change will also hurt, fisheries agriculture, and tourism in these regions.

12. 100% of reefs may be at risk of extinction by 2050.

When reefs die... NOAA Coral Reef Ecosystem Division

Climate change creates unfavorable conditions for the survival of coral reefs. If global and local reef threats continue, including those related to climate change, all reefs could be at risk of disappearing by 2050, according to the key findings of the World Resources Institute.

Rising ocean acidity created by higher carbon dioxide levels means fewer carbonate ions, a key ingredient for coral skeleton building. Since pre-industrial times, ocean carbonate levels have dropped by 25% according to the report.

""Corals cannot survive more than a 2 degree global average temperature increase over pre-industrial levels before coral is no longer able to replace itself faster than coral bleaching will destroy it,"" the report said. Temperatures are expected to rise at least that much by 2100.

Welcome to our warming world. IPCC The Physical Basics

Losing the reefs will also take a major toll on tourism and industry, according to the World Wildlife Fund and Earth Hour report. Coral reefs provide tourism-related income to at least 94 countries, according to the World Resources Institute. Australia faces loses of up to $6 billion dollars and over 63,000 jobs, from Great Barrier Reef damage.

Seventy percent of the 27 countries and territories most vulnerable to reef damage are small-island states. The nine countries most vulnerable to reef degradation, including Haiti and Fiji, are very dependent on the reefs and ""have limited capacity to adapt to reef loss,"" wrote the World Resources Institute.

Besides being biodiversity hotspots and holding potentials for medicine, coral reefs act as a buffer to storms and erosion. One-hundred countries could lose coastal protection along almost 100,000 miles of shoreline, according to the World Resources Institute.

""Along the Northern Gulf Coast, an estimated 2,400 miles of major roadway and 246 miles of freight rail lines are at risk of permanent flooding within 50 to 100 years as relative sea level is expected to rise in the range of 4 feet,"" according to NOAA. NOAA State Of The Coast

13. Within 300 years, 88% of New Orleans could be underwater.

Since 1993, mean world sea level rise has gone up between 0.11 to 0.14 inches a year, according to NOAA. As this trend continues, coastal areas of the world will be inundated with water.

This is especially disconcerting considering nearly 40% of people in the U.S. live in these coastal areas. Eight out of the 10 largest cities in the world are near the coast.

(The percentages above are based on a New York Times interactive, which used a five-foot sea level rise, a number that is expected to occur within 300 years.)

14. Increasing droughts will make the driest regions even drier.

Using daily precipitation data from 28 models, a 2014 study published in the journal Nature projected the frequency of dry days around the world. It found that the Mediterranean Sea region, parts of Central and South America, and western Indonesia would suffer greatly, with up to 30 extra dry days a year compared to the 1960 to 1989 averageby the end of the century.

""Short-term (seasonal or shorter) droughts are expected to intensify in most U.S. regions. Longer-term droughts are expected to intensify in large areas of the Southwest, southern Great Plains, and Southeast,"" according to the National Climate Assessment.

This month, nearly 15% of the country was in extreme drought, according to NOAA. U.S. Drought Monitor

15. 63% of major wine regions could be jeopardized by 2050.

Droughts could pose a variety of threats, the IPCC said . In areas of higher drought, water stores will not be replenished and water pollutant concentrations could rise. ""Climate change is projected to reduce raw water quality and pose risks to drinking water quality even with conventional treatment.""

As temperature rises many of our current wine producing regions will become unsuitable for vineyards. The number above uses a 1.8 degree C warming and is from a 2012 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.



Problems could be compounded as owners relocate their vineyards to higher elevations — an ecosystem destroying process. Establishing a vineyard requires ""removal of native vegetation, typically followed by deep plowing, fumigation with methyl bromide or other soil-sterilizing chemicals, and the application of fertilizers and fungicides,"" said the study.



Since ""[v]iticulture is famously sensitive to climate,"" the study said, it ""may be illustrative of conservation implications of shifts in other agricultural crops.""

While not all agree with the percentages above, scientists have shown repeatedly that climate change will cause a variety of habitats to become unsuitable for their current inhabitants. This will send many plants and animals in search of new homes, invading those of others.

16. Some reptiles species could turn mostly female, potentially leading to their extinction.

He may soon have way more sisters than he bargained for. Wikimedia/The Canadian Organization for Tropical Education and Rainforest Conservation (COTERC)

Because many reptiles rely on ambient temperatures to regulate physiological processes, they will be directly affected by global temperature change.

For turtles, nest temperature determines the sex of the offspring. A cooler nest hatches only males while a warmer nest is all females. Changes in sex ratio could effect the potential to produce offspring as well as the evolutionary fitness the species, according to the Forest Service, both factors which do not bode well for the survival of the reptiles.

One study in the Cape Verde Islands found that as rising temperatures heated sands in which sea turtles laid their eggs, the nest produced more females. While this may lead to an initial increase in population, 100 years in the future it could spell disaster, study author Graeme Hays told The Guardian. ""You have so few males left that it's likely to be a problem. There will be heaps of female but not enough males to fertilize all those eggs,"" he said.

Animals with similar problems could include other turtles, alligators, crocodiles, and some lizards.

17. Atlanta and New York could see twice as many days of thunderstorms a year by 2100 from the 1962 to 1989 average.

This map compares the summer thunderstorm potential change from 1962-1989 with 2073-2099. NASA Earth Observatory

One study found that when greenhouse gases increased, conditions prime for intense thunderstorms in the eastern and southern U.S. also increased. Other climate studies have suggested there will be ""robust increases in the occurrence of severe thunderstorm environments"" in the eastern U.S., often occurring before the 2 degrees C global warming baseline.

One key factor that fuels thunderstorm formation is how much ""raw energy"" — called convective available potential energy or CAPE — is available. CAPE is affected by how much heat and moisture is in the air, as well as that air's tendency to rise, explains NASA's Earth Observatory.

""CAPE can provide storms with the raw fuel to produce rain and hail, and vertical wind shear can pull and twist weak storms into strong, windy ones,"" meteorologist Harold Brooks of NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory told the Earth Observatory. Signs indicate that CAPE will be increasing as the climate warms.

18. Many countries are losing their main dry season water source.

Over one billion people worldwide rely on glaciers and snow for freshwater as they melt, according to the IPCC.

When glaciers are in equilibrium with the climate, they act as valuable and stable sources of freshwater for many regions including the Andes, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and parts of India and China. They store water during cold or wet years and release it during warm years as they melt. ""As glaciers shrink, however, their diminishing influence may make the water supply less dependable,"" the report said.

Because glaciers are currently out of equilibrium, ""total meltwater yields from stored glacier ice will increase in many regions during the next decades but decrease thereafter,"" the IPCC said. This can lead to floods in the immediate future, but result in a lack of meltwater in the long-term.

19. Air Pollution in California could created a serious public health hazard.

Adverse conditions associated with a changing climate could worsen Southern California's air quality, the state's clean air progress report suggested.

""The higher number of extreme heat days and heat waves predicted to occur as a result of climate change will increase smog formation, increase the number and severity of wildfires, worsen heat island effects in urban areas, and increase adverse health effects due to the public's increased exposure to harmful air pollutants,"" the report said.

Air pollution has been linked to a to a long list of health ailments, including asthma, heart and lung damage, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and heatstroke, the report noted.

Fine particulate matter is the ""greatest risk to public health."" This pollutant has been linked to heart disease , premature mortality and perhaps even diabetes , autism, and cognitive impairment.

20. Equatorial regions and parts of the Antarctic will see up to a 50% decrease in their fisheries.

When the IPCC modeled about 1,000 marine species, it found almost a 50% decrease in catch in certain areas by 2060, using a scenario with a estimated 2.8 degree C temperature change. These analysis were without even considering ocean acidification or overfishing.

21. Some animals are shrinking.

Fossil evidence tells us that when the planet was last at its warmest — about 55 million years ago during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum — many animals got smaller.

For example: One horse, Hyracotherium, usually the size of a small dog, shrunk in size by 30%.

The horse returned to its normal size when the temperature went back down. But two million years later, during another smaller global warming event, Hyracotherium shrunk by 19%.

""The fact that it happened twice significantly increases our confidence that we're seeing cause and effect,"" said University of Michigan Paleontologist Philip Gingerich, who presented his preliminary findings at the end of 2013. Past global warming, he said, appears to have caused many mammals to shrink.

Scientists are now starting to see history repeat itself. Studies have shown that many animals, including polar bears and some reptiles, have started shrinking as carbon dioxide levels increase.

22. An additional 20 million more children will go hungry by 2050.

A report from the World Food Program expects extreme weather events like floods, droughts, forest fires, and tropical cyclones to damage farmlands, threatening food security for millions of people. Climate impacts on crop yields will increase the number of malnourished children by around 11 million in Asia, 10 million in Africa, and 1.4 million in Latin America, the report said.

By 2050, crop yields in Asia are expected to fall by 50% for wheat 17% for rice compared to 2000 levels, according to the report. This will threaten billions of people who rely on agriculture for their livelihoods.","Wed, 11 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.insider.com/537cb37ceab8ea2968dd357d?width=1200&format=jpeg,"['rise', 'increase', 'according', 'climate', 'world', 'sea', 'effects', '22', 'global', 'water', 'report', 'devastating', 'change']",

She finds that U.S. holding facilities can't accommodate children

60,000 unaccompanied minors are projected to illegally cross the border this year

U.S. officials will speak with ambassadors from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras

America's ""urgent humanitarian situation"" begins with a 15-year-old girl from El Salvador who spent 25 days on buses with her younger brother, traveling to the U.S. border.

She and the brother, 12, entered the United States illegally by crossing the Rio Grande River into Texas, and the law caught them a half hour later, the girl told CNN in an interview.

What happened next is when their -- and the nation's -- real problems began.

The siblings are part of a rising tide of unaccompanied migrant children -- mostly from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras -- that's so great that U.S. facilities can't accommodate them all, estimated to total 60,000 this year, federal officials said Thursday.

Federal agencies announced they are stepping up efforts to return the influx of children to home countries.

The 15-year-old girl said the U.S. government wanted to separate the siblings by sending her brother from Texas to San Francisco, but the girl spoke up and said no -- unlike other siblings who were separated because they feared taking a stand against U.S. officials.

But the siblings couldn't use the bathroom in the adult facility in Texas because cameras watched them from the front and behind, she said. The food was awful. And they slept on a bare floor, without blankets. The children used plastic bags or someone's rag to cover themselves, said the teen, whose name is being withheld because she is a minor.

Finally, the U.S. government moved the youngsters together to a California Health & Human Services Agency shelter.

""We didn't suffer there,"" the girl said in an interview, with her immigration attorney. ""They gave us clothes, food and a bed, and everything.""

Department of Homeland Security officials couldn't be immediately reached for comment about the 15-year-old girl's claim, but Secretary Jeh Johnson told reporters Thursday that, in general, it was ""hazardous to send a child into South Texas to a processing center and a number of us here have seen them ourselves, (they) are no place for children.""

In disaster-like mode

On Thursday, U.S. officials addressed this rising tide of unaccompanied migrant children and pledged to use a framework typically used in disasters to ensure the minors are safely detained.

In addition to deploying the Coast Guard to transport and the military to house the undocumented youths, Johnson is talking with the ambassadors of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Mexico to discuss ""faster repatriation,"" he said.

More immigration judges will be assigned for speedier removal proceedings, he said.

While Johnson suggested that unaccompanied minors are rushing to the border to take advantage of a deferred-deportation U.S. policy, the 15-year-old girl stated a dramatically different motivation for her perilous journey: violence in her home country. She and her brother left El Salvador on March 5.

""The reason I came is because we were in danger over there,"" the girl said. ""My mom and dad said we were better off coming here, that's all I can say.""

Lindsay Toczylowski, an immigration attorney with the Los Angeles immigrant rights group Esperanza, said her agency's interviews with more than 1,000 undocumented minors found Central America violence as the reason behind children daring to illegally enter the United States alone or with siblings.

""The levels of violence in central America is really big and there's a crisis,"" said Toczylowski, who is also an attorney for the girl and her brother.

U.S. law toward Central American minors

Johnson said that three-fourths of the unaccompanied children crossing the border come from three Central American countries: Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. Federal law requires different treatment for undocumented minors from those nations.

Those minors aren't immediately deported, unlike those from Mexico or Canada.

Rather, the Central American minors are turned over to the U.S. Department Health and Human Services within 72 hours of DHS taking them into custody.

The Central American children then may end up in the care of their parents or relatives now living in the United States, and the immigrant is given a court date. But very few actually show up, and the children often become some of the millions of undocumented immigrants, said a union official for U.S. Border Patrol agents.

In fact, U.S. officials found U.S.-based relatives for the 15-year-old El Salvadoran girl and her 12-year-old brother. The siblings were placed in the relatives' care in the Los Angeles area about three weeks ago, the girl said.

With the influx of undocumented children like the 15-year-old girl, U.S. authorities have developed a placement system.

After arrest, the child receives a health screening and undergoes a routine process of fingerprinting and identification. Then the children are sent a short-term center for immunizations and a shelter assignment. The minors are transferred to a shelter until authorities are able to find their parents, relatives or a nonprofit agency sponsor.

If U.S. officials can't find a parent or relative, the child may be placed temporarily in one of three military bases: Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, Naval Base Ventura County in California, or Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The minor also may be placed in the care of nonprofit groups that mostly run group homes, federal officials said.

Urgent situation

Johnson suggested that the Central American families now believe that their undocumented children may be spared from U.S. deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, but such a belief is mistaken because the policy doesn't apply to newly arrived minors, Johnson said.

Johnson said immigrant families may be assuming their undocumented children would some day be eligible for a proposed pathway to citizenship, but current immigration reform proposals don't make such offers, Johnson said.

""Those apprehended at our border are priorities for removal. They are priorities for enforcement of our immigration laws regardless of age,"" Johnson said.

The large number of border crossings by children from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras has been declared by President Barack Obama to be ""an urgent humanitarian situation requiring a unified and coordinated federal response.""

In prior years, about 7,000 to 8,000 unaccompanied minors were caught entering the United States annually, but last year, the number grew to 24,000 and this year's projection is 60,000, federal officials said Thursday.

""Our country is in the midst of a crisis manufactured by President Obama and his administration's refusal to enforce our nation's immigration laws. As a result, thousands of people from Central America -- including unaccompanied children -- are flooding into the United States and not fleeing from, but surrendering to, United States Border Patrol officials,"" Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer wrote in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

She urged the congressional leaders to use their positions and influence to stop the ""massive, unfettered influx.""

The minors have overwhelmed U.S. facilities on the border, which don't have enough food, beds or sanitary facilities.

Those conditions have led to alleged sexual abuse, threats of violence, strip searches and filthy conditions, according to a complaint filed Wednesday by the American Civil Liberties Union and four immigrant rights groups. Those accusations are being made by 116 minors represented by the groups.

The detention centers in Texas can no longer hold the large numbers of unaccompanied children or mothers traveling only with their children, forcing the federal government to open additional facilities.","Fri, 13 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140612165054-lead-dnt-savidge-us-mexico-border-undocumented-immigrant-kids-00011415-story-top.jpg,"['minors', 'border', 'central', 'children', 'officials', 'el', 'problem', 'migration', 'urgent', 'highlights', 'girls', 'undocumented', 'salvadoran', 'americas', 'girl', 'unaccompanied', 'salvador']",

RGJ

It took more than 3,000 hours of work, but the University of Nevada, Reno's concrete canoe team earned the right to compete next week in the national finals in Pennsylvania.

The 16 students from UNR's College of Engineering have labored since last August on the design, material and construction to build ""Alluvium,"" their entry in the 2014 National Concrete Canoe Competition.

The team is scheduled to leave Sunday with the Alluvium to compete in the competition being held at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown.

The Alluvium's blue body stretches 21 feet, 8 inches in length and is 27 inches at its widest point.

Covering its sides is a design based on Nevada's state fossil, the ichthyosaur.

Alluvium, the canoe's name, refers to sediments deposited by flowing water into riverbeds or flood plains. It is in layers of what once was alluvium that fossils of the ichthyosaur — ancient marine reptiles that swam in the ocean that covered central Nevada 225 million years ago — have been found.

The design was the work of Douglas Dorman, a UNR art major who graduated in May and who is a friend of Austin Martin, a co-project manager of the UNR concrete canoe team.

""My buddy Doug came up with some sketches that we decided would be cool,"" Martin said of the ichthyosaur fossil.

Getting the design onto the canoe was another team effort.

""Over spring break, we spent three days sketching, tracing and cutting out stencils,"" Martin said. ""Every piece is its own stencil. We cut out hundreds of pieces and we laid it all out and then we had to glue it all down and spray over it.""

In addition to trying to build canoe that is aesthetically pleasing and swift in the water, there is a more serious purpose to the concrete canoe competition: academics.

Kristin Kramer, the team's other co-project manager, said designing, constructing and racing the canoes requires teamwork and interdisciplinary skills.

""In terms of education, a lot of it is team-based activity, which you don't always get in the classroom,"" Kramer said.

""It also makes you think outside of the box. You're not following a set of instructions and things go wrong, so you have to figure out how to make things work based on the various challenges you run into, which are different every year,"" she said.

This year, the team had trouble getting the concrete mix right so they could cast and pour the body of the canoe. That put them a month behind their schedule.

""It completely threw off the rest of our schedule,"" Kramer said. ""We ended up having to evaluate the rest of our plan and figure out how we could be more efficient with our conception and finishing processes so we could have a complete canoe in time for the competition.""

Kramer said the team starts with the concrete mix used by the team from the previous mix and then tries to improve on it.

""So we play off of last year's concrete mix, trying to add different things to make it better and to make it stronger,"" she said.

""This year we tried to make it where it had a better finish because last year it had a lot of fuzzy things on the outside,"" she said. ""We did use one new thing this year which was a special water-proofing chemical add mixture that helps prevent water from seeping into the concrete. It's kind of cutting-edge. Not a lot of schools are using it.""

The teams qualify for the national competition by placing first in one of the 18 conference competitions held throughout the United States and in Canada during the spring.

The competition has been going global in recent years, and this year's competitors include Tongji University in Shanghai, China.

The canoe races are the showy part of the competition and a crowd-pleaser, but the winning team has to do more than paddle the fastest.

The top team is the one that gets the highest total score based on four categories: the canoe's construction and design, a technical paper, an oral presentation, and performance in five different race events.

""And I think Kristin and I produced a great design report, too,"" Martin said. ""Our school is pretty well-known for taking first place in design report. Every year since 2007, we have taken first place in the design report category.""

Since 2007, UNR's team also has finished in the top five overall at the national competition, winning first place in 2008.

Kramer and Martin said the toughest teams to beat this year will be the Université Laval; California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo; the University of Florida and the University of Wisconsin- Madison.

But the two co-project managers think UNR's team has a good chance at taking first place this year in the Alluvium.

""We're out here as a team for four hours every Saturday and Sunday, and we do individual practices during the weekdays for about five hours,"" Kramer said, last week as the men and women practiced their paddling technique at the Sparks Marina.

""I think we're really looking good,"" Martin said as he watched the practice. ""As you can see, the paddlers are working their asses off, and that's one-fourth of the competition.""

To clear the lots of the struck vehicles, Woodhouse declared a “hail sale” the day after the storm, marking stickers down by anywhere from $1,000 to $15,000. Lisa Cole, Woodhouse Family Auto marketing director, said in an e-mail that by Saturday, more than 150 customers were waiting to speak with a salesperson. Woodhouse’s Web site said e-mails and phone messages may not be returned for two to three weeks.

Woodhouse Ford said all of its 2,500 pickups at “Truck Mountain” were damaged. The dealership is the nation’s top-selling store for F-series pickups.

The situation in Nebraska underscores how dealerships can use “hail sales” to sell vehicles with dents or cracked windshields -- and attract new customers to their lots.

Tim Olson, president of Dent Terminator, a paintless dent repair company in Tulsa, Okla., said in such situations, customers feel as if they have the upper hand.

“It’s like blood in the water,” Olson said. “People sense that [dealerships] are at a disadvantage, bringing people into the marketplace that weren’t there before.”

Peak Kia in Littleton, Colo., has been holding a hail sale since storms on May 20 and May 24 damaged 425 vehicles, creating an average of $6,000 worth of damage per car.

Bill Byerly, owner of Peak Kia, said about one-third of the discounted vehicles were sold the weekend following the storm.

“We want to try to retail everything,” Byerly said on June 9. “We may sell them all in a month or six weeks from now.”

Byerly said past hail sales have proven profitable for Peak Kia, but they won’t know the effect of the latest storms until the end of the month. Kia has been providing the dealership with fresh inventory to replace the rapidly sold hail-damaged vehicles.

While hail sales are an effective way of clearing lots for dealers, the discounts may not be as equally beneficial for customers. Olson said that if a hail-damaged vehicle isn’t repaired after purchase, insurance companies can discount the damage from future accident coverage.

“There are benefits for consumers, but also ‘gotchas,’” Olson said. “…When [an insurance company] looks at a car and sees hail damage, they figure what that would have cost and deduct it from the current cost of the accident.”

Olson said an indicator of the severity of hail damage is if the paint is broken or cracked at the edges of the vehicle’s panels. Such damage would cause the car to rust within six months.

Dealerships can hire PDR companies to do repairs on site, or repair lightly damaged vehicles in their service centers to further incentivize customers. Olson said competitive pricing among PDR companies allows for high profit margins for the dealerships that hire them.

Cole said in an e-mail that Woodhouse was repairing some of the discounted vehicles at the dealerships. However, it is too soon to tell if the massive sale will be profitable.

Mark Cooley, general manager at Nebraska Auto Auction Inc. in Lincoln, said the auction house is expecting to receive vehicles damaged in the June 3 storm soon, though it is too soon to know how many and which dealers will be selling them.

“The [insurance] adjusters have been way behind,” Cooley said. “We usually get a couple hundred, they sell easily.”

He added that the dealerships his firm works with typically end up benefiting since their insurance has paid for the damages.

Cole said in an e-mail that salvaged vehicles will be taken away, but they will try and sell all of the damaged cars.

“The hail sale will continue until all vehicles with damage are sold,” Cole wrote.","Wed, 11 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://s3-prod.autonews.com/s3fs-public/styles/800x600/public/RETAIL_140619960_AR_-1_YLIFLUIBPXXE.jpg,"['wheels', 'sale', 'deals', 'hail', 'damaged', 'dealerships', 'problem', 'vehicles', 'damage', 'woodhouse', 'sell', 'clamor', 'shoppers', 'cars', 'olson', 'customers']",

The Gemasolar solar tower power plant in Fuentes de Andalucía, Seville, Spain, uses unique technology to generate electricity. A circular solar field of 2,650 heliostat mirrors covering 185 hectares concentrates the sun's energy onto the central receiving tower, where the intense heat generated is stored using molten-salt heat storage technology. The heat collected by the salts, capable of reaching temperatures above 5,000C, generates steam and produces electrical power. The surplus heat accumulated during sun hours is stored in the molten-salt tank, allowing Gemasolar to generate electrical power 24 hours a day for many months of the year. Solar efficiency guarantees electrical production for 6,500 hours a year. This provides 1.5 to 3 times more power than other renewable energy sources. The plant could supply clean, safe power to 25,000 homes and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 30,000 tonnes a year.

Fishing communities rely on this flooding to bring an influx of fish and shrimp to the region. With climate change worsening, flood levels are becoming more inconsistent, which has important consequences for the livelihood of locals. In 2012, lower than average flood levels saw fish yields decrease by 40% compared to previous year.

This section of coast has been eroding since Roman times, with many villages having disappeared into the sea and is the fastest eroding coast in Europe. Climate change is speeding up the erosion, with rising sea levels rising, frequent storms and heavy rainfall all playing their part.

A local man who lives in the Krumovgrad area fears that the mine will cause severe water pollution and also pollute the land where he grows his vegetables. Many locals fear that the mine will destroy the farm produce and cause irreversible damage to the environment. Others see the potential for economic improvement and future employment in the area that currently has high levels of youth unemployment.

The forward journey for human civilization will be difficult and dangerous, but it is now clear that we will ultimately prevail. The only question is how quickly we can accelerate and complete the transition to a low-carbon civilization. There will be many times in the decades ahead when we will have to take care to guard against despair, lest it become another form of denial, paralyzing action. It is true that we have waited too long to avoid some serious damage to the planetary ecosystem – some of it, unfortunately, irreversible. Yet the truly catastrophic damages that have the potential for ending civilization as we know it can still – almost certainly – be avoided. Moreover, the pace of the changes already set in motion can still be moderated significantly.

Global Warming’s Terrifying New Math

There is surprising – even shocking – good news: Our ability to convert sunshine into usable energy has become much cheaper far more rapidly than anyone had predicted. The cost of electricity from photovoltaic, or PV, solar cells is now equal to or less than the cost of electricity from other sources powering electric grids in at least 79 countries. By 2020 – as the scale of deployments grows and the costs continue to decline – more than 80 percent of the world’s people will live in regions where solar will be competitive with electricity from other sources.

No matter what the large carbon polluters and their ideological allies say or do, in markets there is a huge difference between “more expensive than” and “cheaper than.” Not unlike the difference between 32 degrees and 33 degrees Fahrenheit. It’s not just a difference of a degree, it’s the difference between a market that’s frozen up and one that’s liquid. As a result, all over the world, the executives of companies selling electricity generated from the burning of carbon-based fuels (primarily from coal) are openly discussing their growing fears of a “utility death spiral.”

Germany, Europe’s industrial powerhouse, where renewable subsidies have been especially high, now generates 37 percent of its daily electricity from wind and solar; and analysts predict that number will rise to 50 percent by 2020. (Indeed, one day this year, renewables created 74 percent of the nation’s electricity!)

Scorched Earth: How Climate Change Is Spreading Drought Throughout the Globe

What’s more, Germany’s two largest coal-burning utilities have lost 56 percent of their value over the past four years, and the losses have continued into the first half of 2014. And it’s not just Germany. Last year, the top 20 utilities throughout Europe reported losing half of their value since 2008. According to the Swiss bank UBS, nine out of 10 European coal and gas plants are now losing money.

In the United States, where up to 49 percent of the new generating capacity came from renewables in 2012, 166 coal-fired electricity-generating plants have either closed or have announced they are closing in the past four and a half years. An additional 183 proposed new coal plants have been canceled since 2005.

To be sure, some of these closings have been due to the substitution of gas for coal, but the transition under way in both the American and global energy markets is far more significant than one fossil fuel replacing another. We are witnessing the beginning of a massive shift to a new energy-distribution model – from the “central station” utility-grid model that goes back to the 1880s to a “widely distributed” model with rooftop solar cells, on-site and grid battery storage, and microgrids.

The principal trade group representing U.S. electric utilities, the Edison Electric Institute, has identified distributed generation as the “largest near-term threat to the utility model.” Last May, Barclays downgraded the entirety of the U.S. electric sector, warning that “a confluence of declining cost trends in distributed solar­photovoltaic-power generation and residential­scale power storage is likely to disrupt the status quo” and make utility investments less attractive.

See the 10 Dumbest Things Said About Global Warming

This year, Citigroup reported that the widespread belief that natural gas – the supply of which has ballooned in the U.S. with the fracking of shale gas – will continue to be the chosen alternative to coal is mistaken, because it too will fall victim to the continuing decline in the cost of solar and wind electricity. Significantly, the cost of battery storage, long considered a barrier to the new electricity system, has also been declining steadily – even before the introduction of disruptive new battery technologies that are now in advanced development. Along with the impressive gains of clean-energy programs in the past decade, there have been similar improvements in our ability to do more with less. Since 1980, the U.S. has reduced total energy intensity by 49 percent.

It is worth remembering this key fact about the supply of the basic “fuel”: Enough raw energy reaches the Earth from the sun in one hour to equal all of the energy used by the entire world in a full year.

In poorer countries, where most of the world’s people live and most of the growth in energy use is occurring, photovoltaic electricity is not so much displacing carbon-based energy as leapfrogging it altogether. In his first days in office, the government of the newly elected prime minister of India, Narendra Modi (who has authored an e-book on global warming), announced a stunning plan to rely principally upon photovoltaic energy in providing electricity to 400 million Indians who currently do not have it. One of Modi’s supporters, S.L. Rao, the former utility regulator of India, added that the industry he once oversaw “has reached a stage where either we change the whole system quickly, or it will collapse.”

Nor is India an outlier. Neighboring Bangladesh is installing nearly two new rooftop PV systems every minute — making it the most rapidly growing market for PVs in the world. In West and East Africa, solar-electric cells are beginning what is widely predicted to be a period of explosive growth.

At the turn of the 21st century, some scoffed at projections that the world would be installing one gigawatt of new solar electricity per year by 2010. That goal was exceeded 17 times over; last year it was exceeded 39 times over; and this year the world is on pace to exceed that benchmark as much as 55 times over. In May, China announced that by 2017, it would have the capacity to generate 70 gigawatts of photovoltaic electricity. The state with by far the biggest amount of wind energy is Texas, not historically known for its progressive energy policies.

The cost of wind energy is also plummeting, having dropped 43 percent in the United States since 2009 – making it now cheaper than coal for new generating capacity. Though the downward cost curve is not quite as steep as that for solar, the projections in 2000 for annual worldwide wind deployments by the end of that decade were exceeded seven times over, and are now more than 10 times that figure. In the United States alone, nearly one-third of all new electricity-generating capacity in the past five years has come from wind, and installed wind capacity in the U.S. has increased more than fivefold since 2006.

For consumers, this good news may soon get even better. While the cost of carbon­based energy continues to increase, the cost of solar electricity has dropped by an average of 20 percent per year since 2010. Some energy economists, including those who produced an authoritative report this past spring for Bernstein Research, are now predicting energy-price deflation as soon as the next decade.

For those (including me) who are surprised at the speed with which this impending transition has been accelerating, there are precedents that help explain it. Remember the first mobile-telephone handsets? I do; as an inveterate “early adopter” of new technologies, I thought those first huge, clunky cellphones were fun to use and looked cool (they look silly now, of course). In 1980, a few years before I bought one of the early models, AT&T conducted a global market study and came to the conclusion that by the year 2000 there would be a market for 900,000 subscribers. They were not only wrong, they were way wrong: 109 million contracts were active in 2000. Barely a decade and a half later, there are 6.8 billion globally. These parallels have certainly caught the attention of the fossil-fuel industry and its investors: Eighteen months ago, the Edison Electric Institute described the floundering state of the once-proud landline-telephone companies as a grim predictor of what may soon be their fate.

The utilities are fighting back, of course, by using their wealth and the entrenched political power they have built up over the past century. In the United States, brothers Charles and David Koch, who run Koch Industries, the second-largest privately owned corporation in the U.S., have secretively donated at least $70 million to a number of opaque political organizations tasked with spreading disinformation about the climate crisis and intimidating political candidates who dare to support renewable energy or the pricing of carbon pollution.

A Call to Arms: An invitation to Demand Action on Climate Change

They regularly repeat shopworn complaints about the inadequate, intermittent and inconsistent subsidies that some governments have used in an effort to speed up the deployment of renewables, while ignoring the fact that global subsidies for carbon-based energy are 25 times larger than global subsidies for renewables.

One of the most effective of the groups financed by the Koch brothers and other carbon polluters is the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, which grooms conservative state legislators throughout the country to act as their agents in introducing legislation written by utilities and carbon-fuel lobbyists in a desperate effort to slow, if not stop, the transition to renewable energy.

The Kochs claim to act on principles of low taxation and minimal regulation, but in their attempts to choke the development of alternative energy, they have induced the recipients of their generous campaign contributions to contradict these supposedly bedrock values, pushing legislative and regulatory measures in 34 states to discourage solar, or encourage carbon energy, or both. The most controversial of their initiatives is focused on persuading state legislatures and public-utility commissions to tax homeowners who install a PV solar cell on their roofs, and to manipulate the byzantine utility laws and regulations to penalize renewable energy in a variety of novel schemes.

The chief battleground in this war between the energy systems of the past and future is our electrical grid. For more than a century, the grid – along with the regulatory and legal framework governing it – has been dominated by electric utilities and their centralized, fossil-fuel-powered­ electricity-generation plants. But the rise of distributed alternate energy sources allows consumers to participate in the production of electricity through a policy called net metering. In 43 states, homeowners who install solar PV to systems on their rooftops are permitted to sell electricity back into the grid when they generate more than they need.

These policies have been crucial to the growth of solar power. But net metering represents an existential threat to the future of electric utilities, the so-called utility death spiral: As more consumers install solar panels on their roofs, utilities will have to raise prices on their remaining customers to recover the lost revenues. Those higher rates will, in turn, drive more consumers to leave the utility system, and so on.

But here is more good news: The Koch brothers are losing rather badly. In Kansas, their home state, a poll by North Star Opinion Research reported that 91 percent of registered voters support solar and wind. Three-quarters supported stronger policy encouragement of renewable energy, even if such policies raised their electricity bills.

In Georgia, the Atlanta Tea Party joined forces with the Sierra Club to form a new organization called – wait for it – the Green Tea Coalition, which promptly defeated a Koch-funded scheme to tax rooftop solar panels.

Meanwhile, in Arizona, after the state’s largest utility, an ALEC member, asked the public-utility commission for a tax of up to $150 per month for solar households, the opposition was fierce and well-organized. A compromise was worked out – those households would be charged just $5 per month – but Barry Goldwater Jr., the leader of a newly formed organization called TUSK (Tell Utilities Solar won’t be Killed), is fighting a new attempt to discourage rooftop solar in Arizona. Characteristically, the Koch brothers and their allies have been using secretive and deceptive funding in Arizona to run television advertisements attacking “greedy” owners of rooftop solar panels – but their effort has thus far backfired, as local journalists have exposed the funding scam.

Even though the Koch-funded forces recently scored a partial (and almost certainly temporary) victory in Ohio, where the legislature voted to put a hold on the state’s renewable-portfolio standard and study the issue for two years, it’s clear that the attack on solar energy is too little, too late. Last year, the Edison Electric Institute warned the utility industry that it had waited too long to respond to the sharp cost declines and growing popularity of solar: “At the point when utility investors become focused on these new risks and start to witness significant customer- and earnings-erosion trends, they will respond to these challenges. But, by then, it may be too late to repair the utility business model.”

The most seductive argument deployed by the Koch brothers and their allies is that those who use rooftop solar electricity and benefit from the net-metering policies are “free riders” – that is, they are allegedly not paying their share of the maintenance costs for the infrastructure of the old utility model, including the grid itself. This deceptive message, especially when coupled with campaign contributions, has persuaded some legislators to support the proposed new taxes on solar panels.

But the argument ignores two important realities facing the electric utilities: First, most of the excess solar electricity is supplied by owners of solar cells during peak-load hours of the day, when the grid’s capacity is most stressed – thereby alleviating the pressure to add expensive new coal- or gas-fired generating capacity. But here’s the rub: What saves money for their customers cuts into the growth of their profits and depresses their stock prices. As is often the case, the real conflict is between the public interest and the special interest.

The second reality ignored by the Koch brothers is the one they least like to discuss, the one they spend so much money trying to obfuscate with their hired “merchants of doubt.” You want to talk about the uncompensated use of infrastructure? What about sewage infrastructure for 98 million tons per day of gaseous, heat-trapping waste that is daily released into our skies, threatening the future of human civilization? Is it acceptable to use the thin shell of atmosphere surrounding our planet as an open sewer? Free of charge? Really?

This, after all, is the reason the climate crisis has become an existential threat to the future of human civilization. Last April, the average CO2 concentrations in the Earth’s atmosphere exceeded 400 parts-per-million on a sustained basis for the first time in at least 800,000 years and probably for the first time in at least 4.5 million years (a period that was considerably warmer than at present).

According to a cautious analysis by the influential climate scientist James Hansen, the accumulated man-made global-warming pollution already built up in the Earth’s atmosphere now traps as much extra heat energy every day as would be released by the explosion of 400,000 Hiroshima-class nuclear bombs. It’s a big planet, but that’s a lot of energy.

And it is that heat energy that is giving the Earth a fever. Denialists hate the “fever” metaphor, but as the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) pointed out this year, “Just as a 1.4­degree-fever change would be seen as significant in a child’s body, a similar change in our Earth’s temperature is also a concern for human society.”

Thirteen of the 14 hottest years ever measured with instruments have occurred in this century. This is the 37th year in a row that has been hotter than the 20th-century average. April was the 350th month in a row hotter than the average in the preceding century. The past decade was by far the warmest decade ever measured.

Many scientists expect the coming year could break all of these records by a fair margin because of the extra boost from the anticipated El Niño now gathering in the waters of the eastern Pacific. (The effects of periodic El Niño events are likely to become stronger because of global warming, and this one is projected by many scientists to be stronger than average, perhaps on the scale of the epic El Niño of 1997 to 1998.)

The fast-growing number of extreme-weather events, connected to the climate crisis, has already had a powerful impact on public attitudes toward global warming. A clear majority of Americans now acknowledge that man-made pollution is responsible. As the storms, floods, mudslides, droughts, fires and other catastrophes become ever more destructive, the arcane discussions over how much of their extra-destructive force should be attributed to global warming have become largely irrelevant. The public at large feels it viscerally now. As Bob Dylan sang, “You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.”

Besides, there is a simple difference between linear cause and effect and systemic cause and effect. As one of the world’s most-respected atmospheric scientists, Kevin Trenberth, has said, “The environment in which all storms form has changed owing to human activities.”

For example, when Supertyphoon Haiyan crossed the Pacific toward the Philippines last fall, the storm gained strength across seas that were 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they used to be because of greenhouse­gas pollution. As a result, Haiyan went from being merely strong to being the most powerful and destructive ocean-based storm on record to make landfall. Four million people were displaced (more than twice as many as by the Indian Ocean tsunami of 10 years ago), and there are still more than 2 million Haiyan refugees desperately trying to rebuild their lives.

When Superstorm Sandy traversed the areas of the Atlantic Ocean windward of New York and New Jersey in 2012, the water temperature was nine degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal. The extra convection energy in those waters fed the storm and made the winds stronger than they would otherwise have been. Moreover, the sea level was higher than it used to be, elevated by the melting of ice in the frozen regions of the Earth and the expanded volume of warmer ocean waters.

Five years earlier, denialists accused me of demagogic exaggeration in an animated scene in my documentary An Inconvenient Truth that showed the waters of the Atlantic Ocean flooding into the 9/11 Ground Zero Memorial site. But in Sandy’s wake, the Atlantic did in fact flood Ground Zero – many years before scientists had expected that to occur.

Similarly, the inundation of Miami Beach by rising sea levels has now begun, and freshwater aquifers in low-lying areas from South Florida to the Nile Delta to Bangladesh to Indochina are being invaded by saltwater pushed upward by rising oceans. And of course, many low-lying islands – not least in the Bay of Bengal – are in danger of disappearing altogether. Where will the climate refugees go? Similarly, the continued melting of mountain glaciers and snowpacks is, according to the best scientists, already “affecting water supplies for as many as a billion people around the world.”

Just as the extreme-weather events we are now experiencing are exactly the kind that were predicted by scientists decades ago, the scientific community is now projecting far worse extreme-weather events in the years to come. Eighty percent of the warming in the past 150 years (since the burning of carbon-based fuels gained momentum) has occurred in the past few decades. And it is worth noting that the previous scientific projections consistently low-balled the extent of the global­warming consequences that later took place – for a variety of reasons rooted in the culture of science that favor conservative estimates of future effects.

In an effort to avoid these cultural biases, the AAAS noted this year that not only are the impacts of the climate crisis “very likely to become worse over the next 10 to 20 years and beyond,” but “there is a possibility that temperatures will rise much higher and impacts will be much worse than expected. Moreover, as global temperature rises, the risk increases that one or more important parts of the Earth’s climate system will experience changes that may be abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible, causing large damages and high costs.”

Just weeks after that report, there was shock and, for some, a temptation to despair when the startling news was released in May by scientists at both NASA and the University of Washington that the long-feared “collapse” of a portion of the West Antarctic ice sheet is not only under way but is also now “irreversible.” Even as some labored to understand what the word “collapse” implied about the suddenness with which this catastrophe will ultimately unfold, it was the word “irreversible” that had a deeper impact on the collective psyche.

Just as scientists 200 years ago could not comprehend the idea that species had once lived on Earth and had subsequently become extinct, and just as some people still find it hard to accept the fact that human beings have become a sufficiently powerful force of nature to reshape the ecological system of our planet, many – including some who had long since accepted the truth about global warming – had difficulty coming to grips with the stark new reality that one of the long-feared “tipping points” had been crossed. And that, as a result, no matter what we do, sea levels will rise by at least an additional three feet.

The uncertainty about how long the process will take (some of the best ice scientists warn that a rise of 10 feet in this century cannot be ruled out) did not change the irreversibility of the forces that we have set in motion. But as Eric Rignot, the lead author of the NASA study, pointed out in The Guardian, it’s still imperative that we take action: “Controlling climate warming may ultimately make a difference not only about how fast West Antarctic ice will melt to sea, but also whether other parts of Antarctica will take their turn.”

The news about the irreversible collapse in West Antarctica caused some to almost forget that only two months earlier, a similar startling announcement had been made about the Greenland ice sheet. Scientists found that the northeastern part of Greenland – long thought to be resistant to melting – has in fact been losing more than 10 billion tons of ice per year for the past decade, making 100 percent of Greenland unstable and likely, as with West Antarctica, to contribute to significantly more sea-level rise than scientists had previously thought.

The heating of the oceans not only melts the ice and makes hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons more intense, it also evaporates around 2 trillion gallons of additional water vapor into the skies above the U.S. The warmer air holds more of this water vapor and carries it over the landmasses, where it is funneled into land-based storms that are releasing record downpours all over the world.

For example, an “April shower” came to Pensacola, Florida, this spring, but it was a freak – another rainstorm on steroids: two feet of rain in 26 hours. It broke all the records in the region, but as usual, virtually no media outlets made the connection to global warming. Similar “once in a thousand years” storms have been occurring regularly in recent years all over the world, including in my hometown of Nashville in May 2010.

All-time record flooding swamped large portions of England this winter, submerging thousands of homes for more than six weeks. Massive downpours hit Serbia and Bosnia this spring, causing flooding of “biblical proportions” (a phrase now used so frequently in the Western world that it has become almost a cliché) and thousands of landslides. Torrential rains in Afghanistan in April triggered mudslides that killed thousands of people – almost as many, according to relief organizations, as all of the Afghans killed in the war there the previous year.

In March, persistent rains triggered an unusually large mudslide in Oso, Washington, killing more than 40 people. There are literally hundreds of other examples of extreme rainfall occurring in recent years in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania.

In the planet’s drier regions, the same extra heat trapped in the atmosphere by man-made global-warming pollution has also been driving faster evaporation of soil moisture and causing record-breaking droughts. As of this writing, 100 percent of California is in “severe,” “extreme” or “exceptional” drought. Record fires are ravaging the desiccated landscape. Experts now project that an increase of one degree Celsius over pre-industrial temperatures will lead to as much as a 600-­percent increase in the median area burned by forest fires in some areas of the American West – including large portions of Colorado. The National Research Council has reported that fire season is two and a half months longer than it was 30 years ago, and in California, firefighters are saying that the season is now effectively year-round.

Drought has been intensifying in many other dry regions around the world this year: Brazil, Indonesia, central and northwest Africa and Madagascar, central and western Europe, the Middle East up to the Caspian Sea and north of the Black Sea, Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, Western Australia and New Zealand.

Syria is one of the countries that has been in the bull’s-eye of climate change. From 2006 to 2010, a historic drought destroyed 60 percent of the country’s farms and 80 percent of its livestock – driving a million refugees from rural agricultural areas into cities already crowded with the million refugees who had taken shelter there from the Iraq War. As early as 2008, U.S. State Department cables quoted Syrian government officials warning that the social and economic impacts of the drought are “beyond our capacity as a country to deal with.” Though the hellish and ongoing civil war in Syria has multiple causes – including the perfidy of the Assad government and the brutality on all sides – their climate-related drought may have been the biggest underlying trigger for the horror.

The U.S. military has taken notice of the strategic dangers inherent in the climate crisis. Last March, a Pentagon advisory committee described the climate crisis as a “catalyst for conflict” that may well cause failures of governance and societal collapse. “In the past, the thinking was that climate change multiplied the significance of a situation,” said retired Air Force Gen. Charles F. Wald. “Now we’re saying it’s going to be a direct cause of instability.”

Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright told the press, “For DOD, this is a mission reality, not a political debate. The scientific forecast is for more Arctic ice melt, more sea-level rise, more intense storms, more flooding from storm surge and more drought.” And in yet another forecast difficult for congressional climate denialists to rebut, climate experts advising the military have also warned that the world’s largest naval base, in Norfolk, Virginia, is likely to be inundated by rising sea levels in the future.

And how did the Republican-dominated House of Representatives respond to these grim warnings? By passing legislation seeking to prohibit the Department of Defense from taking any action to prepare for the effects of climate disruption.

There are so many knock-on consequences of the climate crisis that listing them can be depressing – diseases spreading, crop yields declining, more heat waves affecting vulnerable and elderly populations, the disappearance of summer-ice cover in the Arctic Ocean, the potential extinction of up to half of all the living species, and so much more. And that in itself is a growing problem too, because when you add it all up, it’s no wonder that many feel a new inclination to despair.

So, clearly, we will just have to gird ourselves for the difficult challenges ahead. There is indeed, literally, light at the end of the tunnel, but there is a tunnel, and we are well into it.

In November 1936, Winston Churchill stood before the United Kingdom’s House of Commons and placed a period at the end of the misguided debate over the nature of the “gathering storm” on the other side of the English Channel: “Owing to past neglect, in the face of the plainest warnings, we have entered upon a period of danger. . . . The era of procrastination, of half measures, of soothing and baffling expedience of delays is coming to its close. In its place, we are entering a period of consequences. . . . We cannot avoid this period; we are in it now.”

Our civilization is confronting this existential challenge at a moment in our historical development when our dominant global ideology – democratic capitalism – has been failing us in important respects.

Democracy is accepted in theory by more people than ever before as the best form of political organization, but it has been “hacked” by large corporations (defined as “persons” by the Supreme Court) and special interests corrupting the political system with obscene amounts of money (defined as “speech” by the same court).

Capitalism, for its part, is accepted by more people than ever before as a superior form of economic organization, but is – in its current form – failing to measure and include the categories of “value” that are most relevant to the solutions we need in order to respond to this threatening crisis (clean air and water, safe food, a benign climate balance, public goods like education and a greener infrastructure, etc.).

Pressure for meaningful reform in democratic capitalism is beginning to build powerfully. The progressive introduction of Internet-based communication – social media, blogs, digital journalism – is laying the foundation for the renewal of individual participation in democracy, and the re-elevation of reason over wealth and power as the basis for collective decision­making. And the growing levels of inequality worldwide, combined with growing structural unemployment and more frequent market disruptions (like the Great Recession), are building support for reforms in capitalism.

Both waves of reform are still at an early stage, but once again, Churchill’s words inspire: “If you’re going through hell, keep going.” And that is why it is all the more important to fully appreciate the incredible opportunity for salvation that is now within our grasp. As the satirical newspaper The Onion recently noted in one of its trademark headlines: “Scientists Politely Remind World That Clean Energy Technology Ready to Go Whenever.”

We have the policy tools that can dramatically accelerate the transition to clean energy that market forces will eventually produce at a slower pace. The most important has long since been identified: We have to put a price on carbon in our markets, and we need to eliminate the massive subsidies that fuel the profligate emissions of global-warming pollution.

We need to establish “green banks” that provide access to capital investment necessary to develop renewable energy, sustainable agriculture and forestry, an electrified transportation fleet, the retrofitting of buildings to reduce wasteful energy consumption, and the full integration of sustainability in the design and architecture of cities and towns. While the burning of fossil fuels is the largest cause of the climate crisis, deforestation and “factory farming” also play an important role. Financial and technological approaches to addressing these challenges are emerging, but we must continue to make progress in converting to sustainable forestry and agriculture.

In order to accomplish these policy shifts, we must not only put a price on carbon in markets, but also find a way to put a price on climate denial in our politics. We already know the reforms that are needed – and the political will to enact them is a renewable resource. Yet the necessary renewal can only come from an awakened citizenry empowered by a sense of urgency and emboldened with the courage to reject despair and become active. Most importantly, now is the time to support candidates who accept the reality of the climate crisis and are genuinely working hard to solve it – and to bluntly tell candidates who are not on board how much this issue matters to you. If you are willing to summon the resolve to communicate that blunt message forcefully – with dignity and absolute sincerity – you will be amazed at the political power an individual can still wield in America’s diminished democracy.

Something else is also new this summer. Three years ago, in these pages, I criticized the seeming diffidence of President Obama toward the great task of solving the climate crisis; this summer, it is abundantly evident that he has taken hold of the challenge with determination and seriousness of purpose.

He has empowered his Environmental Protection Agency to enforce limits on CO2 emissions for both new and, as of this June, existing sources of CO2. He has enforced bold new standards for the fuel economy of the U.S. transportation fleet. He has signaled that he is likely to reject the absurdly reckless Keystone XL-pipeline proposal for the transport of oil from carbon­intensive tar sands to be taken to market through the United States on its way to China, thus effectively limiting their exploitation. And he is even now preparing to impose new limits on the release of methane pollution.

All of these welcome steps forward have to be seen, of course, in the context of Obama’s continued advocacy of a so-called all-of-the-above energy policy – which is the prevailing code for aggressively pushing more drilling and fracking for oil and gas. And to put the good news in perspective, it is important to remember that U.S. emissions – after declining for five years during the slow recovery from the Great Recession – actually increased by 2.4 percent in 2013.

Nevertheless, the president is clearly changing his overall policy emphasis to make CO2 reductions a much higher priority now and has made a series of inspiring speeches about the challenges posed by climate change and the exciting opportunities available as we solve it. As a result, Obama will go to the United Nations this fall and to Paris at the end of 2015 with the credibility and moral authority that he lacked during the disastrous meeting in Copenhagen four and a half years ago.

The international treaty process has been so fraught with seemingly intractable disagreements that some parties have all but given up on the possibility of ever reaching a meaningful treaty.

Ultimately, there must be one if we are to succeed. And there are signs that a way forward may be opening up. In May, I attended a preparatory session in Abu Dhabi, UAE, organized by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to bolster commitments from governments, businesses and nongovernmental organizations ahead of this September’s U.N. Climate Summit. The two-day meeting was different from many of the others I have attended. There were welcome changes in rhetoric, and it was clear that the reality of the climate crisis is now weighing on almost every nation. Moreover, there were encouraging reports from around the world that many of the policy changes necessary to solve the crisis are being adopted piecemeal by a growing number of regional, state and city governments.

For these and other reasons, I believe there is a realistic hope that momentum toward a global agreement will continue to build in September and carry through to the Paris negotiations in late 2015.

The American poet Wallace Stevens once wrote, “After the final ‘no’ there comes a ‘yes’/And on that ‘yes’ the future world depends.” There were many no’s before the emergence of a global consensus to abolish chattel slavery, before the consensus that women must have the right to vote, before the fever of the nuclear­arms race was broken, before the quickening global recognition of gay and lesbian equality, and indeed before every forward advance toward social progress. Though a great many obstacles remain in the path of this essential agreement, I am among the growing number of people who are allowing themselves to become more optimistic than ever that a bold and comprehensive pact may well emerge from the Paris negotiations late next year, which many regard as the last chance to avoid civilizational catastrophe while there is still time.

It will be essential for the United States and other major historical emitters to commit to strong action. The U.S. is, finally, now beginning to shift its stance. And the European Union has announced its commitment to achieve a 40-percent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030. Some individual European nations are acting even more aggressively, including Finland’s pledge to reduce emissions 80 percent by 2050.

It will also be crucial for the larger developing and emerging nations – particularly China and India – to play a strong leadership role. Fortunately, there are encouraging signs. China’s new president, Xi Jinping, has launched a pilot cap-and-trade system in two cities and five provinces as a model for a nationwide cap-and-trade program in the next few years. He has banned all new coal burning in several cities and required the reporting of CO2 emissions by all major industrial sources. China and the U.S. have jointly reached an important agreement to limit another potent source of global-warming pollution – the chemical compounds known as hydro-fluorocarbons, or HFCs. And the new prime minister of India, as noted earlier, has launched the world’s most ambitious plan to accelerate the transition to solar electricity.

Underlying this new breaking of logjams in international politics, there are momentous changes in the marketplace that are exercising enormous influence on the perceptions by political leaders of the new possibilities for historic breakthroughs. More and more, investors are diversifying their portfolios to include significant investments in renewables. In June, Warren Buffett announced he was ready to double Berkshire Hathaway’s existing $15 billion investment in wind and solar energy.

A growing number of large investors – including pension funds, university endowments (Stanford announced its decision in May), family offices and others – have announced decisions to divest themselves from carbon­intensive assets. Activist and “impact” investors are pushing for divestment from carbon­rich assets and new investments in renewable and sustainable assets.

Several large banks and asset managers around the world (full disclosure: Generation Investment Management, which I co-founded with David Blood and for which I serve as chairman, is in this group) have advised their clients of the danger that carbon assets will become “stranded.” A “stranded asset” is one whose price is vulnerable to a sudden decline when markets belatedly recognize the truth about their underlying value – just as the infamous “subprime mortgages” suddenly lost their value in 2007 to 2008 once investors came to grips with the fact that the borrowers had absolutely no ability to pay off their mortgages.

Shareholder activists and public campaigners have pressed carbon-dependent corporations to deal with these growing concerns. But the biggest ones are still behaving as if they are in denial. In May 2013, ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson responded to those pointing out the need to stop using the Earth’s atmosphere as a sewer by asking, “What good is it to save the planet if humanity suffers?”

I don’t even know where to start in responding to that statement, but here is a clue: Pope Francis said in May, “If we destroy creation, creation will destroy us. Never forget this.”

Exxonmobil, Shell and many other holders of carbon-intensive assets have argued, in essence, that they simply do not believe that elected national leaders around the world will ever reach an agreement to put a price on carbon pollution.

But a prospective global treaty (however likely or unlikely you think that might be) is only one of several routes to overturning the fossil-fuel economy. Rapid technological advances in renewable energy are stranding carbon investments; grassroots movements are building opposition to the holding of such assets; and new legal restrictions on collateral flows of pollution – like particulate air pollution in China and mercury pollution in the U.S. – are further reducing the value of coal, tar sands, and oil and gas assets.

In its series of reports to energy investors this spring, Citigroup questioned the feasibility of new coal plants not only in Europe and North America, but in China as well. Although there is clearly a political struggle under way in China between regional governments closely linked to carbon-­energy generators, suppliers and users and the central government in Beijing – which is under growing pressure from citizens angry about pollution – the nation’s new leadership appears to be determined to engineer a transition toward renewable energy. Only time will tell how successful they will be.

The stock exchanges in Johannesburg and São Paulo have decided to require the full integration of sustainability from all listed companies. Standard & Poor’s announced this spring that some nations vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis may soon have their bonds downgraded because of the enhanced risk to holders of those assets.

A growing number of businesses around the world are implementing sustainability plans, as more and more consumers demand a more responsible approach from businesses they patronize. Significantly, many have been pleasantly surprised to find that adopting efficient, low-carbon approaches can lead to major cost savings.

And all the while, the surprising and relentless ongoing decline in the cost of renewable energy and efficiency improvements are driving the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Is there enough time? Yes. Damage has been done, and the period of consequences will continue for some time to come, but there is still time to avoid the catastrophes that most threaten our future. Each of the trends described above – in technology, business, economics and politics – represents a break from the past. Taken together, they add up to genuine and realistic hope that we are finally putting ourselves on a path to solve the climate crisis.

How long will it take? When Martin Luther King Jr. was asked that question during some of the bleakest hours of the U.S. civil rights revolution, he responded, “How long? Not long. Because no lie can live forever. . . . How long? Not long. Because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.”

And so it is today: How long? Not long.

60,60,FL-2014-000080-CHN,Indias paranoid economic history: A war room fights phantom imports! - Firstpost,http://www.firstpost.com/india/indias-paranoid-economic-history-a-war-room-fights-phantom-imports-1569619.html,"Nobody quite remembers when the WAR ROOM was quietly wound down and abandoned. India's ordinary citizens had fought this economic war on their own. No government artillery was needed.

'Exim Policy Opens Floodgates – Industry Told to Pull up Socks,' screamed the staid The Hindu Business Line, in a story datelined 31 March 2001 after commerce and industry minister Murasoli Maran abolished import quotas on the remaining 715 items that were on the list. With India's exit, the number of countries with import quotas had shrunk to three.

Virtually everything of interest to everyday life could now be freely imported: mutton, butter, fresh grapes, black and green tea, coffee (not roasted), coffee or tea makers, sparkling wine, beer made from malt, sherry, wine, whisky, rum and gin, envelopes … even tooth brushes, toy guns, ball point pens, fountain pens, combs, hair slides….

India had been opening up gradually since economic liberalization began, and industry had coped. Yet the fear of Chinese goods 'swamping' the Indian market was so thick one could touch it. ""If China can do it, why not India?"" Maran exhorted. Its exports had grown ten-fold between 1980 and 2000 while India's had merely doubled. ""If we do not improve our competitiveness and cry hoarse for needless protectionism, we will have to content ourselves with a low level of subsistence economy,"" Maran said.

Even though this was in line with India's commitment to the World Trade Organization, such a wholesale abolition was a windfall to the naysayers and anti-globalisers. Maran knew he was easy meat for the Leftists. Optically, he had to do something to appear sympathetic, reassuring and in control. In a dramatic PR gesture he called the monitoring desk a WAR ROOM. Almost as if Maran was telling the country that if the imports became a flood, a threat too hot to handle, he would roll out the artillery and stanch them. So the ""war room"" terminology was attractive and graphic.

""I am calling it a 'war room' because they would have to be watchful and we may have to declare war against surges in imports and dumping,"" Maran told Frontline magazine in an interview.

But the war had already been declared in Parliament where the government was skewered. The opposition parties said the government had let down farmers and small industries. Congress MP Mani Shankar Aiyar compared the war room to Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's cave in the Tora Bora mountain range where he was supposed to have escaped to. ""He has set it up after losing the war,"" Aiyar scorned.

Communist Party members asked whether the government could even raise duties beyond bound rates. Aiyar reminded Maran that on edible oil (of which there was a shortage domestically) he could go up to 300 percent. The Leftist idea of helping the common woman was to sock her in the stomach!

But surprise surprise, the war did not even start. A year after the removal of quotas, imports of the 300 sensitive commodities had risen by only 3 percent from $1.6 billion to $1.76 billion.

To be sure, some traditional industries have gone under – but that is a part of the inevitable ""creative destruction"" that takes place when economic policies are changed on such a scale. The lock makers of Aligarh are struggling, unable to match Chinese prices or quality. The glassware industry of Firozabad has also suffered. At Delhi's Bhagirath Palace wholesale market, one finds Chinese lamp shades instead. Xenophobes lament that even Ganesha idols are imported.

But there are huge gains elsewhere. Maran was quite prescient in another area. He had announced several measures to boost agricultural exports in his 2001 policy. In the last two years, India has exported 40 million tonnes of rice, wheat and maize. This has never happened since Independence—and perhaps not ever in India's recorded history—says Ashok Gulati, former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices. India has become the largest exporter of rice and of beef (buffalo meat). The growth of agri-exports has been much faster than that of manufactured exports, particularly during the past ten years with a sizeable trade surplus which shows that India's agriculture can compete in world markets.

In all this, whatever happened to the grandiosely named WAR ROOM. Nobody quite remembers when it was quietly wound down and abandoned. India's ordinary citizens had fought this economic war on their own. No government artillery was needed.

How I wish the war room had been preserved, as a memorial tomb to India's paranoid economic history!","Fri, 13 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MurasoliMaran380AFP.jpg,"['history', 'india', 'industry', 'importsindia', 'firstpost', 'phantom', 'indias', 'quotas', 'war', 'fights', 'quite', 'imports', 'paranoid', 'maran', 'room', 'economic']", 
61,61,FL-2014-000080-CHN,LED bulbs are getting better – and cheaper - Minneapolis Star Tribune,https://www.startribune.com/led-bulbs-are-getting-better-and-cheaper/263110781/,"LED sticker shock is mostly behind us. When Philips introduced 60-watt equivalent LED light bulbs in 2010, they cost about $40 each. Four years later, the price has fallen to $12 or less and consumers can choose from a light spectrum that ranges from soft white, similar to an incandescent, to bright white, similar to fluorescent.

Prices are still painful initially when compared with a buck a bulb for a 60-watt incandescent, but the energy savings and longevity of an LED can save about $125 per bulb over an incandescent, according to Consumer Reports.

That's allowing consumers to focus less on price and more on function. They can confidently select a 60-watt LED equivalent that is dimmable, flicker-free, and pleasing to the eye. But consumers will also find LED versions of three-ways, 100-watters and fluorescent tubes that weren't on the shelves last year. ""This summer is a good time for consumers to discover LED. There are a lot of new options,"" said Mark Voykovic, light bulb merchant for Home Depot.

Cree Inc. of North Carolina, one of the first manufacturers to sell LED bulbs for less than $10, just released an LED version of a three-way bulb (a 30/60/100-watt replacement) for $22 at Home Depot. The soft-white bulb can't be used in dimmers but is expected to last 23 years, using only between 3 and 18 watts.

""Cree is a reputable, relatively inexpensive brand that gets good reviews,"" said Rob Jackson, an LED specialist at Creative Lighting in St. Paul. ""It's hard to go wrong with them.""

The TorchStar LED bulb is displayed, Tuesday, March 12, 2013 in New York. LED bulbs seem to be the future of home lighting: They save electricity, they‚Äôre durable and they don‚Äôt contain mercury, which compact fluorescents do. But having them pump out white light like any old light bulb is sort of like using a computer as a doorstop. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) ORG XMIT: MIN2013040314594870

Last month Cree also released a Par 38 90-watt outdoor flood ($25) that's a good replacement for any hard-to-access light. ""It lasts a lot longer than the halogen, and it doesn't attract bugs,"" said Voykovic.

Philips just released an LED Slimstyle 60-watt bulb for $10 that weighs half as much as most LED bulbs. Its flat shape makes it ideal for table and floor lamps as well as pendants and sconces, according to the manufacturer.

Cree and Philips have also released LED tubes that replace fluorescents. Philips InstantFit T8 tubes are compatible with rapid-start and programmed-start ballasts but not older magnetic ballasts. ""Fluorescent tubes are very energy-efficient, but the LED versions use only half the energy,"" said Mike Connors, CEO of Bulbs.com.

One problem that LED technology has faced is creating bulbs with enough lumens or brightness. But newer LED versions of 100-watt bulbs have been released that sell for less than $25 and make excellent reading lights. ""The color temperatures and brightness of the bulbs has really come a long way in the past two years. Very good products have gotten even better in the last 12 months,"" Connors said.

But consumers still need to read labels and stick to reliable known brands, said Jackson. ""There are noticeable differences in brightness and coloration among manufacturers,"" he said. Consumers have to read labels for the warm or cold light (2700k is warm yellow; 3,500k or higher is brighter and bluer) and brightness (a higher number of lumens means more light). If a consumer wants a dimmable bulb and the label doesn't say it's dimmable, don't buy it, Jackson advises.

Quality is improving but consumers are noticing differences in brightness and coloration. Consumer Reports gave top ratings to LED bulbs from Cree, Philips, Sylvania, EcoSmart, Feit and Utilitech.","Fri, 13 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://chorus.stimg.co/20670961/LED_BULBS_EMERGENCE_2.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces,"['philips', 'light', 'consumers', 'bulb', 'cheaper', 'led', 'bulbs', 'good', 'released', 'better', 'brightness', 'getting', 'tubes']",

But rather than asking themselves which country is most likely to replace the United States, they ought to be asking themselves whether the concept of global hegemony still applies in our era.

It increasingly seems that the world will no longer have a single superpower, or group of superpowers, that brings order to international politics. Instead, it will have a variety of powers -- including nations, multinational corporations, ideological movements, global crime and terror groups, and human rights organizations -- jockeying with each other, mostly unsuccessfully, to achieve their goals. International politics is transforming from a system anchored in predictable, and relatively constant, principles to a system that is, if not inherently unknowable, far more erratic, unsettled, and devoid of behavioral regularities. In terms of geopolitics, we have moved from an age of order to an age of entropy.

Entropy is a scientific concept that measures disorder: the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder. And disorder is precisely what will characterize the future of international politics. In this leaderless world, threats are much more likely to be cold than hot; danger will come less frequently in the form of shooting wars among great powers than diffuse disagreements over geopolitical, monetary, trade, and environmental issues. Problems and crises will arise more frequently and, when they do, will be resolved less cooperatively.

CREATIVE DESTRUCTION

How did we get here? The shift began in the twentieth century, with the advent of nuclear weapons and the spread of economic globalization, which together have made war among the great powers unthinkable. As many scholars have pointed out, the world has enjoyed the longest period of relative peace in recorded history. The absence of cataclysmic wars among great powers has obviously been a great boon. But it has also come at a real cost. For the past several centuries, wars between the extant power in the international system and the rising challenger or challengers have occurred every hundred years or so, crowning a new leading power, which is responsible for organizing international politics and shouldering the burdens of global leadership.

In crowning new kings, these hegemonic wars also obliterated the old orders, wiping the institutional slate clean so that a new global architecture, better suited to the times, could be built from scratch. The wars were thus a good thing in some sense, because they replenished the international system with new energy in service of world order and lasting peace. In their absence, we no longer have a force of “creative destruction” capable of resetting the world. And just as seas become foul without the blowing of the winds, prolonged peace allows inertia and decay to set in.

Power is already more diffuse than it ever has been. And it is growing more so by the year. The United States remains an important power, but it knows that it no longer towers over all contenders. Plagued by ballooning debt, Washington has narrowed its foreign policy to a few basic objectives. Yet the deterioration of Pax Americana is not due solely to the United States' declining power. It is also a problem of will -- one rooted in fading national resolve to use those power advantages that the United States still enjoys.

Interactions between political actors are also characterized by greater entropy. The digital revolution has allowed information to spread farther than ever before, empowering average citizens, celebrities, corporations, terrorists, religious movements, and shadowy transnational criminal groups. The power these groups can exert, however, is unconventional. They have the power to disrupt, to stop things from happening, but they don’t have the power to enact their own agendas. Twitter, Facebook, and text messaging have allowed citizens to organize massive demonstrations and topple dictatorial governments. But there is little reason to believe that citizens organized via social media are able to institute political changes.

INFORMATION OVERLOAD

Entropy is not only on the rise in the international system. Individuals, too, are experiencing greater personal entropy, as they discover that they are incapable of handling the speed at which digital information is transmitted. Information rains down faster and thicker by the day. Increasingly, modern people may feel, as the psychologist and philosopher William James did in 1899, that an “irremediable flatness is coming over the world.” Flatness here refers to a general sense of banality and loss of meaning. Rather than a heightened sense of stimulation and awareness, information overload produces boredom and alienation. As the economist Herbert A. Simon has explained, a “wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.” This is because in “an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients.”

In that sense, modern society suffers from collective attention deficit disorder. No matter how much we pump up our brains with drugs originally intended to treat Alzheimer’s and narcolepsy or attempt to “train” our brains using Cogmed or Lumosity, we are likely to remain terminally distracted by the flood of digital information from Google, Twitter, e-mail, RSS readers, Netflix, Firefox tabs, and Flickr photostreams. Organizations, too, face this problem. The U.S. National Security Agency alone intercepts and stores nearly two billion separate e-mails, phone calls, and other communications every day. “The complexity of this system defies description,” lamented John R. Vines, a retired U.S. Army general who reviewed the U.S. Defense Department’s intelligence efforts last year. “We consequently can’t effectively assess whether it is making us more safe.”

Having greater quantities of information at our fingertips has not produced greater wisdom. Instead, it has led to information entropy. As the volume of information processed or diffused increases, the information becomes noise. In the digital age, information is routinely distorted, buried in noise, or otherwise impossible to interpret. The result is that people respond to the many contradictory “facts” and “informed opinions” being hurled at them by essentially selecting and interpreting facts in ways that accord with their own personal, idiosyncratic, and often flat-wrong ideas about the world. Knowledge no longer rests on objective information but, rather, on seductive “true enough” facts. Knowledge that is pocked with holes but that seems true enough will continue to hold sway over those who simply want to believe something that feels right.

WELCOME TO PURGATORY

The new world of rising structural and informational entropy means that history can no longer repeat itself. We will not endure the hell brought on by a world war, for example, or by utter economic catastrophe. But this lasting peace won’t be the heaven on earth that one might wish for either. Instead, we are on the cusp of an eternal purgatory. It will be a world full of confusion and instability. The age of entropy will be a time of restless disorder, an aimless but forceful hostility to the status quo -- a hostility that inspires the pervasive use of the dismissive prefixes anti- and post- (as in anti-Western, post-American, postmodern) and the promise to reinvent much or all of the present global order and its associated institutions. But the hope that getting rid of “what is” will by itself spawn something new and workable to take its place is just that, mere hope. In his Delphic interview with Time, former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi put it this way: “The world is now much more difficult than it was during your revolution. It’s even more difficult. The world. More complicated, complex, difficult. It’s a spaghetti-like structure. It’s mixed up.”

None of this is to suggest that we will inhabit a miserable world of endless gloom and doom, that we and future generations are fated to endure wretched lives of perpetual unhappiness. Although we can’t reverse the process of information overload, we can figure out how best to adapt, and maybe even learn how to turn floods of information into useful and reliable knowledge. There are no strategies that can guarantee success. But the focus should be on creating decentralized and self-organizing networks that are capable of responding to rapidly changing environments.

The age of entropy will not be a utopia, but it need not bring us to despair. Disorder does not suppress all that is good in the world. Without great wars, we have enjoyed prosperous and peaceful times. Nor is disorder itself something to fear or loathe. “The struggle itself,” as Albert Camus famously pointed out, “is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy."" Like Sisyphus, we need to embrace the unknowable, to accept our unintelligible world and our futile struggle to come to terms with its incomprehensibility. For better or worse, we have no other choice.","Mon, 16 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn-live.foreignaffairs.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large_1x/public/public-assets/legacy/images/3452862703_342d05493b_o.jpg?itok=j4sfY398,"['world', 'entropy', 'power', 'information', 'united', 'age', 'disorder', 'global', 'system', 'wars', 'international']", 
65,65,FL-2014-000080-CHN,Bill Maher 'Does Not Understand Bible or Faith' Says Christian Leader - Gospel Herald,https://www.gospelherald.com/articles/51644/20140617/bill-maher-does-not-understand-bible-or-faith-says-christian-leader.htm,"The President of Mundelein Seminary recently stated that outspoken atheist talk show host Bill Maher does not understand the Bible or true Christian faith.



Father Robert Barron wrote on Catholic News Agency, ""I don't know what possesses me to watch 'Real Time With Bill Maher,' for Maher is, without a doubt, the most annoying anti-religionist on the scene today. Though his show is purportedly about politics, it almost invariably includes some attack on religion, especially Christianity.""



Barron, who also founded Word on Fire ministry, made his statements to the multiple anti-Christian rants Maher has made on his HBO program, ""Real Time with Bill Maher."" .



On a recent episode of the show, Maher called God a ""psychotic mass murderer"" who ""drowns babies"" as seen with the flood of Noah.



""What kind of tyrant punishes everyone just to get back at the few he's mad at? I mean, besides Chris Christie,"" said Maher.



""You know, conservatives are always going on about how Americans are losing their values and their morality, well maybe it's because you worship a guy who drowns babies.""



Earlier this month, the talk show host asked Christian Coalition founder Ralph Reed why Jesus had to come down to Earth to ""correct His dad"" on Old Testament laws such as stoning of adulterous women to death.



Barron writes that Maher's arguments reveal a lack of understanding concerning the essence of the Biblical idea of faith.



""Faith, rightly understood, does not involve any surrender of one's critical intellectual powers, nor is it tantamount to the acceptance of things on the basis of no evidence. What Bill Maher characterizes as 'faith' is nothing but superstition or credulity or intellectual irresponsibility. It is an ersatz 'knowing' that falls short of the legitimate standards of reason. Real faith is not infra-rational but rather supra-rational, that is to say, not below reason but above reason and inclusive of it,"" Barron wrote.



The Mundelein Seminary President also responded to Maher's allegations that Christianity requires the setting aside of all rational thought and logic.



""God did not dictate the Scriptures word for word to people who received the message dumbly and automatically; rather, God spoke subtly and indirectly, precisely through human agents who employed distinctive literary techniques and who were conditioned by the cultures in which they found themselves and by the audiences they addressed.""



Barron concludes, ""If you are ever tempted to agree with Bill Maher on the nature of faith, I would invite you to read any page of Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, John Henry Newman, C.S. Lewis, or G.K. Chesterton and honestly ask yourself the question, ""Does this sound like someone who has suspended his critical faculties?""



This is not the first time Maher has come under fire due to his anti-Christian comments.



In May 2007 the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights even called for Time Warner, the parent company of HBO, to fire Maher after negative comments he made against the late Rev. Jerry Falwell, founding pastor of the Thomas Road Baptist Church.



However, Kevin Sorbo of the 2014 film ""God's Not Dead"" says responding to Maher is pointless due to the talk show host's extreme hate for Christianity.



""I wonder what happened to him in his lifetime, because the atheists I have met, not all of them are angry. I've got some very good friends who are atheists and they just don't believe, they simply don't believe. We've had great debates about it and things like that,"" Sorbo said in an interview responding to the TV show's remarks that God is a ""murderer.""



""There is no reason to even try to talk to a guy like that because he has so much hate.""

The stylishly attired salesman got excited when she mentioned that she lives in Houston.

""I want to work there!"" the Italian told her. ""I promise you, I'm going to find my way there. I'll get there somehow.""

Houston, it seems, is officially on the map for luxury shopping.

""It happened so quickly,"" said Payne, a former fashion model and now a homebuilder. ""But the luxury industry has decided to invest in Houston.""

The Bayou City may not be on par with places like New York or Los Angeles in that regard, but it's on the way, said Howard Davidowitz, chairman of Davidowitz & Associates, a national retail consulting and investment banking firm. He called the city an ""explosive"" area for luxury retail growth, fueled by its strong economy and status as an international hub.

At the city's epicenter for high-dollar shopping, the Galleria continues to expand its stable of upscale boutiques with iconic names like Louis Vuitton, Versace and Bulgari - elegantly furnished stores where handbags are displayed like museum pieces and the clientele hails from around the world.

Meanwhile, high-end options are spreading. Another luxury-focused center is coming next spring. The mixed-use development River Oaks District will feature Cartier, Dior, Hermes, Tom Ford and possibly other high-end retail.

""Houston is rising and high-end retailers are expanding, and the two forces are converging,"" said Ed Wulfe, chairman and CEO of retail development and brokerage firm Wulfe & Co.

The luxury retail market is expected to grow by 4 percent to 6 percent in the U.S. this year, and Wulfe expects the rate to be even higher in Houston.

Another indicator of Houston's growing stature in the luxury retail world is the increasing number of couture shows coming here, said local high-end shopper Brian Teichman. A few weeks ago, for example, Gucci set up a special couture collection, flown in from Italy, in its Galleria store. Houston was on a list of ""select"" cities, the retailer says.

The Galleria's focus also pays off for its owner, developer Simon Property Group. Lilly Golden, president of Evergreen Commercial Realty, said the Houston icon generates higher sales per square foot than any other mall in the Simon portfolio. Simon has an ownership interest in 156 malls and a total of 300 retail centers.

""The Galleria is one of our most diverse and fastest growing luxury destinations,"" said Vicki Hanor, executive vice president of leasing at Simon Malls.

The Galleria does $1.3 billion in annual sales and is one of the best performing centers in the world, she said, ""and many of our luxury retailers have their No. 1 stores in their portfolio at the Galleria.""

The mall is undergoing a renovation that will increase the size of its Saks Fifth Avenue flagship , convert the current Saks space into a 110,000 square foot luxury retail wing and add a standalone building nicknamed ""the luxury jewel box"" with even more high-end retail.

Hublot arrived at the Galleria last fall, joining the likes of Prada, Louis Vuitton, Jimmy Choo, Chanel, Versace, Gucci and Saint Laurent. Coming soon will be John Varvatos, Rolex, Tod's and Tourbillon.

Bulgari, which sells high-end jewelry, watches, accessories and leather goods, has three U.S. flagship stores, in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, but its recently renovated Houston store is ""right there, too"" in terms of its financial performance, said Alberto Festa, the company's president of U.S. operations.

He said Bulgari's Houston business is driven by the energy industry and tourists, including those from Mexico.

International appeal

Galleria shopper Carla Vega flies with family members from her home near Mexico City five or six times a year ""just to shop"" at the mall, she said during a recent outing. A number of the stores she frequents have no locations near her home.

""It's comfortable,"" Vega added. Her family stays at a Galleria hotel and drops off purchases in their rooms.

Shopper Ghada Al-Subaey, who lives in Qatar, strolled the luxury wing of the Galleria with four other women, some toting Neiman Marcus bags. One of them has been getting treatment at the Texas Medical Center from more than a year, Al-Subaey said, and the women have been shopping at the Galleria two or three times a week during their Houston stay.

International flights bring many shoppers to town. In 2012, more than 250,000 Mexicans visited Houston and spent more than $211 million, the state travel research shows.

But Asian tourists also generate a significant amount high-end retail sales, Wulfe said.

Houston Realtor Kenneth Li said direct flights from Beijing, China, and Seoul, South Korea, are helping that number grow. He noted that a high luxury tax in China makes many upscale items relatively less expensive in the U.S.

Luxury retailers tend to locate in clusters, Golden said, which may explain why the Galleria continues to attract more high-end tenants.

Designer fashion store Tootsie's at West Ave is able to thrive outside of the Galleria/Uptown area because it is such a large scale operation and a homegrown brand, Golden said.

High-end retailers have established themselves in The Woodlands and other places.

""Luxury retailers are attracted to Houston due to its unprecedented growth and thriving economy,"" said Gregory Wattson, managing director of development at OliverMcMillan, developer of the River Oaks District planned on Westheimer near the West Loop.

""Houston is the largest and most diverse city in the nation with a population that recognizes global luxury brands,"" he said. "" ... Add tourism from around the world and particularly Latin America and it emerges as a prime target.""

River Oaks District

The 15-acre River Oaks District will have individualized storefronts with modern designs, a collection of restaurants featuring a dining terrace under a canopy of live oaks, wide sidewalks and curbside parking. It will feature 252,000 square feet of retail, 92,000 square feet of office space and 279 residential units. An upscale iPic theater also has been announced.

Wattson said the next release of tenant names ""will further reinforce the attraction of Houston to global retailers.""

River Oaks District could be going for the same feel as the successful Bal Harbour Shops, an outdoor shopping center in a wealthy part of Miami, Golden said.

Simon's Hanor said Galleria customers enjoy being in an air-conditioned mall.

Some like driving there in style, as indicated by the success of exceptionally big-ticket luxury items in Houston.

""We're all lucky to be living and working in Houston and Texas,"" said Don Pierce, chief operating officer of Ferrari Maserati of Houston near the Galleria.

""For a lot of people, a Ferrari is an aspirational goal, and the Houston market is such that a lot of people are achieving their dreams,"" he said.

In years past, Pierce said, the dealership was more likely to appeal to the same customer base. ""Now, our client mix is a lot more diverse, in nationality and profession.""

A new custom-built Ferrari costs between $210,000 and $360,000, he said. Pre-owned cars go for $85,000 to $250,000.

But Pierce did note that Ferrari Maserati of Houston sells more Maseratis, which list for $75,000 to $165,000.","Sat, 14 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.hdnux.com/photos/27/66/25/6251900/13/rawImage.jpg,"['oaks', 'galleria', 'stores', 'store', 'wulfe', 'houston', 'luxury', 'houstons', 'shoppers', 'higher', 'afar', 'retailers', 'homegrown', 'push', 'highend', 'retail']", 
68,68,FL-2014-000080-CHN,Banks: Credit Card Breach at PF Chang's – Krebs on Security - Krebs on Security,https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/06/banks-credit-card-breach-at-p-f-changs/,"Nationwide chain P.F. Chang’s China Bistro said today that it is investigating claims of a data breach involving credit and debit card data reportedly stolen from restaurant locations nationwide.

On June 9, thousands of newly-stolen credit and debit cards went up for sale on rescator[dot]so, an underground store best known for selling tens of millions of cards stolen in the Target breach. Several banks contacted by KrebsOnSecurity said they acquired from this new batch multiple cards that were previously issued to customers, and found that all had been used at P.F. Chang’s locations between the beginning of March 2014 and May 19, 2014.

Contacted about the banks’ claims, the Scottsdale, Arizona-based restaurant chain said it has not yet been able to confirm a card breach, but that the company “has been in communications with law enforcement authorities and banks to investigate the source.”

“P.F. Chang’s takes these matters very seriously and is currently investigating the situation, working with the authorities to learn more,” the company said in an emailed statement. “We will provide an update as soon as we have additional information.”

A spokesperson for the U.S. Secret Service, which typically investigates breaches involving counterfeit credit and debit cards, declined to comment.

It is unclear how many P.F. Chang’s locations may have been impacted. According to the company’s Wikipedia entry, as of January 2012 there were approximately 204 P.F. Chang’s restaurants in the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Chile and the Middle East. Banks contacted for this story reported cards apparently stolen from PFC locations in Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Nevada and North Carolina.

The new batch of stolen cards, dubbed “Ronald Reagan” by the card shop’s owner, is the first major glut of cards released for sale on the fraud shop since March 2014, when curators of the crime store advertised the sale of some 282,000 cards stolen from nationwide beauty store chain Sally Beauty.

The items for sale are not cards, per se, but instead data copied from the magnetic stripe on the backs of credit cards. Armed with this information, thieves can re-encode the data onto new plastic and then use the counterfeit cards to buy high-priced items at big box stores, goods that can be quickly resold for cash (think iPads and gift cards, for example).

The most common way that thieves steal this type of card data is by hacking into cash registers at retail locations and planting malicious software that surreptitiously records mag stripe data when cards are swiped through the machines. The breaches at Target, Neiman Marcus, Michaels and Sally Beauty all were powered by malware that thieves planted on point-of-sale systems.

Unlike with the Target and Sally Beauty batches, however, the advertisement on Rescator’s shop for cards sold under the Ronald Reagan batch does not list the total number of cards that are for sale currently. Instead, it appears to list just the first 100 pages of results, at approximately 50 cards per page. The cards range in price from $18 to $140 per card. Many factors can influence the price of an individual card, such as whether the card is a Visa or American Express card; similarly, Platinum and Business cards tend to fetch far higher prices than Classic and Standard cards.

The ad for the Ronald Reagan batch of cards also includes guidance for potential customers who wish to fund their accounts via Western Union or MoneyGram wire transfers, advice that strongly suggests those involved in this apparent heist are once again from Russia and Eastern Europe:

“Western Union transfers will be received in the next 48-72 hours! Money Gram transfers will be received 10-11 of June. Please note: 12, 13, 14, 15 of June are the government holidays in the drops country and Money Gram transfers will be received starting Monday June 16th. This does NOT affect Western Union transfers.”

June 12 is “Russia Day,” a national holiday in Russia since 1992 that celebrates the declaration of state sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic on June 12, 1990. “Drops” refers to individuals hired to receive money transfers on behalf of the card shop to help fund new and existing accounts. The shop also accepts payment via Bitcoin (for hopefully obvious reasons, customers cannot pay for the goods using credit cards).

It seems likely that P.F. Chang’s only learned of this breach very recently. The cards sold under the Ronald Reagan base are advertised at “100 percent valid,” meaning that fraudsters can expect all of the cards they purchase to have not yet been canceled by the issuing banks. For a deeper dive on how valid rates are a fairly reliable indicator of the recency of a breach, see my analysis of the valid rates on cards stolen in the Target, Sally Beauty and Harbor Freight break-ins.

For more information on Rescator, the miscreant apparently responsible for selling (if not also stealing) the cards from this apparent breach, and in the Sally Beauty and Target breaches, see this story.

Update, June 13, 10:27 a.m. ET: P.F. Chang’s just confirmed that it had a breach, and that it has temporarily moved to taking carbon copies of customer credit cards at all locations. See this story for more information.","Tue, 10 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pfchangs-285x286.png,"['pf', 'changs', 'transfers', 'breach', 'credit', 'stolen', 'security', 'card', 'locations', 'krebs', 'banks', 'cards', 'data']", 
69,69,FL-2014-000080-CHN,How did it come to this? - The Economist,https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2014/06/19/how-did-it-come-to-this,"The crisis in Iraq has roots going far back in history. But recently the folly of interfering outsiders and sectarian leaders within has made matters a lot worse

TENSION had long been mounting in Sunni-majority parts of Iraq. When it broke on June 10th, violence spread with the force of a flash flood in the desert. Within 48 hours of seizing Mosul, Iraq’s second-biggest city, Sunni rebels had barrelled down a 200-mile stretch of the Tigris river valley, scattering troops loyal to Iraq’s Shia-dominated central government and threatening Baghdad, the capital.

The surge was spearheaded by a fearsomely brutal, al-Qaeda-inspired group, the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS), but it was bolstered by a range of other armed Sunnis and was backed by many ordinary citizens. It has wrested the Sunni quadrant in the north and west of Iraq from government control. And it has driven a Sunni wedge between the Shia-majority south of the country and the autonomous region of Kurdistan in the north and east (see article). All but a wisp of the line of around 1,000km (621 miles) that separates the Kurds from the rest of Iraq now abuts rebel-held or -infested territory.

Baghdad itself is unlikely to fall any time soon. The insurgents, numbering at most tens of thousands and armed with light weapons, are wary of grappling with a city of 7m people, most of them, as in Iraq as a whole, Shias viscerally opposed to the rebels. Besides, despite chilling calls by ISIS for the slaughter of Shias, most of its more numerous allies within Iraq say they seek not conquest but either autonomy for Sunnis or a fairer share of power in a united Iraq. They also fear a full-blown return to the grisly sectarian warfare that erupted in 2006-07, when scores of thousands died and at least a million fled their homes.

Iraq’s poorly led but far larger and more heavily armed government forces may eventually roll back the Sunni advance. For now they man a ragged defensive arc around the northern and western approaches to Baghdad that is 60-90km deep. Skirmishing has been continuous here in recent days, from Falluja and Ramadi in the west to Samarra in the north and Baquba in the north-east. The fall of Falluja, an often-troubled city of some 200,000, to Sunni rebels last December should have sounded much wider alarm. The army’s inability to dislodge the insurgents suggests that progress will be difficult.

How did Iraq, a country the world has happily ignored since American troops departed in 2011, come to such a pass? The signs of an accelerating slide have been obvious for months, though the rot goes back further. Some still blame the drawing of “wrong” colonial borders nearly a century ago. Others say the Americans, whose invasion in 2003 was, ironically, excused in part by empty claims of al-Qaeda penetration, wrecked what was left of Iraq’s administrative and social fabric after the sadistic rule of Saddam Hussein. Fingers often also point at Saudi Arabia and Iran, whose rivalry has helped stoke sectarian mayhem in Syria as well as Iraq, and poisons Sunni-Shia relations more widely.

Yet Iraqis themselves bear much blame. The historically dominant but minority Sunnis have never acknowledged their reduced status or indeed their numerical inferiority since Saddam Hussein’s fall. They let resistance to America’s intrusion morph into a brutal, religiously bigoted movement. They turned their noses up at Iraq’s new democracy and squabbled endlessly, failing to unite behind credible leaders, so encouraging the now Shia-dominated establishment in Baghdad to rule over them with bribes, threats and thuggery.

Iraq’s Shias, for their part, have largely flocked behind rabble-rousing, unscrupulous politicians. Those men, including the prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki, during his eight years in office, have done little to build sound or just institutions. Instead they have played political games, packing offices with cronies and siphoning cash from the oil geysers that Iraq sits on top of. This system of spoils has signally failed to lessen the misery of most Iraqis.

In response to the admittedly egregious and constant provocation of attacks by Sunni terrorists, Shia leaders have countenanced or sponsored vicious militias bent on vengeance, some armed and financed by Iran. Mr Maliki himself has repeatedly displayed a paranoid sectarian streak. Ignoring American pleas, he failed to support the Sahwa, or Awakening, a 100,000-strong Sunni tribal force that in 2007-08 helped stanch civil war by hounding terrorists, including the progenitors of ISIS. With little heed to Sunni feeling, he arrested not only prominent Sunnis on flimsy charges of terrorism, but thousands of ordinary folk. “The army was here to control, not protect us,” says Ahmed Hisham, a 22-year-old student from Mosul.

Mr Maliki not only brushed off Sunni protests that have festered for more than two years. In April 2013 his troops shot at least 50 protesters dead at a peaceful sit-in in the Sunni city of Hawija. Rather than reach out after the capture of Falluja by angry rebels, he sent his army to shell the city and helicopters to dump barrel-bombs, even as Iranian-backed militias openly recruited and dispatched Iraqi Shias to fight against Sunnis in Syria.

Mr Maliki has been equally unsubtle in trying to keep the Kurds in check. Repeatedly he has withheld the region’s share of the federal budget as punishment for Kurdish moves towards greater independence. Baghdad’s control of oil revenue made this tempting, but the payback has now come. In response to pleas for help against ISIS Kurdish leaders have smiled and shrugged.

A débâcle such as Mosul might have toppled a different prime minister. Mr Maliki has instead sought to turn it to his advantage, lashing out at Kurdish and Sunni leaders for purported treachery. Terrified by the renewed spectre of Sunni terrorism, many Shias have grudgingly fallen in behind him, accepting that now is not the time for change at the top. Thousands have also rallied to calls by religious leaders to join the army. For the time being a wary stalemate holds, but the new, precarious balance marks a shift that is portentous. The partial Sunni uprising—for this is how most Iraqis view recent events, rather than as a simple lunge for power by ISIS terrorists—presents multiple challenges.

One of these is presented by ISIS itself, with its ambition to create a medieval-style Islamic state bridging the Sunni parts of both Syria and Iraq. Few among Syria’s Arab Sunni majority of around 70% or the quarter or so of Iraq’s 33m people who are Sunni share that dream. Most Sunnis reject ISIS’s brutality, its imposition of ultra-puritanical Islamic laws, and the fact that perhaps a third of its 12,000-odd fighters is made up of foreigners. In a BBC interview, one Sunni ex-general from Mosul described his fellow rebels as “barbarians”.

But ISIS cannot be taken lightly. The group, which evolved from the most radically jihadist wing of resistance to American occupation, was indeed nearly wiped out by the Sahwa. Helped by Mr Maliki’s obtuse policies, it had bounced back even before its recent windfall in Mosul. The latest ISIS yearbook, a document not unlike a corporate report, details no fewer than 9,540 attacks, including 1,083 assassinations, in Iraq alone last year, not including its operations in Syria.

The other half of the caliphate

The war in Syria, which ISIS joined in late 2012, brought far bigger opportunities than the protection rackets and murder it already excelled at in Iraq. Jihad against the awful regime of President Bashar Assad has attracted a flood of proclaimed holy warriors from across the world, including France and Britain. Cash has gushed from private donors in the Gulf, eager to help what they see as a noble cause, as well as from the ransoming of hostages. For the first time, too, ISIS has secured control of actual territory. It has made the north-central Syrian city of Raqqa a testing ground for its harsh brand of Islamic rule.

But as other Syrian rebels began to notice, Syria’s regime has largely avoided clashing with ISIS, sparking talk of links dating back to Mr Assad’s sponsorship of violent Iraqi resistance to America. The group’s goal of incorporating eastern Syria into a new state may have dovetailed with the Syrian government’s moves to concentrate its overstretched forces in the west, while chasing out floods of Sunni refugees.

As it increasingly dawned that ISIS was less bent on toppling Mr Assad’s regime than in creating one of its own, clashes between the rebels began to erupt. These have now expanded into a separate civil war. On June 17th the Syrian Islamic Council, a group of Sunni clerics that back the mainstream rebels’ cause, formally condemned ISIS as a stooge of Mr Assad.

This internecine bloodying within the ranks of supposed allies in Syria may be one reason that the group redirected its attentions to Iraq, though another factor could have prompted ISIS’s sudden attack earlier this month on Mosul, a city of 2m people. On June 4th Iraqi police are said to have scored a rare coup. In a raid near Mosul they killed a man believed to be the group’s second-ranking leader, capturing a trove of data on ISIS.

Perhaps fearful of new vulnerabilities, the group then seems to have hastily sealed a truce with rival Sunni groups it had been fighting only weeks before. Some sources describe a meeting of Sunni chiefs that included Izzat al-Douri, a vice-president under Saddam Hussein who is thought to lead one of Iraq’s larger underground Sunni rebel networks. Whatever the case, fierce clashes with government forces broke out in Mosul on June 5th—and five days later the city fell. Numerous reports suggest that Iraqi army and police commanders, some of them former Baathists, abandoned their posts, prompting lower ranks to flee. On June 17th Mr Maliki gave credence to such talk, dismissing four of his generals for dereliction of duty.

ISIS is riding high for the moment. The glee may not last. Syria’s regime, perhaps perturbed by ISIS’s success and suddenly keen to portray itself as an ally of the West in the fight against jihadist monsters, has for the first time mounted sustained aerial attacks on the group. In Iraq it is probably a matter of time before rival Sunnis decide that ISIS’s notoriety is bad for their cause.

This may not rescue Mr Maliki, who has pleaded for help from America and Iran. The kind of limited, tactical aid they might supply may not be enough to turn the tide decisively. Mr Maliki faces a stark choice. Either he must plunge his forces into a full-scale war of reconquest, at untold cost in lives. Or he must embrace the remaking of Iraq into a looser, genuinely federal state. But his days as Iraq’s leader may be numbered, as the Americans began hinting heavily that they would give extra military help only if he speedily departed.","Thu, 19 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.economist.com/img/b/595/335/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140621_MAP001_0.jpg,"['iraq', 'mosul', 'mr', 'come', 'sunni', 'sunnis', 'iraqs', 'city', 'rebels', 'maliki', 'isis']",

The discovery adds to the debate about whether humanity’s heavy hand in natural processes warrants the formal declaration of a new epoch of Earth history called the Anthropocene. How else is plastic changing our world? From nest decoration to unlikely fish food, these stories reveal how our widespread use of plastics can have unintended effects.

Trillions of Plastic Pieces May Be Trapped in Arctic Ice

Humans produced nearly 300 million tons of plastic in 2012, but where does it end up? A new study has found plastic debris in a surprising location: trapped in Arctic sea ice. As the ice melts, it could release a flood of floating plastic onto the world.

Glowing Trash May Be Becoming Fish Food

Could glowing microbes be enticing ocean fish to snack on bits of plastic trash? Maybe, say researchers studying the ""plastisphere""—the sea’s millions of tons of drifting synthetic detritus.

Ocean Trash Is a Lifesaver for Insect

Research reveals that the spindly-legged bug Halobates sericeus has begun to lay its eggs on not only bobbing pieces of pumice and other ocean debris but also on floating garbage in the Pacific Ocean. The behavior may be giving the insect an edge in a tough environment—but it may also have negative consequences for the ecosystem as a whole.

Laundry Lint Pollutes the World's Oceans

Lint from washing machines is polluting the world’s oceans. Nearly 2000 polyester fibers can float away, unseen, from a single fleece sweater in one wash cycle. The consequences of this widespread pollution are still hazy, but environmental scientists say the microscopic plastic fibers have the potential to harm marine life.

Nest Garbage Says, 'Keep Out!'

One man’s trash is another bird’s treasure. Researchers have discovered that when black kites adorn their nests with bits of white plastic they find littering the ground, they’re saying, ""Don't mess with me."" These humanmade objects warn off rivals, signaling that the nest owner is willing to put up a fight if challenged for its territory.","Thu, 12 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/sn-albatross.jpg?itok=VyoF3sZy,"['trending', 'ocean', 'widespread', 'world', 'fish', 'trash', 'changing', 'tons', 'say', 'trapped', 'worlds', 'plastic', 'researchers']",

But their secrets of living masonry have remained shrouded from view.

Now, scientists have peered into the heart of such fire-ant rafts and discovered how the individual insects link together to create these remarkably strong yet lightweight structures. Such insight, described in a paper in the Journal of Experimental Biology, may one day help engineers build self-healing buildings and bridges.

The towers, bridges and boats that ants build are remarkable in part because they’re strong and light and they adapt to their surroundings -- and because ants serve as both the construction workers and the raw materials. Ants use their bodies like the beams in a building; instead of screwing or nailing those beams together, they reach out and touch each other.

“It’s like their bodies are covered in Velcro,” said study coauthor David Hu, a mechanical engineer at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Researchers are just beginning to probe the complexity of ants’ architectural designs. A recent study found that ants place their defenseless babies at the bottom of a raft to make it more buoyant overall.

But it’s hard to see the complex internal structure of these rafts when all those ant bodies are blocking the view. The researchers could instead use a CT scanner, which uses X-rays to look through the structure -- but those are medical devices built for human scales, and the ants’ legs are so thin that they can’t really be seen.

Instead, researchers at Georgia Tech managed to capture this complex structure using a micro CT scanner, which is typically used to image the tiny 3-D structure of bones. Scientists put 110 live ants in a beaker, swirled it around so they would start to form tiny rafts, flash-froze them in place and then examined them under the scanner. They did this four times, for a total of 440 ants and a total of 2,640 legs (given that each ant has six limbs).

They found, to their surprise, that a whopping 99% of the 2,640 legs had made a connection -- only 26 remained dangling. These ants sure knew how to get a grip on each other.

“We were surprised at how effective they are at finding links,” Hu said. “We thought oh, maybe half the ants would be linked.”

The scientists also found that the ants made sure to position themselves perpendicularly to their peers because it makes the raft more adaptable, allowing it to expand and contract when needed.

Not all ants were created equal. While most of the ants could have a maximum of five connections, some ants were about three times larger and could support 20 connections. With “more parking spots for little legs,” as Hu put it, their enormous bodies acted as hubs for limbs. These structural nodes, where many beams in a structure converge on a single point, also exist in buildings as key points of strength.

Even though the ants were reaching out to their compatriots, they didn’t hold them close -- they purposely kept them at arms’ length. By creating these big spaces between each connected ant, the insects were effectively making their raft more porous, and thus less dense. So even though an ant’s body is denser than water, the rafts are only a fifth as dense and thus can easily float on the surface.

“In some ways they’re building a whole new kind of material,” Hu said. “The individuals are just ants but how they’re arranged affects its material properties.”

In fact, the structure was indeed quite a bit like bone in that way, Hu said: very porous and light, but still very strong. Scientists have also 3-D-printed artificial bone, and engineers could one day build spaceships with bone-like material.

Hu says they want to explore the structures of much larger ant clumps and towers -- after all, these structures can include 10,000 to 100,000 ants, not just 110 at a time.

Self-healing buildings and ships, able to quickly respond to changes in their environment, may sound like technology from the future -- or just straight out of science fiction.

But “from the ants’ perspective, this is an ancient thing,” Hu said.

72,72,FL-2014-000080-CHN,Joe Biden to 'emphasize' illegal immigration of children to US is against the law - Daily Mail,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2659064/Bit-late-Joe-Biden-emphasize-illegal-immigration-children-US-against-law-not-safe.html,"Bit late for that, Joe: Biden to 'emphasize' that illegal immigration of children to US is against the law and 'not safe'

VP Joe Biden plans to tell Latin American nations' representatives that it's unsafe for minor children to travel hundreds of miles alone to the US

The sudden burst of concern comes as thousands of under-18s have flooded across America's southern border

Just a week ago Biden told a business group that the US economy needs 'an unrelenting stream' of new immigrants

Children nabbed crossing into the United States by Border Patrol agents are being held for mere days before being released to family members

Hardly any of them return for court dates with immigration judges, according to a leader of the Border Patrol agents' union



Vice President Joe Biden will meet with senior representatives of Latin American countries this week to 'emphasize that illegal immigration is not safe' and clear up 'misconceptions' about the U.S.'s policy on child immigration, a senior White House official said Sunday.



The senior official told reporters on a conference call that a visit to Guatemala had been added to Biden's schedule at the last minute so he could meet with representatives of the governments of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to discuss the 'root causes' behind the apparent flood of unaccompanied minors leaving their countries to illegally immigrate to the U.S.

Biden's sudden visit to Guatemala is the Obama administration's latest effort to mitigate criticism that it encouraged thousands of children and teenagers to make the dangerous trek to the U.S. when it announced two years ago that it would stop deporting children of illegal immigrants.

Flood: Don Ray, the Executive Director of the Texas Border Sheriffs Coalition compared the situation to the displacement of people following Hurricane Katrina

Sickness: Thousands of children have been transported to Nogales, Arizona, and have reportedly become sickened by the food they have been given at the shelter

Young faces: The pictures, taken recently, show just how many of the illegal immigrants are children -- many of whom have no supervising adult. Up to 400 a day are pouring over the border

The vice president, however, has attracted his own share of eye-rolls with recent comments about immigration.

On June 10 he told an audience at the National Association of Manufacturers that the U.S. economy needs a 'constant, unrelenting stream' of immigrants to continue coming across the border.

'Not dribbling,' he insisted. 'Significant flows.'



Obama's 2012 policy shift wasn't meant to apply to the children now crossing the border illegally.



But 33,000 unaccompanied minors have made the hazardous trip from Mexico to Texas since October,thinking they would be able to stay in the United States once they arrived.



'We are seeing hundreds turning themselves in daily. And I mean hundreds at a time,' Chris Cabrera, a chapter leader of the National Border Patrol Council, told CNN last week.

'They know that once they get to the station, we are going to give them paperwork and we are going to set them free into the United States,' he said.

The Christian Science Monitor says the Obama administration estimates that roughly 80,000 illegal immigrant children will seek safe haven in the U.S. this year.

Twelve times as many kids are coming north illegally this year as the year before president Obama instituted the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.



Cheek-by-jowl: The immigrants are crammed in tiny rooms and forced to sleep on the floor with aluminium blankets as their only comfort

Conspiracy: An association of former border guards has accused the government of deliberately 'orchestrating' the flood of minors for 'political reasons'

'The recent surge of children and teenagers from Central America showing up at our southern border is an administration-made disaster,' Virginia GOP Rep. Bob Goodlatte, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, recently told Fox News.



'Word has gotten out around the world about President Obama's lax immigration enforcement policies and it has encouraged more individuals to come to the United States illegally,' Goodlatte said in a statement.

A report last week found that many of the children being held in U.S. detention facilities had not bathed in days and were sleeping on plastic boards because holding facilities didn't have enough mattresses to go around.

Leaked photos from one base that were obtained by Breitbart News show hundreds of children holed up in crowded concrete rooms, sleeping on the bare floor without blankets or pillows.

'Most of the time, they're getting released to relatives in the U.S.' Cabrera told CNN. 'There's nowhere to put them, so they're released on their own recognizance and have a pending court date.'

'I'd say between 95 and 97 per cent of adults or youths don't show up for court.'

Vice President Joe Biden will meet with senior representatives of Latin America countries this week to 'emphasize that illegal immigration is not safe' and clear up 'misconceptions' about the U.S.'s policy on child immigration, a senior White House official said Sunday

President Barack Obama has called the influx of unaccompanied minors into the U.S. an urgent humanitarian situation requiring a unified and coordinated federal response' and has announced an 'interagency Unified Coordination Group to ensure unity of effort across the executive branch in responding to the humanitarian aspects of this situation' to be headed up by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson.

Now, the president has commissioned Biden to travel overseas to have 'intensive consultations' with the governments of the children's home countries.

During his meetings Biden will talk with government officials from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras about how the U.S. wants to work together 'to try to make life better for these families and children in all of the countries of Central America,' a senior administration official said.



Biden is also expected to speak publicly about the issue, but the Obama administration official could offer no other details on when and where that might happen.

73,73,FL-2014-000080-CHN,Postcard from ... Tresco - Financial Times,https://www.ft.com/content/68a3bc42-ed8b-11e3-8a1e-00144feabdc0,"Artist Anthony Garratt springs on to the wall above the small harbour, gazes down at his artwork lying on the honey-coloured sand, and sighs. “It’s too sunny, too optimistic, I need to free it up.” Minutes later, his soft-focus depiction of a neighbouring island is overlaid with fresh splatters, dribbles and slashes of paint: an expressionist weather front exploding out of the canvas.

This week Garratt completed his fourth huge landscape, each displayed outdoors, where it was created over a two-week period; together they transform Tresco into a sort of giant al fresco gallery. One of five inhabited islands in the 150-strong archipelago of the Isles of Scilly, 28 miles west of Cornwall, Tresco will exhibit the art works, kissed by sun, flecked by sea spray and caressed by Atlantic wind, until late September.

The Bristol-based artist’s three other acrylic and oil paintings will adorn a pristine beach, an inland hill gazing towards outlying islands, and Tresco’s botanical gem, the Abbey Garden. As well as reaching a wider audience than in a gallery, he believes the exhibition in the unsanitised great outdoors will provide “far more immersive, thought-provoking” viewing.

“By exhibiting the paintings in the place they were painted, island visitors will each have their own personal experience with the creations,” he says. “The painting’s appearance will change as the light and weather shifts around them.”

To ensure his al fresco display can withstand the island’s potentially dramatic Atlantic fronts, the artist employed an architect, structural engineer and two shipbuilders to produce the sturdy steel easels supporting each work. Each of the 2.5m by 2m paintings has been treated with a protective varnish.

The unique exhibits are the latest chapter in Tresco’s rich artistic history. Creative figures have long drawn inspiration from the small island’s extraordinary diversity, from its wild craggy north, rolling central meadows and dazzling southern beaches, alongside the Abbey Garden’s Mediterranean flora.

“Painters also get addicted to its incredibly clear, constantly changing light,” says 34-year-old Garratt.

Yet it’s still surprising to find so many acclaimed works of British art from the late 19th and 20th centuries dotted liberally throughout Tresco’s restaurants, public spaces and rental cottages. The Tresco Art Collection, driven by the passion of the island’s owner Robert Dorrien-Smith and his wife Lucy, started with artists connected to the region, and also embraces works of colourful flora. Since the early 1990s they have offered residencies to up-and-coming artists, including Garratt, who exhibit their works in the small but respected Gallery Tresco.

“We don’t advertise ourselves as an art destination,” says Dorrien-Smith as we sit in his office underneath a painting by Ivon Hitchens. “Guests gradually absorb the message. It’s very gratifying when they appreciate Tresco’s art and write to me about works they’ve seen here.”

I don’t need to travel far to start absorbing. My seafront rental cottage sports a delicate pastel-hued beach scene by Rose Hilton, and a five-minute cycle ride reveals a superb display at Tresco’s Flying Boat Restaurant, including paintings by Alfred Wallis, Graham Sutherland and Harold Harvey, alongside those of Sir Terry Frost and Dame Laura Knight.

A short ferry ride takes me to Bryher island where the Dorrien-Smiths bought and redeveloped Hell Bay Hotel as another showcase for the collection, including works by Ivon Hitchens, Dame Barbara Hepworth, Sir Matthew Smith, Patrick Heron, Roger Hilton, Hugo Grenville and Richard Pearce.

But perhaps the most memorable location is back on Tresco in the Abbey Garden. Among the Australian fountain palms, South African protea and Californian cypress are Tom Leaper’s shiny balancing cube, and David Wynne’s two sculptures “Tresco Children” and “Gaia”, the latter carved out of marble given to him by Beatle George Harrison.

They will soon be joined, albeit temporarily, by Garratt’s latest landscape. The painter hopes it will be the first of many exhibitions of works shown in situ around the UK, and is already developing the idea of an exhibition rising from London’s muddy Thames shoreline. “I’d also like to do one in Cornwall’s Eden Project, which you stumble across in the foliage. I have too many ideas, not enough time.”

House Republicans elected Rep. Steve Scalise (La.) majority whip on Thursday, adding a red-state conservative voice to the upper leadership ranks.

Scalise, 48, defeated Reps. Peter Roskam (Ill.) and Marlin Stutzman (Ind.) in a secret ballot election to take the spot vacated by Rep. Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), who was earlier elected to become the next majority leader.

The victory makes Scalise the chief enforcer for GOP leadership; he will be responsible for whipping votes and corralling a conference that has often failed to unify on major votes.

The unusual June leadership elections were necessitated by the surprise primary loss of Majority Leader Eric Cantor Eric Ivan CantorVirginia GOP candidates for governor gear up for convention Cantor: 'Level of craziness' in Washington has increased 'on both sides' White House says bills are bipartisan even if GOP doesn't vote for them MORE (Va.), who will step aside from his leadership post on July 31.

First elected to the House in 2008, Scalise used his chairmanship of the conservative Republican Study Committee (RSC) as a springboard to the party leadership. In challenging Roskam, who was McCarthy’s chief deputy, Scalise premised his candidacy on the desire of conservatives to install a Republican from a red state within a leadership team dominated by members from states that President Obama carried in the last two presidential elections.

Yet his coalition extended far beyond the South and included support from the conference’s highest-ranking woman, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers Cathy McMorris RodgersRepublicans seek vindication amid reemergence of Wuhan lab theory Five takeaways from new CDC guidance on going maskless GOP votes to replace Cheney with Stefanik after backing from Trump MORE (Wash.); as well as Rep. Fred Upton (Mich.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee; and Rep. Tom Cole (Okla.), a leadership ally.

Roskam, a mild-mannered fourth-term successor to Rep. Henry Hyde (R) representing suburban Chicago, struggled to overcome questions about his conservative bona bides and ties to the party establishment. While he had been preparing for the race for years, he suffered from the conference’s desire to alter the status quo after Cantor’s loss, particularly after it became clear McCarthy had the votes to replace the Virginian.

Stutzman was the late entrant and wild card in the race. He drew support from ardent conservatives wary of Scalise's leadership ties and his work with Democrats on a flood insurance deal that many on the right opposed as fiscally irresponsible.

Scalise was seen as the leadership’s choice to lead the RSC after 2012, and he argued while wooing members that he would both bring a conservative voice to the top ranks and could bring conservatives votes along for leadership proposals.

While McCarthy appeared to have his victory in hand early, the whip’s race became a frenzy in the closing days, as the candidates worked the phones and went from delegation to delegation in search of votes. Scalise won essential support from the Pennsylvania delegation after the state’s Republicans interviewed all three candidates.

The contenders also made their case during an official candidate forum Wednesday morning.

The race was thought to be close, but House Republicans announce only the winner of their leadership elections, not the vote tallies.

Ganesh Godiyal, president of Badri Kedar Temple Committee, has said that the ASI should adopt a “transparent and efficient” approach and make “good use of government money”.

“I asked ASI about the claim it has made about spending Rs 35 lakh on restoration work so far. I got a reply from its Dehradun circle mentioning a list of 18 to 20 items on which the expenditure was incurred. They have also taken credit for cleaning the temple premises, which is false. The cleaning work was done by the temple committee,” Mr. Godiyal told PTI.

“We are not satisfied with the way ASI has worked. They have just installed the temple door which is also not of good quality. I have forwarded their reply to temple officer Anil Sharma to verify their claims. After his report, we will decide on our future course of action,” he said.

ASI was handed the responsibility of restoring the temple which was badly affected by the devastating floods and landslides last June in Uttarakhand in which over 5,700 people were presumed dead by the state government.

But the temple committee is not satisfied with the way ASI has worked. According to Mr. Godiyal, the committee does not want to create any controversy but expects ASI to be transparent and efficient in its work.

“We don’t want to create an issue out of it. We just want ASI to work transparently and with more efficiency. They should make good use of government money. What have they done in last one year?” he asked.

“They have not even started work to rebuild Ishaan temple which was washed away in the floods. Re-installation of the stones, which were dislodged, is also pending. They have done nothing to solve the problem of water leakage from the roof of the temple. The problem persists during rains,” he said.

However, dismissing Mr. Godiyal’s allegations, Atul Bhargava, superintendent archaeologist of ASI’s Dehradun circle said, “We got only one month for the work so far. In that time we have installed the door and cleared the platform. Apart from that, our team did scientific cleaning some 8ft to 9ft inside the temple. After that, the doors of the temple were closed.

“We have resumed work from June 6 and are cleaning the remaining portion of the temple’s interior. We have also started carving on dislodged stones from the eastern side. The Ishaan temple is not our responsibility as it was completely washed away in the flood. I don’t understand the reason for their dissatisfaction.”","Mon, 16 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article11300145.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16IN_LPN_KEDARNATH,"['asi', 'restoration', 'kedarnath', 'good', 'temple', 'work', 'mr', 'worked', 'cleaning', 'floods', 'godiyal', 'committee', 'unhappy']",

The Lord of the Rings author wrote the letter on 17 January 1964 in response to Anne Mountfield, a newly qualified teacher who was working at Eltham Green School in London. Mountfield had written to Tolkien that her ""rather restless"" class had been spellbound when she read them The Hobbit. Tolkien typed her a reply, saying that the story of Bilbo Baggins's adventures ""seems to go down well at school"".

He then added a handwritten note to the bottom of the letter, telling Mountfield that ""All teaching is exhausting, and depressing and one is seldom comforted by knowing when one has had some effect. I wish I could now tell some of mine (of long ago) how I remember them and things they said, though I was (only, as it appeared) looking out of the window or giggling at my neighbour"".

Tolkien was Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University, and would mark School Certificate exams in the summers to add to his salary. In a letter to WH Auden, he wrote: ""All I remember about the start of The Hobbit is sitting correcting School Certificate papers in the everlasting weariness of that annual task forced on impecunious academics with children. On the blank leaf I scrawled: 'In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.' I did not and do not know why.""

Mountfield said she had forgotten about her own letter from the author until it fell out of a copy of Tolkien's book Tree and Leaf last year, shortly after she herself had received a letter from a former pupil about the influence she had been on him. ""I like to attribute the coincidence to a little touch of Gandalf magic,"" she said. ""How right Tolkien was that teachers are seldom 'comforted by knowing that one has had some effect' and how very nice when, 50 years after the event, it happens.""

77,77,FL-2014-000080-CHN,Food for thought - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/Food/food-for-thought/article6104452.ece,"Software architect Rayson Rappai found his true calling in organic farming

I’m at the farm, planting china vengayam and manjal. Can I call you back?” asks Rayson Rappai, 45. He does, after sunset and a day of hard work behind him. “My wife Nimmy and I planted about 60 kg of onion. Feels good,” says the founder of OTR Organic Farm Products, Saibaba Colony.

Rayson lived every middle class Indian’s dream. He studied well and migrated to the U.S. in 1999. During the week, he was a Microsoft architect. In the weekends, Rayson, Nimmy and kids Rohith and Rhea hit the orchards of North Carolina. They visited local markets and hand-plucked vegetables at farms. A local grape farmer even wanted to adopt Rayson!

The fruit-and vegetable-laden farms reminded Rayson of his family’s lush kitchen garden in Coimbatore. The couple returned to India in 2007 and Rayson decided to become a farmer. He started off planting cauliflower, greens and thattaipayir in the plot adjacent to his house. He trawled the Net for a working farm, and found one in Puthur near Thondamuthur. “It’s ironical. I came back from the U.S. to buy a farm from a person who was migrating to the U.S.!”

The farm was semi-organic, and Rayson continued that way for two months, till an incident changed his mind. “Workers would spray pesticides and head straight to the toilet. They had severe stomach upsets. When I passed by the area being sprayed, I would have a lingering headache. What was happening was wrong. And, I was determined to set things right,” he says.

Rayson read up on pesticide-free cultivation, learnt about farming techniques from his uncle Baby, an organic farmer himself, and decided to go natural. He raises fenugreek, thandu keerai, mulai keerai, arakeerai, sirukeerai, mint, coriander, dill... He started a store to stock produce from his farm and other nearby organic farms. Today, locals in Saibaba Colony head there to pick up grocery, greens, fruits and vegetables. Monday is D-day, when greens (20 varieties), lemon, amla, brinjals and mullangi arrive from his farm.

There’s a queue in front of the store, and two cash tills operate that day. “The crowd can get difficult to manage. But, it adds to your responsibility to provide only organic stuff,” he says. Rayson chooses his suppliers carefully, whetting them based on certification and references. “There’s a lot of inorganic stuff masquerading as organic. We have to be careful.”

Rayson’s farm is home to many fruit-bearing trees — guava, chicku, rose apples, pomegranate, mangoes. Herbal plants such as thoodhuvaalai and kuppaimeni abound too.

“I restrict myself to raising a few varieties of vegetables. One person cannot cultivate everything. And, if you sell only what you produce you cheat others of a livelihood,” he says. He interacts with other farmers, so that there is no duplication. “I don’t plant banana. I leave that to another who is an expert in it,” he explains.

At work in the farm are both technology and traditional wisdom. “We avoid flood irrigation and plant on raised beds,” he explains. He is also particular about running an ‘orderly’ farm. “Everyone wonders if I am creating software here or running a farm,” he laughs. “But, I like to do things scientifically, and with discipline.” He’s also pursuing a degree in Farm Technology from TNAU.

Rayson visits the farm every day, either on his scooter or car, and brings back the day’s produce. “The farm is where my life lies. For me, happiness is the thought that I cultivate food, and that someone depends on me for nourishment,” says Rayson, packing half a kg of sundaikkai for a customer. “He called yesterday. It took me some time to pluck it. It won’t earn me a lot of money. But, that customer will cook something healthy. That’s what drives me.”","Wed, 11 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article11296355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/_OTR_ORGANIC_FARMS,"['vegetables', 'produce', 'greens', 'thought', 'rayson', 'farms', 'work', 'farmer', 'day', 'organic', 'farm', 'food']",

Sugg, known online as Zoella, started her YouTube channel and her blog in 2009, covering beauty and fashion, but also issues such as anxiety, self-esteem, and cyber-bullying. She now has 4.9 million YouTube subscribers, 1.6 million Twitter followers and two million Instagram followers.

Penguin announced on Tuesday that it had bought two novels from Sugg, who it said had won ""a legion of teenage fans across the globe"" with her ""girl-next-door personality"". American and Canadian rights in the books were sold in 24 hours to Atria Books.

Sugg's first novel, Girl Online, is ""a modern-day Notting Hill for teens"", according to Penguin, in which ""an ordinary 15-year-old girl's relationship with an American pop star goes viral as her anonymous blog is exposed to the world"".

""I had no idea Girl Online would take off the way it has – I can't believe I now have 5,432 followers, thanks so much! – and the thought of opening up to you all about this is terrifying, but here goes … "" writes heroine Penny, who blogs under the alias GirlOnline, tackling ""school dramas, boys, her mad, whirlwind family – and the panic attacks she's suffered from lately"" as well as the moment she falls in love with ""the gorgeous, guitar-strumming Noah"".

The book will be published this November. Amy McCulloch, editorial director of Penguin Children's, said that Sugg ""has an incredible voice for teens and she drew on her wealth of experience dealing with real issues like anxiety and cyber-bullying to deliver a poignant, romantic and heart-warming debut novel"".

Sugg said she had had her ""nose in a book"" ever since she learned to read, and that when she was 14, she ""had my mind set on the fact that I would one day write my own book, something that other people would love to read"".

""I then started writing my blog in 2009 and would never have imagined it would bring me the opportunity to make my teenage dream come true,"" she added.

Sugg's agent, Dominic Smales at Gleam Futures, said that ""social talent like Zoe will be an important cultural influence in the future"". Her deal follows one for Anna Todd, whose fan fiction about the band One Direction garnered 800m reads on the website Wattpad, landing her a book deal with Simon & Schuster earlier this month.","Tue, 17 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/17/1402999463888/Zoe-Suggs-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a09b00118608f030959a3fff73f82b03,"['twobook', 'million', 'book', 'suggs', 'deal', 'zoe', 'teenage', 'penguin', 'novels', 'online', 'blog', 'sugg', 'youtube', 'teens', 'success', 'wins']",

Squatting on the concrete floor of Thailand's Aranyaprathet immigration police station yesterday, Chea Chieng mulled her options.

A day earlier, she had “surrendered” to soldiers in Hua Hin province, saying she had no papers and was prepared to be deported back to Cambodia amid mounting fears of a junta-led crackdown on illegal migrants.

“Some other workers who had passports warned me that even though I speak Thai, they would crack down,” said Chieng, who was employed at a restaurant in Hua Hin, a popular tourist destination for both Thais and foreigners. “We had no choice, so we surrendered to the soldiers.”

After turning herself in, Chieng waited for hours before being loaded onto a truck with some 60 other arrested and “surrendered” workers at about 2am. The trip to Sa Keao on the battered, caged truck took nearly seven hours, and it would be another hour before a similar caged immigration police truck brought her across the border. But none of it – not the junta, nor the uncomfortable journeys, nor the chaotic scene – has diminished her resolve to return.

“Yes, I want to go back,” she said emphatically. “When we return to our homelands, we have no job to do.”

More than 160,000 undocumented Cambodian workers have poured over the border back to their home country in less than two weeks. The Thai junta has repeatedly insisted it has no policy in place to eject illegal migrants and has since begun imploring them to stay, but at least a fraction of those coming through have been arrested in coordinated military raids. The bulk, however, have indeed come of their own accord – often called home by fearful relatives as fears of military brutality spread.

Like Chieng, in spite of the rumors driving them home, many view their return as only temporary.

“Right now, since the Thai government bans it, I can't stay. But if they allow it or reduce the forces, I'll go back,” said Chhak Roeun, a construction worker who had been employed in Chonburi.

Roeun spoke on Monday, shortly after crossing the border into Poipet with her five-year-old daughter. Her two eldest children and husband were expected to arrive a week later and Roeun said she has no idea what any of them would do for income while they are back in Cambodia.

“I have no rice field, I have no farm, so I need to go to Thailand to work.”

The Cambodian government estimates that 300,000 to 400,000 illegal Cambodian workers are employed in Thailand where relatively high wages have made potentially risky work a worthwhile gamble. In contrast to the low pay and insufficient work in Cambodia, the salaries they can earn in Thailand often support entire families back home. Hundreds of millions of dollars are sent back to Cambodia in remittances each year, and the money remains the main source of income for many families.

Sien Ou arrived in Cambodia with his wife and baby daughter on Monday afternoon after spending nine hours in a police truck crammed with dozens of other people. The experience, they said, had done little to deter either from returning.

“We’ve come here, let Thailand get organized and calm down and then we will go back – but legally,” he said.

“He has a passport but no stamp,” explained Ou's wife Chhi Nal, as she fed the baby orange juice a relief worker had handed to them. “I have neither.”

Promises of return may come as relief to both the Thai and Cambodian governments, whose economies are highly dependent on maintaining the status quo. In recent days, the Cambodian government has gone into overdrive; setting up vocational training centers and taking note of the phone numbers of returnees who might be interested in the job market. But creating employment opportunities is a lengthy process, one unlikely to be solved by emergency measures.

Thailand, meanwhile, will doubtless face growing internal pressure from businesses should the exodus continue. The junta, too, has spent the past few days trying to clean up the mess – issuing an order yesterday saying it has “no policy to accelerate arrests and crackdowns of foreign workers” and working with the Cambodian embassy to staunch the exodus.

But at least some appear to have lost their appetite for Thailand.

Phan Lieng, 19, worked as a waitress for just two months before being arrested by Thai soldiers in Hua Hin. Though the job paid far better than farm work, 250 baht (US$7.70) a day, Lieng said she had soured on Thailand.

“Before, I wanted to come again. But when I was arrested, I stopped wanting that.”","Wed, 18 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ucanews.com/uploads/2014/06/1403071111.jpg,"['thai', 'border', 'cambodia', 'exodus', 'desire', 'chieng', 'does', 'work', 'thailand', 'little', 'curb', 'cambodian', 'workers', 'truck', 'come', 'arrested']",

Sanitation remains the most off-track of all the MDGs: 2.5 billion people still lack access to improved sanitation. Photo by: Kibae Park / United Nations / CC BY-NC-ND

The U.N. Open Working Group on the Sustainable Development Goals is holding this week its 12th and penultimate meeting in New York. Thirty representatives from U.N. member states are discussing amendments to the so-called “zero draft” document, which they will submit to the 68th U.N. General Assembly in September as a formal SDG proposal document.

But as many water and sanitation NGOs — including the 270-member End Water Poverty campaign coalition and a group of some 300 NGOs that have submitted a co-signed letter — believe, and as U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Human Right to Water and Sanitation Catarina de Albuquerque has noted, there remains a glaring omission in the document: the human right to water and sanitation.

In its current guise, the document’s preamble fails to mention the human right to water and sanitation alongside other named rights. And while prior meetings suggested human rights would be “mainstreamed” into the SDGs themselves, it remains unclear what this means when the targets and indicators do not fully reflect the standards of the human right to water and sanitation, or the principles of human rights generally.

Last week, the Women’s Major Group submitted edits to the document, suggesting that the human rights standards of “sufficient” and “acceptable” be included among water and sanitation targets and indicators. The organization said: “It is not acceptable to step lower than the existing U.N. resolution on the human right to water and sanitation from 2010.”

""The human rights to water and sanitation guide us in ensuring access to safe, affordable, available, accessible and acceptable water and sanitation for all without discrimination, while progressively eliminating inequalities in achieving universal access,” De Albuquerque said on Tuesday. “The formulation of the SDGs presents an unprecedented opportunity to reaffirm explicitly the human rights to water and sanitation as being indivisible from, and interrelated to, all other human rights.""

What is clear is that some states oppose a human rights framework for the water and sanitation SDG. China and Kazakhstan broke cover in the last OWG session to say water and sanitation should be addressed through an “access” rather than a right-based approach.

End Water Poverty joined many other NGOs in rejoicing at the inclusion of a standalone goal on water and sanitation. However, in aiming for policy that will make universal access to water and sanitation a reality, we must transcend the simplistic access approach in favor of the human rights framework.

As is now well understood, the MDGs are marked by failures that must not be repeated. Water and sanitation is an instructive sector in this regard. While the water MDG has been achieved well ahead of the 2015 deadline — thanks largely to advances in China and India — sanitation remains the most off-track of all the MDGs: 2.5 billion people still lack access to improved sanitation, while it is estimated that at current rates of progress, it will take at least until 2030 for sub-Saharan Africa to meet the water MDG, and more than 150 years to reach the sanitation target.

Inequality is at the heart of these failures, which stem from not prioritizing the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable. As the U.N. Special Rapporteur has already observed, it’s imperative that the MDG approach is reworked to combat inequality by ensuring a focus on the needs of the poorest and most marginalized — one route to doing so would be creating a target of eliminating open defecation. As Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International, warned last week: “The United Nations must not allow the same mistakes to repeat themselves over the next fifteen years.”

Universal access to water and sanitation is a desired outcome. But to move away from the MDG failures, it’s critical that we talk about the processes needed to achieve outcomes, which will overcome the inequalities that inhibit universal access, demand the participation of people and ensure accountability. We must also engage more thoroughly on the standards of what we are lobbying for universal access to. Here, the human right outlines not only a requirement of access, but goes beyond that to include affordability, acceptability, availability and quality.

Crucially — although one could be forgiven for thinking otherwise — this is a framework that in the case of the human right to water and sanitation is referenced explicitly and implicitly in numerous treaties and conventions, reaching back to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights through to the U.N. General Assembly’s 2010 resolution on the human right to water and sanitation — which ratified existing international law as interpreted by U.N. treaty bodies — the 2012 Rio+20 outcome document, and a 2013 U.N. Human Rights Council Resolution, to name but a few.

The full adoption of the human rights framework for the SDGs will be costly and labor-intensive for all involved. Ensuring participation for the marginalized in planning water and sanitation projects, guaranteeing access to information and accountability, and ensuring that access to water and sanitation is affordable and acceptable to everyone, all raise significant challenges to states in particular, NGOs involved in service provision, and of course for private companies and states ensuring regulation of companies enforces adoption of these human rights standards and principles.

This may be daunting, but in policy discussions where “transformative change” and “no more business-as-usual” have become near clichés, member states should now transform rhetoric into reality. And this, after all, is not asking for anything new. The hundreds of organizations from across the world that join the U.N. Special Rapporteur in calling for the full inclusion of the human right to water and sanitation are merely asking for states to keep the promises they have already made.

82,82,FL-2014-000080-CHN,'Hey Dude' cast reunites for 25th anniversary - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2014/06/11/showbiz/hey-dude-reunion-25th-anniversary/index.html,"(CNN) -- In the summer of 1989, Nickelodeon debuted its first scripted sitcom, which followed an Arizona dude ranch owner and the teens he employed for the summer. A lovably goofy concept even then, ""Hey Dude"" ran for 65 episodes and ultimately helped define Nick's programming for the next 25 years. It's since become a cult classic that would find new life on the Internet and on DVD, with reruns still getting airtime.

Cast and crew members of the beloved comedy reunited in honor of the show's 25th anniversary in Austin, Texas, for the third annual ATX Television Festival. It marked the first time the group had sat down together since the show wrapped filming in 1991. The ""Hey Dude"" gang sat down with both fans and reporters for an afternoon of questions, anecdotes and memories.

David Lascher, who portrayed lovable troublemaker Ted McGriff, said he was taken aback when he saw his cast mates.

""It's so nice to see everybody. It's just a flood of amazing memories,"" he says. ""Everyone looks great, seems happy. I can't believe it's been so long.""

Christine Taylor, who played bubbly girl-next-door Melody Hanson, said her kids played in the same gym class as Lascher's at one point, but it has been difficult to keep in contact with everyone.

""Some of us did stay in touch, but it was back in the day when we all left, and we didn't have e-mail addresses,"" she says. ""If you moved and you weren't responsible with your address book, you lost touch.""

Series writer Alan Goodman went on to write and produce 1990s Nick hits ""Clarissa Explains It All"" and ""The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo,"" and opens up about why ""Hey Dude"" remains close to the hearts of everyone involved.

""None of us had any experience at all before this,"" Goodman said, ""so it's something we all do remember fondly.""

Taylor said some memories of the show's aesthetics continue to make her cringe -- especially when it comes to the wardrobe.

""I don't even think that was cool then! I don't remember pleated khaki shorts belted with a shirt and a bolero being cool -- even for people who lived on a dude ranch,"" she says.

But Debrah Kalman, who co-starred as ranch mother figure Lucy, said she took some of the costumes home after the show wrapped and wears them to this day.

The youngest star, Josh Tygiel, got the role of the skateboarding Buddy after responding to an open call notice in a local Tucson newspaper. Tygiel lived at home during the show's filming, but as Taylor recalls, the rest of the cast were in much closer quarters.

""Being away from home, we bonded very quickly. We were at the Ramada Inn, and then we upgraded to the Radisson Suites.""

There were two major absences from the reunion: Kelly Brown, who portrayed strong-minded rich girl Brad Taylor, and Joe Torres, who played the easy-going Danny. Brown had to pull out at the last minute due to a family emergency -- and no one in the group is still in contact with Torres or clued in to his whereabouts.

""We don't really know,"" Goodman said. ""We just know the same rumors that everybody else knows that reads the Internet. There was a rumor he died, there was a rumor he was selling cars in New Jersey, but I don't know if anybody has confirmed any of these things. He's been hard to find.""

Taylor and Torres visited the former Bar None Dude Ranch set in Tucson together a year or two after the show wrapped. Although not as run-down as it appears in a recently uploaded fan visit, Taylor said it was depressing nonetheless.

""It was really sad. It was all still standing, but it just all looked decrepit. Pieces were taken, everything was stripped down.""

The cast members now have children of their own, and have had a variety of experiences introducing ""Hey Dude"" to a new generation.

""A few years ago, somebody contacted me and said they're rerunning all the episodes, so I DVR'd them for my children,"" says Lascher. ""My oldest, who was probably like 8 at the time, really loved it. She totally was into it!""

It wasn't quite the same positive reaction for Jonathan Galkin, who joined the show as series regular Jake Decker in Season 3.

""I bought the DVDs and showed them to my children, but their eyes glazed over,"" recalls Galkin. ""They did not think it was funny.""

The cast and crew are mostly in agreement a reboot of the series doesn't sound like a good idea, with or without the original characters. For Taylor, ""Hey Dude"" worked so well in part because of the time it aired.

""Nowadays, a reboot would be so different. There's something very simple about the show,"" she says. ""It was just these kids on a dude ranch navigating their way through these simple issues. I don't think it would be cool to see Brad and Melody texting each other or Instagram-ing each other!""

Show writer Lisa Melamed says ""Hey Dude"" is still the most asked-about credit on her résumé, despite later work on critical favorites like ""Party of Five"" and ""Sisters.""

""I've actually had people come up to me over the last few years ... and say things like, 'You shaped my childhood.' It's an amazing thing to hear!""

Of all the times people have recognized her from the show, Taylor said, one instance stands out.

""The year I was marrying my husband [actor/director Ben Stiller], we're at a party, and this sort of L.A., blonde type comes up to me and says, 'Oh my god! Melody from ""Hey Dude"".' And I said, 'Oh my god, you know ""Hey Dude""?' And she said, 'Yeah. I'm Paris Hilton.' And that was the first time I met Paris Hilton.""

Cebreros said Singaporean authorities should penalize the blogger concerned. “At the very least, what he said was rather foolish but the fact that it is stirring negative reactions from Filipinos and other minorities in Singapore should convince the authorities to push for tough legal actions,” he added. “It is a black and white case of hate speech and hate mongering that deserves to be condemned and penalized,” he added.

85,85,FL-2014-000080-CHN,Alan Bennett launches fierce attack on private education - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/17/alan-bennett-attack-private-education-lecture-wrong,"Alan Bennett has blasted the private school education system in a hard-hitting lecture in which he argues that ""to educate not according to ability, but according to the social situation of the parents, is both wrong and a waste"".

Bennett, who was educated at a grammar school in Leeds, told an audience at Cambridge University: ""Private education is not fair. Those who provide it know it. Those who pay for it know it. Those who have to sacrifice in order to purchase it know it. And those who receive it know it, or should. And if their education ends without it dawning on them, then that education has been wasted.

""My objection to private education is simply put. It is not fair. And to say that nothing is fair is not an answer. Governments, even this one, exist to make the nation's circumstances more fair, but no government, whatever its complexion, has dared to tackle private education.""

Bennett said that he had never ""been particularly leftwing"", but that he was ""happy never to have trod that dreary safari from left to right which generally comes with age, a trip writers in particular seem drawn to, Amis, Osborne, Larkin, Iris Murdoch all ending up at the spectrum's crusty and cliched end"".

""If I haven't, it's partly due to circumstances,"" his lecture, printed in the 19 June issue of the London Review of Books, said. ""There has been so little that has happened to England since the 1980s that I have been happy about or felt able to endorse. One has only had to stand still to become a radical.""

Telling his audience: ""It would be unsurprising if you were to discount these forthright opinions as the rantings of an old man,"" Bennett, who is 80 – ""an age that entitles one to be listened to, though not necessarily heeded"" – , did not suggest that public schools should be abolished, but that there should be ""a gradual reform"", beginning ""with the amalgamation of state and public schools at sixth-form level"". This, he said, ""ought to be feasible and hardly revolutionary if the will is there. And that, of course, is the problem.""

Private education is not only unfair, according to the playwright: he also suggested it was ""not Christian either"". ""Souls, after all, are equal in the sight of God and thus deserving of what these days is called a level playing field. This is certainly not the case in education and never has been, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't go on trying. Isn't it time we made a proper start?"" he asked.

Bennett himself was offered a place at Sidney Sussex college, Cambridge, after he sat the scholarship exam in history, on a weekend when he first came across ""public schoolboys in the mass"", and ""was appalled"". The History Boys, one of his best-known plays, follows a group of grammar-school boys preparing for Oxbridge entrance exams.

The author studied at Exeter College, Oxford, where he joined the Oxford Revue before first becoming famous as a member of Beyond the Fringe with fellow Oxbridge graduates Dudley Moore, Peter Cook and Jonathan Miller.

In his LRB article Bennett compares the present ""stealth[y] dismantl[ing]"" of the welfare state to the dissolution of the monasteries, ""with profit taking precedence over any other consideration, and the perpetrators today as locked into their ideology and convinced of their own rightness as any of the devout louts who, four and five hundred years ago, stove in the windows and scratched out the faces of the saints as a passport to heaven"".","Tue, 17 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/17/1403004089535/Alan-Bennett-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f112328ee63890dd21e51e12f59e3dba,"['know', 'according', 'education', 'private', 'attack', 'launches', 'bennett', 'fair', 'alan', 'school', 'fierce', 'schools', 'public', 'state']", 
86,86,FL-2014-000080-CHN,"Cleaning the Ganga, step by step - The Hindu",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/cleaning-the-ganga-step-by-step/article6105068.ece,"The task of reducing the pollution load of the Ganga is daunting, but the clamour for a cleaner river has gained momentum in recent times

Traversing over 2,500 km, from the Gangotri glacier in the Himalayas to the Sunderbans delta in Bangladesh, the Ganga is used by hundreds of millions of people. This is one of the few river basins in India that is rich in water resources but highly polluted. How did one of the world’s mightiest rivers end up as a garbage dump?

Issues affecting the river are myriad and complex. Untreated sewage and industrial waste are dumped into the waters without remorse. Reduced flow and rampant underground water withdrawals affect millions of people who depend on the river’s water. Further, floods and droughts, which endanger lives and cause serious damage to crops, livestock and infrastructure, are a common phenomenon in the river basin. A changing climate will pose more challenges. The combination of glacial retreat, decreasing ice mass, early snowmelt and increased winter stream flow will add to the pressure. There is now clear evidence that climate change is already affecting the Himalayan ice cover. This will have a profound impact on the river.

However, all is not lost yet. Recent initiatives by the Indian government such as including ‘River Development’ and ‘Ganga Rejuvenation’ to the portfolio of the Minister of Water Resources, and the establishment of the National Ganga River Basin Authority and the National Mission for Clean Ganga, show a commitment to address some of these pressing concerns with special attention given to pollution control.

Even though the task of cleaning the Ganga is a daunting one, significant strides can be made toward achieving this.

The Ganges is a complex transboundary basin which flows across different jurisdictions. Therefore, a basin-scale approach would help manage the water resources better. This would require close coordination with all the countries sharing the Ganga, such as Nepal and Bangladesh, so that the interests of both upstream and downstream users are taken into consideration. The existing treaties on “sharing water resources” could be renegotiated as “shared management of water resources.”

Second, the Ganga is highly polluted. Yet, of the 400 million people living along the banks of the river, many still rely on its natural systems for their livelihoods. According to a World Bank report, a number of government efforts (Ganga Action Plan: Phases I and II) have attempted to address the pollution problem, but the results have been disappointing so far. It is estimated that sewage constitutes the largest portion (80 per cent) of the pollution load followed by pollution caused by industrial discharge agricultural activities. With agricultural activities intensifying in areas near the river, particularly in urban and peri-urban areas, farmers frequently rely on waste water for irrigation. This poses a serious public health risk. However, this adversity can be turned into an opportunity as urban waste offers a significant nutrient resource for farming, if safely treated and applied. Low cost, simple ecological sanitation and reuse systems will be keys to making waste water treatment feasible for agricultural purposes.

Third, environmental flows are essentially the water requirements of aquatic ecosystems and of basic human, social and spiritual needs. However, the concept of environmental flow only refers to the the quantity of water required to maintain river ecology under different environmental conditions. Deteriorating water quality in the Ganga — due to domestic, industrial and agricultural effluents — is also a major threat to riverine ecosystems and to people whose livelihoods depend on water. Innovative methods for maintaining environmental flows and the quality of water during environmentally critical periods, along with procedures for implementing these methods, need to be investigated.

In cities, towns and industrial estates most vulnerable to flooding in the Ganges river basin, major investments are required to address climate variability. Existing flood forecasts are often too technical and not easy for the public to understand. Application of remote sensing and hydrological modelling has helped in developing high-quality flood maps, which are useful for developing plans for river conservation, maintaining the quality of water in different stretches and, more importantly, reducing the vulnerabilities of the affected communities.

Innovative approaches such as underground taming of floods for irrigation and aquifer management could offer solutions to the flood problem. These approaches essentially involve storing floodwaters in underground structures in upstream areas. This will help prevent floods and help maintain water availability even during dry seasons.

In addition to the steps taken by the government to clean the Ganga, successful implementation of this task would require partnerships with various stakeholders. Multiple agencies working to address the problem could be brought on board. The private sector has also shown its willingness to be a partner in cleaning the river, especially at critical points such as Varanasi. Similarly, the public at large, along with civil society groups, also need to be actively engaged in these efforts.

In recent times, the clamour for a cleaner Ganga has gained momentum. Although huge progress is being made, the need of the hour is to widen our focus. Negotiations on economic revitalisation of the Ganga should involve India, Nepal and Bangladesh. This task in itself is of mammoth proportions. However, by taking small steps, we can still reduce the pollution load and restore the river to the people.

In a blog post Thursday, CEO Elon Musk wrote that Tesla has removed the patents from the wall at the company's Palo Alto headquarters in the spirit of the open source movement.

“Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport. If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal. Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology,” he wrote in the posting.

Musk said Tesla took out the patents because it feared big car companies would copy its technology, but then discovered the traditional motor industry was not moving swiftly into this area.

“At best, the large automakers are producing electric cars with limited range in limited volume. Some produce no zero emission cars at all,” he said.

Musk pointed to the role the electric car could play in addressing the amount of greenhouse gases released into the air, if enough of them were made to replace vehicles that burn fossil fuels.

“Given that annual new vehicle production is approaching 100 million per year and the global fleet is approximately two billion cars, it is impossible for Tesla to build electric cars fast enough to address the carbon crisis,” he said.

“ By the same token, it means the market is enormous. Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world’s factories every day.”

Tesla is maker of the $70,000 US Model S, an electric car that has been widely adopted but ran into problems last year when footage hit YouTube of a Tesla on fire. There were 6,900 Model S cars sold in the first quarter after their release.

The company has released the car in Canada, moved into the U.K. in June and also has plans for China.

Tesla says it wants to encourage talented engineers from around the world to work to improve batteries and other electric car technology.

At the beginning of this year, Tesla had 203 patents covering batteries and other key features. The earliest any of Tesla's current patents expires is 2026, so the Palo Alto, California is relinquishing a potentially valuable long-term advantage.

Stifel analyst James Albertine says the announcement signals Tesla is open to collaboration as it ramps up production. It currently makes one vehicle, the Model S sedan.","Thu, 12 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.cbc.ca/1.1359349.1402598315!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/tesla-model-s.jpg,"['car', 'vehicle', 'puts', 'wrote', 'released', 'model', 'domain', 'tesla', 'patents', 's', 'cars', 'public', 'electric']", 
88,88,FL-2014-000080-CHN,Meet the atheist ... who believes in God - CNN,https://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/06/10/meet-an-atheist-who-believes-in-god/,"Opinion by Frank Schaeffer, special to CNN

(CNN) - All the public debates between celebrity atheists and evangelical pastors are as meaningless as literary awards and Oscar night.

They are meaningless because participants lack the objectivity to admit that our beliefs have less to do with facts than with our personal needs and cultural backgrounds.

The words we use to label ourselves are just as empty.

What exactly is a “believer?” And for that matter what is an “atheist?” Who is the objective observer to define these terms?

Maybe we need a new category other than theism, atheism or agnosticism that takes paradox and unknowing into account.

Take me, I am an atheist who believes in God.

Let me explain.

I believe that life evolved by natural selection. I believe that evolutionary psychology explains away altruism and debunks love, and that brain chemistry undermines the illusion of free will and personhood.

I also believe that a spiritual reality hovering over, in and through me calls me to love, trust and hear the voice of my creator.

It seems to me that there is an offstage and an onstage quality to my existence. I live onstage, but I sense another crew working offstage. Sometimes I hear their voices “singing” in a way that’s as eerily beautiful as the offstage chorus in an opera.

My youngest grandchildren Lucy (5) and Jack (3) are still comfortable with this paradoxical way of seeing reality.

Most grownups don’t have the transparent humility to deal with the fact that unknowing is OK. But Lucy and Jack seem to accept that something may never have happened but can still be true.

For instance they take Bible stories we read at face value, and yet I see a flicker in their eyes that tells me that they already know the stories are not true in the same way boiling water is true and can be tested—it’s hot!

It's like that mind-bending discovery from quantum mechanics that tiny objects like electrons can actually be in two places at once and act simultaneously like a particle and a wave.

Maybe my grandchildren will embrace quantum theory, and won't look for ways to make the irrational rational by hiding behind words like “mystery” in order to sustain their faith in science or God.

Or maybe they'll embrace apophatic theology, the theology of not knowing.

Atheists in the Bible Belt: A survival guide

But it's not the easiest thing to do.

Our brains are not highly evolved enough to reconcile our hunger for both absolute certainty and transcendent, inexplicable experiences.

Nor can I reconcile these ideas: “I know that the only thing that exists is this material universe,” and “I know that my redeemer liveth.”

Depending on the day you ask me, both statements seem true. And I don't think I'm alone in that.

Behold, the six types of atheists

We’re all in the closet, so to speak. We barely come out to ourselves and never completely to others. I have met people who claim a label - evangelical or atheist - until you really get to know them.

Then, things get more complicated.

Many of us, even the devout, have many more questions than answers about God and religion.

In other words, people just like me: atheists who pray and eloquent preachers who secretly harbor doubts.

I believe that we’re all of at least two minds. We play a role and define that role as “me” because labels and membership in a tribe make the world feel a little safer.

When I was raising my children, I pretended to be grownup daddy. But alone with my thoughts, I was still just me. I’m older now, and some younger people may think I know something.

I do: I know how much I can never know.

Many Muslims, Jews, Hindus and Christians inherited their faith because of where they were born. If you are an atheist, you hold those beliefs because of a book or two you read, or who your parents were and the century in which you were born.

Don’t delude yourself: There are no ultimate reasons for anything, just circumstances.

If you want to be sure you have ""the truth"" about yourself and our universe, then prepare to go mad. Or prepare to turn off your brain and cling to some form or other of fundamentalism, whether religious or secular.

You will always be more than one person. You will always embody contradiction.

You—like some sort of quantum mechanicals physics experiment—will always be in two places at once.

One of the most oft-cited reasons for the current glut of big-budget, CG-heavy sequels is that these films do well overseas. But now the tide may be turning, according to a survey conducted by a leading Chinese entertainment research firm.

The group found that grosses for imported films are falling due to “the lack of variety in recent imported films, many of which are sequels and re-releases, and heavily driven by special effects.” Instead, audiences are turning to “diverse and relatable” homegrown movies. If this trend keeps up, who knows — Sequel Bits could become a thing of the past. [TheWrap]

Jurassic World may be taking a page out of the How to Train Your Dragon playbook.

Following Paul Walker‘s death last fall, his brothers Cody and Caleb Walker were called in to help complete his role in James Wan‘s Fast & Furious 7. But it seems Cody’s involvement won’t stop there.

The word is that Cody could play a role in future installments. Paul’s character Brian would retire, while his younger brother would join Dominic Toretto’s crew. We’ll have a better idea of where the story is headed once Fast & Furious 7 opens April 10, 2015. [Daily Mail]

Ghostbusters 3 has suffered a countless stops and starts over the years, but star Ernie Hudson sounds optimistic that it’ll come together for real in the near future. According to him, the long-gestating sequel will shoot either this fall or next spring. While he admits that that schedule could change, he insists the movie is “definitely happening.” [CinemaBlend]

Indeed, as if to emphasise the point, said conference sessions were presented in the wake of another Angry Birds deal that's looking to spawn more than just mobile games, Angry Birds Transformers.

The Finnish developer giant is linking up with Hasbro are to launch a whole range of licensed products based around an Angry Birds and Transformers mash-up, much like the Star Wars deal that came before it.

Merchandise in disguise

""Angry Birds Transformers provides fans worldwide with a fun, new story and characters, and innovative ways, like our TELEPODS platform, for consumers to engage with the brand,” says John Frascotti, CMO at Hasbro.

""We collaborated with Rovio to create opportunities for kids and families to experience Autobirds and Deceptihogs across multiple formats and entertainment platforms, for a completely immersive branded experience.""

As such, smartphone games look like they're on the cards, naturally, but this is also likely to hit the living room consoles, desktop computers and tablets. And that's just the games.

Transformer Telepods

A toy range and other established Angry Birds products are also expected to flood the merchandising highways, including Transformers-branded TELEPODS; small toy figures that can interact, to a small degree, with the touchscreen games.

“We’re really excited to combine the iconic Transformers universe with the quirky world of Angry Birds,” adds Blanca Juti, Chief Marketing Officer of Rovio. “This mash-up is going to appeal to those who grew up with the brand in the 80s, as well as fans of the brand today. People are going to love it!”

(Bloomberg) -- The glut of spare cash in dollar funding markets is combining with inflation concerns to stoke debate among investors about just how soon the Federal Reserve might have to take its foot off the accelerator.Bond traders are keenly attuned to the buildup of dollars in short-term interest-rate markets, an overabundance reflected in the amount of money sitting and earning absolutely nothing at the Fed’s reverse repo facility. For some, that’s yet another sign that the so-called quantitative easing program ought to be dialed back from its current pace of $120 billion a month, although others say that the central bank facility is acting like it should, as a safety valve, and also point to the other factors fueling the oversupply.Either way, the cash pile --and whether the usage of the Fed’s facility resumes its upward trajectory after slipping on Friday -- is set to be a key focus for traders in the coming week along with crucial U.S. jobs data, which may give clues about just how strong growth and inflation really are.“Progress toward achieving the dual mandate should be the biggest factor” driving decisions about policy tightening, said Credit Suisse Group AG strategist Jonathan Cohn, referring to the Fed’s twin goals on employment and consumer prices.The drumbeat of policy makers making noises about when the Fed should debate tempering its asset purchases has been quickening, although officials have been careful to say that their views are premised on the economy continuing to power forward and the prospects for sustained inflation. The strength of the upcoming labor market report is therefore set to be a major catalyst for bets about when both tapering and rate hikes might begin to take place, as will the evolution of funding markets.The next central bank policy meeting will take place June 15-16, while there is talk of possible tapering signals coming out of the Kansas City Fed’s annual gathering at Jackson Hole in August.Money-market traders are currently pricing in about 18 basis points worth of Fed rate hikes by the end of next year -- down around 3 basis points from levels late last month. That equates to around a 72% chance of a standard 25 basis-point increase in 2022. Before they even get to that point though, officials need to get through tapering, and most analysts expect there to be a lag before they embark on pushing interest rates higherAsymmetric RiskThe yield on 10-year notes has drifted slightly lower over the past couple of weeks, although it received some support in recent days from reports about government budget proposals and at around 1.59% is firmly entrenched in the range that it’s been in for a few months. Bond-market inflation expectations, as measured by so-called breakeven rates, have also eased back slightly, although they remain within sight of the decade highs they reached earlier in May.Some traders are wary that the upcoming report on May job creation could reignite the move higher in long-term yields. The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg is for an increase in payrolls of around 671,000 people and a figure of that magnitude or higher could make the prior month’s unexpectedly weak reading seem like a one off. There is also the prospect of a revision to figures for April, which came in at around 266,000 despite earlier predictions for a gain of 1,000,000.“The risks in the market are asymmetric toward higher yields,” said John Briggs, global head of desk strategy at Natwest Markets. “After last month’s payroll figure, economists are being conservative this time, so there’s a chance the actual figure is above consensus.

93,93,FL-2014-000080-CHN,"Kenya is a war zone, warns al-Shabaab after Somali Islamists massacre 48 - The Guardian",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/16/kenya-war-zone-alshabaab-islamist-militants-massacre,"Islamist militants from Somalia have said they carried out an attack on the Kenyan coast that left at least 48 people dead, and warned foreign tourists that the east African country was now ""officially a war zone"".

Gunmen reportedly went door to door in the coastal town of Mpeketoni on Sunday evening, demanding to know if the men inside were Somali-speaking Muslims. Those who were not were shot dead. Among the victims were football fans who had been watching a World Cup match at a video hall. Others were dragged from their homes or some of the town's small hotels.

The brutal separation of Muslims from non-Muslims echoed the assault on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi last September when at least 67 people were killed, some after not being able to answer questions about Islam. The Somali militant group al-Shabaab has previously vowed to carry out terror attacks to avenge Kenyan troops' presence in Somalia.

A statement from al-Shabaab on Monday said the latest attack – the deadliest since Westgate – was revenge for the ""Kenyan government's brutal oppression of Muslims in Kenya through coercion, intimidation and extrajudicial killings of Muslim scholars"".

It also condemned the ""Kenyan military's continued invasion and occupation of our Muslim lands and the massacre of innocent Muslims in Somalia. To the tourists visiting Kenya we say this: Kenya is now officially a war zone and as such any tourists visiting the country do so at their own peril.""

The statement added: ""Foreigners with any regard for their safety and security should stay away from Kenya or suffer the bitter consequences of their folly. You have been forewarned!""

Mpeketoni, a trading centre on the main coastal road, lies on the mainland 20 miles south-west of Lamu island, a popular tourist destination whose ancient architecture is listed as a Unesco world heritage site.

As dawn rose in Mpeketoni on Monday, the Guardian saw at least 10 bodies lying in the streets or next to houses, almost all adult men. Most had been shot, but some had been hacked with knives or other sharp objects.

By late morning, dozens more bloodied corpses had been brought to the town's tiny mortuary, where they lay three to four deep, some burned beyond recognition. Several people were killed in and around the nearby village of Kibaoni.

Witnesses said the attackers – numbering more than 30, many wearing cloths to cover their faces – had stormed into town at about 8.30pm on Sunday in two hijacked minibuses, meeting little resistance from security forces.

They divided into groups, one of which attacked a police station while another attacked banks and business premises. At least two hotels and many vehicles were set on fire during a methodical assault that lasted all night.

John Waweru, who lost two brothers in the attack, said the gunmen spoke Somali and asked his brothers to recite verses from the Qur'an. ""I heard them speaking some Somali to my brothers who live next door,"" he recalled. ""Then I heard a burst of gunfire as they sprayed the house with bullets. I hid myself and went to check on the house after they left and found them shot in the head.""

Another survivor, Anne Gathigi, said the gunmen also spoke Swahili and asked her husband his religion. ""When he said he was a Christian, they just opened fire. They shot him five times in the head and chest.""

At the Breeze View Hotel, the gunmen pulled the men aside and ordered the women to watch as they killed them, saying it was what Kenyan troops were doing to Somali men inside Somalia, a police commander told the Associated Press.

Some of the victims had been watching the World Cup in local bars and hotels. Meshack Kimani told Reuters: ""The attackers were so many and were all armed with guns. They entered the video hall where we were watching a World Cup match and shot indiscriminately at us. They targeted only men but I was lucky. I escaped by hiding behind the door.""

Samuel Gitobu, a motorbike rider, recalled: ""I had just dropped clients at Equity bank when we saw smoke and later heard gunshots. At first I thought it was a robbery but other motorbike riders fled, shouting, 'al-Shabaab!'""

Gitobu said he called a local police officer about the incident but his phone went unanswered. A junior police officer later called him back, telling him that they had also been ambushed.

""One of the police officers told me they were under attack too and could not establish the number of the attackers,"" he added. ""He said the officers would respond after they repulsed the gunmen. But they only came at around 7am to collect bodies lying around the town and surrounding villages.""

Diana Salim was driving passengers in a minivan north from his hometown of Malindi, south of Mpeketoni, when more than 20 heavily armed men stopped his and another vehicle. Speaking from his hospital bed on Lamu, he described how he and the other passengers were ordered into the bush.

""They told us to lie down and started beating us,"" he said. ""When they put a pistol to my head, I shouted out the shahada [the profession of faith in Islam] and they said that I should run away because I was a Muslim.""

After walking for miles, Salim found his way back to the road and managed to hitch a ride to Lamu. He believes that the vehicle he was driving may have been used in the subsequent attack, but did not know what happened to the passengers who remained in the bush.

Kenya's interior minister, Joseph Ole Lenku, said the attackers fled into the nearby wilds, known as the Boni forest, after a ""fierce exchange of fire"" with security forces. A search is under way.

After Sunday's attack, the American ambassador made Kenya's entire coastal region off limits for embassy employees.

Kenyan troops crossed into southern Somalia in 2011 to fight al-Shabaab, later joining the now 22,000-strong African Union force. Since then a series of reprisal terrorist attacks has damaged Kenya's crucial tourist industry. Tour operators evacuated hundreds of British holidaymakers last month from beach resorts near the port city of Mombasa following new warnings from the Foreign Office.

The statement from al-Shabaab added: ""We hereby warn the Kenyan government and its public that as long as you continue to invade our lands and oppress innocent Muslims, such attacks will continue and the prospect of peace and stability in Kenya will be but a distant mirage. Do not ever dream of living peacefully in your lands while your forces kill the innocent in our lands.""","Mon, 16 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/7/1407421226914/9171333_thumb.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a33227cdf73a1a589d03258e60f13b7b,"['kenya', '48', 'kenyan', 'world', 'zone', 'islamists', 'attack', 'somalia', 'alshabaab', 'massacre', 'told', 'war', 'men', 'muslims', 'shot', 'warns', 'somali']", 
94,94,FL-2014-000080-CHN,Vigan City bids one more time for world presence - Inquirer.net,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/612056/vigan-city-bids-one-more-time-for-world-presence,"The last time Vigan in Ilocos Sur province pulsated collectively as a city was before 1999 when it was inscribed in the World Heritage list of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco).

Nearly 15 years later, the same energy gravitates in this heritage city as it mounts its final run to keep its place in the New7Wonders Cities campaign.

The now-familiar campaign brand is printed on mini flags which flutter along Vigan’s heritage houses on Calle Crisologo, considered Vigan’s “Ground Zero.”

Also seen on counters of commercial establishments—from hotels to restaurants—are mini-sign stands bearing the campaign brand and information on how to vote online in the global race.

Currently in the Top 28 list, Vigan remains in the running as the lone Philippine candidate in the global competition initiated by Swiss nonprofit New7Wonders Foundation.

The foundation, which aims to preserve the world’s manmade and natural heritage, is also behind the campaign that named Puerto Princesa City one of the world’s New7Wonders of Nature in 2011.

Mike Escobar, Ilocos Sur provincial information officer, said Vigan’s pitch has taken a different level from the interpersonal approach characteristic of the pre-Unesco inscription era in the early 1990s to social and multimedia platforms in the new media age.

“We have the advantage of the social media. We have taken this platform to flood our audience with promotional materials,” he said.

Escobar said the wonder-city awareness campaign is in stark contrast to the Unesco heritage inscription, which saw most residents and the local government against Vigan’s conservation then.

He said Vigan Mayor Eva Marie Medina has tapped every possible avenue from big conventions, celebrity concerts to national media network-hopping to promote Vigan’s global quest.

“As the lone nominee from the Philippines, let this be a journey where every Filipino shall join hands to bring pride to our country. Let us go beyond the border of our nation to achieve our goal,” Medina said during Vigan’s campaign launch on May 1.

Medina also asked the government to support Vigan’s world bid.

In a letter to Secretary Herminio Coloma of the Presidential Communications Operations Office, Medina cited the Puerto Princesa underground river experience which triggered tourist arrivals, business opportunities and jobs after earning a slot in the New7Wonders of Nature.

“[The inclusion of Puerto Princesa] intensified the entire country’s reputation as a top global destination. It brought forth economic gains to a cross section of Philippine society,” she said.

Vigan Vice Mayor Lourdes Baquiran said the city’s inclusion in the list would inspire other cities and towns to strive and contribute something in uplifting the Philippines’ image to the world.

Since the campaign began in May, however, the city government has no means to monitor how the promotions are converted to actual votes for Vigan.

A statement from the campaign organizers on June 6 and posted on Vigan’s Facebook fan page said “emerging cities such as Vigan, Shenzhen (China) and Quito (Ecuador) have seen improvements.”

“But [they] are by no means in the ‘safe’ zone yet, especially as previous experience indicates changes up to the last minute,” the statement said.

Escobar said Vigan could only rely on the foundation’s monitoring on the 28 countries’ movement in positions.

The finalists will be trimmed down to 21 cities on July 7 and to 14 on Oct. 7. The final Top 7 list will be announced on Dec. 7.

New challenge

Escobar also cited Vigan’s other challenge the moment it captures a slot in the new wonder cities. “Vigan lacks the space to accommodate more tourist facilities,” Escobar said.

He said local investors have turned to either tearing down or converting abandoned houses around the heritage zone to make way for new hotels.

“The core zone (heritage district) remains off limits to conversion. Investors are mindful of this. So they would scout for other sites to build their hotels,” he said.

He said neighboring towns like Bantay, Sta. Catalina and San Vicente also stand to benefit from the wonder city tag.

Local governments should expect to have a full plate as the world, for the second time, takes notice of Vigan’s heritage success story, he said.

Sri Lanka’s parliament on Wednesday voted against a United Nations led probe to investigate alleged atrocities that occurred during the country’s civil war.

The vote comes after the UN Human Rights Council announced last week that it had appointed a 12-member panel to investigate war crimes in the island nation. Sri Lanka was embroiled in a decades-long civil war that ended in 2009 when government forces defeated the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Both sides have been accused of a wide range of rights abuses.

“The investigations should not be carried out on the grounds [that] it disturbs the process of peace and reconciliation in the country,” said Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights Mahinda Samarasinghe. “The UN Human Rights Council action erodes the dignity, sovereignty and stature of the country.”

“We are against any international interference into the country’s internal issues,” he added.

Before the parliament vote, Sri Lanka had already stated that it would not cooperate with the probe. The motion was approved with 144 votes in favor and 10 against in Sri Lanka’s 225-member parliament. However, the motion rejecting the investigation is not binding.

“Irrespective of what the Sri Lankan parliament decides, the investigation will go ahead on the basis of available information and on the basis of testimonies of those...who will come forward,” said Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Center for Policy Alternatives in Colombo.

“Were the findings of the investigation to [show] government culpability in respect of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, it will be left to the individual members of the international community to decide on how best to act upon them,” Saravanamuttu said.

“Sri Lanka could face serious consequences” if the findings are presented at the UN Security Council, he added.

The minority Tamil National Alliance (TNA) was the only party to vote against the motion while the main opposition – the United National Party (UNP) – abstained from the vote. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress also boycotted parliament during the vote.

R. Sampanthan, leader of the TNA, said that the UN investigation could be an opportunity for Tamils to discover the truth about what happened during the final days of the war, and pointed out that it was not a plot against the nation as a whole.

“The investigations are only against perpetrators of human rights [violations],” said Sampanthan.

Sajith Premadas, a UNP parliamentarian, said that if the government were to look into the accusations fairly, there would be no need for an international investigation.

“The government must form a local investigation mechanism to probe ongoing human rights abuses and war crimes,” he said.

The government established its own Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission in 2010. However, it has been widely criticized.

Saravanamuttu said that an internal investigation would be difficult to carry out with any degree of legitimacy.

“The question here is as to whether we can have a credible and independent domestic mechanism given what has happened and is happening to the institutions and processes of governance, especially the judiciary and the rule of law,” Saravanamuttu said.","Thu, 19 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ucanews.com/uploads/2014/06/1403152946.jpg,"['crimes', 'human', 'rights', 'war', 'vote', 'saravanamuttu', 'lanka', 'parliament', 'investigation', 'sri', 'international']",

Doug Nordman, 53, and his wife spent their careers in the U.S. Navy. During their working years, they built robust portfolios and lived frugally, saving over 50% of their incomes at some points. As he prepared to retire from the military, he realized his investments could actually support him, without having to take a civilian job. Today, he and his wife live in Hawaii, where he spends his time surfing and completing do-it-your projects around his home. He’s chronicled his journey to early retirement on his web site, The Military Guide.



Ray Hinchliffe, Jr., now in his late sixties, saw his salary grow from just $67 a week to more than $100,000 a year over the course of his career working at grocery stores, first as a clerk and later as a manager. Through disciplined saving, he built a sizable nest egg under the guidance of his financial advisor. He says one of the best things he did for his finances was purchasing a home as soon as he was able to. Today, he owns multiple properties and enjoys a relaxing retirement.



Retirement

Hinchliffe: I find myself being in a very good position. I now have been retired for over 12 years. I’ve managed to go from $67 a week [in earnings] to [now having] several million dollars.



Nordman: My wife and I are millionaires. We have that much money in our retirement investments, and we plan to make that last the rest of our retirement. We didn’t really want to work until we were in our 60s and do a more traditional retirement age. Instead, we thought we’d be able to retire in our 50s or even our 40s, and as it turned out, it worked out for me to be at age 41.



Earnings

Hinchliffe: In 1959, I started as a food clerk with A&P. I was making $67 a week as a food clerk. After that, I went with Safeway food stores. I worked with them for 30 years. I made over $100,000 a year as a store manager for them, plus bonus, and was able to save quite a bit of money working with them and investing in their plans.



Nordman: I peaked out at about $88,000, and that was just before I retired in 2002. My wife’s salary peaked out at about the same number. As we got older, in our 30s, we realized that we had enough savings that our portfolio, our investments, were growing fast enough to almost replace our incomes.



Saving

Hinchliffe: I found that the best way to save money and easiest way to save money was through my work. Sometimes younger people aren’t disciplined enough to put money away as they should every week or every month, but what I would do is take advantage of 401(k) plans that might be at work, stock plans where they would match your money that you put into buying stock in the company.



Nordman: Our financial freedom came from saving a lot of money, saving a high percentage of our income. My wife and I were both active duty in the Navy for over 20 years and during that time we tried to save as much as we could. Most of the time we’d save over half of our income. We would reduce our expenses and just save the rest in mutual funds. Pretty much the boring mutual funds, index funds, exchange-traded funds that everybody should use for their retirement. Nothing special.



Frugal Habits

Hinchliffe: There’s lots of things that I wanted but not a lot of things that I needed. If you bought a used car, it did the same thing for you [as a new car] and you saved yourself quite a bit over a period of time. Another thing we used to do is vacations, we would go with friends rather than buy a big place and go by ourselves. We would go with other couples and split the bill and that helped out a lot.



Nordman: My wife and I have a lot of frugal habits that I think tended to make us big savers. We planted a lot of the yard with fruit trees, and so we have fruit year-round. We get crops all year here in Hawaii, and so we can grow some of our own fruit. And we also compost and use things around the house. By buying from Craigslist and Goodwill you're effectively recycling possessions that other people don’t want anymore, and you’re getting them for yourself at a much cheaper price than if you bought them new.



Advice

Hinchliffe: My advice to someone young today is to stay on course with their investing aims. It’s like a boat. You set a course. You go from one spot to another. If you get off course, needless to say you don't know where you’re going to end up. If you have a good plan and you follow it, I think that you’ll find that you’ll succeed and your investing will definitely pay you a huge dividend.



Nordman: Track your spending for a couple of months and see where your money goes. Don’t try to cut back, don’t try to change anything just track your expenses and see where you’re spending your money. Then you will figure out where you want to cut back, and you won’t feel like you're depriving yourself or making yourself miserable.
