1,1,FL-2018-000068-CHN,How China censors the net: by making sure there’s too much information - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/16/how-china-censors-internet-information,"One of the axioms of the early internet was an observation made by John Gilmore, a libertarian geek who was one of the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “The internet,” said Gilmore, “interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.” To lay people this was probably unintelligible, but it spoke eloquently to geeks, to whom it meant that the architecture of the network would make it impossible to censor it. A forbidden message would always find a route through to its destination.

Gilmore’s adage became a key part of the techno-utopian creed in the 1980s and early 1990s. It suggested that neither the state nor the corporate world would be able to censor cyberspace. The unmistakable inference was that the internet posed an existential threat to authoritarian regimes, for whom control of information is an essential requirement for holding on to power.

In the analogue world, censorship was relatively straightforward. It merely required state control of all the main communications media – print, radio and television – plus fear of draconian punishment for anyone daring to circumvent the resulting restrictions on information citizens were allowed to see. The 20th century provided numerous instances of how this worked – in fascist dictatorships, the Soviet empire and Mao’s China, for example – and how effective it could be in the pre-digital age.

Although much has changed since those dark days, it remains true that the internet (as distinct from the web) is still very difficult to censor. And yet – despite that – authoritarian regimes are flourishing. How come?

The answer, in a nutshell, is that they have sharpened up their act. In the process, some have displayed remarkable insights into the nature and affordances of network technology, insights that some democratic governments still don’t seem to appreciate. And at the cutting edge of the new approach to censorship that has emerged is – surprise, surprise! – the People’s Republic of China.

In 2015, commenting on the fact that Chinese internet users generated 30bn pieces of information a day, a former director of the country’s state internet information office observed that “it is not possible to apply censorship to this enormous amount of data. Thus censorship is not the correct word choice. But no censorship does not mean no management.”

Note that last sentence. The quote comes from a remarkable new book – Censored: Distraction and Diversion Inside China’s Great Firewall – by Margaret Roberts, one of a number of dedicated scholars who have for some years being studying how the Chinese regime is “managing” the internet. What these scholars have been unearthing is a detailed picture of “networked authoritarianism” (to use the academic Rebecca MacKinnon’s term) in action. Roberts’s book is a magisterial summary of what we have learned so far.

Flooding involves deluging the citizen with a torrent of information, with the aim of making people overwhelmed

In essence, the Chinese approach is a combination of technocratic realism and political nous. It accepts that, in the end, Gilmore’s axiom still applies, but not the techno-utopian conclusion that effective censorship is therefore impossible. It just needs to be updated for a digital age.

Censorship 2.0 is based on the idea that there are three ways of achieving the government’s desire to keep information from the public – fear, friction and flooding. Fear is the traditional, analogue approach. It works, but it’s expensive, intrusive and risks triggering a backlash and/or the “Streisand effect” – when an attempt to hide a piece of information winds up drawing public attention to what you’re trying to hide (after the singer tried to suppress photographs of her Malibu home in 2003).

Friction involves imposing a virtual “tax” (in terms of time, effort or money) on those trying to access censored information. If you’re dedicated or cussed enough you can find the information eventually, but most citizens won’t have the patience, ingenuity or stamina to persevere in the search. Friction is cheap and unobtrusive and enables plausible denial (was the information not available because of a technical glitch or user error?).

Flooding involves deluging the citizen with a torrent of information – some accurate, some phoney, some biased – with the aim of making people overwhelmed. In a digital world, flooding is child’s play: it’s cheap, effective and won’t generate backlash. (En passant, it’s what Russia – and Trump – do.)

In her book, Roberts provides abundant evidence of how the Chinese authorities deploy these three techniques. She also suggests that other authoritarian regimes are now taking lessons from the Beijing playbook. This is significant because there are only two systems of governance left in our world: some version of liberal – or, as in Hungary – illiberal democracy; and the Chinese model of networked authoritarianism. Up to now, we in the west – high on Francis Fukuyama’s “end of history” narrative – have tended to assume that our system would triumph and that digital technology would help make that happen. The Chinese take a different view. And in the end they may have the last laugh.

2,2,FL-2018-000068-CHN,Electrocution Deaths Worry Residents of Flooded Guangdong - Sixth Tone,https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1002445/electrocution-deaths-worry-residents-of-flooded-guangdong,"Following several days of torrential rain in southern China, residents of Guangzhou and neighboring Foshan are concerned that the cities’ power poles and electric bus stop signs may have been responsible for the deaths of at least four citizens.

One of three cases reported over the weekend involved two women — a mother and her daughter — who were electrocuted in Foshan, Guangdong province, on Friday while standing at a bus stop consisting of a large electronic sign with an awning overhead. Both later died at a local hospital. On Saturday, the Chancheng District publicity department confirmed to The Paper, Sixth Tone’s sister publication, that the pair had died of electrocution, and that afterward, power had been cut to all bus stops in flooded areas of the city and inspectors dispatched to prevent further cases of electrocution.

Also on Friday, a 17-year-old boy collapsed while crossing a flooded street in Guangzhou, the provincial capital. According to a coroner’s report viewed by Sixth Tone, the cause of death was electrocution. The boy’s father, surnamed Chang, told The Paper he believes a traffic light’s power box located at ground level was responsible for his son’s death: He provided photos of mud and silt inside the box, indicating that it had been submerged.

A third case, also in Guangzhou, involved an unnamed victim found near an electric pole. The cause of death has not been confirmed.

Despite assurances from government departments that the cases are being handled, netizens are worried, in part because of content circulating on social media. One graphic video posted Saturday on Weibo shows two bodies floating face-down within the flooded enclosure of a bus stop, just below a brightly-lit electronic noticeboard. The user who posted the video said it had been filmed in Guangzhou and advised people to stay away from such equipment because of the risk of electrocution.

When reached on Monday, Guangzhou’s publicity department declined to comment on the cases and suggested that Sixth Tone contact local bus companies, whom it said was in charge of the electronic signs. But a receptionist at Guangzhou Bus, a state-owned enterprise, told Sixth Tone that such spaces are managed and maintained by advertising companies whose names he declined to provide.

The Guangzhou office of China Southern Power Grid, another state-owned enterprise, posted on its Weibo microblog account on Monday that no causalities resulting from any of the power points it manages had occurred during the typhoon period. However, the police of Guangzhou’s Baiyun District wrote on their Weibo account that electrocution had not been ruled out in the 17-year-old’s death. “The exact reason is still being investigated by forensic doctors and experts from local power departments,” the post read.

Multiple calls to China Southern Power Grid’s Guangzhou office went unanswered on Monday.

A 25-year-old office worker who lives in Guangzhou told Sixth Tone that it was “raining cats and dogs” on Friday. Though she had not personally witnessed any casualties from electrocution or drowning, the woman said, videos of such cases had flooded her groups on social app WeChat along with the heavy rain in the city. “The water in the streets didn’t abate until midnight,” she said.

3,3,FL-2018-000068-CHN,Chinese trademark filings flood foreign markets - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-trends/Chinese-trademark-filings-flood-foreign-markets,"TOKYO -- Chinese trademark applications in Japan, the U.S. and Europe swelled nearly sevenfold in the three years through 2017 as government subsidies aimed at building global brands prompted a disruptive deluge of filings.

China can often be an unfriendly place for foreign companies looking to register trademarks -- an essential part of doing business. When a Japanese organization tried in 2009 to trademark Imabari towels, known for their quality, its application was rejected on the grounds that a Chinese company had already trademarked the characters for ""Imabari.""

In some cases, so-called trademark trolls register valuable brand names and the like pre-emptively, then force the companies that actually use the marks to buy or sue for the rights.

At the same time, the Chinese government has encouraged companies to seek trademarks overseas, particularly since last year, when it adopted policies to further its brand trademarking strategy. A similar push in patents has made the country the world's second-largest filer.

China is poised to overtake the U.S. this year as the top source of trademark applications in Japan. The Japan Patent Office reported 8,464 Chinese filings for 2017, up more than fivefold from 2014. Chinese trademark applications filed with the European Union Intellectual Property Office more than quadrupled over the period.

The U.S. received more than 50,000 applications from China in the year through September 2017, accounting for 8.5% of all trademark filings. The eightfold surge from fiscal 2014 lifted China far above such other big filers as the U.K., Canada and Germany.

Chinese businesses that apply for foreign trademarks have been able to receive government subsidies since last year. Such payments in Zhejiang Province amount to half the cost of filing in Europe and the U.S. and 70% in emerging countries, according to local media.

Many of the applications in the U.S. come from small, obscure online retailers apparently just looking to collect the subsidies. The Wall Street Journal notes numerous cases of multiple filings using images of nearly identical products differing only in the brand on the tag.

Though competition for trademarks is far from unique to China, some analysts worry that the subsidies could distort the competitive landscape and disrupt legitimate business activity. The payments may be intended to ""undermine the U.S. trademark system,"" writes Josh Gerben of the Gerben Law Firm, which specializes in trademark issues. The flood of Chinese filings has alarmed the Japan Patent Office as well.

4,4,FL-2018-000068-CHN,"India, China Sign Two MoUs on Sharing of Brahmaputra River Data, Rice Supply - The Wire",https://thewire.in/uncategorised/india-china-sign-two-mous-on-sharing-of-brahmaputra-river-data-rice-supply,"Qingdao: In a significant move, China today agreed to provide India hydrological data of the Brahmaputra River in flood season, months after Beijing stopped the practice, crucial to predict floods.

The two countries also signed an agreement under which China has agreed to import non-Basmati rice from India which is likely to bridge the ballooning trade deficit to a certain extent.

The two Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) were signed after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held detailed discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping on bilateral and global issues which will add further vigour to the India-China friendship after their informal summit in Wuhan.

Modi arrived in the picturesque coastal city of China’s Shandong province on a two-day visit to attend the annual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).

Last year, China had stopped sharing data soon after the 73-day long stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops at Dokalam over Chinese military’s plans to build a road close to India’s Chicken Neck corridor connecting North-Eastern states.

The first MoU was inked between China’s Ministry of Water Resources and India’s Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation upon provision of hydrological information of the Brahmaputra river in flood season by China to India.

The agreement enables China to provide hydrological data in flood season from May 15 to October 15 every year. It also enables the Chinese side to provide hydrological data if water level exceeds mutually agreed level during non-flood season.

China, an upstream country, shares the scientific study of the movement, distribution and quality of water data for the river.

Originating from Tibet, the Brahmaputra is one of the major rivers in China. From Tibet it flows down to India and later enters Bangladesh where it joins the Ganga.

The second MoU was signed between China’s General Administration of Customs and India’s Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare on Phytosanitary requirements for exporting rice from India to China, one of the world’s biggest rice markets.

The 2006 Protocol on Phytosanitary Requirements for Exporting Rice from India to China has been amended to include the export of non-Basmati varieties of rice from India.

At present, India can only export Basmati rice to China.

Sources said the pact on non-Basmati rice may help in addressing India’s concerns over widening trade deficit which has been in China’s favour.

China has been promising to address the issue of trade deficit with India which has been seeking a greater market access for its goods and services in China.

Trade deficit with China stood at USD 36.73 billion during April-October this fiscal.

India’s trade deficit with China has marginally dipped to USD 51 billion in 2016-17 from USD 52.69 billion in the previous fiscal

5,5,FL-2018-000068-CHN,100 Films to Flood Chinese Cinemas From June to August - The Beijinger,https://www.thebeijinger.com/blog/2018/05/29/100-films-flood-chinese-cinemas-during-june-august,"It can be easy for cinephiles to feel underwhelmed by what's on offer at multiplexes on the Mainland. However, we can all rejoice as a recent dry spell is about to end with 100 foreign and domestic films hitting the big screens from June to August, according to a report by China Film News.

The busy season begins in earnest with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom's Jun 15 debut. Other upcoming Hollywood blockbusters will include Mission: Impossible-Fallout, Ant-Man and the Wasp, and Crazy Rich Asians.

If Hollywood hits aren’t your scene, there are also plenty of homegrown films to choose from. Hidden Men (by renowned Chinese director Jiang Wen, who also made a splash stateside a few years back with his role in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) and Detective Dee: The Four Heavenly Kings (by Hong Kong auteur Tsui Hark) will be released on Jul 13 and 27, respectively. Meanwhile, the acclaimed Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou will debut his latest creation, Shadow, this summer (the release date has yet to be set).

The flood of local and foreign films into the Chinese market follows a successful summer season last year when RMB 55.9 billion was grossed at the Mainland box office according to the China Film News report mentioned above, more than triple the 2016 total. China is the world’s second-largest movie market, but at this rate of aggressive progression, it will rival North America’s – the largest in the world- by 2019.

Let’s make the most of the abundance of movies on our shores this summer and take a look at what is worth watching. Here are our top picks:

Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (Jun 15)

This Jurassic World sequel will take you on a journey back to prehistoric times as Owen, played by Chris Pratt, and Claire, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, attempt to rescue dinosaurs on an about-to-erupt volcano on Isla Nublar. We follow Owen as he desperately searches for Blue, his head raptor, in the wild. However, Owen soon discovers a conspiracy that threatens the entire planet. This is not a movie for the faint of heart, seeing as the flick's fresh, new, terrifying roster of dinosaurs will practically leap off the screen.



Detective Dee: The Four Heavenly Kings (Jul 27; filmed in Chinese with English subtitles)

One of China's most successful movie franchises returns with a third installment, Detective Dee: The Four Heavenly Kings, helmed by acclaimed Hong Kong director Tsui Hark. The film's eponymous protagonist, played by Taiwanese heartthrob Mark Chao, is this time forced to multitask as he tries to solve a complex series of mysterious events in Loyang, including the appearance of warriors wearing totem mask, foxes starting to speak Chinese, and palace dragon sculptures turning into real life fire-breathing demons. While solving a flurry of cases, he needs to defend himself against accusations made by his boss Empress Wu Zetian, his most formidable opponent yet.

Incredibles 2 (Jul 27)

What do you think happens when Mr. Incredible, voiced by Craig T. Nelson, is placed on stay-at-home dad duties for the first time? The obvious — he wants out ASAP. But that’s easier said than done, as his wife Elastic Girl becomes the bread-winner and is now the cover girl for superheroes around the world. So, superhero dad has no choice but to rear his three children at home. Jack-Jack, the infant, is the hardest to look after as he is constantly testing his incipient powers, causing trouble at every turn. Disney and Pixar’s kid-friendly superhero sequel is a fun summer movie for young and old alike.

Shadow (release date TBD but rumored to be in August; filmed in Chinese with English subtitles)

Legendary Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou goes back to his roots with this martial arts masterpiece, Shadow, staring China’s cream of the crop actors and actresses including Deng Chao, Zheng Kai, Wang Qianyuan, Guan Xiaotong, and Sun Li. The historical picture set in the Three Kingdoms era (AD 220-280) follows a king, played by Zheng Kai, who plots to win back his homeland for his displaced people. Yes, it’s another Medieval Chinese film, but this one is an artfully crafted masterpiece shot with a Chinese calligraphy ink overcast, providing a unique, refreshing, and timeless watch.

Crazy Rich Asians (release date TBD but rumored to be in August)

It has only taken Hollywood 25 years to releases a movie featuring an all ethnically Asian cast. This hotly buzzed rom-com is based on the bestselling novel Crazy Rich Asians written by Kevin Kwan. The heroine, Rachel Chu, is an American Born Chinese played by Constance Wu (famed for her role on the TV series Fresh Off the Boat). She shares top billing with the super-rich “Bachelor of Singapore,” Nick Young, played by Henry Golding. This love story is an interesting one. It’s about the complications and problems that middle-class Rachel and upper-class Nick face as they journey down the road of marriage. The film gives a beautiful insight into the complex customs, traditions, and beliefs of traditional Chinese families. It'll make you laugh and tug at your heartstrings.

Chinese investors snapped up around $100 billion worth of property around the world in 2016. While most countries normally like to encourage this kind of investment, some are saying they need to put some checks on the strength of foreign investor’s purchasing power in order to prevent real estate bubbles, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Back in 2010, Chinese buyers purchased just $5 billion worth of international property, the Journal noted. However, rising prices for both commercial and residential real estate in cities such as Sydney, Toronto and Vancouver are helping to spark a frenzy among buyers.

Officials from Australia and Canada told the Journal they’re growing increasingly concerned about the rising level of foreign investment, saying it could lead to price bubbles that threaten regional economies. In Vancouver, officials say home prices grew at a rate of 30 percent per month compared to the year before. In order to stem that growth, the city imposed a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers, increasing this to 20 percent last February. In turn that pushed more buyers to Toronto, which responded by introducing its own 15 percent tax on foreign buyers in April 2017.

Meanwhile in British Columbia, officials introduced measures aimed at deterring the resale of condominiums before construction has been completed, and also discouraging the flipping of condos that are yet to be occupied. Victoria, the capital city of British Columbia, has seen exceptionally high demand from Chinese buyers, witnessing a 29 percent spike in sales of one-million-dollar plus homes. According to Christie’s International Real Estate, Victoria was the world’s hottest new housing market in 2017, with the price of single-family homes there soaring to $570,000.

“Victoria is experiencing the same rapid growth in housing prices and sales volumes that have strengthened Toronto and Vancouver in recent years,” according to the Christie’s International survey. “If Toronto and Vancouver can be a measure, it is likely Victoria will continue to perform well despite [new] regulations” that target foreign buyers.

In the U.S., Chinese investors also make up the biggest segment of foreign buyers. They spent a whopping $31.7 billion on residential homes in the U.S. between April 2016 and March 2017, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Chinese investors also dominate foreign investment in Australia’s residential sector, buying around one third of that nation’s available plots, worth some $1.5 billion, in the last year.

Jon Ellis, chief executive officer at Investorist, told the Journal that Chinese buyers are an “unstoppable juggernaut”.

Over in China, the Beijing government has introduced its own measures aimed at preventing capital from leaving the country. New rules state that Chinese citizens can only exchange local currency worth a maximum of $50,000 per year, but loopholes still exist that allow many investors to get around these limits.","Tue, 12 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://realtybiznews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1159.jpg,"['investors', 'chinese', 'vancouver', 'real', 'buyers', 'worth', 'foreign', 'flood', 'toronto', 'victoria', 'journal', 'battle', 'billion', 'cities', 'estate']",

According to Guangdong Meteorological Service Center, the center of the storm passed from the western city of Yunfu, where four died from a rain-induced landslide, to Zhaoqing. Ewiniar is expected to continue moving north with a speed of 10 kilometers per hour today.

Here’s how the storm has affected residents in cities across the province today.

Yunfu

According to CCTV, as of 1.30pm today five have died due to a landslide that buried a home in Taiping county, Yunfu. Rescue efforts are underway, according to the latest update.



Zhaoqing

According to local news, the city is facing emergency situations including flooded roads, overflowing rivers and collapsed streets. All schools are closed, though, as the video above shows, the gaokao is still being held, with firefighting trucks and boats dispatched to help examinees reach testing sites.

Foshan

According to Nanhai News, Foshan has had active typhoon and rainstorm alerts since 5.30am this morning. All schools are closed, although gaokao testing is proceeding as usual. The typhoon is expected to bring more rainfall tomorrow, along with thunder and lightning.

Shenzhen





This morning, the Shenzhen Meteorological Bureau upgraded multiple weather alerts. A white typhoon alert and yellow lightning alert are active for the whole city. Futian, Luohu, Yantian, Longgang and Longhua districts have also been upgraded to an orange rainstorm alert, while others were still yellow as of this morning.

While the typhoon alert is active, residents are suggested to keep a close eye on the latest weather reports and take proper precautions, such as ceasing outdoor activities and avoiding low-lying, flood-prone areas.

The city will be affected by severe rainstorms accompanied by strong winds today, according to a Weibo post by the local weather bureau.

Guangzhou

Guangzhou's Weather Bureau announced that districts including Zengcheng and Conghua have lowered their typhoon alerts to white, while remaining districts are still on blue alert.

A red rainstorm alert was issued this afternoon for Yuexiu, Haizhu, Liwan, Tianhe, Baiyun, and Huadu districts, while Huangpu, Conghua and Zengcheng remain at orange. Panyu, with a yellow rainstorm alert, has the mildest warning.

As of publication time, local schools are for the most part open. Guangzhou Nanfang International School, ISA International School and Utahloy International School of Guangzhou, however, have announced that they will close early today.

Guangzhou Railway has also announced that due to the rain, trains heading north on the following routes will not leave the Guangzhou station after 6pm today: Beijing-Guangzhou, Guangzhou-Foshan-Zhaoqing and Guangzhou-Shenzhen. Instead, the routes will begin at Guangzhou East.

9,9,FL-2018-000068-CHN,China's Giant Ionosphere-Zapping Radar Is a Defense System Masquerading as Science - Popular Mechanics,https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/research/a21272688/china-giant-ionosphere-zapping-radar/,"The South China Morning Post recently revealed plans for a new Chinese radar facility on the island of Hainan, China’s southernmost point. Described as a “high-powered incoherent scatter radar,” this installation will bounce radio waves off the Earth's high-altitude layer of charged gas called the ionosphere.



Although the project is in step with the county’s other mega-science projects—like planning the world’s most powerful particle accelerator, building the largest single dish radio telescope, or racing other nations to the nuclear fusion finish line—experts think the new facility is more interested in military matters than discovering the secrets of Earth’s upper atmosphere.

America’s Least Secret Weapon

The possible military benefits of an ionosphere radar isn’t lost on other countries, especially the U.S. The Navy and DARPA ran a similar facility–the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) in Gakona, Alaska—before it was passed to the University of Alaska in 2014. Although it was sold as a project focused on studying the ionosphere, these 40 acres of radar antennas figured prominently in conspiracy theories involving government-sanctioned weather control, human-made earthquake and tsunamis or just general “mental disruption throughout a region.”

HAARP array USAF

The conspiracy theories don't hold up, of course. Today the University of Alaska runs HAARP, pointing its arrays skyward for researching atmospheric plasmas, solar wind, and the behavior of particles in the ionosphere. But militaries are still intensely interested in the ionosphere because of one major tool on today’s modern battlefield: satellites.

During HAARP’s military tenure, experiments investigated possibilities of turning the ionosphere into a giant antenna for Extremely Long Frequency (ELF) radio waves. Unlike shorter radio wavelengths, ELFs travel through water and can be picked up by submarines at operating depth as deep as several hundred feet and several experiments tested this methods sub-aquatic communication abilities. The U.S. also hypothesized that ELF could detect mines or interfere with enemy satellites.

The Chinese facility will be similar to HAARP in many ways. Expected to begin construction later this year, it’ll be somewhat smaller having only “several hundred” megawatts, compared to HAARP’s 5.1 gigawatts of power. The big difference is motivation: the main purpose of the facility is apparent in its incredibly strategic location in the South China Sea.

China’s Reply

HAARP was deliberately sited in the wilds of Alaska; the nearest settlement is Gakona, population two hundred. The Chinese facility is on the densely-population island of Hainan, beside Sanya, a beach-side city bigger than Miami or Honolulu with more than four hundred thousand inhabitants.



It’s an unusual location, according to Sue Mitchell of the University of Alaska Geophysical Institute, who says HAARP’s location was so remote partly because its high-power transmissions could have big city complications. “These can interfere with commercial radio stations in the area,” Mitchell told Popular Mechanics. “Siting it near a major city could cause issues.”

“Siting it near a major city could cause issues.”

There’s also the question of air traffic. HAARP’s radio beam would have serious effects on any passing plane’s electronics. Whenever the facility is in operation, a Temporary Flight Restriction closes the surrounding area to aircraft. This happens only three or four times a year, but it can last up to ten days at a time.

“Air traffic is pretty sparse around Gakona, Alaska,” says Mitchell. “That was part of the reason for it being located where it is.”

By contrast, Hainan is the middle of international air traffic lanes for flights to China, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Any high-powered transmission is going to cause significant disruption or risk accidents. But where its location might be a headache for airline industries, it’s military benefits are equally numerous.

As long as U.S. submarines operate in this part of the world, China has no chance of dominating it. But a system which could blank out ELF communications and selectively interfere with other satellite communications would severely affect any submarine operations in the South China Sea.

China could even use the new array as a transmitter for ELF radar to detect submarines at long range. The U.S. Navy discounted this approach in the ‘80s but the technology may be ripe for reappraisal. At least a dozen of recent scientific papers have looked at ELF radar for investigating underground features, finding natural resources, and locating pipelines. Interestingly, almost all these research papers have been from China. One paper suggests the same technique might be applied to ‘underwater target detection,’ another looks at ELFs for detection of underwater objects. Finding submarines is definitely on the agenda.

This idea isn’t as far-fetched as it seems. In order to make it work, a military would need aircraft flying nearby with a magnetic detector to pick up radar returns. China’s new Y-8Q Maritime Surveillance Aircraft can do just that—and it’s already deployed in the South China Sea.



Science Plus Military Equals Power

Journalist Stephen Chen, who broke the story about the new ionospheric radar in the South China Morning Post, told Popular Mechanics he has no doubt that the Hainan radar is primarily a military project.

While the facility may also have a scientific function, Chen says there is little talk surrounding the project in recent international academic meetings and the fact that many of its details are classified is unusual for such a “scientific” project.

“The available information strongly suggested the facility's role and function to help China strengthen its grip on the South China Sea,” says Chen, who spoke with multiple inside sources about military aspects of the project.

China already leads the world in scientific output, and now its science is joining forces with its invigorated military ambitions. Hainan’s new ionospheric radar is not an earthquake-producing, hurricane-causing superweapon that many conspiracy theorists fear, but it may be the beginning of a major powershift in the South China Sea.

Each afternoon at 4:30, the train from Pyongyang to Beijing passes over a rickety old bridge spanning the Yalu River, the border between North Korea and China. North Korean passengers wearing pins bearing the images of past leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il wave to hordes of Chinese tourists who come here, China's northeastern border city of Dandong, to catch a glimpse of the mysterious land across the river.

Occasional trains are some of the only traffic left on the China-Korea Friendship Bridge. This is the crossing point for 70 percent of goods entering North Korea from China — things like coal, fuel and household appliances — which are typically transported from Dandong, a gleaming metropolis, to drab Sinuju, the North's second-largest city.

But these are atypical times: United Nations sanctions on North Korea for its nuclear and weapons tests have reduced traffic on this bridge to a trickle. The effects are hitting the economy of this Chinese city hard as well.

But in April, Dandong's hopes were suddenly lifted. A historic meeting between leaders of North and South Korea provided raised optimism here that the closed country across the river may soon open for business. The summit planned for next week between President Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un has added more fuel to the anticipation. And investors from across China have flooded in to this border city of 2.4 million.

""They came from Beijing, Wenzhou, and all over northeast China,"" says Bob Li, a Dandong real estate agent.

Li says in the two weeks following the inter-Korean summit, a surge of real estate investors into the city catapulted home prices by more than 50 percent. He promptly began renovating his office to accommodate more customers.

""I've never seen anything like this in Dandong,"" says Li, as workers scurry around him. ""We'd have several buyers coming in from all over China buying up apartments. To them, the homes were very cheap, so they would buy as many as possible.""

And now, a border town suffering from international trade sanctions is back in business, with apartment complexes and Spanish-style villas under construction, despite new rules hastily handed down by the local government to curb speculation and stabilize the spike in prices. A bulk of the sales has taken place near the foot of a massive, new suspension bridge China built across the river to North Korea in the hopes that the North would build a road to it on the other side.

Kim Jong Un refused.

So for four years, the four-lane, $330 million bridge has connected the world's second-largest economy to a farm field on the North Korean side of the river. It was supposed to replace the friendship bridge built in 1943 and boost trade.

""The rumor around town is that if the North opens up, it'll finally build a road to the new bridge, and our city will be linked to Seoul by road,"" says Li. ""Pyongyang would just be a stop on the way.""

Visions of a land link between Dandong and an economic giant like South Korea HAVE attracted real estate investors like Mr. Xu. He only gives his surname for fear of getting caught up in local authorities' crackdown on property speculation.

Xu just arrived from Shanghai, over 1,100 miles away by land. ""Whatever happens between the U.S. and the North is irrelevant,"" he insists. ""It's clear to me that the relationship between China and North Korea is moving forward, and if the North opens up as a result, Dandong will be transformed. This is a port city after all.""

But local business people remain skeptical. Four men sit outside their auto parts shop in central Dandong, grousing about how outsiders are taking a big gamble by investing in this city.

""I just don't think a summit with Trump will persuade North Korea to open up,"" says a man who only gave the name Yang, for fear of retribution for speaking to foreign media.

""Trump's always changing his mind, and we don't know what Kim Jong Un ever thinks, either. The two of them behave just like little children,"" he says. ""Why should we put the future of our city in their hands?""

Sorrento Therapeutics Inc is among a few early-stage U.S. biotechs wary of being overlooked in a crowded New York stock market and looking at listing itself in Hong Kong as Asia’s financial center rolls out the red carpet with a drastic overhaul of listing rules.

Striving to catch up with New York and Shanghai as an IPO hotspot, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange announced new policies late last year that actively court biotech companies, including those that do not have a drug on the market.

The new rules particularly target early-stage biotech companies with a minimum market value of about $200 million, including those that do not yet earn revenue.

Sorrento, which is developing CAR-T cancer drugs and medicines to treat pain, is among a group of companies that believe they will get a more enthusiastic reception in Asia - and with it a higher valuation and more money.

“We strongly believe we are under-appreciated in the U.S. and our shareholders deserve more,” Chief Financial Officer Shao told Reuters.

In February, the drugmaker announced plans to pursue a second listing in Hong Kong in a letter to shareholders.

Sorrento has since said it expects to complete the listing by the end of the year or in the first quarter of next year and believes investors in China are especially keen to pump money into CAR-T drugs, a new generation of cancer medicines that involve genetically manipulating patients’ immune systems.

“In Hong Kong there’s only one company that has a CAR-T program, which is Genscript Biotech Corporation, and it has a market value of around $6 billion. That has appreciated from about $700 million since last year, so you’re talking about an 8 to 10 fold appreciation,” Shao says.

Wendy Pan, a partner at law firm Sidley Austin LLP, who convened a group of biotech companies and investors to provide industry feedback to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on revamping the rules, says early-stage biotech firms are valued higher in China than in the U.S.

“A lot of general funds in China are now setting up dedicated healthcare teams and are willing to pay more just to get into the space,” she said.

Pan estimates that by the end of the year, about half a dozen biotechs will probably list in Hong Kong, and another 10 will have submitted their applications.

BIOSIMILAR ATTENTION

Intense competition for capital in the United States, especially in revolutionary new fields of drug development like gene therapies and immuno-oncology, is also helping drive more smaller fish to foreign waters.

David Wang, Senior Managing Director at healthcare investor OrbiMed Asia, cites biosimilars - FDA-approved knock-offs of biologic medicines which are made in living cells - as one technology attracting a lot of attention.

“Some companies from a U.S. perspective are not novel, but for China ... they are a very novel thing,” Wang said.

“If you’re a biosimilar company in the U.S. people don’t believe that’s going to be a big deal. However, in China biosimilar is big stuff.”

With a lack of experience, however, comes more risk in a capital-intensive sector where firms often have no revenue at all to show when fundraising.

A number of analysts also say that there is no big shortage of capital for biotech in the United States.

“Biotech investing is a little bit of a minefield... (and) in a market that’s not used to investing in early stage biotech, it comes with a lot of risk,” Oppenheimer analyst Mark Breidenbach said.

“I don’t see any of my other companies flocking to list on the Hong Kong exchange.”

If reports on one of the sector’s unicorns, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates-backed blood-testing company Grail Inc, are anything to go by, however, company executives are being attracted by the enthusiasm of Asian investors.

Bloomberg reported earlier this year that Grail, which already raised $900 million to support its trials last year, would reel in $500 million in Hong Kong.

Ira Pastor, CEO of privately held Bioquark, also argues that there might be more money in total in the private equity space than ever before, but for smaller companies “its not going to come from U.S. private equity.”

“Clearly it (Hong Kong) is an area of the world that there’s a lot of wealth floating around in (and it) represents a pool that maybe even understands our story a little better than the U.S.,” he said.","Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180614&t=2&i=1272570011&r=LYNXMPEE5D1CB&w=800,"['listing', 'million', 'cash', 'kong', 'company', 'flood', 'gates', 'lot', 'hong', 'companies', 'china', 'biotechs', 'market', 'biotech', 'open']", 
14,14,FL-2018-000068-CHN,The China-India rivalry is causing an ecological disaster in the Himalayas - Quartz India,https://qz.com/india/1307728/the-china-india-rivalry-is-causing-an-ecological-disaster-in-the-himalayas/,"Chinese and Indian competition on their shared Himalayan border is more likely to create a slow-moving environmental catastrophe than a quick military or nuclear disaster.

The Himalayan plateau plays a crucial role in Asia. It generates the monsoonal rains and seasonal ice-melts that feed rivers and deliver nutrients to South, Southeast and East Asia. Almost half the world’s population and 20% of its economy depend on these rivers, and they are already threatened by climate change. China and India’s competition for their headwaters increases this threat.

Until the mid-20th century, the Himalayas’ high altitude prevented its large-scale development and conserved its environment. But after the Republic of India and the People’s Republic of China were created in the late 1940s, these two new states began competing for high ground in the western and eastern Himalayas. They fought a war over their unresolved border in 1962, and have scuffled ever since. The most recent clash was in 2017, when China built a road into Doklam, an area claimed by Bhutan and protected by India.

The mine sits on a deposit of gold, silver, and other precious metals worth up to $60 billion.

Tensions rose again last week when China unveiled a new mine in Lhunze, near the de facto border with India’s northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, east of Bhutan. The mine sits on a deposit of gold, silver, and other precious metals worth up to $60 billion.

Most analyses of the Sino-Indian border dispute have focused on the potential for another war between these two nuclear-armed neighbours. The environmental impacts of their continued entrenchment are rarely mentioned, despite the fact that they are significant and growing.

Author provided The various tracts of the disputed Sino-Indian border are host to many new development projects.

All of this development along the border is built on the world’s third-largest ice-pack or in biodiversity hotspots. The region was militarised during the 1962 war, and has since been inundated by troops, roads, airports, barracks, and hospitals. These have caused deforestation, landslides, and—if a study on troop movements on other glaciers is any guide—possibly even glacial retreat.

These projects have not been profitable or environmentally sound.

The build-up of troops on the border has displaced local ethnic groups, and they have been encouraged to give up their land to make way for intensive farming. Animal habitats have decreased and clashes with tigers and snow lions have increased. Population transfers and agricultural intensification have even heightened the risk that antibiotic-resistant superbugs and other toxic pollutants will seep into the world’s most diffused watershed.

During the past 20 years, first China and then India have increased this degradation by building large-scale mines and hydroelectric dams in this sensitive region. These projects have not been profitable or environmentally sound, but they have solidified state control by entrenching populations, upgrading transport networks, and integrating these fringes into national economies. The tightening of state control along the border has been further complicated by calls from the Tibetans and other ethnic groups for greater autonomy.

Many of the projects have been developed within the transnational Brahmaputra River basin. This river’s headwaters are in China, but most of its catchment is in Arunachal Pradesh, which is controlled by India but claimed by China. It then flows through Assam and Bangladesh, where it joins River Ganga. Some 630 million people live in the Ganga-Brahmaputra River catchment.

China and India’s geopolitical-resources rush threatens the safety of this entire river system. The new Lhunze mine’s position among the Brahmaputra’s headwaters is so precarious that its owner, Hua Yu Mining, was only allowed to mine there under strict environmental conditions. To its credit, Hua Yu has agreed to be a “green” miner, limiting emissions and water use, and minimising “grassland disturbance.” But even if the company does not inadvertently leak acid and arsenic into the environment like other mines in Tibet, the mine is still liable to be damaged by the region’s frequent earthquakes. Any toxic leak from Lhunze will flow straight into the Brahmaputra and then into the lower Ganges.

On its side of the border, India has concentrated on dams rather than mines. Between 2000 and 2016, the Arunachal Pradesh government approved the construction of 153 dams, before realising that it had overextended itself.

China has already built four dams in the upper Brahmaputra river basin.

So far, only one dam is complete, and all the other projects have stalled. One of these stalled dams is on River Subansiri, the same river from which the Lhunze mine draws water. India is racing to build these dams without community consultation or environmental studies because it sees itself as competing with China for the region’s water. China has already built four dams in the upper Brahmaputra river basin.

Indian strategists argue that they can stop China building more dams by building hydroelectric projects whose need for water will be recognised under international law. Given China’s dismissal of previous rulings by the International Court of Justice, and its recent refusal to share water-flow data with India after the Doklam incident (data that India needs to plan flood controls), this strategy seems unlikely to succeed.

Even if it does, it is hard to see how building large hydropower projects in an earthquake-prone region will ultimately help India. It won’t stop China developing the borderland, and it could cause more problems than it solves.

To keep Asia’s major rivers flowing and relatively non-toxic, both nations need to stop competing and start collaborating. Their leaders understand that neither nation would win a nuclear war. Now they need to realise that no one will benefit from destroying a shared watershed.

Thanks to Nuwa and Fuxi, mankind’s earliest ancestors in the mythology of ancient China, human beings were created to live happily in the world. However, that peaceful and harmonious life didn’t last long.

Heaven and Earth were in serious disruption on a Winter Solstice eve. Fires blazed out of control, water flooded in great expanses, the Earth trembled and groaned, trees were uprooted and livestock and humans in their millions were submerged instantly.

Nuwa seemed to have foreseen the catastrophes as she was busy collecting calabashes, which later became boats, from all corners of the world. However, no one understood that at the time.

Rushing out of her house, Nuwa stretched out her arms to the sky. A golden calabash fell into her hands. Growing quickly, it was transformed into a magic boat — the flames went out and the ocean waves moved back as they touched it.

Not until all the people, livestock and beasts had climbed into the boat did Nuwa and Fuxi go aboard.

SHINE

Days later, the rain stopped, the flood receded and the sun finally came out.

“Look,” Fuxi pointed to the northwest sky. After undergoing such a devastating disaster, he looked gaunt.

Nuwa saw a huge hole in the sky. Panicked and fearful, people found that a piece of land had collapsed in the southeast.

The catastrophes were caused by the battle between Zhuanxu, a mythological emperor of the north who was connected with the element of water, and Gonggong, a water god.

Zhuanxu was adjusting the season, which annoyed Gonggong who bumped his head against Mount Buzhou, a pillar holding up the sky.

The pent-up qi, or energy flow, was thus released from the mountain, which caused the collapse of the sky and Earth.

Many tribes reached out to help the people who were greatly afflicted, including those of Shaohao, or Emperor Yan, and his brother, Emperor Huang.

While people were enjoying the food given by the other tribes, Nuwa was staring at the hole and thinking about how to mend the sky.

She went to the beach of the East Sea and bowed down. Suddenly, a giant tortoise appeared along with strong winds whipping up waves. Nuwa jumped on its back and then a big wave pushed them to the west. In the blink of an eye, they arrived at Mount Taihang.

“Gods, please help me,” shouted Nuwa.

SHINE

Soon after, four gods from the four directions gathered together. Goumang, the god of wood, rode a dragon carrying green stones from the east. Zhurong, the god of fire, rode a qilin (Chinese unicorn) with red stones from the south. Xuanming, the god of water, rode a tortoise with black stones from the north. Rushou, the god of metal, rode a phoenix with white stones from the west.

“Where is the god of Mount Taihang?” asked Nuwa.

Just then, the clouds scattered, and a pot made of gold and jade appeared. The four deities put the colored stones into the pot. Then, Nuwa set fire to the stones.

After six days, she finally heard the sound of boiling water. However, opening the lid, she found that the colored stones were still separated.

She asked Emperor Huang for a favor. The yellow dragon brought a bag of yellow stones which were poured into the pot. Not long after, the stones of five colors were turned into thick liquid.

Bringing the five-color mixture, Nuwa went to Mount Buzhou where sheer precipices and rubble could be seen everywhere. The huge hole was just hanging over her head.

Nuwa scooped up the thick liquid and said, “Go!” Pushed by winds, the liquid flew to the black hole and covered it. However, the mixture was so heavy that it dripped down gradually.

SHINE

SHINE

A large cloud, sent by the deity Haotian, floated in the valley. Nuwa scooped up the thick liquid again, and this time with the support of the cloud, the mixture successfully covered part of the hole.

With her intensive efforts, the black hole became smaller and smaller. At last, the bright sky reappeared.

Nevertheless, Nuwa still worried that the patched sky might be too low and therefore asked the giant tortoise for a great miracle.

Nuwa pulled out a sword with tears in her eyes and made three deep bows. The tortoise cut off its four legs which the four gods carried in the four directions.

“Grow!” said Nuwa. The four legs got increasingly longer and became four pillars to support the sky. The sun, the moon, the stars, everything went back to their original positions except for the Earth.

It was a black dragon that had made mischief. Nuwa threw a cow as decoy into the abyss. After a while, the evil dragon surfaced and Nuwa shot an arrow toward it. The dragon turned out to be a python.

A large quantity of reeds grew up after the flood. Nuwa ordered people to pile up reeds and burn them to cinders which were used to stop the surging water.

The sky was patched, the pillars were set up, the devil was killed and the flood was drained. Nuwa not only created mankind but also made the world reborn.","Fri, 01 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://obj.shine.cn/files/2018/05/31/efb3e2b9-ba93-472d-884a-a488906cc870_0.jpg,"['hole', 'world', 'nuwa', 'tortoise', 'stones', 'god', 'went', 'water', 'sky', 'dragon', 'mends']",

China's Central Meteorological Observatory continues to announce a blue warning for the rainstorm.

Just in Guangdong province alone as of June 9, more than 73,000 people were forced to relocate and more than 140 outbound and inbound flights had been canceled in Baiyun International Airport located in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province. Houses collapsed and landslides caused by pouring rain have killed five residents in the city of Yunfu. More than 3,000 emergency shelters have been opened and over 8,000 residents were resettled. According to the provincial insurance regulatory authorities as of June 11, typhoon Ewiniar had caused nearly 300 million yuan (about 47 million U.S. dollars) of damage in Guangdong excluding Shenzhen, the second largest city in the province.

Surveillance video installed in the city of Jiangmen, Guangdong showed flooded streets.

However against all odds, with the close cooperation among police, firefighters, departments of health and meteorology as well as volunteers, no candidate in Guangdong was absent in the annually held collage entrance exams on account of the extreme weather, reported by Nan Fang Daily.

Every year, students nationwide take Gaokao - collage entrance exams on June 7 and 8, which are known for being tough and life-changing. This year in Guangdong, around 733,000 students participated in exams, the second largest number in the country. 502 examination points were set up and the number of relevant staff was nearly 100,000. It was raining dogs and cats on those two days, parts of the cities had already been flooded.

Southern China are frequently hit by typhoons. Mawar, 16th typhoon of 2017, landed in Guangdong, bringing gales of 20 meters per second at its eye. 2,200 fishing boats had returned to the harbor while more than 15,000 people were relocated to safety. Typhoon Hato, 13th typhoon formed in the northwest Pacific of 2017, caused downpours hitting areas of Guangdong and Fujian provinces.

Haima, 22nd typhoon of 2016, severely impacted the economy of southern China in sectors including aquaculture, agriculture, tourism and forestry. In Fujian, the economic impact could reach 37 million yuan, with damage to about 200 hectares of crops. In Guangdong, around 3,400 houses and some 189,600 hectares of crops had been damaged with losses calculated at 4.18 billion yuan (about $617 million). Hainan, the island province, suffered an economic loss of 4.56 billion yuan (about $712 million) from Typhoon Sarika, 21st typhoon of the year.

But disasters don't just bring damages, but also touching stories.

More natural disasters are likely to happen with climate change. Heroes are needed in our time, and indeed they are not too far away.

What China wants

Beijing and Pyongyang ultimately possess the same goals for the Trump-Kim summit: get the White House to relax sanctions on the isolated nation, according to Gregory Kulacki, a China expert at the global security program of research and advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). ""China and North Korea have cut their deal already,"" Kulacki said on a UCS podcast. That deal entails Xi's administration resuming some economic relations with Kim's government if the latter freezes missile and nuclear weapons tests, he explained.

But ""in order for China to open the economic door a little bit, there is going to have to be some relaxation of those sanctions, which means there's gonna have to be some concession from the United States,"" Kulacki continued, adding that such a scenario would constitute a victory for both Pyongyang and Beijing. During a May meeting between Kim and Xi, the Chinese leader re-emphasized support for North Korea to stick to denuclearization while Kim was quoted as telling Xi that Pyongyang won't need to possess nuclear weapons if a ""relevant party"" drops its ""hostile policy and security threats,"" evidently referring to the U.S. Shortly following that encounter, Trump said Kim was possibly being influenced by Xi. The U.S. president also urged China to maintain a secure border with the pariah state. Trump tweet Ideally, China's outcome for the Tuesday meeting is for ""a soft landing"" — that is, ""a denuclearized North Korea that gradually carries out reform and opens up its society, which will make economic dynamism in the sub-region possible,"" said Ren Xiao, professor of international studies at Shanghai's Fudan University.

19,19,FL-2018-000068-CHN,China in control as industry enters new era - Automotive News,https://www.autonews.com/article/20180611/GLOBAL03/180619968/china-in-control-as-industry-enters-new-era,"BEIJING — When the head of China's largest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, took the stage in April ahead of the Beijing auto show, the event unfolded as a warning shot to the rest of the world.

CEO Cheng Wei said the company was bringing together 31 eager automotive suitors, including global heavyweights Toyota, Volkswagen and the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, to tackle one of the hottest issues: developing cheap, electrified vehicles and new mobility technologies for the world's biggest auto market.

The scale would be mammoth, fathomable only in the context of China. Didi, he said, would bring 1 million electric vehicles into its ride-hailing network by 2020 and some 10 million by 2028.

Cheng, all of 35 years old, then perfectly captured the zeitgeist sweeping the Middle Kingdom.

""China could play a pivotal role in transforming the existing automotive and transportation structure that has been in place for over 100 years,"" Cheng said. Didi, he promised, would help China's auto industry leapfrog ""from a global leader in scale to a global leader in innovation.""

China has been the world's biggest auto market since 2009, when it eclipsed the U.S. But only recently has it reached a long-anticipated — and in some quarters long-feared — tipping point. Instead of being a passive center of sales, profits and production, China is taking the wheel as a true driver of the global industry in innovation, development, investment and more.

The trajectory fits a global pattern. The auto industry was born in Europe more than a century ago, dominated by Detroit after World War II and then turned on its head by the Japanese at the end of the 20th century. Now, it is China's turn to leave its stamp.

""The tipping point has already happened,"" said Bill Russo, CEO of Shanghai consultancy Automobility and a former China executive at Chrysler and auto electronics supplier Harman. ""China won. They understand it's not just about who is going to lead development of the car but who is going to shape future mobility. It's a new era.""

How to make sense of this historic crossroads?

The Chinese juggernaut can be viewed through several lenses: customer, exporter, rival, partner, innovator. And now, as the industry's global dictator.

China as customer

As Didi's draw of international partners shows, foreign carmakers see China's massive market as a pool of almost unlimited sales. Its sales growth has cooled from the breakneck double digits of recent years. But domestic demand is up a healthy 4.5 percent this year through April, while other major markets, such as the U.S., continue to plateau.

Light-vehicle sales in China will climb 2.1 percent to 28.5 million vehicles this year, IHS Markit forecasts. And domestic demand will keep soaring to some 32 million in 2022, IHS predicts.

Volume in North America, by comparison, is expected to stagnate around 20 million over that period, while Western European sales flatline at around 16 million.

China has plenty of room to expand. Car ownership in the world's biggest market was only about 121 vehicles per 1,000 people in 2015 and is forecast to reach only 200 by 2021, according to IHS Markit. That is still far below the 814 vehicles per 1,000 people in the U.S.

China is the biggest market for several manufacturers, including Volkswagen and General Motors. Others, including Nissan, expect China to be their biggest soon. For Volkswagen Group, China alone accounted for 40 percent of global sales in 2017.

Because of that, Chinese customers are wielding their influence on the global stage.

Chinese tastes and trends increasingly will flavor models sold worldwide. More vehicles will be developed for China first before being sold in the United States and other markets.

Bigger back seats were an early outgrowth of tailoring cars to Chinese tastes.","Mon, 11 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://s3-prod.autonews.com/s3fs-public/styles/800x600/public/COPY_306159999_AR_1_JQNRFFJWJGOA.jpg,"['enters', 'industry', 'million', 'sales', 'era', 'vehicles', 'chinas', 'biggest', 'control', 'worlds', 'global', 'auto', 'china', 'market']", 
20,20,FL-2018-000068-CHN,China eyes its next prize – the Mekong - The Interpreter,https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/china-eyes-its-next-prize-mekong,"Beijing’s islands-building in the South China Sea and their militarisation, replete with surface-to-air missiles, is near complete. With guile, threat, and coercion, China can now seize control of one of the main transport arteries of Southeast Asia, making a mockery of international laws and norms.

But there is another prize in Beijing’s sights, an artery that runs straight through mainland Southeast Asia. The mighty Mekong River, which starts in China (known there as Lancang), and connects Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia, is a crucial lifeline that nourishes some 60 million people along its banks.

Control of both the South China Sea and Mekong River will strategically sandwich mainland Southeast Asia. Indeed, Beijing’s control of Southeast Asian rivers looks set to be the other half of its “salami slicing” strategy in the region.



Famine is more terrible than the sword

Controlling the Mekong River’s flow with dams along the waterway ultimately means controlling access to food, and therefore the livelihoods of tens of millions of people in downstream riparian communities. Of the hydroelectricity dams on the Mekong, the vast majority of currently installed capacity (megawatts) is in China, accounting for more than 15,000 MW. This includes a half-dozen mega-dams over 1000 MW, including Nuozhadu dam which churns out 5850 MW.

Together these dams can hold back 23 billion cubic metres of water, or 27% of the river’s annual flow between China and Thailand. Other dams in the lower Mekong are piddling by comparison, with generating capacity in the tens or low hundreds of MW.

The bottom line: Chinese dams can now regulate the Mekong’s flow.

This is even more pronounced in the dry season when the Tibetan Plateau contributes between 40 and 70% of the river’s flow. The impact on food and livelihoods is dramatic now, but could soon be far worse if 11 proposed mega-dams, half with some Chinese involvement, go ahead.

A recent UNESCO and Stockholm Environment Institute report suggests sediment flows in the river could reduce by up to 94% if the proposed dams go ahead, significantly affecting fish catches and overall river health. This will directly affect downstream riparian communities.

More worryingly, the raison d’être of the proposed dams and oft-cited promise of a crucial electricity boost for the economies of the lower Mekong has been found to be misguided. Many of the proposed lower Mekong dams will export their energy to China, and others will have direct negative impacts on the economy. It is projected that over the next 50 years, the cost for the lower Mekong basin economy will be a net negative $7.3 billion, with Vietnam and Cambodia the worst off. The social costs could be just as astronomical.



Dams as dominoes

During a recent trip to Laos, I encountered concerns about Chinese dams being used as strategic levers, producing unannounced upstream releases of water that impact not only communities but also new downstream dams. In such a case, the downstream dams would need to immediately release water through the spillway, at best resulting in the loss of valuable generating capacity, potentially impacting electricity supply, and at worst flooding downstream villages or damaging the integrity of the dam wall.

Already many of the dams on the tributaries of the Mekong are uninformed of upstream releases in the Mekong proper, potentially affecting their own release of water by creating a flood surge when the released waters converge. One of the operators of a joint venture dam in Laos confided that there was often little or no forewarning when water from a Chinese-built upstream dam was released.

Many of these dams are Southeast Asian state–owned or involve European firms, which could further complicate matters if an incident occurred. Indeed, the release of unscheduled upstream water by Chinese-owned dams could be used to engineer a public protest against the downstream dam’s parent company. That is concerning because it turns dams into dominoes, with China at first fall.

Dams without water, or without sufficient water in their reservoirs, also disrupt economies as they are unable to supply expected electricity output. With upstream Chinese firms controlling the Mekong’s flow, it has suffered drought-like conditions attributed to the irregular flow of the river itself.

Nam Ngum 1 hydroelectric dam in Laos (Photo: Elliot Brennan)

Salinisation of the Mekong at its mouth in Vietnam is one example; soil erosion across the river system is another. It’s a huge problem for those that rely on the river – the Mekong Delta in Vietnam alone produces 40% of the country’s rice and much of the basin’s protein.



All hail Yu Shi

A much-overlooked and further source of strength in China’s control of the river system, as well as river systems across the subcontinent, is the cloud seeding project named Tianhe. The project’s stated objective is to increase rainfall by 10 billion cubic metres – 7% of China’s current consumption – over the Tibetan Plateau that feeds into key transboundary rivers, including the Mekong, Brahmaputra, Indus, and Salween.

The project, part of the broader artificial weather project, would seed rain to fall over the plateau and into the catchments of these rivers. This water would then be regulated by Chinese dams (see this comprehensive map), or could be redirected domestically. But as Carnegie Council’s Janos Pasztor notes, the seeding doesn’t produce rain, “it makes it happen somewhere, which means that it will not happen somewhere else”.

Controlling the weather and ensuring rain falls within China is the next step to controlling water flows to neighbouring countries. In part, this is worrying because China’s current record of natural resource management is far from stellar: some 70% of rivers and lakes in China are polluted.

Moreover, the potential control of rainfall creates further problems. In good times it encourages countries to build electricity-generating dams, and in bad could mean downstream drought and a full-scale weaponisation of water. (An excellent anecdote on this is here).



Blowing up islands

Dams and rainfall are only one part of the equation. In contrast with its islands-building in the South China Sea, China has embarked on a “Mekong River Navigation Channel Improvement Project” that involves blasting islets, rapids, and rocks in the Mekong River to create a shipping lane through the heart of mainland Southeast Asia to Laos.

The environmental and social damages, as well as a new highway for the import of Chinese products, are expected to have a net negative impact on Southeast Asian economies. As such, Bangkok is yet to yield to the project on the Thai segment of the river.

Given the current assertiveness of Beijing’s foreign policy, in the event of war this inland maritime highway would become a strategic nightmare. This, alongside the negative economic outlook for the region, provides worrying prospects for future sovereignty in mainland Southeast Asia.



Chinese tributaries of the Mekong

Unsurprisingly, Southeast Asian states and other concerned parties have long tried to bring China to the table to establish appropriate rules for cooperation.

The Mekong River Commission, established in 1995, aimed to do just that. Beijing dragged its feet, frustrating the cooperative body where it could. In 2016, in line with Beijing’s current my-way-or-the-highway style of diplomacy, it launched its own group.

The Lancang-Mekong Cooperation has bullied states into working together. As a carrot for Southeast Asian states’ participation in the first LMC in March 2016, Beijing released water to drought-stricken downstream countries.

The threat was implicit: China controls the river. This notion is the antecedent to conflict, not cooperation.

These concerns over the Mekong and other rivers, and their place in China’s geopolitical strategy, are not new (see some excellent long-form reading here, here, and here). But today we seem to be at a tipping point, to which the region must respond.

Southeast Asian states, which are all set to lose, must find greater unity among themselves. European partners in Mekong River dams should explore alternative projects to supply energy. Others, such as Australia, must move away from the cavalier “Xi’ll be right mate” attitude, and with a concert of fair-minded friends support new energy alternatives and sustainability initiatives to boost resilience in mainland Southeast Asia.

China’s growing control over the Mekong is a crucial component of immobilising sovereignty in mainland Southeast Asia. It must be appropriately addressed and discouraged.","Tue, 05 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/Brennan%20banner%20-%20web%20MIN.jpg,"['rivers', 'dams', 'downstream', 'southeast', 'dam', 'project', 'mekong', 'china', 'water', 'eyes', 'prize', 'river']",

The previous articles can be read here, here, and here.

To understand Japan’s complex relationship with water, we must first turn to its topography. Nearly three-quarters of Japan’s land is mountainous, which forms the basis of its steep and short rivers. This limits the amount of rainwater that can be captured before it flows into the sea. As a nation that receives intense rainfall during specific periods of the year (rainy season from June to July and typhoon season from August to September), Japan has traditionally suffered from extreme floods.

In addition, Japan’s population is concentrated in areas with low elevation. Alluvial plains—areas lower than the flood water level of a flooded river—account for only 10 percent of the total land area. Yet, more than 50 percent of the population and 75 percent of the gross assets are concentrated in these plains. Tokyo, the capital city of Japan, is also built on alluvial plains. In fact, 13,120 square kilometers of Tokyo’s area is in the “zero-meter zone,” referring to land where the elevation is at or below sea level.

Droughts and Floods in Japan

The high concentration of the Japanese population in small habitable areas has made Japan historically vulnerable to droughts. Water supply areas affected by drought at least once in the past 30 years are shown on the map.

Exhibit: Areas Affected by Droughts Over the Past 30 Years

Prior to Japan’s modernization period, most of Japan’s water shortages were caused by severe droughts: 1939 Lake Biwa, 1964 Tokyo Olympics, 1967 Nagasaki, 1973 Takamatsu, and 1978 Fukuoka are some of the examples. According to a meta-analysis of Japan’s droughts from 1902 to 2009, the most severe drought took place from 1939 to 1941, lasting for 666 days. This drought very seriously affected water supply, electricity, hydropower generation, factories, railway and marine transportations. It was even considered the reason for the nationalization of major industries.

A more recent example is the nationwide drought that began in spring and ended in mid-September of 1994. The continuing low rainfall had deteriorated the water quality of major rivers near Lakes Sagami, Tsukui and Tanzawa and forced the rationing of water supply. Water rationing began in June in the Kiso River basin and spread to other districts. In the most extreme cases, water for irrigation and industrial use was rationed to a maximum of 65 percent—and 35 percent in the case of domestic uses. Rainfall started in September, and water rationing was relaxed and finally lifted in November.

Japan has also been fighting floods for centuries, and its evolving flood management has been documented extensively. The Tokyo that we know today is a product of engineering of the Tone River to the east and the Arakawa River to the west during the Tokugawa era (1603–1867). To avoid disasters in Tokyo’s east lowlands, the Arakawa Channel and Edogawa Channel and a reclamation land at Kasai were constructed. Dr. Nobuyuki Tsuchiya, chairperson of Japan River Restoration Network, warns against the current false sense of security in Tokyo, stressing that simulations have shown that there is a high probability of floods affecting lowlands and localities with lower height of dykes on the left side of the Arakawa River. He predicts that, as sea level rises due to climate change, in times of high tides, Edogawa city (one of Tokyo’s wards) could be flooded within two days. In light of the high population density in eastern lowlands, he urges the population to remain vigilant toward natural disasters.

What Can Be Done?

Given the extreme risks of floods, extensive infrastructure development as well as forested areas, or green dams, have become essential elements for flood management in the country. The strong support toward forest management for water management primarily comes from the civil society and has largely been shaped by the media rather than academia.

Forests cannot replace dams or vice versa: They complement each other. Dams continue to be constructed and, at the same time, policies, laws and regulations are enacted, promoting integrated forest and water management at the national level.

Coming back to extreme events such as droughts and floods, the Bureau of Waterworks, under the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, has planned for mitigation and adaptation measures in the face of climate change impacts on waterworks. It estimates that the number of days with heavy rain (100 mm or more per day) is expected to increase to up to 10 days per year in the next 100 years.

Mitigation measures include use of renewable energy, forest conservation and drainage infrastructure for leakage prevention. With respect to adaptation measures, not surprisingly, the National Plan for Adaptation to the Impacts of Climate Change also considers natural disasters.

Japan has been affected by extreme events such as droughts and floods throughout its history, which has made its institutions and its society aware of the importance of preparedness. With climate variability and change, these events are only expected to increase.

Can Asia Learn from the Japan Experience?

The level of preparedness shown by Japan can be a lesson for numerous countries in the region—and globally—that are still to plan or are planning for the impacts resulting from changing climate.

There are numerous lessons countries in Asia can learn from Japan, including applied knowledge on hydrology, water resources management, management of droughts and floods, and public awareness and education for disaster prevention. However, in terms of adaptation in the region, just one example suffices. In the 1970s, Japan realized the importance of understanding water resources as part of the entire hydrological system rather than trying to control them by means of infrastructure alone. The pioneering work of Professor Yutaka Takahasi, the most renowned hydrologist of Japan, was essential for the country to accept the then path-breaking concept of water management at the basin level. Over the years, this has proven to be critical in achieving a more efficient management of water resources, including for floods and droughts. More than 40 years later, this concept has still not been implemented in most of the developing world.","Wed, 06 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.brinknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GettyImages-500720086.jpg,"['japan', 'river', 'climate', 'management', 'example', 'countries', 'japans', 'droughts', 'preparedness', 'floods', 'water', 'tokyo', 'asian', 'population', 'change', 'extreme']",

It refuses to acknowledge its human rights abuses, and discrimination against LGBT community and feminists.

It's not easy to do in the digital age, where nearly half of China's citizens use the internet.

These are four of the most commonly used tricks in the party's playbook.



The ways that China has been monitoring and ranking its citizens, secretly imprisoning ethnic minorities, and ignoring its LGBT community have been widely documented in the West.

But citizens in China itself may have no idea that any of these things are going on.

Beijing has a rich playbook of tactics to keep its 1.4 billion citizens from learning about the country's repression and abuse of human rights. They include paying people to flood the internet with pro-government social media posts, setting up police surveillance points to watch over ethnic communities, and banning content criticising the Chinese government.

Here are the four most commonly used tricks in Beijing's playbook.

1. Planting social media posts to distract from controversial news

China pays two million people to fabricate pro-government social media posts and insert them in real time, many of which immediately after controversial events, a Harvard University report found in 2016.

The commentators — known as the ""50 cent party,"" because they are allegedly paid 50 Chinese cents ($0.08/£0.06) per post — publish around 448 million posts a year, the researchers found. About half of them are stealthily inserted into social media sites in real time, while the others are posted on government sites.

Some examples include:

""Respect to all the people who have greatly contributed to the prosperity and success of the Chinese civilization! The heroes of the people are immortal.""

""Carry the red flag stained with the blood of our forefathers, and unswervingly follow the path of the CCP!""

""I love China.""

Jennifer Pan, one of the authors of the Harvard paper, told Business Insider: ""On social media, instead of engaging on controversial issues, China puts out massive amounts of happy, positive cheerleading posts. These posts seem aimed at distracting the public from controversial and central issues of the day.""

When deadly riots broke out between Uighur ethnic minorities and Chinese police in Xinjiang, northwestern China in 2013, officials in the southeastern city of Ganzhou — located about 2,000 miles away — ordered 50 cent workers to immediately create hundreds of online posts lauding China's economic development in an attempt to divert people from the topic.

The instructions were revealed after an anonymous source leaked emails describing the strategy.

An online commentator paid to publish pro-government posts also revealed anonymously in 2012: ""When transferring the attention of netizens [Chinese people on the internet] and blurring the public focus, going off the topic is very effective.""

This tactic also ""dilutes the quality of conversations,"" Sophie Richardson, the China director of Human Rights Watch, told Business Insider.

2. ""Development programs"" that are actually state surveillance

Since 2013 China has been increasing its government programmes in Tibet which are ostensibly aimed at poverty relief and improving local infrastructure. But are also reasons for Beijing to send its officials to root out what it considers threats to the regime.

Tibet is a sore point in Chinese politics. Beijing has consistently claimed the region as its own, while much of the region's three-million strong population has resisted Chinese Communist Party rule for decades.

Under what it calls a ""social management"" scheme, China runs an employment and skills training programme for Tibet. But mixed in with the support is ""ideological education"" for households, usually in the form of compulsory classes designed to instill a love of China in the participants.

It has also strengthened government surveillance in popular prefectures, Human Rights Watch said.

Under a separate ""grid management system,"" said to facilitate public access to basic goods and services, authorities also installed 600 high-tech ""convenience police posts"" and a volunteer surveillance group known as the ""Red Armband Patrols"" to watch over citizens, Human Rights Watch reported in 2013.

3. Refusing to acknowledge the news

China doesn't recognise same-sex marriage, and actively instructs censors and news outlets to avoid discussing LGBT issues.

Adam Robbins, a journalist living in Shenzhen, told Foreign Policy: ""For generations, there’s been no active Chinese state pushback against LGBT rights. Instead, the policy was 'don't encourage, don't discourage, don't promote.'""

Some companies appear to have have taken that policy to heart. Last month Weibo, one of China's largest social media platforms, announced a three-month purge of videos and images portraying homosexuality in a bid to ""create a bright and harmonious community environment."" It later reversed the decision, but only after tens of thousands of people complained online.

In mid-May, the popular Mango TV channel was also spotted blurring rainbow flags while airing the semi-final of the Eurovision song contest, resulting in the European Broadcasting Union banning Mango TV from airing the final altogether.

China also banned the depiction of gay people on TV in 2016 as part of a clampdown on ""vulgar, immoral and unhealthy content,"" and has shut down multiple same-sex dating apps.

4. Deleting posts it doesn't want to see

The country's policy of silence also appears to apply to other issues it wants to keep under wraps, such as sexual misconduct.

Earlier this year, hundreds of social media posts including the words #MeToo were deleted by censors. It's not clear whether those posts were censored by social networks voluntarily, or at the behest of the government, which keeps a close watch.

(Many women started using the characters 米兔, which technically stand for ""rice bunny"" but are pronounced ""mi tu,"" to circumvent the ban.)

State-run news outlets have also tried to deny the existence of sexual misconduct in China. Shortly after The New York Times published its Harvey Weinstein expose, the state-operated China Daily ran an editorial claiming that Chinese men never behave inappropriately toward women.

Censorship in China has soared under Xi Jinping's presidency, with thousands of censorship directives issued every year. China briefly banned the letter ""N"" in February, after critics used it to attack the president.

'It's like a cat-and-mouse game'

The reach of China's propaganda and censorship is growing in the digital age — but many citizens still take news published by state media with a grain of salt, and continue to find ways to circumvent censors.

Sophie Richardson, from Human Rights Watch, told BI:

""Internet censorship is apparently getting worse. More human rights stories get censored more frequently. And the Chinese government has been cracked down on unauthorised VPNs.

""But Chinese netizens continue to be creative in invading censorship. It’s like a cat-and-mouse game.""","Sat, 09 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.insider.com/5b114e131ae66246008b4a9f?width=1200&format=jpeg,"['chinese', 'human', 'tries', 'posts', 'chinas', 'social', 'pretending', 'spies', 'watch', 'china', 'paying', 'citizens', 'planting', 'rights', 'media', 'post']", 
23,23,FL-2018-000068-CHN,China warns US trade deals off if tariffs go ahead - CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/03/china-warns-us-trade-deals-off-if-tariffs-go-ahead.html,"China warned Sunday after another round of talks on a sprawling trade dispute with Washington that any deals they produce ""will not take effect"" if President Donald Trump's threatened tariff hike on Chinese goods goes ahead.

The warning came after delegations led by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and China's top economic official, Vice Premier Liu He, wrapped up a meeting on Beijing's pledge to narrow its trade surplus. Ross said at the start of the event they had discussed specific American exports China might purchase, but the talks ended with no joint statement and neither side released details.

The White House threw the meeting's status into doubt Tuesday by renewing a threat to impose 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese high-tech goods in response to complaints Beijing steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology. The event went ahead despite that but Beijing said it reserved the right to retaliate.

Tuesday's announcement revived fears the conflict between the two biggest economies might dampen global growth or encourage other governments to raise their own barriers to imports.

""If the United States introduces trade sanctions including a tariff increase, all the economic and trade achievements negotiated by the two parties will not take effect,"" said the Chinese statement, carried by the official Xinhua News Agency.

The negotiating process should be ""based on the premise"" of not fighting a ""trade war,"" the statement said.

The American Embassy in Beijing didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump is pressing Beijing to narrow its politically volatile trade surplus with the United States, which reached a record $375.2 billion last year.

Tensions eased after China promised on May 19 to ""significantly increase"" purchases of farm goods, energy and other products and services following the last round of talks in Washington. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the dispute was ""on hold"" and the tariff hike would be postponed.

That truce appeared to end with Tuesday's surprise announcement. It said the White House also will impose curbs on Chinese investment and purchases of U.S. high-tech goods and on visas for Chinese students.

Analysts suggested Trump might be trying to appease critics of his administration's deal to allow Chinese telecom equipment giant ZTE Corp. to stay in business. They said those political pressures mean the technology-related tariff hikes are likely to go ahead.

Members of Congress criticized the agreement to lift a ban on sales of U.S. components to ZTE, which admitted violating rules on exports to Iran and North Korea. In exchange, the company is to remove its management team, hire American compliance officers and pay a fine.

Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on a total of up to $150 billion of Chinese goods. Tuesday's announcement gave no indication whether the other increases might also go ahead.

China has threatened to retaliate by raising import duties on a $50 billion list of American goods including soybeans, small aircraft, whiskey, electric vehicles and orange juice. It criticized Tuesday's announcement but refrained from repeating its earlier threat.

Beijing has resisted U.S. pressure to commit to a firm target of narrowing its annual surplus with the United States by $200 billion.

Private sector analysts say while Beijing is willing to compromise on its trade surplus, it will resist changes that might threaten plans to transform China into a global technology competitor.

Ross was accompanied by agriculture, treasury and trade officials for the meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, a leafy compound on Beijing's west side. Liu's delegation included China's central bank governor and commerce minister.

Ross and Liu held a working dinner Saturday ahead of their talks.

""Our meetings so far have been friendly and frank, and covered some useful topics about specific export items,"" said Ross at the opening of Sunday's meeting.

The U.S. pressure over technology policy reflects growing American concern about China's status as a potential competitor and complaints Beijing improperly subsidizes its fledgling industries and shields them from competition.

Foreign governments and businesses cite strategic plans such as ""Made in China 2025,"" which calls for state-led efforts to create Chinese industry leaders in areas from robots to electric cars to computer chips.

Trade analysts had warned Ross's hand might be weakened by the Trump administration's decision Thursday to go ahead with tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Europe and Mexico.

That might alienate allies who share complaints about Chinese technology policy and a flood of low-priced steel, aluminum and other exports they say are the result of improper subsidies and hurt foreign competitors.","Sun, 03 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105081284-GettyImages-531109422.jpg?v=1532563665,"['chinese', 'billion', 'deals', 'tariff', 'goods', 'surplus', 'technology', 'beijing', 'american', 'china', 'trade', 'ahead', 'warns', 'tariffs']",

A flash flood warning was issued around 6pm local time (12.00am GMT), and many areas in Downton Baton Rouge and in the north of the city have experienced severe disruption. One social media user named Carey Darcey said: “Baton Rouge is flooding again. Get the boats ready!” Rebekah Allen added: “Cars are turning around on Government Street by the Garden District because of flooding.” Weather radars estimated the region would witness three inches of rain in some areas in less than an hour.

Baton Rouge is flooding again. Get the boats ready! Carey Darcey

As of 7pm local time (1am GMT), around 4,500 residents have been left without power in east Baton Rouge. Many vehicles have also been abandoned in rising flood water across the city, and numerous roads have been closed. Steve Caparotta, a meteorologist at Baton Rouge news station WAFB, said: “People having to try and push their vehicle after stalling in the flood waters near Florida and Acadian.” Talking directly to drivers entering flooded areas, he added: “Simple message here; Turn around, don’t drown!”

The flooding caused the I-110 road to be closed in both directions, close to N22nd Street and the Governor’s Mansion. Rain nevertheless appears to have become lighter across the city, but danger remains for residents and drivers entering flooded areas. Southern Louisiana is prone of heavy flooding, and the region witnessed one of the worst deluges in recent US history in 2016. Many rivers and waterways reached record levels, and rainfall exceeded 20 inches in numerous areas. Thirteen people were confirmed dead as a consequence of the flooding, and an estimated 146,000 homes were damaged across Louisiana.

According to one view, China’s rise, if unchecked, will leave Australia a mere vassal state, while the United Front Work Department rends the fabric of our democracy from within.

Viewed another way, Australia’s future economic prosperity depends on us embracing a new Chinese order. A slavish reliance on a declining America, demonstrably irresponsible and inwardly focused under President Donald Trump, will only make things worse.

While it is fashionable to say that Australia does not face a “China Choice”, our current hand-wringing certainly resembles it.

Unfortunately the debate, whether we need it or not, is doing more harm than good. Each side is guilty of exaggeration. The assumption that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) can easily subvert our national consciousness betrays a surprising lack of faith in Australian voters, not to mention democracy itself.

But to simply write off the US flies in the face of history and consigns our most important strategic ally to the scrapheap. Is there an easier way to bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy?

More worryingly, today’s simplistic pro-China/anti-China dichotomy reinforces a sense of tribalism. It subverts what should be a opportunity for reasoned discussion between genuine experts by slotting them into a pair of mutually exclusive echo chambers.

We have been passengers, if not active participants, in our own polarisation. Many of those who have invested the most in exacerbating division frequently profess their earnest desire for dialogue and compromise, without the slightest intention of following through.

The result is that emotion dominates at the expense of reason. That goes for Clive Hamilton’s bizarre Twitter acknowledgment that his estimates about Chinese Australians with strong pro-Beijing leanings are simply “guesses”, and his insinuation that some of our most moderate China experts are de facto fifth columnists. It also goes for Kevin Rudd’s claims about creeping McCarthyism, and Geoff Raby’s recent demand for Julie Bishop to be sacked because she doesn’t get on with Beijing.

The great pity is that there are reasonable positions on both sides that could help us navigate Australia’s security choices.

We should be worried about China’s attempts to compromise our critical infrastructure and our businesses; its posturing in the South China Sea; and its deliberate bilateralism via its Belt and Road Initiative that plays divide-and-rule with regional actors.

We should equally be concerned that the US has rapidly abrogated its leadership role in the economic architecture we benefited from immeasurably. Australia should not be reassured that regardless of Trump’s future, US foreign policy elites will continue to debate whether maintaining primacy in Asia is worth the expense. Since it is always more expedient to do nothing, or do less, we’ll need to work harder to convince Washington to do more.

Many have taken comfort from the just-concluded Shangri-La Dialogue, where Beijing was chastised by a roll call of participants, from India to Indonesia, with earnest backing by US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. But Shangri-La is a forum known for words rather than deeds.

Nothing less than a complete reassertion of US strategic dominance will dissuade the PRC that America is vulnerable. Any coalition of middle powers is no substitute for the US, nor is some loose maritime grouping, such as the Quad (India, Japan, Australia, and the US) which is still floundering despite numerous attempts to get the idea afloat.

Ultimately, we are going to need to sort out our position on China (our major trading partner) and the US (our major security ally) ourselves. And we don’t have the luxury of engaging in self-indulgent name-calling, because our choices now will increasingly have future costs that require sober and informed analysis.

Annoy China? Then we need to be prepared for a trade downgrade, and for the flood of Chinese students attending our universities to ease to a trickle. Annoy Trump? Then we will face an equally transactional response.

Critically, making informed decisions on our options will benefit much more from an engaged expertise base than a divided one. And having a realistic discussion about our national interests will also help Australia respond more proactively to national security concerns.

For instance, if we are worried about our universities creating dual-use defence technologies through Chinese research partnerships, we should look to create incentives for expertise via other sources of research and development investment, in areas such as nanotechnology, communications, and artificial intelligence.

For too long Australia’s default foreign policy setting has been to fear true independence, but chafe when our choices are constrained. That’s an oddly confined way of laying out our policy parameters.

Multipolarism in Asia could be a bonanza for middle powers with the foresight to seek influence in multiple camps, and encourage regional actors to compete for our affections. Unfortunately, our recent Foreign Policy and Defence White Papers fudged the question of “what does Australia want” in international affairs with the unhelpful answer, “the same as before”.

Putting the “middle” back into “middle power” will take courage, compromise, and engagement. It will require an active, engaged, and above all reasoned discussion of our core priorities. Anything less damages our national interest, and offers a free hand to anyone who might wish us ill.","Fri, 08 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/GettyImages-166164669mini.jpg,"['chinese', 'policy', 'reason', 'future', 'middle', 'influence', 'need', 'emotion', 'security', 'way', 'china', 'national', 'debate', 'australia']",

About half of that will likely go into foreign property, often in the US, Canada and Australia.

Home prices have soared under foreign buying pressure, and politicians are finally admitting it.

The “waterbed effect” of money flows.

Top residential real estate brokerages in the US have been promoting US homes to investors in China for years. Brokerage firms in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries have done the same. Commissions are at stake! They have set up units in China and are partnering with Chinese real estate portals, such as Juwai.com.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, a subsidiary of HomeServices – the second largest residential brokerage in the US – entered the fray belatedly a year ago with a marketing agreement with Juwai.com “to syndicate all of its franchisees’ residential listings.”

And not just in the trophy cities on the coasts, but all of Berkshire’s listings, anywhere.

One of the properties it offers on Juwai.com today is this mansion on 8387 Ford Road, Superior Township, Michigan:

Wolf Street

Scrolling down the page of any of these listings reveals four red buttons that lead to the crux of these deals for Chinese investors (so-so translations below):

Bottom left: Guide for obtaining a US investor immigrant visa EB-5

Bottom right: Guide on how to apply for study abroad.

And these brokerage firms in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries are doing expos and conferences in China to lure investors to make the leap. This massive marketing effort in China by these firms has worked like a charm.

Juwai.com predicts, according to the Wall Street Journal, that Chinese investors will plow $1.5 trillion into assets abroad over the next decade, with about half of that going into foreign property.

The exact number of investors in China that have piled into these housing markets is still nebulous, despite some efforts locally to collect data on it. But home prices have soared under this buying pressure of foreign money, and now, after years of denying it, politicians are no longer denying it.

At first, the inflow of Chinese investor money was great and awesome. But then it turned the local markets into full-blown housing bubbles that began threatening local economies. So various levels of governments in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and elsewhere – but notably not yet in the US – have created policies to tamp down on this incoming flood of money that distorts the market. Here’s a flavor:

June 2016: The Australian state of New South Wales, where Sydney is, unveiled a 4% tax on foreign home buyers.

July 2016: The Australian state of Victoria, where Melbourne is, raised its tax on foreign home buyers from 3% to 7%.

July 2016: The Canadian province of British Columbia, where Vancouver is, introduced a 15% tax on foreign home buyers.

April 2017: The Canadian Province of Ontario, where Toronto is, announced a laundry list of measures, including a 15% tax on purchases by non-resident foreign investors.

July 2017: Disappointed with the results, New South Wales doubled its foreign buyers tax to 8%.

October 2017: New Zealand’s government unveiled plans to block foreigners from buying existing homes.

February 2018: Disappointed with the results, British Columbia raised its foreign buyers tax from 15% to 20%. It also imposed a levy of 0.5% of the property value (which will increase to 2% in 2019) on homeowners who don’t pay income tax in Canada, thus targeting non-resident investors.

All these measures produced very mixed results. Home prices are now sinking in Toronto and Sydney, but continue to rise in Vancouver and other cities. If there are ways to get around some of these policies, local facilitators will help Chinese investors find those ways.

These governments “are still at the trial-and-error stage,” Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at Zillow, told the Wall Street Journal. “They are trying to figure what works and what doesn’t.”

And there is what Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson – who, after 10 years in office, announced that he won’t seek reelection – calls the “waterbed effect of capital flooding wherever taxes are lowest and regulation is weak.” When one area tries to tamp down on the influx of foreign money, the flow simply goes somewhere else. In Canada, this is partly due to the lack of coordination between federal, provincial, and municipal governments, he told The Journal.

“It’s a complex challenge between regulating offshore investment, local real-estate practices and addressing housing supply within cities, all in sync,” he said. “The reality is that interventions take time and aren’t wholly predictable.”

House price bubbles aren’t like stock market bubbles. People don’t have to live in stocks. But they do need to live in homes. When homes get perverted into a global asset class, all kinds of things happen, including that new supply from construction can’t meet the sudden surge of financial demand from investors who might never live on those homes. Just like stock market bubbles, housing bubbles deflate. But unlike stock-market downturns, housing-market downturns wreak havoc on the real economy on a very local basis.

In Australia, foreign buyers accounted for 10% to 15% of homes under construction and account for about 5% of total residential sales. But the share of foreign buyers reached about a quarter of new-built condos in Sydney and Melbourne, according to estimates by the Reserve Bank of Australia.

“Many foreign buyers come from China, seemingly around three-quarters,” explained RBA’s head of financial stability, Jonathan Kearns, to an Australia-China property conference last November.

The package of policies were starting to have a visible effect by last November: “Purchases of new properties by foreign buyers have eased over the past year, reportedly because of stricter enforcement of Chinese capital controls and tighter access to finance for foreign buyers,” Kearns said.

In terms of new developments, investors in China purchased about $1.5 billion in residential building sites in 2017, amounting to about a third of Australia’s total building sites, according to real-estate company Knight Frank, cited by The Journal.

Among signs that Chinese investors have backed off in Australia, there’s the “waterbed effect,” with foreign money flowing to where there is less regulation: Juwai.com found, according to The Journal, that the US and Canada have lost their spots at the top of the list for Chinese buyer inquiries, replaced by Malaysia and Thailand.

Warning that its rate of melting is accelerating, scientists have urged nations to defend their shores against the flooding that is likely to ensue.

In the most complete picture of Antarctic ice sheet change to date, they found that over a quarter of century the melting in the region caused global seas to rise around 8mm.

Recommended Plastic and hazardous chemicals found in remotest parts of Antarctica

Future projections suggest this figure could rise to 15cm by the end of the century – a change that would leave coastal cities in a near constant state of flooding.

“It’s not a large number so the question I get asked most often is: why does that matter?” Professor Andrew Shepherd of the University of Leeds, who led the study. “First of all, the last time we did this assessment we concluded that the ice sheet was contributing 0.2 mm per year to sea level rise.”

“In the past five years it has stepped up to 0.6 mm per year – so that’s three times faster.”

The study was accompanied by warnings from leading scientists that the world is running out of time to save it from a changing climate.

Antarctica stores enough frozen water to raise global sea level by 58 metres and knowing how fast it is melting is of grave importance for policy makers.

Scientists used to think that Antarctica was protected from melting by warm waters because of Southern Ocean circulation acting as a kind of “thermal controller”.

However, it is increasingly clear that ice loss from West Antarctica in particular is speeding up as a result of contact between the floating ice shelves and warming ocean waters.

The new study by an international team known as the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (IMBIE) was assembled using data from 24 long-term satellite surveys of the region’s ice sheets.

Historically, the main contributors to sea level rise are melting ice from Greenland and mountain glaciers, as well as water expanding due to higher temperatures.

Although Professor Shepherd noted that ice losses from Antarctica will tend to impact northern hemisphere countries disproportionately, it is difficult to make specific predictions for the UK and other nations.

However, he said flood defences such as the Thames barrier will have to be reconsidered as new predictions emerge about the future sea level rise.

“I think 15 cm of sea level rise is a significant concern,” he said.

He added: “If you look at coastal cities like New York or San Francisco it tends to flood there when high tides coincide with storm conditions.""

Noting that such floods occur roughly once every year, he said: “If you raise the level by 15 cm in San Francisco it will flood 20 times a year if you don’t do anything to the sea wall, and 20 times a year in New York.”

Professor Chris Rapley, a climate scientist at University College London who was not involved in the study, said the work provided a valuable insight into the melting of Antarctica.

He compared the region to a “slumbering giant awakening” that could soon rival other sources of sea level rise.

Professor Martin Siegert, co-Director of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College, who was also not involved in the research, added: “Unfortunately, we appear to be on a pathway to substantial ice-sheet loss in the decades ahead, with longer term consequences for enhanced sea-level rise.

“If we aren't already alert to the dangers posed by climate change, this should be an enormous wake-up call.”

Professor Michiel van den Broeke of Utrecht University, a member of the IMBIE team, said that while preparations for flooding are already underway in his native Netherlands, news about Antarctica would force policy makers to “recalibrate” these plans.

Their IMBIE study appeared in the journal Nature alongside a series of studies looking at the past and future of Antarctica in a changing climate, including work looking at the impact of storms on the deterioration of ice shelves.

In a one of these papers, Professor Siegert and his colleagues presented two future scenarios in which Antarctica is either protected from or exposed to unrestricted greenhouse gas emissions and exploitation.

“Antarctic is being affected by global warming, and unless we curtail our carbon dioxide emissions within the next decade, and have a zero carbon economy within a few decades, we will be locked into substantial global changes, including those in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean,” he said.","Wed, 13 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/13/17/antarctic-iceberg.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['significant', 'faster', 'doesnt', 'major', 'journey', 'study', 'coastal', 'threat', 'antarctica', 'ice', 'sea', 'cities', 'change', 'posing', 'climate', 'melting', 'believe', 'level', 'photographs']",

A lone man stood defiantly before a row of tanks near China's Tiananmen Square 29 years ago Tuesday. And while images of the anonymous ""Tank Man"" remain iconic in the West, China tightly censors all such reminders of its deadly crackdown on protestors in 1989.

But that hasn't stopped one Chinese artist from urging Tank Man's remembrance: In days leading to the demonstration's anniversary, images appeared on social media under the hashtags ""#tankman"" and ""#tankman2018"": People stood firm and held shopping bags — just as the Tank Man did nearly three decades ago.

The Chinese cartoonist known as Badiucao launched a campaign calling for performances honoring Tank Man around the world, donning his black-and-white outfit and standing on a raised platform to connect the moment's legacy to current events.



""Tank Man has been a visual totem for protests of China since 1989. But it is also fading away due to brutal censorship and sophisticated propaganda from the Chinese government,"" Badiucao, who now lives in Australia, said on his website. ""The only way to keep it alive is to represented it creatively and bring the figure relevant to what is happening contemporarily.""

In one series of images, Zhou Fengsuo, a student leader during the 1989 protests, poses as Tank Man before the U.S. Capitol and the Washington Monument. One photo, posted June 3, shows a woman before the Goddess of Victory, a statue of which Tiananmen Square protestors crafted in before soldiers destroyed it.

Others posed in everyday locations: living rooms, sidewalks and nondescript streets. Some wore masks of Guy Fawkes, the British conspirator. One small girl posed next to a plush Winnie-the-Pooh, the character banned in China as a mocking symbol of President Xi Jinping.

China's state media and officials made no mention of the Tiananmen Square anniversary Monday, The Guardian reported, and users of the popular WeChat app were even blocked from sending money amounts alluding to the June 4 date of the crackdown, such as 64.89 yuan.

The Tank Man made his stand on June 5, the morning after soldiers moved violently against pro-democracy protestors who had spent weeks peacefully demonstrating in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, a space much like Washington, D.C.'s National Mall. China officially estimated the death toll at 246. Other counts put it at 2,600.

The identity of the Tank Man remains unclear, as does his fate. Only a handful of photographers captured the moment, which China has worked to suppress while beefing up police presence around the square on the protests' anniversary.

29 years on. Find your expression, treasure it. Be on truth’s side. // Something my grandma recently said shook me. ‘Why would someone want to go against a “strong” country like China?’ I don’t know, perhaps not everyone is fond of bullies. .

The move followed several days of massive protests sparked by concerns the bill would invite what demonstrators believe would be a dangerous level of Chinese investment.



The bill would allow foreigners, mostly Chinese investors, to lease land for up to 99 years in three special economic zones. The National Assembly had been discussing the bill since November.



Protesters worried that 99-year leases would ""pave the way"" for Chinese influence, said Trung Nguyen, international relations dean at Ho Chi Minh University of Social Sciences and Humanities. ""They think that the government can be bought by Chinese, and that's the problem,"" he said.



""If you look at surveys of people in Vietnam, the average Vietnamese person is less receptive to Chinese influence than to influence from pretty much anywhere else, and the stuff going on in the South China Sea doesn't help,"" said Maxfield Brown, senior associate with the consultancy Dezan Shira & Associates in Ho Chi Minh City.



Vietnamese resent China over territorial disputes going back centuries, most recently a border war in the 1970s and an ongoing maritime sovereignty spat. Both claim the same parts of the resource-rich South China Sea.

One proposed special economic zone lies near the Chinese border. All three may be geared toward tourism investment rather than Vietnam's normal economic staple manufacturing, said Frederick Burke, partner with the law firm Baker McKenzie in Ho Chi Minh City.



""I don't think it's really focused on manufacturing, investment and supply chain stuff as such,"" Burke said. ""This is something different.""



Chinese tourists to Vietnam numbered about four million last year, up 49 percent over 2016, China's official Xinhua News Agency said. They have a reputation for booking hotel rooms in bulk, sometimes effectively barring tourists from Russia, Europe and North America, Burke said.



Beijing has also sighted Vietnam for its 65-country Belt-and-Road Initiative, auguring investment in infrastructure that would stoke trade with China. China is already planning a high-speed rail line to the Vietnamese border. Chinese money accounts for 6.8 percent of Vietnam's foreign direct investment.



Economic setback



The legislative bill neither specified China nor proposed incentives for Chinese investors, Brown said. But officials felt they needed to work with the protesters, analysts say. So on Monday 87 percent of the National Assembly lawmakers agreed to delay debate on the bill until a plenary session in October.



""Now they are doing something like taking a step back, because the protest is like a surprise to them,"" Nguyen said. ""They (could) not evaluate the scale of the protest and the intensity of the protest.""



The lease provision of the bill will be revised, Vietnam's Tuoi Tre News website said. ""I think they can compromise a little bit,"" Nguyen said.



The bill would find more public support if the special economic zones could spark interest by non-Chinese investors in leasing the land, Brown said.



Special economic zones ""need to be globally attractive,"" said Adam McCarty, chief economist with Mekong Economics in the capital Hanoi. They might include tax breaks and utility discounts for investors as well as lease deals. China has opened dozens of zones since 1979 to stimulate growth.



""The important things about SEZs are, firstly, that they should not be a net annual financial drain on the state and, secondly, they should not distract the national government from improving the overall doing business environment in the country,"" McCarty said.","Wed, 13 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/A1AB31F4-7DDC-4D63-9274-391CA974D498.jpg,"['bill', 'vietnam', 'chinese', 'protests', 'halts', 'special', 'investments', 'zones', 'protesters', 'china', 'vietnams', 'debate', 'south', 'economic']",

Beijing’s islands-building in the South China Sea and their militarization, replete with surface-to-air missiles, is near complete. With guile, threat, and coercion, China can now seize control of one of the main transport arteries of Southeast Asia, making a mockery of international laws and norms.

But there is another prize in Beijing’s sights, an artery that runs straight through mainland Southeast Asia. The mighty Mekong River, which starts in China (known there as Lancang), and connects Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia, is a crucial lifeline that nourishes some 60 million people along its banks.

Control of both the South China Sea and Mekong River will strategically sandwich mainland Southeast Asia. Indeed, Beijing’s control of Southeast Asian rivers looks set to be the other half of its “salami slicing” strategy in the region.

Famine is more terrible than the sword

Controlling the Mekong River’s flow with dams along the waterway ultimately means controlling access to food, and therefore the livelihoods of tens of millions of people in downstream riparian communities. Of the hydroelectricity dams on the Mekong, the vast majority of currently installed capacity (megawatts) is in China, accounting for more than 15,000 MW. This includes a half-dozen mega-dams over 1,000 MW, including Nuozhadu dam which churns out 5,850 MW.

Together these dams can hold back 23 billion cubic metres of water, or 27 percent of the river’s annual flow between China and Thailand. Other dams in the lower Mekong are piddling by comparison, with generating capacity in the tens or low hundreds of MW.

The bottom line: Chinese dams can now regulate the Mekong’s flow.

This is even more pronounced in the dry season when the Tibetan Plateau contributes between 40 and 70 percent of the river’s flow. The impact on food and livelihoods is dramatic now, but could soon be far worse if 11 proposed mega-dams, half with some Chinese involvement, go ahead.

A recent UNESCO and Stockholm Environment Institute report suggests sediment flows in the river could reduce by up to 94 percent if the proposed dams go ahead, significantly affecting fish catches and overall river health. This will directly affect downstream riparian communities.

More worryingly, the raison d’être of the proposed dams and oft-cited promise of a crucial electricity boost for the economies of the lower Mekong has been found to be misguided. Many of the proposed lower Mekong dams will export their energy to China, and others will have direct negative impacts on the economy. It is projected that over the next 50 years, the cost for the lower Mekong basin economy will be a net negative US$7.3 billion, with Vietnam and Cambodia the worst off. The social costs could be just as astronomical.

Dams as dominoes

During a recent trip to Laos, I encountered concerns about Chinese dams being used as strategic levers, producing unannounced upstream releases of water that impact not only communities but also new downstream dams. In such a case, the downstream dams would need to immediately release water through the spillway, at best resulting in the loss of valuable generating capacity, potentially impacting electricity supply, and at worst flooding downstream villages or damaging the integrity of the dam wall.

Already many of the dams on the tributaries of the Mekong are uninformed of upstream releases in the Mekong proper, potentially affecting their own release of water by creating a flood surge when the released waters converge. One of the operators of a joint venture dam in Laos confided that there was often little or no forewarning when water from a Chinese-built upstream dam was released.

Many of these dams are Southeast Asian state–owned or involve European firms, which could further complicate matters if an incident occurred. Indeed, the release of unscheduled upstream water by Chinese-owned dams could be used to engineer a public protest against the downstream dam’s parent company. That is concerning because it turns dams into dominoes, with China at first fall.

Dams without water, or without sufficient water in their reservoirs, also disrupt economies as they are unable to supply expected electricity output. With upstream Chinese firms controlling the Mekong’s flow, it has suffered drought-like conditions attributed to the irregular flow of the river itself.

Salinization of the Mekong at its mouth in Vietnam is one example; soil erosion across the river system is another. It’s a huge problem for those that rely on the river – the Mekong Delta in Vietnam alone produces 40 percent of the country’s rice and much of the basin’s protein.

All hail Yu Shi

A much-overlooked and further source of strength in China’s control of the river system, as well as river systems across the subcontinent, is the cloud seeding project named Tianhe. The project’s stated objective is to increase rainfall by 10 billion cubic meters – 7 percent of China’s current consumption – over the Tibetan Plateau that feeds into key transboundary rivers, including the Mekong, Brahmaputra, Indus, and Salween.

The project, part of the broader artificial weather project, would seed rain to fall over the plateau and into the catchments of these rivers. This water would then be regulated by Chinese dams (see this comprehensive map), or could be redirected domestically. But as Carnegie Council’s Janos Pasztor notes, the seeding doesn’t produce rain, “it makes it happen somewhere, which means that it will not happen somewhere else”.

Controlling the weather and ensuring rain falls within China is the next step to controlling water flows to neighboring countries. In part, this is worrying because China’s current record of natural resource management is far from stellar: some 70 percent of rivers and lakes in China are polluted.

Moreover, the potential control of rainfall creates further problems. In good times it encourages countries to build electricity-generating dams, and in bad could mean downstream drought and a full-scale weaponization of water. (An excellent anecdote on this is here).

Blowing up islands

Dams and rainfall are only one part of the equation. In contrast with its islands-building in the South China Sea, China has embarked on a “Mekong River Navigation Channel Improvement Project” that involves blasting islets, rapids, and rocks in the Mekong River to create a shipping lane through the heart of mainland Southeast Asia to Laos.

The environmental and social damages, as well as a new highway for the import of Chinese products, are expected to have a net negative impact on Southeast Asian economies. As such, Bangkok is yet to yield to the project on the Thai segment of the river.

Given the current assertiveness of Beijing’s foreign policy, in the event of war this inland maritime highway would become a strategic nightmare. This, alongside the negative economic outlook for the region, provides worrying prospects for future sovereignty in mainland Southeast Asia.

Chinese tributaries of the Mekong

Unsurprisingly, Southeast Asian states and other concerned parties have long tried to bring China to the table to establish appropriate rules for cooperation.

Others, such as Australia, must move away from the cavalier “Xi’ll be right mate” attitude.

The Mekong River Commission, established in 1995, aimed to do just that. Beijing dragged its feet, frustrating the cooperative body where it could. In 2016, in line with Beijing’s current my-way-or-the-highway style of diplomacy, it launched its own group.

The Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) has bullied states into working together. As a carrot for Southeast Asian states’ participation in the first LMC in March 2016, Beijing released water to drought-stricken downstream countries.

The threat was implicit: China controls the river. This notion is the antecedent to conflict, not cooperation.

These concerns over the Mekong and other rivers, and their place in China’s geopolitical strategy, are not new (see some excellent long-form reading here, here, and here). But today we seem to be at a tipping point, to which the region must respond.

Southeast Asian states, which are all set to lose, must find greater unity among themselves. European partners in Mekong River dams should explore alternative projects to supply energy. Others, such as Australia, must move away from the cavalier “Xi’ll be right mate” attitude, and with a concert of fair-minded friends support new energy alternatives and sustainability initiatives to boost resilience in mainland Southeast Asia.

China’s growing control over the Mekong is a crucial component of immobilizing sovereignty in mainland Southeast Asia. It must be appropriately addressed and discouraged.

The results suggest coastal development and climate change, both of which are known to be destroying the world’s coral, could have the knock on effect of subjecting people to more floods.

Reefs serve as natural breakwaters that reduce flooding by dampening waves and breaking them early.

However, their capacity to do this is severely hampered if the corals that form them are degraded, and in a study published in the journal Nature Communications scientists predicted the flooding outcomes if the top one metre of coral reef is lost.

Overall, the scientists predicted annual damages from flooding will double if these trends continue – an increase of $4bn (£3bn).

Island nations like Indonesia, Philippines and Cuba have the most to gain from reef management, with annual expected flood savings exceeding $400m each.

“We built the best global coastal flooding model and then we added reefs to estimate flood risk overall and the benefits provided by these habitats,” said Professor Íñigo Losada, from the University of Cantabria.

“This represents the first global application of a coastal protection model that probabilistically estimates risk and the benefits of coastal ecosystems.”

If coupled with sea level rise, the scientists found that flooding in the absence of coral would likely quadruple.

“Unfortunately, we are already losing the height and complexity of shallow reefs around the world, so we are likely already seeing increases in flood damages along many tropical coastlines,"" said Dr Michael Beck, lead marine scientist at The Nature Conservancy.

“Our national economies are normally only valued by how much we take from nature.

“For the first time, we can now value what every national economy gains in flood savings by conserving its coral reefs every year.”

✕ Extent of hurricane damage to coral reefs revealed by scientists

Coral bleaching events caused by global warming have led to massive “die-offs” in recent years on the Great Barrier Reef.

Globally, the threat posed by climate change is compounded by growing human threats such as coastal development, sand and coral mining, and destructive fishing practices.

The study suggests that tropical storms that have devastated coastlines in recent years such as Hurricanes Irma and Maria and Typhoon Haiyan would have been far worse in the absence of coral reefs acting as buffers.

“Coral reefs are living ecosystems that can recover if they are well managed, and this study identifies why and where we should find the needed support for restoration and management,” said Dr Beck.

“It is our hope that this science will lead to action and greater stewardship of reefs around the world.”

The researchers said their findings should offer a financial incentive to world governments to invest in coral reef conservation in order to prevent future storm damage.

“These estimates make a compelling case for present-day spending on reef management without assuming that reefs will disappear altogether under a business as usual scenario - nor do they rely on just rare, large storms,” said Dr Borja Reguero, a researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

“Better valuations of the benefits provided by coastal habitats like coral reefs, provided in terms familiar to decision makers, can help decision makers recognise the value and ensure the protection of these critical habitats and their services.”","Tue, 12 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/12/17/flood-wave.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['change', 'climate', 'world', 'storms', 'doesnt', 'coastal', 'damage', 'coral', 'believe', 'say', 'photographs', 'flood', 'scientists', 'reefs', 'flooding', 'globally', 'double']",

In August 2017, seven months into the most reactionary U.S. presidency of modern times, Donald Trump ventured into the political minefield that Washington has named the “AfPak” region, accusing Pakistan of hindering efforts to establish a lasting peace in Afghanistan and the region at large. Trump then reaffirmed his predecessor’s commitment to deepening ties with South Asia’s preeminent power, India. The Pakistani government, media, and intelligentsia reacted sharply, incensed both at Washington’s “do more” mantra and the continuing U.S. tilt toward their archrivals in New Delhi.

A little over a month later, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis upped the ante further by questioning the legality of China’s much-hyped One Belt One Road (OBOR) project, warning that the planned infrastructure-building initiative would pass through what India considers the “disputed territories” of Kashmir and Gilgit-Balistan, where the borders of China, India, and Pakistan meet. This time the retort came from Beijing, which called on other countries to join their regional cooperation agreements instead of perceiving them as a threat.

Three hundred years after what became known in the nineteenth century as the Great Game—a struggle for regional hegemony between the British and Russian Empires—Southwest Asia remains an imperial staging ground. By the middle of the twentieth century, with the collapse of European colonial empires, the United States and the Soviet Union had taken over the mantle of the world’s Great Powers, and Southwest Asia emerged as one of the major theatres of the Cold War. The collapse of the USSR ushered in a period of virtually unchallenged U.S. hegemony in the region, with China still cast as a “developing country” harboring only modest geopolitical aspirations.

The U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in September 2001 signaled Washington’s desire to cement its hegemonic position, but seventeen years later it is mired in an unwinnable war, even as the U.S. economy—and that of much of the Western world—endures the “endless crisis” of contemporary capitalism.1 At the same time, China’s economic power and political influence have grown steadily, and over the next decade the country is widely predicted to overtake the United States as the world’s largest economy. Today the globalized world order born after the demise of twentieth-century Communism is in the throes of profound change. In much of the Western political mainstream, neoliberal doctrines of globalization have been overtaken by parties and programs demanding a turn inward. The clamor barely masks the protracted decline of Western hegemony, and attendant shifts in the global balance of power.

Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which has long been known to understate its ambitions, has in recent years begun to acknowledge its global designs far more openly. This was made clear in the grandest of ways in May 2017, at a high-level summit in Beijing to mark the formal launch of OBOR, which will see a wave of Chinese-funded infrastructure projects initiated in many parts of Asia and Africa. While Trump and his neofascist counterparts fearmonger about the perils of “openness” and “globalism,” Chinese premier Xi Jinping has announced his country’s intention to lead the world into a new “golden age” of globalization.2

There has been much controversy on the left over the extent to which China’s remarkable transformation from an insular backwater to the center of the world-system represents a counterweight to capitalist imperialism. I do not engage here with the question of China’s own development trajectory per se, which has become a subject of debate even within China itself, most recently at the CCP’s Nineteenth Congress.3 Samir Amin has in any case argued that a full understanding of China’s “sovereign” path requires a rejection of a simple “capitalism vs. socialism” binary and of the prevailing trend toward “China bashing.”4

The most notable international impact of China’s growth has been its stunning emergence since the 1990s as the workshop of the global economy. For thirty years, Chinese manufactures have flooded world markets, a success made possible by its seemingly inexhaustible supplies of cheap labor. However, rising labor costs (and worker unrest), along with falling aggregate demand in Western economies, have confirmed to the CCP that the country is entering a new phase of accumulation, one that will facilitate the transition to a service-oriented economy and focus developmental efforts on western China. Among other initiatives, excess capacity will be channeled into massive communication thoroughfares linking both the western regions and the rest of mainland China to Southwest and Central Asia.

Arguably the most significant single element in Beijing’s calculus for the region—and certainly OBOR’s biggest component—is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In this essay, I will interrogate what China’s flagship globalization project means for Pakistan, and how to evaluate China’s growing footprint in the country, given Pakistan’s central place in U.S. imperial strategy in Southwest Asia for much of the postwar period. By distinguishing official CPEC rhetoric from reality, we can better evaluate the degree to which China’s role as an emergent global superpower challenges not only U.S. hegemony, but capitalist imperialism itself.

The debate over China’s emergence as a world power often ignores specific national and regional contexts, particularly those where Western imperialist nations have long-established interests. In recent years, OBOR-funded developments in Africa have become the subject of critical study on the left.5 Here I will consider whether CPEC is likely to reinforce class and state power within Pakistan, and what kind of larger developmental and ecological vision the project advances. Only by studying such on-the-ground effects—rather than abstractly hypothesizing whether China’s will be an “anti-imperialist” intervention by virtue of its displacing the United States—can we gain real insights into the trajectory of the world order in the coming decades, and specifically the future of working people and fragile ecosystems in the historically imperialized zones of the global South.

Trump’s announcement last August that Pakistan would be held to account for its alleged duplicity in the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan was followed by even more incendiary finger-pointing in subsequent months.6 In contrast, China has generally appeared to stand by Pakistan, thus reinforcing the belief that the country should move further away from a bullying Washington, into Beijing’s ever-expanding orbit. Even before Trump’s latest outburst, the CPEC project was widely hailed as a “game-changer” in Pakistani intellectual and political circles, notwithstanding the exceedingly limited public discussion of the plan itself.7

Outside the mainstream, however, Beijing’s growing power is a far more contested matter. CPEC has sparked considerable conflict within the small Pakistani left, with discernible pro-China and anti-China positions emerging. As I suggest below, both perspectives shed light on imperialism in Pakistan, as well as on the state, class, ethnicity, and other social fault lines. By mapping this history, it becomes possible to envision a meaningful anti-imperialist politics in Pakistan in the years to come.

Pakistan: Frontline of Imperialism

Since the events of 9/11 and the subsequent “war on terror,” Pakistan has arguably been the single most important country in U.S. foreign policy calculus. The U.S. military adventure in Afghanistan against the Taliban has been facilitated by successive Pakistani regimes, starting with the military rule of General Pervez Musharraf (1999–2008). Yet since shortly after the opening of the Afghan theatre, Washington has accused Pakistan of playing a “double game” by providing covert support to some Taliban factions, most notably the Haqqani Network.

The current love-hate U.S.-Pakistan relationship is to a significant extent a microcosm of the two countries’ ties through much of the postwar era. Pakistan remained central to U.S. imperial designs for most of the Cold War, despite their starkly different motivations for investing in bilateral relations. Washington saw Pakistan as a key member of its anticommunist alliances in Southwest Asia, namely the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization, or Baghdad Pact. Bilateral aid began with the so-called Mutual Assistance Program in 1954, through which the United States provided resources and training to the Pakistani army, seeking to modernize it as a fighting force, and more generally to shape the new nation into a pliant third-world state along Huntingtonian lines.8 For its part, Pakistan, which after a military coup in 1958 had embraced its colonial inheritance as a garrison of Western imperialism, saw the alliance as a means of offsetting its relative weakness vis-à-vis a much bigger and better endowed India.

The contradictions of this uneasy alignment were exposed after the Sino-Indian border conflict erupted in 1962. Routed by the more professional and modern Red Army, New Delhi looked to Washington for help, and its request was promptly heeded by the Kennedy administration. Feeling betrayed by Washington’s overtures to Jawaharlal Nehru’s left-leaning Congress Party, the military regime in Islamabad headed by General Ayub Khan turned its attention to Beijing, laying the foundations of a Sino-Pakistani nexus and confirming the complex geopolitical calculus of the Cold War in South Asia.

However, China’s “all-weather friendship,” as it came to be known in Islamabad, could not offset fallout from the Pakistani military establishment’s India-centric strategic policy. When New Delhi decisively intervened in east Pakistan’s civil war in late 1971, neither Beijing nor Washington was willing to directly support the Pakistani army’s floundering Operation Searchlight against Bengali insurgents. The country’s eastern wing seceded to form the state of Bangladesh, and Pakistan’s strategic defeat reached its humiliating conclusion.

In the immediate aftermath, Pakistan’s foreign policy briefly approximated non-alignment. A left-of-center regime headed by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto claimed to represent a third-world popular-nationalist project, and for a time threatened to overturn a history of unconditional allegiance to larger powers. In the event, Bhutto’s first significant initiative was to facilitate Washington’s reestablishment of formal diplomatic ties with China, thus bringing together both of Islamabad’s major allies and confirming that Pakistan would remain firmly on the anti-Soviet side of the Cold War divide.9

Indeed, just a few years later, Pakistan became the staging ground for one of Washington’s most consequential anti-Soviet interventions, the “jihad” against the Moscow-backed People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan. By then Bhutto had been overthrown—and later hanged—by General Zia ul Haq, thus ushering in yet another military dictatorship backed by the United States. Pakistan had once again become Washington’s blue-eyed boy, while jihadi militants were depicted as warriors serving the cause of freedom and democracy, helping defang the “evil empire.”

The blowback from this anti-Soviet jihad has since engulfed much of the world. Right-wing millenarian ideology has taken deep root both in sections of majority-Muslim societies as well as among some disaffected Muslims in Western countries. The growing influence of religious militancy amongst Muslim populations is nevertheless far from an unchanging cultural fact. While Trump’s sheer demagoguery confirms the growing power of the far right, it is worth recalling that it was neoconservatives under George W. Bush who initiated a new phase of U.S. militarism under the guise of fighting radical Islam, fueling the “clash of civilizations” narrative from which reactionary forces in Muslim contexts have also benefited.

The shift in U.S. foreign policy toward direct confrontation with its erstwhile jihadi protégés, with Afghanistan again a major theatre of bloody conflict, has tested relations between the United States and Pakistan’s military establishment. The latter has sought at one and the same time to maintain a relationship with its overlords in the Pentagon, and to continue patronizing those jihadi groups that serve its longstanding strategic objectives in India and Afghanistan.

Even accounting for the opportunism of Pakistan’s generals, Washington’s convenient insistence, both before and during the Trump presidency, that Pakistan is the “epicenter of global terrorism” betrays the utterly contradictory effects of unbridled U.S. militarism. Delusions of grandeur notwithstanding, a U.S.-dominated global economy is now a thing of the past, with American working and even middle-class populations devastated by deindustrialization and financialization—the “endless crisis” exploited in the xenophobic idiom of Trump and his ilk. Although the U.S. dollar for now remains the global reserve currency, U.S. imperial power is sustained primarily by its enormous military capacity and the attendant ideology of unending war peddled by its military-industrial complex and a compliant corporate media.

China as New Patron Saint?

Against this backdrop of bloated militarism, Washington’s increasingly strained relations with Islamabad contrast sharply with the cordiality of the Sino-Pakistani relationship. Effusive and mutual praise has flowed freely since the two countries became close allies more than fifty years ago—although only in recent times has China emerged as a genuine competitor to the United States as Pakistan’s major benefactor.

Beijing has unfailingly supplied weapons to Islamabad for the better part of five decades, and its support was critical to the development of Pakistan’s nuclear program in the 1980s and early 1990s. Yet even China’s steadfast support during periods of strain between Pakistan and the United States has not lured Pakistani generals away from higher-quality U.S. weapons as part of their long-term efforts to modernize the county’s military. In fact, the ebbs and flows in the relationship between Washington and Islamabad have never translated into a complete freeze in arms sales and technical support from the Pentagon to the Pakistan army’s General Headquarters (GHQ).

At the same time, U.S. aid to Pakistan has never included a substantial economic component—at least not consistently so—and it is on this front that China’s evolving role is likely to prove distinct. While economic cooperation between China and Pakistan has increased considerably since the turn of the millennium, Beijing’s stakes in the Pakistani economy are set to increase exponentially in the form of CPEC commitments: to date the Chinese government has pledged more than $54 billion.

The question, as ever, is whether CPEC will simply buttress Pakistan’s inegalitarian and authoritarian power structure, or if, instead, Chinese intervention will trigger incipient forces of change, even if unwittingly. So far the only detailed material available in the public domain about CPEC is the so-called Long-Term Plan (LTP), a Chinese government document finalized in December 2015 by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the China Development Bank. The LTP in its original form is over 250 pages long; a greatly abridged version of only 36 pages was released to the public in December 2017, simply to stave off growing criticism about a lack of transparency – secrecy, even – in CPEC-related matters.

Public relations gimmicks notwithstanding, the original document confirms Beijing’s longer-term objectives in Pakistan, meticulously outlining plans for cooperation between both governments to attract increased investment by Chinese companies in Pakistani industry, agriculture, coastal tourism, communications infrastructure, and water resources. While the document makes boilerplate overtures to Pakistan’s economic and social development, it can on the whole be read as a not very subtle assertion of China’s regional interests—especially the drive to gain market access for Chinese firms and develop China’s vast western interior via the transportation routes to be built under the CPEC plan.

Of particular note is the document’s emphasis on modernizing Pakistan’s agricultural heartland in central Punjab, which contradicts the vague claims by Pakistani officialdom and intelligentsia that CPEC is primarily about stimulating the country’s manufacturing industries. As far as China is concerned, Pakistan’s comparative advantage is in agriculture, and improving infrastructure and technical expertise while reducing waste in the sector will directly complement the modernization of agriculture in Xinjiang and other parts of western China. In the context of the CCP’s relatively undisguised policy of promoting migration by Han Chinese to the underdeveloped and sparsely populated western provinces, some of which have become hotbeds of minority unrest, the utility of Pakistan’s agricultural sector becomes even clearer.

As conceived in the plan, Beijing’s chief reciprocal contribution to Pakistan’s development would come from Chinese companies operating in the telecommunications, energy, and household appliances sectors. The resulting boost to a burgeoning domestic market of ostensibly middle-class consumers has been touted time and again as a virtual panacea for Pakistan’s development needs, recalling the remedies all too often outlined in standard neoliberal policy prescriptions.

In fact, Chinese goods and services started to flood the Pakistani market long before the CPEC initiative was announced, especially after a free trade agreement between the two countries was signed in July 2007. The total value of bilateral trade surged from just over $1 billion in the early 2000s to more than $16 billion by 2016. Wholesalers and retailers handling the influx of Chinese goods have undoubtedly benefited, but local industry has been throttled. Some manufacturers have survived by moving production abroad, to the detriment of Pakistan’s already immiserated industrial working class; more than 20,000 jobs have been slashed in the shoe-manufacturing sector alone.10

Pakistan’s Federal Chamber of Commerce has demanded that local businesses be given access to the Industrial Parks and Export Processing Zones conceived in the CPEC plan, but there is little evidence to suggest that Pakistani manufacturers will prove competitive enough to reverse established trends. The only “successful” local companies in recent years have partnered with Chinese manufacturers to shift at least part of the latter’s operations to Pakistan—but in doing so, they have helped push out other domestic firms that cannot offer cut-price production to Chinese businesses. In effect, the Pakistani bourgeoisie has become even more of a comprador class than when it operated exclusively as the middleman for the imported goods of Japanese zaibatsus and Western multinationals.

The business-friendly Pakistan Muslim League–Nawaz (PML–N) government, in power since 2013, has made much noise about fixing the country’s longstanding energy crisis, a major cause of stagnation in the manufacturing sector. The government has promised that chronic electricity shortfalls will be resolved once and for all by the numerous power plants envisaged under the CPEC plan. Yet there is no sign that power blackouts, popularly known as “load shedding” in Pakistan, will end anytime soon, and new power plants being built under the CPEC plan will likely only reinforce the competitive advantage that Chinese firms already wield over their local counterparts.

As for the prospect of Chinese investment generating employment for a rapidly increasing Pakistani population—now over 200 million, with more than 60 percent under the age of twenty-five—the evidence to date is clear. Chinese firms have acquired a reputation for bringing most of their employees with them, from highly skilled engineers to construction workers. In the Mansehra district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, site of some of the most intensive road-building works initiated under the CPEC plan, thousands of Chinese engineers and laborers work and live in relative isolation from the local population, with only a specially designated Pakistani military unit allowed access to both the construction site and the nearby housing settlement.

While officials insist that CPEC has already generated an employment boom, the only concrete evidence of job creation is in the armed forces. A special security force of at least 15,000 operating under army command has been raised to protect CPEC instalments and Chinese personnel who, by keeping almost entirely to themselves, reinforce the perception that they are insular outsiders who want only access to the country’s resources, hardly endearing themselves to local populations.11

A Divided Left

This special military force was conceived after the CCP made clear that CPEC would be initiated only if the Pakistani government could guarantee the safety of Chinese investments, engineers, and workers. High-profile kidnappings and even murders of Chinese citizens working in Pakistan have been reported for some years, particularly in the resource-rich but insurgency-wracked province of Balochistan in the southwest. The Chinese government has accordingly appeared to support the intensification of counter-insurgency operations by the Pakistani army against secular Baloch separatists.

Meanwhile, Beijing is concerned with militancy of a decidedly non-secular variety in Xinjiang, where Islamists have cultivated pockets of support among the Uyghurs, a Turkic minority group that has long harbored fears of cultural and economic subjugation by the Han Chinese majority. A similar perception exists within the Baloch ethnic group, which for decades has resisted the oppressive rule of a Punjabi-dominated Pakistani state. Not surprisingly, CPEC is viewed as yet another state-sponsored attempt to rob the Baloch people of their resources in the guise of “development.”

The crown jewel in the CPEC plan is a deep-sea port opened in November 2016 in the once-sleepy fishing village of Gwadar, on the westernmost tip of Balochistan. The construction of Gwadar Port has been viewed with great suspicion by at least a segment of Baloch nationalists, who consider the project an extension of Islamabad’s longstanding economic colonialism. Moreover, they believe that Gwadar—and CPEC in general—will accelerate incipient demographic trends in Balochistan that are fast turning ethnic Baloch into a minority in their own land.

For China, Gwadar is a warm-water port offering the isolated cities of its western provinces a window to the world. Kashgar, the largest town on China’s western border, is more than 1,200 miles from Gwadar, but more than 3,100 miles from Shanghai, on China’s eastern seaboard. The development of Gwadar thus clearly serves China’s medium-term objectives. Whether it suits the Baloch people, or Pakistan’s working masses more generally is a matter of much greater contention.

CPEC has intensified longstanding divisions within the embattled Pakistani left, which has struggled to come to terms with what CPEC signifies, especially in light of Pakistan’s status as a frontline state of U.S. imperialism. While such thorny debates among left activists and intellectuals are in part a hangover from Cold War factionalism, distinct perspectives on the growing Chinese footprint in Pakistan have emerged in recent years. A closer look at these arguments offers considerable insights into a complex country and region where the geopolitical stakes are extremely high.

On one side is the fairly straightforward hypothesis that China’s growing power represents a counterweight to Washington’s seventy-year influence in Pakistan. In this argument, Beijing—and other capitals, like Moscow, that are reasserting themselves in the region—appears as an ally of anti-imperialists in the country, and the CPEC plan as concrete evidence that Chinese aid can address Pakistan’s development needs, in contrast to the narrow strategic and military goals that Washington has always pursued. Extrapolated further, this argument takes on an anti-imperialist accent on a global scale, envisioning emergent political-economic blocs such as the Shanghai Cooperation Agreement and BRICS as new opportunities for countries like Pakistan to extricate themselves from the centuries-old hegemonic orbit of Western imperialist powers.

The opposing view on the left emphasizes that even if changing geopolitical dynamics do reduce Islamabad’s historical dependency on the United States, China’s intervention is far from a win-win situation for Pakistan—and, in fact, is likely to exacerbate existing class, ethnic, and ecological conflicts. Like its pro-China counterpart, this left critique is relatively simple: it holds that the CPEC only reinforces the established neoliberal paradigm, with its emphasis on corporate control and endless expansion of markets for consumer goods, even as it intensifies ecological degradation and labor exploitation, all behind the veil of “development.” A rapidly expanding urban middle class in Pakistan—which by liberal estimates could number up to 60 million people—will certainly buttress demand by indulging a Rostowian fetish for mass consumption. But what of the dark side of development, ignored by the corporate media and Chinese and Pakistani authorities—namely, the masses of dispossessed working people whose livelihoods and cultures revolve around the land, water, mountains, forests, and other natural resources that predominantly Chinese corporations are being given free rein to pillage?

Such processes of dispossession were intensifying even before the launch of CPEC, with hitherto untapped mineral resource zones in peripheral regions like Balochistan, Sindh, and Gilgit-Balitstan most affected. Balochistan, for instance, is home to the Reko Diq and Saindak mines, with some of the largest untapped copper and gold reserves in the world. CPEC will no doubt signal intensified mining of such precious metals, along with other process of extraction and accumulation that are anything but beneficial for local communities. Coal-powered energy plants being set up in the Punjabi heartland, for example, will inevitably yield significant ecological fallouts across both central and peripheral regions. By 2020, thermal power production is expected to reach more than 13,000 megawatts annually, with all but about 500 megawatts coal-fired.

It is more than a little ironic that the CCP has in recent years begun cutting back on domestic coal and steel production in an effort to make the Chinese development model more efficient and ecologically sustainable. The NDRC reported in April 2017 that China has already reduced coal and steel production by 400 million metric tons, halfway toward its planned target of 800 million by 2020. By facilitating more intensive coal production in Pakistan, China appears to be following in the footsteps of “advanced” Western countries whose partial greening of their own economies has derived in large part from shifting environmentally destructive practices to the global South.

Under CPEC, coal production in Pakistan is expected to increase enormously, with the biggest initiative planned for the Thar coalfields in eastern Sindh, reportedly home to the world’s seventh-largest coal reserve, with around 175 billion metric tons. The extraction of Thar’s coal has been promoted within Pakistan as a homegrown cure for chronic underdevelopment, and China’s financial and technical support for the project has been met with much fanfare.

In practice, even in its initial phases—actual coal production is not projected to begin until 2019—the project has already begun to displace local communities and alter the regional ecosystem. More than 9,000 square miles of Thar’s total area of 22,000 square miles will be mined for coal, while the rest will be subject to substantial damming, projects that promise to transform the lives of the region’s 150,000 people. The Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC), which is leading the development in partnership with China Power International, has launched a vigorous public relations campaign, claiming it will prioritize the hiring of local workers, compensate displaced communities, and preserve the local environment. Yet the reality in Thar is far less rosy: to take only one example, more than 70 percent of Thar’s people lack access to clean drinking water, and as coal mining intensifies, the already saline groundwater is growing contaminated and potentially poisonous.

Not surprisingly, authorities have not looked kindly on local activists’ demands for accountability. Several activists have been threatened by SECMC goons and local officials, and in August 2017 some were even forcibly disappeared by the military’s intelligence apparatus, a practice that has become almost endemic in Pakistan in recent years.

While intolerance for dissent in Pakistan is nothing new, CPEC has already acquired the status of a sacred cow. Despite serious conflicts between the PML–N government and the military establishment, there appears to be little elite disagreement over Chinese investment in the country. Pakistan’s rulers clearly do not want to antagonize their new patron-in-chief. For its part, the Chinese government has also stepped up its public relations efforts to silence the murmurs of dissent outside the mainstream. In short, to question CPEC in contemporary Pakistan, even if only to demand greater transparency around the project, is a dangerous endeavor.

The fear that Beijing will reinforce the Pakistani state’s authoritarian tendencies is not based only on circumstantial evidence or speculation. A significant section of the LTP focuses on how China will facilitate the surveillance capacities of local security agencies. The major infrastructural investment in this regard is the laying of a country-wide fiber-optic cable, which would both transform Pakistan’s communication network and give China extensive control over information flows in the country. China Mobile already accounts for 20 percent of domestic telecommunications traffic, and this share is projected to increase dramatically in the near future. Meanwhile, the Huawei group is likewise acquiring monopoly-like dominance over the digital technology and hardware markets.

The LTP also makes no secret of China’s plan to use communications networks, including digital television channels, to disseminate Chinese culture in Pakistan, while the explosion of Mandarin-teaching institutes across the country, alongside initiatives in the realm of arts and culture, reflects Beijing’s desire to project China’s power in new ways.

It is against this backdrop that left debates over China’s increasingly hegemonic role in Pakistan’s polity and economy must be understood. To a significant extent, these differences revolve around the question of the Pakistani state, and particularly the army. There is a palpable sense that China’s interventions will empower the coercive arm of the state and further constrict democratic space in the country, particularly in the historically oppressed peripheral regions outside the Punjab.

The debate also reflects a broader controversy over “development” itself. While some on the left have stayed true to a “stageist” Marxism which considers a certain level of capitalist industrialization a necessary evil in the protracted struggle for socialism, others see no progressive potential in the Chinese-supported incarnation of the Pakistani bourgeoisie, and view CPEC as hardly challenging the contemporary regime of global capital, with all its economic, ecological, and political crises.

To be sure, the displacement of local communities in Sindh due to the Thar coal project is only the latest example of forced migration in Pakistan, which has steadily increased over the past few years amid worsening ecological and political catastrophes. The “war on terror” has forced millions of Pakhtuns on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border to flee their homes for cities like Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi, where they are condemned to poverty, squalor, and discrimination. Meanwhile the realities of climate change have come to the fore for numerous village communities in Siraiki and Sindhi regions in the heart of the Indus Basin which have been devastated by monsoon floods almost annually since 2010. The mass exodus that follows each episode has exacerbated the already explosive pressure on urban centers unable to meet the demand for either gainful employment or basic needs like housing and sanitation.

Of course, these longer-term trends cannot be attributed to the Chinese footprint in Pakistan per se. But there can be little doubt that CPEC will reinforce existing pressures on already vulnerable ecosystems while forcing ever more displaced communities into the ranks of the largely unseen and dispossessed masses, both in the rural hinterlands and major metropolitan areas. All this while the prevailing technocratic developmental imaginary—to which all contenders for political power in Pakistan subscribe—lavishes its attention solely on a mythical middle class, serviced by Chinese corporations.

Whether new political projects can confront this crisis of political imagination and organization in an era of near-total neoliberal hegemony is certainly not a challenge unique to the Pakistani left. Unfortunately, existing divisions in left circles have to date prevented this difficulty from even being acknowledged with any degree of coherence. Insofar as certain left factions view China’s growing role in Pakistan as unequivocally beneficial, based on a rather facile mapping of the shift from the unipolar post-1991 world order to an increasingly multipolar present, they draw a distinct line between themselves and those on the left working in peripheral zones among historically oppressed ethnic groups. If the left ignores these regions and communities where neoliberal development and war generates untold misery and ecological destruction, it risks delegitimizing the very essence of the socialist project.

Conclusion

U.S. imperialism has played an unambiguously destructive role in Pakistan for most of the country’s seventy-year history. Aside from decisively empowering the military establishment, its support of religious militancy in the 1980s precipitated a complete transformation of the body politic. The secular political traditions of other societies in the region were similarly undermined by the rise of millenarianism, with Afghanistan worst affected. Today Washington seeks to maintain its waning influence in the region through a zero-sum strategic game that has seen India, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan pitted against one another, forcing their own people to bear the cost.

In this context, China’s claim to advance a development agenda that transcends the narrow geopolitical calculus that has long defined regional dynamics should be evaluated carefully. The biggest question mark in the OBOR strategy in South Asia remains Beijing’s frosty relations with New Delhi. Still, the volume of official trade between China and India totaled almost $71 billion in 2016—nearly six times that between China and Pakistan. Thus economic ties are expanding despite the Modi government’s nationalist posturing. In any case, China’s growing economic and political role in the region necessarily means that the era of Washington’s unrivalled hegemony, especially in its longtime frontline state of Pakistan, has ended.

Yet the discussion above confirms the danger that China’s emergent hegemony represents more of the same for Pakistan’s long-suffering people, especially those from historically underrepresented ethnic groups. There has also been little evidence so far that the ideal of building an “ecological civilization” that has gained credence in China in recent years is anything more than an afterthought when it comes to Chinese investments in Pakistan.12

Even if one takes the rather blunt metric of CPEC financing, the rhetoric is far removed from reality. Of the $28 billion injected into Pakistan’s economy by late 2016 through CPEC’s “early harvest” projects, $19 billion was in the form of commercial loans. In the not-too-distant future, this portends yearly debt repayments of more than $3.5 billion.13 It is not at all clear, then, that China offers a financial alternative to the International Monetary Fund/World Bank juggernaut that has already saddled Pakistan with a foreign debt burden approaching $80 billion.

Perhaps most importantly, China’s seemingly apolitical developmental intervention is consolidating the existing structure of power in Pakistan, and in particular the military establishment that Washington helped make into the country’s dominant force. Recent events suggest China is exerting some pressure on Pakistan’s GHQ to break with the religious militants long used as proxies against India and Afghanistan.14 This would make sense, given China’s commitment to expanding market exchange through its infrastructural and other investments, and the attendant fear that these investments may be threatened by militant movements in Pakistan.

Even if peace were achieved overnight, however, the Chinese vision of “development” would not represent a genuine and sustainable alternative to neoliberal development practices as they have been institutionalized around the world. China’s intervention in Pakistan thus cannot be considered the progressive “other” to the destructive militarism—both state and non-state—that U.S. imperialism and domestic elites have imposed on Southwest Asia for decades.

China’s larger-than-life role and the real material consequences of its global expansion are in fact reinforcing anxieties about the extent to which the Chinese challenge to U.S. hegemony can move the planet and its people toward a post-capitalist future. If the rosy rhetoric about the CPEC project does not translate into an environmentally sustainable reality, one that makes Pakistan more egalitarian and just, little hope will remain that China can lead the world into a new era of peace, prosperity, and ecological harmony that transcends the rule of capital.

41,41,FL-2018-000068-CHN,Migrants Flood New Balkan Route to EU - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/europe/migrants-flood-new-balkan-route-eu,"TIRANA, ALBANIA - Numbers of migrants trying to reach Western Europe via Albania have increased dramatically this year, with people smugglers opening a new Balkan route for those fleeing conflict or poverty in the Middle East, North Africa and Asia.

Migrants gathered outside the Asylum Seekers Center in Tirana told Reuters how they wanted to find work in a variety of European Union countries, dodging police on the way.

The flow of migrants heading for EU member Croatia across Albania and its northern neighbor Montenegro remains modest compared with the hundreds of thousands who took a route further to the east when the European migration crisis peaked in 2015.

Rapid increase of migrants

But the rate of increase this year is rapid. Officials say Albanian authorities caught 2,311 migrants in the first five months, up from just 162 in January-May 2017 and more than double the figure of about 1,000 for the whole of last year.

During the 2015 crisis, migrants tried to travel from Greece through Macedonia and Serbia to EU member Hungary, until this route was sealed by border guards and fences.

With warmer weather encouraging travel from the overcrowded Greek camps, the government feels it has controlled the flow so far. However, impoverished Albania appealed last month to Austria, where the right-wing government is cracking down on migration, for help.

?Forming a response

Security and police officials from the region met in Bosnia this week to discuss their response to growing traffic along the new route. More than 5,500 refugees and migrants have entered Bosnia this year.

Albanian police said they have arrested a handful of people smugglers this year ferrying migrants in taxis or vans. This included two Algerians near the Montenegrin border this week.

The government wants aid to increase patrols on the Greek border and has welcomed a decision by the European border agency Frontex to send officers to fight crime and curb migration.

?‘Careful of Croatian police’

While the route is new, the migrants’ experiences are familiar. Syrian Faisal Grdawe, from Homs city, said he had not seen his family for a year and reached Greece from Turkey, hoping to travel to Malta or Italy.

“We have friends and family there and they said it is good. So we want to go to Malta,” Grdawe, 18, told Reuters.

Grdawe and three friends had been part of a group of 30 that left Syria. One of his friends, who gave his name as Mahir, said their stay in the asylum seekers’ center was not the freedom they sought, adding that the “food here is worse than in a jail in Syria.”

Moroccan, Algerian and Pakistani migrants said they followed advice from friends who had crossed earlier: “Go to Italy because you get ID papers there” and “Be careful of Croatian police, they beat you up badly.”

Croatian police say they are acting within the law and protecting the borders. Interior minister Davor Boznovic said more than 144 people have been detained for people smuggling this year.

Difficult route north

Flooding in southern Myanmar has caused a landslide at a famed Buddhist pagoda, submerged homes and displaced hundreds of people as monsoon rains batter the country.

Several parts of Myanmar's southern Mon state are facing flash floods due to heavy rains since the weekend with no relief in sight, according to a report in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar on Monday.

Rains triggered a landslide that damaged the hilltop Kyeik Than Lan​ pagoda, whose golden stupa towers over state capital Mawlamyine.

AFP correspondents on Monday saw workers helping to relocate Buddha statues and novice monks helping clean up debris at the religious site after a wedge of hillside slipped away.

Bo Win, a resident helping with the flood response, told AFP that around 1,000 people were sheltering in several sites around Mawlamyine.

""This is the worst flood in the state that I have ever seen,"" said Nyan Soe, another local resident.

About 150 residents further south of Mawlamyine were evacuated to a government school after dozens of homes and bridges were submerged, while a monastery was destroyed across the river from the city, the New Light reported.

So far no casualties have been reported in the state, but rains continue to pound swathes of the country.

Last week five people were killed after monsoon rains triggered a landslide in Mogok, a northern Myanmar town famed for its ruby mines.

Myanmar is one of several countries in the region to face severe yearly flooding. In 2015 it topped a global list compiled by climate scientists of nations hardest hit by extreme weather.

Wayne Ellwood on the scale of this juggernaut and its economic and political ramifications

On the remote, windswept steppes of central Asia where Kazakhstan borders China a new ‘port’ is being built – 2,500 kilometres away from the nearest ocean. The Khorgos Gateway is a massive transport hub, a ‘dry port’ rail terminal designed to process the surging flow of goods from China’s humming factories to eager customers in Asia and Europe.

Nearby is the town of Nurkent, a planned community expected to house an expected flood of 100,000 workers. Construction cranes crowd the skyline, while apartments, schools and municipal buildings rise all around.

The project is just one part of China’s visionary Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a multibillion dollar made-in-Beijing investment programme designed to bring much-needed infrastructure to half the planet.

Khorgos Gateway may be in the middle of nowhere. But that’s the attraction.

The high-tech rail terminal, which sits at the crossroads of Central Asia and Europe, is a key part of a new 21st century ‘Silk Road’ connecting China to the West. ‘One belt, one road’ was the original name given to the scheme to build a vast new network of trade routes from East to West. It has since been rebranded as the Belt and Road Initiative – which rolls off the tongue more easily but is no less opaque.

Advert

The Silk Road is a storied part of China’s imperial past, a network of overland and sea routes that linked the country to central Asia and Europe for nearly 2,000 years, before fading to irrelevance in the 19th century. Confusingly, the ‘Belt’ part of the five-year-old Belt and Road Initiative refers to the overland Silk Road while the ‘Road’ refers to the maritime route.

Under the increasingly autocratic leadership of President Xi Jinping, China is busily reviving those economic and cultural ties. At the 19th Congress of the Communist Party last year, the BRI was officially folded into the Party Constitution giving it further heft as official state policy.

Breathtaking ambition

Half the planet may sound like hyperbole but it’s not far off the mark. The goal is to boost trade, energy production, communications and transport links across Africa, Asia, Russia and the Middle East: 68 countries have signed on so far.

It is by any measure breathtaking, in both scope and ambition.

According to McKinsey management consultants, the BRI covers 65 per cent of the global population, a third of the world’s GDP and a quarter of all the goods and services traded between countries.

It’s been compared to the post-World War Two Marshall Plan when the US ploughed the equivalent of $140 billion into rebuilding European economies.

Advert

In fact that comparison is not even close.

Beijing is currently investing nearly $200 billion a year in nations that have joined the project. Most of that is in the form of soft loans channelled through state-run financial outfits like the China Development Bank, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. (The AIIB was launched by President Xi five years ago as a counterweight to the multilateral Asian Development Bank and is now a roaring success with nearly 80 members and more than $250 billion in the pot.)

In fact so many projects have been inked it’s impossible to keep track. China says a trillion dollars worth of deals are in play, most of those in energy and transport. The enormous debt taken on by shaky economies from Kazakhstan to Kenya has led to charges that Beijing is using debt as a backdoor to economic control. Sri Lanka, for example, recently handed over the deep sea port of Hambantota for 99 years to China’s Merchant Port Holdings in exchange for $1.1 billion in debt relief.

The Chinese are keen on ports. They invested $20 billion in foreign ports last year and now have controlling interests in more than 75 sea terminals around the globe – including ports in Djibouti, Brunei, Kenya, Turkey and Greece.

The China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), one of the BRI’s marquee efforts, includes the port of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea. The $62 billion transport and energy project will link Karachi to northern Pakistan and, eventually, Kashgar in southwest China. The corridor includes a 1,100 kilometre superhighway from Karachi to Lahore and a completely revamped rail network.

But the bulk of China’s BRI investment is in energy and most of that is targeted to fossil fuels, especially coal.

On the world stage China positions itself as a leader in the fight against climate change – and it is making enormous strides at reducing fossil fuel dependency inside the country.

But abroad it’s a different story. More than 200 coal plants are being developed or financed by Chinese companies. According to Boston University’s Global Development Policy Centre, a third of Chinese energy investments since 2001 ($44 billion) have been in coal, most of that in Asia and Africa where energy needs are high and environmental concerns less pressing to business elites and their political cronies. The activist group, CoalSwarm, estimates Chinese firms are involved in 16 per cent of all coal-fired power stations under construction outside China.

Pushing the surplus

More than 100 countries participated in the May 2017 Belt and Road forum in Beijing, allowing the Chinese President to position himself as a peace-loving internationalist and a positive force for economic development.

China, he stressed, wanted to revive the old ‘Silk Road Spirit’ to make economic globalization ‘open, inclusive, balanced and mutually beneficial’.

‘The Silk Road Spirit is a historic and cultural heritage shared by all countries,’ Xi intoned in his keynote speech, ‘symbolizing communication and co-operation between East and West.’

So many projects have been inked it’s impossible to keep track. China says a trillion dollars worth of deals are in play

Compared to Donald Trump’s isolationist, trade-wary regime in Washington this has a certain appeal.

But behind Xi’s soothing rhetoric there’s a hard-headed economic and geopolitical rationale for the billions China has earmarked to foreign infrastructure investment.

Beijing has an enormous global trade surplus – $425 billion in 2017 – and desperately needs to recycle its earnings beyond low-yielding US treasury bills. It also has vast excess production capacity, especially in steel and cement. Currently China can produce more than a billion metric tons of steel, twice what it needs to satisfy domestic and export demands.

The BRI will open new markets to Chinese companies and give China access to valuable raw materials for future growth. It will also spur the economy in Chinese border regions that have been mostly bypassed by booming growth on the coast over the past two decades. Strengthening financial and trading connections with neighbours and near neighbours will reinforce China’s dominant position as a counterweight to the US in the global economy. And it may help realize a long-held Chinese dream – dethroning the

US dollar, thus transforming the Chinese renminbi into the dominant global currency.

Learning from mistakes

Of course there are risks, both financial and otherwise. Many of the nations contracting BRI debt are hamstrung by despotic rulers and feeble economies. Bloomberg reports that 60 per cent of China’s partners have sovereign debt ratings of ‘junk’.

As the 500-pound gorilla in the room Beijing has to step carefully. Suspicions of China’s motives are deeply entrenched across Southeast Asia – not least in Myanmar, Malaysia and Vietnam where the nation’s super-size commercial clout and imperial history make people nervous.

There has been backlash already. In the West, Washington has slammed China for ‘unfair trade practices’ – the country has been the main target of President Trump’s America-first campaign. And concern is growing about political meddling by China in both Australia and New Zealand/ Aotearoa. The Australian Security Intelligence Organization has accused two well-known Chinese entrepreneurs of using donations to buy political support for Beijing in Canberra.

Closer to home, both Thailand and Myanmar have pulled the plug on BRI projects deemed favourable to China. And in August 2016, Kenyans swarmed a construction site of the $13.8 billion Mombasa to Nairobi railway, attacking Chinese workers with clubs and knives. The Kenyan workers on the project were unhappy with their $2.50 a day wages.6

But China is learning from its mistakes. Every week sees another joint BRI investment announcement: the facts on the ground are accumulating. There are now more than 40 rail lines carrying goods from China to Europe in just 18 days. Last year saw the first direct London-China rail shipments.

And in Southeast Asia the first stretch of a $7.2 billion high-speed railway from Bangkok to China was launched. It may soon be possible to travel from Singapore to Kunming in southwest China in less than 12 hours.

The new Silk Road is well on its way.

Turns Out, He Was Promoting His Company’s Interests, Too. - ProPublica",https://www.propublica.org/article/west-virginia-company-interests,"This article was produced in partnership with the Charleston Gazette-Mail, which is a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.

Last November, President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping looked on in Beijing as officials from the state of West Virginia and a Chinese energy company signed what was hailed as a landmark deal for the state.

Under the deal, China Energy Investment Corporation would invest more than $80 billion over the next 20 years in West Virginia’s natural gas industry.

West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice and other state leaders have been banking on the China deal, predicting it would create tens of thousands of additional jobs in the state. It was also described as a victory for Trump, the largest in a series of Chinese investments in the U.S. that totaled $250 billion.

But on Friday, Justice revealed that an ethical cloud has appeared over the China deal: At least one member of the state’s trade delegation — a gas industry executive — was also working to help his private company on the trip.

Brian Abraham, the governor’s general counsel, said the state was “using someone who probably shouldn’t have been involved in the negotiations” as part of its trade delegation.

“People that were there in China maybe representing their own special interests, we didn’t think was right,” the governor added.

The Daily Digest Get the latest news from ProPublica every afternoon.

West Virginia officials are eager to see the fruits of the China Energy investment, as a cornerstone to the natural gas industry’s continued growth in the state. But along the way, some lawmakers and watchdogs are questioning whether the state is putting the industry’s interests ahead of public concerns in attempting to broaden the state’s economic base. This year, ProPublica is partnering with The Charleston Gazette-Mail to examine those issues.

During a press conference Friday, neither Justice nor Abraham would name the individual or his company. In an interview, Abraham later confirmed that the individual was Steven B. Hedrick, who is CEO of Appalachia Development Group LLC. and also CEO of the Mid-Atlantic Technology, Research and Innovation Center, or MATRIC, a non-profit that partners with various industries on research and development efforts.

Appalachia Development Group has been seeking a loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy as part of an effort to build a natural gas “storage hub” for various natural gas liquid byproducts that can be used in manufacturing.

Abraham said the state Commerce Department paid for Hedrick’s travel for the China negotiations because it considered him, effectively, an acting state official, part of a special Commerce Department program in which certain executives are “loaned” to the state.

The governor’s office, though, discovered later that Hedrick had not joined the program and when asked to do so after the trip, he declined, Abraham said. Had he joined the program, Hedrick would have been required to sign an agreement to abide by the state ethics law’s prohibition on using public office for private gain.

“Why is this person behind the curtain at Commerce if they’re an individual on the outside?” Abraham said. “That created an ethical dilemma.”

Also, Abraham cited one incident in which state officials were later told Hedrick asked China Energy officials to specifically target some of their investment toward his company’s natural gas storage hub. Abraham said that, during one trip, Hedrick stayed behind an extra day and pitched his project to China Energy after others from the state had left.

Abraham said that Hedrick was asked to repay the state $23,000 in travel expenses, and that the repayment had been made.

Read More One West Virginia County Tried to Break Its Dependence on the Energy Industry. It Was Overruled. After seeing the scars of coal, Fayette County banned the disposal of natural gas drilling waste. Industry fought back, arguing the community doesn’t get a say.

A spokeswoman for Hedrick said he was not available for comment, but she issued a short statement via email that said Hedrick was “grateful to respond to the request of the state of West Virginia to support the Commerce Department’s mission to attract business to the state.”

The statement said that MATRIC “promptly paid any expenses invoiced by the state.”

Though officials signed a memorandum of understanding in China, the state has refused to release the text of the agreement and few details have been made public. Both the China deal and the natural gas storage hub are considered by many state officials as key and related economic development projects for West Virginia’s future.

The state’s natural gas industry has already greatly expanded, and backers of the China deal say it will provide huge amounts of capital that could fund processing plants, pipelines and other facilities that will turn natural gas byproducts into crucial ingredients for a wide variety of plastics manufacturers. These kinds of “downstream” developments will allow West Virginia to capture far more jobs and economic growth than just drilling for gas and shipping it out of state.

The revelations about the China deal came just one day after Justice asked for and received the resignation of state Commerce Secretary Woody Thrasher, whose agency bungled the state’s implementation of a federally funded flood-relief program.

Thrasher was the top state official who traveled to China last November as part of the trade delegation.

Justice said Friday that discussions toward realizing the Chinese natural gas investments are ongoing, and repeated his earlier statements that the deal “came into being” because of his personal friendship with Trump.

It was not only heavy rains of 6 to 8 inches and flooding that struck parts of Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Some areas saw damaging winds, large hail, downed trees, demolished roads and buildings.

Flash flooding in Michigan wiped out roads in the Houghton area on Sunday.

The downpours led to more than 60 sinkholes and washouts, according to CNN affiliate WLUC-TV . The flooding also left water and sewer lines exposed.

One man was found dead in Ashland County, Wisconsin, after his vehicle was seen in a flooded roadway, according to the county's sheriff's office. On Sunday morning, deputies found a pickup truck in a ditch in a flooded road with the driver's door open. The water had reached up to six to eight feet on the driver's side. The driver's body was found about 60 feet from the car. He was identified as Thomas Koeper, 75, of Mason, Wisconsin, and the incident is under investigation, according to the Ashland County Sheriff's Office.

The weather was blamed for injuries suffered by a 12-year-old boy early Sunday when his home caved in during flash flooding in Houghton County, Michigan. County Administrator Eric Forsberg said the boy is alive, but had no information on his condition.

The insurance secured by the district government was purchased using governmental funds, with China Pacific Insurance – who will team up with Ping An Insurance and PICC as joint insurers – becoming the chief insurer through a public bid.

Housing or family property losses, as well as death during typhoon, rainstorm, flood or other disasters within the district can be compensated through the insurance, reported Shanghai Daily.

Gan Yuli, Deputy General Manager of China Pacific Insurance Co’s Shanghai branch, said, “Each household can be compensated by at most ¥12,000 (US$1,870) if their apartment is flooded or damaged during disasters. Other property losses can lead to compensation up to ¥6,000 ($934).”

Additionally, a maximum of ¥800,000 ($1,246,680) will be compensated under the scheme for any death caused by typhoon, rainstorm, flood or other emergencies, according to the company.

The rescuers taking part in flood prevention or disaster relief can receive compensation for serious injury or medical treatment.

At HK$132,060 per square feet, it set a world record for the price of a condominium or apartment transaction.

For many experts, the news wasn’t surprising.

""It is possible for Hong Kong to surpass Monaco to become the place with the most expensive property prices in the world,"" says Maggie Hu, assistant professor of real estate and nance at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

At the end of the day, it comes down to a limited supply of developable land. ""Only 6.9%, or 77 square kilometers, of Hong Kong’s landmass is zoned for housing, and about half of that is allocated to low-density rural settlements that cannot be easily transacted in the property market,"" she says. ""This is a meager amount compared with the land allocated to country parks and natural reserves, which take up about 65.8% of Hong Kong’s land.""

Changing that won’t be easy, according to K. W. Chau, head of the real estate and construction department at the University of Hong Kong.

""There is a huge political resistance from different stakeholders to change this land-use pattern...and because people know this is a di cult problem to solve, they rush into the market knowing prices will continue to grow.""

""Housing prices in Hong Kong have more than doubled since the depths of the global financial crisis and now stand at record-high levels,"" says Denis Ma, head of research for Jones Lang LaSalle, or JLL, in Hong Kong.

Meanwhile, the government’s Rating and Valuation Department reported that overall property prices increased 12.5% year over year in 2017, pushed up by a mere 3.8% housing-vacancy rate—down from 4.3% in 2012.

According to Knight Frank’s 2017 Global Cities report, Hong Kong was one of the most improved markets of the year in terms of price growth, with annual growth of 14.8%, compared with 7.4% in 2016.

Government ""Cooling"" Schemes

In response, government officials have put housing affordability at the forefront of policy, levying higher stamp duties of 15% (30% for foreigners), introducing more restrictive financing terms, and pushing to convert more industrial land and farmland into residential space. But with prices rising every month for nearly two years, many are asking if prices will ever stop rising.

The experts agree: Not anytime soon.

In fact, Mr. Ma notes that the ""cooling"" measures not only have failed to rein in property prices but also have made the situation worse by shutting down the secondary market, where transaction volumes have been cut in half since demand-suppression policies were introduced in 2009. (Housing prices, in contrast, have increased approximately 85%.)

Overall, cooling measures haven’t slowed growth, says Daniel Shih, director of research at Colliers International Hong Kong, noting that year-over-year transaction volumes increased by 13% last year.

""We project prices will increase up to 10% in 2018, with the luxury segment growing by 3% to 5%,"" Mr. Shih says. ""And we aren’t going to see price adjustments until 2020 because the supply shortage remains unsolved, and we don’t expect real interest rates to turn positive before the second half of 2019.""

From Penta:High-Net-Worth Americans Pursue Wealth for ‘Emotional Wellbeing’

Little is deterring cashed-up mainland buyers and local residents who are enjoying robust business conditions in Hong Kong: an unemployment rate at a 20-year low (2.9% in January), a 10.4% increase in sales of luxury goods, an 18.1% increase in exports, and a stable inflation rate.

A buoyant stock market—up 36% in 2017—is another factor, adds David Ji, Knight Frank director and head of research and consultancy in Greater China. ""This creates a wealth effect where people want to put money into real estate to lock in profits,"" he says.

Prices Expected to Keep Growing

And there’s even less chance of slowing prices in the luxury market, which Mr. Ji projects will grow 8% by the end of 2018.

""For the wealthy, Hong Kong has many attractive points that drive continual demand,"" Mr. Ji says. ""It’s a major financial center for business and investment, and there’s an active buyer’s market with a good lifestyle and proximity to other wealthy people.""

Indeed, according to Binoche Chan, chief operating officer of List Sotheby’s International Realty, demand is ""very strong"" in the top-end luxury market. ""Hong Kong is a ‘must’ destination for wealthy locals and mainland Chinese if they want to invest in property,"" she says.

She adds that many permanent residents are also buying to take advantage of a one-time 4.25% stamp duty on the purchase of their first luxury property of HK$20 million or more— which applies even if they have other properties purchased through a company.

According to JLL, the biggest price hikes in the luxury segment are in neighborhoods like The Peak, Happy Valley/Tai Hang, and Sai Kung, where the past three years have seen an increase of 27.8%, 32.6%, and 29.3%, respectively.

The only thing that might cause prices to fall would be a change in sentiment, Mr. Shih says, recalling a sudden 10% dip in 2015 when people feared an interest-rate increase.

Mr. Ma, meanwhile, forecasts 10% growth over the next two years in the capital values of luxury properties, with those at the top end outperforming expectations.

54,54,FL-2018-000068-CHN,Survivor of 2016 Fort Hood training accident recalls flood - ArmyTimes.com,https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2018/06/06/survivor-of-2016-fort-hood-training-accident-recalls-flood/,"KILLEEN, Texas — On June 2, 2016, Kameron Robinson was riding in the truck that rolled over in flooded Owl Creek on Fort Hood, claiming the lives of eight soldiers and a West Point cadet.

The Killeen Daily Herald reports Robinson was one of 12 on the truck during the drill and is one of three survivors.

Robinson, who’s no longer with the Army, recently decided to share the memories that haunt him two years later.

NCO blamed for accident that killed nine soldiers at Fort Hood Flash flood warnings had been issued and the crossing had been designated off-limits, but a platoon heading out for some Sergeant’s Time training on the morning of June 2, 2016 didn’t know that.

The drill was to be low-water familiarization training for newly assigned transport operators, and the weather had taken a turn for the worse with a heavy downpour of rain and severe flooding, Robinson said.

Robinson and other soldiers had reservations about conducting the training that morning.

“Amongst ourselves walking up to our vehicles, we were wondering if there was any word on the training because the rain was getting pretty bad,” Robinson said.

Robinson said just prior to departure on the training, he and other soldiers were approached by the platoon leader and by Staff Sgt. Miguel Colonvazquez, who were discussing that morning’s training.

Robinson and the other soldiers asked: Did you not see the flash flood warnings we’ve been getting? Are you sure we should be going out there?

Robinson said the platoon leader’s response was, because the platoon hadn’t done training in some time, the training needed to go forward.

After the platoon leader left the area, the soldiers told Colonvazquez they didn’t feel comfortable with the morning’s training because of the weather. Robinson said Colonvazquez left to speak with the platoon leader about altering the training plan but returned a short time later stating the training had to go forward as planned.

Robinson said Colonvazquez, in the past, had fought against doing things he was uncomfortable doing but would follow the orders given to him.

Robinson said he and Colonvazquez, Spc. Christine Faith Armstrong, Spc. Rogelio Morales, Spc. Tyrail Friend, Pfc. Brandon Austin Banner, Pfc. Zachery Nathaniel Fuller, Pvt. Isaac Lee Deleon, Pvt. Eddy Raelaurin Gates, Pvt. Tysheena Lynette James, Spc. Yingming Sun and Cadet Mitchell Alexander Winey got in their Light Medium Tactical Vehicle or LMTV.

Colonvasquez, Winey and James were in the cab of the vehicle. The rear of the LMTV, about 5 feet off the ground, was equipped with two bench seats along the sides. On the left, behind the driver, beginning toward the cab, were Robinson, Friend, Gates, Sun and Fuller. On the right side were Banner, Morales, Armstrong and DeLeon.

On the way to the training area, the soldiers talked among themselves or caught a quick nap. When the vehicle stopped, Robinson told the other soldiers to get ready because he believed they were at the training location.

“We’re sitting there, and the vehicle is slowly moving, and all the sudden water started hitting our feet, and I’m thinking, ‘OK, a little bit of water, we’re just going to go over it and that will be it,’” Robinson said. “The water started rising and rising, and it got to my knee caps and everybody started panicking a little bit.”

Robinson tried to calm the soldiers, telling them, it’s just a little bit of water, and it will eventually recede, and they’d be fine. Then, the water was at their waist. Robinson said to lift the flap on the back of the tarp-covered vehicle, so he could see their surroundings. He looked behind them.

“All I saw were the other convoy trucks, the ground and a mountain of water between them and us.”

The water reached Robinson’s chest, but he continued to try reassuring the other soldiers to not panic, because panicking under water can lead to drowning.

Then, the truck was completely submerged.

“I’m hanging onto the bars on the top of the (LMTV canopy support), and I just feel the whole truck rolling, thinking to myself that I’m about to just drown, in a military vehicle, in a training accident,” Robinson said. “I’m just sitting there thinking, it felt like forever, and the vehicle just pops back up. There were nine of us back there, but when it pops back up there’s three.”

Robinson said DeLeon was in front of him and asked what had happened. He told DeLeon to take off his gear and get out of the truck and the water. He next saw Gates hanging from the tailgate looking back.

“I told her, ‘don’t worry about it, I’m going to come get you, and we’re going to go out,’” Robinson said. “As soon as I took a step, the truck flipped over again, and it threw me out. I swam across and grabbed a branch, the truck hit me, and I went back under.”

Robinson eventually resurfaced and grabbed another branch and sat up on a knee, then heard a blood-curdling scream.

“Morales, he screamed, but it wasn’t a normal scream,” Robinson said. “It was a scream you don’t really hear often, so it put me in a state of shock, and I couldn’t move.”

Robinson said Morales asked him what had happened.

“I looked over, and I saw Friend (on the bank) throwing up water screaming, ‘Help me, help me! I’m drowning,‘” Robinson said. “I couldn’t move, I’d never seen anything like that, so I was just staring at him.”

Robinson heard branches moving and breaking as other soldiers from vehicles behind them in the convoy arrived to help. He collected himself and remembered Gates was on the back tailgate so he headed downstream to look for her and other potential survivors.

“I took off all my stuff, and I took off downriver screaming for anybody there, looking along the bank, looking for anybody,” Robinson said. “I went down a good mile screaming names, but nobody was answering.

He had been joined by a soldier from the convoy.

“We didn’t see nobody. all we saw was the (truck’s) drip pan floating down the river.”

Robinson thought perhaps the others had escaped on the other side of the bank when he heard a soldier calling out names.

“I heard him screaming ‘Staff Sgt. Colon, Fuller, Armstrong,’ everybody’s name, but there was no response,” Robinson said.

Robinson returned to the spot of the initial accident and was met by emergency responders. He was taken to the hospital in nearby Gatesville and eventually to Darnell Army Medical Center.

“I told them (hospital staff) if they find anybody to let us know and keep us updated, and that’s when they started letting us know they found bodies,” Robinson said.

Robinson said agents from the Army’s Criminal Investigation Division arrived at the hospital to get statements.

“They just asked us what happened, who made the call (to do the training),” Robinson said. “They were looking for somebody to blame.” Robinson told them what had happened but did not mention who had made the call.

Robinson spent about four days in the hospital. The platoon leader who had insisted they conduct the training visited him.

“He came in crying, but I was like, ‘don’t give me none of that,’ because we could have avoided all of this had he just simply listened to us,” Robinson said.

After being discharged from the hospital, Robinson was given two weeks of leave to recover before returning to work. A gag order was issued by the command and none of the soldiers could speak about the accident. To date, no other investigating officials from either Army’s C.I.D. or the Fort Hood unit have interviewed Robinson. The investigating officer appointed by Fort Hood had concluded much of the blame rested with Colonvazquez.

“The only people that talked to me were (on) the day of (the accident) at the hospital,” Robinson said. “At least get a statement from us, from our point of view.”

In the months that followed the accident, Robinson got the feeling the chain of command didn’t care about them. He said the platoon leader was moved to another unit immediately after the accident and has since been promoted.

“After the unit started treating us a certain way, I didn’t want to be around them anymore,” Robinson said.

“I couldn’t really focus and being trapped here in the same unit, was just messing with my mind,” Robinson said.

Robinson said he sought assistance from several agencies on the installation where he could speak to others about the trauma he went through.

He began experiencing financial problems after what he said was a series of mishaps with his military orders which resulted in his pay being temporarily stopped.

“I didn’t get paid for three months, I had my car repossessed, so I was just in a bad spot and depressed,” Robinson said.

Robinson, who was already enrolled in the Army’s Substance Abuse Program, informed his counselors of his use of marijuana to help deal with the depression and anxiety he was experiencing.

In June 2017, he was arrested for soliciting prostitution. It was his first arrest for anything, he said. He paid court fees, was assigned to take a class at a school for offenders and will be on probation for two months.

He later failed a drug test and was separated from the Army on Jan. 24 with a general discharge under honorable conditions for a rehabilitative failure.

It’s been four years since the Santa Maria, California, native shipped out for the Army on March 17, 2014, to be trained as a motor transport operator.

He arrived at Fort Hood in July 2014 assigned to Company F, 3rd Battalion, 16th Field Artillery Regiment, 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team. After completing a rotation to the Republic of Korea, he returned to Fort Hood, just prior to the deadly training accident.

Robinson is currently enrolled at Colorado Technical University online studying to earn a bachelor’s degree health care management in an attempt to pick up the pieces of his life and hope for a more promising future.

He still suffers from the traumatic events of June 2, 2016.

“I’m still kind of messed up about it, this is something I’m not going to forget,” Robinson said. “I had gotten too close to those people for them to be gone like that.”","Wed, 06 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/uvZEnQEF8eRZB4QDO0Fmv_7K0h4=/1200x630/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-mco.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A7GFEU2AG5CHNOEVVELEC6PR3Y.jpg,"['platoon', 'training', 'robinson', 'vehicle', 'truck', 'told', 'soldiers', 'survivor', 'hood', 'fort', 'flood', 'accident', 'water', 'army', '2016', 'recalls']",

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Wednesday that high-tide flooding, sometimes called sunny-day or ""nuisance flooding,"" tied or set records last year in more than a quarter of the 98 places the agency monitors around the country.

The report found Sabine Pass, Texas, had 23 days of high-tide flooding last year. The area is part of Port Arthur, where most houses now stand on stilts after the community was hit repeatedly by destructive hurricanes. Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Boston had 22 each. Cities in other parts of the country experienced fewer tidal floods, but many of those cities still saw records set.

""Though year-to-year and regional variability exist, the underlying trend is quite clear: Due to sea level rise, the national average frequency of high tide flooding is double what it was 30 years ago,"" the report said.

Ben Horton, a Rutgers University researcher who was not involved in the study, called it ""a warning, a shot across the bow.""

""Across the whole of the U.S. coastline, we are in dire need of action,"" he said.

In addition to the conclusions of the report, Horton said it is just as significant that ""this is a federally funded sea-level assessment funded by the Trump Administration, and it shows that the problems on our coasts are getting worse and will get worse."" The Republican president has derided climate change as a hoax.

NOAA said the top five cities that saw the highest number of flood days across the U.S. and broke records during the 2017 meteorological year, which is May 2017-April 2018, include Boston; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Sandy Hook, New Jersey; Sabine Pass, Texas; and Galveston, Texas.

""These cities faced the brunt of an active nor'easter and hurricane seasons and sea level rise, which has made these and other less extreme events more impactful,"" NOAA said.

Record high-tide flooding around the country included 20 days at Sandy Hook, New Jersey; 18 at Galveston Pier in Texas; 17 at Wachapreague, Virginia; 15 at the battery neighborhood of New York City; 14 at Bay St. Louis-Waveland in Mississippi; and 13 in Providence, Rhode Island and San Diego.

As sea levels rise, coastal communities around the U.S. are experiencing flooding that closes roads or inconveniences daily activities on an increasing basis. Two of the three main entrances to Atlantic City, the east coast gambling resort, are often flooded by tides, with one or both lanes having to be shut down for hours at a time.

""What used to be uncommon is now becoming fairly common,"" said William Sweet, a NOAA oceanographer and co-author of the report.

He said global sea levels are rising at a rate of about 3 millimeters a year, or about an inch every eight years. Horton and other Rutgers researchers project that by 2050, seas off New Jersey will rise by an additional 1.4 feet.

The report found tidal flooding was at record levels last year along parts of the southeast Atlantic and eastern Gulf coasts.

Anticipated weather conditions this year and next may result in even higher than expected flood frequencies along the east and west coasts.","Thu, 07 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/06/07/d1b1a456-0770-41b2-b955-9adf314bac2d/thumbnail/1200x630/23180785dc4788a375949dadd1ab244c/galveston1.jpg,"['rise', 'ago', 'hightide', 'noaa', 'sea', 'records', 'atlantic', 'twice', 'jersey', '30', 'city', 'report', 'flooding', 'levels']",

Most of the damage occurred from the Rockies to the Mid-Atlantic, and thunderstorms led to catastrophic flash flooding in Ellicott City, Md. for the second time in less than two years, said the report, noting that total combined economic losses from just two of the events were minimally estimated at US$2.3 billion, with public and private insurers expected to cover more than two-thirds of the total. The final figure is expected to be even higher.

The severe weather occurred amid of one of the quietest starts to tornado season in the U.S. – fewer than 450 tornadoes were reported as of June 1, putting 2018 in the lowest 25 percent of years since 1950, Impact Forecasting said.

Additional North American thunderstorm damage occurred in areas of Canada’s Ontario and Quebec, with one event costing insurers nearly US$325 million, said the report, quoting catastrophe analyst CatIQ. Most of the hail and wind damage occurred in Ontario, making it the costliest thunderstorm in the province since 2013.

Meanwhile, flooding along the Yangtze River Basin and elsewhere in China led to over 75,000 homes sustaining varying levels of damage, and total combined economic losses in excess of US$400 million.

The combined death toll from extensive flooding in Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, and Rwanda since February rose to nearly 400 by the end of May, having affected more than one million people and decimated infrastructure.

“The month of May featured significant weather events in nearly every major region around the globe,” said Steve Bowen, Impact Forecasting director and meteorologist. “While the multi-billion dollar economic cost of severe convective storms in the United States and Canada was not out of the ordinary given the peak of severe weather season, perhaps most noteworthy was the rarity of two tropical cyclones directly affecting the Arabian Peninsula and Somalia in a matter of days.”

Bowen said the impacts of storms in northeast Africa only added to recent humanitarian challenges in a region already suffering from abnormally severe seasonal flooding.

“The flood peril will be a very important point of focus as insurance continues to grow across the emerging markets in Africa,” he added.

Impact Forecasting provided details of other natural disasters occurring elsewhere in the world during May:

Convective storm damage was noted in Asia and Europe. In India alone, nearly 300 people died in thunderstorm-related incidents. An active storm pattern in Central and Western Europe at the end of May will likely result in insurance payouts reaching the hundreds of millions of dollars.

In Australia, an insurance catastrophe was declared by the Insurance Council of Australia following floods in New South Wales. Preliminary insurance payouts neared US$21 million.

Two very rare tropical cyclones made landfall in Somalia and Oman in a matter of days of each other. Tropical Cyclone Sagar became the strongest storm to strike Somalia on record, reaching speeds of 60 mph (95 kph), and also left heavy damage during its path through the Gulf of Aden. Tropical Cyclone Mekunu made landfall in Oman as a 115 mph (185 kph) Category 3 storm. Widespread wind and flood damage was reported.

Subtropical Storm Alberto developed in the Gulf of Mexico and made landfall as a 45 mph (75 kph) system near Panama City, Fla. Heavy rains and isolated tornadoes impacted an area from Florida to Michigan along its path. At least seven people died in Cuba due to extensive flooding.

Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano erupted beginning May 3 and continued to spewing ash into the atmosphere and sending lava flows into residential areas. Hundreds of homes and other structures were destroyed.

NORTHEAST PHILADELPHIA -- Friends of a young woman who died after being swept away in flash floods at the Pennypack Creek are sharing their memories of the 30-year-old avid photographer.Authorities say Rebecca Bunting was knocked into the creek shortly before 6 p.m. Saturday in the area of Ryan and Sandyford avenues in Northeast Philadelphia. Her body was discovered near the Frankford Avenue Bridge in Holmesburg around 10:45 a.m. Sunday.Police say she most likely passed away Saturday night when she was initially knocked into the water. According to police, Bunting's body was found trapped under furniture left in the creek.On Sunday morning off-camera, Action News spoke to the neighbor who called 911. He said he was at home when he heard a man screaming for help. When the neighbor ran out, he found the missing woman's boyfriend standing on Ryan Avenue looking into the water and screaming her name.Her boyfriend explained to witnesses that they were inside a storm drain by Roosevelt Boulevard when a rush of water came through. He says his girlfriend was swept away, while he was able to pull himself out. When dive teams were called, they had no luck finding Bunting. The water was murky and, in some spots, police say it was 10-feet high.Friends say Bunting was known for being a photographer. Police believe Bunting was in the storm drain taking photos when the incident occurred.""She was always trying to get really cool photos. She's really talented. She could bring out beauty in any landscape,"" friend Cristen DeDomenico said.Friends said Bunting had just returned from a trip to Europe. They said she was a bartender at Miller's Ale House in South Philadelphia, where she was loved by staff and customers.

China has imposed punitive measures against Brazilian chicken imports after preliminary results of a government investigation found Brazil had been dumping chickens on the Chinese market – hurting the domestic industry.

Brazilian authorities and poultry producers are pushing for the decision to be reversed once the probe is complete. Our correspondent Paulo Cabral has the story.

There’s concern but cautious optimism among Brazilian poultry farmers and exporters regarding Chinese anti-dumping measures.

The Chinese Ministry of Commerce imposed a temporary surcharge of up to 38.4% on Brazilian broiler chickens, arguing its investigation into Brazilian imports showed a flood of imported products sold at below-market prices damaged the Chinese industry.

The Brazilian government reacted with a statement saying that Chinese domestic production has continued to grow in recent years regardless of Brazilian exports and that shipments from Brazil represent only 5% of China’s total demand. The association representing Brazilian animal protein products says it trusts China will lift the provisional anti-dumping measures after Brazilians send further information to the Ministry of Commerce – the Mofcom.

“We don’t make dumping. We respect the Chinese people so much, the People’s Republic of China is a good customer of Brazil, is a good partner of Brazil, and so we hope sincerely with humility that Mofcom will change their mind and not impose restrictions in Brazil because we don’t make it and we intend to keep helping China in the food security of their people,” said Ricardo Santin, the executive director of the Brazilian Animal Protein Association (ABPA).

Brazilian poultry producers have had a rough couple of years facing continued economic and political crises in Brazil, a food safety scandal in 2017 prompting several import embargoes and a recent trucker’s strike which forced farmers to cull about 70 million chickens because feed couldn’t be delivered to the farms.

According to MBAgro’s Cesar Alves, an expert in agricultural products, the anti-dumping measures add to a negative scenario. But he hopes for some recovery in coming months.

“This is bad news for the trade of chicken. We have some problems with Saudi Arabia, too, and Europe. But the second part of the year we should have better prices for chicken and we believe the trade will increase because we are more competitive now with the exchange rate devaluation,” said Alves.

China’s anti-dumping measures against Brazil have been put place just as the United States struggles to regain access to the Chinese chicken market. In February China lifted anti-dumping penalties against the US and is under pressure from Washington to accept more imported chicken in its ongoing trade conflict.

71,71,FL-2018-000068-CHN,Playground to Dump Anti-Chinese Politician’s Name - Courthouse News Service,https://www.courthousenews.com/playground-to-dump-anti-chinese-politicians-name/,"SAN FRANCISCO (CN) – In its latest effort to reckon with its past, the city of San Francisco will change the name of a public playground that honors a former congressman who pushed to extend the Chinese Exclusion Act.

Serving as San Francisco’s congressman from 1899 to 1903 and 1905 to 1924, German-born Julius Kahn wrote legislation to make the Chinese Exclusion Act, originally set to expire in 1902, a permanent law of the land until its repeal in 1943. It was the first U.S. law to bar a specific ethnic group from entering the country.

Earlier this week, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to remove Kahn’s name from the playground on the edge of the majestic Presidio park with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge.

“Former Congressman Julius Kahn’s anti-Asian immigration policies during the early 1900s did not espouse the values that San Francisco stands for today,” San Francisco Supervisor Norman Yee said before the vote Tuesday.

It is just the latest in a series of steps San Francisco has taken recently to address some of the uglier chapters in its history. The city also moved to rebrand Columbus Day as Indigenous People’s Day, get rid of a monument that some say glorifies the conquest of Native Americans, and rename Justin Herman Plaza, which honored a former city planner who oversaw the demolition of a black neighborhood in the 1960s for a major redevelopment project.

San Francisco historian John Martini says re-examining historical figures, like the slave-owning founding fathers, sometimes requires a more nuanced analysis that weighs the good and bad contributions of those individuals. But when it comes to Kahn, Martini thinks it’s not such a close call.

“He was a good example of being a stone racist,” Martini said. “Even by the most generous standard, there’s no reason to honor people like that.”

Kahn’s grandson, Julius “Sandy” Kahn III, disagrees. In a San Francisco Chronicle op-ed published in May, the junior Kahn argued that anti-Chinese legislation was “widely supported by the people of San Francisco and California” at that time. He noted his grandfather’s role in bringing the World’s Fair to San Francisco in 1915 and urged the board not to “dismiss his great works and good deeds for actions he endeavored to make amends.”

A history of Chinese exclusion

Three miles east of the playground, a permanent exhibit at the Chinese Historical Society in San Francisco’s Chinatown examines the impact of the Chinese Exclusion Act, passed in 1882, on Chinese American families and the nation’s civil rights laws.

“For those families who date their American experience prior to 1965, there wasn’t a single family in the Chinese community that was not touched by the Chinese Exclusion Act, both what came before and the subsequent reenactment and broadening of that act,” said Douglas Chan, vice president of the Chinese Historical Society’s board of directors.

U.S. laws barring Chinese workers from entering the country came after federal courts struck down a series of state and local laws that sought to make it harder for Chinese-Americans to work and earn money in California.

In 1850, California imposed a $20 monthly tax on foreign miners, almost exclusively a tax on the Chinese. The state also passed laws requiring shipmasters to post bond for alien passengers, prohibiting Chinese immigrants from setting foot on land, and imposing a tax on every Chinese adult who was not already taxed or engaged exclusively in producing rice, sugar, tea or coffee.

In 1863, the state invalidated all testimony of Chinese witnesses against white people. This allowed white people to attack or kill Chinese people with impunity unless another white person was willing to testify about the crime.

After the Civil War, many of these laws became unconstitutional. The 14th Amendment established the right to equal protection under the law. The Burlingame Treaty of 1868 recognized the right of free migration between China and the U.S., and the Civil Rights Act of 1870 held that all people in the U.S. have the same right to give evidence and full and equal benefit of laws.

Responding to these post-Civil War developments, Californians devised new and insidious ways to discriminate against the Chinese. In 1874, the state imposed a tax on any noncitizen arriving in a foreign port who was “lunatic, deaf, dumb, blind, crippled, infirm” or “has been a pauper in any other country” or “a convicted criminal, or a lewd or debauched woman.” The law was ultimately struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court, finding it gave the state too much power to restrict immigration – an exclusively federal power – beyond what was necessary for state self-protection.

In 1880, California made it a crime for any state official or corporation established under the laws of California to hire a Chinese worker. U.S. District Judge Ogden Hoffman struck the law down as blatant violation of Burlingame Treaty, after a quicksilver mine owner who depended on cheap Chinese labor challenged it in court.

Legal victories over state and local anti-Chinese laws fueled a stronger push to enact federal legislation to address the “Chinese problem.” This ultimately led to the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act barring all Chinese workers from entering the country, with exceptions for merchants, students, teachers and diplomats.

The law led to a flood of federal habeas corpus petitions filed by Chinese-Americans who were denied re-entry to the U.S. after trips abroad. Congress responded by passing the Scott Act in 1888, which barred all Chinese from entering the country and voided certificates that had previously allowed them re-entry.

The destruction of public birth documents in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire created an opportunity for Chinese men already here to claim citizenship. Those men could travel back to China and claim their wives had given birth to a son, creating “slots” other Chinese people could purchase to come to the U.S. Those who purchased the “slots” had to undergo sometimes weeks-long interrogations with immigration officials before they could enter. The Chinese men and women who used this avenue were called “paper sons” or “paper daughters.”

At the Chinese Historical Society’s museum, a life-sized photo recreates the tense pressure faced by a young Chinese boy sitting across the table from an adult immigration official, trying to match his story with the one on paper to gain entry into the United States.

The museum also features recreations of the tight quarters in which Chinese men, women, and children were detained at the immigration station on Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay.

Anti-Chinese policies and civil rights laws

Chan, a lawyer who served as legislative aide to former U.S. Senator Alan Cranston in the 1970s, says the fight against anti-Chinese laws in the late 1800s and early 1900s laid much of the legal foundation for civil rights jurisprudence.

“The history of exclusion poses a challenge to legal institutions and their ability to adapt to changing times and the ability of the law to respond to human values,” Chan said.

The Supreme Court’s 1886 decision in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, about San Francisco’s’ refusal to issue permits for Chinese laundry businesses, was the first to hold that a law which appears race-neutral on its face can violate equal protection when it is applied in a discriminatory manner.

In 1898, the Supreme Court also established the concept of birthright citizenship in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, finding a Chinese cook who was born in San Francisco could not be denied re-entry because his birth on U.S. soil automatically made him a citizen.

Chan says remembering the impact of the Chinese Exclusion Act is crucial because failing to acknowledge our nation’s past sins means we might be doomed to repeat them. It’s a lesson Chan views as especially prescient today with the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to ramp up deportations and cut the number of immigrants and refugees entering the country.

“To understand and confront the Chinese Exclusion Act is to be forced to take sides in a debate that continues to this day,” Chan said. “The lesson of the Exclusion Act is that America was built on the strength of its immigrants. It is both the source of light in our country but also representative of the dark side.”

Removing Kahn’s name from the playground

This history of oppression against Chinese people and its unique connection to San Francisco makes the issue of Kahn’s role in extending the Chinese Exclusion Act a particularly potent and emotional one for the Chinese-American community.

It was Kahn’s efforts as congressman that helped extend the Chinese Exclusion Act, which remained in full force until its repeal in 1943. Even after its repeal, a quota system limited the number of Chinese immigrants to 105 per year. That ended in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act.

Chan rejects concerns that renaming the playground is a purely symbolic gesture or that removing controversial names and figures from public squares might serve only to sweep the uglier parts of San Francisco’s history under the rug.

“Public spaces should be reserved to honor Americans who stood for the best of this country,” Chan said. “Monuments should be there to remind us of the commonality that we have, rather than used to divide or oppress or persecute our neighbors.”","Thu, 07 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SF-Kahn-playground1-225x300.jpg,"['state', 'chinese', 'laws', 'exclusion', 'san', 'playground', 'antichinese', 'act', 'law', 'dump', 'country', 'francisco', 'immigration', 'politicians']", 
72,72,FL-2018-000068-CHN,Climate insurance and water-related disaster risk management – Unlikely partners in promoting development? - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/climate-insurance-and-water-related-disaster-risk-management-unlikely-partners,"There is a growing consensus that insurance, risk transfer, and sharing mechanisms have an important and growing role to play, particularly in offsetting the economic impacts associated with extreme events. What is less clear is the extent to which such instruments encourage adaptation programmes and policies that would serve to minimise future loss and damage and, hence, contribute to sustainable development. This paper does not pretend to offer answers, but rather contributes to the emerging discussion and brings to that discussion a water lens.

1 Purpose of this paper

The number of natural disasters of all types appears to have increased in the last few decades though there is some debate over the evidence for this. What is clear though is that the economic costs associated with extreme weather events have increased. For lesserdeveloped countries the developmental outcomes have been particularly severe. Recent research indicates that between 1990 and 2015, most economic losses resulted from flooding: around 40% of the total (Daniell, Wenzel, and Schaefer, 2016). Better flood management by governments, for example by China and Japan, seems to have resulted in reduced flood-related losses. Better disaster response and better building and infrastructure have reduced the relative costs in many developed countries. However, for developing countries the necessary regulations and investments are not in place, resulting in them being disproportionately affected when disasters do strike (UNISDR, 2010; Surminski and Oramas-Dorta, 2014).

As the global climate shifts and changes the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, they are expected to increase. It is, therefore, not surprising that there has been increasing interest among the global community in financing adaptation measures and the means to mobilise investments. In this context, there is a developing discourse emerging from recent Conferences of the Parties around loss and damage, risk-insurance facilities, climate-risk pooling, and other insurance solutions. The insurance industry is increasingly aware of the emerging challenges associated with disasters and climate change. An emphasis on loss and damage by itself runs the risk of limiting this risk to being reactive and compensatory as opposed to promoting measures that contribute to risk-reduction strategies and affirmative action. The scope for the development of products that provide an incentive for proactive policies and interventions poses a particular challenge in developing countries. This is in part due to weak and indebted economies, income disparities, and the often less than equitable provision of basic services.

Many products and initiatives have been developed, but it is not always clear what their effects have been and to what extent they prompt actions to reduce climate risks and build resilience (Gerber and Mirzabaev, 2017). It is necessary to explore the question of how climaterelated risk-transfer mechanisms, including insurance, can mobilise water-related disaster risk reduction investments and, by so doing, contribute to development. As the focus is on risk transfer, this paper will cover its role in promoting actions and measures that contribute to the reduction of loss and damage caused by waterrelated events and, by extension, disaster risk-reduction measures that provide protection from extreme weather events. This paper does not set out to provide solutions or answers to that question. Rather, it seeks to promote a discussion between the insurance and water sectors around this question.

2 Introduction

Humans have always been exposed to hazards and risks. Arguably, the ability to think ahead and plan for future eventualities is one of the features of human development and is a risk-management strategy. Risks associated with natural disasters have generally been associated with non-human forces – the forces of nature – and, therefore, beyond human agency to control, though the effects may be mitigated. The sociologists Beck and Giddens, with whom the term ‘Risk Society’ (Beck, 1992) is associated, have argued that through the process of modernisation societies are now exposed to risks that are products of that process rather than non-human forces. They contend that ‘manufactured’ risks (Giddens, 1999) are products of an increasingly industrialised society, developments in technology, and human agency, which both produce and mitigate such risks. Climate change comes to mind. One of the features of ‘manufactured’ risk is that much of what we know about it comes from those with specialised knowledge (experts) rather than through direct experience. Beck (1992) held that widespread risks contain a ‘boomerang’ effect in as much as those who were involved in the production of the risk will also be affected by it and, at the same time, are those best placed to address the problem. It also affects those not responsible for the risk.

This has given rise to the concept of ‘wicked problems’ (Conklin, 2006; Rittel and Webber, 1973), which include climate change and natural disasters. So scientific and technological development have catalysed the problems associated with climate change. But, at the same time, we look to science and technology to provide the solutions or at least reduce the risk to manageable proportions. Manufactured risks can lead to global-level inequalities as well as reinforcing more localised inequalities. Here, the distribution of the risks is as much a function of knowledge of the risks as of the consequences of wealth inequalities. Together, these result in “differential access to forms of self-actualisation and empowerment” (Giddens, 1991, p.6), of which access to risk-management options including insurance would be a feature.

The term ‘natural disasters’ deflects us away from their manufactured nature. Disasters are only such when a natural hazard affects human lives and social well-being. A disaster does not happen unless people and infrastructure are vulnerable. Often, that vulnerability is a result of decisions around the development of the built environment and not using information at our disposal appropriately, or ignoring it. And vulnerabilities are being heightened by rapid urbanisation, environmental degradation, and climate change. In most societies there is the idea that individuals have an obligation to look out for the well-being of others, often using the state as an intermediary. Concomitant with this is the expectation that when assistance is needed, it will be provided. Quiggin (2007) observed that, “In an increasingly diverse society, this kind of social solidarity cannot be assumed to exist automatically.”

In this context the role of the state is the management of the risks to society through its various institutions. However, it must be recognised that there are practical limits on the state and the forms in which it enables the management of risk, whether through state, collective, or individual actions. It is a practical impossibility to avoid the consequences of disasters and to manage all associated risks. The state therefore exercises choices that balance the extent to which it manages risks through the delivery of infrastructure with the provision of other forms of social protection and recompense. Conversely, the state through its actions also contributes to the manufactured nature of disasters through failures to address systemic socioeconomic inequalities, allowing poor or inappropriate development and infrastructure, lack of capitals and, in some cases, the outsourcing of its functions. The gaps generated by the state, deliberately or inadvertently, in the provision of social welfare services in the face of disasters, create space for other forms of risk-transfer provision. These are opportunities that non-state transnational actors are taking up increasingly. Hence, there has been a growth in interest in the role that the insurance industry can play in climate and disaster risk reduction. In theory this should lead to a virtuous circle of better social protection interventions. How exactly this can be realised in and through interventions in the water sector is very much an emerging discussion.","Tue, 05 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1108029-11_climate_insurance_perspectives_paper.png?itok=pa-SCoun,"['state', 'insurance', 'development', 'world', 'climate', 'management', 'promoting', 'social', 'waterrelated', 'risks', 'natural', 'disasters', 'associated', 'unlikely', 'risk', 'disaster', 'partners']",

Even when it re-emerged and became a global manufacturing powerhouse, by and large in the Western consciousness the country still remained a land enshrouded in legends and mystery, about which not much is known beyond the Cultural Revolution.

Now, in the 21st century, China is once more truly becoming the author of its own fate. A new technological golden age seems to be dawning, from innovations in AI and 3D printing, to developments in biomedicine and space exploration — both via private investment and State funding. With this new-found confidence, China has also begun to re-connect with its past and create a Chinese version of modernity that it didn’t have the chance to before. And it is doing so in in fascinating ways — sometimes this means reaching back thousands of years, to draw that connection.

In this article, I look at 13 (a lucky number to the Chinese) pieces of new technology that demonstrate in their conception and nomenclature how China is mapping out its gods and traditions in the cyberverse and the stars.

1 Jia Jia

Created by the University of Science and Technology in Hefei, android Jia Jia is equipped with high intelligence as well as the ability to read and respond to signs of emotion. As interviews have shown, she also has a bit of a temperamental personality.

The design of humanoid robots often embodies our ideals of human perfection. Very few places in the world would release an AI assistant in 2017, and present it like a classical maiden. Jia Jia comes with a range of Han Fu (traditional dress of the Han Chinese from around the Tang Dynasty onwards, preceding the Manchu style clothes of the Qing era).

Whether it is down to the popularity of period dramas, or that a modern equivalent is yet to be found, classical beauty appears to remain an ideal in 21st century China.

2 Digital Lishi

Online platforms such as QQ and Taobao are now offering digital hongbao (red envelopes) around Chinese New Year via their apps. This Spring Festival, the Changsha Evening News teamed up with tourist attractions to plant hundreds of virtual hongbao around the city, which consumers could track down and claim using the augmented reality apps on their phones. AliPay and WeChat have enabled customers to plant hongbao in specific locations anywhere in the country for their friends and families, who can then scan and retrieve the money on their end.

Some things rarely change. Different technologies, same customs. The hongfengbao, popularly known as hongbao, or lishi (an older term used by the southern Chinese; ‘laisee‘ in Cantonese), is an old custom of money-gifting in red paper envelopes on felicitous occasions such as births and marriages. There’s even a minor god in the Chinese pantheon, who looks after loose change called Li Shi. The custom is most well-known in its Chinese New Year form, sometimes also adopted by employers to reward their employees.

In fact, the custom’s iconic image — the bright red packets with full-colour or golden nianhua style images — was established during early to mid 20th century thanks to the introduction of mass colour printing and gold foiling. The custom has clearly once again, adapted to new technologies, via software such as apps, AR and Fintech.

3 The Du Kang Gene

In 2011, results of a study by Fudan University scientists were published pertaining the discovery of an “alcohol-resistant” gene in ancient East-Asians linked to the early development of agriculture in Asian civilizations. Researchers dedicated this gene to Du Kang, the Chinese god of wine.

The earliest legends of Du Kang date back to the Xia Dynasty (c. 2070-1600 BCE), and evolved through the ages as the embodiment of his spirit migrated from a quartermaster to political leader to village winemaker, weaving in mythical elements along the way. Today his name has become synonymous with 酒 (jiu, Chinese for alcohol), and is invoked by companies who want their brands to harness the powerful imagery of this symbol of the great ancient tradition of indigenous wine-making.

4 Shenzhou Spacecraft

The Chinese National Manned Space Programme, or project 921, began in 1968, and was renamed the Shenzhou after its successful test launch in 1999. Shenzhou 5 achieved China’s first human orbital flight in 2003. Since then, the Shenzhou 6 to 11 have successfully completed multiple crewed missions that included the first Chinese spacewalk, first female taikonaut sent into space, and several dockings with the Tiangong space labs (see below). The Shenzhou 12 is currently preparing further upgrades to enhance China’s capabilities in manned space missions to the Moon and Mars.

神舟, Shenzhou, meaning divine ark, is a homonym to 神州, the mystic land, or the land of the gods, an archaic term used to refer to the land inhabited by the Han Chinese people. In mythology, it is the land ruled over by the legendary emperor Huang Di, after he united the tribes. Even today, “Shenzhou” is widely used in the media, arts and education as an instantly recognizable term to the Chinese that evokes the land of their illustrious civilization.

5 Mozi Satellite

The world’s first quantum communications satellite, the Quantum Experiments at Space Scale (QUESS), developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in partnership with Austria (IQOQI Vienna), was launched in 2016. Said to be the world’s first hack-proof satellite, it aims to provide quantum communications between Earth and space.

This satellite is also known as the Micius or Mozi Satellite. Mo Zi was a scientist and philosopher born in 470 BCE, who wrote about logic, geometry, and mechanics as well as basic concepts of linear optics in his famous classic, the Mo Jing, or Classic of Mo Zi. The naming of the satellite after Mo Zi is a fitting tribute to the forerunner of the study of optics in China, which eventually lead to the development of quantum optics and to the building of this satellite.

6 Xue Long

Designed by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation and Finland-based Aker Arctic Technology, the icebreaker Xue Long 2 is scheduled to be completed in 2019 and to join the Xue Long 1 on scientific research missions and the supply of resources to the polar regions. Together they will be the world’s first icebreakers to go on polar explorations using a two-way ice-breaking technology.

雪龙, Xue Long, means Snow Dragon. China isn’t the only country with dragon totems, but no other civilization has been so closely associated with this mythical creature. What makes long, the Chinese dragon, distinctive from Western dragons is that it symbolizes wisdom, power and good fortune. Like the long, which is made up of many parts (the features of nine animals), the Xue Long 2 is made up of 11 giant sections, to be assembled into one. And like the mythical dragon, it can soar in its element, breaking ice of up to 1.5m thick, functioning at -30C temperatures, and quickly changing direction in ice.

7 Tiangong Space Station

Launched in 2011, the Tiangong-1 is a single module space laboratory and station run by the China National Space Administration with the primary goal of practicing spacecraft dockings to prepare for future explorations of the solar system. Tiangong-2 launched in 2016. Between them they have completed multiple docking missions with various models of the Shenzhou and Tianzhou-1, a cargo and refuelling spacecraft. Tiangong-1’s data has also helped in China’s mineral discoveries, forest and ocean monitoring, and flood control.

天宫, Tian Gong, means Heavenly Palace, which the ancient Chinese imagined were celestial abodes of the immortals. Today, even though stark constructions of assembled circuitry, computers and titanium alloys are sent into space, the Chinese still attach to them the same sense of awe; taikonauts such as Yang Liwei and Liu Yang are immortalized in civilizational history by their journeys to the skies and their sojourn in the celestial experimental module of these bionic heavenly palaces.

8 Lunar Chang’E Probe and YuTu Rover

After a thirty-year delay, China finally launched CLEP, its lunar space programme, in 2007. Its series of three probes have so far completed 3D mapping of the entire lunar surface, Earth-moon transfer orbit, and first lunar soft-landing since 1976, completing a patrol survey and successful return. The rover that landed with the third probe in 2013, stayed in operation for a record-breaking length of time. This year, the fourth probe is set to carry out the previously unprecedented mission of exploring the far side of the moon.

Due to China’s peculiar history, its people did not live through the first moon landing in 1969 with the joy and anticipation that the rest of the world shared. For centuries however, the Chinese have gazed up at the celestial orb and imagined spirits living there. The oldest of these being a toad and a rabbit; and the most famous is Chang’E, Lady of the Moon, whose image, along with that of the Jade Rabbit, still fill the media and adorn cakes on China’s harvest festival (Mid-Autumn Festival) every year.

Chang’E was once a goddess banished to earth with her husband Hou Yi, the legendary archer. She ascended the moon, after swallowing the elixirs of immortality granted to them by Xi Wang Mu, the Supreme Goddess. Different eras in history have woven in conflicting strands of the Chang’E myth, but she lives on in the Chinese psyche as a symbol of human endeavours to reach for the skies, a spirit encapsulated in China’s naming of its lunar probes the Chang’E. The probe’s rover could have no other name than YuTu (Jade Rabbit), Chang’E’s faithful companion.

In fact, just at the end of last month, China launched the Queqiao, a relay satellite to prepare for the moon expedition of Chang’E 4. The Queqiao, 鹊桥 or Magpie Bridge, draws from another myth, one of the four great legends of China, that of Niu Lang and Zhi Nü, the Cowherd and the Weaver. It’s the tale of forbidden love between goddess and mortal, and sympathetic magpies building a bridge across the galaxy for the star-crossed lovers to meet on the one day of year they are permitted to.

The tradition of celebrating Qi Xi, 七夕, or the 7th day of the 7th month in the lunar calendar, has been revived in recent years as the “Chinese Valentine’s Day”, with many choosing to wed in traditional style. The day is also celebrated as Qi Qiao, the Festival of Skills, in honour of the goddess’ trade on earth, with many cosplayers donning their traditional style costumes. We wish the Queqiao satellite a successful rendezvous with Chang’E 4.

10 BIT Nezha

In April this year, at the Shanghai International Technology Expo, the Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) unveiled a new robot developed by its Department of Automation: Nezha. Each of the four legs of the pod-shaped robot is made up of 6 electric cylinders, with a wheel attached to the bottom. All 24 cylinders and the wheels work in coordination with the Nezha’s GPS, environmental censors, laser radar, and navigation systems to ensure that the robot can move steadily, with speed and accuracy, while carrying very heavy loads.

The naming of this robot after the child god Ne Zha, is an allusion to his signature weapon, the Wind Fire Wheels. Ne Zha entered Chinese culture around the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) via Buddhism and evolved his distinct identity as an immortal sent from heaven to protect the human world against the surge of demons. His earthly existence is brief and violent, but he transforms into a powerful guardian of heaven when he attains his immortal form.

The protector spirit of Ne Zha certainly seems to manifest itself in the BIT robot. Like the deity it is small but mighty, and its foreseeable uses are not only in the military sphere but also in social care for the disabled and disaster relief — all in all, the protection of humanity.

10 Feng Huo Lun (Hoverboards)

The self-balancing, two-wheel electric scooters, also known as hoverboards, were originally invented by Chinese-American entrepreneur and founder of Inventist in Washington, Shane Chen, and branded the Hovertrax. The factories of Shenzhen emulated this design, quickly producing hundreds of similar products in many sizes and styles. After a couple of celebrity posts about them on social media went viral, hoverboards became the must-have gadget of Christmas 2015.

Their illegality on the roads and pavements of Britain and other European countries hasn’t reduced their popularity in youth culture. The pirated nature of this gadget, which can only be purchased online or at sketchy-looking stalls, has lent it an edgy image, emphasized by its nickname in Chinese. Rather than 滑板 “huaban” (gliding board) or 电动平衡车 “diandong pingheng che” (electronic balancing vehicle), it’s better known as the 风火轮 “fenghuolun“, Wind Fire Wheels, tapping into an alternate version of the child god Ne Zha that has evolved from his presentation in video games.

Although he’s thousands of years old, the nihilistic nature and hot-headed fierceness of this deity makes him eternally relevant to unruly, punky youths.

11 Jiaolong Nuclear-Powered Mobile Deep-Sea Station

A Chinese company is developing this for the China Ship Scientific Research Centre. Set to be launched in 2030, the 60-metre long craft, weighing 2,600 tonnes, will be manned by 33 crew members and powered by a nuclear reactor, with a mission to mine for precious metals and oil.

The current test model of this colossal deep-sea construction is named after the Jiao Long, a mythical water beast with the blood of a dragon, described in historical texts as having four claws, the head of a horse, scales, whiskers and horns. Soaring through both the oceans and the skies, it controls the wind and rain and can change size at will. I hope the Jiao Long test model will prove as agile as the creature from which it takes its name, and hold up well against the turbulent maritime weather.

12 “Monkey King” Dark Matter Detector

In 2015, China launched its first space observatory, the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE), to help find the origins of dark matter, which could make up five-sixths of all the matter in the universe. Capable of measuring up to 2 trillion electron volts of energy, the DAMPE is designed to detect cosmic rays and gamma rays (which dark matter is believed to break down into), and to shed light on their source.

The DAMPE is nicknamed the Wukong Satellite, after Sun Wukong, the powerful monkey spirit, also known as the Monkey King, from the 16thcentury classic Journey to the West. Wukong is the name given to the Monkey King by his Daoist master, meaning “to understand the void”. Even in China’s space age, the country still calls upon on this timeless protector and guiding spirit to help it gain an understanding of the unknown — and fill the void in humanity’s knowledge.

The Monkey King is famous for having sight beyond sight, eyes that allow him to see the true form of any of the hundreds of demons he takes on in order to protect his master on their quest for the holy scriptures. Centuries later, his spirit is now guiding the Chinese to dark matter in its true form.

13 Wenchang Space Launch Centre

With its inaugural launch of the CZ-7 Rocket in 2016, the WSLC in Hainan is set to gradually replace Xichang Satellite Launch Centre as China’s 21st century portal to space, supporting spacecraft launches, spacestation operations, and commercial telecommunication satellites, as well as deep space missions to the Moon and Mars.

The launch centre is named after Lord Wenchang, the Chinese god of scholarly success, whose life, interestingly, also began in the stars. The Wenchang Stars is the name given by the ancient Chinese to a constellation adjacent to the North Star. Veneration of this deity developed through the centuries from local earth god worship, to eventually become nationwide, gaining endorsement even from the emperor himself.

Today, temples still fill with offerings from students of all ages and anyone wishing to succeed in the world, with a range of services and merchandise supporting several other industries. The huge abundance of faith across China in Lord Wenchang has propelled this mammoth deity into the 21st century, to watch over scientists and explorers, the scholars of space, on their most challenging endeavours.

Author: Whitney Leach, Formative Content

Forewarned is forearmed.

That seems to be the sentiment behind a new tool developed to identify the cities most at risk of flooding as the ice sheets melt.

The interactive tool, known as Gradient Fingerprint Mapping (GFM), was developed by scientists at NASA’s renowned Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.

Their invention predicts which areas of ice may contribute to sea level changes in individual cities.

This provides researchers with unprecedented insight into which ice sheets (and cities) they should be “most worried about”.

The tool works by taking into account the Earth’s rotation and gravitational effects to paint a broader picture of how certain melting points impact cities. Users of the tool can then pick from 293 cities to see how melting ice structures might affect different coastal regions.

According to scientists involved in its development, what makes GFM particularly unique is its ability to pinpoint the areas of ice that might impact particular cities.

As Dr Eric Larour from NASA explains: “We can compute the exact sensitivity – for a specific town – of a sea level to every ice mass in the world.”

The predictions are not without their surprises, however. For instance, proximity is not the ultimate indicator of which glaciers should spark the most concern.

According to the researchers, New York City actually faces the biggest threat from Greenland’s northeast glaciers (those furthest away). By contrast, the northwestern region of Greenland’s ice sheet should be of most concern to Londoners.","Mon, 04 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://europeansting.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/ice-melting-un-2018.jpg,"['ice', 'sea', 'shows', 'impact', 'melting', 'sheets', 'flood', 'level', 'scientists', 'melt', 'researchers', 'cities', 'tool']", 
75,75,FL-2018-000068-CHN,The ARC plans to insure 30 African countries against climate risks by 2020 - D+C Development and Cooperation,https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/arc-plans-insure-30-african-countries-against-climate-risks-2020,"Africans are increasingly exposed to climate risks, because draughts, floods and storms get ever more forceful. The African Risk Capacity takes a promising innovative approach to managing these risks. The idea is to use insurance to prevent natural disasters from becoming humanitarian disasters.

According to Nigeria’s National Emergency Management Agency, the financial cost of the 2012 flooding amounted to 2.6 trillion naira (the equivalent of more than $ 5.8 billion) across the country. Housing and agriculture were the worst affected sectors. The crisis made people and communities suffer, and the huge financial loss highlights the scale of the natural disaster. The burden is so great that the affected communities will feel it for many years. They were unable to repair the damage fast because they simply did not have the money they needed.

In Africa, droughts, floods and cyclones have been wreaking havoc in communities across the continent. For example, a severe drought affected the whole of east Africa in 2011 and 2012. As a result, over 9.5 million people experienced harsh food shortages. The event triggered a refugee crisis. In February last year, storm Dino destroyed 20,000 homes in Mozambique.

Climate change means that extreme weather is occurring more frequently, so African nations are exposed to ever growing risks. The grim reality is that disasters are recurrent, so some people are likely to be traumatised again and again.

No doubt, Africa must prepare for climate change. The challenge is to build the resilience of vulnerable communities and deliver timely assistance when they need support. These issues are not trivial. Many people dismiss the capability of Africa to rise to this and other daunting challenges. They say leaders lack the political will and the competence for the kind of effective policymaking that might unlock the required resources.

That perception is overblown. Some progress is being made. In 2012, for example, policymakers came together under the aegis of the African Union (AU), and founded the Africa Risk Capacity (ARC). It is a specialised agency for financing climate resilience and crisis response. It consists of two arms, the AU Specialised Agency and the ARC Insurance Company. The ARC Agency focuses on building capacity within African member states for risk management and provides the necessary tools to support such work. This includes the provision of an early warning tool called Africa RiskView, which is linked to predefined contingency plans. The second arm of ARC, the Insurance Company, issues contracts to governments which serve to finance predefined contingency plans in the event of a disaster.

The ARC Insurance Company started out with a 20 year returnable no-interest loan of $ 200 million in risk capital from the governments of Germany and the United Kingdom. The ARC objective is to provide African countries with funds immediately when disasters strike. This kind of first-response assistance should reduce Africa’s dependency on humanitarian aid. It is an important component of disaster preparedness.

Africa RiskView does not only provide early warning. Its risk-modelling platform can be used to define parameters for disbursing insurance benefits. When satellite data indicates that a drought has occurred, the ARC thus pays at short notice. The process is automated, so the disaster response is timely.

The ARC has been operational for some time. No less than 33 countries have signed up to it. Nigeria is one. Not all, however, have joined the insurance scheme as paying clients.

The initial risk pool consisted of Kenya, Mauretania, Niger and Senegal. The scheme started in the rainfall seasons of 2014/15. The client countries paid insurance premiums worth $ 19 million, and the first set of insurance payouts was made in January 2015, totalling $ 26 million. The beneficiaries were Mauritania, Niger and Senegal because these countries were affected by drought.

However, the ARC can and will do more. The target is to insure 30 countries against drought, flood and cyclone disasters by 2020. This translates to up to $ 1.5 billion in coverage for some 150 million people. For this to happen, African governments must actively participate in the pool and pay premiums. The role of donors is also critical, not only in providing capital but in supporting premium financing for the fiscally most constrained countries.

It is important to understand that the ARC is actually a cost-reducing instrument. By making money available immediately, it reduces the costs of disasters. If a crisis is not responded to fast, the damages and costs keep growing. According to estimates, every dollar spent by the insurance right away saves nearly $ 4.5 dollars that would otherwise have to be spent later.

The ARC is an innovative and promising institution. The question arises whether it will perform well in the long term. Africa has a reputation of being a graveyard of good initiatives – and the reasons are lack of awareness, cynicism and governments’ inability to put their money where their mouth is. If they do not pay the premiums, their nations will not enjoy insurance coverage.



The continent least protected by insurances

Part of the challenge is that Africans are generally somewhat insurance-averse. This form of risk management actually requires a certain level of prosperity. It means to spend money on something one hopes one will not need. The point of an insurance policy is to be able to cope with an unlikely disaster that would be utterly devastating should it occur. Because more customers buy insurance than ultimately need it, the insurance company can cover the damages and make a profit nonetheless. Basically, an insurance scheme spreads the costs of damages over many households. Individual risks are thus managed in a collective way.

In African countries, only the upper and middle classes are prosperous enough to even consider investing in insurances they hope they will not need. This is the world’s least insurance-protected region. People’s prevailing attitude, therefore, does not support the ARC.

This challenge can be surmounted. Policymakers are able to understand the cost-benefit analysis. Such understanding could – and should – be reinforced by peer reviews in the context of NEPAD (New Partnership for Africa’s Development) with regard to protecting citizens from natural disasters. The process would also leverage local-level advocacy. It is important to raise awareness. Civil-society organisations should endorse the ARC because it serves to protect vulnerable communities. The point is to ensure that a natural disaster does not become a humanitarian one.

It must be acknowledged, nonetheless, that some governments will find it hard to pay the insurance premiums. Commodity prices are currently depressed, so the budgets of many commodity-exporting countries are strained. Governments are struggling to meet existing commitments. However, they must consider the sheer impact of natural disasters. Including insurance as part of their risk management strategy makes sense because it allows countries to cope with otherwise devastating events that would strain the public purse much more than comparatively small premiums do. The financial and humanitarian costs of natural disasters far outweigh the insurance expenditure. The smart priority is to set aside small sums to pay premiums in order to be able to deliver quick and effective assistance to people when needed.

African philanthropists should consider the ARC too. Donations to the ARC are welcome and can have huge impacts. In response to Nigeria’s 2012 flood crisis, the country’s billionaires were mobilised to contribute to meeting the humanitarian needs. Such an ad-hoc approach cannot deliver assistance fast enough however.

Strong private-sector businesses use insurance schemes to manage their risks. Accordingly, private-sector leaders should endorse the ARC mechanism as well. In the long term, an obligatory, legally coded system is stronger than mere charity.

There is ample scope for private-public partnerships in the ARC context. Every member government should set up a central office to coordinate resource mobilisation for ARC premiums. They should involve the private sector in this effort. This way, Africa can leverage the recent successes in private-sector development and reduce the dependence on foreign donors.

The ARC has a governance structure that represents its stakeholders. Signatories to the initiative make up the Conference of Parties, the agency’s main governance body. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala chairs the governing board. She is Nigeria’s former finance minister and former top manager of the World Bank. Her international reputation is good.

The ARC is set to prove that a little external assistance combined with the resources of African governments and increased private-sector prosperity can deliver disaster relief and support recovery. Africa can become more resilient – and it must do so, given the outlook of growing climate risks.





Chinedu Moghalu was recently appointed head of communication and advocacy for the African Risk Capacity (ARC).

76,76,FL-2018-000068-CHN,"Some of Modi’s shine has come off, but he has a good scorecard: Chris Leahy - Livemint",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/RDxXYNvD4J2o53a2ffYDeL/Some-of-Modis-shine-has-come-off-but-he-has-a-good-scoreca.html,"Singapore: India has been seeing record inflows in terms of private equity (PE) in the past couple of years, as the Narendra Modi-led government has undertaken reforms that have improved the country’s macroeconomic picture, and this has resonated well with the investor community, Chris Leahy, co-founder of Blackpeak (Holdings), said in an interview.

“It (India) has favourable demographics. It is the only country in Asia that has similar demographics to China, and is much less developed—arguably, the opportunities are there,"" he said, while adding that investors believed in the India story, and from the macroeconomic perspective, it would be difficult for them not to bet on India.

At the same time, Leahy warned that the flood of capital coming in could also cause problems—from unscrupulous promoters who divert money, or having to pay off local politicians and government officials, to high valuations. Edited excerpts:

For PE, 2017 has been the best year for both investments and exits in India, surpassing their respective previous highs. When funds from Singapore are investing in India, and do deals where, what are they asking you?

First, it is promoter risk—‘who am I getting into a deal with’? For a majority of deals, the funds are picking up a minority, or a large minority (in the company) as part of the transaction and, therefore, especially in the case of private equity, you are taking a long-term risk on a family, or a person, or a group of people. You are entering into a long-term relationship with them.

Second, people are concerned about corruption, particularly at the government level in the states—at the federal level. PE is concerned about business risks, the functionality and the ability to execute across such a vast country. But promoter risk is number one—and you’ve seen that play out lately in India with the likes of Nirav Modi, Vijay Mallya and several others—although not all of these may be PE-linked.

In terms of promoter risk, for China, South-East Asia and India, it is different from the West, where for reasons of history and development, the level of institutional investment in companies is far greater. Due to the rapid development of economies in Asia, a lot of these non-conglomerate companies have grown up, and are run by families, especially in India, and it is very much the case of the Chinese diaspora in South-East Asia (SEA).

In China, you have a very different kind of risk in state-owned entities—that is a different kind of animal, and is more recent. Understanding the cultural differences and the way people in different countries think and react - that is part of putting together a successful deal with private equity. We assist in understanding some of these.

In the seven years that you’ve looked at India, have PE investors become a lot wiser? Now, they are looking at board seats, path to control, targets that their portfolio companies need to meet, rather than just getting into the deal with a minority stake like we saw during the first wave of investments before the global financial crisis.

On the whole, yes. I think PE now is far more likely to employ firms like us to help them do deals in markets like India. Yet, when valuations gets too high, and there’s too much dry powder in market which drives competition, then PE may still rush to get into deals—but generally, the processes of evaluating companies have become better. Regulations have helped a bit—Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) has done a good job over the last couple of years to hold more companies accountable. So I think, even for firms in the unlisted space, there has been a rubbing off effect from that. By-and-large, it’s improved—It has not become a lot easier to do deals, as it has become very competitive—Indian entrepreneurs are notorious for driving a hard bargain, and there are still problems associated with disputes, corruption issues…

Despite all these concerns and challenges you’ve mentioned, does the wave multifold increase in investment flow in 2017 suggest PE firms are also driven by the fear of missing out, as India is among the few market that can absorb the dry powder and offers large deals?

I think it’s a confluence of things. You saw the quick change of investor sentiment when Modi came in—he was seen as being investor-friendly. Modi has made things happen quite quickly, and investors liked it. The macroeconomic picture in India has improved. It has favourable demographics. It is the only country in Asia that has similar demographics to China, and is much less developed—arguably, the opportunities are there. But you still have the same problems when you have a flood of money coming into developing market—it is very easy for that money to be mis-allocated—from unscrupulous promoters who divert money, or having to pay off local politicians and government officials—generally speaking, investors may be overpaying. But for investors, they believe in the India story, and from the macroeconomic perspective, it is difficult not to bet on India. The problem is not whether I should put my money into India or not, but, how do I find investments, and where do I find the right deals—because everyone is trying to do the same. That played out in China as well—it is still playing out.

What is your take on the four years of the Modi-led government?

Some of the shine has come off. But, by-and-large, he has got a good scorecard. There has been unpleasantness around some of the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) activities—but, India is a complicated place. By and large, Modi is still seen as pro-business and investor friendly, and therefore people are still trying to put money in India, and they are still positive. You’ve got to remember, India is similar to China in population, but you are accountable in a democracy. India is democracy unlike China, and that comes at a price. The attitude about India and China is that, India has paid the price for being a democracy, and China has yet to pay, and that will come—it’s easy to build roads and world-class infrastructure in an extremely powerful one-party state where you have absolute control. You can’t do that in India—it’s a difficult country to govern. Whoever runs India, it will always be a difficult job—a lot of compromises and haggling and deal-making is needed.

For investors, how critical is that the BJP-led government or a strong government comes back? Or does India have own economic cycle, irrespective of the strength of the government in the centre?

If it is not Modi-led, it has to be some similar form of an investor friendly government. It is a vast country with several states, but the central government is playing an increasingly important role of setting the agenda. Investors don’t like to change. People are positive to the changes the Modi-led government brought in, and want more of the same. People understand and investors have seen what can happen, and how quickly things can go badly wrong—they are sensitive to that issue, and want stability.

Sitting here in Singapore, if an investor were to ask you where to put their monies—would you recommend South-East Asia, China or India?

It’s impossible to ignore China. The issue is what to invest in, and how to address the China market. We have clients that avoid anything to do with the government in China and only invest in private firms and controlled deals. Others are prepared to take a bigger picture view and will invest in growth capital and pre-IPO investments. But if you are looking at an Asia exposure, it is impossible to ignore the two behemoths—China and India. Then you start to look at other interesting countries—Indonesia is still attractive, but it is difficult to do deals, its government is a bit flip-flopping. Malaysia is completely up in the air at the moment with the change in the regime, Vietnam is fairly attractive and lots of Singapore money is pouring in, as it is seen as a mini-China. By and large, looking at developing Asia, it is extremely positive—it is not about finding the deals and understanding the risk with those transactions.

So when it comes to finding deals, with so many funds chasing the same deals, is it not pushing valuations to all-time highs—will we see corresponding returns?

As long as capital markets stay open, strong as they are, I don’t see an end to increasing valuations. People are looking for yield—markets are open and companies can fund themselves, they can borrow money, they can refinance, and they can go to market, and exits are more achievable—so they use exits to drive up M&A prices, and even the private market is a good source for deals. As long as that happens, I don’t see much of that slow down, and valuations will continue to rise. Is it going to end in tears? It might eventually—I would imagine the vintages of PE funds maturing in the next five years will be much more challenging than the previous 5-7 years, where a lot of more financial engineering was possible. While some of the valuations you see are heroic, we are yet to see too many of them fall over, but if you have 2-3 very high profile LBOs turn sour, the sentiments can change very quickly. But we may see this more likely to play out in US or Europe than Asia, because you have a different growth trajectory here, and the organic growth that you see in Asian firms can probably help support higher levels of leverage. Ultimately, they will come to a point where there are not enough deals to go around, and valuations will get to a point where they are unsustainable. Will that lead to a crash? Not necessarily, but it will lead to the closure of some of the PE firms, which is happening already. You should see that—there is some kind of bifurcation in the industry—the bigger PE firms are just getting bigger and bigger, and you’ve got a lot of niche firms—but middle market funds are struggling to get to scale.

Yes, the bigger PE firms are getting bigger, and at the same time, we are seeing a lot pension and sovereign money also chasing deals. Also, many of global PE firms today have Asia-specific, or China-specific and even India-centric funds. How does that change the PE landscape?

Yes, the Canadian pension funds, and others like Temasek are big investors now. For the PE landscape, the big LPs have learnt from the GPs, and they are beginning to write their own terms, and one of the first things they seek is co-investments. While this has been around for a long time, it is increasingly the case with the more sophisticated LPs – they are almost competing with GPs, they are also having a say in the deals the GP does.

SEA and India have several sector-agnostic PE firms? What is their future?

Not very rosy – many of them won’t be able to scale and raise new funds, and will have to close. There’s strong demand at the top of market for allocations with some of the biggest funds. When people launch new funds, generally speaking, unless they are a major name, it takes a long time, it’s difficult, and the founding team may be required to put in matching fund requirements and negotiate very hard. Historically, we’ve hand fund-of-funds structure, but that market is less active now than it was a few years ago. So, some of them have to rely on family offices and below - that’s not an easy market to tap. Ultimately, the ones that are successful are the ones that have produced outsized returns - they have produced Alpha and they outperform their peer group, and gradually they built up their track record - because all of these stories of the big PE firms started out as small firms many years ago - maybe it was easier then, and it is a more difficult environment now - while it is not impossible to do it even today, it will take a really long time, and one has to be very disciplined to grow the PE business. If you are just providing growth capital, and are a small regional sector agnostic PE player, it is difficult to differentiate, and a lot of different type of funds are out to eat your lunch. I see a lot of funds in the credit space, or the structured credit space chasing PE deals – they’ve come into the market only in the last 10 years, and some of these funds do deals very quickly, and they are added competition. You need a very clear and compelling strategy and mission and objectives to attract LPs – you just can’t run on the mid-cap or growth-cap sector agnostic Asia play to attract sufficient LPs that can get you to a place where you can sustain yourself – once you hit that level, then it is about execution and performance.

77,77,FL-2018-000068-CHN,Conspiracy Nuts Flood the DNC's Lawsuit Against Russia - The Daily Beast,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-dncs-lawsuit-against-the-russians-became-a-conspiracy-magnet,"The election interference lawsuit Democrats filed last April against Russia and the Donald Trump campaign is becoming a magnet for other aggrieved parties working to expose their own conspiracy theories.

In the last two months the court docket in Democratic National Committee v. The Russian Federation et al has been virtually overrun with dozens of filings by two conspiracy theorists, one who believes Trump-Russia is in the center of a conspiracy that resulted in the bank repossession of his home, and the other a New Orleans man warning that the U.S. government let loose a chemical weapon during Hurricane Katrina.

Available on the web for 10 cents a page, federal court dockets in newsworthy cases, like those linked to Russiagate, are followed slavishly by hundreds if not thousands of journalists and devotees of law.

“It is not that easy to get on social media when you’re talking about the things I’m talking about,” said one of the filers, David Andrew Christenson, in an interview with The Daily Beast. “My only outlet, I realized a long time ago, would be the courts.”

A 60-year-old Navy veteran from New Orleans, Christenson saw his house condemned after Hurricane Katrina hit the area in 2005. He believes, based largely on self-guided research, that a deadly chemical weapons agent that he’s dubbed the “Katrina Virus” was released from top-secret CIA and Defense Department facilities during the hurricane, and has been quietly chalking up a global body count ever since.

Christenson has been featured in conspiracy blogs, and is the author of seven titles available on Amazon, including The New York Times and the Supreme Court Are Murdering Mankind via Direct and Indirect Suicide(s). The End Result Will be the Genocide and the Extinction of Mankind via the Katrina Virus, and An American Born Terrorist’s Emails To The Department of Justice, which consists of 422 pages from Christenson’s outbox.

Christenson said he turned to court filings as a last resort after his YouTube channel, Twitter account, and website were all shut down, and his direct outreach to government officials got him arrested on suspicion of cyberstalking an FBI agent (he was released with no charges after about two weeks in jail). He estimates that he’s filed motions and letters in about 100 different cases over the years, though most judges have taken a dim view of his efforts. In February, a committee of federal judges in Chicago took the unusual step of blocking Christenson’s email addresses entirely from the court’s system, complaining that his emails were “straining judicial resources.”

When Robert Mueller started handing down indictments last year, Christenson hit those cases like a graffiti artist on a freshly painted wall. “Everything Mueller has brought I’ve filed in,” he said. But the Washington, D.C., court handling most of them is taking a hard line on docket spam, and virtually none of Christenson’s motions have made it into the case record. “The Court recognizes that the movant sincerely believes that he has information to share that bears on this case, and that, understandably, he wishes to be heard,” wrote Judge Amy Berman Jackson in a minute note last November in the Paul Manafort case. “There are many places and means available for a private citizen to express his views about matters of public interest, but the fact is, the Court’s docket is not one of them.”

Last March, Christenson’s “Emergency Motion to Intervene Filed on Behalf of All Americans” slipped onto the Manafort docket, and Jackson dignified the filing—a screed against Mueller—with a formal ruling denying the motion. At the same time, Jackson ordered that no further Christenson filings would be permitted into the case.

But the judge overseeing the Democratic National Committee’s civil lawsuit in New York, John Koeltl, has been more tolerant, and Christenson has filed 30 letters and motions by U.S. mail in six weeks. “The continuing cover-up of what happened in New Orleans will ensure the Genocide of Mankind,” he wrote in one. In another: “If we don’t change the narrative Mankind will cease to exist by October 12th, 2050. This is not a prophecy or prediction but a mathematical certainty.”

“There’s two court cases now where they’ve sort of given me carte blanche,” said Christenson. “There’s this one, and there the BP Oil Spill appeal of mine to the 5th Circuit… It took me a long time to get to this point. I’m putting everything in writing and putting it in the docket.”

Christenson isn’t the only one using the Russiagate lawsuit as a soapbox. He’s competing for eyeballs with Patrick Farrell, a Florida man whose two filings place both Trump and Russia in a complicated conspiracy that he says resulted in a bank foreclosure on his home, and that involves “the Jews.” He credits his own whistle-blowing with spawning the entire Robert Mueller investigation, and writes that he’s faced retaliation ever since.

One of Farrell’s filings concludes on this note: “WHEREFORE, I the Living Man, demand this court to monetary award for a 10 year frivolous filing, leave to amend and jury trial.”

Christenson has encountered Farrell before on other cases, and doesn’t think much of his work. “I run into him all the time,” he said. He confesses he even harbors suspicions that Farrell is part of a government plot to discredit Christenson’s filings. “He may not exist.”","Sun, 17 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT","https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1529197081/180617-poulsen-dnc-russia-conspiracy-hero_ihaowj","['conspiracy', 'nuts', 'christensons', 'christenson', 'cases', 'filed', 'court', 'flood', 'dncs', 'hes', 'docket', 'filings', 'lawsuit', 'mankind', 'russia']",

Besides heavy rainfall, high tide in low lying areas also contributed to the flooding, Soriano said in an interview with AM radio station DZBB.

Anyone who would want to go to Hermosa, which is submerged in waist-high flood, would need a boat, Soriano said.

According to her, residents there, particularly in Barangay Almacen, are used to flooding. So those with two-storey house would just move to the second floor, while those with single-storey house would move in with relatives with two-storey houses.

Despite the flooding in Bataan, Soriano noted that no untoward incident and evacuees were reported.

According to the data of the PDRRMO, the following areas are flooded.

Dinalupihan

Mabini Extension: 2 to 3 feet

Padre Dandan: 1 to 2 feet

Santa Isabel 1 to 1.5 feet

Hermosa

Barangay Almacen: 4 to 4.5 feet

Barangay Daungan: 3 to 3.5 feet

Barangay Pulo: 3 feet

Sitio Maligaya: 2 feet

On December 1, 2015 Chennai and its surrounding regions experienced an unprecedented, heavy rainfall. In a region where the average rainfall during the season is expected to be 8-10 mm per day, one of the rain gauges in the city recorded an abnormally high, 494 mm, rainfall over 24 hours that day. This led to death of nearly 250 people, and Chennai was declared a ‘disaster zone’. There have been attempts to explain this phenomenon of how clouds remained stationary over this region, continuously giving rain over 24 hours. In a first, Jayesh Phadtare of Centre for Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, links the presence of the Eastern Ghats to this phenomenon, in a paper published in Monthly Weather Review.

Cold pool

When clouds give out water droplets, the droplets evaporate mid-air, as they fall down. This cools the surrounding air, forming a cold pool of air which sinks down and flows horizontally. “The gusty cold wind that heralds an approaching thunderstorm is nothing but a cold pool, which plays a pivotal role in cloud dynamics.” says Jayesh.

Unlike the Western Ghats, which run close to the west coast of India, the Eastern Ghats are nearly 200 km away from the coast. Therefore, the link between the mountains’ orography and the rainfall over the region is not obvious, and this is the first study to link the two. Jayesh, who is studying cloud propagation over the Indian region, could see the connection by observing satellite images: “In Kalpana-I satellite images, I saw that the clouds that gave so much rain over Chennai on 1 December 2015 moved from Bay of Bengal to the coast and became stationary there,” he says. Realising that the Eastern Ghats must be having a role in this, he went on to study a model of the system. “The interaction between mountains, clouds and cold pools became clear after performing the model experiments,” he adds, in an email to The Hindu.

According to the model, the cold pool was obstructed by the Eastern Ghats from flowing downward. Hence it piled up and remained stationary over the Chennai region. “The reason for the clouds remaining stationary was that there was a balance between the piling of cold pool along the mountain and the winds from the bay. This does not happen in all heavy rainfall incidences over Chennai,” says Jayesh.

Sensitivity experiments were done to check this model. In the experimental model in which the orography was absent, the winds just swept downstream and the clouds moved inland. In the model where the evaporative cooling was removed, the cold pool did not form at all and the clouds moved over the Ghats.

Dust storms

Cold pools are known to play an important role in the dust storms (Aandhi) that form in northern India. They form by the evaporation of raindrops. This process is more efficient in the drier and warmer environment as there is lot of scope of evaporation. So, the cold pools that form in these conditions, are deeper and more vigorous. “As pre-monsoon conditions in north India are very dry and warm, cold pools that accompany the pre-monsoon thunderstorms there are far more destructive, causing widespread damages,” says Jayesh. For the first time, this study links cold pools and the mountain structure to explain rainfall over south India.

Though the primary aim of the study is to explain the anomalous rainfall over Chennai on December 1, 2015, ""the understanding gained from this analysis can be useful for improving the general weather forecast over this region,” the author writes in the paper.","Sat, 09 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/mhca1f/article24122665.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10TH-SCICHENNAI-RAIN,"['cold', 'dec', 'clouds', 'rainfall', 'region', 'model', 'chennai', 'downpour', 'pool', 'eastern', 'pools', 'caused', '2015', 'ghats']",

CNN was not immediately able to reach Nike for comment.

Counterfeit industry

The decision is sure to fuel the market for counterfeit jerseys. Fake versions of the Nigeria kit have been openly on sale in Nigeria for at least a month.

CNN recently visited a bustling business district of downtown Lagos and found shops selling replica versions of several World Cup kits including Brazil and England.

A counterfeit kit seller sorts her wares in her shop in Lagos on May 31 2018 ahead of the official release of the Nigeria World Cup kit.

The replica jerseys are made in Thailand, one of the sellers told us and were selling for between $20 to $40 depending on the quality, while more lower grades can go for around $5.

Seller Ronke Oni told CNN the anticipation for kits before they were released on Friday fueled demand for the replicas.

""People started buying the 1994 US World Cup jersey a lot when the new Nigeria jersey didn't come out early. I got the new Nigeria jersey last month from Thailand. It sells faster and it's cheaper. The most popular one is the home jersey. It's hotcake right now.""

Oni told CNN she mostly sells the fake jerseys online and via social media.

""Most Nigerians, I don't think can afford the original,"" she said. ""The replica is the same as the original, except you look closely at it.""

Some analysts think that Nike waited too long to make the kits available and created space for bootleggers like Oni to cash in on demand.

Sport journalist Godwin Dudu-Orumen, who runs a sports academy in Lagos, said: ""The kits are not readily available. If I want to buy one and I can't find it, more than likely the man on the street will go for the one that's fake. They need to ensure that the kit arrives in good time, don't wait until expectations are climbing.""

""Four to six weeks ago, someone asked me but I didn't know where to get one and now fake kits are being sold on the streets. You can dilute that demand by making the kit available in good time.""

Football kit economies

Kits deals can be highly lucrative to football federations.

The Nigeria Football Football Federation (NFF) entered into a three-and-half-year partnership with Nike to make the country's kits in 2015. The deal was worth $3.75m and a $500,000 bonus if the ""Super Eagles"" qualified for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, according to Goal.com.

The NFF previously had a deal with German sportswear brand Adidas, joining countries such as Australia, Brazil, England, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa, the US and South Korea.

Meanwhile England's 12-year kit deal with Nike is reportedly worth $457 million.

Recently the NFF complained about how counterfeiters can potentially ruin such lucrative deals.

""The people who will criticise the NFF for not getting a so-called big sponsorship kit deal are the same ones who will undermine our ability to do so by buying the counterfeit jerseys,"" NFF head Shehu Dikko said in an interview with ESPN.

Most of the sellers that CNN spoke to in Lagos didn't seem to understand why it was wrong to sell fake goods.

Oni acknowledged, when pressed, that what she was doing was illegal, however, for her and other sellers, it all boils down to affordability.

Nearly half of Nigeria's 196 million population live in poverty, according to the World Poverty Clock agency.

The minimum wage in Nigeria is around $50 per month and very few have a disposable income to splash on luxuries such as football kits, even in a country as football mad as Nigeria.

85,85,FL-2018-000068-CHN,How Fish Keep These Forests Alive—And How Fishing Threatens Them - National Geographic,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/fish-spread-seeds-flooded-forests-pantanal-south-america-science,"If the forests of South America are the world’s lungs, their rivers and wetlands must be its veins and arteries. This is the most diverse continent when it comes to plant life, and it’s thanks in part to the fish swimming through its waterways.

Freshwater fishes consume about 600 neotropical plant species. The largest of fruit-eating fish in Brazil's Pantanal—a 70,000 square-mile floodplain the size of Washington state with as much as 55 inches of annual rainfall—are disproportionately responsible for dispersing seeds and growing habitat. During bountiful summers, trees adjacent to wetlands often flood, dropping fruit that fish happily swallow, then pass through their excrement. The biggest fish have the biggest stomachs, and the largest potential for dispersal. As much as 95 percent of woody plant species in tropical forests are spread this way.

A recent study in Biotropica shows that when these large fruit-eating fish are eliminated from an ecosystem, anglers “fish down” to capture smaller fish, which can have drastic results on seed dispersal and germination. Essentially, large fish excrete whole seeds while smaller ones poop out seeds destroyed by chewing. Sixty-three percent of seeds counted in the stomachs of sardines, for instance, were demolished by mastication.

“Seventy million years ago there were already forests in the Amazon and the Pantanal,” says the study’s co-author, Sandra Bibiana Correa, an assistant professor at Mississippi State University’s Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Aquaculture. “That means that for 70 million years, those fish have interacted with fruit and helped plants to diversify.”

Correa’s previous work in the Pantanal and Amazon established that overfishing—up to 90 percent for some fruit-eating fish species—hinders plant growth and regeneration.

Critical Roles

Fruit-eating species disperse as much as 95 percent of tropical plants and large fish consume a high diversity of seeds, which enhances germination. When fruit is pulpy, or soaked in water, the chances are that the seed isn’t damaged when eaten. Bigger mouths help, too. “Once they break the seed, the probability of germination drops.”

“Imagine you eat a tomato,” she explains. “It’s highly unlikely you chew the seeds. Seed size determines whether it will be broken down. Big fish are able to swallow whole seeds, but even little fish regularly gobble intact seeds.”

At least 150 species of fruit-eating fish inhabit South American wetlands—even one subspecies of Colombian piranha eat fruit, Correa says. The fruit bloom coincides with the annual flooding, when fish spend as much as 87 percent of their time in the floodplain. When waters recede, those fertilized seeds easily germinate. Long digestive tracts retain seeds for long periods, enabling dispersal across wide distances.

“Over five kilometers,” marvels Raul Costa Pereira, a study co-author and Sao Paulo State University doctoral biologist. Pereira says casting this wide net is a key to this little-known method of spreading forests, a phenomenon that isn’t confined to the Americas.

“Fruit consumption by fish has been documented all over the world,” he adds.

In South America, where wetlands extend over 15 percent of the entire land mass, this fish-forest relationship was first documented in the late 1970s.

One main farmer is the pacu, a ray-finned fish that can live to 60 and grow 40 pounds. With its wide mouth (and human-like teeth), the pacu disperses seeds of 27 percent more plant types than smaller fish. It’s also a delicacy. And when large fish like pacu are overfished, the quantity and diversity of plant life drastically drops.

“The loss of dispersers can have greater consequences than just declines in a few tree species,” confirms Daniel Wenny, a senior biologist at the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory who previously studied seed dispersal.

The biggest consequence is no new forest growth.

Threats to Forests

Flooding here lasts four to seven months a year, with waters rising as high as 30 feet. Fish have historically dispersed up to 90 percent of the flooded forest, a co-dependence Correa worries about. With dams, cattle ranches and development, “they now only disperse 30 to 40 percent of the floodplain.”

Correa and her peers are pushing for regulations for fishing small and large species. That means establishing a body of evidence that shows this interplay. With 99 percent of the Pantanal privately owned by ranches, free-ranging cattle are gobbling up all the natural grass. Correa believes smaller fish here can travel into shallow areas and colonize new territory. But with locals eating these shrimps with impunity, “we really don’t know the population size and structure of the small fish.”

Regulations are hard to enforce in the Amazon, a region bordering eight nations, and in the Pantanal, both places feeling the effects of overfishing. When the fish no longer grow large, the forest doesn’t grow either. And when ranchers expand and dams end cyclical flooding, fish are shut out and trees begin dying with no natural way to regenerate.

“Dozens of species of plants are synchronized with the flood,” Correa says. “We need legislation to protect a very large size of land. It won’t be easy.”","Tue, 12 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.natgeofe.com/n/d8aecbb4-34bb-41dc-b87f-7360106b61a0/00000161-d822-d383-a16f-ddb3b8c50000_16x9.jpg?w=1200,"['copyright', 'large', 'threatens', 'plant', 'forests', 'prohibited', 'fish', 'unauthorized', 'seeds', 'respectful', 'seed', 'species', 'fishing', 'aliveand']",

87,87,FL-2018-000068-CHN,Global warming could be causing tropical storms to ‘slow down and last longer’ - Carbon Brief,https://www.carbonbrief.org/global-warming-could-be-causing-tropical-stroms-slow-down-last-longer,"Rising global temperatures could be causing tropical storms to slow down, allowing them more time to unleash heavy rainfall once making landfall, a new study suggests.

The research, published in Nature, finds the speed at which they travel across the Earth has slowed by an average of 10% over the past 70 years, with the speed of storms originating in the Western North Pacific falling by 30%.

A “notable example” of this effect was seen during Hurricane Harvey, which “stalled” over Houston, releasing 100cm of rain in just three days, the study author tells Carbon Brief.

Although the new study finds a link between temperature rise and storm slowdown, it is possible that natural climate variability has also played a role in the downturn, the author adds.

However, the new analysis does not consider a range of factors affecting the forward speed of tropical storms, including the time of year and local weather conditions, another scientist tells Carbon Brief.

Slowing storms

Climate change can worsen the intensity of tropical storms (such as hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones) in several ways, including by making record rainfall more likely and by causing sea levels to rise, which can raise the risk of storm surges.

The new research looks at how warming could influence the “translation speed” of tropical storms – the speed at which they move across the Earth.

Storms travel as they are carried along global atmospheric circulation patterns – a worldwide system of winds which transport heat from the equator towards the poles.

Climate change is expected to weaken the world’s circulatory winds, which could, in turn, lead to a slowing of the speed at which tropical storms move forwards, says study author Prof James Kossin, an atmospheric scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Center for Weather and Climate. He tells Carbon Brief:

“Tropical cyclones are moving more slowly over the past 70 years or so. The slowing is seen in every ocean basin, except the Northern Indian Ocean. This is having impacts on local rainfall amounts. It could also be impacting coastal storm surge and wind damage.”

As storms slow, they can last for longer over one area, releasing large amounts of intense rainfall. This could pose a threat if storms stall above areas vulnerable to flooding, such as large urban areas, says Kossin. A “notable example” of this effect occurred during Hurricane Harvey, he says in his research paper:

“The unprecedented rainfall totals associated with the ‘stall’ of Hurricane Harvey over Texas in 2017 provide a notable example of the relationship between regional rainfall amounts and tropical-cyclone translation speed.”

Data deluge

For the study, Kossin analysed tropical storm data taken from NOAA’s International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS). “Best-track data” includes information of tropical storm intensity, position and wind structure. The findings suggest that the forward speed of hurricanes fell by an average of 10% between 1949 and 2016.

However, the change in storm-forward speed varied widely from region to region.

The charts below show changes in storm-forward speed in (from top left to bottom right) the North Atlantic, Western North Pacific, Eastern North Pacific, Northern Indian, Southern Hemisphere (less than 100 degrees longitude) and Southern Hemisphere (more than 100 degrees longitude) over the 70-year period. Changes in speed are shown over land (black line) and sea (dotted line).

The charts show how the largest reductions in speed have occured in the Western North Pacific – where the speed of tropical storms fell by 30% – and the North Atlantic, where speeds fell by 20%. In the Australian region, the speed of tropical storms slowed by 19% – although the statistical significance of this result is “marginal”, Kossin says.

However, storms originating in Eastern North Pacific and Northern India do not appear to have slowed over the study period. This could be down to natural climate factors, such as changing ocean currents, Kossin says.

Human fingerprint?

Although the analysis finds a link between falling storm speed and temperature rise, it does not constitute a “single attribution study”, Kossin notes in his research paper.

Attribution studies attempt to work out to what extent climate change could have influenced the likelihood of an extreme weather event, when other factors, such as natural climate variability, are also considered.

However, this analysis does not attempt to tease apart the impacts of human-caused climate change and natural variability, says Kossin:

“The human-caused factors would be things such as anthropogenic global warming, changes in air pollution, land-use change, ozone depletion, but mostly anthropogenic global warming. The natural factors would be just the internal variability of the planet, for example, naturally varying ocean currents.”

Due to this, it is “far from clear that global climate change has anything to do with the changes being identified” in the study, says Prof Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Colorado, who was not involved with the research. He tells Carbon Brief:

“There are some major decadal variations in play. In the Pacific, there is the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.”

The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is a recurring climatic event that affects vast areas of the Pacific Ocean. It has “positive” and “negative” phases, which can each last 20-30 years.

Storms on the horizon

The findings provide a “significant scientific advance” in the world’s understanding of how climate change could influence tropical storms, says Dr Shuai Wang, an atmospheric physicist from Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study. He tells Carbon Brief:

“Tropical cyclones are one of Mother Nature’s most devastating hazards. Based on the findings in this article, it is likely – or very likely – that the motion of tropical cyclones has slowed down.”

However, the analysis has not taken into consideration several factors that may have influenced changes to storm-forward speed over the past 70 years, says Trenberth:

“The month of the storm matters. The translation speed is expected to be different in July, September and November. This should have been taken into account. The track and speed of a storm is heavily dependent on the weather patterns in play: the distribution of anticyclones, and cyclones, cold fronts, jet streams, troughs of low pressure and so forth. There is no evidence that these are changing, on the contrary, the expectation even 50 years from now is that the changes will be imperceptible.”

CHANDIGARH: The increasing number of fragile moraine-dammed glacial lakes in the Himalayas has raised the spectre of flash floods posing a threat to life and property downstream. According to a study conducted by the Himachal Pradesh State Council for Science Technology and Environment’s (HIMCOSTE) state centre for climatic change, there are 1017 such lakes in the region, up from 596 five years ago.

A moraine is the accumulation of silt, sediment and debris from melting glaciers which eventually blocks the flow of the glacier and turns the accumulated water into a lake. But given the fragile nature of the moraine, these lakes could burst their banks with any further pressure, leading to flash floods, technically called glacial lake outburst floods or GLOFs.According to the study, the glaciers in the Chenab, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej river basins in the state are melting at a faster due to climate change, resulting in the formation of more and more such lakes.

According to the study, based on monitoring of all such lakes in different river basins using LISS III satellite data, the Sutlej had a total 642 lakes in 2017 compared to 391 in 2013. Similarly, the Chenab basin has 220 lakes, up from 116 in 2013, the Beas has 101, up from 67, and Ravi river basin has now 54 lakes compared to 22 in 2013.

Adding to the concern is that the new lakes are mostly smaller (with areas less than 5 hectares) ones, which are more susceptible to GLOFs. Lakes with area of 10 hectares or less are seen as particularly vulnerable. The study states that a number of such glacial lake outburst floods have occurred in the Himalayas of Nepal recently, and notes that the 2013 flash floods in Uttarakhand occurred with bursting of the Parchu lake, which originates from Tibet in China.

“A proper monitoring and change analysis of all such lakes in higher Himalayan region of the State is critical for averting any future eventuality in Himachal Pradesh, so that precious human lives are saved,” says Kunal Satyarthi, member secretary of Himachal Pradesh State Council for Science Technology and Environment.","Sat, 09 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2018/6/9/w600X390/Moraine-dam_lakes.jpg,"['himachal', 'lakes', 'pradesh', 'flash', 'study', 'punjab', 'morainedam', 'lake', 'raise', 'fears', 'flood', 'floods', 'glacial', 'river', 'state']",

CHINA — Mont Belvieu police officer Ben Shirley found himself the victim of a crime this morning after realizing his police vest and badge, a Polaris four wheeler, his personal pistol and ammunition and other smaller items were taken from his China home.

Thanks to his doorbell camera, Shirley, his wife and his two young children can sleep soundly knowing the alleged thief, Robert Alderson is now behind bars.

""Just knowing that he's that determined to get into something to take things, to do whatever else he wants to do, that yeah that's very violating,"" Shirley said.

Shirley said his doorbell camera first picked up on Alderson's presense at around 2 a.m.

""Rang the door bell, was acting as if he was hurt or in trouble.Made himself comfortable..Eventually he started ringing the doorbell. He took some boxes that were on the porch then I saw him go to the side of the house,"" Shirley said.

Luckily the camera got a clear shot of Alderson, who lingered around the home for about an hour.

""Being able to identify faces, you got faces, you have a time frame that they were there so you can kind of have an idea of where they show up, we were able to see that he was there for an hour kinda camping out for a little bit so you kind of see how he works and everyone has their way of doing things,"" Shirley said.

With a good idea of Alderson's appearance, investigators were able to narrow down who he could be and where Shirley's things may have been taken. However, had Shirley not had the camera, justice may not have been served so quickly, or even at all.

""You get back to that starting point when you have something and you have no information at all then where can you begin,"" He said.

Jefferson county deputy Marcus McLellan highly encourages everyone to have a surveillance camera of some type in their home.

Most of Shirley's belongings, including his handgun, were retrieved. However, deputies are still on the lookout for his green Polaris and ballistic vest.

If you have any information on the location of these items, they ask that you call Jefferson County Sheriff's Office Dispatch at (409) 835-8411 or Crime Stoppers at (409) 833-8477.

Jim Justice today asked for and received the resignation of Commerce Secretary Woody Thrasher, the administration announced in a news release.

That means the government arm of West Virginia economic development is without its top three officers. Thrasher has now been forced out, Development Office executive director Kris Hopkins left of his own accord, and Josh Jarrell, the deputy secretary for Commerce, was also pushed out.

Announcing Thrasher’s resignation this morning, the governor expressed his appreciation for Thrasher’s service.

Thrasher has been involved with controversy over the state’s handling of millions of dollars in federal long-term flood relief money. But he earlier was at the center of a China investment deal potentially worth billions of dollars.

“I consider Woody a friend, and he’s done a solid job in the area of economic development, Justice stated today. “Thrasher expressed to me that recent media attention had distracted from what he believed was his core mission, economic development and business opportunities for West Virginia.”

“I hope this allows us to turn our attention to the full recovery of all of the victims of the 2016 flood,” Gov. Justice added.

Thrasher stated that he still believes in Justice’s vision for economic development.

“I accepted this appointment because of my love for the state, and because of Governor Justice’s vision that West Virginia and its citizens should not settle for 50th, Thrasher said. “I want the Governor and this state to be successful, and I welcome the opportunity to help any way I can in the future.”

Thrasher, a successful businessman whose engineering firm bears his name, has been the Secretary of Commerce since the Justice administration took office in January, 2017.

When he was first announced for the position, Thrasher said he would only exit private business for Gov. Jim Justice. And Justice, in turn, called Thrasher the “number one guy I wanted to recruit.”

In recent weeks, Thrasher has been in hot water over questions about the Department of Commerce’s handling of federal long-term relief funds.

The agency has been a focal point of controversy over its administration of Community Development Block Grants for disaster relief administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Questions have arisen over a contract for an outside consultant to manage the millions of dollars in grant money, the pace of West Virginia’s long-term flood relief and the effectiveness of communication among agencies and with the public.

During three press conferences last week, Justice was asked about Thrasher’s status.

Last Monday, Justice made some statements that prompted those who watched to question whether Thrasher would keep his job.

“There needs to be realignment within the Commerce Department. There absolutely are shortcomings and pitfalls that have happened within Commerce. Now that we know what we know today,” Justice said.

When a reporter asked about the timetable of a Commerce realignment, Justice answered: “Is this afternoon soon enough?”

The Governor’s Office followed up with a statement alluding to upcoming firings and directing inquiries about Commerce — or at least its role in flood relief — to the National Guard.”

“Gov. Jim Justice said today a realignment at the West Virginia Department of Commerce is now underway, there will be terminations, and therefore until that process is completed all media requests for information are to be directed to Major General James Hoyer.”

By Thursday, at the third press conference of the week, the governor still wasn’t elaborating on what a realignment means for the Department of Commerce or whether its secretary has a job.

“If all we’re trying to accomplish here is to create a food fight or decide ‘Are we going to fire Woody Thrasher or not?’ I mean is that really what we should be doing?” Justice asked.

Thrasher, contacted right after last Monday’s press conference by MetroNews, said he had no plan to leave Commerce.

“Relative to my job, I believe we are accomplishing significant things at Commerce and plan on continuing in that role,” Thrasher stated.

This week, surrounded by reporters at a public event at the Embassy Suites in Charleston, Thrasher held his responses to a directive to call the governor’s communications office.

The only question Thrasher felt at liberty to answer fully was one about economic development in West Virginia.

“I think under Governor Justice’s leadership great strides are being made in attracting industries to West Virginia. I’m sure of that,” Thrasher told reporters this Tuesday.

Justice had great things to say about Thrasher when he named him Secretary of Commerce in late December, 2016.

“For months and months, I always felt that if I were humbled by the people of West Virginia and elected governor, without any question, the number one guy I wanted to recruit was Woody Thrasher,” Justice said in a news release at the time.

“He’s been on my mind for commerce secretary for a while because he understands what it takes to diversify West Virginia’s economy. Woody totally shares my vision that what we need is a better marketing and economic opportunity surrounded by jobs, jobs, jobs for the people of West Virginia.”

Thrasher, in turn, stated that he would only want to leave his private business to help Justice.

The Thrasher Group is an engineering and architectural firm that Thrasher began with his father in 1983. It has nearly 400 employees.

“I wouldn’t have done this for anyone other than Governor-elect Jim Justice,” Thrasher stated back then.

“Mr. Justice’s passion for our people inspired me to step away from my businesses and serve the people of West Virginia the best way possible. I look forward to working with the Justice Administration to create new jobs and opportunities. Just like the Governor-elect, my top priority is to turn around West Virginia. We need to think big, and I am excited to work with Governor-elect Justice make his big economic development ideas a reality.”

Thrasher and Justice both advocated for millions more in funding to help the Department of Commerce do its business recruitment work, but each of the past two years the Legislature hasn’t been able to come up with the money.

Thrasher rode a wave of excitement — and also mystery — last November with the announcement of a deal for China Energy to invest $83 billion in projects related to West Virginia natural gas.

Thrasher and the Justice administration still have not fully described the scope of the projects and the related memorandum of understanding has not been released.

Thrasher signed the memorandum of understanding in China in front of President Donald Trump.

During a press conference to describe the China deal, Justice talked about how proud he was of many of his cabinet picks.

“And we’ve got other superstars, and right there’s one of them, Woody Thrasher,” he said that day. “And what a job he’s done. What an incredible job the Commerce department is doing.”","Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PB1_0572-1-1-490x327.jpg,"['development', 'west', 'department', 'economic', 'commerce', 'virginia', 'secretary', 'woody', 'thrasher', 'justices', 'request', 'governor', 'justice', 'resigns']",

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

DENVER — A family said they are fed up after their home was flooded a second time in three years because of a water main break.

In 2015, a water main broke and sent water running downhill and into Dugg Duggan’s home. Denver Water paid $85,000 in repairs to the home and issued the Duggan’s an $8,000 check to replace personal items. Duggan said that check for personal items covered little of the estimated $45,000 of personal items that were damaged. Still, he said he was grateful in 2015 for some assistance.

“The first time is happened, we looked at it as bad luck for them, bad luck for us,” said Duggan.

Over the weekend, a water main broke again and flooded the Duggan’s home a second time.

“[We are feeling] a lot more distraught than the first time oddly enough. We know how long it’s going to be and how painful it’s going to be,” said Duggan.

Duggan said he wants answers as to how this water main broke yet again and he wants to see Denver Water assist more in clean up and replacement.

“I just want them to take responsibility this time,” said Duggan.

Denver Water spokesperson Stacy Chesney said the water main did not break in the same exact location it did in 2015. She said it was in the same general area along the pipe and with where the Duggan’s house is situated, it funneled back into their home again.

Chesney said under Colorado’s law for government immunity, Denver Water does not have to pay for these repairs. The law was established to make sure costly legal battles were not passed on to rate payers. However, Chesney said Denver Water chooses to pay for repairs and give people $8,000 for personal property because it’s the right thing to do.

“We absolutely feel for this family. It has got to be really challenging and hard for them right now and that’s why we responded to the scene immediately to help with clean up and restoration and why we are open with working with them so we can do the right thing and get them restored to where they need to be,” said Chesney.

Duggan said damage to their home is worse the second time and everything that could be salvaged last time will now need to be ripped up and replaced.

Denver Water hired and is paying for the restoration company that is currently working on the Duggan’s home.","Tue, 12 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://kdvr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/promo353115198.jpg?w=1280,"['break', 'duggans', 'right', 'repairs', 'broke', 'main', 'frustrated', 'twice', 'floods', 'water', 'family', 'second', 'items', 'denver', 'personal']", 
95,95,FL-2018-000068-CHN,Designing our own solutions in Marin City - San Francisco Chronicle,https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/Designing-our-own-solutions-in-Marin-City-12977654.php,"Just as water is the foundation of life, so must it be the foundation of design and the built environment.

This is one of the lessons we learned through developing the People’s Plan for Marin City, a grassroots effort that has allowed us to develop a greater understanding of Marin City’s natural features, and of the threats ahead to our homes and way of life from a rising bay.

Marin City is a unique place within the more affluent Marin County. With many lower-income residents and a large number of people of color, our unincorporated community is worlds apart from our neighboring cities.

We have experienced chronic flooding for more than 75 years. Storm runoff regularly inundates the only way in and out of town, Donahue Street, as well as on our only connection to the rest of the county, Highway 101. With San Francisco Bay waters rising, things could get a whole lot worse for our residents, who have experienced generations of marginalization, isolation and exclusion, but who nonetheless stand proud and are eager to take charge of their future.

So when a team of designers, landscape architects and educators proposed a process to address the challenges of rising seas, Marin City residents welcomed them. An intergenerational group of Marin City residents came together to learn and brainstorm. Together we produced the People’s Plan that we hope to start implementing this summer.

We had heard many times that Marin City is shaped like a bowl, but we never understood the significance of that until now. Rainwater flows from the ridge into the bowl, then down into the town area where the churches, schools, shopping center, homes, apartments and the only entrance into and exit from Marin City lie, causing these areas to flood. When this happens, people cannot get to work or school, or get critical health and other needs met. Emergency responders may be trapped outside the community when needed the most.

A few times, flooding has been so bad that southbound Highway 101 has been blocked, turning the freeway into a parking lot throughout most of Marin and Sonoma counties.

During an eight-week class that included workshops, guest speakers and field trips, the design team showed us how we can spread the water, sink the water and store the water. We mapped out areas that we know have flooding problems, then came up with solutions. We already are designing an intergenerational community garden. We are extremely excited about using terrace gardening, which would help prevent erosion along hillsides while providing vegetation, preserving open space, and allowing access for disabled residents at lower levels.

Our group desires to continue to learn and develop solutions for Marin City’s flooding issues — to do whatever work we can by and for ourselves. The biggest risk now is that we don’t want to fall into the pattern of getting people’s hopes up and then not being able to complete the projects. Marin City has a history of being placed on the back burner, which demoralizes our community members and makes them reluctant to step forward and trust the good intentions of outsiders.

We call on the leaders and residents of Marin County and beyond to join with us in continuing this investment in our communities. Learn from us, and invest in us.

Fire crews were called to Ballater after it was affected by flooding due to heavy rain.

Two appliances were sent by the fire service to the town around 12.30pm on Saturday after reports of a large amount of surface water on the streets.

David Cobban, co-owner of the Brakeley Gift Room on Bridge Street, was on holiday when the shop flooded, with his mother and father-in-law running the store.

“They were unable to leave the shop, which is at the lowest point on Bridge Street, due to the water, and only got out when the fire crews arrived.

He said: “It all just happened so quickly that no one could do anything.

“The water came up so high they couldn’t open the door to put the flood barriers up.

“They were stuck in the shop for a while until the fire brigade let them out.”

David said his parents-in-law got help to save as much stuff from the front of the store as they could.

He added: “The water came about a third of the way into the shop through the door.

“Cars were going down the road and the water was going in waves over the pavement into the shop. They did shut the road eventually.

“If it hadn’t been for the cars it wouldn’t have been as bad. This time we have been lucky, we didn’t lose nearly as much stock as before.

“The fire brigade have been great.”

A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokeswoman said: “A couple of streets had surface water, so we were liaising with the council.”

The appliances, sent from Aboyne and Ballater, were used to pump some water out of the streets – with it reaching as high as 3ft (0.9m) on Bridge Street.

Roads also included Bridge Street, Bridge Square, Invercauld Road and Station Square.

The town was previously hit by severe flooding following Storm Frank at the end of 2015.

Hundreds of residents had to flee their homes and dozens of businesses were wrecked when the River Dee burst its banks and engulfed the community.

Parts of the village were left devastated after 3-4ft (0.9-1.2m) of water flooded through streets, destroying homes and businesses.

Councillor Geva Blackett, who represents the area, said: “I feel so sorry for Ballater folk – hit again.”

She went on to say that she would be going along to the scene to see what can be done, and to report back to council officers.

She said: “It wasn’t nearly as bad as last time.

“We had the duck festival yesterday afternoon and hundreds of people came.

“Ballater is alive and well and kicking.”

Met Office weather expert Marco Petagna said: “During warnings, 20-30mm (0.7-1in) of rain fell in an hour and 40-70mm (1.5-2.8in) in two or three hours. Some areas had 50mm rainfall in quite a short time. Average rainfall for June is 76mm or three inches, so some parts saw two-thirds of the average month’s rain within one hour.”

With the onset of monsoon, people residing near the rivers and streams in Saptari are living in constant terror of floods.

Jitan Devi Sada of Raghunathpur in Kanchanrup Municipality-9, Saptari, recalled how she had survived last year’s flood. “Monsoon has started, I am worried how I am going to save my kids if there is a flood this year?” Sada said.

The plight of Sada’s neighbour Shantidevi Sada is not different. Shantidevi said that swollen Sundarikhola nearby her house had swept away five houses last year. “The flood swept away and turned one and a half bigaha of the land she had been tilling barren last year,” she said. Shantidevi shared that she was able to survive the flood as she had run away with her kids. “Had we not fled, we would have died. I do not know what will happen this monsoon,” said a worried Shantidevi.

Sundarikhola had wreaked havoc after the stream changed its course and gushed into Raghunathpur by breaking the embankment.

According to local Ghuran Sada, the flood in Sundarikhola had washed away homes of Dev Narayan Yadav, Abadhi Yadav, Raj Kumar Yadav, Nawal Yadav, Ramkrishna Yadav. “Despite frequent visits by district level leaders and government officials, no one has shown concern about constructing embankment,”complained Ghuran Sada.

Ghuransaid their hopes of being saved by the government from floods had been dashed. Floods had destroyed around 500 bigaha of arable land at Raghunathpur, Theliya, Bhediya, Gorpar, Wadahara, Subbatole, Trikaul and Giraha, among other places, last year.

Chief Bishnu Bahadur Bhandari at the District Soil Conservation Office, Saptari, said that inundation problem had increased as the

water level in the river had gone up.

“The earthquakes of 2015 and Chure erosion have led to the problem in the rivers,” Bhandari said.

Bhandari said lack of planned work for people’s safety and Chure protection increased the risks of inundation despite millions of investment for river control in the district.","Sun, 10 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://thehimalayantimes.com/uploads/imported_images/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Flood-victims-2.jpg,"['district', 'living', 'yadav', 'worried', 'raghunathpur', 'saptari', 'monsoon', 'flood', 'floods', 'fear', 'sada', 'locals', 'away', 'shantidevi']", 
99,99,FL-2018-000068-CHN,San Mateo County: Flood Park redesign worries nearby residents - The Mercury News,https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/06/14/san-mateo-county-flood-park-redesign-worries-nearby-residents/,"Once they’re done, the new sports fields being developed at Flood Park in Menlo Park should be off-limits between 4 and 6 p.m. weekdays, according to neighbors who have signed petitions seeking such a restriction.

San Mateo County has been working to revamp the park, which is tucked along Bay Road, to help address a shortage of county fields for recreational activities. The park’s baseball field hasn’t been used since 2011 because of the poor condition of the field after work was done by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission to a pipeline that runs underneath it.

The baseball field is to be reconstructed and a new soccer/lacrosse field added. That would make Flood the first county park with a multi-use field, according to county parks spokeswoman Carla Schoof.

Nettie Wijsman, who lives adjacent to the park on Del Norte Avenue, sent a petition signed by 54 neighbors asking the county to prohibit field use between 4 and 6 p.m. weekdays. The petition also asks that all sports activities be at least 100 feet from neighbors’ property lines.

Wijsman said traffic along Bay Road is already gridlocked during those hours between Willow and Marsh roads, particularly at the nearby Ringwood Avenue intersection. Bay Road is the only way into the park.

“While the players and spectators will come and then return to their homes, we will experience the noise, parking, and traffic problems every weekday afternoon and every Saturday and Sunday all year long and likely daily during the summer,” Wijsman wrote in a letter accompanying the petition.

But Schoof said the county intends to ease that traffic by giving out annual passes to sports leagues so they don’t have to queue at the front gate to pay fees, and possibly add kiosks where other visitors will pay after they park. She said the county already is aiming to keep fields at least 100 feet from residences but acknowledged that won’t be determined until detailed designs are prepared.

Wijsman said she launched the petition drive because she and many of her neighbors feel their voices haven’t been heard over the past three years since the redevelopment began. She said it seems that the concerns of sports teams are being placed above those of residents.

“I feel like there has been no respect for us neighbors in this park plan,” she said Wednesday.

Wijsman added that there has been no analysis of anticipated traffic impacts from games, but the environmental report says that 125 parking spaces should be sufficient. On a recent Sunday evening, she said 123 spaces were occupied by visitors picnicking, walking the park or taking their children to the playground.

“Is the plan going to squeeze out many of the current users who are mostly from East Palo Alto, East Menlo Park and North Fair Oaks where they have many family, church, and community celebrations and limited spaces to host these?” she wrote.

The county Parks and Recreation Commission is set to review the park’s final environmental assessment report Aug. 2 before it goes to the Board of Supervisors for final approval at a later date.

If the assessment is approved, the county will next begin the park design phase and hold community meetings along the way, Schoof said.","Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DNG-L-SMCFLOOD-0613-1.jpg?w=1024&h=768,"['traffic', 'residents', 'mateo', 'road', 'redesign', 'field', 'petition', 'worries', 'nearby', 'san', 'county', 'spaces', 'flood', 'fields', 'parks', 'neighbors', 'park']",
