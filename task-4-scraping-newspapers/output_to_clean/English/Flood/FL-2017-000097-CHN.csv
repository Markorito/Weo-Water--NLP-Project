With mandis in Madhya Pradesh refusing to deal in the pricey spice after changes in the drugs Act, sackloads of it from China and Pakistan are flooding the markets here.Traders fear that they may be booked under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act now that the Centre has amended the law and the MP government has implemented it. But that hasn’t diminished the demand for it for recipes like aloo-posta, khuskhus halwa and thandai.So, posta from China and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border via Turkey has replaced the produce from Malwa and Rajasthan, say opium farmers in Neemuch, where the trade was once worth Rs 200 crore. The Neemuch mandi was the biggest posta trade centre; now it won’t touch the spice. The same goes for the neighbouring Ratlam mandi.Umrao Gurjar, a farmers’ leader in Neemuch, said, “The posta you get from Turkey is actually grown on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. All the poppy seed available in market now belongs to the hostile countries at the cost of Indian farmers.”Jaynarayan Singh, convener of Swadeshi Jagran Manch in MP and Chhattisgarh wants the Centre to “review” the poppy seed rules, ensuring at the same time that no “irregularity” takes place.More than 30,000 pattas are given to farmers to grow opium in the Malwa region of MP under surveillance of narcotics department. Poppy season starts in February and after extraction of opium, khuskhus is extracted in April-May and farmers start bringing the seeds to market in June -July, said Ramchandra Patidar , an opium farmer in Ratlam.The problem started when the government banned sale and purchase of poppy husk. “This was done in 2016 after the Centre amended the NDPS Act. Now a farmer can filter posta in his field and destroy the husk. No husk is allowed outside the field,” said excise commissioner Arun Kochar told TOI.Farmer Radheshyam Dhangar said, “We do filter it in the fields but some waste material or residue of husk still remains in the posta we take to the market. This scares traders, who fear prosecution and shun the entire lot.”President of Opium Producers and Farmers Organisation Kaloo Singh Borana said, “There is just 0.02 % morphine content in waste material. It otherwise doesn’t come under NDPS Act.”","Tue, 25 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-59747917,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1736261,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","['market', 'pakistan', 'china', 'posta', 'seed', 'poppy', 'flood', 'ndps', 'centre', 'neemuch', 'mp', 'seeds', 'act', 'husk', 'farmers', 'opium']",

Ferg Horne, a 64-year-old farmer who lives on New Zealand’s South Island, captured the July 22 event on his phone, according to the Associated Press.

While making his way through rain to rescue his neighbor’s 40 sheep, Horne told the AP he saw the sheep huddled together on the farm, standing in about three inches of water. (Watch ""Mother Rabbit Viciously Attacks Snake—Find Out Why"")

What caught his eye, however, were several dark figures in the herd. Upon closer inspection, he realized it was three wild rabbits—two on one sheep and a third on another sheep—hitching a ride toward safer ground.

In an effort to save both the sheep and the rabbits, Horne steered the herd to a dry patch of land. Despite the rugged ride, the rabbits were able to cling to the wool. (Watch ""Dramatic Rescues Show Intensity of China’s Deadly Floods"")

“As they jumped through the water, the rabbits had a jolly good try at staying on,” Horne told the AP.

Once the sheep reached dry land, the rabbits fell off before climbing a hedge to safety. When Horne returned later that afternoon, he said the sheep were all safe, and the rabbits had moved on.

Just the week before WhatsApp was hit by disruptions, Apple said that to ensure it complied with the law it would begin storing data from its iCloud service in China. It also said it would work with a local Chinese company to set up a data center in southwest China as part of a $1 billion investment.

An Apple spokeswoman referred to remarks by Apple’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, during the company’s most recent earnings call, in which he said Apple was “very enthusiastic” about opportunities in China.

Yet keeping Beijing satisfied is only part of the challenge for Apple. With more and more Chinese smartphone makers selling high-quality smartphones cheaply, the company’s sales in the country have slid over the past two years. In the second quarter ending April 1, the company’s revenue in greater China fell 14 percent, even as the market remains critical. Greater China accounts for 21 percent of the company’s sales, making it Apple’s most important market after the United States.

In a new tack for Apple in China, just last week it created a new position, general manager for greater China, and appointed a longtime manager, Isabel Ge Mahe, to the position. Ms. Ge Mahe was born in China, speaks Mandarin and has deep engineering experience. The company is also in search of a greater China policy head after its former head, Jun Ge, recently resigned, according to two people familiar with the matter.

If Apple is trying something new, LinkedIn is showing that what had been an accepted model within China is no guarantee of success. Unlike Apple, which as a hardware company is considered less threatening by the Chinese government, LinkedIn had to go along with a bargain other internet companies have refused.

In 2014 the company agreed to start censoring — much as Google had done almost a decade before it eventually left China — and formed a partnership with two influential Chinese venture capital investment funds to create a separate China operation. While the self-censorship drew complaints from users, other technology companies looking to get into China came to see LinkedIn’s approach as a model.

By bringing in well-connected investors, it was able to ensure its communications with the Chinese government were in capable hands. It also focused on the particulars of the local market. It hired Derek Shen, a successful Chinese entrepreneur and Google veteran, to run its China operations separately. Mr. Shen, in turn, created a stand-alone app to bring LinkedIn, a service built around email and computers, to China’s smartphone-dependent population.","Sat, 22 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/23/business/23ChinaTechJP/23ChinaTechJP-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=a5d721e7688413c485979741e28adbfd2287213c7d5efc74e3a7e615e6b7bdd8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"['market', 'china', 'giants', 'silicon', 'apple', 'company', 'position', 'ge', 'greater', 'confront', 'companys', 'walls', 'valley', 'linkedin', 'chinese']",

The proposed six-lane highway will cost about 400 billion rupees ($620 million), making it among the most expensive infrastructure projects in the state.

""The Brahmaputra Highway will serve the twin purpose of taming the annual floods and drastically improving connectivity in the region,"" said Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal.

""This is a long-term effort to tame the Brahmaputra as it will be a road-cum-embankment aimed at checking the perennial floods in Assam,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The state has done a preliminary survey and will submit a report to the transport ministry shortly, he said.

Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said in New Delhi Wednesday that the project would be fast-tracked.

The 2,900-km Brahmaputra is one of Asia's largest rivers. It runs through Tibet, India and Bangladesh before draining into the Bay of Bengal.

An overflowing Brahmaputra River inundates hundreds of villages and displaces tens of thousands of people every year, while also damaging property and killing livestock and wildlife.

Last year more than 20 rare one-horned rhinos drowned in a national park.

More than 70 people have been killed so far this year, as the state bears the brunt of heavy monsoon rains.

India has the world's highest exposure of gross domestic product to river flooding, with more than $14 billion exposed every year, according to the World Resources Institute.

That could increase more than 10-fold to $154 billion by 2030, WRI estimates.

Embankments are widely used in Assam and elsewhere in the country as a way to contain river flooding.

But breaches are common, causing widespread damage.

""We are yet to build an embankment that does not breach. They are a flawed way to manage floods, as they interfere with the natural flow of rivers,"" said Dinesh Mishra of Barh Mukti Abhiyaan, a campaign that works with communities in flood-prone areas to manage flooding.

""They restrain the river and therefore increase its intensity, so a breach is inevitable and causes even more devastation, as we have seen any number of times,"" he said.

The annual flooding of the river is a natural feature that is essential for cultivation when the waters recede. Embankments also interfere with this process, he said.

Mishra and other activists also oppose a planned $50 billion project to interlink rivers to divert water from surplus areas to those that suffer from drought. The environmental impact of the project would be huge, they say.","Thu, 27 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/7CD3B923-923F-4230-99CA-870599608CC5.jpg,"['northeast', 'billion', 'assam', 'build', 'guwahati', '800mile', 'plans', 'floods', 'india', 'steer', 'river', 'work', 'embankment', 'curb', 'brahmaputra', 'highway']",

Villagers affected by the U.S. $781 million Lower Sesan 2 hydropower dam project on Mekong River tributaries in northeastern Cambodia’s Stung Treng province said on Monday that they will remain in their villages as the water level keeps rising during a test of the 400-megawatt project.

Officials previously warned locals that the area would be flooded when testing began on July 15, but scores of residents of Sesan district’s Sre Kor and Kbal Romeas communes refused to move out and abandon land they have occupied for generations.

On the tenth day of the test on Monday, eight of 10 sluices were closed during the initial round of testing, pushing up the water level in the Sesan River to 66 meters (217 feet) at the dam site, they said.

The water level will reach a height of 67 meters (220 feet) at Sre Kor commune. In the meantime, the Sre Pork Bridge and a few roads in Kbal Rormeas, where the dam is located, are now flooded, villagers said.

Um Reth, a representative from Cambodia’s Royal Group, which is part of the joint venture with China’s Hydrolancang International Energy that has built the dam, told RFA’s Khmer Service that Sre Kor and Kbal Rormeas will be flooded when the other two sluices are closed.

He also said that weather conditions are contributing to the elevated water level.

“There are rain storms in the area,” he said. “The water level may be higher than anticipated. The Sre Pork Bridge shouldn’t be inundated, but now it has already been flooded.”

Futh Khoeun, a resident of Old Sre Kor village told RFA that those who have refused to leave the area remain in their homes there, although authorities have imposed some restrictions on people’s movements in Sre Kor and Kbal Rormeas.

Authorities also have prevented some visitors from entering the area.

About 124 families in Sre Kor commune and 58 families in Kbal Rormeas commune have refused compensation plans offered by the government and the joint venture.

They say they do not want to move to a new location because it would be much more difficult for them to eke out a living and because they do not want to abandon their ancestors’ tombs and the place they have called home for generations.

Hundreds of others have already accepted compensation offered to them and left the area near the dam’s reservoir to resettle in new homes.

On July 5, the joint venture that built the dam said it would start testing the facilities from mid-July to mid-August, during which the water level of the river is projected to rise to 72 meters (236 feet).

Once it becomes operational in September, the Lower Sesan 2 will be the largest hydropower dam in Cambodia.

The North Korean-Chinese border stretches 880 miles (1,415 kilometers) across China's Liaoning province, an industrial and mining heartland prone to heavy smog and painfully cold winters.

In more hospitable months, the border city of Dandong plays host to hundreds of tourists coming to gawp at North Korea -- from boats on the Yalu River which separates the two countries, or through binoculars on a section of the Great Wall overlooking the international boundary.

Below the tourists, trucks carrying Chinese goods rumble into North Korea as a small number of shoppers and traders head in the opposite direction.

But recent reports published on Chinese military and government websites, first highlighted by the Wall Street Journal , show Beijing is moving to reinforce the border as tensions on the Korean Peninsula rise and some in the US call for regime change in Pyongyang.

High security

According to a report published last month on the official website of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), a ""newly formed border defense brigade"" is conducting patrols to gather intelligence, assess the situation and more accurately map out the border region -- which includes North Korea, Russia and Mongolia.

Another report said the ""whole area"" has newly been placed under ""24-hour video surveillance"" including drones, patrol cars and high-tech cameras.

The North Korea border region is a highly strategic one for China, and has seen conflict during World War II and the Korean War, but one of Beijing's chief concerns is not military forces pouring across the border, but refugees.

""A mass movement of North Korean civilians across the border into China is a major concern, particularly given the dense population centers not far from the border, and the economic importance of Northeast China,"" according to a recent report by the US-based Jamestown Foundation.

While North Korea has proved remarkably capable of shrugging off economic sanctions, the country has suffered major famines and widespread food insecurity in the past, analysts say a conflict on the peninsula would likely result in hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of civilians heading north into China, the specter of which is a ""huge worry for Beijing"" according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

Just as the Syrian refugee crisis has strained the resources of neighboring countries and caused widespread political strife in Europe, many in China are concerned by the hit the country's economy and security could take from even a small conflict on the Korean Peninsula.

""The stakes are huge,"" retired US Adm. Mike Mullen said last year . ""Instability generated on the peninsula could cascade into China, making China's challenge of providing for its own people that much more difficult.""

In March, retired PLA Major General Wang Haiyun said it was ""necessary to prepare military action as soon as possible for a potential war"" on the peninsula.

""Once war breaks out, we should also consider setting up an international refugee camp in North Korean territory to prevent the influx of North Korean refugees,"" said Wang in an op-ed in the state-owned Global Times.

The group has urged a house-buyout program for flood-weary residents, rather than bailing them out time and again.In Florida, more than 1,600 properties have flooded an average of five times since 1978, according to the council’s review of data from FEMA. Flood potential remains a risk as Central Florida’s lakes continue to rise with daily afternoon-storm deluges — even with more than three months left in hurricane season.The nation’s flood-insurance piggy bank is set to expire in late September — potentially hitting a state with about a third of the country’s 5 million policies. If it ends, no new policies would be written and hme sales requiring flood insurance could suffer.Facing $24 billion of debt, the program faces calls for an end or overhaul.Lake County resident Dolores Blood owns a Debary-area rental duplex that flooded with several feet of water in 2008 when parts of Volusia County were inundated with unusually high rainfalls. The insurance works for property where flooding isn’t expected but it should not cover places known for being under water repeatedly, she said.“If you live on the beach, then you pay a premium,” said Blood, who saw her flood insurance rates double last year almost a decade after getting $82,000 for each of two duplex buildings that flooded.The National Resources Defense Council this week proposed a plan allowing repeated flood victims to sign up for a buyout program prior to the next flood. If high waters then damage their property, FEMA would fund local governments to purchase the flood-prone home or business and demolish them to provide more open space.“The National Flood Insurance Program was designed to help Americans recover from flood disasters, but it can also unintentionally ‘trap’ homeowners who would prefer to move somewhere safer,” stated a spokesman for the council. ”Instead of moving, many policyholders find themselves rebuilding their homes again and again.”Other plans call for shifting the insurance program to the private sector. In addition, Sen. Bill Nelson co-sponsored bi-partisan legislation to extend the program six months and cap premium increases at 10 percent — down from 25 percent currently.———©2017 The Orlando Sentinel (Orlando, Fla.)Visit The Orlando Sentinel (Orlando, Fla.) at www.OrlandoSentinel.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.","Tue, 25 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://erepublic.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/42f39f5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/940x457+0+87/resize/1440x700!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ferepublic-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fac%2F91%2Fa17d721c564c320055a729244ec2%2Fflorida-15.jpg,"['florida', 'program', 'orlando', 'state', 'insurance', 'water', 'flood', 'national', 'loom', 'sentinel', 'repeated', 'council', 'reforms']",

FUZHOU, July 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,100 people have been evacuated as eastern China's Fujian Province braces for the impact of Typhoon Nesat.

Fujian meteorological station said Nesat was expected to make landfall in Taiwan Saturday and might land in the form of a typhoon or strong tropical storm in Fujian early Sunday.

By Saturday noon, over 3,100 women, children and elderly had taken to the shore from fish farms, the provincial flood control headquarters said.

On Saturday, Nesat, the ninth typhoon this year, was traveling at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour in a northwest direction, packing gusts of wind up to 144 kilometers an hour.

The station said the 10th typhoon had been also formed and was expected to land late Sunday or early next Monday in central to northern Fujian.

The authority warned of torrential rain from Saturday through to next Wednesday due to the impact of dual typhoons. Rain is forecast to be over 500 millimeters in some areas.

China's State Oceanic Administration Friday issued this year's first orange alert for ocean waves off the east coast ahead of Typhoon Nesat.

The administration ordered vessels in affected waters to return to port, personnel to evacuate and related departments to close beach entertainment facilities.

BUDAPEST, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Hungary issued state bonds in China in an amount of 1 billion yuan (151 million U.S. dollars), State Secretary of the Ministry for National Economy Agnes Hornung said Wednesday.

It is the first time that Hungary entered the Chinese interbank bond market to issue RMB bonds and Hungary's first sovereign panda bonds.

""The bond issued on the onshore market in China has a 3-year maturity, and its interest rate is 4.85 percent,"" Hornung told journalists. Later the bond will be swapped to euro, thus, the interest rate on the bonds launched in China will have a more favorable rate, she added.

Hornung underlined that the emission was symbolic and contributed to the strengthening of Chinese-Hungarian economic relations.

""The current issue is part of a 3 billion RMB program, and ulterior releases will be made subject to market conditions,"" she said.

Besides decreasing the level of public debt, the aim of the Hungarian government is to decrease the debt held in foreign currencies, Hornung said. She also praised the achievements of the government, which saw the debt to GDP ratio fall from 80.7 percent in 2011 to 74 percent in 2016.

The bond issued on the Chinese market was the result of an agreement reached in November 2015 between Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and the Bank of China to issue a bond in RMB, Hornung recalled.

""The so-called dim sum bond issued last spring was issued under English law, while the current bond was issued under Chinese law and its preparation started in 2016,"" she added.

The interest rate of 4.85 percent of the bond is lower than the one billion RMB government bond issued in April last year, which was 6.25 percent.","Wed, 26 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['xinhua', 'china', 'hungary', 'billion', 'issued', 'rate', 'market', 'issue', 'debt', 'rmb', 'hornung', 'issues', 'panda', 'bonds', 'interest', 'bond']",

Without them, some 12 million people – out of the country’s 17 million – could be flooded.

With climate change, the risk of extreme weather increases. If a superstorm hit the Netherlands and the dikes burst, 3 to 5 metres of water would engulf the land. A catastrophic scenario.

About 60 percent of the Dutch live in areas below sea level. Flood damage could cost the Netherlands more than 100 billion euros, and parts of the country would no longer be inhabitable.

Richard Jorissen, Managing Director of the Dutch Flood Protection Programme, explains how climate change can cause water to become an ever bigger part of the picture in the Netherlands.

“Climate change may cause increased river discharge, but it may also cause sea levels and lake levels to rise, so the water level downstream may go up as well,” he said.

While his team errs on the side of caution and prepares for an even higher risk of flooding than current projections suggest, sea levels are rising at an increasingly steep rate, which makes them tough to predict, Jorissen said.

The Netherlands fights floods by beefing up dunes and beaches, making rivers wider, and using a network of 17,600 kilometres of dikes.

These investments have made the Dutch masters of flood safety. Now, the country is “pitching this expertise” abroad:http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/15/world/europe/netherlands-sets-model-of-flood-prevention.html and it has turned flood prevention into a 7-billion-euro export product.

27,27,FL-2017-000097-CHN,Hong Kong-China train station could apply mainland law - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-40712984,"Hong Kong-China train station could apply mainland law By Juliana Liu

Hong Kong correspondent, BBC News Published 26 July 2017

image copyright Reuters image caption The project is part of major plans to better link Hong Kong with the mainland rail network

Hong Kong's government has unveiled a controversial plan which would allow Chinese mainland law to apply in the territory for the first time.

It's part of attempts to streamline operations at the new Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link, which will open next year, costing just under HK$84.42bn ($10.8bn; £8.3bn).

Under the new plan, passengers will be able to undertake border clearance procedures for both Hong Kong and China successively in one building in West Kowloon, Hong Kong.

And it will be mainland law which will be in force in parts of the terminal, even though it's on Hong Kong soil.

The government says that will be more convenient for passengers, but opponents say it could violate Hong Kong law.

How do people normally move from Hong Kong to the mainland?

For those travelling overland, the process is similar to most border crossings between countries.

At the busiest land crossings, passengers must first clear immigration and customs in one physical jurisdiction, then walk or be driven a fair distance to clear immigration in the other jurisdiction.

Hong Kong immigration procedures are handled on undisputed Hong Kong territory, and Chinese immigration procedures are handled in Shenzhen, which is the mainland.

So what will be different about this one?

Hong Kong officials are touting this as a ""one-stop"" clearance.

image copyright Reuters image caption The station at West Kowloon is still being built

Passengers will be able to complete both Hong Kong and Chinese clearance procedures under one roof inside the West Kowloon terminus building, before boarding trains to all cities on the national high-speed railway network.

Hong Kong officials say this will be like similar arrangements between for example the US and Canada, and the UK and France on the Eurostar.

How will the process work?

China will lease the so-called ""Mainland Port Area"" from Hong Kong. The area will comprise the Chinese section of immigration and customs and the waiting hall for departure passengers, as well as all platforms and trains.

Full Chinese law, both criminal and civil, will prevail in this entire area, even though it is physically located on Hong Kong soil.

Hong Kong officials say the area will be considered to be outside the territorial boundary of Hong Kong.

There will be immigration, customs, quarantine, administration and police officers stationed in the area.

So why are people worried?

Hong Kong has a separate legal system from mainland China, under the One Country Two Systems framework.

image copyright EPA image caption People in favour of greater or total independence for Hong Kong accuse Beijing of meddling in its politics

Under this Basic Law, Hong Kongers have a far greater degree of freedom to protest than mainland citizens have, among other differences.

Mainland officials also have no jurisdiction in the territory.

Critics say the proposal could lead to Hong Kongers being arrested on Hong Kong soil for actions which are legal here, but not in mainland China.

It also feeds in to growing concern in recent years about Chinese encroachment into Hong Kong affairs, after the disappearance from Hong Kong of several people who sold books critical of the Chinese government, and the removal of several MPs who had protested against Beijing while being sworn in.

It is currently unclear whether Western social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, which are blocked in mainland China, will be accessible within the port area.

The Hong Kong government proposal must be approved by Chinese authorities, before it can be implemented in Hong Kong through a change or addition in local legislation.

Pro-democracy legislators say they will try to veto the plan.","Wed, 26 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C29A/production/_97081894_mediaitem97080656.jpg,"['station', 'train', 'kongchina', 'passengers', 'officials', 'law', 'hong', 'immigration', 'mainland', 'procedures', 'say', 'apply', 'kong', 'chinese']",

BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The result of an investigation into a scandal in which a foreign medical journal retracted 107 papers from China for peer review fraud was announced by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MST) on Thursday.

The medical journal ""Tumor Biology,"" published by Springer Nature, retracted the papers in April, after an investigation found the peer review process had been compromised by using fabricated email addresses of reviewers.

Of the 521 authors implicated, 11 were deemed innocent with 24 still under investigation. Among the remaining authors, 486 authors were found guilty of misconduct at various levels. A total of 102 were found to be mainly responsible, 70 secondarily responsible and 314 did not participate in fraud, said He Defang, a ministry official in charge of rule enforcement.

The 314 authors, who were found not guilty of fraud or from benefiting from any scientific and technological programs or awards, were blamed for neglecting the management of academic achievements and paper publications.

In the 107 papers published, two were repeat publications by the journal. One was retracted by mistake and its authors were innocent. A total of 101 papers fabricated peer reviews or reviewers, in which 95 were reviewed by fabricated experts or had fake reviews provided by third-party institutions. Six had peer reviews or reviewers fabricated by the authors, according to He.

Twelve of the 101 papers were purchased from third-party institutions, with the remaining 89 papers completed by the authors themselves. Nine were fake in content.

He said that the academic fraud had severely damaged China's national image, and called for a healthier academic environment and harsher punishment for academic misdeeds.

After the scandal, a joint work group was formed by the MST, Ministry of Education, National Health and Family Planning Commission, National Natural Science Foundation, and China Association for Science and Technology (CAST) to investigate the issue.

The work group maintained ""zero tolerance"" toward academic dishonesty and severely punished authors who had cheated, He said.

Altogether 376 authors involved in the scandal have been banned by their institutions from undertaking research programs for various periods of time. They also have their qualifications for promotion canceled, research funds retrieved, and awards and honors revoked.

In addition, they will face punishment according to the Communist Party of China discipline regulations and the regulations on personnel from public institutions, He said.

The MST has suspended the approval processes of 20 national scientific and technological projects that involve 21 authors implicated in the fraud. The Chinese Academy of Engineering has suspended an author's candidacy to be an academician.

The work group has taken measures to clean up the online academic atmosphere and the number of links to websites selling papers and relevant advertisements have been obviously reduced, the work group said.

It also suggested that certain implicated third-party institutions be investigated.

In early July, CAST issued a guideline on academic ethics, calling on the country's scientists and researchers to be self-disciplined and strongly oppose academic dishonesty.

He noted that relevant departments are creating stricter regulations on dealing with academic fraud.

Improved academic management systems will be set up in universities, colleges and research institutes to track and evaluate the academic levels of scientists and researchers, and to strengthen the examination of academic achievements due for publishing.","Fri, 28 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['xinhua', 'china', 'fraud', 'investigation', 'authors', 'focus', 'result', 'institutions', 'fabricated', 'national', 'work', 'group', 'papers', 'announces', 'peer', 'academic']",

30,30,FL-2017-000097-CHN,"Seven years after the Swat floods, how prepared are we if disaster strikes again? - DAWN.com",https://www.dawn.com/news/1347780,"My last visit to Swat, once known idyllically as the emerald valley, was after massive floods had struck the region around this time in 2010. I remember sitting on the banks of the picturesque Swat River on the roadside, and being told: “See that pile of bricks on the other side? That’s all that remains of Mullah Fazlullah’s madrassa. It was swept away instantly by the floods.”

For years the former princely state of Swat, famous for its fruit orchards, snow-clad mountains, Buddhist stupas and trout-filled rivers, was a popular tourist destination – its hotels were clean and its people well-educated, at least in the main towns.

In 2007, the Taliban began taking control of the region, shutting down hotels and even destroying them along with schools. Anyone who had any means started leaving Swat until the army moved into the area to flush out the militants in May 2009.

The army operation, though bloody, did not last very long and by July 2009, the internally displaced persons of Swat Valley, began to return to their war-torn homes and villages.

I was told that there had been a nexus between the Taliban and the timber mafia which operates in the north of Pakistan. Wherever the Taliban grabbed power (as they did in Swat and Waziristan), protected forests were cut down and exploited with no regard for consequences.

Experts say that without trees and thick biomass to slow down the water flow, the flooding of 2010 took on greater intensity as the water, undeterred by surrounding vegetation, flowed at a faster speed.

When the Swat River burst its banks due to the unprecedented torrential rains that fell over the Hindu Kush and Karakoram, people barely had time to escape from their homes.

The locals say one or two heavy cloudbursts are enough to cause a flash flood. In late July 2010, there were as many as a dozen cloudbursts in a row. There was no modern early warning system in place. This kind of flooding had not happened in this region since 1929.

The Swat River feeds into the Kabul River, which in turn meets the Indus River in Attock on the border with Punjab. The Indus, overflowing with water from the upstream, wreaked havoc in Southern Punjab and all along Sindh where it flattens out in the plains.

The tsunami from the sky swept away over a million homes, killing more than 2000 people and leaving up to 20 million people homeless.

“What happened was that a cooler, westerly system over the north of the country interacted with hot, moisture laden winds from the east and caused a series of cloudbursts”, explained Dr Qamrul Zaman Chaudhry, who was the head of the Pakistan Meteorological Department office in Islamabad when I interviewed him back in 2010. “Extreme weather events are on the rise and their intensity is also increasing”, he had warned.

Dr Chaudhry, after leaving the Met office later that year, went on to author Pakistan’s National Climate Change Policy that was launched in 2013.

The policy was shelved for a while, and now needs to be urgently revised and updated. There are proposals to fast track it under the new Climate Change Act 2016 which was passed by the Senate in March this year.

Neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, India and Nepal have in the meantime all come up with climate change action plans that are already being implemented.

In Bangladesh for example, they have FM radios advising people about flooding and people know exactly where to run to for safety – even a school child knows what climate change is and what can be done about it.

Currently, Pakistan has one of the lowest forest covers in the region. I was recently shocked to learn that according to the Food and Agricultural Organisation’s Global Forests Resources Assessment 2015, Pakistan’s forest cover is an abysmal 1.9% (percentage of land cover). Much of this forest cover (around 40%) is located in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, which has 17% of its land covered by natural forests.

The Billion Tree Tsunami Afforestation Project in KP (including Swat) involving large scale afforestation is a positive step implemented by the provincial government to prevent future floods.

However, disaster preparedness in Pakistan has to reach right down to the grassroots level and become mainstream in the process. Also, land-use planning is an area that requires much needed attention.

The disaster was made worse by the rapid growth in Pakistan’s population and the struggle to find land for housing. People exposed themselves to great danger by building homes in dry riverbeds or too close to the rivers.

The widespread destruction in the country, from the mountains to the coastline, showed our extreme vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change and drew international attention.

The floods were described as “the worst natural disaster the United Nations has responded to in its 65-year history”, by then Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. At one point, approximately one fifth of Pakistan’s total land area was underwater due to the flooding.

The nation’s worst calamity ruined roads, bridges, schools, health clinics, electricity and communications in Swat and affected many other districts. After the initial rescue and relief work done by the army, NGOs and the government focused on reviving Swat’s economy and rebuilding hotels, schools and other infrastructure lost to war and floods.

Hotels in Swat finally started re-opening their doors in 2011 to receive tourists in the summer season. This year a record number of tourists went to Swat, and the hotels were overbooked.

I have not been back to Swat for a few years now, but local resident Ehsanullah, who is a board member of the Sarhad Rural Support Programme told me recently: “I would say normalcy has returned to Swat. Most of the infrastructure has been rebuilt – even the hotels right next to the River Swat! Call it greed or short memory, but people have rebuilt the hotels that were swept away by the floods of 2010. In fact, people have forgotten about the floods and the militancy to a large extent.”

Everyone hopes that floods on the scale of 2010 never hit Pakistan again. Unfortunately, the climate change experts warn us otherwise.

LANZHOU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Even during the dog days of summer, Zhang Guosen, 50, is hard at work in a greenhouse in Jiuquan, northwest China's Gansu Province. All around him, tomatoes, cucumbers and gourds grow in rows.

Zhang is head of the vegetable division under the Suzhou District Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Bureau and is responsible for providing technical guidance on greenhouse cultivation.

""We used to think it was impossible to grow vegetables in the barren Gobi Desert,"" Zhang said.

Located in the western Hexi Corridor, an important part of the ancient Silk Road, Jiuquan is notorious for droughts and barren land covered with sand and gravel.

A fragile ecosystem and lack of water have limited the development of agriculture.

The local government has come up with measures to help farmers, including building greenhouses and introducing organic soilless cultivation.

""We can take advantage of the abundance of sunshine in the desert to grow vegetables,"" Zhang said.

The greenhouses are built with sand and gravel. Locally sourced plant and animal waste is used in place of soil and fertilizer in the soilless cultivation, according to Zhang.

Compared to traditional vegetable cultivation, the cost of soilless cultivation in the greenhouses is lower because there is no need to buy extra fertilizers and pesticides. In addition, crop quality is guaranteed because of organic farming.

""We adopted micro-spray irrigation technology, which can save about 40 percent of water used in traditional agriculture methods,"" Zhang said.

Research and development institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Gansu Agricultural University have helped the district introduce advanced technology, including wireless remote controlled equipment, multi-functional data collection systems, and carbon-dioxide generators.

""The equipment can be used to remotely monitor and change the temperature, humidity and concentration of carbon dioxide in the greenhouses,"" said Zhang. ""Farmers can view the data on mobile apps.""

So far, around 786.7 hectares of greenhouses have been set up in the district, and crops have been expanded to include mushrooms and grapes.

The greenhouses have also indirectly contributed to the prevention of land desertification in the Gobi Desert region.","Wed, 26 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['xinhua', 'china', 'cultivation', 'zhang', 'growing', 'soilless', 'grow', 'water', 'greenhouses', 'district', 'vegetables', 'desert', 'used', 'gobi']",

BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China's success in reforesting the once barren Kubuqi Desert has seen the region gradually prosper in the development of the green economy, while the country seeks to share and promote the model worldwide.

The seventh Kubuqi International Desert Forum kicked off Saturday in the Kubuqi Desert in northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, attracting delegates and experts from home and abroad to discuss desertification.

Kubuqi is the seventh largest desert in China, covering an area of 18,600 square kilometers. It was once the source of frequent sandstorms hitting Beijing.

Over the past three decades, farmers and herdsmen in Kubuqi planted Chinese medicinal herbs, such as liquorice, to improve soil, built photovoltaic power stations for electricity and fostered tourism.

These efforts not only contributed to the greening of more than 6,000 square kilometers of Kubuqi, but also lifted 102,000 people out of poverty.

The core of success at Kubuqi is its sustainable business model, and the establishment of a system that incorporates policy instruments, private sector investment and active participation of locals, according to a policy report from the United Nations Environment Programme.

The greening project in Kubuqi has offered a model for the world to tackle desertification, said representatives of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.

China has made great progress in the fight against desertification in the past few years, with shrinking degraded land and reduced poverty in desertified areas.

The area of desertified land in the country shrank by an annual average of 1,980 square km in 2010-2014, a sharper decline than the 1,717 square km for 2005-2009, and 1,283 square km for 2000-2004

For the 2016-2020 period, China aims to rehabilitate 10 million hectares of desertified land and turn more than half of the country's reclaimable desert into green land.

In early September, China will host a United Nations meeting on fighting desertification in Inner Mongolia, which is expected to draw a roadmap to end desert expansion by 2030.","Sat, 29 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['xinhua', 'model', 'united', 'desertification', 'offers', 'km', 'chinas', 'nations', 'kubuqi', 'square', 'land', 'desertified', 'desert', 'solution']",

ABOARD KEXUE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese-developed underwater robot Tansuo had collaborative underwater operations with the unmanned submersible Faxian in the South China Sea on Wednesday.

It is the first time that the two types of submersible have performed simultaneous underwater explorations.

The robot started to make a 10-hour dive at 6:40 a.m.to obtain camera images and collect real-time data in a 0.36-square-km area of the South China Sea.

The unmanned submersible, which carried a raman spectrometer, dived at 9:30 a.m. to measure marine physical and chemical parameters in the area.

The Chinese research vessel Kexue, carrying both the Tansuo and Faxian, started its maritime scientific expedition on July 10 in the South China Sea.

Previously, China's research vessel had to monitor an underwater robot's operations and could not simultaneously conduct other explorations after the underwater vehicle dived into the sea.","Wed, 26 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['xinhua', 'china', 'underwater', 'submersibles', 'vessel', 'sea', 'research', 'chinese', 'submersible', 'unmanned', 'south', 'tansuo', 'explore', 'kexue']",

HARARE, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is benefitting from lucrative business deals with China, with the Asian giant becoming the biggest injector of foreign direct investment (FDI) in this southern African country.

The Zimbabwe Investment Authority approved 929 million U.S. dollars of FDI in 2015 with more than half of it from China.

""We would want to see them invest more in value addition and more on technology transfer and share more of their knowledge and expertise with local business people,"" ZIA spokesperson Nixon Kanyemba told Xinhua Friday.

""During the past couple of years alone we have seen the Chinese taking a keen interest in Zimbabwe's agriculture, energy and tourism sectors,"" said Joseph Ngwawi, head of the Regional Economic Development Institute at the Southern Africa Research and Documentation Center.

""We are bringing about 30 million dollars per month into Zimbabwe. China has become the largest source of foreign currency in Zimbabwe,"" the Financial Gazette, a Zimbabwe-based weekly English newspaper quoted Xing Shanshan, vice secretary-general of the Chinese Federation of Zimbabwe as saying.

Among the largest foreign importers is Chinese tobacco company Tianze, which helped revive the country's tobacco output which had plummeted to a low of 48 million kilograms in 2008.

Since inception, the company has injected 40 million dollars annually in interest free loans and subsidized inputs, in addition to free technical support, training and other services to its contracted farmers.

Through its support, Zimbabwe's tobacco output has rebounded and reached 217 million kilograms in 2014, slightly short of peak production of 231 million kilograms in 2001.

""Chinese investment in agriculture has to a large extent sustained Zimbabwe's tobacco industry through the outgrower scheme operated by Chinese firms. In addition to providing capital for farmers, the outgrower scheme has guaranteed a ready market for Zimbabwean tobacco and ensured viability of the sector,"" Ngwawi said.

In the area of infrastructural development, Chinese companies are taking the lead in power plant construction.

Chinese companies have struck multi-million dollar deals for solar power stations in Zimbabwe to help this country build its first batch of solar plants.

In 2015, power generating entity the Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) signed an agreement with Intratrek Zimbabwe which would work with Chinese engineering, procurement and construction partner CHINT Electric to build a 202-million-dollar plant in Matabeleland South Province.

It also signed agreements with Chinese companies to build the other two solar power stations in Zimbabwe.

All three projects will generate 100 megawatts each to feed 300 megawatts into the strained national grid currently struggling at less than 1,000 megawatts against peak demand of 2,200 megawatts.

""Solar power plants are quicker to construct and are quite suitable for phased construction. As the technology matures, prices are expected to be going down so that it can come at an affordable tariff,"" a spokesperson for ZPC's parent company ZESA Holding said.

Many Zimbabweans have interacted with the Chinese at various levels. For those in Harare, capital of Zimbabwe, the most recognizable Chinese feature is the imposing Long Cheng Plaza, a mall to the west of the city where they shop, enjoy Chinese cuisine and even hold parties and weddings in the glamorous amusement park.

The mall, built by Chinese Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Corporation (AFECC) at an estimated cost of 200 million U.S. dollars, opened in December 2013.

While engaging in economic activities, the company has also done some philanthropic work and brought in eye surgeons to perform cataract operations on many Zimbabweans and has also given donations towards flood mitigation and food aid.","Sat, 29 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['xinhua', 'help', 'zimbabwean', 'dollars', 'zimbabwes', 'company', 'investments', 'tobacco', 'zimbabwe', 'economy', 'boost', 'foreign', 'power', 'chinese', 'million']", 
36,36,FL-2017-000097-CHN,An unusual weather phenomenon explains why eastern and western India are flooding - Scroll.in,https://scroll.in/article/844887/an-unusual-weather-phenomenon-explains-why-eastern-and-western-india-are-flooding,"More than 7,000 people have been relocated in Gujarat, and schools in two districts of Rajasthan shut after a third consecutive day of heavy rainfall battered parts of Saurashtra, northern Gujarat and southern Rajasthan. The India Meterological Department has also issued warnings for intense rain in parts of Odisha, West Bengal, Jharkhand and eastern Chhattisgarh at least until Tuesday. Six districts in Odisha have been at risk of floods and bus services suspended in Midnapore in West Bengal.

This heavy rain has developed because of an unusual formation of the monsoon trough, an area of low pressure that generates intense rainfall. Low pressure regions develop frequently over the Bay of Bengal and move West or North West, drawing rain to the northern regions of the country. This year, the pattern has been different, with two separate depressions present at the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal at the same time.

“This time, a depression formed over the Bay of Bengal and simultaneously also at the Arabian Sea,” said Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist at Skymet Advisory, a private weather forecasting company. “The monsoon trough is now in a dumbbell-like position, which is rare.”

This is the second such weather system to have developed over Gujarat in this month, Palawat said. In the second week of July, a similar depression developed over South East Uttar Pradesh and travelled to Gujarat across Madhya Pradesh, leading to heavy rains and floods at that time.

The present system developed around Odisha around July 21 and moved to Gujarat via Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Madhya Pradesh. This system will now move towards South West Rajasthan over the next two days before it reduces and dissipates.

“This depression or low pressure area is formed if there is warming over the ocean,” Palawat said. “Normally, it travels North West, but for the last four to five years, we have begun to see this pattern of the depression travelling in a westerly trend.”

Before this, he said, the normal monsoon pattern was that depressions that developed in the Bay of Bengal would travel North West instead of West. This, he added, is the reason central India has had higher rainfall in this period and North India less rain each year.

In all, India has had 3% more than normal rainfall so far, said Charan Singh, a scientist with the National Weather Forecasting Centre at the India Meterological Department, with parts of Gujarat and Jharkhand receiving up to 200 millimetres of rain on Sunday. However, three of 36 subdivisions have received highly deficient rains. These are in Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

The red and yellow colours on the map shows places with deficient rainfall, while the blue shows excess rainfall.

River basins and reservoirs full

While flooding is common in eastern parts of India in July, this remains a relatively limited occurrence in the West. And heavy rains explain only one part of why parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan are facing such severe floods. Other reasons include their soil composition and drainage systems.

“Most rivers in Gujarat outfall into the Arabian Sea,” said VD Roy, director of flood forecasting and management at the Central Water Commission in Delhi, which has also been issuing flood advisories. “River flow is also very mild in Saurashtra and Kutch and there was a four metre high tide in the sea. That is why water was not draining.”

Now that the tide has come down, he added, floods would recede in these parts of Gujarat.

Roy said that the problem was different in Rajasthan, where the soil composition affects water drainage. Rivers such as Luni in Barmer drain westward, but because of the sandy soil, they does not have well-defined channels.

“Whatever rainfall occurs on the ground, it will get accumulated in low lying areas and doesn’t get drained out into the Arabian Sea,” Roy said. “And the morphological structure of that area is such that there is an impervious layer below the top soil, which is why water is not getting percolated below.”

A look at the river basin rainfall map of India shows just how unusual the rainfall is in this part of the country. The Luni river basin has received, as of July 23, 72% more rain than normal. The Sabarmati and Mahi basins have received 42% and 26% more than normal.

A third reason for flooding lies in reservoirs getting full. In Rajasthan, the soil might prevent too much permeation or runoff towards basins, but in Gujarat, 30 of 133 reservoirs are now 100% full, Roy said and 12 between 90% to 100% full. The Central Water Commission identifies such reservoirs as causes for high alert as states are likely to release excess water from these to prevent damage to the structures.

Agriculture affected

Flooding in these states will definitely impact agriculture in these areas, said Anand Sharma, scientist with the Agromet Advisory division of the India Meterological Department.

“Cotton and groundnut will be affected in parts of Gujarat where there has been more than 30 cm of rain and where there is waterlogging,” Sharma said. “Farmers in parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan may have to undertake resowing.”

Gujarat, he said, already had formed contingency plans for planting gram, sunflower and castor oil in the place of damaged crops after the inundation in early July. Large tracts of paddy were also destroyed in parts of Assam, he added. Nearly 60,000 people in nine districts have been affected by floods in Assam.","Tue, 25 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://s01.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/facebook/844887-63957-ykdqtsgpem-1500958181.jpg,"['flooding', 'west', 'phenomenon', 'soil', 'unusual', 'eastern', 'parts', 'water', 'rain', 'india', 'western', 'sea', 'rainfall', 'explains', 'weather', 'rajasthan', 'gujarat']",

Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari along with Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal are expected to make a formal announcement about the project on Wednesday.

A brainchild of Sonowal, the project proposal was submitted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 18 July and the state government is now awaiting a response from the latter.

Sonowal, who confirmed the move to Mint, said, “I met the Prime Minister on Tuesday, 18 July, and submitted a proposal to him requesting conversion of 5000 km of river embankment to road-cum-embankment.""

He added that the state government has been also holding discussions with World Bank to help the state control floods through investments and technology as they did for China.

During the state government’s discussion with World Bank, the latter told that Bramhaputra’s threat perception is twice that of rivers like Nile, Mississippi, Amazon, and Huang He put together. Therefore, we are aggressively pushing the project, said Sonowal.

The Assam chief minister said that it was because of the Prime Minister’s guidance that the state government was able to come up with this plan and the transport ministry has agreed to build an expressway along the Brahmaputra river at a cost of Rs40,000 crore.

He said the sole purpose of the embankment is to protect people, the village economy and land against floods, but in the last 70 years of its existence, no repair work has been done. As a result, the existing embankment have become porous and weak.

A senior road ministry official, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Construction of road-cum-embankment to check floods is possible but it would be in certain sections and not along the complete river course as there would be certain stretches where river cannot be controlled.""

The official added that the project was discussed with Gadkari in April during his Assam visit.

However, environmentalists raise a concern saying such a move could increase the intensity of floods rather than curtailing them. Manoj Mishra of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan said, “It is a foolish idea. Strengthening embankments as a measure to flood mitigation has never worked. The experience of last 50 years and Assam’s neighbouring state Bihar is a testimony to it. Strengthening embankments increases the intensity of water which is more catastrophic.""

Mishra is an environmentalist who has been fighting for cleanliness and revival of river Yamuna.

Sakon Nakhon has been severely damaged by floods, with many areas - including the municipality and its airport - pounded by heavy rain since the early hours of Friday.

The water level continued to rise in Muang and other districts of the northeastern province, cutting off several villages from the outside world.

The airport was forced to close until 3pm on Saturday after a runway was submerged on Friday afternoon, with all flights cancelled.

Airports Department director-general Darun Saengchai said the water level on the runway was about 40 centimetres high, and deemed too dangerous for aircraft. The department will assess the situation day by day before reopening the airport, he added.

The water level in some areas of the municipality reached up to one metre high, and flooding stranded more than 60 people at the Hop Inn budget hotel in Muang district.

Rescue workers are helping the stranded people by supplying them with food before evacuating them for higher ground. About 100 people were taken to makeshift shelters set up near the provincial hall, according to the provincial office of the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department.

Sakon Nakhon governor Witthaya Chanchalong called the flooding in the province the worst in 20 years, and said the crisis was exacerbated by runoff from Phupan mountain.

Deputy governor Suriya Wiriyasawad expected more water runoff from Phupan through the municipality to Nong Han, the country's second largest freshwater lake, later in the day.

Sukhothai province was also ravaged by floods after the Yom River burst its banks, dumping water into Sri Samrong and Muang districts on Thursday night. Officials were putting up barriers to prevent more water flowing into the district towns.

The Meteorological Department warned that Sakon Nakhon and Sukhothai were among 25 provinces - largely in the northern and northeastern regions - braced for downpours and possible flash floods later Friday, even though storm Songa is losing steam.

The Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department on Friday ordered officials in 16 provinces to closely monitor the weather and prepare mobile units to help people in case of emergency.

NANJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China's online to offline (O2O) retail giant Suning has entered the auto sales market by opening its first automobile supermarket in Jiangsu Province.

The Suning.com Auto Supermarket in the provincial capital Nanjing, has brought in 3 million yuan (445,000 U.S. dollars) in car sales revenue and another 200,000 yuan in accessories since its opening on July 15.

A total of 160,000 customers had visited the site, part of the existing Xinjiekou outlet of Suning Plaza, as of Wednesday.

Consumers can also browse its products on the online shopping platform, Suning.com.

For customers who previously had to visit multiple 4S stores of different brands before choosing their ideal vehicle, the supermarket has saved them time and energy, said Gan Wen, manager of the outlet.

Twelve foreign and domestic automobile brands are currently available, including BMW, Audi, Maserati, Buick and Trumpchi. Two 4S stores, including a second-hand car dealer, are also part of the supermarket

In addition to auto purchases via installments or full payment, customers can also choose a rent-to-own scheme, a common practice in western countries but rare in China.

Under this scheme, a customer can rent a vehicle and will end up purchasing it after paying the equivalent of the purchase price.

Customers can drive away in a new car three hours after placing an order, with no bank loan application needed, said Gan.

Midday Thursday, several customers visited the supermarket after shopping at Suning's home appliance department upstairs.

Wang Liming came to inquire about the Audi A6L during his lunch break.

""The model sells for 430,000 yuan, a little bit higher than the carmaker's guide price, but the down payment as low as 70,000 yuan and the free insurance and plate installment services are really attractive,"" he said. ""Price is the primary factor that I take into consideration.""

The auto supermarket opened after a regulation on auto sales took effect on July 1, allowing dealers to sell cars and provide after-sales services without authorization from an auto brand.

The new regulation is expected to revitalize the auto market, as car markets and car e-commerce will be booming in the future.

""The Suning.com Auto Supermarket actually serves as a platform where 4S dealers, part stores, auto service providers and e-commerce shops are combined,"" said Liu Donghao, president of the digital company of Suning Commerce Group Co., Ltd.

Liu added that the O2O sales platform welcomes auto service providers and dealers to cooperate and share their resources for a win-win outcome.

Suning will open 100 auto supermarkets across China, all of which will be located on its own property, according to Liu.

The stores may have different themes, such as SUVs, sports cars or auto maintenance, he said.

Suning, initially a home appliance retailer, has expanded its business to the real estate, cultural, finance and investment industries with a total of 500 million clients.

""We hope a certain ratio of our clients will be attracted to the auto market,"" said Liu.

While the O2O giant is ambitious about its new sector, 4S dealers doubt their market prospective.

Chen Hao, president of the 4S dealer Xiezhong Auto, said although Suning has advantages in its customer flow and possibly prices, it will take time before it can standardize its services as 4S dealers do.

""Service is the key in the competition,"" said Chen.","Thu, 27 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['xinhua', 'dealers', 'market', 'giant', 'supermarket', 'stores', 'chinas', 'eyes', '4s', 'sales', 'car', 'auto', 'suning', 'o2o', 'yuan']",

Incessant rainfall and floods continue to ravage districts of the Tarai region, with floodwaters sweeping away hundreds of houses, knocking off electricity poles and inundating scores of VDCs and municipalities.

Districts like Sunsari, Morang, Saptari, Siraha, Bara, Rautahat, Nawalparasi, Banke and Bardiya are the worst hit. Mukund Upadhayaya, 60, of Saraswar-3 of Siraha district was swept away by the Kamala river today as he was returning from Saraswarnath Temple, a local Shrawan Yadav said. Some 1,575 families have been hit and 253 families are displaced in Banke district, the Banke chapter of Nepal Red Cross Society said. Rains and flood caused 101 houses to collapse in Nepalgunj municipality, Kamdi and Bankatwa VDCs.

Due to waterlogging, Nepalgunj bazaar is closed and consumer items are in short supply, Yagya Bahadur Basnet of Dhamboji said. As power supply has been cut off since yesterday morning, local newspapers in Nepalgunj didn’t hit the stands today. FM stations also stopped transmission, while government offices and schools were closed. People of Holiya and Betani VDCs have been marooned due to flood in the Rapti River, police said. “We will go to the flood-hit areas in a helicopter tomorrow,” acting CDO Krishna Acharya said.

A report from Bardiya said waters from the overflowing Babai River flooded hundreds of houses. Mohammedpur, Suryapatawa, Sorahawa, Nyalapur and Belawa VDCs and six wards of Gulariya municipality were inundated, while 40 houses collapsed in Sorhawaa VDC, police said.

The flood-hit have been putting up in school buildings, ASI Surendra Shah said. Floods also blocked the Gulariya-Nepalgunj road and knocked down electricity poles. In Sunsari, floods have swept away 155 houses.

Relief for disaster-hit

Kathmandu, July 27, 2007

The government today announced an immediate relief package for the victims of floods and landslides.

Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula today informed the Parliament about the formation of a Natural Disaster Victims Relief Fund and management committees under the coordination of joint-secretary Pratap Kumar Pathak. Sitaula said the committees have initiated relief measures in the flood and landslide affected districts.

“However, the committees have not been able to work smoothly in distributing the relief materials due to the adverse weather conditions in some parts of the country,” Sitaula told today’s session of the Parliament. He said that the government has decided to provide immediate compensation of Rs 15,000 each to the families of those who are killed due to floods and landslides.

He also said the government has decided to provide Rs 10,000 each to those whose houses have been completely destroyed and Rs 5,000 to those whose houses have been partially damaged.","Fri, 28 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://thehimalayantimes.com/theme_himalayantimes/images/no-image.jpg,"['continue', 'hit', 'tarai', 'vdcs', 'floods', 'rs', 'ravage', 'tht', 'river', 'relief', 'sitaula', 'houses', 'ago', 'nepalgunj', 'today']",

47,47,FL-2017-000097-CHN,"北京,有2000万人假装在生活: Viral essay about ""fake lives"" of Beijingers is blocked in China after lighting up WeChat and Weibo - Quartz",https://qz.com/1039681/a-beautiful-essay-critiquing-the-fake-lives-of-beijingers-is-blocked-after-lighting-up-chinese-social-media/,"An online essay titled “Beijing Has 20 Million People Pretending to Have a Life Here” (“北京,有2000万人假装在生活,” full English translation here ) by Chinese writer and blogger Zhang Wumao (张五毛) became a viral hit on WeChat and Weibo after it was published on the author’s WeChat account on July 23.

The essay is a witty yet powerful critique of Beijing and its residents. Over the last decade, and especially over the past few years, Beijing has undergone enormous changes. The city is expanding, high-rise buildings are mushrooming, while old hutong areas are bricked up and familiar neighborhoods demolished for the sake of the city’s metamorphosis into an “international metropolis.”

“What Beijingers increasingly feel is the suffocation of the smog and the high cost of housing. They cannot move, they cannot breathe.”

According to Mr. Zhang, the city’s rapid transformation has turned it into a place with no identity, a place that nobody can call home. The essay argues that Beijing has been overrun by migrant workers or waidiren (外地人, “people from outside the city”), and that these “outsiders” have turned China’s capital into a place with staggering house prices and heavy traffic that lacks soul. The city no longer really belongs to native Beijingers, Zhang writes, as they cannot even recognize their old neighborhoods anymore.

The essay describes how Beijing has become so big, so full, and so expensive, that life has virtually become unsustainable. The result of Beijing’s transformation, according to the post, is that its residents, both locals and immigrants, just “pretend to live there,” leading “fake lives.”

Zhang Guochen

WeChat’s “Today” overview showing dozens of mentions of Zhang’s essay earlier this week. (via zhihu.com)

Zhang Wumao, whose real name is Zhang Guochen (张国臣), is an author born in the early 1980s. He is from Luonan, Shaanxi, and came to Beijing at the age of 25 in 2006. A year later he started blogging. He previously published the novels Spring is Burning (春天在燃烧) and Princess’s Tomb (公主坟).

Zhang’s online essay about Beijing spread like wildfire on WeChat and Weibo on July 23. It was viewed over 5 million times within an evening and soon became a trending article on WeChat. It triggered wide debate across Chinese social media on the lives of people in Beijing.

On July 24 and 25, the essay was also republished by various Chinese media, including Tencent News, iFeng, and Sohu.com.

But on July 25, the full text was removed from all social media accounts and Chinese online news sites. Its hashtag on Weibo (#北京有2000万人假装在生活#) is now no longer accessible.

The article also disappeared from Zhang’s WeChat account.

Zhang’s Wechat account shows that the article from July 23 has now been deleted.

On Quora-like discussion platform Zhihu.com, one person said (link in Chinese) the essay was destined to become a hype: “This is a typical Wechat viral article. It ridicules Beijing + it talks about migrant workers + real estate market + and state of life. As it contains all of these elements in one article, the author just intended for this to become a hit.”

A sensitive essay

Zhang’s essay is divided into five parts. In the first part, he explains that Beijingers often seem inhospitable; the city is so huge and congested that people simply cannot find the time to see their friends in other parts of the city.

Beijing is really too big; so big that it is simply not like a city at all. It is equivalent to 2.5 times Shanghai, 8.4 times Shenzhen, 15 times Hong Kong, 21 times New York, or 27 times Seoul. When friends from outside come to Beijing, they think they’re close to me. But actually, we’re hardly in the same city at all. For 10 years, Beijing has been controlling housing, controlling traffic, and controlling the population. But this pancake is only getting wider and bigger, so much that when a school friend from Xi’an calls me to say he’s in Beijing and I ask him where he is, he tells me: “I am at the 13th Ring.” Beijing is a tumor, and no one can control how fast it is growing; Beijing is a river, and no one can draw its borders. Beijing is a believer, and only Xiong’an can bring salvation.

The second part, which is titled “Beijing actually belongs to outsiders” (北京其实是外地人的北京), claims that Beijing is one of the most beloved cities in China because of its rich cultural heritage and long history, but this is something that is only of value to people from outside the city.

In the 11 years since I’ve come to Beijing, I have been to the Great Wall 11 times, 12 times the Imperial Palace, 9 times to the Summer Palace, and 20 times to the Bird’s Nest. I feel emotionless about this city’s great architecture and long history. … Going into the Forbidden City, I only see one empty house after the other—it’s less interesting than the lively pigsties we have in my native village. Upon mentioning Beijing, many people first think of the Palace Museum, Houhai, 798; they think of history, culture, and high-rise buildings. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? It’s good! Does it make us proud? It does! But you can’t make food out of these things. What Beijingers increasingly feel is the suffocation of the smog and the high cost of housing. They cannot move, they cannot breathe.

He then goes on to mock the old residents of Beijing, who still have the upper hand in the real-estate market despite the flood of new immigrants, all owning “five-room houses.” The old Beijingers lead very different lives from the migrant workers, who are caught in a negative spiral of hard work, no social life, and finding a place to settle down.

In Beijing, the migrant workers, who have no real estate from previous generations, are destined to be trapped in their house for life. They strive for over a decade to buy an apartment the size of a bird cage; then spend another decade struggling to get a house that has two rooms rather than one. If that goes well, congratulations, you can now consider an apartment in the school district. With a house in the school district, children can attend Tsinghua or Peking University. But Tsinghua graduates will still not be able to afford a room in that district. They will then either need to stay crammed together in the old shabby family apartment, or start from scratch, struggling for another apartment.

In the final part of the essay, however, Zhang shows his sympathy for the old residents of Beijing:

I once took a taxi to Lin Cui Road. Because I was afraid the driver wouldn’t know the way, I opened the navigation on my phone to help him find the way. He said he did not need the navigation because he knew that place. There was a flour mill there 30 years ago, he said, it was demolished 10 years ago, and they built low-income housing there. I asked him how he knew this so well. “That used to be my home,” he said, the sorrow showing in his face. I could hear nostalgia and resentment from the driver’s words. For Beijing’s new immigrants, the city is a distant place where they can’t stay; for Beijing’s old residents, the city is an old home they can’t return to. We, as outsiders, ridicule Beijing on the one hand, while on the other hand, we cherish our hometowns. But in fact, we can still go back to our hometown. It is still there. … But for the old Beijingers, there really is no way to go back to their hometown. It has changed with unprecedented speed. We can still find our grandfather’s old house. The majority of Beijingers can only find the location of their old homes through the coordinates on a map.

He concludes his article by highlighting the recent demolishment of old Beijing shops and restaurants, saying that the city is being renovated but is becoming less livable.

Those who chase their dreams of success are now escaping [Beijing]. They’re off to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, or the west coast of the United States. Those who’ve lost hope of chasing their dreams are also escaping. They return to Hebei, the northeast, their hometowns.

He ends by writing: “There are over 20 million people left in this city, pretending to live. In reality, there simply is no life in this city. Here, there are only some people’s dreams and everybody’s jobs.”

Chinese media responses

Despite censorship of the actual text, Zhang’s essay is widely discussed by Chinese official media.

State media outlet People’s Daily (@人民日报) wrote on Weibo:

The essay “Beijing Has 20 Million People Pretending to Live There” is a viral hit but is not approved of. There really is such a thing as the “Big City Disease,” and we do not need to pretend as if people in first-tier cities are not struggling and facing hardships. But in Beijing, both locals and outsiders are alive and kicking; they are all the more real because of their dreams. Making a living is hard, but it is the days of watching flowers blossom and wilt that are full of life. The city and its people don’t have it easy, but they have to show some tolerance for each other and then they can both succeed.

“For Beijing’s new immigrants, the city is a distant place where they can’t stay; for Beijing’s old residents, the city is an old home they can’t return to.”

Xinhua News Agency also published a response to the article titled: “Lives in the City Cannot Be Fake” (“一个城市的生活无法“假装“). Lashing out against Mr. Zhang, it wrote that: “Beijing has no human warmth, Beijing is a city of outsiders, old Beijingers can’t go back to their city—behind every one of these sentences is not the ‘fakeness’ of Beijing, but the clamor of the author’s emotions about ‘coming to Beijing.'”

State broadcaster CCTV (@央视新闻) also responded to the essay on Weibo, saying:

Over the past few days, the essay “Beijing Has 20 Million People Pretending to Live There” has exploded on the Internet, but how the text portrays the contrast between old Beijingers and new immigrants is exaggerated, and it polarizes the relationship between native Beijingers and outsiders. In reality, Beijing is not as cold as it is described in the essay. Everyone already knows that it’s not easy living in a big city. The future of Beijing is in the hands of competent, daring, and hardworking people who pursue their dreams.

A storm of debate

On social media, many netizens commented on the state media’s responses to Zhang, saying they were tired of the repeated emphasis on “people’s dreams.” One person said: “My belly is empty, what are you talking about dreams for?! Dreams cannot guarantee our most basic needs for survival.”

Many people on Weibo and QQ (link in Chinese) also applauded Zhang’s essay for being “well-written,” “honest,” and “real.”

“What on earth gave him the courage to speak on behalf of 20 million Beijing people?”

But there are also those who do not agree with the essay and take offense at how it describes Beijingers leading “fake” or “pretense” lives. A Beijing resident nicknamed Little Fish (@小小的爱鱼) commented: “What on earth gave him the courage to speak on behalf of 20 million Beijing people? I am one of these 20 million people, and sorry, but my life is not fake—I am living it.”

“I work overtime until 9pm, then take the bus and subway and won’t arrive home before 23:38, then quickly rinse my face and brush my teeth and roll into bed. But it’s still life. What life and being alive is all about ultimately is a personal issue,” said another netizen from Beijing (link in Chinese).

“Mr. Zhang,” one angry commenter wrote, “you can leave this cold and big city of Beijing, and go back to your ‘real’ life in that pigsty of yours that’s supposedly more imposing than the Forbidden City.”

The recent hype surrounding Zhang’s essay somewhat resembles the overnight buzz over the autobiographical essay of Beijing migrant worker Fan Yusu. That essay also described various hardships in the lives of Beijing migrant workers.

Fan Yusu’s essay and posts related to it were also taken offline after several days when discussions on the account spread across Chinese social media.

Zhang’s hit essay shows that the combination of writing about migrant workers, Beijing, real estate, and state of life is indeed bound to attract wide attention and debate on social media. Although it is also a recurring topic in China’s official media, those channels prefer to focus on the idea of hardworking people who pursue their (Chinese) dreams, rather than to spread a narrative about people living “fake lives” in a cold city.

One commenter says: “Whether you fake it or you try hard, it’s all okay: This is Beijing. It’s not livable, but you sure can make a living.”

BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The maternal mortality rate increased by nearly 25 percent in Beijing in 2016, the first year China fully adopted the two-child policy, according to a white paper issued Wednesday.

The maternal mortality rate reached 10.83 per 100,000 live births in 2016, up 24.6 percent from 2015, according to a report on health conditions in Beijing released by the municipal health and family planning commission.

China allowed all married couples to have two children in 2016. This followed an earlier policy easing in 2013, allowing couples to have a second child if either parent was an only child.

The latest change ended the one-child policy, which was implemented in the late 1970s to rein in a surging population.

Figures show 18.67 million new births were reported in China in 2016, up 11 percent on 2015. Among the new births, 45 percent were second children.

Gao Xiaojun, spokesman of the Beijing health commission, said more births had put pressure on limited obstetrical resources in the city, which was one of the reasons for the higher maternal mortality rate.

A large number of pregnant women, many elderly and more likely to suffer complications, neglected regular antenatal inspections, which also contributed to the high maternal mortality, he said.

Gao said the city would further train medical practitioners and strengthen publicity to encourage pregnant women to receive regular antenatal checks.","Wed, 26 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['xinhua', 'rate', 'beijing', 'women', 'second', 'births', 'policy', 'mortality', '2016', 'maternal', 'increases', 'health']",

Some 350 armed soldiers from the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces and from Prime Minister Hun Sen’s bodyguard unit were deployed on Wednesday to buttress the banks of the river with sandbags, according to provincial governor Un Chanda.

“We are ready to send more forces” if necessary, he said.

Yung Kimhoeung, deputy provincial head of administration, said a 14-year-old boy drowned in the province on Tuesday morning.

“He swam while there was flooding and drowned,” he said.

The river, which is a tributary of the Tonle Sap river, stood at 12.8 meters in Preah Vihear City as of yesterday evening, well over the emergency level of 11.5 meters, according to Mr. Chanda, who said the rising waters affected the provincial capital and four districts in the province as residents were moved to higher ground.

“We are organizing temporary shelters at a safe place and donating some food for them,” he said.

Keo Vy, spokesman for the National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM), said the situation would likely worsen as continued rain flushed down from higher elevations into rivers.

“It’s a change in weather caused by the storm in the region that…caused heavy rains in coastal provinces and the northern plateau,” Mr. Vy said.

Kompong Thom, Oddar Meanchey, Ratanakkiri, Preah Sihanouk and Kampot provinces had also experienced flooding caused by Sonca beginning on Monday.

The NCDM was still collecting data on the storm and could not yet say when it would pass, he said.

Sonca, the eighth tropical storm to hit Southeast Asia this year, made landfall in central Vietnam on Tuesday, the Bangkok Post reported, before starting to pass through Laos and northern Thailand, which were braced for torrential downpours.

Cambodia is feeling the effects of Sonca as it sweeps past neighboring countries, when it is predicted to weaken into a tropical depression.

National Road 4 was briefly submerged in Preah Sihanouk province’s Kompong Seila district, according to Mr. Vy, while at least 3,000 hectares of rice fields had been affected by flooding in Preah Vihear and Kompong Thom, with more damage in other provinces likely.

Authorities in Preah Vihear issued a statement on Tuesday urging locals to seek higher ground, while Kampot provincial authorities warned families yesterday to keep an eye on children.

Pov Rin, a 56-year-old farmer from Preah Vihear’s Sra Em Khang Choeung village in Choam Ksan district, said she was evacuated yesterday morning from her submerged home, with authorities preparing emergency shelter at a nearby hilltop pagoda.

50,50,FL-2017-000097-CHN,Severity of Assam floods heightens old fears about dams in the Brahmaputra basin - Scroll.in,https://scroll.in/article/844509/severity-of-assam-floods-heightens-old-fears-about-dams-in-the-brahmaputra-basin,"After the Ranganadi – a tributary of the Brahmaputra – overflowed and submerged large swathes of land in Assam’s Lakhimpur district on July 9, calls to decommission the dam on the river have grown loud again. The dam, people in Lakhimpur claimed, exacerbated the floods worse than ever this year.

The Assamese press has also heavily criticised the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Limited, the public-sector company that administers the dam.

Old accusation, new occasion

The accusation that the Ranganadi dam aggravates the problem of flooding in the downstream district of Lakhimpur is as old as the dam itself, which became operational in 2001.

The Ranganadi dam was touted as the North East’s first run-of-the-river dam. These dams differ from conventional dams as they do not have huge reservoirs but generate electricity by harnessing the energy of flowing water. The dam is located at Yazali in Arunachal Pradesh’s Lower Subansiri district. As water from the Ranganadi flows downstream from Arunachal Pradesh to enter Lakhimpur in Assam, the dam’s walls stop the flow. Then, a certain amount of the water is chanelled into a tunnel over a distance of 10 km. The tunnel drops 600 metres to another river called Dikrong. This is done so as to achieve the head – the difference in height – required for the water to rotate turbines that produce electricity.

Dikrong is one of the bigger north bank tributaries of the Brahmaputra. It originates in the Nyishi hills of Arunachal Pradesh, flows through the state’s capital Itanagar, before flowing downstream to the plains of Assam where it joins the Subansiri-Brahmaputra river system at Lakhimpur.

Environmentalists have contested the Ranganadi dam’s claim to run-of-the-river status, pointing out that the transfer of its waters through the artificial channel from Ranganadi to Dikrong has dried up the Ranganadi.

Besides, people living in the areas downstream say that the river bed has become shallow over the years as silt from the dam site at Yazali is periodically flushed into the Ranganadi river. While the exercise is imperative to keep the dam in good health, residents of Lakhimpur believe it has increased the frequency and intensity of flash floods in the district.

The North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Limited has consistently denied these allegations, which crop up every time there is a particularly harsh wave of floods in the district.

This year too, as news spread about the alleged role of the dam in the current wave of floods in Lakhimpur that has killed at least 11 people, the company said that the dam had, in fact, minimised damages. In a press-release, the company blamed the floods on the “incessant torrential rainfall in the catchment areas of river Ranganadi since June 30”.

Damage control

But with Assam’s civil society organisations refusing to buy that defence and threatening a mass agitation, the public sector organisation held a press conference at its headquarters in Shillong, where its chairman and managing director AG West Kharkongor addressed the media on July 18.

“There has been a lot of misinformation that the havoc that has been caused in the district has been attributed to the release of water by NEEPCO [North Eastern Electric Power Corporation],” Kharkongor reportedly said. He then went on to explain how the dam helped cushion the impact of the July 9 floods by diverting a portion of the Ranganadi’s water into the Dikrong.

Kharkongor was referring to the water that goes into producing electricity. As the Ranganadi is stopped by the walls of the dam, 160 cubic metres per second of its water is channeled into a tunnel. The water finally strikes three turbines with force, generating electricity. The chairman further added that inflow of water on July 9 had reached over 1,500 cubic metres per second, and since the capacity of Ranganadi’s reservoir was only 200 cubic metres per second, there was no choice but to release the excess water to protect the structure.

‘Abnormal and unusually fast’

However, Kharkongar’s first claim that the dam controlled the flood damage on July 9 was contradicted by the Ranganadi project’s senior manager, S Sharma.

Sharma told Scroll.in that the tunnel that transferred water from Ranganadi to Dikrong had “stopped working for some time” that day as the generator that drove the water in the tunnel malfunctioned, resulting in the water being released back into the Ranganadi. “It was a mechanical fault,” he said. “You cannot anticipate such things.” However, Sharma maintained that 160 cubic metres per second of water was a trivial quantity, and would have not have significantly added to the deluge. “It would have happened anyway,” he insisted.

According to Arup Kumar Sarma, professor of civil engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology in Guwahati, the significance of an extra 160 cubic metres per second of water was subjective. “It really depends on how much water Ranganadi could hold that day in the areas it overflowed,” he explained.

The capacity of the river is 1,291 cubic metres per second. People in Lakhimpur, thus, believe that a difference of 160 cubic metres per second may have made a difference. “We understand that they have to release water, and we have made peace with that,” said Dwarika Prasad, a resident of Gourighat Balijan village, one of the worst-affected places in the floods. “But since they have made the river bed shallow, even if a small amount is diverted it is a big respite [for people in downstream areas].”

A river that changes every season

By design, if the Ranganadi flow is greater than 160 cubic metres per second, the surplus water is released into the river downstream to protect the dam. In the winter, the river flow is, more often than not, less than that. Therefore, no water is released into the Ranganadi at all, which results in a practically dead river. “We can cross the river on foot in the winter,” several people living in downstream areas in Lakhimpur district said.

In the summer, however, as torrential showers strike the region, the river flow invariably exceeds 160 cubic metres per second. This leads to the release of water from the dam. The North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Limited argues that the water is the Ranganadi’s itself, so the dam could not possibly be held responsible for the floods.

The different natures of flooding

That is a contention that environmentalists and people living in downstream areas strongly disagree with. “This is not about the volume of the water,” claimed Partha Jyoti Das, head of the Water, Climate and Hazards Programme of the Guwahati-based non-profit Aaranyak. “The nature and patterns of the floods would have been very different in the absence of the dam. People living in downstream areas always lived with natural floods always, but with the dam, the river’s course has been altered and the nature of floods has completely changed. Yes, there would be floods even without the dam, but the hazards would be much less.”

Residents of the many downstream villages Scroll.in visited agreed, saying that the force of the water has become much greater ever since the dam came into existence. “You should see the way the water came this time,” said Dipen Bora of Amtala village, which was ravaged by the floods on July 9. “It did not seem like river water, it was like water in a drain.”

Also, people claim that the continuous flushing of sediments at the dam site at Yazali has raised the river bed significantly, so it was unfair to say that the dam has not increased the intensity of the floods.

National security vs research

However, Das, who is currently working on a report on the Ranganadi, conceded that in the absence of scientific data it was difficult to counter the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Limited’s claims. “The government just won’t release data to researchers, citing national security issues,” claimed Das, co-author of Damming Northeast India, a study of hydropower development in the region. “That is why NEEPCO gets away always.”

He added: “The last time there was a huge flood in 2008, IIT Guwahati was supposed to come out with a fact-finding report. The report hasn’t been made public till date.”

Other academics who have tried studying the Ranganadi also bemoaned the lack of transparency. “They can never be wrong technically, because they provide no information to prove them otherwise anyway,” said a researcher who had studied flood forecasting systems in context of the river, who did not want to be identified. “It is like being asked to validate black holes without a telescope or scientific equipment.”

In India, flow data of the rivers in the Indo-Gangetic and Brahmaputra basins is treated as classified and covered under the Official Secrets Act. This has often hampered research. For instance, in 2010, a government glaciologist VK Raina was refused access to his own work that he had done during his tenure in the Geological Survey of India, on the grounds of secrecy.

Of warnings

In Lakhimpur, however, people want something much simpler: an early warning system that informs them of the incoming water from the dam. “Earlier we’d see the river, and know what to expect and prepare accordingly,” said Keramat Ali, a resident of Bogoleejaan village near North Lakhimpur town, where the river wreaked havoc earlier this month. “But now with the dam, it all depends on when they release water. And now the water comes in much faster than earlier, so we have no time to react, and, say, take our cows to higher grounds at least, if nothing else.”

Although a siren goes off 30 minutes at the site of the dam before water is released, people living in downstream areas of Lakhimpur, which is almost 100 km from the dam, are too far to hear it. Additionally, the dam authorities inform Lakhimpur’s district administration, which is supposed to make public announcements.

According to people living in downstream areas of the district, the district administrator has often failed to warn people. Public announcements are rare. Even if they are made, it is only in and around the town or North Lakhimpur, said residents of villages along the river in Lakhimpur. “I’ve never heard any kind of public announcement, informing us of water being released,” said Bhadreshar Baruah of Amtala village.

Lakhimpur deputy commissioner Barun Bhuyan claimed information was erratic and often not relayed on time. “NEEPCO [North Eastern Electric Power Corporation] should also make public announcements in the downstream villages, but they do not,” he said. “After all, it is their dam.”

In 2015, the North East Electrical Power Corporation pledged to sponsor a community-based flood early warning system on the downstream of Ranganadi river in Lakhimpur. However, no such system exists, an official from the district administration claimed.

Professor Sarma of IIT-Guwahati said that since the water stopped by the gates of the dam came down with considerable force when released, it was important to have a series of alarms. “One alarm won’t work because of the distance, so there could be a series of alarms, each at a fixed distance from the previous [one],” he said. “It is called a relay alarm system, each alarm triggering off the next.”

The big dam looming

As Lakhimpur recovers from one of its worst floods in almost a decade, residents are keeping their fingers crossed. Even as they get used to the Ranganadi dam, they may have to confront a much bigger dam soon: the 2,000-megawatt Lower Subansiri hydropower project on the Subansiri river. (The Ranganadi dam’s power-generation capacity is 405 megawatts – almost one-fifth of the Lower Subansiri.)

The Subansiri is another tributary to the Brahmaputra, albeit much bigger than the Ranganadi. Construction of the dam has been kept on hold since 2011 following an order of the National Green Tribunal and mass protests by various indigenous groups.

But recently, the Assam Assembly’s voiced unanimous support for the project and the chief ministers of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh promised to fast-track it, so construction may resume soon.

In the wake of the floods, fears about the Lower Subanisiri project have increased even more among residents in Lakhimpur. “The Ranganadi, they say, is a small dam,” said a farmer in Bogoleejaan. “If a small dam can cause so much damage, I don’t know how much a big dam will.”

“Well, if they build that dam, our Lakhimpur will become a rich place,” remarked another resident of North Lakhimpur town. “After all, only the rich can afford to stay in water-proof houses on five-metre high platforms, isn’t it?”

51,51,FL-2017-000097-CHN,"‘Extreme’ El Niños to double in frequency under 1.5C of warming, study says - Carbon Brief",https://www.carbonbrief.org/extreme-el-ninos-double-frequency-under-one-point-five-celsius-warming-study,"The El Niño event of 2015-16 was one of the strongest on record, bringing flooding to much of South America, southern US and East Africa, and severe drought to Australia and southeast Asia.

Now a new study, published in Nature Climate Change, suggests that similar “extreme” El Niño events could become more frequent as global temperatures rise.

If global warming reaches 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – the aspirational limit of the Paris Agreement – extreme El Niño events could happen twice as often, the researchers find.

That means seeing an extreme El Niño on average every 10 years, rather every 20 years.

Extreme events

El Niño is a global weather phenomenon that originates in the Pacific Ocean. A weakening in the trade winds across the equatorial Pacific brings warm ocean temperatures to the eastern Pacific, off the coast of South America.

This has major impacts on rainfall patterns worldwide, explains study co-author Dr Wenju Cai from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia. He tells Carbon Brief:

“These movements cause a massive reorganisation of the atmosphere circulation, leading to extreme climate and weathers around the globe. For example, floods in Ecuador, Peru and southwest American, but drought in Indonesia and other western Pacific countries.”

While we might see an El Niño event every five years or so, every decade or two an “extreme” event arrives. As well as the 2015-16 event, some of the strongest El Niños in recent history include 1982-83 and 1997-98.

In the new study, the researchers define an “extreme” event by the size of the rainfall shift from the west Pacific over to the normally dry east Pacific.

Using a collection of 13 climate models, the researchers simulated the frequency of extreme El Niño events from a pre-industrial period of 1869-99 to the end of the 21st century.

Their simulations assume global emissions follow the RCP2.6 pathway. This is a “peak and decline” scenario where stringent mitigation and negative emissions technologies mean atmospheric CO2 concentration peaks and then falls during this century.

The models suggest that an extreme El Niño event in pre-industrial times would occur perhaps once every 22 years. As global temperatures rise, the frequency of extreme El Niños in the models then increases at a similar pace.

You can see this in the left-hand chart below, which shows global temperature rise (black line; left-hand axis) and the frequency of extreme El Niño events (purple line; right-hand axis). The two lines track closely together.

By the time warming reaches 1.5C above pre-industrial levels (see the green shaded strip), extreme El Niños occur about once every 10 years. That’s an increase of 130% over the pre-industrial frequency, the paper notes.

Uneven warming

Using a subset of five models, the researchers continued their simulations out to the middle of the 23rd century. They find that even after the temperature rise levels off, the frequency of extreme El Niño events keeps increasing.

You can see this in the right-hand chart above. As global temperatures (black line) decrease slowly after 2050, the frequency of extreme El Niño events (purple line) continues to rise. Beyond 2050, events increase to about one event every seven years, the paper says, eventually peaking at an event every five years by the early 22nd century.

This was an unexpected result, says Cai:

“Surprisingly, the frequency of extreme El Niño continues to increase for another century and by at least 40% after global mean temperature stabilises.”

It’s not until around 2150 that the frequency of extreme events starts to drop again.

This happens because the way that the Earth warms up is not uniform, says Cai, which makes it easier for the Pacific to switch into an El Niño state:

“Warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific is greater than the surrounding regions…making it easy to move convection and [the tropical] rainband to the eastern equatorial Pacific. After global mean temperatures stabilise, the faster warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific persists.”

La Niña

The study also analysed potential future changes in extreme events of El Niño’s cold water counterpart, La Niña.

During La Niña events the trade winds strengthen and the central and eastern Pacific Ocean becomes even colder than normal. La Niñas are known to bring drought to the southwestern US, floods to Central America and hurricanes to the Atlantic Ocean.

A previous study by many of the same authors found that if global carbon emissions aren’t curbed, extreme La Niña events could become more frequent in the 21st century – up from once every 23 years to once every 13 years.

However, the new study suggests that more frequent extreme La Niña events will be avoided if global temperature rise is limited to 1.5C or 2C.

Overall, the research “provides another example of why defining ‘dangerous’ climate change in terms of global mean temperature targets does not give the full picture”, says Prof Mat Collins, joint Met Office chair in climate change at the University of Exeter, who wasn’t involved in the study. In other words, the impacts of climate change are much more complicated than just how global average temperatures change.

But to be fully confident in the study’s findings, scientists need to overcome some issues with how models simulate ocean temperatures in tropical regions of the Pacific, says Collins:

“I still worry about problems with models in the tropical Pacific, whereby they tend to produce sea surface temperatures that are too cold in the present day. Ultimately, we need to significantly improve models and reduce systematic biases in order to test the robustness of results like this.”

52,52,FL-2017-000097-CHN,Authorities Ready for Tropical Storm 'Sonca' Flood Evacuations - The Cambodia Daily,https://english.cambodiadaily.com/news/authorities-ready-for-tropical-storm-sonca-flood-evacuations-132975/,"Severe weather belted the country’s coastal and highland provinces with more rain on Thursday, giving way to torrential floods that damaged provincial roads and led government authorities in four provinces to begin evacuations or prepare emergency shelters.

Preah Vihear, Oddar Meanchey, Kompong Thom and Kampot provinces have been hit hardest by Sonca, a tropical storm that has left a trail of destruction in its path. A 13-year-old boy and 35-year-old woman who drowned in floodwaters in Preah Vihear on Tuesday were among the first victims.

Provincial authorities say they are mounting their efforts and readying supplies to evacuate residents to safety should water levels continue to rise to dangerous levels.

“The authorities in Kompong Thom province are preparing to evacuate people because the water has risen to nearly reach warning level,” said Keo Vy, spokesman for the National Committee for Disaster Management.

The Stung Sen River rose to 13.4 meters on Thursday at a site in Kompong Thom, needing only 40 cm more to reach emergency levels, authorities said.

Waters in Preah Vihear, to the north, continued to rise and flow into Kompong Thom, Mr. Vy said. He warned that the flood levels were likely to be breached in the next few days.

The Water Resources Ministry has also issued a warning of strong winds and high waves in coastal areas, though it is forecasting only rain showers for most of the country today.

Oddar Meanchey provincial governor Sar Thavy said he had led military personnel and police officers into inundated areas throughout Trapaing Prasat and Anlong Veng districts on Thursday to inspect flooding and provide assistance.

The governor said water levels at the Tamok bridge usually only reach a depth of 2 meters, but had already risen to 3 meters.

Authorities have issued a flood warning and prepared “safety hills” where evacuees can find shelter along with food and supplies, he said.

The provincial authority “is using its total forces and speed boats to prepare evacuation of the people in case the areas become seriously flooded,” Mr. Thavy said.

In Preah Vihear province, 350 soldiers from the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces were deployed on Wednesday to aid relief efforts. Though authorities continue to work against the tide, provincial administration chief Muot Pisethanea said they were prepared to evacuate residents to safety should the rain continue to defy their attempts to buttress the Stung Sen’s riverbanks with sandbags.

Choam Ksan district governor Sear Kimseng said on Thursday that four communes had been flooded on Wednesday.

“The water is now receding for six communes, but two other communes are still seriously flooded and we are evacuating the people to the safety hills,” he said.

Global catastrophe risk modeller and analytics firm, RMS, announced recently that IRB Brasil RE has licensed the RMS® China Agricultural Model and RMS® India Agricultural Model, as the reinsurer looks to strengthen its position in the Asia-Pacific region.

The risk models will provide the reinsurer with a holistic view of exposures so that more accurate regional analytics can be produced, ultimately facilitating risk transfer.

Senior Director, Model Product Management, RMS, Laurent Marescot, said; “Today’s actuarial techniques to manage agriculture risk are increasingly challenging to use, whether that’s employing non-stationary trends in data and a limited historical loss record or keeping abreast of the changes in agriculture management practices and climate evolution.

“That today’s models must address a broader range of industry needs is key as we continue to expand our suite of RMS Asia-Pacific and global agricultural risk models to help enhance the risk management chain as a whole, from underwriting to portfolio management.”

RMS’ China solution can model all insurable products, which is more than 70 crops, and also forestry and livestock, explains RMS. With global companies looking to participate in China’s agricultural insurance sector, the model includes a vast database that provides the latest insurance terms and conditions, which can vary by location and business line.

The risk modeller’s India model provides greater understanding of more than 70 crop types in two seasons and is also compatible with the Indian government’s Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) scheme, introduced in 2016.

Head of Agriculture at IRB Brasil RE, Miguel Fonseca de Almeida, commented; “To better compete with reinsurers in the Asia-Pacific reinsurance market, it is crucial that we employ the most advanced and up-to-date modeling and analytics solutions. The RMS China and India Agricultural Models provide us with the necessary foundation to better understand and manage risk in our international agriculture portfolios and will enable us to maximize our global business profitability.”

For IRB Brasil RE, the models enable the company to gain a competitive edge in the Asia-Pacific region as it looks to expand its global agriculture portfolios, providing the reinsurer with the tools to participate in the Chinese and Indian agricultural insurance sectors.

Victor Roldán, Regional Head for Latin America at RMS, added; “The RMS China and India Agricultural Models are the first of their kind and will enable our clients in the Latin America region and around the world to take advantage of the significant growth opportunity presented by this segment.

“Empowered with the only China and India agricultural models that can offer umbrella and whole accounts in portfolio analyses, our clients will benefit from superior portfolio analytics capabilities to support better risk management practices.”","Mon, 24 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://149448277.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rms-logo.png,"['agriculture', 'china', 'rms', 'model', 'india', 'licenses', 'reinsurer', 'risk', 'global', 'irb', 'brasil', 'agricultural', 'models']",

Campi Flegrei, a name that aptly translates as ""burning fields"", is a supervolcano. It consists of a vast and complex network of underground chambers that formed hundreds of thousands of years ago, stretching from the outskirts of Naples to underneath the Mediterranean Sea. About half a million people live in Campi Flegrei's seven-mile-long caldera, which was formed by vast eruptions 200,000, 39,000, 35,000 and 12,000 years ago.

The past 500 years have been fairly peaceful ones for Campi Flegrei. There have been no eruptions at all since 1538, and that was a comparatively small event that resulted in the formation of the ""New Mountain"", Monte Nuovo. But recent events suggest that this period of quiescence may be coming to an end.

An acceleration of processes causing deformation and heating within the caldera saw the Italian government raise the volcano's threat level in December 2016. Fears are growing that magma deep inside Campi Flegrei could be reaching the ""critical degassing pressure"", where a sudden large-scale release of volcanic gases could abruptly inject heat into surrounding hydrothermal fluids and rocks. When this happens on a significant scale, it can cause catastrophic rock failure within the volcano, triggering an eruption. In line with this, a study published in May 2017 found evidence that the supervolcano has been building towards an eruption for decades.

But the difficult question is not if, but when, and just how big an event this would be.","Mon, 24 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/live/624x351/p0599vrv.jpg,"['formed', 'wipe', 'campi', 'naples', 'caldera', 'supervolcano', 'event', 'flegrei', 'eruptions', 'vast', 'eruption']",

At least eight people have died in the crisis so far, which Banerjee called “man-made”.

While the rain had slowed down on Tuesday, several areas faced further flooding after the DVC released more than 1.89 lakh cusecs of water from a number of its dams the next day, Hindustan Times reported. Banerjee had claimed that the corporation did not intimate her government before releasing the water, but the DVC claimed heavy rainfall in Jharkhand had forced them to do so.

“Every year farmers suffer crop losses because of the floods,” Banerjee said, according to ANI. “Houses are destroyed, cattle and animals have died. Property loss is massive. These are man-made floods.”

The Trinamool Congress chief said she had requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with whom she has consistently been at odds, to ensure that the DVC does not release any more water. “We have been asking the DVC to release water in smaller quantities so that the adverse effects here are minimised,” she said.

Banerjee held an administrative meeting on Thursday, where she surveyed the flood-affected areas in the state, including Amta, Khanakul and Joypur, reported News18. “Even today they [the DVC] have released more than 1 lakh cusecs of water,” she said. “The low-lying areas of Labhpur in Birbhum district, Purulia, Ghatal in West Medinipur and Goghat, Arambagh in Hooghly districts have been inundated.”

56,56,FL-2017-000097-CHN,Widespread flooding hits Cotabato City - Philippine Star,https://www.philstar.com/nation/2017/07/23/1720732/widespread-flooding-hits-cotabato-city,"COTABATO CITY, Philippines — Flooding has affected four more barangays in Cotabato City the past three days, affecting more residents whose needs officials are now helping provide.

Latest reports from the City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council indicated that 24 of the city’s 37 barangays are now flooded due to the continuous swelling of nearby rivers caused by heavy downpours in the mountains since last week.

Halima Satol-Ibrahim, city information officer, said on Sunday that, by July 21, the official count of flood-stricken residents rose to 18,684 families, or 91,537 individuals, from only more than 12,000 two days before.

City officials, led by Mayor Cynthia Guiani-Sayadi, toured the flooded barangays on Thursday for initial relief missions.

Satol-Ibrahim earlier said the city mayor’s office and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan might put the city under a state of calamity if flooding continues to spread.

Rivers straddling Cotabato City started to overflow more than week ago, inundating 20 barangays first and affecting more than 12,000 residents.

The city’s 37 barangays are crisscrossed by tributaries of the Rio Grande de Mindanao and many other large rivers that connect to the 220,000-hectare Liguasan Delta in the upper valley of central Mindanao.

The Liguasan Delta is a catch basin for rain-generated floodwaters from mountain ranges in North Cotabato, South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat and Bukidnon provinces.

The office of Guiani-Sayadi and the City Schools Division of the Department of Education are planning to hold special classes on higher ground for children from schools in flooded barangays.

Satol-Ibrahim said 10 city schools have been affected.

The city has also deployed health workers to attend to flood victims now afflicted by common ailments.

Affected barangay folk have urged the Mindanao Development Authority, whose main office is in Davao City, to focus on the immediate dredging of rivers here from accumulated silt.

The MINDA has a flood control and management program for central Mindanao, but people in the region have perennially been ranting about not seeing the agency address the problem.

Guiani-Sayadi on Friday called on residents in flood-prone areas here to help monitor the levels of rivers in their surroundings and to immediately evacuate if necessary.

“Forced evacuations will be imposed if the situation so requires,” Guiani-Sayadi said.","Sun, 23 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.philstar.com/images/the-philippine-star/headlines/20170723/flood-photo-1.jpg,"['flooding', 'schools', 'residents', 'office', 'rivers', 'guianisayadi', 'mindanao', 'cotabato', 'barangays', 'city', 'widespread', 'hits', 'flooded']", 
57,57,FL-2017-000097-CHN,Tunnel visions: China bets big on subways to handle massive population shift to cities - Hong Kong Free Press,https://hongkongfp.com/2017/07/23/tunnel-visions-china-bets-big-subways-handle-massive-population-shift-cities/,"Deep under Shanghai, workers on a flood-lit construction rig carefully install massive concrete wall sections for a new subway tunnel, adding metre-by-metre to the world’s longest metro system.

The Shanghai metro’s future Line 14 is part of plans to extend the already sprawling network another 35 percent by 2020 to 830 kilometres (515 miles) — more than the distance from New York to Chicago.

Yet Shanghai is just one player in an unprecedented subway-building boom as China’s massive cities race to keep pace with rising urban populations.

In 2001, four mainland Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai had rather limited networks. By end-2016 there were around 30, including some of the world’s longest and busiest networks, and about a dozen more cities have gotten the green light.

State media reports say Chinese spending on subway construction could top 2 trillion yuan ($295 billion) from 2016-2020 alone.

“(China is seeing) the fastest period in human history for the development of metro systems. It’s quite remarkable,” said Liu Daizong, a World Resources Institute transport expert in Beijing.

Legendary traffic jams

Usually reserved for first-tier cities, subways are running even in third-tier population centres far inland.

The driving factor is a massive shift of humanity to Chinese cities.

Only around 12 percent of Chinese were urban-dwellers in 1950. Today the rate is about 55 percent and targeted to rise by 2030 to 70 percent — or around one billion people.

Officially encouraged to lift millions from rural poverty and fuel economic growth, urbanisation has also brought congestion, pollution and sprawl.

Shanghai’s population has nearly doubled since 2000 to 24 million — China’s largest — and is on course for 30 million by 2030. Its traffic jams are legendary.

To keep up, its metro system has roughly doubled in the past decade, and on April 28 handled a record 11.86 million individual trips.

Along with Tokyo and Beijing, the network is among the world’s top three busiest and has grown so much that there are plans to connect it with the metro of the neighbouring city of Suzhou more than 100 km away.

Going deep

But challenges have emerged — new Shanghai lines must be dug as deep as a 15-storey building to squeeze under the maze of existing tunnels, said Zhou Xisheng, an engineer with state-run Shentong Metro Group which runs the system.

“As the depth increases, so does the difficulty… and the price,” Zhou said, standing in a yellow hardhat next to a giant pit during a government tour of new construction.

Metro construction is notoriously expensive, and questions hover over China’s ability to pay for all the plans.

But Lillian Li, a Shanghai-based credit expert with Moody’s, said ruling Communist Party support should see projects through.

“Transport is a key infrastructure sector that the government would like to support for (national) integration and coordination. That’s looking pretty good,” Li said.

Chen Xiaohong, a transportation engineering professor at Shanghai’s Tongji University, said China had no choice but to press ahead.

“Subways must be built to solve both present and future transportation problems. We cannot wait until roads get completely clogged and only then build a subway,” she said.

The building spree is part of larger visions sketched out by planners that include the development of massive “city clusters” such as one grouping Shanghai and nearby cities like Suzhou and Hangzhou that could top 50 million people.

Such urban agglomerations would connect to nearby lower-tier cities and other regions of China via fast-expanding high-speed rail systems, with economic benefits all around through enhanced flow of labour, financing, resources and administrative expertise, experts said.

A transport ministry statement on Tuesday declared China to be in a “golden era” of transport development.

The resulting bonanza of infrastructure investment, likewise, will boost the national objective of spurring domestic consumption to lessen China’s reliance on volatile overseas trade, said Zhu Dajian, a sustainable-development expert at Tongji University.

“Subways solve a lot of problems, raise the quality of a city, and reduce driving time and energy consumption,” he said.

“In 10 to 20 years this path will be proven correct.”","Sun, 23 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://i1.wp.com/hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/1024px-Jingan_Temple_Subway_Station.jpg?fit=1024%2C680&ssl=1,"['tunnel', 'china', 'handle', 'population', 'big', 'chinas', 'worlds', 'subway', 'cities', 'transport', 'subways', 'metro', 'shanghai', 'massive', 'visions', 'shift', 'chinese', 'million']",

BUJUMBURA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- One late afternoon in July, a burst of shouts of practicing Chinese martial arts (Wushu) came out from a primary school and could be heard on a crowded street in Bujumbura, capital of Burundi.

Over 30 Burundian youths wearing training clothes donated by the Chinese embassy in Burundi were doing Chinese martial arts in the school. They were led by Chinese teacher Zhang Xuguang, associate professor of the University of International Business and Economics of China.

Burundian Wushu Federation invited Zhang, who is also the director of Lide Martial Arts Research Center at the university, to Burundi to teach them Chinese martial arts. The training started from July 17 and will last for a month.

During the training, Zhang taught them the basics and actions of Wushu and taught them Tai Chi. Zhang planned to teach some of them a kind of traditional Chinese swordplay sometime to spread the Chinese swordplay in Burundi.

""Some of them are very good at Wushu, they practice Wushu with heart and soul,"" said Zhang, adding that their passion for Wushu is beyond his expectation.

In the training, Zhang consciously help the students to have better understanding of Wushu's connotation.

The head and the founder of Burundian Wushu Federation and Wushu Bujumbura Club Yves Nilrenganya said currently there are 12 Wushu clubs in Burundi, with more than 400 students. These clubs prepare for a national Wushu competition of Burundi each year since 2015, he said, adding that even the first year's competition attracted 2,000 people to watch.

Nilrenganya started learning Chinese Wushu since 2003 when he was a primary school student in Rwanda. His teacher is a Rwandan, who learned Wushu from a Chinese.

""I learned martial arts for protecting myself and for health. After learning Wushu, I also learned philosophy of peace and know how to live with others,"" he said.

In 2008, Nilrenganya returned to Burundi and started spreading Wushu in different areas of Burundi. In 2017, he created Burundian Wushu Federation with support from the Chinese embassy.

""Wushu is a very important game that every Burundi needs to know,"" he said. According to him, everyone in Burundi are very excited to see Chinese movies, which include very impressive movements, but people can only see them in film, so he came up with an idea to gather people to do martial arts.

Nilrenganya expected that one day he could represent Burundi to compete in Wushu with people from other countries.

Technician Issa Havyariuana, 28, is Nilrenganya's first student, who started learning Wushu in 2008.

Havyariuana said because of movies of Bruce Li, Wushu has become a favorite game in Burundi. ""I first learned Shaolin Wushu, then we started learning the new forms referring to international Wushu,"" he said.

""I want to be Bruce Li or Jet Li. Learning Wushu helps my technician work, I can do my job faster. I also know how to live with and respect others from Wushu.""

Some Burundian Wushu students can speak Chinese, including 27-year-old Ininahazwe Bonfils Ildephonse.

""I like kungfu, it's my hobby. It is also a kind of Chinese culture,"" Ildephonse, whose Chinese name is Li Zhixuan, told Xinhua in Chinese.

Besides Wushu, he also likes Chinese dancing very much, said Ildephonse, who learned Chinese language at Confucius Institute in Burundi.

""Chinese martial arts could help Burundian people understand Chinese culture and traditional Chinese philosophy. We hope to enrich culture exchanges between China and Burundi through exchanges of Wushu,"" Chinese Ambassador to Burundi Zhuo Ruisheng told Xinhua in an interview.","Fri, 28 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['xinhua', 'zhang', 'martial', 'training', 'arts', 'wushu', 'favored', 'burundian', 'started', 'feature', 'school', 'chinese', 'burundi']",

Laos accused of breaking CITES treaty to protect endangered species, China of encouraging live animal trade

By Adam Cruise The Guardian

Dozens of elephants from Laos are being illegally bought by China to be displayed in zoos and safari parks across the country, according to wildlife investigator and film-maker Karl Ammann.

According to Ammann, so-called captive elephants in Laos sell for about £23,000 before being walked across the border into China by handlers or “mahouts” near the border town of Boten. Thereafter they are transported to receiving facilities, which buy them from the agents for up to £230,000 per animal. “That is a nice mark-up,” says Ammann, “and makes it exactly the kind of commercial transaction which under CITES rules is not acceptable.”

Ammann and his crew stumbled on the illicit trade between Laos and China earlier this year, while investigating the sale of 16 Asian elephants from Laos to a safari park in Dubai. None of the elephants had the necessary permits for export. The translocation was stopped by a direct order from the new Laotian prime minister at the last moment, while an Emirates Airlines Cargo 747 was already on the tarmac in Vientiane, the country’s capital.

“We then looked into the background of these elephants and met with several of the owners of the elephants, as well as the local agent who arranged this sale,” explains Ammann. Delving deeper, he and his investigative team discovered that the trade in live elephants from Laos mainly involved China, with almost 100 animals ending up in Chinese zoos and facilities.

Many mahouts told Ammann on camera that their elephants are captive-bred but have been sired by a wild bull elephant. To avoid stud costs, mahouts in Laos tie captive-bred females to trees in the forest so that they can be mated with wild bulls. Under Cites Appendix I, an elephant with a wild parent in an uncontrolled setting is not considered captive-bred and therefore may not be sold commercially.

Almost 100 Asian elephants are believed to have been sold from Laos to China over the past couple of years. Chunmei Hu, an animal welfare advocate in China, says she has already established that six zoos — all government-owned — have a confirmed 38 elephants from Laos, with 50 more likely to be Laotian. But the trade in live Asian elephants contravenes international regulations. Like African elephants, Asian elephants are considered a species threatened with extinction. All international trade is prohibited by the Convention in the Trade of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) unless it is not for commercial purposes, or unless the elephants originate from a Cites-approved facility of captive-bred animals.

Laos does not have a single CITES-approved breeding facility, however, and, Ammann says, the transactions have been commercial. Some zoos have paid Chinese middlemen up to ten times as much as the latter paid owners in Laos.

Elephants are a popular and renumerative attraction at Chinese circuses, zoos, and safari parks — they are still expected to perform in some places, although this is increasingly controversial. Conditions can be poor — some reviewers on Tripadvisor describe elephants confined in small concrete boxes. The elephants are sourced from a number of places. In 2015, and again in 2016, amid a global outcry, Chinese zoos and safari parks flew in more than 60 baby African elephants taken from their families in the wild in Zimbabwe. The elephants are now at the Shanghai Wild Animal Park, the Beijing Wildlife Park, and the Hangzhou Safari Park, among other venues.

This would not be the first time Laos had breached CITES requirements. In July last year, the CITES secretariat highlighted “gaps in implementation under Article XIII of the convention” and recommended that Laos improve its compliance ability and law enforcement of illegal wild animal and plant trafficking.

One of the measures available to CITES is to recommend that wildlife trade is suspended with Laos, says John Scanlon, the CITES secretary general. But he adds that the measure is used only “as a last resort, as our primary goal is to work with and assist CITES parties in the effective implementation of the convention.”

A CITES technical committee is in Laos at the moment to verify the country’s progress. Scanlon adds: “Our comment on the alleged export of Asian elephants from Laos will entirely depend on the nature of the trade and details of the particular transaction.”

Ammann is sceptical that action will be taken. “The CITES secretariat should have recommended the suspension of Laos for non-compliance and lack of enforcement a long time ago,” he says, “but they are a UN body and rocking the boat is not in their nature, even though suspension is a vital enforcement tool at their disposition and re-admission is an option once compliance has been achieved.”

While Laos still has considerable distance to go in stopping the trade, Ammann believes that China also needs to be held accountable. “China has been on the front lines of importing iconic live species from rhino to killer whales, elephants, and recently 150 chimps — all totally illegal — and Article VIII of the convention dictates that parties involved in the illegal import be prosecuted, the animals in question confiscated and, if possible, repatriated. But this does not seem to apply to China,” he says.","Tue, 25 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2811/34036833526_af5be46623_z.jpg,"['china', 'wildlife', 'illegally', 'wild', 'elephants', 'sold', 'ammann', 'investigator', 'laotian', 'cites', 'zoos', 'dozens', 'laos', 'trade', 'chinese', 'safari']",

LUOYANG, China, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Skeet athlete Zhang Shan, 49, savored her Olympic crown in Barcelona on July 26th, 1992, and she got a silver medal at the Chinese National Games on the same day 25 years later.

In the Barcelona Olympic Games, Zhang got 223 of 225 targets to win the gold medal. More importantly, Zhang beat all the men athletes, as both men and women were then competing in the same event of skeet, which was the only one in history.

Zhang had a good shooting on Wednesday, as she got 73 of the 75 targets for the first place in the qualification round, then lost only one target to 28-year-old Wei Meng from Shandong province in the final.

""I'm satisfied with my performance today, it's very good for me in recent years,"" said Zhang who has been shooting for more than 30 years, and won the 1998 World Cup title as well as the team crown in the 2007 World Championships.

""It's not me to decide when I would retire, but the young athletes who would eliminate me and stop me from qualifying for the games some day,"" Zhang said.

""When I stand on the field, I must do my best, because I feel many young athlete are looking at me, and I want to be their model,"" Zhang added.

The 13th Chinese National Games will officially run from Aug. 27 to Sept. 8 in Tianjin, but trap and skeet shooting events were being held at Yiyang, a little county in central China's Henan province.","Wed, 26 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['xinhua', 'zhang', 'olympic', 'shan', 'province', 'games', 'champion', 'shooting', 'targets', 'young', 'eliminate', 'world', 'athletes', 'skeet']",

WINDHOEK, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese rice donated to the Namibian government is helping the country's citizens to meet their nutritional needs, following a dry spell and poor yields.

During the 2016 and 2017 harvest season, due to climate variability, Maria Matias from a far flung village in Namibia's Oshana region could not produce enough food from her farm to feed her family.

Following a poor harvest, she faced major challenges feeding her family.

""As a result of drought and subsequent flood, I had poor yields of pearl millet and other legumes. Further, I had no surplus yields that I could sell to earn money and buy supplementary food to add to our household food basket. It had been a struggle to make ends meet,"" said Matias.

Matias' story represents that of many Namibians in the norther region of the country.

As luck would have it for her, in mid-May this year, to her relief, the situation improved. Agents from the local Oshakati-west Constituency Office distributed Chinese rice to households in the local authority area.

To date, on sunny afternoons and breezy nights, Matias prepares the Chinese rice for her family. ""Chinese rice has become our daily meal. I had poor yields, hence the rice is supplementary or even a substitute meal of the stable pearl millet in northern Namibia which is in short supply,"" said Matias.

According to Matias, the texture of rice is not so different from the regular rice sold in Namibia. ""The advantage of the Chinese rice is that it does not require extensive cooking compared to other varieties we are accustomed to. As long as one soaks it in water, preparation period is minimal,"" she added.

Meanwhile, Kuku Agatus, a traditional leader in the Oshakati-West constituency said that the Chinese rice was distributed to households as directed by the Central Government as part of efforts to address food shortages resulting from the negative effects of climate change.

""In our area, should you randomly visit any homestead at lunch hour or dinner, they will be serving you Chinese rice. Chinese rice has helped our communities and its people to get by and meet the nutritional needs,"" he added.

In June, Li Nan, Charge d' Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Namibia, said that since 2016, to alleviate the drought disaster, the Chinese Government provided two batches of emergency food aid to Namibia, 4,000 tons and 2,600 tons of rice, totaling 100 million Namibian dollars(7.7 million U.S. dollars), benefitting more than 595,000 people.","Sun, 30 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['xinhua', 'needs', 'yields', 'namibian', 'namibia', 'rice', 'matias', 'food', 'meet', 'helps', 'tons', 'feature', 'poor', 'nutritional', 'chinese', 'households']",

But that’s only for two minutes or so, and only for the people who will be in the so-called “path of totality” that cuts across the US. In the time leading up to and following those few moments on August 21, and for everyone else in the US, there will be many more minutes of partial eclipse, which require specialized, ultra-dark glasses to see safely.

As August 21 nears, eclipse-chasers are realizing that if they want to see the sun disappear behind the moon, they can’t just wake up on the day of the astronomical event and step outside their homes. They’ll need solar eclipse glasses. And so, in the past few months, a cottage industry has sprung up to accommodate this market need. The problem is that many of these newly arrived sellers of solar eclipse glasses are fly-by-night manufacturers looking to turn a quick profit by selling subpar and potentially dangerous goods to unsuspecting Americans.

The first stop for most seeking a pair of eclipse glasses is likely to be Amazon, where there are literally thousands of listings for the devices, ranging in materials from cardboard to bronze. I, too, went on Amazon to scout out a pair. I picked more or less at random: I chose a cheap pack of 10 cardboard glasses with five different designs, at least two of which were not garishly jingoistic. About a week after I bought them, I had a thought: Maybe I should double-check to make sure they met safety standards set by the scientific community. Next stop: NASA.

NASA, of course, has a website dedicated to the 2017 eclipse, and on it, they have a section dedicated to eclipse-viewing safety. The site says that eclipse-viewing glasses must meet a few basic criteria:

Have ISO 12312-2 certification (that is, having been certified as passing a particular set of tests set forth by the International Organization of Standardization)

Have the manufacturer’s name and address printed somewhere on the product

Not be older than three years, or have scratched or wrinkled lenses

NASA also names a few trustworthy lens brands: “Our partner the American Astronomical Society has verified that these five manufacturers are making eclipse glasses and handheld solar viewers that meet the ISO 12312-2 international standard for such products: American Paper Optics, Baader Planetarium (AstroSolar Silver/Gold film only), Rainbow Symphony, Thousand Oaks Optical, and TSE 17.”

I checked the ones I’d bought. ISO 12312-2: check. Manufacturer: American Paper Optics. Did I happen to roll a seven, or were most of the products on Amazon safe by NASA standards? I decided to check.

With the help of a handful of other Quartz reporters, I went through the first 140 listings that show up when you search Amazon for “eclipse glasses.” (Note that because of Amazon’s algorithms, not all of us saw the exact same listings in the exact same order. However, we believe that, combined, these searches provide a pretty good picture of what the average Amazon user might see.) Our search results included 25 “Sponsored” listings, 10 “Best Sellers,” and one “Bill Nye Exclusive.” Only 16 claimed to use lenses manufactured by one of the NASA-approved companies. Four of the bestsellers and the Bill Nye Exclusives are listed as manufactured by American Paper Optics; none of the rest of the bestsellers, and none of the 25 sponsored listings, were made by a NASA-approved company. That doesn’t necessarily mean they’re unsafe—but it does raise questions about who exactly is making these devices, and whether they’re producing them with safety in mind.

Andrew Lunt says he predicted that huge demand for eclipse glasses would lead to some problem or another. His Tucson, Arizona-based business Lunt Solar Systems, through their sister company TSE17, sold eclipse glasses in Germany leading up to the solar eclipse there in 2015. “In Germany, people were rioting in the street because the government mandated people without glasses had to stay indoors,” Lunt recalls.

He says that two years ago, he tried to gin up concern about the possibility that unmet demand could lead to similar unrest, or create openings for opportunists to swoop in, when the 2017 eclipse made its path across the US. But no one was interested. “You only know if you’ve been through it,” he says.

NASA seems to be scrambling to deal with the growing eclipse-glasses market as well. “Everything was going along fine until the public started to wake up to the eclipse and started buying things that may or may not be safe,” says Rick Fienberg, an astronomist and press officer at the American Astronomical Society, who has helped lead the charge in verifying the safety of various eclipse glasses. “Now they are peppering us and NASA with questions.”

Every manufacturer Quartz talked to spoke of nearly unfathomable sales growth in recent weeks. “We are increasing [sales] by 30-40% a day, 400-500% per week,” says Lunt. His company’s projections suggest that in the week prior to the eclipse itself, it will sell in the ballpark of 7-8 million eclipse glasses.

But if you search for “eclipse glasses” on Amazon, Lunt’s TSE17 lenses don’t show up anywhere near the first 100 results. Those are filled, almost entirely, with sellers like Summstar, which sells HDMI splitters and lightbulbs alongside supposedly sun-safe glasses, and Habibee, which sells a bewildering mix of things like brightly colored plastic hairclips, nail polish, and men’s suspenders.

All of the NASA-approved manufacturers are specialists, making only lenses or astronomical gear. Most have also been in business for decades, and are well-known within the astronomy community and among eclipse-chasers. You can go to their websites and see where they source their parts, what companies did their certifications, and where you can find their factories. The Amazon sellers, on the other hand, typically sell a handful of random products—often recent fad items like fidget-spinners—and provide neither sourcing nor contact information.

“It’s all nonsense,” says Mark Margolis of Reseda, California-based, NASA-approved Rainbow Symphony. “There are a zillion companies putting out the same product and they all have different names. And this isn’t because I don’t want competition in the marketplace. We’re oversold and on backorder. It’s not my motive to keep competitors out of the market.”

Of the 140 Amazon listings reviewed by Quartz, 119 of 140 claimed to have the proper ISO certification. Some even say they are just as good as the NASA-approved manufacturers, but haven’t gotten approval yet.

Fienberg, of the American Astronomical Society, has been in contact with many companies not yet on the NASA-approved list. “My phone keeps ringing” with companies asking for the NASA stamp of approval, he says. “We started collecting additional paperwork and what do you know—some don’t have complete ISO paperwork.”

When this happens, Fienberg or others on his team will attempt to work with the company to figure out what’s missing and fill in the gaps. “Some of them are in the process of trying to fix it and others have stopped talking to us. It’s a moving target,” he says.

For example, Fienberg spoke to an American representative of one Chinese company, and asked for and received their certification papers. “I said it doesn’t pass muster, and told him to send it to the ICS labs”—one of the more well-known ISO accreditation labs in the US. “I haven’t heard anything since. That was about two weeks ago.”

As for the next item on NASA’s safety checklist—identifying the name of the lens manufacturer—of the 140 Amazon listings reviewed by Quartz, a total of 33 identified the name. American Paper Optics was named on 13 of these; the second-most common name was Solar Eclipse International, allegedly a Canadian lens manufacturer. Many of the others that list no name make a point to note that their lenses are manufactured in Canada as well. It’s unclear, though, whether Solar Eclipse International actually manufactures anything in Canada. The Toronto address on their website is for a residential high-rise building, and detailed questions to the company’s spokesperson went unanswered. The only response provided was:

Regarding the ISO qualification, the full testing report has 16 pages, and all details are listed inside. All of our products are quality ensured with CE certified under ISO 12312-2:2015 international standards. Our certification can be verified online, and you can contact the testing company at your needs.

NASA, too, is looking into Solar Eclipse International. “I have their samples,” says Fienberg. “I have their ISO certification and it is deficient. It is not complete.” Fienberg says that the documentation is missing a whole section on labeling and packaging. (Quartz also obtained the ISO certification documentation and confirmed Fienberg’s allegation. The certification was done by a Chinese company, at a Chinese factory, which adds evidence to the possibility that “Canadian-made” is not exactly accurate.) That in and of itself doesn’t mean the lenses are unsafe. But Fienberg sees it as a red flag that makes him question the certification as a whole: “You can’t say it’s certified to the ISO standard if it doesn’t pass all the tests in the ISO standards.”

Lunt, of TSE17, says he has been in talks with Amazon about keeping counterfeit glasses off the online marketplace. He’s been buying samples from Amazon sellers and testing them, both on whether their lenses are up to standard and whether they’re actually made by the company stamped on the product, to get a sense of the scope of the problem. Working with other manufacturers, like American Paper Optics (APO), who are ostensibly his competitors, Lunt’s found many counterfeits. APO in particular is being counterfeited “quite a lot,” he says—which might explain why nearly 10% of the Amazon listings Quartz sampled claimed to be APO.

APO itself has done the same. Jason Lewin, the company’s director of marketing, says APO started to notice the counterfeits showing up on Amazon about a month ago. Since then, they’ve ordered some of the products, tested them, and sent Amazon photos and documentation of the counterfeits. Both Lewin and APO president John Jerit have been frustrated by the lack of response. They’re late to the game with this,” says Jerit. “Some of the legitimate resellers we’ve got, they’ve been complaining and complaining about this.

“[Counterfeiting] isn’t new to Amazon but this isn’t fidget spinners,” adds Lewin. “These are supposed to be things to keep you safe.”

All this has made me suspicious about my own glasses. The ones I bought have all the right words printed on them: “meets the Transmission Requirements of ISO 12312-2” they say, before going on to list a slew of other standards allegedly met. Then at the end: “Mfg. by: American Paper Optics.”

But the Amazon listing didn’t actually say American Paper Optics manufactured the lenses; it just showed up with the Tennessee-based company’s stamp on it. I ask Lunt how I could tell if what I had was the real deal or a knock-off, and he tells me to look at the earpieces. There’s a design element that’s been generic among all of cardboard glasses for years (remember those red-and-blue lensed 3D glasses?): the part of the cardboard frame that hooks over the ears has a rounded end. APO recently changed their design to have a more squared-off earpiece.

No surprise, my 10-pack all have rounded ears, the scarlet letter of phoniness.

Fienberg says the AAS and NASA plan to release new information in the coming days approving additional manufacturers, and he continues to be overwhelmed by company requests for reviews. He also expects retail chains like Lowes and Walmart to soon begin selling eclipse glasses, and he plans to work closely with them on their approval process. “I’m going to list companies I know for sure are selling safe glasses and the way I know for sure is I’ve talked not just to them but the manufacturers that are supplying them,” says Fienberg. “We know they have been tested and we’ve handled them ourselves.”

In the meanwhile, here’s the real question: How much does it matter if you wind up with a pair of glasses that don’t meet NASA safety standards? “All the testing I’ve done have shown that the products are very bright but are not unsafe,” says Lunt. Tests done on a spectrophotometer—a lab-level machine that costs thousands, in case you were wondering if you could check your glasses yourself at home—show that the lenses are, in fact, blocking the most harmful spectra of light. “The IP is getting ripped off, but the good news is there are no long-term harmful effects,” says Lunt.

That said, in this sort of high-demand environment, it’s easy to imagine an unscrupulous dealer coming in and making no effort at all to create a safe product before listing it on Amazon. “Just today I got a call for someone looking for 125,000 glasses,” said Lunt on July 26. “When we start running out and we will, people will buy anything.”

On July 27, Amazon sent out a letter to sellers of eclipse glasses and products with an update to their policy: sellers will now have to submit for approval and provide details of safety and origin, including ISO certification from an accredited lab. But it remains unclear what will happen to those already on their marketplace. (Amazon did not respond to multiple queries from Quartz. We’ve reached out to them again for confirmation and will update this post if and when we hear back.)

“Hopefully what they’ve done—putting a policy in place—will do something,” says Lewin, of APO. “Anything will help. It will all come down to the next couple of weeks.”

Water levels have risen steadily since unrelenting monsoon rain began to lash the heart of the Southeast Asian country in early July, driving some people to higher land or seek shelter in Buddhist monasteries, a disaster relief official said.

“The situation is under control, but what happens now will depend on the weather,” Ko Ko Naing, director general of the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, told Reuters.

“We are prepared to support the flood-hit areas because flooding happens every year.”

The government has provided food and other assistance to a total of 116,817 displaced people by Monday, as well as longer-term shelter for those outside settlements where flood waters are not expected to subside immediately, he said.

One man drowned in the floods in the Sagaing region and another was swept away while crossing a stream in Chin State, said a resettlement official in the ministry, Kay Thwe Win.

On Saturday, images of the Buddha’s footprint that draw pilgrims to a pagoda in Magwe Division were submerged by the rising waters, although no damage was immediately apparent, the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported.

A small dam also collapsed in Pegu Division on Saturday, it said.

Video provided to Reuters by a Buddhist monk near Pakokku, 520 km (323 miles) north of the commercial hub of Rangoon, showed a gold-leaf-covered pagoda slipping into the raging waters of the Irrawaddy River on Thursday.

The abbot at the pagoda, U Pyinnya Linkkara, said flooding was common in the area during the monsoon that runs from May to October, but this year’s floods caused alarming erosion.

Some riverside villages have been washed away entirely, he said.

“The villagers are now scared to live here,” he said. “The flooding has now decreased, but erosion continues.”","Mon, 24 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.dvb.nohttp://english.dvb.no/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/flood-1024x731.jpg,"['flooding', 'waters', 'shelter', 'state', 'floods', 'burma', '100000', 'away', 'buddhist', 'saidthe', 'pagoda', 'resettlement', 'displaced', 'killed', 'washed']",

In one, he mocked Senate investigators by offering 11-year-old-son, Barron, to speak now that son-in-law Jared Kushner is finished.

“Jared Kushner did very well yesterday in proving he did not collude with the Russians,” Trump wrote. “Witch Hunt. Next up, 11 year old Barron Trump!”

Kushner spoke to Senate investigators on Monday and it appears Trump is pleased with the outcome.

Trump started his Twitter rant by claiming there were “Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign” in favor of Hillary Clinton. The president also mocked his own Attorney General, writing, “Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!”

Once he was finished ripping the “witch hunt” Russia investigation and slamming his own Attorney General, the president moved on to messages about Obamacare.

“ObamaCare is torturing the American People.The Democrats have fooled the people long enough. Repeal or Repeal & Replace! I have pen in hand,” Trump wrote. “Big day for HealthCare. After 7 years of talking, we will soon see whether or not Republicans are willing to step up to the plate!”

Trump also tweeted an uncustomary presidential message on Tuesday, welcoming Senator John McCain back to work after he was recently diagnosed with brain cancer.

“So great that John McCain is coming back to vote. Brave – American hero! Thank you John,” Trump wrote.

iGO.live is one of them and tonight it’s pulling out all the stops to try to make that happen with a night of music, celebrities, and tech.

Girl group Fifth Harmony will take to the stage in Beverly Hills LA, alongside celebrities and socialites such as Blac Chyna, Tyga, Bella Thorne, Ashley Benson, and Hailey Baldwin who will live stream their view of the event via the iGO.live app.

Combined the attendees have an Instagram following of more than 69m. And iGO.live is hoping the launch party will attract some of those followers to the service.

The digital world dictates our experiences and soon it could dictate our salaries. Until now, the only real benefit was to show off, but iGO.live wants to change this by monetising social sharing.

After all, if we don’t share something on Facebook or Snapchat Story, did it even really happen?

What does iGO.live do?

Putting a Snapchat-like spin on Periscope, people use augmented reality to customise their streams with effects from virtual accessories to hand gesture triggered visuals.

Fans can then show their appreciation through the app’s gifting feature. Using in-app currency to buy animated gifts — such as flying pigs and love trains — which flood the screen with a sensory overload of sounds and visuals.

It offers an insight into how celebrities live, allowing you to view, discuss and interact with them in real time.

Can anyone now make their life their job?

“This app can change your life”, boasts a billboard overlooking Sunset Boulevard in LA.

It’s a bold claim but some of iGO.live’s most popular hosts prove that it can happen.

Since it launched, the app has racked up users in China and Russia, with some streamers attracting 100,000 people at a single time.

Loyal fans flood the app’s most popular users with gifts. Streamers are then able to convert gifts into cash.

While the app’s current user base isn’t quite big enough to generate its streamers a large enough income to quit their day jobs, it does offer a great additional revenue stream.

Those that have hit the 100,000 viewer mark are earning sums in the hundreds after just a few months.

Given the success of early adopters on other services, such as Instagram and YouTube — with many popular figures now earning a living from them — it is understandable why celebrity hopefuls are rushing to join the latest social service.

iGO.live has big plans and if everything goes as expected, iGO.live celebrities could soon be a thing.

To view the event, download iGO.live on either the App Store or Google Play in time to watch at 3am London time.","Wed, 26 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.verdict.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pexels-photo-492930.jpeg,"['gifts', 'celebrities', 'life', 'view', 'apps', 'popular', 'app', 'wants', 'igolive', 'live', 'monetise', 'streamers']",

MARBLE FALLS — Faith Academy of Marble Falls athletes don’t have to go looking for a place to get their workouts in anymore since the school opened a 4,600-square-foot facility on its campus.

And coaches aren’t waiting for the school year to begin to put the weight room to use.

Strength-and-conditioning coach Lloyd Joubert has already been putting athletes through a strenuous program.

The weight room is only part of the new facility. It also houses locker and storage rooms

Head football coach Pete Rhoades and new defensive coordinator Jared Garza have been cleaning and touching up the rooms.

“We want kids to be proud (of the facility),” Rhoades said. “We’re trying to get this place cleaned up to make it so kids want to come here.”

While the locker and storage rooms are getting prepared for the upcoming football season, coaches spent a lot of time organizing the weight room.

The room has three power racks for squats, two multi-station racks, two benches, leg extension and leg curl machines, shoulder and rowing machines, a jammer machine that helps players explode out of their stances, and a Smith machine for lean proper squats.

Power clean mats complete with the school’s logo will arrive in a few days.

Much of the weight equipment was donated from a Corpus Christi school that received new equipment.

“We cleaned it up and painted it,” Rhoades said.

Rhoades, who was announced as the Flames head football coach May 3, is the academy’s fourth head football coach in four years. His goal is to build a program beginning with the facilities.

Rhoades has been a defensive coordinator and spent much of his career on that side of the ball while working at Llano, Bastrop, and Cameron Yoe high schools and St. Michael’s Catholic Academy in Austin.

Look for the Flames to try to control the clock and keep scoring low this season.

“We want to shorten the game and play great defense,” Rhoades said.

A Leeds-based brand management company that specialises in sports has partnered with a Chinese marketing agency to build the brand of a Guangzhou-based football club.

Works ltd has partnered with Oceans Sports & Entertainment to strengthen the international brand of Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao FC as football in China becomes increasingly popular.

Works is a global sports design specialist having worked on branding for the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups and eight of the last 14 Champions League finals.

The club is recognised as an innovative outfit in the Chinese Super League and Works was hired to redevelop the club’s existing logo as well as developing secondary brand assets, brand guidelines, style guides and redesigning club’s mascot and introducing a new female mascot.

Oceans Sports & Entertainment is based in Beijing and Shanghai and has established relationships with football clubs across China and Asia.

Shoto Zhu, chief executive of Oceans Sports & Entertainment, said: ""Oceans required a partner with a strong track record in sports brand design.

""The project with Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao FC is an important part of our work for Chinese football and we are delighted to be partnering with Works""

Dallas mayor proposes new public-private partnership to build Trinity River Park

Next week, officials will brief the City Council on a plan to create a ""local government corporation"" to take on the Trinity River park project.

The public-private partnership would be responsible for working out the details of planning and building the new park, which would span 200 acres between the Margaret McDermott Bridge and the Ron Kirk Bridge.

But the move would also mean the park planning would be removed from City Hall. And that's sure to raise some hackles of the mayor's critics who are still smarting from his attempt to hand over Fair Park's operations to a nonprofit.

Rawlings said a local government corporation is needed to take the politics out of the road and keep the park from getting bogged down in bureaucracy.

Texas’ rural schools need help attracting teachers, and it’s all about the pay

In rural districts across Texas, the struggle to attract and keep teachers is only getting more difficult.

Lawmakers in Austin are debating teacher pay and school finance during the special session. Superintendents from rural districts say lawmakers have a chance to help them out by sending more money their way.

While getting teachers to leave big-city amenities for the more isolated country life has long been a challenge, school leaders say it's now tougher than ever.

Teacher turnover for those districts as a whole isn't significantly higher than it is statewide. But data suggests that's because experienced teachers who've made a home in those areas stay a long time even as new talent is difficult to attract and keep.

Trump to announce phone maker Foxconn's plans to build plant in Paul Ryan's district, not Texas

An invitation to President Donald Trump's afternoon news conference with Wisconsin officials says electronics giant Foxconn will build a liquid-crystal display panel plant in Wisconsin.

The Associated Press obtained the invitation from a person with knowledge of the Wednesday afternoon event at the White House. The person doesn't have authorization to publicly release the information.

White House spokesman Josh Raffel confirms the Trump announcement would be on Foxconn, but he wouldn't release details ahead of the event.

After national intrigue and diminishing hope, 4-year-old Luke Swofford of Rockwall was again clutching his teddy bear — named Teddy Bear — Wednesday morning. The pair were separated last week at Dallas Love Field after Luke returned with his grandparents from a trip to Colorado.

In the end, it turned out Teddy hadn't wandered far. Ian Fryers, a security compliance officer, found the worn stuffed bear in an airport breakroom after consulting surveillance footage.

Finally

Yu Darvish toes the rubber against the Miami Marlins tonight in Arlington, his final start before Monday's trade deadline, and a large crowd of evaluators is expected to be on hand, SportsDay's Evan Grant reported Tuesday.

Will it be his final start as a Texas Ranger? Maybe.

The Rangers have started to notify more teams that they are willing to discuss potential trades for their veteran players, a major league source told Grant on Tuesday, and while that is not a dramatic change from the club's posture over the past 11 days, it could pave the way for Darvish to be dealt.

And if Darvish is to be shipped off, there at 10 teams that can be ruled out as a destination, according to Fox Sports' Ken Rosenthal.

ATLANTA — Coca-Cola announced Wednesday the company will relaunch Coke Zero as Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in the U.S.

The new zero-calorie soda will have a red label and will have an “even better-tasting recipe.”

“It is a reinvention of Coke Zero,” CEO James Quincey said on Wednesday’s earnings conference call.

“It is part of what we call the one-brand strategy. It’s less switching between brands, which will ultimately help us keep and attract more consumers.”

As for the changing recipe, Coca-Cola said consumer testing of the new recipe was conducted for more than a year.

Coke Zero launched in 2005 as a rival to Diet Coke, which has decreased in popularity over the past 10 years.

Coke Zero Sugar is expected to launch in the U.S. in August, according to MSNBC. The soda has been introduced in Great Britain, Mexico and 25 other markets across the globe.","Wed, 26 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://kdvr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/07/screen-shot-2017-07-26-at-12-37-04-pm.jpg?w=1280,"['yearscoke', 'recipe', 'coke', 'zero', 'hello', 'yearcoke', 'goodbye', 'soda', 'zerocalorie', 'cocacola', 'article', 'sugar']", 
84,84,FL-2017-000097-CHN,‘Snowfall’: FX’s Crack-Era Drama Falls Between a Rock and a Hard Place - RollingStone.com,https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/snowfall-fxs-crack-era-drama-falls-between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place-196411/,"In the new FX drama Snowfall, it’s the summer of 1983 in South Central L.A.: palm trees, fire hydrants, boomboxes and the friendly neighborhood weed dealer. There’s a kid named Franklin Saint – he went to a preppie boarding school in the Valley, but instead of moving on to college, he’s drifted back to his old mean streets, working nights at a convenience store. By day, he sells pot to the local kids who dance while their radios blast “Jam on It.” Across the country, a rap crew from Queens called Run-D.M.C. are about to make history with a 12-inch called “It’s Like That,” talking tough about ghetto life and asking, “What ever happened to unity?” Franklin has dreams and ideals. He hopes selling drugs is his ticket to freedom. He has no idea – none of these people do – that a drug called crack cocaine is about to hit L.A. Life as they know it is over. It’s like that – and that’s the way it is.

In the style of The Wire or Traffic, this topical ensemble drama – created by Boyz n the Hood director John Singleton – chronicles the rise of crack with a few overlapping crime stories. In addition to Franklin, there’s Gustavo “El Oso” Zapata, a Mexican wrestler who falls in with the mob when he finds himself washed up in the luchador racket. At first he’s just collecting debts, but then he meets Lucia, the daughter of a Mexican family cartel with plans to change the drug game. There’s also Teddy, a disgraced CIA agent looking for a chance to redeem himself with the agency. He gets in on the Reagan Administration’s new secret plan: an illegal (and off-the-books) scheme to fund terrorism in Nicaragua, where the CIA wants to overthrow the Sandinista government. To raise funds for this covert war, a new kind of drug is about to flood the market. None of these people have seen Al Pacino in Scarface yet – it doesn’t open in theaters until December 1983. But they’re already living it out.

Snowfall moves fast through these tangled stories, with a real sense of the human pain at the center of it; the show works emotionally even when it reaches too far for the story to make sense. English newcomer Damson Idris is excellent as Franklin, the confused kid who doesn’t know what he wants. It’s not a subtle or slow-burning story: Singleton names this dealer Franklin Saint (!); the first time we see him, he’s telling neighborhood kids that crime doesn’t pay and making them give back what they stole from the ice cream man. Then, practically overnight, he meets a vicious Israeli gangster and offers to take over his coke-dealing operation in the hood.

Singleton has always been into broad strokes – see his remake of Shaft, where the Nazi cop is named Luger, or Poetic Justice, starring Janet Jackson as a girl named Justice who writes poetry. And given that it’s the early 1980s, there’s plenty of druggy music – when the soundtrack switches to the Fixx’s “One Thing Leads You Another,” you can practically see the bodies onscreen twitch with the cocaine jitters.

And for all the interlocking stories, Snowfall works best when it focuses on Franklin and his family. He lives with his mama Cissy, who works for a local slumlord; her job is ejecting black families who get behind on the rent. When Franklin hears her report to her boss, he snickers, “I was thinking about how good your white phone voice got.” When the twentysomething was in prep school, he made friends with rich white kids from the Valley; now he’s delivering weed to their mansions. The girl Franklin likes – she’s such a sweet girl-next-door type that she actually lives next door – shows up at the convenience store to grab a bottle of Boone’s Farm and a pack of Pop Rocks. (This was the year that the candy got pulled from shelves after false rumors it could make your stomach blow up in combination with soda – a clever crack metaphor in itself, especially with the slogan, “Taste the Explosion!”) But Franklin is about to get mixed up in selling a different kind of Pop Rocks, a drug that’s faster and deadlier than anything he could imagine. He doesn’t realize yet – but the crime world will never be the same. And neither will anything else.","Tue, 25 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/snowfall-ep102_sc102a-rm_0325-copy-83e9b1f1-da4d-4a57-9973-8db5d5948baf.jpg,"['drug', 'rob', 'snowfall', 'era', 'recreates', 'crack', 'works', 'named', 'fxs', 'theres', 'doesnt', 'crime', 'drama', 'hes', 'kids', 'franklin', 'sheffield']",
