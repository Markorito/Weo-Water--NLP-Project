Heaviest rain in 60 years overwhelmed Beijing's water system

Chinese authorities have more than doubled the official death toll from last weekend's flooding that swamped highways, homes and farms across the capital.

Officials from the Beijing flood control headquarters said late Thursday that 77 people died in the downpour, the worst in 60 years, up from the initial toll of 37 deaths announced Sunday, according to state news agency Xinhua.

The 66 victims who have been identified included five who were killed while carrying out rescue efforts, spokesman Pan Anjun said. Eleven bodies remained unidentified, he added.

Pan said a further sharp increase in the death toll was not likely because the search for missing people was winding down. He blamed the delay in updating the death toll on the time it took to recover the bodies and identify them.

The bodies of 38 people were found in the southwestern Beijing district of Fangshan, Xinhua reported, the area hardest hit by the floods.

On Wednesday, the district's chief issued a public apology to the 800,000 people affected by the floods in the area.

""We moved 65,000 people to the highlands. But there were still many flushed away by the flood. As the district chief, I should apologize to my fellow citizens,"" Qi Hong said in a news conference broadcast on state-run CCTV.

Qi conceded that the flooding exposed problems with the city's infrastructure.

""We learned from this rainstorm that the city infrastructure, especially the drainage system, needs to be improved,"" he said.

Around 170,000 farm animals were killed when floodwater covered 5,000 hectares of farmland, causing economic losses of 6.1 billion yuan ($955 million), Xinhua reported, citing a statement from the Fangshan district government.

Of the 66,000 homes that were damaged, more than 8,000 were demolished, the statement said. About 50 bridges and around 750 kilometers (466 miles) of road also have been wrecked, it added.

Chinese Vice Premier Hui Liangyu stressed Wednesday the need for more disaster relief efforts.

""We are now at a critical period for flood control, and every region and government department must attach more attention to combating floods and providing disaster relief,"" Hui said, according to Xinhua.

In the days following the deluge, Chinese micro-bloggers unleashed a torrent of criticism over the authorities' handling of the floods. They said they received little warning of the flood risk and questioned why the city's water system was unable to cope.

The Beijing-based media group, Caixin wrote: ""Why is this happening once and again? Year after year Beijing faces the same challenge, not even hosting the Olympics can provide a solution. That's how vulnerable our capital city can be.""

Another user, chuntiangushi, wrote: ""We can host the most luxurious Olympics and send satellites into space but can never seem to fix this drainage system. What a shame.""

On Wednesday, it appeared that the disaster may have claimed the jobs of two of the city's most senior officials. However, neither resignation of the Beijing mayor or vice mayor were officially linked to the flood response.

Observers said the resignations could be part of routine leadership reshuffle. Media reports said the city's legislature is now in session and its agenda includes appointments and dismissals.","Fri, 27 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg,"['death', 'flood', 'fangshan', 'doubles', 'district', 'watch', 'toll', 'water', 'citys', 'watched', 'beijing', 'china']",

By Sunday, Pan Anjun, deputy chief of the Beijing flood control headquarters, had tallied the damage. The Chinese newswire Xinhua reported that at least 37 people had died in storm-related damage or events, including 25 who drowned, 6 who were trapped in collapsing buildings, 5 who were electrocuted by fallen power lines, and 1 who was struck by lightning.

Some 500 flights into or out of Beijing Capital Airport were canceled. Reportedly 736 homes were flooded, and 66,000 residents in the hardest-hit areas had been temporarily located, many from the suburban district of Fangshan. At least 31 roads or bridges had collapsed.

All told, Mr. Pan estimated 2 million people were affected. And many of those have taken to online forums to express anger over what they see as ongoing lack of concern for proper construction amid Beijing's pell-mell growth – as well as for people's needs amid the storm.

On Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social media site, some residents suggested that China’s Meteorological Bureau should have alerted Beijingers to potential dangers through text messages sent via China’s giant state-run telecoms, China Mobile and China Unicom. Of greater Beijing’s roughly 20 million people, roughly 95 percent have cellphones.

The impact of the unusual storm was exacerbated by problems in the municipal drainage system. Beijing’s total urban area has doubled in a decade, from about 700 square kilometers (270 sq. mi.) in 2000 to almost 1,400 square kilometers (500 sq. mi.) in 2010. Many of the city’s newer drains are built to absorb up to 45 millimeters (1.7 inches) of rain per hour, but at several points the volume of Saturday’s storm was much greater.

“When the city hosts big conferences, there are guards at every bridge. But when the big rain comes, there are none,” wrote Dong Lu, the popular sports anchor and commentator.

“We hosted the Asian Games and Olympic Games,” wrote someone on Weibo going by the name Wen. “We spent billions of yuan to do monumental things. But now after after the heavy rains, we discover that we don't know how to build sewers.”

And as another concluded: “The secret of Qingdao, a [coastal] city that not afraid of floods? Its drains were built by Germany.”

Pan, the flood control official, estimated the total cost of damages to be about 10 billion renminbi, or $1.6 billion. More than 13,000 vehicle insurance claims have already poured into the China Insurance Regulatory Commission’s Beijing branch.

2,2,FL-2012-000121-CHN,Three Gorges Dam safe despite flood crest |Society |chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-07/25/content_15614512.htm,"The Three Gorges Dam experienced a flood crest, the largest since it began storing water, between Tuesday night and early Wednesday, but flood control authorities promised the dam was safe.

The dam, the world's largest hydropower project, saw its biggest flood this year as water from the Yangtze River's upper reaches gushed at 71,200 cubic meters per second into the dam's reservoir at 8 pm on Tuesday, raising the water level to nearly 160 meters, according to China Three Gorges Corp.

The peak water level in the dam's reservoir increased from 157.34 meters at 2 pm, when water flow through it reached 70,000 cu m per second, it said.

In a major effort to reduce flooding on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, water was released at a rate of 43,000 cu m per second on Tuesday afternoon, it said.

The dam began to store water in 2003, when the maximum water level in its reservoir was 135 meters, and it became fully operational in 2010, when the maximum level increased to 175 meters.

In 2010, a great flood hit the Three Gorges Dam, raising the water level in the reservoir to 161.01 meters, according to the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Water Resources Commission.

The current flood crest represents the biggest challenge the dam has faced, but it poses no threat to the safety of the dam, Zhao Yunfa, deputy director of the China Three Gorges Corp's cascade dispatch center, told China Daily.

""In preparation for the surging flows of water, the dam has increased its water release from 38,000 cu m per second to 43,000 cu m per second since Saturday, leaving sufficient room to store water,"" he said.

Boat traffic in the area has been suspended. All of the Three Gorges' ship locks were closed on Monday night, forcing more than 700 vessels to drop anchor, the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Water Resources Commission said at a news conference on Tuesday.

The latest flood crest came after heavy rains hit upstream areas of the Yangtze River beginning on Friday.

Steady rains caused water levels in several rivers in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to exceed warning levels, and the Cuntan section witnessed the most flooding since 1981, the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters said on Tuesday.

By Tuesday, downpours had forced the evacuation of about 216,000 residents in Sichuan and Chongqing, it said.

The flood peak hit 11 districts of Southwest China's Chongqing municipality on Tuesday, causing a direct economic loss of 710 million yuan ($111 million), according to a statement from the municipal flood control and drought relief headquarters.

The flood peak is the largest experienced by the main urban area of the municipality since 1981, according to the flood control authority.

The flood submerged riverside roads and restaurants in the municipality's Yuzhong district, which is located close to the downtown area.

Although authorities issued alerts to local residents and business owners before the flood, the flood peak still caught many off guard.

""It has been many years since the water rose this high,"" said Zeng Kaicheng, who runs an automobile-repair plant beside the Yangtze River in the Yuzhong district.

Zeng said authorities alerted him in advance, but he thought the floodwater would not affect him.

By around 8 pm on Monday, Zeng realized the flood was larger than normal, but it was already too late. He loaded some household appliances into his car and left. By 9 pm, floodwaters had submerged his plant.

The sidewalks along the river in Yuzhong district were packed with desks, chairs and cooking utensils from riverside hotpot restaurants, the roofs of which were barely visible.

On Tuesday, tens of thousands of people flocked to Chaotianmen Square, where the Yangtze River and the Jialing River converge, for a view of the flood peak in the Yangtze River.

When torrential rains resulted in widespread flooding in Beijing this past weekend, it was a relatively new technology, micro-blogging, that helped mitigate the damage from the failure of an ancient, sometimes under-appreciated, tech – sewers.

The rain was unrelenting in China’s capital on Saturday, with the government declaring it the worst storm in more than 60 years. Beijing, notorious for having poor drainage, saw its sewers quickly overwhelmed as water levels rose.

According to The Wall Street Journal’s China Real Time, at least 37 people died and almost 70,000 residents were evacuated as a result of the storm.

Fangshan, a district southwest of the city proper, is believed to have suffered the worst from the catastrophe. The devastation can be seen in fly-by footage from a CCTV newscast posted online (via Bill Bishop of Sinocism).





Residents took to Weibo as the situation unfolded. FutureGov Asia-Pacific reports that over 8.8 million Weibo messages about the flooding were sent out over a 24 hour period. Some users turned to the service for help after phones went down. According to the report, 100 students were rescued from a school by the Fire Bureau after an alert was sent out on Weibo.

“Similar messages from Weibo have given the authorities information which led to the rescue of more than 400 people in the same district,” author Jianggan Li wrote.

Meanwhile, concerned citizens came together on Weibo to organize rides and share lost and found information. FutureGov noted that 520,000 messages about picking stranded individuals up were recorded by Sina.com over the weekend.

Official departments also recognized the benefit of the service. The Fire Bureau and other city agencies, such as the Weather Bureau, Traffic Bureau and Water Authority, used Weibo to notify citizens of developments over the weekend.

Weibo vs. the Sewer

However, Weibo wasn’t just for altruistic purposes. Plenty of disgruntled residents took to Sina Weibo to complain about the situation. The Journal linked to one message with photos comparing sewer systems in Paris, Tokyo and Rome that was reposted almost 1,000 times.

“Sewers are not a face-giving infrastructure project,” the publication noted artist Li Yijia as having commented in response to the photos. In other words, politicians may be more prone to building more visible and noteworthy improvements such as high-rises and parks than decidedly less-glamorous sewers.

Even as cleanup and restoration is underway, Chinese netizens have been vocal on Weibo. Twitter user @MissXQ pointed out on Monday that Weibo users were “pissed” that police had already begun ticketing stranded cars. Still other citizens were reportedly upset that official media outlets had compared the disaster to Hurricane Katrina and claimed that Beijing was doing a better job handling its crisis.

As a technology, sewers have about a 6,000 year head start on micro-blogging. SewerHistory.org (never knew such a site existed!) traces the earliest known instance of a drainage system to 4,000 BCE Babylonia.

By comparison, micro-blogging dates back to around 2005, roughly about a year before Twitter was born. Sina Weibo wasn’t the first micro-blogging service in China, but it has quickly become the most-popular since it turned on in 2009. The word “weibo” means micro-blog in Chinese and is generally associated with Sina’s service, despite the fact that rivals like Tencent and Sohu operate competing Weibo platforms.

Of course, Beijing isn’t the first city to put social media to work in saving lives, or even effecting social change, as evidenced by Twitter’s role in last year’s Arab Spring, but it is in a unique position to lead a move toward social-based emergency services. China is the world’s fastest growing smartphone market, according to data from Flurry Analytics released earlier this year, and it still has plenty of room for growth.

The China Internet Network Information Center claimed that the number of Internet users in the country has grown to 538 million, up 11 percent from last year. Though cost will undoubtedly be an obstacle to increased Internet penetration, which is estimated to have hit nearly 40 percent in June, one recent study expects 80 percent of Chinese households will be able to afford smartphones by 2017.

It’s too early to tell for sure, but the collective accountability of the Weibo community may have a positive impact in improving Beijing’s sewer system. Functioning gutters might not have the same kind of ring as revolution, but they could still save lives the next time a storm like this comes through here.

Chinese journalists are questioning government propaganda due to conflicting reports of the death toll following Saturday’s devastating flooding in Beijing. Like the Wenzhou train crash and the Sichuan earthquake, the tragedy has galvanized mainstream and online journalists–and the official narrative is crumbling under their scrutiny.

A report from The Associated Press today offers a fascinating glimpse of an empowered press corps:

The Changjiang Daily newspaper reported online that Beijing city officials at a news conference late Wednesday were swarmed afterward by reporters trying to get additional comments. It said one journalist with the official broadcaster China Central Television asked spokesmen why they didn’t give the new death toll when she could see from the paper in their hands that the toll was 61 dead including five civil servants. The officials left quickly without responding, the report said. The journalist wasn’t identified by name in the report. By Thursday afternoon the report had been deleted.

Readers would be forgiven for doubting this took place in China: Reporters “swarming” a news conference in the wake of a natural disaster? A state broadcast journalist challenging official figures? It’s a description of a healthy, demanding watchdog press–at least until we learn the article describing it has been censored.

In a news alert this week, CPJ likened Beijing’s flooding crisis to the Wenzhou train crash which took place a year ago Monday. Propaganda officials then exhorted journalists to “emphasize miracles” in the rescue effort, and avoid questioning the causes–just as they did this week. Compare our description of the media’s response to the Wenzhou disaster with the AP excerpt above:

Journalists chased Ministry of Railways spokesman Wang Yongping and demanded a press conference. A propaganda “miracle,” in the form of a 2-year-old rescued after survival was declared impossible, became a focal point of the encounter. Online accounts said a rescue worker defied orders in order to save her, casting the official search in a less flattering light. Asked for comment, Wang could only repeat that her discovery was miraculous. “It was not a miracle,” one reporter yelled back.

It’s heartening that this kind of pushback is becoming more routine.

The change, in large part, is due to the Internet. With microblog users exchanging information and reactions at high speed, many users are becoming media critics, pouncing on compliant news outlets for failing to hold officials accountable. In the wake of the Wenzhou crash, we reported, “Internet commentators were furious that state mouthpiece People’s Daily and three other newspapers ran coverage of a military ceremony on front pages the day after the accident.” Now look at the headline that six state newspapers chose to run this past Sunday, the day after the worst of the floods, as reported by the Berkeley-based China Digital Times: “The Whole Party and the People of Every Nationality in the Country Unite with Speed and Force, Forging Valiantly Down the Mighty Path of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics.”

Journalists on the ground, and citizen microblog users, have learned from Wenzhou. They are talking back, sharing data, and have already defined Saturday’s tragedy with a poignant sound bite, “China’s Katrina,” according to China Digital Times. Sunday’s tone-deaf patriotic headlines prove that, by contrast, propaganda authorities guiding state media coverage have learned nothing at all.

Wenzhou coverage was not an unqualified success. Censors banned journalists from revisiting the site to commemorate the anniversary this year, according to the The Wall Street Journal. Though the Ministry of Railways promised to examine the causes of the disaster, victims complain they have yet to hear from any investigators, the Journal said. Despite the lack of public trust, China is plowing ahead with rail investment, Bloomberg reports.

When Shifang environmental protests were in the news earlier this month, CPJ expressed concern that public expressions of anger at the government, commonly perceived as victories at home and abroad, risk “perpetuating a cycle of protests that authorities can diffuse without the need for reform or redress for serious injustice.” Journalists in Wenzhou had the power to challenge the state’s narrative, but not to ensure full accountability after public attention waned. “Officials kowtowing to citizens’ demands to quell protests has become routine in China, but the follow-through has not,” we argued.

China’s media could correct that imbalance. If AP’s unnamed CCTV journalist kept asking her difficult questions a week, a month, a year from now, the shortcomings of the city’s handling of the floods would remain visible. But you can’t blame her for stepping back. One year ago today, CCTV producer Wang Qinglei broadcast a reflective episode of his news show “24 hours” on the Wenzhou train crash; he was suspended a week later. For freelancers, punitive measures are even harsher: We documented 27 journalists imprisoned for their work in China on December 1, 2011. One, Tan Zuoren, had challenged the official death toll following the 2009 Sichuan earthquake.

Fear of reprisals may quell news coverage in the short term, but the indignation that fuels independent reporting online, and motivates journalists to argue back at press conferences, accumulates over time. As the disgraced Wang Qinglei put it on his microblog last year: “Constantly restricting and blocking is a way to make things appear peaceful on the surface, but it’s actually going to stir up an even bigger crisis.” The flooding may not be the crisis that tips the balance. But it has caused another wave of reporters, professional and otherwise, to get involved and document what happened, in spite of restrictions. Propaganda officials, by failing to adapt to this reality, reveal themselves as the archaic, vindictive bureaucrats they are. They have no place in today’s China. We hope the next generation of leaders thinks so too.","Thu, 26 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://cpj.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/china.flood_.rtrs_.222.jpg,"['propaganda', 'officials', 'official', 'wang', 'chinas', 'journalists', 'wenzhou', 'katrina', 'toll', 'state', 'week', 'boat', 'china', 'miss']",

Recently, downpours in Beijing and other cities in north China have caused floods and severe water loggings. As the waters gradually recede, it's time for city constructors and administrators to review their responsibility and management to address maladies in the urban flood control infrastructure.

As the public chides the city's waterlogged streets as an ""ocean in the city"", they also express their helplessness about the transportation meltdowns that happen when flooding occurs. Although heavy rains have triggered the floods, nature is not the only factor that has contributed the recent severe loss of life and property. Inefficient management and construction defects should be taken into consideration. Improving the city's drainage system is a necessity to safeguard lives. Local governments should treat these improvements seriously if they want to establish livable cities which take into account people's well-being and livelihoods.

More and more municipal governments have vowed to construct their cities to international standards, drawing up lots of ambitious plans and slogans. Cities have expanded crazily. Skyscrapers, business districts and industrial parks have mushroomed. Despite this prosperity, even the biggest and richest of China's cities have not been built to handle a rainstorm.

Compared with the fever for constructing eye-catching buildings on the surface, underground drainage systems have been neglected in recent years. Sewage tubes and spillways are old and small. They can not match with the rapid expansion of urban cities any more. Maintenance and improvements have been negligible. That's why cities have been flooded time and time again.

City construction and development needs a long-term foresight and technical know-how. Urban planning cannot only focus on image projects. Short-sighted decisions not only weaken the real effects, but also cause great waste of social resources.

Although, some cities have spent several billion yuan on the renovation of drainage networks, cities are still flooding. Urban flood discharge management should be included in the city's flood control system. Construction standards for urban drainage systems must be of the same as dams or dykes. Once established, the systems will have lasting benefits.

French writer Victor Hugo once said that the sewer is the conscience of the city. After 150 years, these words are still relevant to our lives. Compared with foreign countries, we are not short of technology or money. What we lack is responsibility for a sustained and healthy development of our cities. Ganzhou City in Jiangxi Province is called a magic city for its record of never flooding in a thousand years. The secret of its magic lies in its drainage systems built during the Song Dynasty (960 A.D.-1279 A.D.) Results show that it's not impossible to change the reality if we have the courage to bear the responsibility.

We have learned a lesson from last Saturday's downpours ― we need to change how we think when it comes to urban construction and development, this time using a more conscientious mind.

China has relocated 40,800 residents in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, as the year's first flood peak hit the middle reaches of the Yellow River, flood control authorities said Saturday.

Caused by recent torrential rains, water levels rose quickly on both the trunk stream and tributaries of the Yellow River's middle reaches, the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters said.

The flux of a flood peak at the Wubu Hydrologic Station in Wubu county of Shaanxi's city of Yulin reached 10,600 cubic meters per second at 1 p.m. Friday, marking the highest level since 1989, the headquarters said.

The flood waters passed the downstream Longmen Hydrologic Station at 7,620 cubic meters per second at 7 a.m. Saturday, the highest level since 1996, it said.

The headquarters said flood waters have inundated beach areas and low-lying lands as well as some water control and diversion projects, it said.

The headquarters said all residents of beach areas threatened by flooding have been relocated and the two affected provinces have dispatched personnel to check dams and increase flood-control materials.","Sun, 29 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",,"['saidthe', 'waters', 'flood', 'control', 'second', 'hits', 'yellow', 'relocated', '40800', 'river', 'headquarters', 'wubu', 'water', 'flooding', 'station']", 
8,8,FL-2012-000121-CHN,China’s New Political Class: The People - Council on Foreign Relations,https://www.cfr.org/blog/chinas-new-political-class-people,"Chinese people power has arrived. As China’s top officials meet in Beidaihe to finalize their selections for the country’s new leadership, they are being overshadowed by a different, and increasingly potent, political class—the Chinese people. From Beijing to Jiangsu to Guangdong, Chinese citizens are making their voices heard on the Internet and their actions felt on the streets. Take the terrible flooding in Beijing this past weekend. Thus far, the municipal government estimates that the flooding has caused around $1.88 billion in damages, with more than 65,ooo residents evacuated from their homes and 77 dead. The local government was clearly caught flat-footed: the early warning system failed; police officers were reportedly busy ticketing stranded cars rather than helping citizens in need; and workers at toll plazas continued to collect fees as people desperately tried to escape the rising waters. Popular criticism over the government’s handling of the crisis has been unrelenting, and even the state-supported Global Times has reported on how the government’s credibility was damaged by its weak response.

Yet in important ways, the government’s inaction has become a secondary story. Beijing residents didn’t wait for their officials to do the right thing. As China Digital Times described, Weibo came alive with offers of help: “I live near Tiantan East Gate. If anyone nearby needs to rest, you can come to my place…”; “My office is at Zuojiazhuang A2 Beijing Friendship Garden 1-6H. We have water, snacks, TV, computers, wifi, beds sofas, Sanguo Sha and hot showers! All for free!...” Hundreds of people drove to Beijing Capital Airport to try to assist the 80,000 odd passengers stranded there.

Further down China’s coast, a different form of people power has emerged, and a new generation of political activists is taking hold. In Qidong, Jiangsu province, public health concerns have led thousands of high school students and others to organize a protest to block the construction of a new sewage treatment plant. Via the Internet, the students found inspiration in the June protest in Shifang, Sichuan Province, where tens of thousands of people (including high school students) blocked plans for a molybdenum-copper alloy factory. With the Qidong protest slated for this coming Saturday, local officials are working overtime to quash the demonstration, even calling teachers back from their vacations to pressure the students to stay home.

Further south in Foshan, Guangdong Province, Chinese villagers once again took to the streets in an attempt to obtain justice in the face of local official corruption and illegal land grabs. Here too, the Internet proved a decisive factor: local residents first learned about the illegal land sales by reading government websites.

Chinese officials are grappling with how best to navigate this growing phenomenon of Chinese people power facilitated by the Internet. Certainly, they are trying to co-opt the technology to get their own message out to the people. Many officials and government offices have Weibo accounts which they use to communicate directly with their constituents: in one county in Zhejiang Province, a Weibo writing test is now included in the promotion exam for local officials. And, while Party censors have responded in their usual heavy-handed manner to the criticism surrounding Beijing’s flood response, Beijing municipal government spokeswoman Wang Hui has used her personal account to address the concerns of the people in a relatively open and direct manner, calling the people’s discontent “very normal” and acknowledging that the government has much work to do.

Some in the Party leadership also recognize that the challenge they face in building good governance is more than good messaging. At a recent gathering of municipal party secretaries, Li Yuanchao, who oversees personnel appointments from his perch as head of the Organization Department and is a likely candidate for the Standing Committee of the Politburo, spoke forcefully of the need for local party secretaries to “understand and comply with the will of the people.” Moreover, he emphasized officials must understand that they are basically “servants of the public” and that the satisfaction of the public is the most basic measure of the officials’ work.

Li’s message is one that has been delivered many times in recent years, apparently to little effect. It seems, however, that the country’s newest political actors—the Chinese people—have heard Li’s message and are more than willing to take to the web and to the streets to let their local officials know they are not going to forget it.","Thu, 26 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cfr.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_xl/public/image/2012/07/7-26-beijing-flood-small.jpg,"['chinese', 'students', 'class', 'officials', 'local', 'political', 'times', 'weibo', 'chinas', 'internet', 'province', 'beijing', 'party']",

The flooding has been exacerbated by exceedingly dry conditions caused by a three year province-wide drought.

In addition to the six deaths, several people have gone missing or have been injured. The rains have caused an estimated 49 million yuan (US$7.7 million) in damages, InKunming is reporting.

Zhaotong prefecture (昭通郡) in northeast Yunnan was especially hard hit by repeated downpours. The remote prefecture is home to roughly five and a half million people, 130,000 of which have been left homeless by recent rains. The area is one of Yunnan's poorest and is often beset by flooding and landslides.

The long-running drought in Yunnan has created parched farmland that is unable to support crops or properly drain rainwater. In drought conditions the soil clumps together into hard-packed chunks that are unable to absorb precipitation.

When heavy rains fall on drought-stricken areas, flash flooding often occurs. The sunbaked soil functions more like rock than earth, causing the water to pass over the ground instead of soaking into it.

The weather forecast for Yunnan does not bode well for areas already dealing with too much rain. The Chinese Meteorological Administration (CMA) is warning that a massive storm system that inundated the Beijing metropolitan area with upwards of 45 centimeters of rain and killed at least 37 people is moving west.

Forecasts by the CMA are calling for 10-16 centimeters of rain in Sichuan and Yunnan over the next several days. The Chinese State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters is bracing for more flooding after 4,300 people nationwide have gone missing or are presumed dead following recent rains.

The typhoon Vicente that hit Hong Kong on Monday is currently passing through the North of Vietnam and is weakening to a tropical depression, Ttoitrenews is reporting. The strongest tropical storm to have hit southern China this year is expected not to affect Yunnan.

The Beijing Municipal Government Information Office has released a 24-hour public hotline (010-6201-4533) for those with information about missing victims, according to the official micro blog of the municipal government.

Seven days after the heaviest rain in more than six decades hit the capital, relatives and residents were still searching for those missing since the downpour. Meanwhile, the public security bureau is still trying to determine the identities of the 11 unidentified victims through DNA identification.

Those searching for missing relatives or friends are doing so through various channels, including messages on weibo, China's popular Twitter-like micro-blogging service, and by posting physical messages around the areas where the missing persons disappeared.

Wang Yang, a resident in his 30s from Beijing's Yanqing county, has put up posters and sent out fliers with a photo and information about his dad, a 61-year-old man who disappeared in the night of July 21 when the downpour hit the city.

Although many posters have been put up in the area where his dad might be, Wang has got no messages or information about his whereabouts.

Wang said his dad, who was going to take Bus 919 from Yanqing to downtown Beijing, was never heard from after 5 pm that day.

""I vividly remember he was wearing a gray T-shirt and black trousers, a gray cap and carrying a bag,"" said Wang. ""That might be the last image I have of my dad.""

Wang said he was not allowed to see the unidentified victims as they are already unidentifiable. However, the police said they are working on the DNA of the victims and will release the identities of them soon.

Wang and his mother have had their DNA extracted for comparison with the unidentified victims, and are still anxiously waiting for the results.

""It is a blow to the whole family indeed,"" said Wang. ""However, as long as we have not heard from the police, we will keep looking for my father, through all means.""

Also still missing is Yang Han, a 29-year-old from Fangshan district, who was swept away on July 25, according to his 51-year-old father, Yang Sumin.

The local police station has collected his son's DNA on Wednesday but the family hasn't received any feedback, according to Yang Sumin.

In the disaster-hit areas, volunteers are searching for those missing in the past few days.

""It's not clear whether or when we can find the missing victims in this area,"" Zhao Lijie, a publicity officer at Chengguan town of Fangshan district, told China Daily on Friday. ""But we will not give up. Many local residents are voluntarily working together to find those missing in the past few days.""

Meanwhile, the hunt for the missing continues.

Sitting on the a blue airbed while floating on a reservoir now filled with floating branches, animal carcasses and trash, 60-year-old Chen Baocun from Gushankou village of Fangshan district has been searching for his companion since July 21. The missing man, 61-year-old Cai Shoujiang, was swept away by the flood that hit the district, according to the Beijing News.

""I will do whatever I can to find him,"" said Chen. ""He's too good a guy to leave us.""

Cai was at the foot of the hill when the rainfall and the flood hit the village on July 21. Because of his poor hearing, Cai remained at the foot of the hill while the residents were asked to move to higher ground.

""One wave, and he's gone,"" Chen said.

Zheng Zhijie, Cai's sister-in-law, said that Cai left nothing but a notebook, about eight patched items of clothing and a ponytail, which Cai used to drive mosquitoes away from his paralyzed father, who is in his 90s.

Pan Anjun, deputy head of the municipal flood control and drought relief headquarters, said that although there have been no further reports of missing people, the headquarters will continue search efforts.

His words were echoed by Zhai Ruisheng, Party chief of the Beicheying village in Fengtai district, who said that no reports of missing people has been received recently, and the village is now working on clearing the streets and mending the local infrastructure while distributing relief materials to residents in the disaster areas.

Villager You Fengqi said, ""We are now clearing the sludge stuck in the closets and clearing up the soaked quilts and clothes. It might take a month to get the village back in shape. The losses are just immeasurable.""

The rain, which started on Wednesday evening, hit the northern part of the city the hardest. Dasi township in the suburban Xiqing district was the worst-affected area, receiving 34.5 centimeters of rain, according to the Tianjin Meteorological Bureau. The city received an average downfall of 14.7 cm.

Fearing a repeat of the mayhem experienced in the capital on Saturday, when the heaviest rain in more than six decades caused the deaths of at least 77 people, the Tianjin government was prepared for the predicted downpour.

According to Deng Fushun, director of the Tianjin Municipal Office of Civil Air Defense, the city practiced drills in the 16 districts and counties of the city on Wednesday to get ready for the emergency.

On Thursday the local fire prevention bureau sent 190 fire engines and 1,140 rescuers to help retrieve the vehicles and evacuate pedestrians stranded by the flood.

The rain has flooded many downtown streets, vehicles and even houses.

Dozens of vehicles were stranded on Baidi Road in Nankai district where many pedestrians had to walk in knee-deep water.

""The water in Xiangyang Street is waist deep,"" said Ma Lin, a resident in the district.

Cui Yang, from Hexi district in Tianjin, has failed to get the water out of his home, which flooded on Thursday.

""The water in my apartment has reached my knees,"" Cui said. ""I have encountered a similar situation a few years ago and after all these years no local authorities have ever come to check the pipelines.

""In the next three hours, according to the latest weather report, we have to pack up and go to safer places,"" Cui said.

He Xu, an employee of DHL Express, was driving to his office in Beichen district of Tianjin at 9 am on Thursday when his car flooded.

""I have been bombarded with text messages from city authorities and online shopping companies warning of the downpour, but I did not expect the water would be this high,"" the 30-year-old said.

He said most workers were allowed to go home early on Thursday due to safety concerns and his company's services were suspended for a day.

Many restaurants in Tianjin closed due to flooding.

The subbranch of Go Believe on Nanjing Road, a famous brand of baozi (steamed stuffed bun), from Tianjin, flooded on Thursday morning but resumed business at about 12 pm when the water receded.

All 193 pumping stations in the city along with 24 temporary pumps, have been working, to prevent flooding, especially in low-lying areas and districts with poor drainage facilities, including Beichen district, Hongqiao district and Hebei district, the drainage department in Tianjin said.

The rain has also disrupted air traffic in the city.

Some 20 flights were canceled and 34 delayed. More than 5,000 passengers have been stranded at the airport because of the downpour.

The first flight, an incoming flight from Shanghai, landed in Tianjin after the rain subsided at 11:32 am and the first departing flight took off at 12:08 pm.

Railway transportation has not been affected, according to Jin Hua, a publicity officer at the Tianjin Railway Station.

The station has increased personnel to help the stranded passengers, said Jin.

According to the Tianjin Meteorological Bureau, because the heavy rainfall saturated soil in the mountains, it is important to be well prepared for possible geological disasters in the mountainous areas in the northern part of the city.

The downpour in the city has resulted in an economic loss of more than 140 million yuan ($22 million), with the direct economic loss in fields of agriculture reaching 137 million yuan.","Fri, 27 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",,"['million', 'road', 'hit', 'tianjin', 'heavy', 'city', 'vehicles', 'district', 'rain', 'flooded', 'rainfall', 'water', 'stranded']",

[Photo/Agencies]

LONDON - Arsen Galstyan became Russia's first Olympic judo winner since the collapse of the former Soviet Union and dedicated his gold medal to those affected by recent floods in his homeland.

""I feel absolutely wonderful,"" said Galstyan, 23, who stunned firm favourite and world number one Rishod Sobirov of Uzbekistan on his way to victory.

""My medal will mean a lot, especially (to) people who are suffering from the flood.""

Flash floods earlier this month killed 171 people and damaged more than 4,000 homes in the region of southern Russia from where he hails.

Galstyan's route to gold could hardly have been harder. Having only just overcome South Korean Choi Gwang-Hyeon, his close encounter with Sobirov, who had been aiming to add an Olympic gold to his two successive world titles, was only settled with a waza-ari throw in the extra time golden score period.

In the final, it was a different matter, beating Japan's Hiroaki Hiraoka, silver medallist at last year's world championships, with an ippon, an automatic winning score, just 40 seconds into their clash.

He joined jubilant Russian team mates in celebrations in front of a standing ovation from a crowd which included a large number of disappointed Japanese fans.

""I always imagined this situation. I always had hope,"" Galstyan added. ""My medal will show that Russian judo athletes and Russian sport should be number one.""

Hiraoka, who suffered disappointment when losing in the first round in Beijing four years ago, was unhappy to only take silver in London.

""I worked really hard for the last four years and still I'm not satisfied with the colour of my medal but I did the best that I can,"" he said.

13,13,FL-2012-000121-CHN,Flood risk rampant across Asia's factory zones | News - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/flood-risk-rampant-across-asias-factory-zones/,"Global insurance companies are struggling to get a grip on their flood exposure in Asia nearly a year after one of the world’s costliest disasters hit Thailand, with executives fearing an even worse event looms in the region.

Some firms learnt from the Thai floods, with new defences built to protect multi-billion dollar industrial estates in the country. Insurance premiums have also gone up, but factory construction in flood-prone areas remains rampant across Asia.

Insurance executives say the industry is vulnerable to another major flood, with scientists identifying the coastal plains of southern China as one area at greatest risk.

“When I go and look at these industrial parks and ports in some of the low-lying coastal areas, I just have to stand back and think: Who’s insuring these things? Who’s done the risk assessment?” said Adam Switzer, a coastal scientist at the Earth Observatory in Singapore.

“What I consistently see on the coasts throughout Asia is that we’re still making the same sorts of mistakes.”

The Thai floods hit nearly 1,000 factories feeding global supply chains - particularly in the auto sector - costing insurers an estimated $20 billion.

In the rush for development that has lifted millions out of poverty in Asia, many factories have been built along coasts, especially in river deltas. According to insurance industry executives, most construction was done without long-term historical data on floods and storms.

On top of that, rising sea levels, increasing rainfall and more intense storms - together with more people and infrastructure - mean the risks have multiplied.

“We should be identifying these pockets of exposure earlier,” said Scott Ryrie, Asia-Pacific vice chairman for Guy Carpenter, a global insurance industry services firm.

The goal, insurance executives say, is to break the cycle of paying for the same losses over and over again.

After the Thai floods, global reinsurer Swiss Re reassessed flood risk in emerging markets. The report’s No. 1 risk was China, whose vast industrial estates are at the heart of global manufacturing, making everything from iPads to brake pads.

Among other Asian countries listed, Malaysia was 5, Indonesia 7 and India 10. Thailand was ninth.

Munich Re and Guy Carpenter have also reviewed flood risk models, particularly for industrial parks in Asia.

“A new risk awareness has to set in along the entire value chain,” said Tobias Farny, Munich Re’s Asia-Pacific chief executive. “The exposures present need to be defined, described and ring-fenced in order to become insurable.”

Ryrie said insurers in many countries have contained risks by imposing tighter payout limits and pushing for better historical data to improve risk models.

Where next?

At an industrial estate on the flat plains north of Bangkok, where Japan’s Toshiba makes lighting and home appliances, workers rush to finish a 9.5-km (6-mile) concrete and earth dike that is 1.5 metres (5 ft) higher than the old one.

Behind them, a brown stain runs along the factory buildings where floodwaters lingered for two months, knocking out major foreign-owned manufacturing operations and triggering a flurry of business interruption claims around the world.

Many in the insurance sector agree that an even bigger loss is likely i n China, the motor of global manufacturing, where large areas of factory estates are vulnerable to flooding and storms.

Fierce competition among Chinese insurers, low premium prices and a lack of long-term disaster risk assessment mean insurance companies are potentially exposed to big losses.

“If we have a really extreme event in China, I am quite certain there would be some surprises for the insurance industry,” said Jens Mehlhorn, head of Swiss Re’s flood group. “The flooding we see currently in China is just average flooding. We haven’t seen a 50- or 100-year flood event in the past 5 to 10 years.”

The Pearl River Delta is one of China’s biggest industrial zones. The western side of the delta, constructed on sediment-filled fish ponds and rice paddies, is flat for up to 100 km (60 miles) inland, and 40 percent is less than 2 metres (6.5 ft) above sea level.

The government has not published detailed maps showing China’s most critical flood zones.

Meanwhile, competition in one of the world’s biggest insurance markets has driven the cost of property cover 20 to 30 percent below what it is in other Asian markets, said Alex Yip, China chairman and general manager of insurance broker and corporate advisor JLT Lixin.

Price competition last year was so brutal that China’s No. 2 insurer by market capitalisation, Ping An , recorded a nearly 200 million yuan ($31 million) loss on its corporate property and casualty underwriting, despite no major flood loss claims.

Ping An said in an email it cares more about the big picture than the profitability of individual policies. In 2011, Ping An’s property and casualty division overall made a net profit of just under 5 billion yuan ($785 million).

Flood insurance in China is typically sold as part of a general property policy and does not have an upper claims limit, industry experts said. Rapid development and high levels of foreign investment mean the amount insurers are on the hook for in the next major flood has gone up.

“For floods and for earthquakes, to be honest, for international standards, the price is inadequate,” said Zhang Qing, the Beijing-based general manager for State-owned PICC Property & Casualty Co’s reinsurance business.

A recent study by Texas A&M University and Yale University shows the amount of developed land in low-elevation coastal areas in China is skyrocketing. In 2000, 13,500 sq km (5,200 sq miles) of low-elevation coastal land had been built up. By 2030, that is set to nearly quintuple to 63,600 sq km (24,500 sq m), an area nearly as large as the Netherlands and Belgium combined.

Another study, in the journal Irrigation and Drainage in 2010, said one third of China’s farmland, two-thirds of its people, more than 60 percent of its cities and 80 percent of its GDP were threatened by floods.

Maryam Golnaraghi, chief of the World Meteorological Organization’s disaster risk reduction division, said Chinese data is often not detailed enough to be useful - and that some government agencies feel information on water flows is too sensitive to share.

Lessons learned

Thailand is Asia’s most developed auto parts market and a hub for the likes of Toyota, Honda and Mercedes-Benz, making cars and car parts the country’s No. 1 export this year. The floods disrupted more than 100 components makers.

Over the past year, property insurance rates in Thailand have doubled or tripled and flood cover greatly reduced or even refused in some cases, said Jiraphant Asvantanakul, president of The General Insurance Association of Thailand.

Manufacturers such as Toshiba are moving machinery to the second storey, setting up sister operations in other countries and finding back-up warehouses and suppliers, though the bulk of operations remain in Thailand.

“I think the factories will stick with Thailand because the supply chain network is still very strong … it is not that easy to move,” said Kobkarn Watanavarangkul, executive chairwoman of Toshiba’s Thai unit.

Toshiba’s factories are in the Bangkadi industrial estate, one of seven parks built on former rice paddies on floodplains north of Bangkok that were inundated last year, affecting companies such as Sony, Canon and Honda.

Close to where workers were toiling to build new flood defences to protect the complex was a bronze statue of an elderly couple standing on sandbags.

They are the estate’s founders and the statue commemorates a flood in 1995 in which 1 million sandbags were used to fend off high waters, a reminder that this is not the first time the estate has been threatened.

Insurers and reinsurers are also worried about dense concentrations of factories in other parts of Asia, particularly in and around the Indonesian capital Jakarta, where floods in 2005 and 2007 hit large areas.

The low-lying coastal city has 13 rivers flowing through it, is subsiding in parts and faces rising sea levels. It is the nation’s manufacturing base with US, European and Japanese firms operating factories.

In Cikarang, east of Jakarta, five industrial estates with more than 3,000 plants employ over 1 million people.

Farny of Munich Re said natural catastrophe awareness was growing only slowly among insured firms and governments.

“But it is growing,” he said.","Mon, 23 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://eco-business.imgix.net/uploads/ebmedia/fileuploads/wp_uploads/2012/07/ayutthaya-flooded-industrial-estate.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,"['flood', 'factory', 'floods', 'property', 'global', 'nearly', 'rampant', 'industrial', 'insurance', 'zones', 'risk', 'asias', 'china', 'coastal']", 
14,14,FL-2012-000121-CHN,Why the time for a China-India water treaty is now - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2012/07/23/opinion/china-india-water-scarcity/index.html,"Story highlights China, India need to agree on water management of Yarlung-Zangbo river

Precedent for this when India and Pakistan signed Indus Water Treaty in 1960

Chinese construction of Zangmu dam already causing concern for New Delhi

China and India need to reach agreement on how they will manage water from one of the world's great rivers -- the Yarlung-Zangbo-Brahmaputra -- before it becomes another serious impediment to relations between the two Asian heavyweights.

Water scarcity already affects large parts of China and India. As their populations grow and income levels rise, forcing up demand for water-intensive food such as meat, the supply situation will worsen. Inevitably, that means tension over water resources.

There is a regional precedent for a bilateral water treaty: bitter rivals India and Pakistan, under prodding from the World Bank, signed the Indus Waters Treaty in 1960 to cover water use from the Indus and five other rivers that flow through the two nations. While far from perfect, the treaty has given farmers and other users in both countries a framework on which they can make crop production and hydropower decisions.

Already, China's construction of a 540-megawatt hydropower dam on the Yarlung-Zangbo, which flows for 1,700 kilometers (1,050 miles) across the southern Tibetan plateau before it enters Indian territory and becomes the Brahmaputra, is cause for concern in New Delhi. The dam, known as the Zangmu, is due for completion in 2015.

While the Zangmu dam is a relatively small project, there is something much bigger on the horizon: a 38,000-megawatt dam at Motuo, near the river's ""Great Bend,"" which potentially could reduce the volume of water flowing into India and Bangladesh. While China maintains that any dams it builds on its part of the river will have little downstream impact, up to 150 million people living in eastern India and Bangladesh could be affected.

Almost half the world's population -- the 3.5 billion people living in Central, South and East Asia -- relies on water from the great rivers that rise in the Himalayas, the Tibetan plateau, and the Tibetan ethnic areas of China.

The way the most important of these rivers -- the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Salween, Yangzi, Yellow and Mekong -- are used carries the potential for conflict as countries struggle with the challenges of rising populations, pressure on farming and food supplies, diminishing water quality and demand for hydropower.

China has always been prepared to move mountains and people to achieve its economic and social goals. The $25 billion Three Gorges Project , built in the upper reaches of the Yangzi River between 1994-2011, is testament to that.

As many as 1.3 million people were relocated so the dam could be built, both to generate power and as a flood mitigation measure. Its full ecological impact is yet to be determined. Now China is working on its massive $60 billion South-North Water Diversion Project that involves the country's two most important rivers -- the Yangzi and the Yellow -- plus numerous tributaries, canals and other rivers such as the Huai and Hai. It is one of the biggest civil engineering projects conceived anywhere in the world.

First formulated by Chairman Mao Zedong in 1952 as a way to move water from the southern half of China to the dry but heavily populated north, the three-part scheme took its first steps forward in 2002 when work began on the 1,155 kilometer (716 mile) eastern route. This part of the project, scheduled for completion in 2013, will take water from the Yangzi River via channels to Shandong province, and then by a tunnel under the Yellow River and onwards to the coastal city of Tianjin.

Work on the central route began late in 2003. This 1,267 kilometer (785 mile) diversion is designed to take water from a reservoir on the Han River (a tributary of the Yangzi) along new canals on to Henan and Hebei provinces, and finally to Beijing. A trunk line will also serve Tianjin. Long-term, the western route is the one which causes the most concern, as it involves diverting water from tributaries of the Yangzi, including the Tongtian, Dadu and Yalong rivers, across the Bayankala Mountains to the Yellow River, to supply northwest China.

While some experts doubt the western diversion will ever be built because of the massive cost and logistical challenges of tunnelling under a mountain range, China's record in building mega-projects suggests otherwise.

In March this year, Vice-Premier (and likely premier in 2013) Li Keqiang told a State Council meeting that drought and water shortages in the north had held back economic development there. As a consequence, he said, the South-North diversion project was ""essential.""

In June, China announced it had begun work on a key part of the central route: a $1.4 billion, 45 kilometer tunnel to divert water from the Yangzi river to Beijing. The tunnel should be finished by 2014.

China has always moved faster than India; that's why the time for a water treaty is now.","Mon, 23 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120723013810-river-brahmaputra-story-top.jpg,"['chinaindia', 'china', 'yellow', 'project', 'water', 'dam', 'river', 'india', 'rivers', 'yangzi', 'treaty']",

These two top news items (according to the Beijing Daily, that is) — Beijing’s flooding and Ding’s passing — are not as unrelated as one might think.

Ding, a former Politburo member who served as head of the Central Propaganda Department from 1992 to 2002, featured prominently in the remaking of China’s propaganda system in the post-Mao era. During his 10-year tenure as propaganda czar of China, he infused the system with his conservative ideology as he presided over the development of China’s film industry, commercial media, and importantly, the rise of the Internet in China throughout the 1990s.



This story originally appeared on Asia Blog partner site ChinaFile , a new online magazine from Asia Society's Center on U.S.-China Relations. ChinaFile is currently in Private Beta and will begin publication soon.

Thus, as Danwei’s Jeremy Goldkorn points out in an essay on Chinese media coverage of the flooding, there is no question that the former propaganda czar would likely have ”approved of everything else on the [Beijing Daily’s front] page,” which featured a headline that read “Make the disaster relief, cleaning up the aftermath and stability maintenance the work priority,” as well as three prominently displayed headshots of Beijing’s “most beautiful people” who lost their lives in the flood rescue efforts. This is because a large part of the foundations of China’s contemporary propaganda and thought work system can be traced back to Ding and his ultra-conservative attitude toward the role of media and propaganda in society. It was this very commitment to ultra-conservative policies — and to playing bridge, a beloved hobby of Deng Xiaoping’s — that allowed Ding to win the favor of first Deng and later Jiang Zemin. Ding’s conservative attitude toward the role of the media and propaganda in society is evident in a talk he gave in 1993, one year after he assumed the top departmental position, during which he outlined his view of the Central Propaganda Department’s role:

We are a department in charge of political work, we don’t directly make any products. We mainly provide spiritual impetus, intellectual support and positive public opinion for [China’s] economic development. We aim to make Party policies become the masses’ conscious actions and kindle the masses’ positive thinking and creativity, to unite all forces which can be united, arouse all positive elements, transform negative forces into positive forces and mobilize them to throw themselves into economic construction and reform and opening up.1

Though largely couched in Mao-era rhetoric, Ding’s speech reflects a major shift that took place in CCP thought in the 1980s. No longer was the propaganda system seen as merely a tool to be mobilized toward the transformation of China into a socialist system. Instead, the system was to be used as an instrument to achieve the goals of the Deng-led market transition — the creation of a good market environment and the encouraging of foreign investment.

To this end, Ding encouraged plans to expand the media and technology industries, supporting the creation of the relatively liberal Guangzhou-based newspaper Southern Weekend and CCTV’s investigative news program Focus. But even the most liberal publications and programs were still subject to Ding’s particular interpretation of press freedom. “Freedom does not mean that a person can say what he thinks,” Ding told a press delegation from Hong Kong in August 1994. Freedom, he said, can only be exercised within the framework of the law, which “each country establishes according to its conditions.” As a result, hundreds of media outlets were closed down or purged throughout the 1990s.

In contrast to his predecessors, Deng Liqun and Wang Renzhi, Ding displayed little tolerance for debating with Chinese intellectuals. He sought instead to ban all debate he considered harmful to the government and the Party. As a result, his name lent itself to popular Chinese puns about his obsession with monitoring and censoring (ding) all dissenting opinion, locking up (guan) dissidents, and tracking and controlling (gen) the media.2

With films, Ding trumpeted a similarly conservative doctrine, stressing in a talk in 1996 that “films should have the function of making audiences love the Party and socialist country, rather than arousing their concern and dissatisfaction.” Under Ding’s watch, annual film production declined from more than 145 films in 1995 to only 110 films in 1996, the lowest number since 1990.3 Critically-acclaimed films such as Wang Shuo’s I Am Your Dad and Feng Xiaogang’s Living a Miserable Life were banned, presumably on the grounds that they were considered to be lacking in ideological rectitude.

Ding’s immediate successor and current propaganda chief Li Changchun has largely continued in the conservative precedent set by Ding beginning in the early 1990s. Recent news of the crackdown by State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) on online videos and the prolonged struggle between liberal-leaning domestic newspapers and the propaganda department are evidence of Ding’s imprint on the trajectory of the propaganda and thought work system in China. More than 10 years after his retirement and now even after his passing, the legacy of Ding Guan’gen is a hardwearing legacy that continues on today.","Wed, 25 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://asiasociety.org/sites/default/files/styles/1200w/public/1/120725_DingGuangen.jpg,"['propaganda', 'control', 'system', 'legacy', 'ding', 'conservative', 'chinas', 'chief', 'work', 'dings', 'films', 'beijing', 'leaves', 'media']", 
18,18,FL-2012-000121-CHN,Scores killed in North Korea floods - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2012/7/29/scores-killed-in-north-korea-floods,"Flooding through July leaves 88 people dead, tens of thousands homeless and farmland devastated, state media reports.

Flooding across North Korea this month has killed 88 people, left tens of thousands homeless and devastated swathes of farmland, state media has said.

A week of floods “caused by typhoon and downpour… claimed big human and material losses”, Pyongyang’s official news agency said on Saturday.

The new death toll was a dramatic increase from the figure of eight reported on Wednesday.

A total of 134 people were injured and almost 63,000 people were left homeless by the floods, which started on July 18, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported, with thousands of houses damaged or destroyed.

The biggest loss of human life was in two counties of South Pyongan province, which were hit by torrential rains on Monday and Tuesday, it said.

More than 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) of land for growing crops was “washed away and buried” or “submerged”, KCNA said, a blow for a state that is already beset by persistent severe food shortages.

Emergency order

With rugged terrain and outmoded agricultural practices, the country faces serious difficulties in feeding its 24 million people.

Hundreds of thousands died during a famine in the mid to late-1990s.

UN agencies, after a visit to the North, estimated last November that three million people would need food aid in 2012.

About 300 public buildings and 60 factories were damaged in the floods, as well as large stretches of road, KCNA said.

State media reported earlier this week that 60 flood victims were rescued thanks to a helicopter urgently sent by leader Kim Jong-Un.

The victims, including children and women, were trapped Monday on a hillock in the northwest of the country after a river flooded due to heavy rain, the official news agency said.

“Isolated incommunicado, they did not find a way out, in panic at rising water. At that time a helicopter appeared,” it said.

“After receiving an urgent report, the dear respected Kim Jong-Un issued an emergency sortie order to a unit of the Air Force of the Korean People’s Army.”

Deforestation

After decades of deforestation, North Korea is particularly vulnerable to flooding.

Dozens were killed or injured by a storm and torrential rain in the North in June and July last year. Thousands were also made homeless and large areas of farmland were flooded.

The United States reached a deal on February 29 this year to offer North Korea badly needed food aid in return for a freeze on nuclear and missile tests.

But it rescinded the plan after the North’s failed rocket launch in April, seen by Washington and its allies as an attempted ballistic missile test.

The North has been developing nuclear weapons for decades and staged two nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009.","Sun, 29 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/201172011545324734_20.jpeg?fit=680%2C450,"['reported', 'floods', 'kcna', 'korea', 'scores', 'thousands', 'nuclear', 'food', 'state', 'killed', 'homeless', 'media', 'north']",

Soybean varieties that thrive even in soggy fields could result from studies by U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) scientists. This would help increase profits for Mississippi Delta farmers who can see yield losses as high as 25 percent when they plant soybean crops in rotation with paddy rice.

This work is being conducted by former Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientist Tara VanToai, who now works as a collaborator at ARS' Soil Drainage Research Unit in Columbus, Ohio. ARS is USDA's chief intramural scientific research agency, and this research supports the USDA priority of ensuring international food security.

For more than two decades, VanToai has studied flood tolerance in soybeans in a range of environments, including greenhouses, laboratories, growth chambers, experimental fields and farm fields. She and her colleagues are finding and incorporating genes from non-native soybean varieties in an effort to supplement the narrow genetic base of U.S. soybeans and improve their tolerance to wet soil and associated diseases.

In one study, VanToai used outdoor ""screenhouses""which are greenhouses with screens instead of glassto assess the flood tolerance of 21 soybean lines. This study included soybean lines native to Vietnam and Cambodia, lines developed via selection by farmers and gardeners, and lines from Australia, China, Japan and Taiwan that were created with modern breeding techniques.

The plants were grown in pots. When each plant was in full bloom, it was placed for two weeks in a bucket of water so that the water level was two inches above the soil surface. The screenhouse tests identified the top three flood-tolerant lines: Nam Vang, which is native to Cambodia; VND2, native to China; and ATF15-1, which is native to Australia. Plants from these three lines grew the tallest and produced the biggest seeds and highest yields. When the study was replicated in flooded experimental fields, the results were the same.

African Americans report greater difficulty getting cabs, suspicions of criminal behavior

Study: Chinese perceptions have improved since election of U.S. President Barack Obama

The signing of celebrated black athletes to Chinese teams is also improving relations

A Caucasian American businessman gets into a cab in Beijing. At first he's relieved-- the last few taxis passed straight by him, which is not unusual-- it can be difficult for non-Chinese nationals to get a cab. But then comes an uncomfortable question from the driver: ""Isn't it difficult living in a country with so many black people?""

A question that highlighted another issue: while non-Chinese nationals can have trouble getting a cab, it can be even worse for those with darker skin.

Project manager Kris Derban has lived in China for eight years. He long suspected that taxis were not picking him up because he is an African-American. Recently his suspicions were confirmed when he asked a driver why he had hesitated to take him. ""The driver said, 'I worry Africans will run off and not pay.'""

But catching a cab isn't the only problem. Another common misconception Derban has to contend with is that he is a drug dealer, he said. ""I'll be with a group of friends and someone specifically comes up to ask me if I have drugs. At first I was offended. Now I tease them and say: 'No, do you have drugs?'""

Derban laughs off such incidents, finding humor in the ignorance. Others have been less fortunate.

Liberian student David Johnson moved to China just two months ago. He said he has already been subjected to several racist remarks. ""One time I was walking down the street and someone called me a stupid black c***,"" he reported.

""Maybe it was because I was with a Chinese girl and they don't like that.""

Reports of this kind of racism date back to when Africans were first welcomed into China to study at Chinese universities in the 1960s. And in 1988, a violent, 300-strong mob broke into an African students' dormitory at Nanjing University and destroyed their possessions while chanting ""down with the black devils.""

An Indian businessman at a wholesale market in Yiwu, China, where tensions flared between Indian and Chinese traders earlier this year.

The number of Africans and foreigners living in China has risen significantly since then. Communities have grown up in major cities such as Guangzhou, where 20,000 Africans now live, according to official figures. Some scholars, trying to account for the number of undocumented migrants, put the estimate at around 200,000.

However, ""even in those cities where there is now a concentration of black people, still most Chinese have little to no contact with them,"" said Barry Sautman, a professor of social sciences at the Hong Kong University of Science & Technology who specializes in the issue of race in China. As such, their ideas about blacks are largely shaped by the media, Sautman, said, adding, ""In the media, Africa is portrayed as a house of horrors, with a huge number of people dying from diseases, wars and extremely high crime rates.""

Cultural bias against dark skin

But it is not just Africans and those of African descent who report prejudices in China; others with darker skin are also affected.

Hatim Shah from Mumbai in India has worked in finance in China for six years. He recalled Beijing's visa crackdown on foreigners working or living illegally in the city around the time of the 2008 Olympics.

""I was set to move into a house, but when I went with the landlord to the police station to register, he told me I couldn't live there because the police didn't want brown people in the vicinity,"" he recalled. ""My white South African roommate had no problem."" Although Shah believes the situation has since improved, he still feels that ""if you are brown here, you are not equal.""

He added: ""They assume dark skinned people are doing something dodgy. If there's a white person in the room, they'd rather speak to the white person.""

Paler skin has historically been prized in China and much of Asia. Even today skin-lightening products remain popular.

""Conversely, darker skin is associated with being a peasant,"" said Sautman. ""So, if you think peasants are oafish and backwards, you associate darker skin with that.""

However, experts say, just because there is a historic prejudice against dark skin in China, it was never a given that this prejudice would automatically translate into prejudice against races with darker skins. Sautman believes that type of prejudice was imported from the West.

""It was imported as early as the 1880s by Chinese intellectuals exposed to the Western racist literature. During the Maoist era, expressing such ideas fell out of fashion. Instead, the state promoted the idea that the Chinese should join Africans and rise up together against the white imperialists,"" said Sautman. But from the beginning of China's reform era from the late 1970s, some Western ideas were allowed to flood back in.

While the Chinese government maintains there is no racisim here-- many clearly beg to differ. But they say, given that racism seems less historically entrenched in China than in the West, there is hope it can be stamped out more easily.

The 'Obama effect'

Some non-Chinese nationals say the election of U.S. President Barack Obama and the growing number of black sports stars playing for Chinese teams - such as basketball's Stephon Marbury and footballer Didier Drogba - has helped change perceptions.

A study conducted by Yunying Zhang at Austin Peay State University and Alexis Tan at Washington State University showed that negative stereotypes held about African-Americans-- for example, that they were 'violent', 'loud' or 'aggressive' -- were less likely to be held by Chinese people after President Obama's election. Meanwhile Africans and African-Americans living in China report that since the election, Chinese people they meet are now more likely to bring up the president or the latest athlete signed to a Chinese team than mention negative stereotypes.

Real-life encounters with ordinary Africans and African-Americans also play a part in dispelling racist myths. In a study of attitudes in Guangzhou, Sautman found a correlation between Chinese people actually living and working with Africans and having a more positive attitude towards the African community there.

Derban, for his part, said: ""I try to present myself in such a way that I always leave a good impression. The racism here might be blatant, but, unlike the West, because it's not hidden, I know what I am dealing with. I can openly talk to people about it and help change impressions.""

Loretta Evans, an African-American who has been in China for eight years feels the same. ""Yes, I've sometimes had people stare or touch my skin, as if to see whether it's going to rub off,"" she said. ""But I think this comes from curiosity not negativity. Here I don't feel the racial tension I feel back home. I've done things, such as setting up my own geophysics company, which as I black woman I might not have been able to do in the States.

""Yes, I'm treated differently from Chinese people. But here I'm different first, black second.""","Tue, 24 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120724031709-china-derban-olympics-story-top.jpg,"['chinese', 'darker', 'university', 'skin', 'prejudice', 'tinted', 'sautman', 'living', 'africans', 'white', 'black', 'china']",

Fourth of five parts

XIAMEN, China — A 6-year-old girl with a bob haircut sat alone on an enormous wraparound couch, dwarfed by the living room furniture and a giant flat-screen TV.

As she flicked the remote in search of cartoons, her parents pointed proudly to the recessed lighting and high ceilings. Then they proceeded with an official tour of their three-story house with white marble floors, oversized windows and a granite entryway flanked by a Corinthian column.



All of this was paid for with a $100,000 interest-free loan from the Chinese government, an incentive to keep the family’s size “in policy.” For these residents of a rapidly developing rural area, that meant sticking to two girls and giving up the chance to have a son.

The husband, Zhang Qing Ting, an electrical technician, said living in a modern subdivision for in-policy families beats the usual cramped apartments with no garages. He and his wife, Chen Hui Ping, a factory worker, will also be eligible for cash payments when they retire.

“Many of my friends envy me,” Zhang said, mopping sweat from his neck as a dozen local officials and family planning bureaucrats looked on. The couple had been given a day off work to showcase the benefits of their restraint to two foreign journalists.

Jin Jing, chairman of Chao Le village, summed up the message: “If you practice family planning, you can get this kind of reward.”

For more than three decades, the most populous nation on Earth has been running a massive social experiment, using elaborate incentives and penalties to limit family size.

The aim was to banish hunger and raise living standards, and by many measures the results have been impressive. By reducing the number of dependents per household and freeing more women to enter the workforce, population control efforts have helped lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and contributed to China’s spectacular economic growth.

Prosperity has exacted a steep environmental toll, however.

The colossal industrial expansion of recent decades has depleted natural resources and polluted the skies and streams. China now consumes half the world’s coal supply. It leads all nations in emissions of carbon dioxide, the main contributor to global warming. Pollutants from its smokestacks cause acid rain in Seoul and Tokyo.

China’s experience shows how rising consumption and even modest rates of population growth magnify each other’s impact on the planet.

The country’s population of 1.3 billion is increasing, even with the controls on family size. What is driving the growth is that hundreds of millions of Chinese are still in their reproductive years. On such a huge base, even one or two children per couple adds large numbers — an effect known as population momentum.

Moreover, the Chinese are living better overall: consuming more food, energy and goods than ever. One-fourth of the population — the equivalent of everyone in the United States — has entered the middle class.

The U.S. consumes much more per person. But with a population four times larger, China has a greater collective appetite — and a greater ecological impact — than any other country.

The compounding forces of economic and population growth are a source of increasing concern to scientists. An international team of 1,300 researchers organized by the United Nations concluded that evidence points to “abrupt and potentially irreversible changes” in ecosystems in the next few decades, including mass extinctions and rapid climate change.

Within China, signs of environmental damage are pervasive: massive fish kills, lung-searing smog, denuded landscapes. They have stirred popular discontent and the beginnings of greater official concern for curbing pollution and preserving natural resources.

How this drama plays out is not merely China’s concern. Because of the nation’s sheer size, the rest of the world has an enormous stake in the outcome.

“To solve China’s problems is to solve the world’s problems,” said Yu Xuejun, a director-general in the country’s National Population and Family Planning Commission.

China’s massive population is a legacy of Communist Party Chairman Mao Tse-tung, who strove to increase the ranks of the Red Army by encouraging large families and banning imports of contraceptives and declaring their use a “capitalist plot.”

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, a series of famines claimed tens of millions of lives. The suffering left an enduring awareness that the country couldn’t sustain unlimited population growth.

As Mao’s power waned in the 1970s, other Chinese leaders applied the brakes. Free contraceptives were made widely available. Couples were encouraged to marry later, wait longer to have children and have fewer. In less than a decade, fertility plummeted from nearly six children per woman to fewer than three.

To drive the birthrate down further, Deng Xiaoping imposed the “one-child policy” in 1979. It led to mandated abortions and other abuses by zealous enforcers.

Today, there are many exceptions to the rule: Rural couples and ethnic minorities, for instance, can have two or more children. Although compulsory abortions have been forbidden, families must pay steep fines for having more children than allowed.

Yu, the family planning official, acknowledged that the policy has caused hardships.

“I myself sacrificed,” he said, explaining that he forfeited his own dreams and disappointed his father by failing to produce a son. He and his wife had one child, a daughter.

There is widespread recognition [in China] that natural underpinnings of human prosperity are at grave risk.” — Gretchen Daily, Stanford University ecologist

But he said such forbearance benefited the country, creating a bulge of working-age people with fewer dependents. The resulting burst in productivity is known as the demographic dividend.

Those who work for the vast family planning bureaucracy take great pride in what they see as their contributions to China’s prosperity.

On a five-day tour of the homes of in-policy families, arranged for two Times journalists, officials toasted their achievements every night, feasting on dishes of beef, pork, duck, chicken and fish.

In discussing the country’s population policies, the giddy bureaucrats turned again and again to the economic rewards. “We want to get rich before we get old,” was a common refrain.

Nowhere is the scale of the country’s transformation more vividly displayed than in its cities. Hundreds of millions of Chinese are moving from farms to urban centers to seek jobs and middle-class lifestyles.

In Shanghai, whose population of 23 million exceeds that of Australia, high-rises sprawl in all directions until their silhouettes slip from view, obscured by brown haze.

China, by varying estimates, has more than 100 cities with 1 million or more residents, compared with 9 in the United States. The number of million-plus cities will reach 221 within two decades, according to the McKinsey Global Institute, an economics research firm. More than a dozen will have populations of 25 million or more each.

On the family planning tour, Beijing organizers spoke of Yancheng, with a mere 8 million people, as a backwater. It’s a former salt-harvesting town on the northern bank of the Yangtze River near the coast. Bustling shopping districts, new office buildings, housing projects and other development extend in every direction.

Away from the urban center, farms give way to neat rows of town houses and multistory condominiums.

All this development is being stitched together with high-speed rail and new highways to prepare for 600 million vehicles expected on the roads by 2050.

The U.S. automotive fleet, by far the largest in the world, is less than half that size.

China isn’t hustling just to satisfy the demand from the United States and other countries for cheap merchandise. Increasingly, it is bent on meeting the needs of its own people.

More and more, it is being forced to confront the environmental consequences.

The misty hills of Yunnan province were once covered in pine trees. He Shigui remembers the hush of the fragrant forest when he was a boy.

All that changed when Mao instructed farmers to cut down the trees to grow food for a hungry nation.

Mao’s slogan was “Man must conquer nature,” and He Shigui and other farmers responded. By the 1990s, most of the trees along the Yangtze River were gone, along with the roots that once held the soil in place, creating a natural sponge.

He, his face now as furrowed as a field, still remembers the stormy day in 1998 when rainwater raced down the denuded hillsides, contributing to a disaster downstream.

“Of course I feel bad,” said He, walking across the remains of a red-clay slope on his farm that washed away that day. “There was a flood here and there was a flood there. It was the same water.”

The inundations across central China drowned more than 3,000 people, destroyed 13 million homes and caused at least $24 billion in damage.

The catastrophe also changed the way China viewed trees.

Chinese leaders issued a broad ban on logging and launched an enormous replanting program.

In the last decade, the government has spent more than $90 billion to plant trees across millions of acres and pay farmers to nurture them. An enormous sign just up the hill from He’s farm proclaims, “Keep the trees, protect Mother Yangtze River.”

The reforestation has turned China greener — literally. Scientists have noticed the change on satellite images: Forest cover has expanded from 12% to 20% of the country.

At least in this case, China learned the consequences of heeding Mao’s exhortation to subjugate nature.

“Harmonizing people and nature — that’s how high government discussions frame China’s future development,” said Stanford University ecologist Gretchen Daily, who has studied China’s reforestation. “There is widespread recognition that natural underpinnings of human prosperity are at grave risk.”

The solutions are not always as straightforward as planting trees.

A red truck arrived with a squeal of brakes and a swirling cloud of black dust.

The driver peeled back a tarpaulin to reveal his cargo: coal to stoke one of the massive electricity plants in Shanxi province.

The procession of dump trucks continued around the clock, leaking coal dust that piled up along the road like drifts of black snow. Squat cooling towers hissed like fumaroles. Slender smokestacks disgorged white-gray smoke carried east by the breeze, toward Beijing and beyond.

In nearby Datong, a thick gray-brown haze clings to the city like a dark mist, obscuring the tops of high-rises.

A half-day’s drive south is the ancient city of Linfen, identified by the World Bank six years ago as the most polluted city on Earth.

The city, once known for its fruit and flowers, is now infamous for respiratory illnesses and the shroud of smog that regularly blots out the sun. When the sun does manage to poke through, it appears as a burnt orange fireball, reminiscent of Southern California’s eerie skies during raging wildfires.

China likes to consider itself the world’s factory. Yet it has also become the world’s smokestack.

Tendrils of soot extend across the Pacific. On some days, almost 25% of the pollutants in the air above Los Angeles originated in China, the Environmental Protection Agency has found.

Under international pressure, China has cracked down on some of its dirtiest plants, mainly to reduce soot or pollutants like sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain and aggravates asthma and heart disease.

After the World Bank’s rebuke, officials in Shanxi province closed some of the illegal coal mines in Linfen and its dirtiest coal-fired furnaces.

Chen Mai Zhi, a stout middle-aged woman in black capri pants, said her headaches and dizzy spells have receded, but she still avoids wearing light-colored clothes and doesn’t hang laundry outdoors because of the soot.

Wang Shu Quing has also noticed a difference. The smokestacks bordering her cornfield just north of Linfen no longer cough up black smoke. “They did something inside to change it,” Wang said. “Now you can see the smoke only once in a while.”

Such steps reduce pollution at the local level. But they do nothing to curb China’s consumption of coal or the resulting carbon dioxide emissions.

China relies on coal to meet about two-thirds of its energy needs. Despite major investments in solar, wind and nuclear energy, coal consumption continues to climb.

Although China has the third-largest reserves in the world, it is reaching around the world for more. It overtook Japan this year as the world’s largest coal importer, drawing mostly from Indonesia and Australia. Its imports are expected to double by 2015.

Those trends are worrisome to climate scientists, who say that in order to avoid a potentially catastrophic rise in global temperatures, worldwide carbon dioxide emissions must be cut in half by 2050.

For that to happen, China’s emissions would have to peak by 2020, said Nobuo Tanaka, former director of the Paris-based International Energy Agency, which advises governments on energy issues. But by China’s own projections, its output will rise at least 50% from current levels before peaking around 2035.

It would be all but impossible for other nations to compensate for such an increase, Tanaka said.

Where has Earth been most altered?



Chinese leaders say that capping emissions would cripple industrial growth and urban development in a country that still has 100 million poor people.

The industrialized countries polluted their way to prosperity, their argument goes, so why should the Chinese be penalized?

Advertisement

China’s leaders also have sought credit for their population control policies, which they say averted 400 million births and thus billions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions.

At the same time, they acknowledge that the one-child policy was never meant to be permanent. When it was started in 1979, officials promised to revisit the issue in 30 years. There is some internal pressure and even more international pressure to lift the restrictions.

That worries Yu Xuejun, the director-general with the National Population and Family Planning Commission. The best course, he said, would be “a soft landing” with “incremental adjustments” so that the sacrifices he and others made in forgoing larger families are not erased by a baby boom.

“I cannot imagine if we had 400 million more people in China,” he said.

More than 1,500 are in shelters

One person dies after being rescued, from injuries and heart failure

A ""yellow alert"" is in effect for parts of the country

Heavy rains in central and eastern Costa Rica have triggered floods that have forced evacuations and may be responsible for at least one death, relief workers said Sunday.

Four people are missing, down from eight earlier, according to Freddy Roman, a spokesman for the local Red Cross.

The government has declared a ""yellow alert"" in various parts of Cartago, a central province where one person was reported dead, said Roman. The person was rescued after a landslide, but died on the way to the hospital from injuries and heart failure, he said.

A yellow alert is also in effect for parts of Limon, an eastern province.

More than 1,500 people have taken refuge at shelters and others are waiting to be rescued, according to the Red Cross.

""We have reports of people trapped in their houses that have been flooded by overflow from the Chirripo River, also of several communities that are isolated in other parts of Limon,"" said Guillermo Arroyo, director of operations of the Costa Rican Red Cross.

Heavy rain is typical this time of year in Costa Rica, where the rainy season runs roughly from May-November.","Mon, 30 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120730025948-costa-rica-flooding-story-top.jpg,"['evacuations', 'force', 'floods', 'alert', 'roman', 'yellow', 'person', 'parts', 'rescued', 'rica', 'red', 'limon', 'costa']",

Drought can be sadly common in some areas but it becomes a freak occurrence when severe drought slams the same places for three consecutive years, particularly if said areas were once flowing with water. Yunnan Province, well-known for its tropical rain forests, meets these criteria.



""We have never experienced such drought before and my family's income has tanked,"" Zhang Baoyou told the Global Times in his tobacco field, while he sprayed pesticide on tobacco leaves in scorching heat.



Cigarettes are an important source of income for Yunnan and Zhang is one of many tobacco farmers from Zhanyi county in the city of Qujing.



Having grown tobacco for over 20 years, Zhang tills 0.4 hectares of the crop, and netted an income of 12,000 yuan ($1,882) a year until the area became beleaguered by severe drought in the autumn of 2009.



""In the past two years, I only made 3,000 yuan in net income to feed my family of four, outside of manual labor I have done on the side,"" said Zhang. As a farmer, his family's destiny is determined by how much it rains, and his village has poor water storage facilities.



Zhang's situation is understood by Li Qinxian, 50, a driver in Zhanyi county. Li used to be a farmer and knows how hard life is for them, especially during years of unusually hard drought.



""My family just needs water to live, and the drought hasn't had as much influence on us as it has on Zhang,"" she said.



Zhang said those in his village have enough water for their own personal use, but are far from able to irrigate their fields and crops.



Effects on local lives



Zhang's life has been affected greatly, but his situation is not as bad as that of those living in remote mountain areas,who do not have enough water to survive.



By late May, people who needed water to survive in Qujing amounted to a 10th of its total population of 6 million, reads a brief report from the Office of Drought Relief for Qujing.



On top of this, about a fifth of its population needs some level of help, with many in this group lacking food due to the drought.



According to the report, this drought is the most serious to blight the district since 1961. All of the nine cities and counties that make up Qujing have suffered an absence of rain.



Across all of Yunnan, over 8 million people have been seriously affected, and over half have difficulty in getting drinking water, according to statistics from a working conference for drought relief in March.



Due to the lack of precipitation, the water stored in Qujing's 672 State-owned reservoirs only amounted to 190 million cubic meters by late May. ""This level represents only 20 percent of the water that was stored before the drought happened,"" said Zha Gang, vice director of the office for drought relief for Qujing.



The office is a temporary organization which is responsible for coordinating work between different departments.



Zha told the Global Times that although the entirety of the water stored had reached 370 million cubic meters, just 170 million cubic meters were designated to be used, with the rest kept back to guarantee the safety and operational capacity of the reservoirs.



To encourage more storage of water, officials who manage reservoirs will be rewarded if the level increases, and farmers will get subsidies if they can fill up small dams or ponds.



Furthermore, the local government have set up ""water stations"" to ensure no residents have to travel more than five kilometers to fetch water, said Zha.



Local people are also encouraged to become migrant workers, a policy that seems to be having a major effect as around 25 percent of local residents had left the area by 2011. ""Not all migrant workers are poor people, but we encourage more to leave temporarily considering the current situation,"" said Zha.



Limited access to water has also led quarrels or outright fights between farmers to spiral. Officials have had to step in to help resolve over 1,500 disputes since the drought broke out.

Ecological disasters



Zhang Baoyou is not aware that a major cause for the drought has been wholesale destruction of entire swathes of rainforest, an essential part of the local ecological structure. However, he can see that almost every mountainside around his village is dotted with thirsty eucalyptus trees.



""We know the trees 'drink' too much water, and they are still there, but what can we do?"" another tobacco farmer asked, adding that the land where the trees are planted has cracked due to being so parched.



A lack of rain has added to a perfect storm of causes due to the destruction of green cover, the eucalyptus tree invasion and the failure of the reservoirs, said Na Zhongyuan, director with Yunnan Institute for Ecological Agriculture, based in Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province.



As the need for paper grows, eucalyptus trees, which are essential to the papermaking industry, have been planted massively in Yunnan Province. The province is mountainous and poor families have turned to the trees for quick riches, despite warnings being given by experts in the early days.



Most eucalyptus trees planted in Yunnan have come from Australia. However, Australia's climate differs vastly from China's and it has enough moisture in the air that the trees do not need to depend so much on underground water tables, according to media reports.



In Yunnan, the trees are simply unsuited to this environment. Their mass plantation can make the soil barren, as evidenced by the lack of weeds around them in Yunnan, and they can also kill off native species. In short, they are an unmitigated ecological disaster.



Na said rain forests have been deforested for a decade, with rubber trees often replacing them in Xishuangbanna, to the south of Yunnan.



Rubber trees have been another plant species that has consumed water, with their ground cover reaching 410,000 hectares in 2006, five times of the area in 1998.



Eucalyptus and rubber trees do not store water. Instead, they absorb large quantities of it, destroying the rainforests' function in conserving water supplies, purifying the air and regulating the climate, Na explained.



The unrestricted planting of eucalyptus trees all over Yunnan resulted in the draining of underground water tables, said Na.



As for the reservoirs, Na said they are supposed to function well in three aspects: flood control, drought relief and regulation of water run-offs. However, at the moment, they are not storing water during rainy seasons, which Na says ""runs completely counter to the original purpose for their construction.""



""Those who manage reservoirs only care about themselves, and don't shoulder any responsibilities when the reservoirs are empty,"" said Na.



Na's opinion is shared by Ma Jun, director with Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a non-profit organization based in Beijing.



""When the ecological system is fine, disasters can be prohibited, but once it is destroyed, the situation will be devastating,"" said Ma, adding that while floods are easy to predict during rainy seasons, situations of severe drought can creep up unexpectedly.



Yunnan is a mountainous area, and only a high percentage of forest cover can maintain enough underground water, which is also necessary to ensure rainfall, said Ma.



How to reverse the flow



Ma said this trend of ecological degradation needs to be restrained at all costs before economic and human losses spiral. The construction of new large-scale reservoirs would go some way toward helping, but would be too limited to bring relief to people living in remoter areas.



""More small-scale reservoirs should be built to help people once drought starts,"" said Ma to the Global Times.



To Na, it is the functionality of large-scale reservoirs that is of the highest import. ""Generating electricity is just one function as is well-known. But a less well-known function is just as important, namely maintaining the ecological balance,"" said Na.



The goal of improving the capacity of the reservoirs is becoming to pick up traction.



An official with the Water Resources Department of Yunnan Province told media in 2010 that none of the province's small-scale reservoirs had ever been repaired. Besides, some smaller water sources such as ponds have no funds to maintain them and are not properly supervised or managed, which means they are drained even more easily than small-scale reservoirs.



Reservoirs are not the only issue. ""When the silt from dams is cleared, they can hold more water, and dams being dry provide a good opportunity to do this. However, no one does the job [clearing silt] or even thinks to speak out on such relatively simple relief efforts,"" said Na. He laments that more often than not, slogans to fight against drought are ""sung,"" rather than being applied to specific practical measures.



Repeated attempts to get a comment from the Yunnan Water Resources Department on the drought conditions and the relief measures being taken went unanswered by publishing time.



Both Zhang Baoyou and other villagers told the Global Times that they would have no hope if it didn't rain soon. They have dug a well not far from their farmland, but the water tables are so drained it has not helped much.



They hope the government will come to their rescue and build better water conservation facilities which would allow them to irrigate their farmland and hope to survive through this drought seemingly without end.

It called a tender earlier this month to beef up flood prevention measures at 11 MRT stations, several months after it did the same for six downtown stations.

The 11 stations up for enhancement works this time are: Braddell, Toa Payoh, Boon Keng, Somerset, Outram, Tiong Bahru, Bugis, Lavender, Bishan, Marina Bay and Changi Airport.

The works will include installing flood-barrier systems at the stations, sealing glass panels, vent shafts and other openings to make them watertight, and raising escape staircases.

Contractors are expected to design and install two types of flood-barrier systems at several points in each station - a manual stackable type and a swing-type which stays open during normal times.

Both systems must be designed to be watertight when flood waters are below 1.5m - the height of the flood barriers.

The flood barriers should be made of lightweight aluminium panels, said the LTA in its tender documents.

The stackable barriers must also be made so user-friendly that two people will take no more than 15 minutes to set them up.

A spokesman for the authority said: ‘All MRT stations and associated structures… were designed such that the entrance and crest levels are high enough to accommodate potential flooding in lower lying areas.’

Still, the authority has decided to take additional measures to enhance the flood prevention capability of selected stations given their locations, he said.

This follows an earlier contract to flood-proof six downtown MRT stations.

That project was awarded to Sigma Builders for $2,228,776.

Those six stations - Orchard, City Hall, Raffles Place, Tanjong Pagar, Novena and Little India - are all sited in low-lying areas with track records of flash-floods, but have themselves never been flooded.

Similarly, works at all 11 stations in this second phase are preventive in nature. No MRT station has ever been flooded.

Manually-operated full-height sliding barriers will also be installed at Tiong Bahru and Bugis stations.

The LTA spokesman explained that this was due to both stations’ concourses being located below the lowest level of adjacent buildings.

Work on the first six stations will be completed by the middle of next year, while the next 11 stations should be outfitted by the third quarter of 2014.

Assistant professor Vivien Chua, who teaches in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the National University of Singapore, said it is a good strategy for the authority to take preventive measures.

Temporary flood barrier systems are more reliable in holding back floodwater compared to sandbags, and are also resistant to seepage, she said.

She added that they are ‘also cost-effective solutions compared to the economic cost of flood damage and the inconvenience which might result from flooding at the stations’.

Mr Kevin Kho, a 51-year-old engineer with more than 25 years of experience, said: ‘As the saying goes, a stitch in time saves nine. It’s more cost-effective to have good preventive measures in place.’","Mon, 30 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://eco-business.imgix.net/og_fallback_images/og_facebook.png?h=300&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=300,"['barriers', 'preventive', 'flood', 'stations', 'mrt', 'measures', 'systems', 'works', 'antiflooding', 'authority', '11']", 
30,30,FL-2012-000121-CHN,Anti-flood tank design tried and tested | News - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/anti-flood-tank-design-tried-and-tested/,"A new water detention tank to be built near the Botanic Gardens by 2015 to help prevent floods in the area is not the first in Singapore.

It is likely to be similar to a smaller version built in Opera Estate near Siglap in 2001 to reduce the risk of floods there, according to plans unveiled by national water agency PUB last week.

The tank was built under a school field and cost $31 million when it was completed in 2001. The new tank, which will be under a new carpark for coach buses at the Botanic Gardens, is expected to be 11/2 times larger.

PUB declined to say how much it will cost.

Independent engineers told The Straits Times that the process of building the underground tank, if done properly, will not affect the safety of the ground and buildings nearby.

The rainwater from the new tank could also be used to irrigate the greenery in the Botanic Gardens and nearby Dempsey area, they said.

The Gardens tank is expected to be 15m - or about four housing block storeys - deep, and have a 38,000 cubic metre capacity, about the volume of 15 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

It will hold rainwater temporarily during storms and pump the water back into the drainage system after the storm ends.

It is one of PUB’s two new infrastructure projects to keep the Orchard Road and surrounding areas dry.

The other major project is a canal to be completed by 2017, which will divert rainwater from the over-stressed Stamford Canal to the Singapore River.

PUB will call for tenders for both projects by the year end.

Mr Kevin Kho, 51, an engineer with more than 20 years’ experience, said the larger size of the new tank is not likely to make its construction more difficult.

He said that there are several tried and tested ways to make sure construction of the tank does not affect the surrounding area.

One is to pipe in a mix of cement and sand to harden the soil before excavating it. This prevents cave-ins of soil which may weaken the ground nearby.

Another method is to drill lines of deep holes 1m to 2m-wide and fill them with concrete. These are called caisson piles and are used to create walls which can be braced to prevent soil slips.

After the ground is excavated, a frame of pillars is used to hold up the new roof, said Mr Kho.

‘This is very old technology used in basements and underground carparks throughout Singapore. It’s nothing very risky,’ he said.

A PUB spokesman said last week that contractors for the new detention tank will have to show that its roof can withstand the weight of the coach buses in the new carpark.

Since the Opera Estate underground detention tank was built, floods in the area have been reduced from four to six times a year to almost none.

The construction company which built the tank has since folded.","Thu, 26 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://eco-business.imgix.net/og_fallback_images/og_facebook.png?h=300&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=300,"['underground', 'times', 'antiflood', 'built', 'tried', 'gardens', 'rainwater', 'ground', 'used', 'water', 'tested', 'design', 'tank', 'soil']", 
31,31,FL-2012-000121-CHN,Pasco: No easy fix for Thousand Oaks' flooding woes - Tampabay.com,https://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/pasco-no-easy-fix-for-thousand-oaks-flooding-woes/1241962/,"NEW PORT RICHEY — A month after Tropical Storm Debby, residents of Trinity's Thousand Oaks neighborhood are still struggling with high water.

The neighborhood has long been plagued with flooding problems, with residents saying it stems from the developer's original decision to build the homes up to a foot below the water table.

""Why was this allowed to happen?"" said Cortney King, a Pinellas County teacher who lives on Wavyedge Court. ""Why would they allow the actual building of these houses to begin with?""

King was one of about 50 residents from Thousand Oaks and nearby Trinity Oaks who crowded Tuesday's County Commission meeting. He showed pictures of flooded streets that trapped residents in their homes for days. Water crept up to the edges of some homes and some families had up to 4 inches of water in their home.

""There are many people here who cannot speak because they are so emotional about it,"" said King's wife, Kimberly King.

Ron Levi, president of Trinity Oaks Property Owners Association, added: ""If we get any significant rainfall, over an inch or two, we're just going to flood out again. Something has to be done.""

The residents found a panel of sympathetic commissioners.

""I know we'd like to be able to let you go back to your houses today with an equitable solution to the problem,"" said Commissioner Ann Hildebrand. ""Legally, I don't believe we can do that today.""

Hildebrand noted that Debby was a historic storm that closed major arteries such as Ridge Road and State Road 54. ""God dumped an awful lot of rainwater in west Pasco County,"" she said.

The county has spent $2 million in the neighborhood in the last eight years, including a 2005 study that identified long-term stormwater solutions. The study noted that wetlands in the area are roughly a foot higher than nearby ponds, meaning the ponds cannot drain into the wetlands. The plan called for dredging the wetlands to allow the ponds to drain properly.

County staffers were ready to go forward on that project. But the Southwest Florida Water Management District rejected the request last year, saying the wetlands were not previously damaged by development. That means the county would need hard-to-obtain approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

""We've spent a lot of money trying to fix the problem,"" said County Administrator John Gallagher. ""But we have other regulatory agencies that are in the way. We need to figure out how to get around those regulatory agencies.""

Public works director Mike Garrett said the county disagrees with the water management district's decision and has evidence that the wetland had been previously dredged. If so, the county would simply be performing ongoing maintenance. With a new executive director at the agency commonly known as Swiftmud, Garrett said he is hopeful the agency will change its mind.

County Commissioner Jack Mariano said he wants to quickly pressure Swiftmud to allow the project. If the agency denies the request, he floated the idea of moving forward anyway, and letting them ""go after us later on.""

County Attorney Jeff Steinsnyder warned against such a move, saying the commission could face civil and criminal liability.

If that project continues to stall, King and other residents asked officials to explore other options such as creating retention ponds east of Little Road to collect water there before it flows into Thousand Oaks.

Gallagher suggested that residents assemble a small group of people to work with his staff on potential solutions.

""I think we'll be able to come up with something that works,"" he said. ""Our goal is to keep (the water) out of your houses.""

As a child, she had read about the country in Tin Tin's Blue Lotus adventure book. She imagined it to be luxurious and enigmatic. In 1990, she became one of the first American fashion designers to visit, at a time when bicycles filled dirt roads.

Today, with five stores doing brisk business (and plans for four more this year) and more than 300,000 followers on China's Sina Weibo, she is becoming a household name here, a realization of her 2010 resolution to be widely known in a country that has become more than a business destination.

Von Furstenberg says women should dress for themselves, not men. Provided to China Daily

""For me, it's not just 'Go there and sell',"" she says. ""I have really good friends there, artists and writers and journalists. I've absorbed myself into the culture and have given it a lot of my time. I have real connections there.""

Over the past four years, she has visited up to three times a year, she says. In 2011, she hosted the Red Ball, a glamorous black-tie party at a converted studio factory outside Shanghai owned by artist Zhang Huan. The fete was in celebration of the opening of Diane Von Furstenberg: Journey of a Dress, an exhibition spotlighting her career as both icon and fashion designer. The show featured newly commissioned works by Chinese artists Li Songsong, Zhang Huan, Hai Bo and Yi Zhou.

Then, in late 2011, Citic Press of China released Von Furstenberg's autobiography A Signature Life, translated into Chinese by TV personality and author Huang Hung.

""I am inspired by the whole country,"" Von Furstenberg says. ""I identify very much with Chinese people. And if you are into textiles and silk well - people say the Chinese steal everything, but originally we stole it from them, didn't we? It's the crib of civilization.""

She chose Zhang's factory as the location of her party because of its blend of gritty and modern aesthetics, she says.

""Instead of doing it in a ballroom or a hotel, I wanted to do it in the factory, because that represents China - and it represents me too,"" she says.

The fashion icon's interest in China stems from an innate curiosity, Huang Hung says. Since the two worked together on the translation of Von Furstenberg's autobiography, they have become close friends.

""She was so curious about China, about Chinese women, about us,"" Huang says. ""Most of the time people ask questions about their business or things relevant to their business, but Diane was very different. Her interest in China was broader; it was a genuine intellectual interest in the place, its people and its culture.""

She recalls their first meeting, during which several Chinese colleagues pronounced Diane's name wrong (the correct pronunciation is ""Dee-an""). Her husband, the media mogul Barry Diller, whispered to her, asking whether she would like to correct them.

""Diane simply said, 'It's OK.' This made a great impression on me,"" Huang says. ""It showed that she is very kind and sensitive to other people's feelings. It spoke volumes about who she is.""

Over the course of her career, Von Furstenberg has made women's issues a priority; her DVF Awards disperse money each year to various women's causes. In China, she has gravitated toward strong women, she says. ""But over time I realized that even though they seem like they can conquer the world, they are also vulnerable.""

Huang recalls Von Furstenberg's advice to a successful young designer in China. ""She was pining for a boyfriend, and Diane told her 'Never tell people you cannot find a man'. She stopped, and transformed herself from dressing for men to dressing for herself.""

Von Furstenberg's story is inspiring to many young Chinese women, Huang says. ""I personally think Chinese women are not so keen to take successful business women as role models.

Spokeswoman Sabrina Cheung said in an email China remained a key market for sourcing goods for Germany-based Adidas with more than 300 supplier partners in the country.

The Suzhou Adidas factory employs about 160 workers who were notified of the closure a few months ago and who will receive a benefits package, Cheung said.

The sports apparel industry is becoming increasingly competitive amid China's slowing economy, with Adidas, Nike Inc and Converse competing against up-and-coming Chinese players such as Li Ning Co Ltd, ANTA Sports Products Ltd, 361 Degrees International and China Dongxiang (Group) Co Ltd.

The tougher economic environment is hurting sales as well as manufacturing in the sector.

Earlier this month Li Ning, founded by China's most famous Olympic gymnast and which recently warned of a ""substantial decline"" in 2012 profit, replaced its chief executive and said it would tackle bloated inventory and scale back new store openings.

But Chinese companies need to upgrade to stay competitive

China's software outsourcing industry is expected to grow further despite climbing labor costs and increasingly intense competition from overseas.

""The software industry will play a more important role as the Internet-based services continue to expand globally,"" said Li Yuanming, president of Dalian Software Industry Association. ""Globalization in the software-making industry could provide more clients for Chinese software companies.""

In 2011, the output value of China's software and information services hit a record high of more than 383 billion yuan ($60 billion), up by nearly 40 percent year-on-year, according to an annual report issued by the electronic technology information research institute under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.

Meanwhile, the outsourcing sector took 20.8 percent of the entire software industry in terms of output value, shaking off years of decline since 2007.

Although Chinese-made software holds advantages in terms of price compared with overseas competitors such as Europe and India, local outsourcing providers are in urgent need of upgrading their services to protect the domestic market from incursion by overseas companies.

""We should move fast to keep the business in the country because global players, such as India, are ready to compete against their Chinese counterparts in the Chinese market,"" said Guo Xin, former president of IDC Greater China.

India's IT outsourcing service quickly expanded as the number of the country's talented software writers boomed.

As many as 12 Indian companies were on the list of the top 100 outsourcing companies in the world this year and three Indian firms have found a place in the top 10, data from the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals shows.

China's top-ranked company, Neusoft Corp, barely made it into the top 30.

Indian companies dominated contracts from the United States. Europe is the biggest market for Republic of Ireland companies.

Japan was the largest importer of China's software products over the past four years, followed by the United States.

China's capacity to digest overseas contracts remains weak compared with global players.

Indian companies are able to absorb a transaction value 10 times larger than their Chinese counterparts, Shenzhen-based consulting firm askci.com Group reported.

Furthermore, some analysts said that China's software companies are losing their edge in terms of labor costs, which have been growing by around 20 percent year-on-year over the past couple of years, The Wall Street Journal reported, indicating that increasing salaries were driving companies to move the labor-intensive business to cheaper areas or replace manpower with robots.

Labor costs will not be an advantage for Chinese outsourcing companies. Entrepreneurs across the industry have to find out ways to improve the added value of their products in a bid to survive as overseas outsourcing providers start to enter the Chinese market, said Guo.

But other analysts suggest the increase in salaries should be the last thing Chinese software outsourcing companies worry about.

""China's software outsourcing market is powered by rising demand. Chinese firms are likely to enjoy more orders from both domestic and overseas customers,"" said Ning Wright, partner-in-charge of outsourcing and shared services advisory at KPMG Advisory (China) Ltd. ""Rising labor costs will have very limited effect on the industry in China.""

Li from the Dalian Software Industry Association also believes that the rapid growth of labor costs will not hinder the development of the industry.

""Unlike other manufacturing businesses, software products can be copied and reused. That will help the developers to reduce massive development costs,"" he said.

Although the offshore demand witnessed more than 30 percent year-on-year growth over the years, the sector's share continued to decline because of faster annual growth rate in the Chinese market.

Chinese demand for software outsourcing hit 335 billion yuan last year, taking more than 87 percent of the market share.

""Domestic demand will become the major driver for the industry. The turnover of the domestic market is on a trillion-yuan scale,"" said Li. ""The Chinese market will be one of the largest"".

""China has to pay some old debts before moving forward. The country's level of informatization remains low. Unlike the Western economies, which had conducted an extensive industrial informatization renovation, Chinese companies are lagging far behind in this area,"" said Li.

37,37,FL-2012-000121-CHN,How Far Can Construction Equipment Sales Grow with only the Americas Driving? - ForConstructionPros.com,https://www.forconstructionpros.com/blogs/manfredis-machine-works/blog/10747370/how-far-can-construction-equipment-sales-grow-with-only-the-americas-driving,"Global Cat dealer sales crossed into positive territory about the same time as North America in mid-2010, and have shown healthy growth since then. But monthly gains have dropped to low double digits – up 11% in May but much lower than 20% and 30% growth rates reported last year.

What exactly is going on in the world equipment markets?

China was the engine of growth a year ago, with stocks of Japanese equipment manufacturers rising and falling on daily rumors about how many excavators they sold the month before. The Chinese government promised new stimulus to keep domestic demand high.

That idea has been turned on its ear in 2012. Residential property prices have tumbled with government actions to reduce real-estate speculation and oversupply of homes (mostly condominiums).

Caterpillar dealer statistics suggest the U.S. market is still growing, albeit more slowly than a year ago. The market is up more than 30% in both April and May compared with the same period last year.

Global Cat dealer sales followed a path similar to North America: crossing into positive territory in mid-2010 and exhibiting healthy growth since then. But monthly gains have dropped to low double digits – up 11% in May but much lower than the 20% and 30% growth rates reported last year. Caterpillar’s May Asia/Pacific region growth was up just 5% compared with last year.

The low worldwide growth rate and weak China-region growth have been worrying Wall Street. Caterpillar’s share price was more than $115 in January and recently has been trading at about $85 per share, a decline of 26% in six months.

Komatsu posted on its website a very interesting table that details retail demand by the company’s regions for their seven main product categories which exclude mini-equipment: hydraulic excavators (crawler & wheel mounted), wheel loaders, dump trucks (rigid & articulated), and motor graders. We believe this is the first time they have ever provided investors with this much detail about their markets. We are reasonably certain the data is monthly percent changes but do not know if the percent changes are for units or dollars. Nevertheless, the data provides an estimate over time by region for the seven product categories.

It is interesting to note the strength of the company’s markets overall, although Komatsu did not provide a total worldwide calculation. It’s also interesting to note the slowly deteriorating situation in Europe with some months showing single-digit growth but negative numbers for the first four months of 2012.

Komatsu also broke out separately its hydraulic excavator business in China. It’s no wonder that in early 2011 investors started to be concerned about Komatsu’s exposure to Chinese demand. Markets for Komatsu’s seven product categories, and hydraulic excavators in particular, have dropped precipitously since April 2011. Four categories of products turned negative in April 2011 and have continued to deteriorate for the first four months of 2012.

Sany just postponed its planned Hong Kong listing because of the weak market. The company was trying to launch its first IPO in early 2012. A recent filing was for the sale of the equivalent of $2 billion in exchange for 10% of its total ownership. The $2 billion is 40% below the $3.3 billion the company planned to raise. In the first quarter 2012, the company pumped up its domestic Chinese business by renting and selling machines to customers for little or no money down. By the second quarter the company was unable to convert rentals into permanent sales which forced retroactive adjustments to first-quarter sales.

Zoomlion reported impressive growth in 2011 with revenues reaching 46.3 billion yuan (US$7.3 billion) and a profit surge of 73% to 8 billion yuan (US$1.3 billion). Zoomlion's recent share price declined on investors' concerns about the company’s plan to raise debt in the Hong Kong market of 140 billion yuan (US$22.2 billion). The company plans to use the funds for cash flow loans to customers, mortgage financing, equipment financing and leasing, and other services like guarantees and endorsements. Investor concern deepened with news that a securities analyst from Hong Kong found about half of the concrete pumps the company sold in the first quarter of 2012 lying idle in eastern Jiangsu province. There has also been a rumor, which Zoomlion strongly denied, that the company was considering making a bid for CNH.

Many investors are concerned about whether Zoomlion will be able to collect all of its receivables after selling its construction equipment while also sweetening deals by allowing buyers to postpone the first payment. Property development and construction industries in China are facing increasing business difficulties under hard-hitting measures the government is using to crack down on real estate speculation. Many large-scale infrastructure projects have been suspended due to government policy adjustments as well.

Plans by Sany and Zoomlion to boost sales resemble programs that many publicly owned U.S. manufacturers used in the 1960s and 1970s to improve sales reports and share price. It was easy to boost sales and revenues if you count shipments as sales and book the profits as well. Tenneco Corporation, which owned J.I. Case in that time frame, was notorious for pumping up sales at the end of quarter and year end. Security-and-Exchange-Commission regulations and active shareholder groups put an end to the practices here.

China, which represented 50% of the global market for construction machinery in 2011, may not be able to hold up world machinery markets in 2012. With domestic demand soft, inventory could begin to show up in other markets. Latin America will likely see a surge of Chinese-built machines. Interestingly, during the M&T show in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in June, there was a strong rumor that Caterpillar was shipping 2,000 of its Chinese-built excavators to Latin America. Most Latin American countries require emission controls equivalent to the U.S. EPA's Tier 2 and Tier 3. Caterpillar’s Chinese plants are turning out machines equipped to satisfy Tier 2 and Tier 3. There is little threat, however, that we’ll see a flood of Chinese machines in North America or Europe because of the markets' stricter emission regulations.

Equipment demand in the euro-zone is looking increasingly fragile as countries there sort out banking problems. Even the German economy, which has been a source of strength during the past year, started to wobble a little at mid-year.

That leaves the U.S., Canada and Latin America to drive growth for the balance of 2012. U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) has been limping along at just under 2% in both the first and second quarters. Housing starts have finally started to turn around and the U.S. Congress managed to pass a highway bill that should provide a flow of large road projects over the next couple of years. Canada’s economy is very robust driven by its resource industries. Latin America is strong also driven by mineral and oil industry demand.

Overall, our outlook for the U.S. equipment market is unchanged from our prediction earlier this year. We believe retail equipment sales will grow at slightly less than 10% in 2012 compared with 2011.","Wed, 25 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.forconstructionpros.com/files/base/acbm/fcp/image/2012/07/07012012-catdealersglobalsales_10747381.png?auto=format&fit=max&w=1200,"['2011', 'grow', 'americas', 'america', 'company', 'driving', 'construction', 'equipment', 'far', 'growth', 'billion', 'latin', 'sales', 'market', 'markets']", 
38,38,FL-2012-000121-CHN,'Basarab' surname may not indicate direct relation to Vlad the Impaler - Science Daily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120726121140.htm,"A study by the Genographic Project has shown that not all individuals carrying the Romanian ""Basarab"" surname, the first dynasty of Wallachian kings that included the real-life Dracula, can be direct biological descendants of the Basarab dynasty.

The Basarab dynasty ruled Wallachia, the historical and geographical southern region of present-day Romania, for almost three centuries (1330-1601) and had among its members Vlad III the Impaler, commonly known as Dracula. The ethnic origin of the Basarab family has long been a dispute among historians, with both an Indo-European/Romanian and an Asian Cuman/Turkic origin being suggested. Published July 26 in the journal PLOS ONE, the research was led by Genographic Project Principal Investigator David Comas of the Genographic Project's Western/Central Europe regional center.

The study analyzed the Y-chromosome diversity of 29 Romanian individuals carrying the Basarab surname and compared it with the diversity found in about 150 Romanians from different regions of the country and some 330 individuals from surrounding populations of Ukraine, Hungary and Bulgaria. Different Y-chromosome lineages were found among the individuals that currently carry the name Basarab, which indicates that not all of them could be direct descendants of the Basarab dynasty. Extra-pair paternity could explain the existence of different male lineages, but the high genetic diversity found in the Basarab individuals indicates that Basarab is most likely a polyphyletic name, with multiple unrelated male founders.

""Patrilineal surnames are common in most European countries and are useful markers for male ancestry to answer questions related to the history and structure of human populations. The study of the Y chromosome in males with the Basarab surname is the first genetic analysis on the surname of a royal dynasty,"" said Comas.

All Y-chromosome lineages identified in modern-day Romanians bearing the Basarab name have typical Eastern-European haplotypes that were earlier found in both Romanians and Cumans, a population of Asian origin, rather than carrying eastern Asian haplogroups more specific for Cumans. ""The present study shows that genetic haplogroup composition of the Basarab is very similar to that of the general Romanian population, and none of the haplogroups they carry is of Central or East Asia. However, these results cannot definitively distinguish between a Cuman or a Romanian origin for the Basarab dynasty, and only genetic analysis of ancient DNA from the actual remains of the Wallachian kings will be able to give a definitive answer,"" said Genographic Romanian collaborator Mihai Netea.

One certain conclusion, however, based on the relative heterogeneity of Y-chromosome lineages in modern Basarab from Romania, is that the Basarab dynasty was successful in spreading its name beyond the spread of their genes.

Genographic Project Director and National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Dr. Spencer Wells noted that while the current study failed to find a recent common origin for all of the Basarab men, ""There were telltale signs of related lineages among some of the men that suggested a close relationship that probably predated the establishment of the Basarab dynasty. It would certainly be interesting to extend the study of present-day populations to known Basarab remains to see if they belong to these lineages. Although we didn't identify Vlad the Impaler's Y-chromosome signature in this study, it might still be lurking in the dataset, waiting to be teased out with additional analyses.""","Thu, 26 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,"['surname', 'vlad', 'relation', 'study', 'ychromosome', 'origin', 'genographic', 'lineages', 'direct', 'indicate', 'impaler', 'individuals', 'romanian', 'basarab', 'dynasty']",

The four Chinese cities with the highest GDP - Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen - are the four in the first tier in the list because their economies are conducive to online shopping, according to a report released on Tuesday by Taobao, a domestic online-shopping service provider.

Most of the 24 second-tier cities are from the eastern and central areas and have higher incomes, convenient transportation, and easier access to the Internet. Only three western cities - Chongqing, Xi'an, and Chengdu - were on the second-tier list.

The cities' economies, populations, incomes and online purchases were evaluated in the research, which took two months.

""Among those topics, the most important one for the ranking is the proportion of Taobao users,"" said Zhang Pengfei, an analyst from Alibaba Group, one of China's biggest e-commerce company, which owns Taobao.

""That proportion can be influenced by the population and access to the Internet, which puts the developed eastern and central areas in a strong position.""

In first-tier cities, more than 40 percent of residents had bought items from the website in 2011, and 30 percent of those in second-tier cities had done so, Taobao said.

""It's different from the city levels ranked by the governments, which take political power into consideration as well,"" Zhang said of the rankings, adding that people usually don't possess a clear understanding of their own city's ranking.

""Residents can use our list as a reference because our classification method includes some factors such as the economy, the same as governments do,"" he said.

Online shopping has witnessed a rapid increase both in sales and users in recent years. The annual monthly expense on Taobao per family reached 3,450 yuan ($540) in the first half of 2011, an increase of 13 percent year-on-year. And people between the age of 25 and 45 are the main users.

""Since the proportion of online-shopping lovers is larger in first- and second-tier cities, the rapid increase may be possible in other remote areas, especially fourth- or fifth-tier cities,"" said Chen Shousong, an analyst from Analysys International, based in Beijing.

The cities labeled in the sixth tier saw the largest increase of users in the first six month this year, 151 percent higher, the Taobao report said.

Chen said other online-shopping trends will eventually appear. For examples, items such as fresh vegetables that are ruined by long-distance shipping will become available, thanks to improving transportation, Chen said. In addition, more old people will be among online shoppers in the coming years, Chen said.

In fact, sales and numbers of senior users have increased by 200 percent since 2009.

""But the young group is still the main contributor,"" Chen said.

Bomoda, a DailyCandy-style newsletter targeting Chinese women , has raised $1.4 million from a prestigious list of angel investors.

Brian Buchwald, the New York-based startup's CEO, told us he's trying to establish Bomoda as a trusted brand for the increasing numbers of wealthy Chinese women who have disposable income and want real luxury goods, not the knockoffs which flood their home market.

Buchwald shared a bunch of eye-popping statistics about Chinese luxury-good consumption. The country will soon overtake Japan as the largest market for luxury goods worldwide.

The one that really stuck with us: According to the Pao Consultancy, Chinese women who buy luxury goods spend an average of 11% of their annual disposable income on handbags.

Because of high import duties on luxury goods in China, they're also disposed to take shopping trips to New York, Paris, and other Western cities. So Bomoda's going to dish out travel and luxury-lifestyle advice, too. Bomoda will offer fashion advice and feature hand-selected deals.

""What they’re going through from the consumption perspective is like what we went through in the Industrial Revolution,"" Buchwald told Business Insider.

They may know Louis Vuitton and Prada, but they don't know how to do the kind of high-low mixing and pairing that's au courant in Milan and New York.

The move into international e-commerce might seem unusual for Buchwald, who's one of the few Bomoda staffers who doesn't speak Mandarin. What he does have is an impeccable media resume: Most famously, he spearheaded the creation of Hulu for NBCUniversal.

(Full disclosure: I previously worked for Buchwald when he ran NBC's Local Interactive Media division. And I have a degree in East Asian Languages and Civilizations from the University of Chicago. Both of those may color my enthusiasm for Bomoda's concept.)

But it makes sense that the same kind of trendspotting that had him working on online video in 2006 has led him to this burgeoning, untapped market.

""There's no DailyCandy for China, no Thrillist,"" Buchwald pointed out.

Chief among Bomoda's backers is former Yahoo CEO Terry Semel. Other investors include iNovia Capital, a Canadian venture firm; Ed Goodman of Milestone Venture Partners, whose family previously owned Bergdorf Goodman; and Peter Georgescu, the chairman emeritus of Young & Rubicam.

Unlike Apple Inc, Hewlett-Packard Corp and Acer Inc, which outsourced most of their manufacturing to other companies, the China-based company uses its own factories and employees to assemble its products. [Photo/China Daily]

Although outsourcing manufacturing has become the trend for most PC companies globally, Lenovo Group Ltd, the second largest PC maker worldwide, still keeps about half of its production in-house.

The Chinese company has six solely owned manufacturing bases in China, three of them in Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu. It also will open a new plant in Brazil and begin producing PCs in Japan.

Lenovo plans to invest $30 million building a computer factory and a distribution center in Itu, in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo, the company said in an e-mailed statement.

It will have as many as 700 employees at the unit in two years, when it's expected to reach maximum capacity, Lenovo said.

Compared with Apple Inc, which outsourced most of its manufacturing to Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Group, Lenovo uses its own factories and employees to manufacture its products. In so doing it is working against the industry trend.

Gaining greater end-to-end control will improve performance in all key areas, including pioneering new technology, cost management, delivery cycle times and product quality, company President and Chief Executive Officer Yang Yuanqing said.

In northwestern Beijing's Shangdi area, its factory is next to the company's country headquarters.

Lenovo's Beijing research center is only about 10 minutes drive from the plant. Shuttle buses travel back and forth between the two buildings every day and the company even provides bikes for its employees to commute to work.

Lenovo believes that retaining its own factories gives the company advantages over its peers. ""Selling PCs is like selling fresh fruit,"" said Yang in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. ""The speed of innovation is very fast so you must know how to keep up with the pace, control inventory, match supply with demand and handle very fast turnover.""

About a decade ago, businesses in the West started to move their factories outside their homelands and outsource production overseas. Back then, designing and producing a cell phone required about two years. It was reduced to about a year in 2002. By 2006 it took less than six months and now a smartphone can evolve from a draft into a customer's hand in four months.

Along with the intensive competition in the PC and smartphone industries, quicker reactions and faster service are required to attract customers. However, outsourcing means it takes longer to react to market changes, according to industry experts. In order to cater better to users' needs, many companies are considering moving their production bases to local markets or to bring them back under their own umbrella.

After forming a joint venture with the Japan-based NEC Corp, a provider of IT products and services, and buying the German consumer electronics maker Medion AG, Lenovo's sales in developed economies increased from January to March by 85 percent year-on-year, reaching $3.4 billion. Lenovo is now the largest PC brand in Japan measured by sales.

The company recently decided to shift part of its PC production facilities to Japan by using NEC's factory. The move will reduce the time spent delivering goods from the Chinese plant to the Japanese market to five days. It used to take more than 10 days.

Last year, Lenovo invested in a desktop computer factory in Chengdu. Because the company is producing more mobile Internet products such as tablet PCs and smartphones, it will invest 5 billion yuan ($78 million) to set up a mobile Internet product factory in Chengdu in the next five years.

Last year it invested $300 million in a Taiwan-based original equipment manufacturing company in Hefei, Anhui province, to set up a new production plant.

For its entire 2011 fiscal year ending in March, Lenovo said it made $29.6 billion in sales. During that time, it commanded 12.9 percent of the global PC market, confirming it as the second-largest PC producer and fourth-largest tablet PC producer measured by market share.

The company would deliver ""a high single digit to mid-teen"" percentage growth in earnings per share in the fiscal year, according to an earlier ICBC report.

Lenovo shares fell to their lowest in six months in Hong Kong trading after ICBC International Research Ltd said the company's growth outlook is weakening.

Global computer shipments will rise 5 percent in 2012, which will be a ""challenging year"" because of the debt crisis in the eurozone economy, researcher IDC forecast last month. Lenovo shares have dropped 26 percent in the past two months, compared with a 6.2 percent decline in the benchmark Hang Seng Index amid concern the economic slowdown will hurt computer demand.

""The recent price correction was attributable to the weakening PC growth outlook and its stretched valuation,"" said Kary Sei, a Hong Kong-based analyst with ICBC. ""In view of the slowing global economy, PC demand is likely on the downside.""

Jeff Shafer, a Lenovo spokesman, said: ""We continue to be confident in our strategy and execution and in our overall performance in PCs.""

""As we have stated before, it remains our expectation to grow faster than the market and we continue to make the long-term investments in areas such as product innovation and building our brand that will enable us to maintain our momentum.""

Lenovo will grow ""at a significant premium to market"", said Milko Van Duijl, Lenovo's president for Asia-Pacific and Latin America, in a June 28 interview in Hong Kong. He didn't give a specific growth forecast at the time.

Chen Wei's dream of opening a restaurant chain in Beijing featuring a specialty from his hometown is coming true.

The specialty, called luosifen or rice noodles boiled with snail soup, has become one of the most sought-after dishes in the capital city, after the hit documentary A Bite of China listed sour bamboo shoots, a main ingredient of the dish, as the flavor of Liuzhou, in Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.

In South China, people put bamboo shoots in a big ceramic jar, with water. Then, they seal the jar. A few weeks later, the bamboo shoots sour and can be used as an ingredient in a variety of dishes.

The sour and spicy taste of bamboo shoots complements the mellow and sweet taste of snail soup and rice noodles.

There is a story about luosifen from long ago that tells of a young man who sold rice noodles and a young woman who sold snail soup who set up stalls next to each other in Liuzhou. One day, they had both sold out all their dishes, except for one bowl of rice noodles and one of snail soup. For their own dinner, they decided to add the noodles to the soup and thus luosifen was born.

However, when Chen first introduced the dish to Beijing in 2010, it wasn't popular.

""Few people knew anything about luosifen and couldn't accept the taste. Also, it was hard to rent a property because landlords were worried the dish wouldn't catch on and we couldn't pay their rent,"" Chen says.

The annual rent of his first 230-square-meter restaurant in Beijing was 1.2 million yuan ($190,000) per year and he had to pay it in advance, plus a 100,000 yuan intermediary fee.

""Thanks to A Bite of China more people came to my restaurant, attracted by luosifen. Moreover, other landlords contacted me and wanted to rent me places to open my restaurants,"" he says.

Chen is now busy decorating his second restaurant in Beijing.

""My goal is to open 1,000 branches in Beijing,"" Chen says, adding the number of employees in Liuzhou and the capital has increased from four to 30.

""It's like a dream,"" Chen says.

With sprawling housing developments and state-of-the-art skyscrapers, the outward impression is of a bustling metropolis.

But look closer and the so-called Kangbashi New Area of the Chinese city of Ordos is anything but teeming with people.

Known as the ghost town district of the wealthy mining city, it was built to house a million residents.

But less than 30,000 live in this spanking new town, the construction of which started in 2004.

Yet it is filled with state-of-the-art infrastructure and stunning architectural structures like the Ordos Museum.



There are many reasons why people have stayed away, soaring property prices being the most cited.

Its close proximity to the existing old town of Dongsheng, about 15miles away, is also thought to have kept Kangbashi empty.

These pictures reveal a district filled with elaborate buildings and open spaces that are almost completely devoid of life.

Ordos officials announced they were to build the Kangbashi New Area on the site of two former villages, and next to three existing reservoirs, in 2003.

China last year announced plans to build 20 cities a year for the next 20 years.

Construction continues: But less than 30,000 live in this spanking new town, the construction of which started in 2004

And despite pictures showing some of the country's reported 64million empty homes, Chinese authorities have since erected masses more buildings.

But a government think-tank has warned that China's real estate bubble is getting worse, with property prices in major cities overvalued by as much as 70 per cent.

Of the 35 major cities surveyed in 2010, property prices in eleven, including Beijing and Shanghai, were between 30 and 50 per cent above their market value, the China Daily said, citing the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

Prices in Fuzhou, capital of the south-eastern province of Fujian, had the worst property bubble with average house prices more than 70 per cent higher than their market value, according to the survey conducted in September.

The average price in the 35 cities surveyed was nearly 30 per cent above the market value, the report said.

It is a little patch of Chinese herbs that is believed to correct the body's internal balance and works best as the hottest days of the year descend on us.

Liu Zhihua speaks to doctors and patients on why more are waiting in line for this summer panacea.

It is a herbal patch named after the three hottest periods of the year according to the lunar calendar. Sanfu started on July 18 this year, and as each period lasts 10 days, it will span a period of 30 days. These patches have been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) since the earliest recorded times according to Huangdi Neijing (The Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor), more than 2,000 years ago, the time-tested textbook for TCM practitioners. Sanfu patch treatment became extremely popular in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and enjoyed a revival in recent years as more patients turn to TCM treatment.

But its popularity this summer has caught even the professionals by surprise.

""We knew there would be a lot of demand for sanfu patches treatment, but we didn't expect the hospital to be filled to capacity,"" says Zhang Shu'nan, a TCM specialist of respiratory diseases at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing.

""All the patches we prepared were used up the first day, and we have received calls from other hospitals looking for patches,"" Zhang says.

The treatment is based on the TCM principle of yin and yang, which believes the balance of both elements in the body is vital for good health.

When yang is lacking, chronic diseases attributed to a ""cold nature"", such as coughing, asthma, arthritis, dysmenorrhea and irregular menstruation will take place or get worse in winter.

Sanfu patches contain a paste of herbs that are ""hot"" in nature, and when applied to specific acupuncture points, they replenish the yang elements.

Rong Weihua, a businesswoman and mother of a 3-year-old girl in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, says she believes in TCM, and has been avoiding using Western medicine on her daughter, for fear of side effects.

The toddler had a severe cough last winter, and a TCM doctor Rong trusts told her that sanfu patches would be helpful to prevent such coughs this year.

As the treatment works only during sanfu, a period indicated by TCM when the acupuncture points in the body are most receptive to yang supplements from warm and pungent herbs, Rong had to wait until July 18 to get her daughter treated.

She arrived at about 9:30 am at the Shenzhen Children's Hospital, only to find a long line already waiting. When she finally got both of them seen and treated by 11:30 am, half the morning was gone.

Rong is happy with the patches.

""Even if they are not as effective as the doctors say, at least they are harmless to health, because they are used externally.""

In Chongqing, the demand for sanfu patches is no less. ""People are extremely enthusiastic about sanfu patches this year,"" says Jin Xianchun, director of the TCM department at Xinqiao Hospital.

At the hospital, the use of the patches only picked up after 2008. Patients were skeptical when the consulting doctors recommended the treatment at first. Gradually, as the reputation grew, more and more asked for the patches.

But, Jin was emphatic that patients must be examined by TCM doctors before treatment. Different cold-nature diseases require different herbs applied to different acupuncture points, Jin stresses.

Usually, patients need to get the patches applied on four to 10 acupressure points for three successive years during the sanfu period. Apparently, most patients have no problems with the yearly commitments, Jin says.

At Xinqiao Hospital, at least 500 people received the treatment this year on July 18, he says.

The Pharmaceutical Factory of Capital Institute of Pediatrics is the only manufacturer appointed by the Beijing traditional Chinese medicine bureau and the Beijing drug administration to produce and distribute sanfu patches in Beijing.

Roughly 300 hospitals in the capital, including the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, have bought 1.5 million packages of the patches, enough to treat about 500,000 patients.

For a three-year treatment course, a patient may pay 270 yuan ($42.36).

""Many hospitals called to increase the orders,"" says Liu Chenggui from the factory.

""There are also quite a few hospitals using patches they make themselves, so it is hard to estimate how many patients are using sanfu patches in Beijing.""

Gao Wen, an editor with a publishing house in Beijing, says he has been suffering from rhinitis since 2009, and has failed to make any headway with Western drugs.

He went to the hospital during his noon break to get sanfu patches, and was surprised at the crowd.

""I just want to try and I don't have high expectations,"" Gao says. ""People say TCM has no side effects.""

However, the use of sanfu patches does have some side effects.

Application may lead to local skin irritations, which may result in an inflamed or hot skin, itchiness or allergic reactions, especially among children and those with sensitive skin.

Most experts stress that the components of the herbal paste and the application on acupuncture points vary according to specific needs, and it is best to seek a consultation with a qualified TCM doctor. The misuse of sanfu patches will cause undesirable health issues, experts warn.

""Sanfu patches are not a cure-all,"" notes Zhang Shu'nan, the TCM specialist. ""They must be used under proper TCM instructions.""

It has taken 25 years to evolve from the brick-like dageda (big brother's handset) to the slim iPhone currently in vogue.

The first mobile phone, the Motorola 3200, entered the Chinese market in 1987 and marked the start of a craze that now sees them in nearly everyone's possession.

It is similar for other electronic products that first made their way to China from foreign companies and then began to be produced here en masse because of the country's huge and relatively cheap labor.

Soon the Middle Kingdom became the global manufacturing center after Japan. A random search of electronic products on a retailer's shelves now inevitably reveals ""Made-in-China"" labels or, at least, components produced in the country.

Now, however, some overseas companies are considering moving their manufacturing facilities out of China.

Heading home?

When US President Barack Obama joined Silicon Valley's top luminaries for dinner in California in early 2011, he asked the late Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple Inc, what it would take to start assembling iPhones in the United States.

Jobs' answer was quite straightforward and might have disappointed Obama. ""Those jobs aren't coming back,"" he said, according to another dinner guest. However, one year on and after Jobs' death last year, Tim Cook, his successor as Apple's chief executive officer, gave Obama a more positive reply.

Cook said in a May interview in Rancho Palo Verdes, California, that he wanted the cellphones to be manufactured in the US. Although it would not be easy to achieve the goal, it was a clear hint that it may come to pass. And it fitted in with Obama's call for corporate America to reduce manufacturing outsourcing overseas, especially to China.

Some US companies have been on the move. The Michigan-based Whirlpool Corp, the world's No 1 home appliance maker with sales of $19 billion last year, brought back production of its KitchenAid hand mixers to the US. For the previous six years, a contractor in Huizhou, South China's Guangdong province, made them.

Company Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Fettig said in order to fulfill the company's commitment to produce in the US and cater to local customers' needs, Whirlpool decided to move some product lines back to the US.

The shift created a net gain of about 25 job opportunities in the US, the Wall Street Journal reported. In contrast to Whirlpool's total 68,000 employees across the world, the figure is tiny.

General Electric Co plans to invest $1 billion by 2014 to upgrade product lines and create new factories for items not previously made in the US. The company is about to add hundreds of employees to its sprawling Appliance Park operations in Louisville, Kentucky, this year.

Similar moves by Otis Elevator Co, Caterpillar Inc and Ford Motor Co, have created a few thousand more positions in the US.

The examples above may be just a beginning. According to findings by the Boston Consulting Group, more than a third of US-based manufacturing executives at companies with sales greater than $1 billion are planning to bring back production to the US from China - or are considering it.

BCG predicted that improved US competitiveness and rising costs in China will put the US in a strong position to add 2 to 3 million jobs in a range of industries and an estimated $100 billion in annual output by the end of the decade.

Companies in seven industries - transportation goods, appliances and electrical equipment, furniture, plastic and rubber products, machinery, fabricated metal products and computers and electronics, are most likely to be among the first to bring back production to the US, according to the BCG report.

It predicts approximately 5-15 percent of goods that the US imports from China could shift to the US before the end of the decade.

After a 35 percent decline in the number of manufacturing jobs between 1998 and 2010, an American manufacturing renaissance may help the US to restore some lost jobs. The number of manufacturing jobs will climb 3.2 percent this year compared with a 1.6 percent increase in all jobs, according to research firm IHS Global Insight.

Labor costs

The rising cost of labor in China is one of the main reasons that prompted US companies to rethink its manufacturing choices. In the BCG survey conducted in February, 92 percent of respondents said they believe that pay in China ""will continue to escalate"" and 70 percent agreed that ""sourcing in China is more costly than it looks on paper"".

Foxconn Technology Group, which manufactures Apple's iPhones and iPads, said in February that it would raise the wages of its Chinese workers by 16 to 25 percent, with monthly pay starting from 1,800 yuan ($286). It is the third pay increase by the company since 2010, when the monthly salary was 900 yuan.

According to the 2012 Asia Pacific Salary Budget Planning Survey issued by Towers Watson, a human resource consultant, respondents from China are planning to increase wages by 8.8 percent this year, while some developed markets such as Singapore and Japan are budgeting salary increases of about 3 to 5 percent.

In contrast to China, US employers are likely to cut costs - because of falling energy prices.

Analysts estimated that the US is going to benefit greatly from its rich reserves of shale gas, an alternative energy, and its early exploration work in the field, which helped the nation become the top producer globally of the resource.

An analysis by PwC consultants found that full-scale and robust shale gas development would likely have a number of knock-on effects for the manufacturing sector in the US, reducing natural gas expenses by as much as $11.6 billion annually through 2025.

William Strauss, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said the boom has meant US electricity prices are the lowest of any industrial nation in the world. The development could help the country lure back work sent to Asia over the years where low-cost labor has been the attraction.

Strauss said labor is still cheaper overseas but the total production costs can be higher after allowing for energy bills and the cost of shipping goods across the Pacific Ocean.

US manufacturing companies could employ approximately 1 million more workers by 2025 due to benefits from affordable energy and demand for products used to extract the gas, the PwC report said.

Costs are not the only factor in the equation. US politicians and corporate leaders have made repeated calls for the shift to inject vitality into the stagnant US economy.

Andrew Liveris, chairman and chief executive officer of Dow, one of the biggest manufacturing companies in the US, said in a speech at Michigan State University last year that innovation follows manufacturing closely and, without production, the US will gradually lose its source of innovation.

""Why should it matter that my iPad says 'built in China' when it also says 'designed in California'?"" asked Liveris. If you outsource it, other countries start making devices, build research and development centers and universities around that industry to generate the human and intellectual capital to sustain it, upgrade it and then design the next generation of devices, he said.

""So you start by outsourcing production... and end up outsourcing creativity,"" he added, saying that, at the same time, it hurt the home market because one ""cannot sustain innovations in locations without a production base"".

China still attractive

It is clear that changes are afoot for the ""Made-in-China"" model, but there is no massive production shift from China to other developed countries so far. China remains a favored investment destination for companies in the US, Europe and Japan, analysts said.

Susan Helper, an economics professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, said that factors such as energy costs are making the US a more attractive place for manufacturers, but the numbers of jobs coming back to the US from Asia and Mexico have been small.

""What we have seen is when there is a new plant to be opened, management are now thinking where it should be, instead of automatically choosing China as the default decision,"" David Lee, a partner at BCG and head of the firm's China industrial goods business, said.

Geoff Li, a spokesman for GE, said GE emphasized both China and the US for manufacturing operations.

""As a technology-driven company, our decisions to invest in manufacturing, service and innovation centers are driven by a number of factors,"" he wrote in an email reply to China Daily. These include local market potential, GE's ability to service large local customers, the suitability of skills and education, the physical infrastructure and the legal and policy environment.

China is one of the most important manufacturing bases for GE and the company will maintain its overall manufacturing presence in China with expansion plans for some businesses, he said.

Sweden's Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson, the world's biggest telecom equipment maker, started manufacturing in China in 1992 and has built its largest production and supply hub in the world in the Eastern Chinese city of Nanjing.

About 40 percent of Ericsson's total global equipment is made in Nanjing. Melody Li, spokeswoman for Ericsson China, said Ericsson has found no reasons to shift manufacturing to its home market or other developed economies.

""We have benefited from the complete industry chain and sufficient capabilities of our suppliers in China's Yangtze River delta and Pearl River delta,"" Li said.

China's neighbor, Japan, also invests heavily in China's manufacturing industry, especially in cameras. Canon Inc, Sony and Nikon all have production plants in China.

""The US call for a manufacturing renaissance may affect China as a global manufacturing center, but the effect is very limited,"" said Wang Haifeng, director of international economics at the Institute for International Economic Research, which is affiliated to the National Development and Reform Commission.

The US advantages lie in middle- to high-end manufacturing, such as precision instruments, aviation and the telecommunications sectors, rather than in what China is specialized at now, he said.

""It is not likely that the low-end labor intensive manufacturing will go back to developed countries because it is not their comparative advantage nor what they are good at,"" he added.

The center of the global manufacturing industry has moved three times in the past centuries, according to Chen Wenling, chief economist with the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, a top think-tank.

The center used to be in Europe, mainly in the United Kingdom, Germany and France, with UK-made goods taking up two-thirds of global manufacturing volumes in the middle of the 19th century. The US then overtook Europe by World War I and, when World War II was over, US foreign trade volumes accounted for more than one-third of the world's total.

Asian dragons

The second transfer took place from the 1960s to the 1980s when Japan and the ""Four Asian Dragons"", referring to the highly developed economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, replaced the US as the global manufacturing center. Japan then became the biggest producer of vehicles, steel and fiber.

That was followed by a gradual transfer of manufacturing to emerging markets, including China, India, Brazil and Russia. China, known as the world's factory for a long time, accounted for about 20 percent of global manufacturing in 2010.

If production returns to developed countries and even cheaper nations such as Vietnam and Indonesia, the manufacturing sector in China will face challenges.

The good news is China's manufacturing is also moving up the value chain, said Wang Haifeng at the Institute for International Economic Research. He recalled in the past that China mainly assembled imported parts of a product because it was unable to make the parts on its own. But now it can make a large number of things it couldn't in the past, for example, optical glass.

Meanwhile, China has its own advantages in attracting manufacturing businesses. The country will continue to be a manufacturing hub for many sectors, such as electronics, Lee at BCG said.

Take mobile phone production as an example. China is the world's biggest manufacturing base for the devices. The nation shipped more than 1.13 billion handsets in 2011, accounting for about 71 percent of the total number in the world, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.

In the southern coastal city of Shenzhen alone, approximately 70 percent of made-in-China mobile phones were manufactured, said Sun Wenping, secretary-general of the Shenzhen Mobile Communications Association.

""It is because of the unparalleled mobile-device production chain in China that no other countries can compete with it. Suppliers for mobile phone parts are almost next door,"" Sun said.

Unlike Apple, which probably takes a year to research and test a new model, Shenzhen's mobile-phone manufacturers have a much higher productivity rate.

""From the idea to the actual product hitting the market, the fastest Shenzhen producers only need 20 days,"" Sun said.

One of the country's most iconic painters, Wang Yidong emphasizes both technique and tradition. Zhang Zixuan reports in Beijing.

The bride's red quilted jacket and trousers stand out among the blue and gray-colored throng, enlivening the snowy mountain scene. As a child growing up in the Yimeng Mountain area of Shandong province, artist Wang Yidong memorized this scene and has repeatedly portrayed the girl in red on canvas. For example, at the upcoming 2012 Chinese Oil Painting Art Exhibition in London, Wang portrays a teenage girl in a red vest eating a ripe pomegranate. The painting's name, The Pomegranate is Ripe, is a play on words that indicates the girl's coming of age. The 57-year-old recalls the poverty of his hometown by recounting the story of his fifth uncle's wedding, when the fish dish at the center of the table was an imitation made of wood, with a coating of real sauce. But the country's leading Realistic artist believes poverty actually preserves tradition, which he defines as the ""thick accretion of culture"". Wang's relatives and his rural mountain scenes, and especially girls from the countryside in red clothes, have become the painter's signature subjects.

""I am a man. There is nothing more natural than appreciating feminine beauty,"" he says.

Wang's exceptional painting skills are due in part to seven years of training at Shandong Art School and then the Central Academy of Fine Arts during the 1970s and 1980s.

And even though he is aware of the huge variety of contemporary art forms, Wang sticks to Realism.

He rejects the idea of distancing himself from his audience and refuses to ""be manipulated by the market or trends of thought"".

""Painting can never abandon technique,"" he says, adding that great artworks touch the viewer because the underlying technique is outstanding.

Wang says the more he paints, the more difficult Realism is, for him.

Even so, he admits that despite the time and effort he spends on painting a Realistic work, viewers tend to be more critical because they can relatively easily detect the flaws.

""Those few of us who still pursue Realism are somewhat crazy,"" he observes.

Wang does not slavishly copy reality, however. He places realistic figures in imagined backgrounds, which seem real but have actually been ""absolutized in terms of various emotional needs"".

For instance, in some of his works that portray a snowy background, big black and white lumps of color are used, borrowing from the abstract technique of traditional Chinese ink painting.

Meanwhile, the emotions of his painted figures can easily be read, such as the bride's anxiety before the wedding, or a village girl's yearning for the outside world.

""Wang is trying to create the sense of abstract in a realistic image. Such abstraction reflects the purity of art, and somehow adds a bitter flavor to the work,"" comments artist Zhu Naizheng.

Wang admires Western artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Ingres and Vermeer, but he dares to question these masters and imitates their techniques in a selective way.

His one-year stay in the United States in 1987 and later overseas visits have convinced him that ""even if techniques can be fully adopted from the West, nothing else can"".

""I need to refine the subject out of my original culture,"" he says.

So Wang paints the Chinese red color of the village girl's quilted jacket and trousers in Western Realistic strokes. And he travels in rural North China and culturally similar places to his hometown, to seek further inspiration.

Art Magazine's Executive Editor-in-Chief Shang Hui describes this approach as ""expressing Chinese human interest by the understanding of European Classicsm's aesthetic principles"".

And it has been a successful approach. Wang's artworks have been exhibited in many countries and set records at auctions - but he is still ambitious.

""I have so many paintings to complete,"" he says.

His newest project features a huge rural wedding of more than 100 figures in Shanxi's Taihang Mountain area.

As a ""rehearsal"" for the painting that will have ""intense sunshine"", Wang spent one month in France and did more than 40 paintings in Provence, which is famed for its natural light.

The 3.5-meter-long and 1.8-meter-high work is expected to be finished by 2014.

""It will be my largest painting,"" he says.

A mountain cave in China that was once the headquarters of a communist leader killed in a mysterious plane crash has been converted into a bizarre military-themed bar.

First-time visitors to the quirky bar on the outskirts of Beijing could be forgiven for thinking they had stumbled across the scene of a disaster, as the fuselage of an aircraft has been used to create a startling entrance to the former bunker.



The cave was the military headquarters of Lin Biao, a prominent figure in China's Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and '70s who worked alongside communist Chairman Mao Zedong.

Chairman Mao tried to rid China of anybody opposed to his communist ideology.

Lin Biao was killed when his plane crashed in Mongolia in 1971, soon after what appeared to be a failed coup int ended to oust Chairman Mao.

The death of the once influential general remains a mystery, but shortly after he was killed he was officially denounced as a traitor by the Communist Party of China.

The new bar has been decorated with military hardware, communist flags, and portraits of Lin Biao and Chairman Mao.

Part of the bar in Lin Biao's former headquarters has been decorated to look like a 'war room'; featuring maps, portraits of communist icons, and a long table perfect for plotting military manoeuvres

Visitors will be able to enjoy a drink surrounded by guns and helmets in the unique bar in China, beneath a portrait of the communist military leader Lin Biao

Old parachutes hang above tables inside the military-themed bar, and the walls have been given a camouflage effect inspired by army uniforms

Military equipment including guns, parachutes, sandbags and helmets have been used to decorate seating areas in the unique venue.

Lin Biao was instrumental in creating the foundations for Chairman Mao's cult of personality in China in the 1960s, where propaganda was used to create an idealised image of the communist leader.

The pair worked closely together during the Cultural Revolution, a political campaign that Mao believed would unsettle the 'ruling class', keeping China in a state of 'perpetual revolution' that served the interests of the majority, rather than the elite.



Millions of people in China were forced into manual labour during the Cultural Revolution, and tens of thousands were executed.

Mao chose Lin Biao as his successor during this period, but by 1971 a divide was apparent between the two.

Lin died in September of that year when his plane crashed in Mongolia, following an apparent attempt to unseat Chairman Mao.

Little information about the incident is available to the public, and the circumstances surrounding Lin Biao's death have been the subject of speculation among China scholars ever since.

The cave that was once home to Lin's military headquarters will no doubt be popular with tourists eager to sample a drink in one of the world's most unusual watering holes.

Other famously bizarre bars include Hobbit House in Manila, in the Philippines, which is inspired by the tales of J.R.R. Tolkien and staffed entirely by dwarves.

The Huaxi National Wetland Park is described as a magnificent “diamond” inlaid in Huaxi, the “brilliant pearl plateau”.

In December 2009, Huaxi Wetland Park was formally approved as the first National Wetland Park in southwest China. Located in Huaxi proper, in Guiyang, the Park mainly boasts such scenic spots as Huaxi Park, Huaxi Shilihe Beach, and Dajiangshan Park, and so on. It was built in March 2010, and has been open to the public since September 6, 2011.

The wetland park, featuring rivers, farmlands and ponds, provides a safe place for animals to eat, live and breed. It also creates favorable conditions for carrying out scientific research activities in the wetland park. According to statistics, there are 495 kinds of vascular plants, two of which are the second-class national protection category (cultivated species are excluded), and three kinds of precious animals protected by the state.

Huaxi River in the wetlands is known as the “No. 1 Love River of China”. With its sufficient high quality water, it has become the main supplier of water for domestic use by Guiyang citizens. It has flood plains scattered on both banks, with water flowing gently along the winding river course of 20 bends.

In recent years, the Guiyang municipal government has carried out a variety of large tree-planting activities, and attracted more than 20,000 Green Ribbon volunteers to take part in the construction and management of the wetland park. Since its establishment, it has functioned as a new place of leisure for citizens.

Admission Tickets:

1. The Shilihe Beach: Free

2. Huaxi Park: 8:00-18:30: Adult: RMB 6; Children: RMB 3; After 18:30: Free

Location:

The Huaxi National Wetland Park is located at Huaxi, south of Guiyang, merely 12 kilometers away from the downtown area of the city. The Park is next to Huaxi Highway, the urban expressway.

Re: ""Belonging: An offer they can't refuse"" (Commentary, July 22).

I have often asked the same question Khun Voranai Vanijaka asked in his latest article on the red shirts: ""Why do they (United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship) do the things that they do?"" And we have come to the same conclusion. No matter their backgrounds, people want respect and their voices heard. If one red shirt protested, his voice would be unheard and ignored. But if they formed a large group, using their sheer numbers as leverage to demand political changes, they are are a force to be reckoned with. Furthermore, the need to belong is deeply rooted in the human psyche. Having a group wearing the same colour with the same goals furnishes a sense of belonging and gives meaning to people's lives. It also gives them a common identity.

Growing up in an egalitarian society in Australia, I did not see much denigration of those who came from outer provinces or worked as labourers and blue-collar workers. If anything the labourers such as plumbers and electricians are often better paid than university lecturers because of the low supply of the former. This, however, is not the case in Thailand.

Due to the feudalistic mentality analogous to the ''caste system'' we have in Thailand, there is a huge divide between the Bangkokians who are typically pro-establishment versus the majority of Thais living in the provinces and rural areas. Many Bangkokians I have come across look down upon the red shirts with contempt _ believing that they are ill-informed and easily manipulated. I doubt this is the right attitude for true reconciliation. True reconciliation cannot and will not be achieved in parliament. Rather, it must come from a change of mentality and attitude by Thais. Regardless of the other person's educational background, wealth, occupation, place of birth, skin colour and age, Thais must learn how to sincerely respect one another as equals. Arguably this is the biggest cultural challenge that Thais must face if the country is to truly reconcile and succeed in the globalised era. Sadly, I might be asking too much.

Generals value only face

To me, it seems that our generals value saving face more than the lives of their men, as shown by the GT200 and Alpha 6 bomb detectors. A total of 1,576 of these detectors were bought by 13 agencies, with the Ordinance Department being the biggest buyer, putting out 300 million baht of your money and mine to buy 697 GT200 units.

Our Ministry of Science and Technology tested the GT200 and Alpha 6 many times, and found that they had a one in five chance of being successful in detecting a bomb. That's like having our bomb squads play Russian roulette every day, with four of the five chambers in their revolvers loaded. They'd have a far higher chance of living if they flipped a coin.

Yet, Defence Minister Sukumpol Suwanatat and Supreme Commander Tanasak Patimapakorn insist that the devices are effective, and they continue to be used.

For the generals to about-face and admit that they've been scammed would make them lose a lot of face. It would also open the way for an unwanted investigation by the National Anti-Corruption Commission - especially since it was ACM Sukumpol who was responsible for the purchase (when he was air force chief of staff).

How sad that our generals seem to place their personal interests above their men's lives. How sad, too, that neither the Pheu Thai Party nor the red shirts, who claim to represent the lowly enlisted men whose lives are daily at stake in the deep South, don't raise a stink about it - and neither do you, dear reader, even though those men are dying for you.

No flood experts in China

A BBC home page headline last night read: ''Deadly Beijing floods prompt infrastructure questions.'' In light of the Chinese questioning their own government's ability to handle flood problems, why does the Thai government insist on consulting ''China flood control experts?'' After reading the BBC report, I doubt if Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra would still consult the Chinese over anything about flood control.

Since Eastman Kodak declared bankruptcy, the price of film has soared. Does this spell the end of the old-timer artform, the next to be elbowed aside by the digital world?

A growing number of film lovers who cling to lomo cameras say no.

""Film is not going to die. On the contrary, it may thrive as we are developing various lomo cameras and new types of inexpensive films to cultivate a market where one can realize the mix of old and new,"" said Liu Qiang, manager of the Beijing Lomography store.

Lomography, a company that sells plastic retro cameras, landed in Beijing five years ago after it took over such metropolitan centers of art as New York, and opened its second chain store one year later.

It did not take a long time before the cameras were embraced by amateur and professional Chinese photographers alike not only for their fashionable looks but also for their off-kilter, blurry and color-soaked effects.

""Lomo cameras have the kind of sizes and looks that you just want to put them into the pocket and take them everywhere you go. They are nothing like the bulky digital single lens reflex (DSLR) cameras,"" Wang Yang, a 29-year-old Beijing native, said.

Wang had been using the digital cameras for more than seven years before his friends lent him a Super Sampler, a lomo camera that can produce four successive images on one negative, three years ago.

""I was fascinated by the dreamlike images as soon as I got the film developed. The lo-fi artworks are anything but perfect, but they created an instant haze of memory,"" Wang said.

The digital cameras may seem less flawed or simply easier, but they sacrifice warmth, soul, depth, personality, chance and the human touch for their cleaner images. ""The newer thing boasts 100 percent accuracy and correctness, but life is nothing like that,"" said Meng Yalei, chief editor of Holga Freak, an e-magazine that focuses on international lomographers.

""That's why the young people love lomo cameras because they can use them to draw their own reality,"" Meng said.

They must have a point, because the antiquated creative process has inspired some digital filters on cell phones and computers to mimic lomo cameras' effects.

The Hipsamatic iPhone application is one of them. The filter can make the pictures look as though they were taken with the unreliable plastic lomo cameras.

""Lomo effects are very popular nowadays. The lomography-style pictures can not only created by cell phone applications but also be found in the designs of posters, websites and magazines,"" Bai Luoman, a 29-year-old photographer, said.

""Lomo has become more of a buzz word than simply a kind of camera,"" Bai said.

Lomo Wedding Consultant, a wedding planning company at Sanlitun in Beijing, picked the name for the very reason.

""Lomo to us means 'let our life be magic and open' and the lomo cameras are renowned for their uniquely beautiful images. That's exactly what we want to do for our clients— to plan a dreamlike, one-of-kind wedding,"" said Li Ji, the store owner. ""Besides, everybody knows the word.""

The store's wall is decorated by hundreds of small photos of the newlyweds. Li said it is a trend to piece together the photos taken by lomo cameras to create a lomo wall. ""The young people just love it.""

""People always say film will eventually disappear. But I think things do not necessarily have to die out if we keep instilling new and creative thoughts into them and make them a culture trend that is full of fun. Just like lomography."" Wang Yang pressed the shutter of his lomo.

""Invention always has its own way,"" he said.

Accompanied by heavy rains, a central pressure of 950 millibars, and 10-minute sustained winds of 80 knots (170 km/h [106 mph]) according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), Vicente made landfall as a strong Category 2 typhoon.

Prior to landfall, the Hong Kong Observatory issued its No. 10 hurricane signal – the highest for the city – for the first time since 1999, when Typhoon York made a direct hit on the region. AIR said that “due to the relatively low levels of damage that have been reported thus far,” it does not anticipate significant insured losses from Vicente.

Dr. Peter Sousounis, senior principal atmospheric scientist at AIR Worldwide, described “high winds and heavy rains,” which “felled up to 1,000 trees in the city, and flood damage.” However he indicated that “apart from this, Vicente’s rapidly diminishing winds are expected to have caused limited damage to roof and wall claddings of poorly constructed homes and commercial structures, and very little damage to well-built structures, within Hong Kong.”

“Farther inland on the Pearl River Delta, Guangdong, which is a major city in Guangzhou Province, received less damage primarily because it experienced much weaker winds. These weaker winds were the result of winds blowing from a direction even farther inland – a much rougher transit.”

Dr. Sousounis noted that the storm continued on a westerly course with “maximum sustained winds of 44.7 mph [71.5 mph], and has been downgraded to a tropical storm. Its center is now located about 260 kilometers (161.5 miles) west of Hong Kong. The storm is forecast to continue moving west-northwest through Guangdong Province, and cross over into Guangxi province. Although Vicente continues to weaken, it has the potential to dump 12 inches of rain in Guangxi province. Authorities have evacuated more than 42,000 people in the Guangdong city of Maoming, in the event of flash flooding and mudslides that might result from the anticipated heavy rains there.”

AIR pointed out that “Vicente had a short life. It formed on July 20th east of the Philippines and then tracked westward across Northern Luzon but stalled for a 24-hour period from July 22-23rd, which gave it time to intensify over warm water. By July 23rd, Vicente had achieved a central pressure of 950 millibars and reached its maximum intensity of 105 mph (1-minute sustained) winds. Early in its life, Vicente helped to supply the moisture that fueled the Beijing floods over the weekend.

“Vicente is expected to continue west-northwest through southern China, and may cause additional heavy rains in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces as it progresses. Although Vicente has had a notable impact on travel, communications, and businesses, Hong Kong escaped serious damage.”

Spurious drugs and unhygienic food items are being sold in Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B) without any hindrance, putting lives of local people at risk, health experts say.





Many people fall ill because of consumption of these adulterated food items from down country which are flooding the local markets, while health officials look the other way.Talking to The Express Tribune, Baltistan Doctors Forum (BDF) Chairman Dr Sharif Astori said that in a recent camp set up in Gilgit by Polyclinic Hospital Islamabad, a large number of people were found to be in poor health.Adults suffered from high blood pressure, prostate gland diseases and thyroid and gynaecological disorders, while waterborne diseases and intestinal parasites were common among children.“The people are getting sick because of what they are consuming,” said Dr Astore, adding that the substandard drugs and packed food items that have flooded markets in G-B are playing a significant role in this regard.He said that substandard packed food items such as spices, biscuits, powdered milk and cooking oil as well as drugs manufactured illegally in Swat and Peshawar, or those allegedly manufactured in China and Indian and smuggled through Afghanistan, are being sold openly in G-B’s markets. He claimed the drugs as well as the packed food items are of substandard quality and pose a serious health risk to consumers.“These items directly affect kidneys, liver, stomach and heart of the consumer,” said Astori, adding that people can develop fatal diseases by consuming these drugs and food items. He said that it is the government’s duty to keep check on the quality of drugs and food items and urged the health department to remove all spurious drugs and food items from markets.Moreover, the BDF chairman said there is severe shortage of medical staff in G-B, adding that there are only 200 doctors to cater to a population of 2.5 million. He said that there are very few female doctors for women patients.“There is a shortage of health professionals because they are reluctant to go to G-B,” Dr Astori reasoned.He said that the government does not provide them salaries on time and they are not even given any incentives for working away from home. Majority of the lower staff do not even get salaries and find it difficult to continue their profession, he added.Dr Astori maintained that Rs257 million allocated for G-B’s health sector is “insufficient”. He said there are no medical facilities available for cancer patients in G-B and they are forced to travel to Islamabad or Rawalpindi for treatment, which many of them cannot afford. Hospitals also lack basic medical equipment such as CT scan and MRI machines, he said. He added that due to lack of health professionals in remote areas, the locals resort to home remedies for severe illnesses and many die as a result.Shifa International Hospital (SIH)’s Urologist Dr Ijaz Hussian said that despite lack of health facilities, the government has still slashed the health budget by up to Rs16 million. With only on one secondary care hospital in G-B, that reduction in the health budget has made it impossible for hospitals to facilitate every patient, he said.He said that around 18,000 patients visit hospitals in G-B annually of which around 16,000 get admitted.Dr Hussain added that unhealthy lifestyles and lack of awareness about nutrition contributes to the deteriorating health of people in G-B.Published in The Express Tribune, July 23, 2012.","Mon, 23 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",http://i1.tribune.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/411803-FoodPHOTOFILE-1343008135.jpg,"['flood', 'dr', 'woes', 'health', 'substandard', 'spurious', 'gb', 'lack', 'packed', 'astori', 'food', 'unhygienic', 'items', 'markets', 'drugs']",

The 'Rude Boy' singer has been rocked by the loss of her beloved grandparent Clara 'Dolly' Braithwaite on June 30, and is hoping she will send her some sort of message from the afterlife to let her know she is still watching over her.

Referring to her by her nickname, she tweeted: ""I wish u were here ... Got so many questions and you always had answers #grangranDOLLY

""Send a message in the wind or something please #grangranDOLLY (sic)""

Rihanna is reported to be spending time with ex-boyfriend Chris Brown in the South of France and her desire to speak to 'Dolly' could come from her need for advice on whether she should get involved again with the man who brutally assaulted in February 2009.

Rihanna cancelled her appearance at the Rock In Rio festival in Madrid, Spain, and flew back to her native Barbados to be with her mother Monica after the death of her grandmother.

She then attended both funeral services held for Clara, one in New York and another in Barbados.

Rihanna frequently talks to her passed grandparent directly in her tweets, paying tribute after her passing by writing: ""Goodbye grangranDolly get your beauty rest until I see you. grangranDolly that is all. (sic)""

Before her Barbados funeral, she wrote: ""grangranDolly time for your party in Barbados. (sic)""

Rihanna has become increasingly spiritual in her tweets since 'Dolly' died, writing yesterday: ""I put it all in Your hands!!! I love my Creator!!!! #1Love #1Life (sic).""

By Ye Jun ( China Daily)

Salted tieguanyin (oolong) leaves are served with deep-fried shrimps at the restaurant.

It was going to happen sooner or later. The idea of using tea leaves or tea infusions in food is so intriguing that many chefs have adopted it. Ye Jun looks at an increasingly popular trend in modern Chinese cuisine.

The idea of combining tea with food may be tempting but it is precisely its special characteristics that make it so hard to succeed. It was inevitable that a top class restaurant in a top class hotel in Beijing would play with the idea. Take Jewel Chinese Restaurant at the Westin Beijing Financial Street for instance. It recently pushed a new menu featuring 16 dishes using more than 10 types of tea.

Many of the major Chinese tea varieties were used, ranging from green tea, the semi-fermented oolong, jasmine tea, and aged pu'er. Infusions such as chrysanthemum and kuding were also included.

Chinese cuisine has long included classics with tea as a main ingredient. In the Hangzhou area, prawns with longjing (dragon well) tea leaves have been on the menu for hundreds of years. Shelled prawns that have been massaged in clear cold water are then fried in an intensely fragrant tea infusion with green tea leaves.

The tea produced in Hangzhou, harvested just before the Tomb-Sweeping Festival rain, is known for its chestnut-like aroma which gives the dish its distinctive taste.

Another classic dish using tea comes from Sichuan, where black tea leaves and camphor wood chips are used to smoke a duck, creating zhangcha ya, or camphor tea duck. The smoking cuts through the grease under the duck skin and the meat is turned a beautiful golden amber, with an appetizing smoky musk.

It is upon these foundations that Beijing's Chinese restaurants are trying to create new tea dishes. There have been hits and misses.

The flavor of tea is hard to capture and the dishes do not fully absorb that elusive fragrance.

Tea leaves added to the dish are sometimes more ornamental. There have been some attempts to coat the leaves in batter and fry them, but the results have been greasy and disappointing.

So it is that the chefs at Jewel must have spent considerable time slaving over their new menu. And they have done a good job at conquering the odds.

Dishes look good, taste good and in most of the dishes, you can taste the tea.

A classic Huaiyang-style chicken soup with water shield is nicely garnished with a few chrysanthemum petals floating in the bowl. The petals are infused to extract their full flavor and you can taste the characteristic bitter-sweet of the flowers.

Salted tieguanyin (oolong) leaves are served with deep-fried shrimps, and the dish is done better than elsewhere. The shrimps are done to a crisp without losing flavor, and the tea leaves too add to the crunch.

In the wok-fried sliced beef with bitter melon and kuding, the bitter tea nicely matches the bitter vegetable while the three-cup chicken with pu'er is excellent with a bowl of rice. But the strong tastes of the sauces overwhelmed the pu'er and kuding leaves, and you need a really sensitive palate to detect the traces.

Perhaps it is due to the properties of tea, but both these dishes tasted less oily than usual.

However, it was really hard to detect tea in both the poached clams and steamed sea bass - if not for the tea leaves garnishes.

Glutinous rice balls with pu'er tea or green tea for dessert showcased the teas best, although they were a tad too sweet for me.

Jewel Chinese Restaurant sous chef Cai Guangmin says he likes tieguanyin, an oolong tea produced in southern Fujian's Anxi. He says he surfed the Internet to research the properties of various teas before deciding what ingredients worked best in the dishes.

""I think the bold flavors of pu'er will match the strong-tasting three-cup chicken,"" he says. ""On the other hand, the bitter taste of kuding goes well with bitter melon, and can also beat the heat and reduce dryness in summer.""

For both dishes, he soaked the tea leaves in hot water, and then pours the infusion into the dish, reducing the sauce before serving.

Cai says tea dishes offer the same benefits as tea drinking, and the teas will reduce the grease in the food, and help the body digest a meal better.

He has experimented with tea in different forms, using leaves, infusion and powder.

Zou Jun, director of operations with Mingjia Yaji, a company dealing with tea, says different teas are suitable for different cooking methods.

""Green tea is suitable for plain frying, and used in light, vegetable dishes. Black tea can be used for roasting, marinating and smoking. Matured pu'er has a dark color and strong taste, and is better used for seasoning in red-braised dishes,"" he says.

""Oolong teas such as dahongpao (Fujian's famous Big Red Robe tea), is similar to black tea, and tieguanyin is similar to green tea, and can be used likewise.""

Taiwan was the first in China to design a complete set of tea dishes in the 1980s, according to Zou.

One dish that was very popular for a time was duck or pork rib soup with Taiwan's baozhong oolong, in which the amino acid in the tea emphasizes the freshness of the meats. Later, black tea was used to roast pigeon in another dish.

By the 1990s, innovative Chinese chefs in Sichuan, Huaiyang and Hangzhou created more tea dishes, one step up from the Taiwan inventions.

Zou, who graduated from the Tea Department of Zhejiang University, says Shanghai's Qiuping Tea Banquet was the first specialized restaurant in Chinese mainland to offer tea cuisine when it was founded in 1994.

The restaurant produced a West Lake tea banquet featuring Chinese teas of different colors: green, white, yellow, dark green, red and black.

Owner Liu Qiuping pairs the tea dishes with beautiful lines of ancient Chinese poetry. She uses tea instead of ordinary seasoning such as cooking wine, aniseed, and Sichuan peppercorns.

In Beijing, people can sample tea cuisine in restaurants such as Green T. House, and Wu Yu Tai Tea Restaurant. Many restaurants in big star hotels also offer some.

Zou thinks tea dishes presently cater to a minority of aficionados and that it will be quite some time before a more matured tea cuisine is developed.

""In the past 10 years or more, only 20 to 30 creative tea dishes have withstood the test of time,"" he says. ""They are more for special occasions rather than for every day consumption.""

Tea infusions are volatile, making it hard to withstand high cooking temperatures, and so are best used for cold dishes. The exception is when the tea is concentrated into essence, like what is used in some noodle restaurants in Taiwan.

""Creating new tea dishes takes a lot of creativity on the part of the chef, who must have a very good understanding of both tea and ingredients,"" Zou says. ""It just needs more time.""","Sun, 22 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20120722/00221910da6c11759e9007.jpg,"['chinese', 'dish', 'dishes', 'green', 'tea', 'used', 'restaurant', 'leaves', 'puer', 'teas']",

There's nothing more elegant or fashionable than a qipao, and while they are not as popular as they used to be they still have their dedicated followers. Tiffany Tan finds out why in Shanghai and Beijing.

Women unwinding on a weekend usually dress in jeans, shorts or a skirt and a T-shirt. Not Zhao Jing. The 27-year-old from Beijing dons a qipao to visit a park, drop by the supermarket or make tea at home. The figure-hugging traditional dress, with its distinctive mandarin collar and slit skirt, puts Zhao in an indulgent state of mind.

""In this kind of city, you work like crazy every day,"" says the Anhui province native, who is account and venue manager at a Beijing cultural exchange center. ""When you're wearing a qipao, you feel like you don't need to hurry back home to cook or do other chores. You just enjoy the moment and relax.""

Zhao began to regularly wear the dress - known as ""cheongsam"" in Cantonese-derived English - back in college, about 10 years ago. She now has six dresses in her collection.

Wang Weiyu, on the other hand, has almost nine times as many.

For the past five years, the traditional dress has become everyday wear for the Shanghai retiree, who conducts etiquette classes in local communities.

Among her 52 qipao, she has one with a slit at the back, instead of at the sides, made especially for cycling. She has cotton and linen qipao for running errands, woolen versions for winter and luxurious silk numbers for formal occasions.

She has the dress in solid colors, plaids, stripes, polka dots, tiny and bold floral patterns, traditional prints, lace, as well as embroidered and hand-painted designs. And of course, there are her denim pieces, which provide some insight into why she has become a major qipao advocate.

""Denim qipao are innovative and can attract the interest of young people,"" Wang, 63, says one rainy summer afternoon in her home in the southwestern suburbs of Shanghai.

""You are Chinese and have your own heritage. You cannot forget your traditional, ethnic culture Even if you're wearing international brand names from head to toe, your hair has been dyed blond and your eyes are colored blue, you're still Chinese. This cannot be changed.""

In 2007, Wang established the Shanghai Cheongsam Salon to promote qipao use. The group's activities include an annual assembly, talks and trips around China and overseas - with all members decked out in their traditional attire, of course.

From an initial 40 women, the group's numbers have since grown tenfold. (The average age of members is 55, only 5 percent of the group is 30 years old and younger.)

Many of the members come from Shanghai and its neighboring cities of Suzhou and Hangzhou. Lately, Wang says, there has also been interest from women in northern cities like Beijing, Harbin and Xi'an, as well as southern cities like Guangzhou and Shenzhen.

The group now wants to bring this awareness to the next level: It's trying to garner government support to declare May 20 as national ""qipao day"".

""The first time salon members gathered for Chinese tea, and this was still within the community, not far from where we lived,"" Wang says. ""More than half the women carried their qipao in their bags.

""They didn't dare wear them out on the streets. When they got to the teahouse, then they changed clothes. I teased them, saying, 'So what if I wear a qipao to go out? Will the police arrest me?'""

It may be a joke, but it's also a reflection of the qipao's changing fortunes in Chinese society.

The dress - a fusion of the sleeveless long vests and long-sleeved lined jackets of the late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) - was popularized by Shanghai women in the 1920s. The earliest styles were actually relatively loose; they became tighter at the waist due to Western-tailoring influences in the '30s.

During that decade and the next, the dress became the height of Chinese fashion. It was worn by ordinary citizens, as well as movie stars and intellectuals. It served both as casual and formal wear and was paired with imported articles of clothing, like fur coats, shawls and sweaters.

But it went by the wayside in the '60s and '70s, when Communist revolutionary zeal swept China. The qipao, which was associated with bourgeois culture, vanished from public life.

In the '80s, following the country's ""reform and opening-up"", the dress reappeared. Since then, however, it has been worn mainly on special occasions, like wedding banquets, Spring Festival celebrations and international events.

""Present-day Chinese have long been looking for appropriate formal attire,"" says Liu Qi, a lecturer at the Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology and associate curator of the university's Museum of Ethnic Costumes.

""Because of the qipao's prestigious history, especially in the eyes of Westerners, and because it's not far removed from our life, it became Chinese women's first choice,"" she says in an e-mail.

To appeal to more consumers, vendors have begun offering modernized versions of the dress.

At Herderson Metropolitan, a mall on Shanghai's Nanjing Road shopping hub, a ready-to-wear qipao store gives a glimpse of the dress' reincarnations. Instead of the traditional mandarin collar, most of the items have U- and V-shaped, square, scalloped or sweetheart necklines. Some feature an organza overlay that mimics the traditional neckline.

The skirt slit is done away with on the knee-length dresses, and they all zip at the back. Some are empire cut; others are pleated along the bodice. Front overlaps and loop frog buttons are sewn shut and merely serve as decorations.

""Today's Chinese fashion integrates international trends, and people's concepts of beauty have undergone massive changes,"" says Jia Xizeng, a lecturer at Tsinghua University's academy of arts and design, who specializes in ancient Chinese garments.

""Because of the diversity of aesthetic needs, people are no longer transfixed on just one type of clothing,"" he says.

Women like Zhao Jing and Wang Weiyu, who wear their qipao every day or every week, are pretty unusual. It's especially unusual for younger women like Zhao, who came of age in a globalized, Western fashion-dominated world.

But Zhao doesn't mind sticking out in a crowd in her pink high heels and custom-made qipao in salmon pink georgette.

""I don't care if people stare at me,"" she says, holding up the dress in the summer light. ""I just enjoy feeling elegant and carefree.""

The newlyweds were forced to take their vows indoors



They were prepared for the British weather with wellies and umbrellas

The family and bridal party also waded out for photos

There are flood alerts for parts of England and Wales



Even though their wedding venue flooded, this couple were determined the weather would not put a dampener on their big day.



To make light of the rain, Sarah and Mark Camilletti, posed for their photographs armed with umbrellas, wellington boots and towels to make the most of their big day at the waterlogged Hotel Felix in Cambridge.

The bride, 29, and groom, 34, had dreamed of taking their vows among the hotel’s idyllic gardens but were forced to make their lifelong commitments indoors.

Not a dampener: Determined to pose in the garden they dreamt of, bride and groom Sarah and Mark Camilletti put on wellies for their wedding photos

Wet wedding party: Armed with wellies and umbrellas the family and bridal party braved the two foot floods at Hotel Felix in Cambridge

Not letting the deluge dampen their spirit, the bride and groom still headed for the gardens to take their wedding photographs, donning wellies to pose for the camera.

The couple said they were always prepared for the great British weather but didn’t expect to have their wedding in the middle of a lake.

Picturesque punting: Hotel manager Shara Ross said the garden was 'only good for punting' after the heavy rains

Getting hitched: Mrs Camilletti had to hitch up her wedding dress to get to the chairs but her gallant groom carried her back through the knee-high water

Mrs Camilletti said her dreams of a sunlit outdoor ceremony were shattered, but added she ‘could not have imagined anything better’.

She said: ‘We knew it was going to be wet in the run up to it so we brought a whole load of wellies and umbrellas and asked the guests to do the same.

‘It was quite funny when they were arriving in the morning and some of the guests thought there was a lovely lake in the garden.

‘But when they saw the tables and chairs poking out of the middle they realised it wasn’t a lake and that was where we were supposed to have the wedding. The water was knee deep.’

Never wetter: While the couple had hoped for a sunny ceremony, it turned out to be 'better than imagined'

Mrs Camilletti had to hitch up her white dress to wade through the knee deep floodwater to climb onto a romantic bench.

Mr Camilletti braved the two feet floods, with the tails of his morning suit dangling just feet above the murky water.

They were joined by family members, the best man and bridesmaids, who had all been ordered to bring their wellies so the memorable photoshoot could still go ahead.

The groom and one of his friends gallantly carried the giggling bride back to dry land after the muddy memories had been captured.

A duck's day: Making light of the floods, the couple floated rubber ducks complete with wedding attire

Mrs Camilletti, a family support worker at a children’s centre and civil servant at the Ministry of Justice Mark from north London, said the flooding made the occasion.

She said: ‘We could not have imagined anything better.’

They shared their wet wedding day with 100 guests and are now on their honeymoon in Norfolk where they hope the sun will shine.

Shara Ross, general manager of Hotel Felix, said the garden was ‘only good for punting’ after recent heavy rains.

Usually sunshine: Hotel Felix in Cambridge is usually an idyllic location perfect for a wedding

She praised the Camillettis for ‘taking it all in their stride’ when many couples would have ‘completely lost it’.

On the day elsewhere in Cambridge, families battled to save their possessions as floodwater seeped into homes in Girton.

There are currently two flood alerts in place for east England, 21 alerts in other regions and one flood warning in Wales.

It is a find that would have bargain hunters swooning with envy.



After being smothered in dust and forgotten in an old barn, this pair of beautiful bowls were discovered by an eagle-eyed expert looking around a house.

The giant Chinese porcelain fish bowls had been ignored for so long that they were discovered languishing in dust and containing a mummified mouse.

The matching yellow pair were made in the 19th or early 20th century for the last dowager empress of China, Cixi, to keep her goldfish in.



What a find! This giant pair of Chinese porcelain fish bowls, that were made in the 19th or early 20th century for the last dowager empress of China, Cixi, are now to be sold at auction

They are now to be sold at auction and have been given a conservative estimate of £10,000, but are likely to sell for much more.

They come with their original, decorative hardwood stands and were spotted by an expert doing a routine valuation at a house near Colchester, Essex.

The bowls are decorated with peony blossoms and would have be used to keep fish in, possibly at an imperial palace.

They measure 18 by 21 inches and are stamped with the iron-red Dayazhai character mark enclosed within an oval medallion with a dragon border.

James Grinter, from Reeman Dansie’s auction house in Colchester, was the expert who spotted the bowls.

He said: 'I was on a routine valuation and these bowls were in a barn and had clearly been there for many years and were covered in dust.

'In one on them was a dead mouse and it had been there for so long that it had mummified.

'It had obviously fallen in and couldn’t get out again. The bowls were originally used to keep goldfish in.

'They have the mark of the last dowager empress of China, but we can’t say if they were used by her or came from an imperial palace - we’ll let the market decide that.

'They are large bowls and one of them has been restored a long time ago, which is one of the reasons why the estimate is quite low.

'But they come with their Chinese hardwood stands and are striking pieces.'

The bowls will be auctioned at Reeman Dansie's auction house in Colchester

Other eye-watering auctions include a rare Chinese bowl from the Song dynasty which sold for $26.7m (£16.8m) at auction in Hong Kong in April.

The sale of theillion 900-year-old Ruyao washer set a new record for a piece of ceramic from the Song dynasty, Sotheby's auction house said.

Ru ceramics are named after a large kilns that operated at the time and are the rarest in China.

The porcelain pair are going under the hammer on July 31.

Provided to China Daily

After working for eight years, Ji Xingang's bomb-defusing device is now used by many public security bureaus, fire stations, as well as oil and gas companies throughout China. Wang Ru reports.

For eight years, Ji Xingang worked relentlessly on his bomb defusing invention, modifying and improving the device. It was originally a hobby and he never thought it would be put to use. But the timing was perfect. He completed his project in March 2010 and in June 2010, someone from the public security bureau of Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei province, found use for it.

""I was so excited but also nervous when I received the call,"" says the 38-year-old.

The caller needed Ji's device - a mobile water jet cutting machine - to detonate a 1.5-meter-long bomb covered with mud, which was discovered accidentally by an excavator driver while digging. He initially thought it was a rock.

After some investigations, the ammunition expert from Shijiazhuang public security bureau, Wu Yongjin, believed it belonged to the Flying Tigers, a famous American air force group which supported the Chinese army in its fight against the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression (1937-45).

It contained more than 100 kg of chemical explosive or trinitrotoluene.

""If it exploded, the blasting power could raze all the buildings within 600 square meters,"" Wu says. And that included residential buildings, a supermarket and a school.

The conventional way to defuse unexploded bombs was to transport them to remote localities and detonate them. But nobody could predict whether the bomb would explode during transportation.

Wu's unit transported the bomb to nearby open ground. More than 400 police personnel from the public security bureau were on guard everyday, to prevent anybody from approaching the bomb.

That was when Wu thought of Ji and his invention. Ji had obtained a national patent in 2009 for his invention, and had modified it further.

Before leaving for his mission, Ji researched online about the bomb. But all he got was bad news. For instance, a World War II bomb found at a construction site in Gottingen, Germany, on June 1, 2010. After the evacuation of 7,000 people, the bomb exploded unexpectedly and killed three experienced sappers, who had defused up to 700 bombs in more than 20 years. Six people were injured.

Like Germany, China, one of the major battlegrounds of World War II, has many unexploded bombs, though the total number is unknown.

Even though Ji was depressed with what he read online, he threw caution to the wind. Together with his partner Song Xingwei, they transported the water jet cutting machine to the site to disarm the bomb on June 11. There was a fire truck and an ambulance, on standby.

""If the bomb exploded, the vehicles would be blown into the sky with me,"" Ji recalls with a laugh.

No tragedy happened. Ji successfully sliced the bomb apart.

The bomb defusing machine was not Ji's first and only invention.

Since the 1990s, Ji has successfully invented gasoline saving and anti-theft equipment, which won him national patent certifications, amounting to 2 million yuan ($317,000).

Ji says he has a knack for engineering and machinery. About 20 years ago, Ji and Song worked together at an auto repair garage.

""I could tell what's wrong with a car by listening to the sound of its engine,"" says Ji, who picked up his love for inventing during those early years.

In 2002, Ji's friend, Zhao Chengning, from the army, suggested that Ji invent equipment to destroy waste ammunition.

""The usual way to collect the ammunition and detonate it in the open air was unsafe and caused air pollution,"" Zhao says.

Ji invented an automatic ammunition disposal furnace, the first of its kind in China. It is now used widely by the army and police to treat waste ammunition.

But, the furnace was unable to dispose of the huge bomb, prompting Ji to research techniques for disposing of bombs.

""Most ammunition technicians in Western countries use advanced tools like X-ray, high-performance sensors, remote control disposal vehicles and even robots, but those are too expensive,"" Ji says.

Thus, he switched his focus to a water jet cutting machine, which is commonly used to slice metals and other materials in various industries.

Water jet cutters are commonly connected to a high-pressure water pump where water is then ejected from the nozzle, cutting through the material by spraying it with a high-speed water jet, mixed with other abrasives, such as garnet.

""The problem with commercial water jet cutters is the strong pressure, which could impact bombs. So, the key was to lower the pressure, and it was not easy,"" Ji says.

""Industrial cutters have a water speed of over 320 km/h, but we need to control it to under 80 km/h,"" Ji adds.

Ji picked up computer programming to create the remote control of the cutter. ""He bought books and locked himself in a room, eating instant noodles for weeks,"" Song recalls.

According to Ji, there is a huge market for such machines. In 2008, the Olympic Games imported an anti-bomb water jet cutting machine from a German company, which cost $200,000.

Since 2010, Ji has been selling his water jet cutter to public security bureaus, fire stations, as well as oil and gas companies all over China. In 2011, his cutter was bought for the World University Games in Shenzhen.

Looking to escape to the beach this summer? Well, before you book that trip to Cape Cod or the Outer Banks of North Carolina, you might want to consider an unorthodox option — the shores of Lake Superior. The lake, which is the northernmost, coldest, and deepest of the five Great Lakes, is the warmest it has been at this time of year in at least a century, thanks to the mild winter, warm spring, and hot, dry summer.

A comparison between Lake Superior's average water temperature this year so far and the longer-term average. Click on the image for a larger version. Credit: GLERL.

OK, so the lake’s average water temperature is still a bracing 68 degrees, but it's considered downright tropical for the region. As the above chart shows, based on the 30-year average, the lake’s average water temperature should be in the mid-50s. But thanks to scant lake ice cover this past winter, along with a rare March heat wave and warmer-than-average weather since then, the lake began warming earlier than normal, and that warming has kept right on going. Wintertime ice cover on the Great Lakes was the lowest observed since such records began in 1980.

“It’s pretty safe to say that what we’re seeing here is the warmest that we’ve seen in Lake Superior in a century,” said Jay Austin, a professor at the University of Minnesota at Duluth, who has researched the lake’s water temperatures back to the beginning of the 20th century.

The lake's record temperatures are yet another consequence of the record heat so far in 2012. The contiguous U.S. had its warmest January-to-June period since records began in the late 19th century. Manmade global warming will likely result in more years with very warm water temperatures, which could have significant adverse consequences for marine life. In a rare benefit from the ongoing drought, this summer has been so dry that the warm water temperatures are not resulting in major harmful algal blooms, such as one that occurred on Lake Erie last year.

Instrument data from three buoys in Lake Superior provide a reliable record of water temperatures since about 1980, and the information also shows that, with water temperatures running in the mid-to-upper 60s (and even warmer closer to shore), “we are at record temperatures for this time of year,” according to Austin.

Austin said that water temperatures at the westernmost edge of Lake Superior are running in the mid-70s, and it was due in part to the runoff from flooding rains that struck Duluth, Minn., in late June.

Because of sand and other particles within in the runoff, sunlight is not penetrating far below the surface, and that helps heat near-surface waters more significantly than if clearer waters were present, Austin said.

Data shows a long-term warming trend throughout the Great Lakes, which may be related to manmade climate change. According to George Leskevich, a physical research scientist with the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich., there is also a long-term downward trend in Great Lakes wintertime ice cover, although there is considerable year-to-year variability.

The all-time daily average high temperature record for Lake Superior is 71°F, which was recorded in mid-August 2010. With a few more weeks of warming left, that record is in jeopardy.

“The season hasn’t played itself out yet and we’re already within 3 degrees of the all-time daily record surface temperature,” Austin said.

Leshkevich said that low wintertime ice cover, combined with the record warmth during March, helped jump-start the warm season, particularly in the western Great Lakes. The eastern Great Lakes, such as Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, have also been running at or above temperatures seen during the past six years, but they are not at such unprecedented levels, according to GLERL data. Lake Erie is the shallowest of the Great Lakes, and therefore it is typically the first to warm up during the spring.

Lake Superior had much below average ice cover during the 2011-12 winter, as this chart shows. Click on the image for a larger version. Credit: GLERL.

“You probably got a running start to the heating season and it’s been so warm here, certainly in the Midwest and Great Lakes area, I think it’s just kept going,” Leshkevich said.

For example, the South Buoy on Lake Michigan, located 43 nautical miles southeast of Milwaukee, recorded a water temperature of 80°F on Friday July 6, a feat the National Weather Service (NWS) said was “remarkable . . . for the lake to begin with . . . But unprecedented for this early in the summer season.” The previous date of the earliest 80°F temperature was July 21, which was set during both 2010 and 2011.

The average water temperature for July 6 at the South Buoy is a chilly 63°F.

The rapid temperature increase on Lake Michigan was closely tied to the heat waves that have affected the Midwest this summer. Chicago has experienced its warmest year to date, and the early July heat wave in the Windy City that sent temperatures soaring into the triple digits caused water temperatures at the South Buoy to climb by 10°F during the course of just one week, the NWS said.

Ironically, if the lakes enter the fall with record warm temperatures, it could herald an above-average season for lake effect snow, which occurs when cold, dry air blows across large expanses of comparatively milder waters.","Wed, 25 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.climatecentral.org/assets/images/og-images/2019OGimage.jpg,"['temperatures', 'lakes', 'warm', 'average', 'temperature', 'water', 'record', 'lake', 'great', 'levels', 'superior']",

By OLA AJAYI, Ibadan

BUT for the timely intervention of Oyo State governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, who opened up about 199 drainage channels linked to streams and rivers within Ibadan metropolis, the state would, by now, be counting another heavy human and material loss after the heavy downpour that sacked many residents in the city from their homes.

When the rain that started on Saturday evening and continued for three to four hours, many residents in the city, especially those living in houses that are close to riverbanks, needed no soothsayer to warn them of impending danger. And with the ugly incident of August 26, 2012 still fresh in their memories, some of them abandoned their property and fled for dear lives.

The rains fell heavily throughout the night and continued on Sunday morning so that some Christians could not take the risk of going to their churches.

While commenting on the effects of the flood, the State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr. Bosun Oladele, said the incident had further exposed some of the structures that should be demolished on the water ways, especially at Orita Challenge and other parts of the city.

Oladele said: “Some of the structures that were not marked for demolition before were being exposed and the government would have no choice than to continue with the demolition exercise. But, on the whole, we thank God that no casualty has been recorded”.

The government had many times threatened that it would demolish structures obstructing waterways but rescinded its decision due to some pending litigations filed by the owners of the structures. It had earlier marked over 200 houses but ended up demolishing about 56 houses. This generated heated arguments with some landlords alleging that the government had introduced some political considerations to the demolition exercise.

Dr. Festus Adedayo, the Special Adviser on media also explained why the government was hesitant in demolishing the affected structures. He said: “The government has been very careful, lest the people rise up against it just like they did when 3, 000 workers with falsified ages and forged certificates were sacked.

If the red-marked 200 houses have been demolished at a time, you know what would have happened. Our advice is that people residing in such buildings should vacate them. The government had relocated some victims of last year’s flood. It cannot assist all. So, let the people assist the government to avert any further loss”.

One of the victims of the recent flood, Mr. Sakiru Adarabiabo who fled when his house was submerged said: “We have been in this house for many years. And until last year, we never had any problem of flooding. We are always scared any time it appears as if it’s about to rain. How long shall we live in fear. We have no money to build another house. Where shall we move to?”

Another victim, Mr. Akinjide Akintola, the Political Editor of Nigerian Compass, complained: “The bridge needs attention. It is too low and the river really needs proper dredging. In the first place, political influence affected the construction of the bridge. Instead of making the road from Orita to run straight and make the flow of water to be much easier, it was bent over there, so that some houses belonging to some powerful ones on the other side would not be affected”.

One of the residents of Apete, Mr. Najeem Raheem, said: “It was as a result of this situation that many residents of this community stayed at home yesterday. The pedestrian bridge we are managing has collapsed. There is no way we can move out through it. The other road linking Ajibode is so bad that it is not passable.

The one to Akufo is also bad with many potholes created by rain since it was graded. The Polytechnic students and staff are now in dilemma. Students of Lifeforte School here are starting exams tomorrow (today), and so many of them will have to miss it except the exam is postponed.

People here are particularly not happy with the way the contractor, KBB International, is handling the bridge. Transportation from Apete to Sango which used to attract a fare of N50 now goes for N500. This is becoming unbearable”.

Meanwhile, dissatisfied with the level of work done so far many months after commencement, the state government has revoked the contract it signed with the company. The state Commissioner for Works and Transport, Alhaji Yunus Akintunde, who spoke with newsmen after the weekly state executive meeting said with the intensity of the rain, government had to act fast.

He said: “The council equally considered the Apete Bridge today and resolved that because of the current development and the heavy downpour that had suddenly occurred, there is the need to take a drastic action on the bridge construction so as to ameliorate the suffering of our people. In this wise, council decided that the drastic measure would have to be a reassessment and re-awarding of the bridge contract which should take place within the next 24 hours”.

His counterpart, the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development noted that: “The government is beginning soon the second phase of the removal of such structures (built on flood plains). However, we are inhibited by the activities of some landlords and landlords’ associations whose houses are located on flood plains who have taken government to court even for marking their structures for demolition. But we do plan to embark on the demolition exercise very soon. We have marked the structures and we are going to remove them but we may not cover them in totality due to these court injunctions”.

Owing to the enormity of the project, Dr. Adedayo, said that part of the pro-active measures the government took was to work in partnership with the World Bank. “Because the task of reconstructing these bridges is so massive and is beyond the state government alone, immediately after last year’s flood, Governor Abiola Ajimobi met with officials of the World Bank and did a power-point presentation on the case of Ibadan flood disaster, upon which the bank sent its representatives to the state for an assessment. The report has culminated in the bank, with the support of the Federal Ministry of Finance, agreeing in principle to grant the state government the sum of N200 million emergency relief, which is almost ready.

“Part of the fund is to channelise the 30 kilometres Ona River and complete the Upper Ogunpa River, along with helping solve the state waste management challenges, from storage, collection, transportation to disposal sites, so as to turn them into sanitary landfills and to eventually begin a waste-to-wealth programme. An absence of these efforts has often been a major cause of flood disasters,” the government said.

The green credentials of mud houses may not traditionally impressed villagers in Sindh for whom building with bricks, mortar and girder have grown to symbolise a step up in life. The floods of 2010 and 2011 changed all that. But now, as they rebuild with disaster-resistant technology, they are realising that they can return to nature in order to withstand Mother Nature.





According to the provincial disaster management authority, 698,451 houses, mostly katcha or mud houses, were destroyed in last year’s flooding.Given the magnitude of the disaster, the government and private groups could only do so much to get them back up on their feet, leaving a majority of the homeless to fend for themselves. The dwellings built for these people mainly featured concrete structures which are too expensive for the poor and alien to the rural set-up.Villagers have historically been living in houses made of sand, mud, straw, bamboo, sun-dried brick, grass, reed, thatch, cow dung. These structures are classified as Chapper, Kothi, Waung and Chaunro houses in Sindh. But they are prone to risks posed by rains, floods, storms and earthquakes.Poverty is not the only reason why families have built mud houses. “The peasants always live in fear of being evicted from their dwellings as the land where they live on is owned by their landlord,” explains Taj Mari, a peasant rights activist. Therefore, spending their hard-earned money to build a concrete structure is never an option for them, he believes.As the menace of recurrent floods and torrential rains looms large, rebuilding is a dilemma for peasants as they know that these mud houses are not disaster resistant.But now, architect and the chairperson of Heritage Foundation of Pakistan Yasmeen Lari is offering a solution that uses pretty much the same material they’ve used for centuries with a small difference – they’re building smarter.Her katcha house model chiefly uses locally available material to build rain- and flood-resistant units. “We do not need concrete and steel in the rural areas. The people here have their own crafts [in making houses with local material] which should be efficiently used to build hazard-resistant houses,” she told The Express Tribune this week. She discourages the use of material like cement, steel and burnt bricks whose production contributes to global warming.The HF has supported the construction of about 180 houses in Mohak Sharif and neighbouring villages in Tando Allahyar district. These units also offer protection for rations, water, livestock and fodder. They come with improvised sanitation methods, called aquatic toilets.Lari’s model uses material that makes the foundation, walls and roof stronger. “Actually the problem is not with the mud walls [in katcha houses],” she says, “but with the roofs made of steel girders, which damage the supporting walls.”Lari uses sand, mud, straw, wheat stalk, reed, bamboo, lime, cow dung and nuts and bolts. Except for the lime, bamboo, nuts and bolts, all the other materials are locally available.According to Naeem Khan, a field coordinator with the HF in Mohak Sharif, they use a mixture of lime, sand and crush to make the base strong. The walls, made of straw mats, are plastered with a mixture of sand, mud, lime, straw and cow dung and the bamboos are used as pillars. The primary feature in the roof is a bamboo purlin. This ‘Karavan roof’ is made of plastic sheets, straw mats, mixture of lime and sand that make it impervious, weatherized and sturdy enough to bear heavy weight. “The construction of a room costs around Rs30,000 with the labour and most of the material available for free,” Khan says.After reconstruction, the village experienced the recent pre-monsoon rains. Resident Muhammad Umar Wassan was able to see the roofs in action much to his delight. But fear remains. “I hope that my house will not collapse if the floods strike again,” he says. His family has been living in the village for over five decades.The UN’s International Organisation for Migration has also adopted Lari’s model. According to IOM’s Manuel Marques Pereira, it is funding construction for more than 20,000 units in Mirpurkhas, Tharparkar, Umerkot and Tando Allahyar. Lari now wants to see NGOs, the corporate sector, landlords, civil society and even student volunteers help out.Published in The Express Tribune, July 29, 2012.","Sat, 28 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",http://i1.tribune.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/414411-ChaurasPHOTOMARIYAMNIZAM-1343498690.jpg,"['lime', 'straw', 'return', 'floods', 'nature', 'shore', 'vagaries', 'mud', 'bamboo', 'walls', 'mother', 'earths', 'sand', 'villages', 'uses', 'material', 'houses', 'wares']",

Nature's Edge Notebook #33

Observation, Analysis, Reflection, New Questions

Who's most to blame for global warming?

Nobody meant it to happen.

But it has, and there's no debate among the world's scientists about which country is ""most responsible."" That is, about which nation has injected the greatest amount of the heat-trapping invisible gas CO2 into to the atmosphere, where a lot of it remains for years, piling up and only adding to the heat.

The answer: United States has, with China a distant second.

And figured on a per person basis, the ""most responsible"" is the United Kingdom, with the United States a close second, Germany a close third, and China a distant seventh.

If you're surprised the ""most to blame"" isn't China, the explanation is simple:

In about 2007, China did pass the United States in putting the greatest amount of CO2 into the air per year , but China's economic boom only got started recently and they still have a couple of decades to go (if there are no drastic changes) before they catch up with the United States in the total cumulative amount of heat-trapping CO2 they will have been piling up in the air.

(Regarding the per person way of thinking, the United Kingdom's population is about 62 million, America's is just over 310 million, Germany's about 82 million, and China's about 1.4 billion.)

The graphs below from NASA show all this responsibility in simple form. Most 12-year-olds understand them in a matter of minutes.

(And as reported in our previous Nature's Edge Notebook and as is now taught in many middle schools around the world - there is no debate among the world's climate scientists that human emissions are causing the increasing global heat, nor that these emissions are the direct overall cause of the rapidly increasing frequency of heatwaves, drought and flood … and thus of the crippled agriculture and suffering those things are already bringing more frequently in various parts of the world - this year, notably, in the United States.)

Actually, this is old news.

The world's climate scientists have been in clear agreement about it for years.

Nobody Meant This to Happen, But Now That We Understand…

Global warming was not expected to be a result of the industrial revolution and of the current fossil fuel based, electricity dependent civilization it led to.

(The great majority of the world's electricity is generated by burning coal, which pours heat-trapping CO2 into the air.)

But now we know it is the result.

So the question of who - which nations or people - are ""most responsible"" is an inevitable and important part of negotiations about how to deal with it.

Obviously, it has inescapable moral implications, including in the fact that many who suffer most from it - in poorer countries - are often those who put by far the least CO2 into the air.

It may of course help, when looking at these graphs showing ""who's most responsible,"" to remember that nobody meant this to happen.

But it has long been impossible for any nation - or any multi-national corporation - to go on emitting greenhouse gases without being aware of the general consequences.

(This reporter has not yet found any credible comparisons that may exist assessing which multinational corporations may be ""most to blame"" or most responsible for cumulative and lingering emissions, though if such comparison are indeed even possible, they might help indicate some aspects of how negotiators might seek to apportion responsibility.)

Four Simple Facts (And graphs) Showing Who's Most Responsible

Simple fact #1:

A significant portion of the heat-trapping CO2 humans put into the air stays there for years - some for 100 years, and even much longer.

Note that, after falling out of the atmosphere quickly during the first 50 years to about a third, the ""decay"" of the CO2 emissions slows dramatically.

Twenty-seven percent of it is still up there after 100 years, 17 percent after 500 years, and 14 percent after 1000 years.

This ""decay,"" say the scientists, is due to the fact that, over time, some of the excess CO2 in the air is taken up by plants and absorbed into the soil, and some absorbed into seawater (which causes a second great problem, the growing acidification of the oceans.)

Scientists, including those at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, have determined that - as its widely respected longtime Director James Hansen tells ABC News - ""climate change is proportional to the cumulative emissions.""

In other words, the build-up of global warming over the past couple of centuries has increased at rates directly proportional to the total amount of emissions that humans have been putting into the air… even though some of those emissions are eventually absorbed back out of the air.

Simple fact #2:

The nation that has put biggest cumulative portion of CO2 into the air, thus helping heat the planet, is the USA.

Note that China, India, Russia, Japan, Germany, and the UK are each a small fraction of the US … in total cumulative emissions.

Simple - and surprising - fact #3:

On a per capita basis, the biggest portion of cumulative CO2 heating the planet was emitted not by the United States, but by the United Kingdom.

That's partly because the United Kingdom created the ""industrial revolution"" around the year 1800, first by burning enormous amounts of coal.

The UK led that revolution for so long that, on a per person basis, it is still the ""most responsible"" for the world's excess heat now and in the near future, with Americans a close second and Germans a close third.

Note that per person, the United States is a close second and Germany, whose industrial activity (as shown in this next graph) started before that in the United States, a close third, and they are followed by the more distant Canada, Russia and Japan. China is a distant seventh.

Simple fact #4 (to clarify any confusion about China's role):

China's economic boom only got going recently, and only started producing more CO2 emissions per year than the United States in about 2007.

That's why its cumulative contribution to the heat-trapping greenhouse gases is still a distant second to that of the United States. At current rates, China won't catch up to the United States for a couple of decades.

In the single year of 2010, China's total emissions (23.9 percent of the world's emissions) exceeded America's (which were 17.2 percent).

-------

One more simple fact - one that bears deeply on all negotiations about how to deal with this global crisis.

There are no borders in the world's constantly swirling atmosphere, nor in the ocean's many globe-girdling ""conveyor belt"" currents.

Any heat-trapping and ocean-acidifying CO2 gets pretty well mixed in everywhere soon after it is emitted, whatever and wherever the source.

The damage so far - and for the next couple of decades (during which the heat is expected to keep rising, regardless of what nations agree to do) - will have been done more by the United States than by any other nation.

But this is not, in the impression of this reporter, the main reason the countries of the world have been hoping Washington will take the lead in dealing with it.

Government leaders in Europe, China, India, Russia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America have for many years expressed hope that the United States would become the global leader in forging binding agreements to drastically cut the heat-trapping CO2 emissions worldwide.

They apparently have done so mainly because they feel that the single greatest superpower would be able to set the tone, not only because the United States is ""most to blame"" in the sense of having put the single largest amount of CO2 up there.

But the fact of America having emitted the most is still a major factor in the diplomatic requests for the US to take the lead.

Especially in the absence of global leadership from the United States on this matter, this hard and undisputed fact of which nation is ""most to blame"" seems to many observers likely to be increasingly an issue in negotiations as the effects of manmade global warming grow worse.

70,70,FL-2012-000121-CHN,"India's farmers wait for more monsoon rains as crops struggle, food prices rise - Washington Post",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/as-crops-wither-and-food-prices-rise-indias-farmers-wait-for-a-good-long-rain/2012/07/28/gJQAa9YGGX_story.html,"Kancharu Pawar, a 51-year-old farmer, gazed despondently at his soybean crop. The plants are only just poking out of the soil, even though it is halfway through the four-month rainy season.

“It should be two feet high by now, but it’s not even coming off the ground,” he said. “There is no growth in the plants. There is no rain.”

India’s monsoon rains, which run from June to September, so far are a fifth below average levels. Western India has been worst hit, with rains as much as 70 percent below average in some areas.

Farmers in and around Lasalgaon, a rural town in western India, are seeing brief drizzles each day instead of the usual hours of downpours. In Mumbai, the financial capital on the western coast, roads that usually flood this time of year, forcing the cancellation of business meetings, are open.

India’s government had predicted a normal rainy season, but this week it forecast that the overall monsoon would produce 92 percent of average rainfall, edging closer to the 90 percent mark that signals the first level of drought. More than half of India’s farmlands are not irrigated and rely wholly on rain. Skymet, a private weather forecaster, says there is a 60 percent chance of a drought.

A failed monsoon for one of the world’s biggest producers of grains and sugar could add to pressure on global food prices, with corn and soybean futures hitting record highs this month as the United States experiences its worst drought in 50 years. India’s poor rains likewise threaten yields of soybeans, corn, sugar cane and rice, monsoon-

dependent crops with long germination periods. India’s Agriculture Ministry recently said that rice planting was down by a 10th compared with this time last year, as farmers await rain.

India’s government says it has enough grain stored to feed its people if necessary, although distribution networks are weak.

Yet the main concern is that a poor monsoon — India relies on the monsoon for three-quarters of its annual rainfall — would exacerbate the country’s economic slowdown.

India’s economy grew by 5.3 percent between January and March, the slowest quarterly rate for seven years. Economists say such a rate, if sustained, cannot support the rapidly growing population of India, which is home to 1.2 billion people and is set to overtake China as the world’s most populous country by 2025.

“We are already fighting an economic slowdown, so the chance of a drought adds to the worry,” said Anubhuti Sahay, a senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank in India.

Homegrown and foreign companies alike have been hoping that rural consumers will offset falling sales in the cities this year. India’s farmers have been largely sheltered from the slowdown because of good monsoons and high government subsidies in recent years, as well as their low reliance on bank credit. Consumer goods companies have thus been racing to design low-wattage fans and humidity-resistant televisions for countryside customers.

“Over the last year, we have been doing a lot of research into these smaller towns to find out what these consumers want,” said Mahesh Krishnan, who heads the home appliances division at Samsung India.

But a poor monsoon could dash corporate India’s contingency plan. Weak rains can cut farmers’ spending for a whole year, denting sales of everything from shampoo to gold jewelry. Pawar, the farmer in Lasalgaon, who lives on a 10-acre site inherited from his father, said that he has enough savings for this year should most of his crops fail but that he and his family of five would have to live far more frugally.

India’s fractious coalition government, weighed down by infighting, corruption scandals and a slowing economy, also has much to lose. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will have to bail out farmers should rains remain elusive. Agriculture contributes 17 percent to India’s gross domestic product but employs 60 percent of its population, making farmers a vital voting bloc. Any increase in food prices, which are already high because of a weak rupee, will further alienate rural and urban voters.

This week, Singh’s office announced a package of handouts that could be deployed if the monsoon continues to disappoint. The proposals include higher subsidies for pulses such as lentils and chickpeas, staples of the Indian diet, and an expansion of rural job-creation schemes.

The coming week will tell whether India experiences a drought this year, said Jatin Singh, Skymet’s founder.

“If July finishes still down by a fifth, then drought is imminent,” he said. “You would need a third more rains in August, which is unlikely.”

For now, Lasalgaon’s farmers watch the skies as anxiously as Mumbai’s traders watch the descending rupee.

Ajit Bhosale, who runs a fertilizer shop in Lasalgaon, said his sales are down by half compared to last July.

“Usually by this time it has already rained enough for us to know that our troubles are over,” he said, looking around the empty shop and at the light drizzle outside.","Sat, 28 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2012/07/27/Interactivity/Images/India_Monsoon_Prayers_0f482.jpg?t=20170517,"['monsoon', 'week', 'indias', 'wait', 'farmers', 'rise', 'prices', 'struggle', 'rains', 'food', 'rural', 'drought', 'sales', 'india', 'crops', 'western']",

The couple ended their marriage last year following allegations that Ashton had been cheating on her with a number of women but after pictures surfaced of the 'Two And A Half Men' actor kissing new love Mila Kunis, Demi, 49,reportedly became hysterical.

A source told RadarOnline: ""Demi is devastated that Ashton has moved on so quickly and is dating Mila. She is beyond heartbroken.

""Even though Ashton cheated on her all the time, it was with random girls, it wasn't a relationship like it is with Mila and that is what is killing Demi now.

""Seeing photos of him kissing another woman is too much for her to handle, it's like having her nose rubbed in it time and time again. She kind of knew it was definitely over between them but I think she was still holding out a little hope for a reconciliation -- now he's actually dating someone else she knows that's not going to happen.""

Ashton, 34, and 28-year-old Mila have been friends since working on 'That 70s Show' together and their relationship is said to be ""like a knife"" in Demi's heart.

The source added: ""Each time Demi hears about Ashton and Mila it breaks her heart.

The 'Rocky' actor was among the many people who came to pay their respects to 36-year-old Sage during the service at St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church in Los Angeles.

Following the service, Sage's body was then driven to Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, where he was laid to rest.

Sage - Sylvester's 36-year-old son from his first marriage to Sasha Czack - was found unresponsive on July 13 at his Studio City apartment in Los Angeles.

An initial autopsy on Sage's body proved inconclusive and the cause of his death is not expected to be known for up to two months until the toxicology tests are completed.

Following Sage's tragic passing, Sylvester, 66, spoke out about his terrible loss.

He said: ""When a parent loses a child there is no greater pain. Therefore I am imploring people to respect my talented son's memory and feel compassion for his loving mother Sasha.""

He also ""begged"" for the memory and soul of Sage - who played the actor's onscreen son in 1990 movie 'Rocky V' - to be ""left in peace"" amid speculation of how he died.

He added: ""This agonising loss will be felt for the rest of our lives.

The 33-year-old actress-and-designer has reportedly seen her Holmes & Yang sales soar after she announced the end of her five-year marriage to the 'Mission: Impossible' actor last month.

Since then Katie's range - which was previously stocked in Harvey Nichols in the UK before the shop opted against buying it for the autumn/winter 2012-13 season - has seen a sales increase in stores such as Barney's and Bergdorf Goodman, according to sales assistants.

A former Bergdorf Goodman executive told The New York Times: ""The way she's getting photographed today, she's in a position to get more exposure than ever before.

""She's not waiting for fashion editors and stylists to come and pull her clothes.""

Following the announcement of the couple's divorce, Katie - who has been granted primary custody of her and Tom's six-year-old daughter, Suri - has been photographed a number of times in her own designs, and fashion designer David Zyla believes the couple's split was a ""dream publicity opportunity"" for her range.

He told Fox News: ""Katie's divorce and the masterful manner in which she handled it, is shining a light onto anything that she does at this moment.

""This is a dream publicity opportunity for the label. The buyers will actually place their orders after the September show for delivery in February, so we will [have a better idea of its success] in the autumn/winter 2012-13 season.

""Provided that the collection is on-trend as well as purchased and merchandised well by the store buyers, I predict a tremendous amount of interest in the collection at the retail level when it hits stores next February.

The 22-year-old actress - who made a public apology to her boyfriend Robert Pattinson yesterday (25.07.12) for cheating on him with the director - is seeking forgiveness from British model Liberty Ross and decided to do so in private as she ""didn't feel it was appropriate"" to include her in her statement.

A source said: ""Kristen didn't feel it was appropriate to issue a public apology to Liberty once the story of her affair with Rupert broke.

""Instead, she's going to do the decent thing and write Liberty a private letter expressing her deepest regret for her actions.

""She was thinking of including Liberty, Rupert and the kids in her public apology - but Kristen was so desperate to save her relationship with Rob she decided to concentrate on that first.""

Kristen feels ""awful"" about her illicit affair, particularly because Rupert and Liberty have two young children, Skyla and Tennyson.

The source added to RadarOnline.com: ""Kristen feels she made a terribly naive mistake and will do anything to make amends. The fact that Liberty and Rupert have two kids has now dawned on her and she feels awful for what she did.""

Kristen described the relationship as a ""momentary indiscretion"" in her apology yesterday.

She said: ""I'm deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I've caused to those close to me and everyone this has affected. This momentary indiscretion has jeopardised the most important thing in my life, the person I love and respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love him, I'm so sorry.""

Rupert also issued an apology, saying he was ""utterly distraught"" about his actions.

76,76,FL-2012-000121-CHN,How I hacked my brain with Adderall: a cautionary tale - The Verge,https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/26/3184496/hacked-brain-adderall-cautionary-tale,"The super-jolt of energy novice users experience mellows after a few days of use and changes character dramatically. It does become a very sufficient coffee replacement: a little ritual combined with chemical stimulation that motivates you to get out of bed. But coming up daily on Adderall has less to do with a caffeinated sensation than it does with becoming a detail-oriented post-human, a machine following self-imposed routines with little regard for anything outside the routine’s scope. It turns out that my Adderall self has a knack for accounting, spreadsheets, and administrative tasks that my unstimulated self would normally shy away from: an inbox-zeroing robot bent on eking out every last ounce of productivity my heightened senses could spit out. Keeping up with the moving parts of being self-employed, as I am, is easy on Adderall. It feels almost robotic, as if I'm hiring an assistant to take care of the books. But an Adderall prescription is much cheaper than hiring a competent assistant, and I always know I can trust myself (even if it is a different version of myself) to keep it honest when it comes to my bottom line.

There is an issue of time here as well. As someone in the content generation industry, my normal self's most valuable asset is creativity: producing product that others will pay, in one way or another, to consume. Transforming into an Administrative Jekyll for a certain amount of time every day limits the amount of time my Creative Hyde can come up with content to market and sell. Luckily, amphetamines have that problem tackled as well: when you're using them, you don't have to sleep... at all. That frees up quite a few hours of the day. Amphetamine’s extreme appetite suppressant qualities will also save time you used to spend going to the grocery store. As someone with a penchant for eating everything that's in my field of vision (often to help me avoid doing work), this was all fine with me: I waved goodbye to expensive lunches (well, to lunch in general, actually) and to those peanut butter and Cheetos-induced pounds that normally hang out around my waistline.

“How’s it hangin, Death?”

–Evil Ted, 1991

One of the first things you notice about Adderall is its ""hard reset"" effect on your metabolism. As you begin to come up, you'd best plan to be near a toilet. Part of the impetus for this whole shitshow was my recently-acquired and very violent intolerance of coffee. While Adderall doesn't induce the internal bleeding coffee had begun to elicit in my bowels, it's obviously a very powerful stimulant, without a lot of the rot-gut acidic effects coffee has in its arsenal. Side effect number one, noted, with cautious optimism.

Around came the second, after about two weeks of regular use: rampant eye twitches. Not anything that would interfere with my daily habits, but still an annoyance I knew was coming from the medication. A constant reminder to me and my confidants that something unnatural was acting out in my body. Fluttering eyelids were one thing I was willing to deal with — I was ESPN-bound, after all! But the first time I became truly scared of what was happening to me was when the discharge began.

77,77,FL-2012-000121-CHN,Scientists find Grand Canyon-sized rift under Antarctic ice - SKNVibes.com,http://www.sknvibes.com/news/newsdetails.cfm/61077,"(Paris, FRA) - Scientists have discovered a rift the size of the Grand Canyon hidden under the Antarctic ice sheet, which they say is contributing to ice melt and a consequent rise in the sea level.

The rift, some 1.5 kilometres (one mile) deep, 10 kilometres wide and 100 kilometres long, was found by researchers using radar to measure the subglacial topography, glaciologist Robert Bingham told AFP.

""If you imagine the Grand Canyon but filled with ice and then even that whole feature is then also uniformly beneath another kilometre of ice,"" is how he described the feature whose magnitude he said was a ""surprise"" to the team.

Scientist believe a shrinking West Antarctic Ice Sheet is responsible for about 10 percent of climate-change-induced sea level rise, which if unchecked threatens to flood many coastal cities within a few generations.

The sheet, a huge mass of ice up to four kilometres thick that covers the land surface and stretches into the sea, is melting faster than any other part of Antarctica.

But scientists' sketchy knowledge of the sub-surface topography has made it difficult to predict the exact rate and extent of ice sheet loss, said the study published in Nature.

The newly discovered valley, formed long before the region was covered by ice, is believed to be part of a wider West Antarctic rift system, ""which we've known exists but we don't know where it goes,"" said Bingham.

""We are now getting a better idea that parts of this rift system actually go ... further west than we previously knew about.""

The type of rift found under the Ferrigno Ice Stream is caused when a continental plate starts to tear apart -- like the large lakes that fill rift systems in parts of East Africa today.

""It is the shape of the rift that contributes to the fact that the region is vulnerable to ice melt,"" Bingham explained of the Antarctic discovery.

""Because the rift is there it means that the ice is both deeper and slopes inland as you move away from the sea and both of those conditions make this a vulnerable topography to ice thinning effects"" by allowing warm sea water to flow inland along a trough created by the rift to attack the ice on the coastline.

Bingham said the find showed that not only modern climate factors but also geology is contributing to ice loss.

""I think where it changes our view just ever so slightly is that this issue is traditionally conceptualised as a modern effect of global warming, and what we see is that that modern effect is actually superimposed on a very ancient geological evolution.

""It helps us to appreciate that the whole process is something that occurs over many cycles of time.""

Scientists had only visited the region once before, over 50 years ago, in 1961.

This time, experts from the University of Aberdeen and the British Antarctic Survey conducted three months of fieldwork in 2010.

""We targeted the area because we knew from satellite measurements that there was ice thinning taking place,"" said Bingham.

""When we did the survey and we found this rift, that actually was a surprise that it was much, much deeper and preconditioned to this thinning than we expected.""

The only way to find such a valley covered by an ice sheet is by using radar on the spot, he added.","Thu, 26 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.sknvibes.com/Classifieds/images/noimageavail.jpg,"['thinning', 'canyonsized', 'kilometres', 'sheet', 'scientists', 'region', 'grand', 'sea', 'topography', 'west', 'antarctic', 'rift', 'ice']",

After a week of sunshine, rain and the forecast of hail on the second day of competition affected the start of tennis on the lawn courts at Wimbledon and made for slippery conditions in the women's cycling road race.

It didn't seem to bother the swimmers. Lochte had the second-fastest time in qualifying for the 200-meter freestyle, the morning after his stunning win in a 400-meter individual medley final that will be famous for the fact Michael Phelps missed a medal.

""I didn't get to bed until like 2 a.m. so I'm a little tired, but it was a prelims swim, so I'm not too worried about it,"" said Lochte, who went out with family and friends to celebrate his victory. Phelps won an unprecedented 8 golds at the Beijing Olympics, but now can't win any more than six in London.

China's Sun is on track for a second gold medal after leading qualifiers in the 200 freestyle in 1 minute, 46.24 seconds the morning after his victory in the 400 freestyle.

While the weather was bad, there were other blights: a female gymnast from Uzbekistan was provisionally suspended after failing a doping test, the second case of the games. The IOC says Luiza Galiulina tested positive for the diuretic furosemide on Wednesday. It came a day after the IOC expelled Albanian weightlifter Hysen Pulaku from the games after he tested positive for the banned steroid stanozolol on July 23.

And hundreds of fans wanting to see New Zealand, Brazil, Belarus and Egypt were stranded in London or forced to sit on the train floor Sunday as service operators supplied only two morning London-to-Manchester services in time for the noon kickoff of the New Zealand-Egypt match in Manchester, 200 miles (320 kilometers) northwest of London.

Many fans said they were refused entry to the trains at stops north of London, while others successfully begged their way aboard and sat on the floor.

At Wimbledon in southwest London, the new retractable roof came in handy. Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, Venus Williams and Maria Sharapova were scheduled to play matches.

In the first of 14 gold medals to be presented Sunday, shooter Guo Wenjun defended her women's 10-meter air pistol title, giving China its second gold at the range and a leading fifth of the games.

Elsewhere, the 3-meter synchronized springboard was set to kick off the 10-event diving program which the Chinese are expected to dominate — at Beijing four years ago, the hosts won nine of the 10 diving golds.

Gold medals were also scheduled in weightlifting, archery and fencing, along with four finals in swimming on Sunday night.

The French basketball team has one of the toughest assignments of the day against the mighty U.S. team. France will be led by San Antonio guard Tony Parker and other NBA players Ronny Turiaf, Boris Diaw, Nicolas Batum, Kevin Seraphin and Nando de Colo.

Their problem is that the Americans have two of the NBA's biggest superstars — LeBron James and Kobe Bryant.

""We know how the Americans play and we know our priorities: slow down their quick game and control the boards,"" Vincent Collet said. ""We are the kid facing the monster. And when you are a monster, you impose your game on your rivals.""

At the Olympic equestrian complex, Zara Phillips, granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II, had a few royal fans in the stands as she made her equestrian debut.

Phillips' grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, as well as her mother, Princess Anne, were in the VIP seats at Greenwich Park as Phillips rode her horse, High Kingdom, through the paces of a standard dressage test to demonstrate the horse's obedience.

She scored 48.10 penalty points despite a mistake toward the beginning of her canter in the first ""flying change."" In the stride, the horse is supposed to change the sequence of his steps from side to side, but High Kingdom didn't respond immediately to Phillips' cues.

Cheers and applause broke out as she rode into the stadium and erupted when she finished. Anne, wearing a bright red canvas hat to protect against the strong sun, applauded politely at the end.

Despite the mis-step, Phillips said she was pleased with the performance.

82,82,FL-2012-000121-CHN,Hard-Charging Australian Submarine Temporarily Sidelined During RIMPAC 2012 by Leak Causing Minor Flooding - Defense Update,https://defense-update.com/20120728_farncomb_flooded_rimpac.html,"The HMAS Farncomb (SSG 74), an Australian Collins-class submarine, has put on quite a thrilling demonstration of her warfighting capabilities during the Rim of the Pacific 2012 (RIMPAC 2012) international maritime training exercise giving Australian national pride a welcome boost.

On 23 July HMAS Farncomb closed in on its prey, the 12,106 ton decommissioned USNS Kilauea (T-AE-26), and sank her in forty minutes with one MK48 torpedo. HMAS Farncomb’s single torpedo struck the USNS Kilauea just below the bridge breaking the vessel in two before she slipped beneath the waves some forty minutes after being hit. The decommissioned former ammunition ship sank in 15,500 feet of water 63 miles off the coast of Kauai Island in the Hawaiian Archipelago.

The sinking of the target ship was the highlight of a very successful Australian naval performance in RIMPAC 2012. Australia’s RIMPAC Combined Forces Maritime Component Commander, Commodore Stuart Mayer, stated that the Farncomb has performed exceptionally well against the US Los Angeles-class nuclear-powered “hunter-killer” submarines during this year’s RIMPAC exercise, a performance he says has come as quite a surprise to the assemblage of international naval officers participating in the exercise.





HMAS Farncomb is one of the largest conventionally-powered submarines in the world renowned for its undersea agility and quiet operation. In head-to-head competitions against American Los Angeles-class submarines, Commodore Mayer said the Farncomb frequently emerged victorious and said the vessel is “doing extremely well” in all aspects of the exercise. Commodore Mayer also said that foreign submariners were quite anxious to test themselves against the finely-tuned Farncomb crew. The Commodore further stated that the Farncomb had been developed into an exceptional warfighter that employed state-of-the-art combat systems and sophisticated weapon’s delivery systems incorporated into the vessel with American assistance.

Only two days after sinking the Kilauea, the Farncomb was herself the victim of a mishap while engaged in combat training. According to the Australian Defense Force (ADF), the Farncomb experienced flooding while cruising at periscope depth during an exercise. The flooding was identified as minor resulting from a shipboard water hose that unexpectedly split. At the time of the incident, the submarine was traveling just below the ocean surface under the power of her diesel engines while recharging her onboard batteries.

In a public statement, the ADF stated that the ship “suffered a minor flood in one of the submarine’s machinery spaces,” an event that triggered the immediate execution of standard procedures designed to guarantee the safety of the boat and the crew. In compliance with standard operating procedures, the ship’s captain ordered the vessel to surface as a precautionary measure.

The near sinking of the HMAS Dechaineux caused by the failure of a seawater cooling hose in 2003 led to the installation of an automated system in other undersea craft designed to close all hull valves should a similar mishap occur. The automated system was installed on the Farncomb and was readily available for use. Once the Farncomb surfaced, the crew was able to trace the flooding to a split hose in the boat’s weight compensation system. The damage to the hose was quickly contained to ensure the Farncomb remained seaworthy. The Farncomb was forced to retire from the ongoing exercises and sail for Hawaii to effect repairs to the damaged hose. An investigation will be conducted into the circumstanced of the incident.

This is not the first incident requiring the Farncomb to return to base for repairs. In 2010, the ship suffered a generator failure forcing her to return to port for immediate repairs.

83,83,FL-2012-000121-CHN,United States and Mexico in disagreement with border fence - Costa Rica Star News - The Costa Rica Star,https://news.co.cr/united-states-and-mexico-in-disagreement-with-border-fence/11200/,"An agency that monitors the U.S.-Mexico boundary is agreeing to a U.S. proposal to build border fence segments in a South Texas flood plain, a move Mexico opposes.

The decision by the U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission comes despite objections from its Mexican counterpart. Mexico argues the fence would deflect floodwaters to its side of the Rio Grande and violate a bi-national treaty.

The Associated Press on Tuesday obtained a letter the commission sent to U.S. Customs and Border Protection noting it will not oppose the project. The commission says its analysis found that the fence proposed for three areas in South Texas would not be a significant obstruction to river waters. Half of the 14 miles proposed would be in the flood plain.

“When it comes right down to it, the scientific analysis is what we have to fall back on,” John Merino, principal engineer with the U.S. commission, said Tuesday.

In his February letter, Merino wrote that after a thorough review, the agency concluded that the project “will not cause significant deflection or obstruction of the normal or flood flows of the Rio Grande” and is consistent with the treaty.

Jenny Burke, a spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said that one of the segments, in Los Ebanos, is no longer considered necessary and more funding is needed to build the other two in Rio Grande City and Roma. Merino also pointed out that the government would have to bring back detailed construction drawings of the fence for approval before proceeding.

Still, the green light for a permanent fence made of spaced vertical steel tubes is a significant reversal for an agency that expressed concerns when the government was still proposing a “moveable” fence in 2008.

A 1970 treaty between the United States and Mexico called on both countries to prohibit the building of anything that “may cause deflection or obstruction of the normal flow of the river or of its flood flows.”

In July 2008, Al Riera, then the principal operations engineer for the U.S. boundary commission, told a citizens forum, “If they (Department of Homeland Security) don’t show us they have something in place to guarantee removal of the (fence) panels … the commission would never agree to something like that.”

That movable fence was planned to involve a base of concrete barriers topped with about 15 feet of tightly woven steel fencing that could be removed in advance of floodwaters.

Merino said the project had not been analyzed when Riera made those comments. Riera is no longer with the commission.

But a letter from a Mexican engineer to Merino in December 2011 said the project represented a serious obstruction.

“The location, alignment and design of the proposed fence represent a clear obstruction of the Rio Grande hydraulic area, since in the towns of Rio Grande City and Roma, (Texas), the fence would occupy nearly all of the hydraulic area on the U.S. side, causing the deflection of flows towards the Mexican side,” wrote principal engineer Luis Antonio Rascon Mendoza.

Jesus Luevano, secretary of the commission’s Mexican section, said in an email Tuesday that Mexico’s position is that the “wall constitutes an obstruction of the normal current … in terms of the 1970 Boundary Treaty, therefore we continue fighting its placement with respect to the Rio Grande flood zone.”

He added that Mexico recognizes the border fence is a unilateral endeavor, but said it wasn’t improving relations between the neighbors.

The U.S. has built about 650 miles of border barriers along the 1,954-mile U.S.-Mexico boundary. In Texas, the fence segments have been built more than a mile away from the river in some rural areas, but the three segments recently reviewed by the commission would be built closer because all three communities abut the river. In 2008, the Department of Homeland Security waived a host of environmental regulations to allow speedy construction.

Merino said the disagreement stems from differing assumptions. He said Mexico looks at the fence as a solid barrier like a dam that would not allow water to pass through. U.S. engineers believe water will pass through it as long as it’s kept free of debris.

Jeffrey Ruch, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, or PEER, said he will send a letter to the commission Wednesday demanding an explanation for the agency’s new position. He noted that the proposed fencing would cut through a national wildlife refuge.

“We don’t know the reason that all of these concerns evaporated,” Ruch said Tuesday.

She lost the Lower Fiennes Avenue residence she shared with her significant other and three of her children by fire, and she is beseeching the public to assist her in rebuilding her life.

Sage – who spoke exclusively with SKNVibes – explained that she secured her home sometime before 9:00 that morning and vacated the premises bound for her place of work – the St. Kitts Marriott – when she received word that her house was on fire.

She said she was just meters from her home when someone shouted to her indicating the bad news. She explained that she was in disbelief at first seeing that she had left her home only minutes before. But seeing was believing!

Most of the contents of her home were completely destroyed and the premises is unlivable.

Yet, grateful for life, she walked away from the incident that day with just the clothes on her back and not knowing where she along with her three children (ages two, four and seven years) and her significant other would rest their heads that evening.

“I can’t even describe how I feel. I just wanted to know what was really going on. I was traumatised to the point that I passed out. I am thankful that we are all alive but we need somewhere to stay and we need help with other things.”

Asked what assistance she needs or would appreciate from members of the public, Sage responded “anything people could afford I would accept”.

She said a couple of individuals, including Minister of Social and Community Development, the Honourable Marcella Liburd, have committed to providing assistance for her and her family.

The mother of nine said this incident is particularly difficult for her especially since it brought back memories of a similar incident that occurred 16 years ago. And though she tries to be strong for her children’s sake, the memories of it flood her mind.

“I am trying to keep my mind off of it. I know I lost lots of things but I have to stay strong for my children…

“This is the second time that this happened to me. The first time was in 1996 just after my fourth child was born. I don’t really know what happened but I had just come off of maternity leave and I went work at the hospital and, while there, I was told that my house is on fire. That was on the corner of Central Street and Tibou Avenue.”

As she works to pick up the pieces of her life, Sage offers thanks to God and to those who have already assisted or who have pledged so to do, and is soliciting that of other members of the public.

The detention tank and diversion canal will be located at the upstream of the catchment area.

The diversion canal will divert 38 per cent (240 hectares) of the Stamford Canal catchment towards the Singapore River.

The new detention tank will be built to capture excess storm water from the existing drains along Holland Road. The water will then be pumped back to the drains, to be discharged into the Marina Reservoir via the new diversion canal.

The solutions were identified after a nine-month study to strengthen flood protection for the Stamford Canal Catchment.

The new measures will allow the existing Stamford Canal to serve a smaller catchment area and provide better protection against intense storms.

The diversion canal will run beneath the road surface, starting from Grange Road, along Hoot Kiam Road, River Valley Road and off Kim Seng Road to Singapore River. It will be about two kilometres long.

The detention tank will be built below a proposed nursery and coach park at Tyersall Avenue.

Detailed design for the construction tenders for both measures will be carried out in the second half of 2012, with work on the diversion canal expected to be completed by the end of 2017.

86,86,FL-2012-000121-CHN,Analysis: Small generic drug firms need niches to survive looming price war - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-genericdrugs-specialization-idUSBRE86J0ZI20120720,"(Reuters) - Aggressive consolidation among U.S. and European generic drugmakers is putting pressure on smaller competitors in the industry, whose best hope of surviving a brewing price war may lie in finding specialized niches.

Expiring patents on some of Big Pharma’s top-selling drugs is about to flood the market with cheaper copies, driving dealmaking among larger generics makers like Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Novartis’s Sandoz, Mylan Inc and Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc to gain economies of scale.

At the same time, new regulations in the United States and Europe could cap prices for generic products.

“We are talking here of generics being sold at even below 1 euro ($1.22) a pack in the European Union, and that is simply not sustainable,” said Warwick Smith, the director general of the British Generic Manufacturers Association.

So as larger companies bulk up, smaller ones are left with just a couple of options -- specialize or get leaner to stay competitive.

U.S. companies such as Impax Laboratories Inc and Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co Inc and Europe’s Stada, Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc, Krka and Pharmstandard are expected to feel the pressure of the changing market dynamics, industry analysts said.

Recent deals among large generics producers include Watson’s $5.6 billion acquisition of Swiss drugmaker Actavis Group and Novartis’s purchase of generic dermatology products maker Fougera Pharmaceuticals for $1.5 billion.

“Teva’s acquisition of Ratiopharm and the Watson and Mylan deals that moved them from U.S.-focused operations into more European and global presence -- those are the three that really changed the scenarios,” said Alan Sheppard, head of global generics at IMS Health, a healthcare information provider.

Israel’s Teva, the world’s biggest generic drugs maker, bought Germany’s Ratiopharm in 2010 for 3.6 billion euros, while Mylan significantly expanded its global presence through its 2007 purchase of the generics business of Germany’s Merck KGaA.

IMS expects annual global spending on medicines to rise by a quarter to nearly $1.2 trillion in 2016 from $956 billion in 2011. Global generic spending is forecast to almost double to $400-430 billion by 2016, from $242 billion in 2011.

While Germany’s Stada is seeking deals to catch up with rivals, U.S.-based Par Pharmaceutical Cos Inc said last week that it had agreed to sell itself to private equity firm TPG for $1.9 billion following mounting investor pressure.

Industry analysts say that while deals can be a great way to cut costs and gain market share, small companies can often better compete by turning their smallness into an advantage.

NICHE PROTECTION

Specializing in niche therapeutic areas can protect small companies from sliding prices if, for example, they pick markets with high entry barriers such as injectable drugs, women’s healthcare and psychiatric disorders.

“It is a lot harder, more expensive and needs more technical competence to make an injectable product with ampules, than an oral pill,” Jefferies analyst James Vane-Tempest said.

“So when you are thinking of competition from some of the new market players, then if you are in a segment that is hard to manufacture, there will be fewer competitors,” he added.

Makers of injectable drugs also benefit because hospitals, the biggest buyers of these products, are facing supply shortages as many big companies have stopped producing these low-margin products. Focusing on one therapeutic area also has marketing benefits.

Companies that offer only injectable drugs, rather than a full range of medicines, can still negotiate good prices with hospitals, said Christoph Bieri, an adviser with Turkey-based M&A consultancy firm IMAP.

U.S.-based Hospira Inc and Germany’s Fresenius SE & Co’s generic unit, Kabi, have built successful businesses by specializing in injectables.

Expertise in injectables could also help when the market for biosimilars, or copycat biotechnology drugs, opens up.

Biotechnology medicines are usually administered by injection or infusion, and once U.S. and European regulators iron out the creases in the regulatory pathway for biosimilars, this could open up big opportunities for these companies.

Psychiatric disorders and women’s health are two other areas that have sizeable, yet not highly commoditized, markets -- a promising environment for a mid-sized generic drugmaker.

“In psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and depression, patients have to take the drugs for a very long time. These drugs interfere with each other and each formulation,” IMAP’s Bieri said. “So if you get a psychiatric doctor to prescribe your generic in the beginning, there is a high probability that the patient will stay on that generic even if there is a cheaper alternative found on the market.”

NOOKS & CRANNIES

Differentiation is also crucial to cushioning margins when similar drugs are competing on price, and improved generics, popularly known as super generics, that offer added benefits can command a higher price.

Super generics are essentially tweaked versions of branded drugs that offer advantages over usual copycat drugs, such as Teva’s generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s widely used cancer drug Taxol.

“We have some markets for improved generics, which have a slightly different formulation, so you can digest it better. They taste nicer, they look nicer, they have better packaging and higher compliance,” Bieri said.

Focusing on dominating one market for specific drugs can help small players, as shown by Britain’s Mercury Pharma, which was taken private by private equity firm HgCapital in 2009.

“Mercury has a number of products that are either difficult to make or have very low prices but high volumes; but only in the United Kingdom. This kind of approach could be a big potential for smaller players,” IMS’s Sheppard said.

The emergence of newer drug markets in the developing world have also been talked up as a growth opportunity, but one that may not always be suitable for the smaller companies.

China, India, Brazil and other emerging markets are expected to contribute 28 percent of global spending on medicines by 2015, up from 12 percent in 2005, according to IMS Health.

But while the headline number is big, the individual country markets are fragmented.

“It is going to be a different patient, a different consumer, a different regulatory environment, a different distribution network (in each market),” said David Blumberg, an adviser with audit and advisory firm KPMG.

“Is a small company really ready to tackle all that?”","Fri, 20 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['niches', 'war', 'big', 'market', 'small', 'need', 'billion', 'global', 'looming', 'firms', 'different', 'markets', 'generic', 'price', 'drug', 'generics', 'companies', 'survive', 'drugs']",

Third of five parts

DADAAB, Kenya — His rib cage rose and fell with tight, rapid breaths.

Saad Siyat looked shrunken beneath the hospital blanket. His wide-set eyes rolled up into his head, and his body burned with fever.



The boy was unconscious and convulsing when his aunt brought him to the hospital at Ifo camp, one of five massive camps in eastern Kenya filled with Somali refugees. The family had arrived months earlier after a nearly 300-mile journey across the desert.

Saad was suffering from pneumonia and chronic undernourishment — in particular, a protein deficiency known as kwashiorkor. The name derives from a West African term for “rejected one,” a child pushed from his mother’s breast to make way for a newborn.

Saad was 2½ years old. He weighed 18 pounds.

“This child has been sick a very long time,” Dr. Ibtisam Salim said as she made her rounds in the hospital’s stabilization center, a concrete building filled with emaciated children lying on squeaky metal beds.

She felt Saad’s forehead and questioned his aunt, who was shooing away flies and using a soiled rag to wipe mucus from his oxygen and feeding tubes. The boy’s mother was at home, tending to her seven other children.

Salim gently held up one of his feet, to show the swelling, a classic symptom of protein deficiency.

“Malnutrition opens up a very big window for infection,” Salim said. “It destroys their defenses.”

She heard a gasp and stiffened.

“Excuse me,” she said, wheeling around on her heels and digging in her bag. She pulled out a stethoscope and held it to the boy’s chest.

With the tips of three fingers, she began pumping rapidly on his frail torso.

Around the world, population is rising most rapidly in places where life is most precarious.

Across Africa and in parts of South Asia and Latin America, hundreds of millions of people live on the edge of starvation. A drought, flood or outbreak of violence can push them over the brink.

Many end up on the march, crossing borders in search of relief. Some arrive in places like Dadaab, famished and desperately ill. Millions more are displaced within their own countries.

They represent one face of hunger in a world that, on paper at least, produces enough food to feed all 7 billion inhabitants.

Somalia, a nation of 10 million, has one of the highest birthrates in the world, averaging 6.4 children per woman. Runaway population growth, food scarcity and political strife have combined to cause a mass exodus. One-fourth of Somalis have fled their homes.

Last year, during the worst of a three-year drought, shortage turned to famine. Forty percent of Somali children who reached the refugee camps in Dadaab were malnourished. Despite emergency feeding and medical treatment, many died within 24 hours.

More commonly, children live on tenuously, the effects of chronic malnutrition masked by the swelling caused by kwashiorkor. By the time their parents realize how sick they are and take them to the camp hospital, it can be too late.

It has been four decades since advances in agriculture known as the Green Revolution seemed to promise relief from this kind of mass suffering.

An American plant breeder named Norman Borlaug won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for helping to develop high-yield, disease-resistant varieties of wheat and other grains, making it possible to triple harvests around the world.

Mankind finally seemed to be gaining ground on its longtime nemesis: pervasive hunger.

Yet Borlaug cautioned against hubris: “The frightening power of human reproduction must also be curbed,” he said. “Otherwise, the success of the Green Revolution will be ephemeral only.”

Today, with nearly twice as many people on the planet, his words seem sadly prescient.

The farms have dried up. Some people had died of starvation.” — Shamsa Adow Hassan, a Somali refugee

Nearly 1 billion people are malnourished, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. At least 8 million die every year of hunger-related diarrhea, pneumonia and other illnesses — more than succumb to AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. A child dies of hunger every 11 seconds.

In raw volume, the world’s farmers produce enough food for everyone. People go hungry in developing countries because they can’t afford to buy food and can’t grow enough on their own. Inadequate transportation and storage aggravate shortages.

By midcentury, global food production could simply be insufficient. There will be at least 2 billion more mouths to feed, and an expanding middle class will consume more grain-fed beef, pork and other meats.

To meet the demand, the world’s farmers will have to double their crop production by 2050, according to researchers’ calculations.

Jonathan Foley, a University of Minnesota climatologist, says it’s the challenge of the 21st century: “How will we feed 9 billion people without destroying the planet?”

Most of Earth’s best farmland is already under cultivation, and prime acreage is being lost every year to expanding cities and deserts, contamination from agricultural chemicals and other causes.

Carving large new tracts of farmland out of the world’s remaining forests and grasslands would exact a heavy toll, destroying wildlife and unleashing climate-warming gases now locked in soils and vegetation.

Complicating the problem is that rivers and aquifers are running dry, and heat waves and droughts associated with global warming are withering crops. Pests and diseases thought to have been vanquished are bedeviling farmers again, often in more virulent forms.

Major international research projects are underway to develop hybrid crops to withstand these challenges. But such efforts take decades, and there is no guarantee of success.

“The easy things have been done,” said Nina V. Fedoroff, a biotechnology expert at Pennsylvania State University. “The problems that are left are hard.”

The traditional low-tech solution to hunger — mass migration —is increasingly impractical on a crowded planet.

The looming crisis is expected to be most severe in Africa, where birthrates are high and where the Green Revolution never took hold. By midcentury, the continent’s population is expected to double — to 2 billion.

Africa already is home to nearly 30% of the planet’s chronically hungry. About 400 million people in sub-Saharan Africa live on less than $1.25 a day, most of which is spent on food.

Increasingly, they are competing with the appetites of wealthier nations, which are snapping up some of Africa’s best rain-fed farmland to secure long-term food supplies. The U.S., China and other countries are also using more grain to fatten livestock and make ethanol, pushing up prices.

All of this leaves more and more people on the edge.

When it opened in 1991, the camp complex in Dadaab was intended as a temporary shelter for 90,000 Somalis. It now holds the world’s largest concentration of refugees: 472,000 and counting.

On a blistering morning, more than 1,000 new arrivals massed outside the fence. Most had trudged through the desert for days or weeks.

Guards bellowed at the mob with bullhorns and swatted men with switches to herd them into lines. Lone refugees were rare; the lines contained families of eight, 10 or more.

Nearly all the newcomers were skinny, some skeletal. As they shuffled through processing stations, workers measured their outstretched arms for body fat. Children were immunized against measles and polio and given a squirt of vitamin A.

Clutching her ration card in one hand and cradling a 2-month-old girl with the other, Shamsa Adow Hassan said she had fled her riverbank farm in Somalia with her husband and four children.

“The farms have dried up,” said Hassan, 32. “Some people had died of starvation.”

She decided to leave when a rocket struck and killed her father.

At the center of one camp, the new arrivals joined other refugees lining up with empty sacks, plastic jugs and tins to receive two-week rations of food staples. To keep women from being trampled, security officers in white coats put the men in separate lines.

After some jostling and a sprint to the entrance, the refugees made their way through large tunnels similar to cattle chutes, fashioned from barbed wire, chain-link fencing and corrugated metal. Through openings at various intervals, aid workers scooped wheat flour, cornmeal, dried peas, soy protein powder and salt into the refugees’ gunnysacks.

Thousands of tons of food are distributed in these camps every year by the U.N.'s World Food Program and other aid organizations. The U.S. government pays most of the cost. Worldwide, the U.N. program feeds an average of 90 million people per year.

On this day, not far from the chutes, Mohamed Abdi Yussuf was holding forth, encircled by some of the camps’ younger leaders. They were talking about crowding, the lack of water and a shortage of flour.

Even so, Yussuf said he wanted to have as many children as possible.

At 26, with three children, he is just getting started.

How many does he want? “Seventy,” he said. “Sixty boys and 10 girls.”

This brought some tittering from his fellow youth leaders. He didn’t crack a smile.

“I think these guys will support me,” Yussuf said. “Our elders, our fathers, had many children. It’s a common idea.”

He hadn’t consulted his 21-year-old wife and said he planned to divorce her before she turns 40.

“When she stops breeding, I will jump to another young lady.”

Asked how he would provide for all those children, Yussuf shrugged.

“I don’t worry what the children will feed on,” he said. “They have their own fate. They have their own mouths, teeth. God knows what to put in there.”

James Mukunga worries every day about how to feed his children.

Outside Dadaab, across the arid expanses of East Africa, farmers like him are struggling to provide for large families. Once-fertile grasslands have been overgrazed and trampled by herds of goats and cows.

Mukunga lives with his wife and 12 children, 27 goats and one donkey on a small farm 200 miles from the refugee camps.

The skinny Kenyan farmer wore tattered clothes and kicked at a shriveled patch of millet with sandals fashioned from car tires. Stunted stalks of corn, sorghum and other plants poked through sun-baked clay.

This year, like the one before, his crop had failed because of drought. “Since 2004, we have not had a reasonable harvest,” Mukunga said.

The family chopped down their few remaining trees to make charcoal to sell. Otherwise, they subsist on donated food from the United States. Their small granary is empty but for a few spent cans of vegetable oil labeled “USAID.”

Mukunga wonders if his goats, a source of meat and milk, will survive another dry year.

The family gets its water from a village borehole four miles away. It was a mob scene on this hot day. Dozens of women toting jerrycans waited in the shade of an acacia tree, next to herds of scrawny goats and cattle. A cow licked an empty spigot.

The water pump had run out of diesel fuel, and a few men had gone off to find some.

Hours passed as the thirsty waited for relief.





At the hospital at Ifo camp in Dadaab, Dr. Salim used her fingers to spread Saad’s upper and lower eyelids and shined a light into a pupil. Then she went back to work, compressing his chest.

Somali women covered head to toe in brightly colored scarves and dresses crowded around the bed.

A nurse squeezed through with a syringe of adrenaline.

“He’s gasping,” Salim said, tilting Saad’s head back to open his airways.

The boy’s aunt, with large frightened eyes, climbed onto the bed, squatting on her haunches. She poured water into his mouth from a red plastic cup.

“Mama, please, please, please ... Mama, please,” Salim said, gently moving the woman’s arm out of the way.

The doctor continued the chest compressions, faster now.

An assistant brought a hand-pumped respirator. Salim placed a clear plastic mask over the boy’s nose and mouth and began squeezing the bag.

As she pumped air into his lungs, she handed her stethoscope to a nurse and said: “Listen — listen to the heart.”

She watched as the nurse leaned over the child.

“Is there any heartbeat?”

The nurse met her gaze with a weary expression that left no doubt.

“There isn’t,” Salim said.

The doctor stepped away from the bed, leaned against the wall and silently wept.

In his first trip to the AIBA world championships last November in Azerbaijan, Herring lost his opening match to China's Hu Qing, 20-5, and after he reached the semifinals in the Americas qualifier in May in Brazil to make the Olympics, the Long Islander lost to Puerto Rico's Francisco Vargas, 11-6.

As Herring has learned, there is a difference in boxing styles between American and international tournaments.

""Most of the amateurs in America have a pro style and will go with you toe to toe, but the amateurs in Europe and Asia do a lot of pop shots and run,"" Herring said. ""In international competition, you have to show a really effective blow for the judges to give you a point. You have to sit down and put some impact behind your punches for the judges to see.

""I feel I've gotten a lot better. A lot of coaches who have seen me from the Olympic trials [in 2011] to now feel I'm stronger and better.""

Jesse Ravelo, who coached the 1996 U.S. Olympic team and now runs the Marines' boxing program, has spent the past four years working with Herring to develop his power to impress international judges whose input to the computer system determines the final score of the three-round matches.

""You've got to beat the computer,"" Ravelo said. ""I had him develop that power so that, when he hits somebody, that head either jerks or the body jerks and you get that point.""

Herring admitted he let down at the Americas qualifier once he made the Olympics, but he figures the hard road back from the loss at the worlds to reach London will help him with the medals on the line.

""I've had a lot of experience in this sport now, a lot of ups and downs,"" Herring said. ""I've been through the worst. This will be my last amateur showcase, so, let's finish strong and go to the next level.""

Herring's first bout is scheduled for Tuesday, but his opponent won't be known until after the boxers make weight. He needs to win three matches to reach the medal round.

After the Olympics, Herring's Marine Corps career ends in November, and that's when he plans to start a pro career at the late-blooming age of 27. So there's pressure on him to have a strong showing in London.

""He's got everything he needs to be able to medal,"" Ravelo said. ""He'll have a tough time with the Eastern European boxers, Ukraine, the Cubans, the Germans. But he has what it takes to beat anybody.

""I told him, 'Your future is not making the Olympic team. Your future is to medal.' That's what promoters look at. If he wants to make it in the professional business, he needs to medal and do well there.""","Wed, 18 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.3753717.1339883101!/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/landscape_1280/image.JPG,"['ravelo', 'needs', 'competition', 'corams', 'jamel', 'international', 'thats', 'medal', 'lot', 'olympics', 'sizing', 'herring', 'judges', 'olympic']",

To bring the two closer together, he recommends three tools for policymakers and development programmers: integrated river basin management and basin planning; payments for watershed services (also known as payments for environmental services ); and population, health, and environment (PHE) programming.“The causal link between WASH and ecosystem health and integrity is most accentuated whendealing with freshwater ecosystems,” writes Bonnardeaux.In Tanzania’s Pangani River Basin , one of his in-depth case studies, a growing reliance on hydropower, urbanization, and increased agricultural demand is altering a valuable ecosystem marked by endemism and iconic landscapes, including Mount Kilimanjaro.In response, the government and international organizations are partnering through the Pangani River Basin Management Project to developing a greater understanding of the basin’s hydrology and ecosystem, how local populations interact with that ecosystem, and how potential development scenarios could impact the basin in the future. That knowledge, paired with an intensive training program for local water officials, is enabling stronger integrated resource management, which in turn could lay the groundwork for integrating WASH and conservation interventions, writes Bonnardeaux.Economic incentives – in this case, payments for watershed services – offer another valuable tool for building support for conservation efforts, especially when upstream communities bear a disproportionate burden of safeguarding watersheds.In South Africa, another case study country, “increased economic development and urbanization have taken its toll on” the country’s wetlands, while unemployment and poverty have remained a persistent problem in slum areas, writes Bonnardeaux. Through the government-run Working for Wetlands program, both the environmental and socioeconomic problems of development are being targeted for improvement. The program hires “the most marginalized from society” to clear wetlands of invasive plants in order to improve its natural filtration capabilities and, in turn, improves the quality of water feeding the burgeoning urban areas.Although Working for Wetlands, now 17 years old, has been “hugely successful,” Bonnardeaux warns that such economic incentive programs are, more often than not, extremely difficult to carry out effectively. “While there is great potential for this incentive-based conservation approach,” Bonnardeaux notes, “the reality is there are many barriers to its effective implementation.”Building support for conservation can be a difficult task. The impacts of conservation programming are “often undervalued,” Bonnardeaux writes, in part because results tend to become apparent only over the longer term. By pairing conservation efforts with nearer-term programming, like PHE efforts targeting immediate health needs, development workers can foster the kind of local support that is essential for pursuing long term goals.The Jane Goodall Institute’s Lake Tanganyika Catchment Reforestation and Education Project (TACARE), in northwest Tanzania, offers a case in point. Established in 1994, TACARE began as a conservation program meant to protect the areas around Gombe National Park , where Goodall first began her chimpanzee research in the 1960s. Local communities, however, were more interested in better health, “with an emphasis on clear water and reduction in water-borne diseases like cholera,” writes Bonnardeaux.By adopting local health and poverty priorities, he writes, TACARE was able to establish trust and goodwill with the communities it served, which in turn enabled it to pursue longer-term conservation goals aimed at protecting the region’s natural biodiversity.Bonnardeaux’s work shows that regardless of how policymakers choose to combine WASH and conservation goals, well-implemented integration can yield immense benefits for practitioners, funders, and local communities.“Linking various sectors such as WASH, forestry, agriculture, population, and community development,” he writes, “can result in cost and effort sharing which in turn can increase the effectiveness of the project including improved conservation and improved livelihoods and health.”","Fri, 28 Aug 2015 21:48:58 GMT",https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/century_city-300x195.png,"['bonnardeaux', 'development', 'local', 'health', 'turn', 'africa', 'linking', 'writes', 'ecosystem', 'services', 'water', 'subsaharan', 'biodiversity', 'conservation', 'sanitation', 'wash']",

AS a child growing up in the commercial city of Aba, Abia state in the early eighties, I knew the city had a lot of environmental challenges that appeared insurmountable at a time, despite several efforts by successive governments in the state to tackle them.

It was obvious, however, to the residents then that governments were not committed and sincere in tackling the problems.

Top on the list of the environmental challenges in the city then were flooding and refuse disposal. Both of them posed serious threat to our health and environmental wellbeing even as we no choice but to endure the hazard. Apart from the indiscriminate dumping of refuse at almost every corner, the odour oozing out from it was enough to make one sick all the time.

As more people trooped into the city for commercial activities and other means of eking out a living, the more the challenges took a dangerous dimension, as there were no places for refuse disposal.

So most times residents dump their refuse into the drainage, especially at night, believing it would be washed away by flood when it rained. Some streets and roads were taken over by heaps of refuse and people avoided using such roads and streets for fear of being infected.

It was a situation that worsened the environmental challenges in the city as most drainage channels were totally blocked, making it possible for flood to take over majority of the roads in the city whenever it rained.

I could remember how our parents would always prevent us from going out whenever it was raining to avoid being carried away by flood or being infected in the contaminated flood.

That was my experience and that of my people in the city then. By the time I finished my secondary education in the early nineties I left the city for further education in Enugu, though I visited there occasionally to buy clothes while I was in the university because of the presence of good tailors there.

With the return of democracy in 1999, I had thought that the city and state capital, Umuahia, would receive adequate attention from the state government, especially in tackling the environmental challenges.

But disappointedly I didn’t witness such intervention from the government when I visited the city again in 2005 while doing my national youth service programme in Cross River State. One of my friends there told me that the government had continued to promise the residents of plans to clear the heaps of refuse at various dump sites that had become an eye sore, but nothing was ever done.

So it was a hopeless situation in Aba and for years I didn’t go there again until recently when I was in Umuahia for some days on official duty. Every morning from my hotel room window, I saw some waste disposal trucks with the inscription of the Abia State Environment Protection Agency, ASEPA, carrying waste and some street sweepers sweeping the roads and watering the flowers planted on the dualised roads in the capital. On inquiry how such development was made possible and whether such has been extended to the commercial city of Aba, I was informed that the present government in the state made it possible with the revival of ASEPA and equipping the agency with the necessary facilities, including more than 28 waste disposal trucks, Eco poer truck, tippers, receptacles, bulldozers, graders, domestic waste bins, weight waste containers, motor vehicle waste basket, bio-degradable waste bag and others.

This was after the state government terminated the arrangement it entered into with Phoenix Environmental Service Limited for failure to live up to expectation in managing refuse in Aba. The government later entered into agreement with ANCOLD Environmental to work in partnership with ASEPA to ensure the clearing of waste disposal in Aba.

Based on the popular adage which says that “seeing is believing”, I made out time and visited Aba to see things myself and also see some of my friends after some years. On getting to the city, right from the popular and notorious Osisioma Junction, it was obvious that there was a massive improvement in the tackling of environmental challenges in the city. Flowers have been planted at junctions with a beautification design and demarcation I found very attractive. There was no traffic jams or congestion at the junction right down to the Aba/Owerri road. Most of the known refuse dump sites in the city were empty, with disposal trucks on every street packing waste. Most of the drainage channels were cleared and clean. I could not believe that it was the same filthy city I left few years ago.

I learnt also that ASEPA introduced a unique waste sorting device known as medical waste management devise, a very special environmental management approach designed for sorting out medical-related waste for effective disposal. My friends told me that residents who infringe on environmental laws are charged to mobile courts established by the state government.

This, I was told, has made the residents of the city, especially traders, to change their attitude towards managing refuse to avoid incurring the wrath of the law. So in Aba and Umuahia today, the fear of ASEPA is the beginning of wisdom for the residents, especially those who are not ready to obey the environmental laws of keeping their environments clean all the times.

The state government’s spirited effort in managing waste in the state now, especially in Aba and Umuahia, is commendable and the residents should complement them by adhering strictly to the rules of the game in disposing their refuse because it is no longer business as usual.

The July 17 edition of the U.S. Drought Monitor showed more than half of Indiana in the two most-severe drought categories.

By Brett Walton

Circle of Blue

Indiana has a big great smear of Hoosier red covering half the state. That color swath — running from the northeast corner to the southwestern tip — indicates, per the classification system used by the U.S. Drought Monitor, an “extreme” drought, or one that occurs roughly once every 20 to 33 years.

Because of this, on July 18, Indiana’s Department of Natural Resources issued a water-shortage warning and asked facilities that withdraw large amounts of water to make voluntary reductions of 10 to 15 percent. Some cities are doing so; others say their water sources are adequate. Just one town has declared a water emergency.

“A lot of these systems are already doing things to conserve water,” said Amy Hartsock, a public information officer for the Department of Environmental Management, which asked 4,200 drinking water utilities in the state about their water supply status. As of July 16, 10 utilities reported that they might face supply or capacity problems in the near future.

“We’re continuing to monitor the situation. But right now, things are ok.” –Allen Mounts

Water Department Director

Evansville, Indiana

Indiana’s drought map appears uniform — bands of autumnal color, like on a corn snake — but the consequences of persistently dry weather are anything but. Drought affects different sectors at different times and in different ways. For municipal users, the burden of drought depends on what water supply source the city uses: rivers, reservoirs, or groundwater.

Evansville, in the state’s southwest tip, has not set any restrictions. The city of 117,000 draws its water from the Ohio River, one of the nation’s largest by discharge. Allen Mounts, the water department director, told Circle of Blue that the Ohio’s size makes it a more reliable source, compared to cities that draw from smaller rivers.

“We’re continuing to monitor the situation.” he said. “But right now, things are ok.”

Restrictions

In the state capital, however, mandatory water restrictions have been in place since July 13. Indianapolis, which relies on reservoirs, has prohibited outdoor water use, except for hand-watering of vegetable gardens and flowers.

The effect has been swift and significant.

Before the restrictions, the city was using roughly 757,000 cubic meters (200 million gallons) per day. In June, all-time daily water-use records were broken — twice. Sarah Holsapple, a press officer for Citizens Energy Group, which operates the water system, said that demand is now just 541,000 cubic meters (143 million gallons) per day, a 28.5 percent reduction.

“It is safe to say that the majority of the drop in usage is due to the watering ban,” Holsapple wrote in an email.

According to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, the only town to declare a water emergency is Osgood, 110 kilometers (70 miles) southeast of the capital. Outdoor water use there has also been banned.

“It is safe to say that the majority of the drop in usage is due to the watering ban.” –Sarah Holsapple, press officer

Citizens Energy Group

Chuck Gill, Osgood’s water superintendent, told Circle of Blue that Laughery Creek, which feeds the town’s reservoir, is running low, and the restrictions are a precautionary measure. “We have a 140- to 160-day supply in the reservoir currently,” Gill said.

Of course, this drought is quite young — only a few months old — and it comes on the heels of Indiana’s wettest year on record, so reservoirs were brimming at the start. When the dry months turn into dry years, then the real struggles could emerge. For now though, most cities enjoy a large buffer between demands and essential needs.

Lawns may wither, but the drought is not yet a municipal crisis.

“Conservation — that’s our message,” said Hartsock, of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management.","Wed, 25 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.circleofblue.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Indiana-drought-monitor.png,"['monitor', 'restrictions', 'cities', 'reservoirs', 'indianas', 'things', 'drought', 'water', 'department', 'state', 'supply', 'cope', 'say', 'conservation']",

The bill for weather damage in June equates to about £17million for each day

Dry and fine weather will arrive this weekend with highs of 23C on Sunday

Insurers will pay £500million to those affected by floods and storms last month.

The news comes ahead of more rain today – but forecasters predict most areas will be dry and sunny by the weekend.

Temperatures are expected to reach 23C (73F) on Sunday and 25C (77F) on Monday for most of eastern and southern England, although there is a chance of showers in the north and west.

Sadly, the summery conditions could be short-lived, with more unsettled weather predicted to move in from the west on Tuesday.



This may, however, clear before the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games next Friday.

Yesterday saw more heavy rainfall, with up to 1.2in – the equivalent of two weeks’ worth – falling in some places.

But Helen Rossington, a forecaster at MeteoGroup, said: ‘We should see an improvement this weekend.

‘Saturday is when the high pressure should start building, with sunny spells, and showers should be few and far between.



'Sunday will be a warm day reaching 23C in eastern England, and should be mostly dry and bright for the south.



'It could be even warmer on Monday, with temperatures up to 25C.’



A dry end to July would be good news for insurance firms. The bill for weather damage in June equates to about £17million for each day, according to figures from the Association of British Insurers.

The situation is precarious because the monsoon has delivered normal rainfall to only one-third of the country. The total deficit so far this season is 22%, but rainfall has been 40% below average in key crop-growing areas in the north and northwest. India's 84 important reservoirs are filled only to 19% capacity, which is 41% lower than last year.

Officials said the situation can rapidly improve if the monsoon revives as forecast by the weather office, but the El Nino phenomenon, which is expected to set in after a month, can make things worse.

""The reservoir situation is similar to conditions in 2009 when the country faced one of the worst droughts in 100 years. It will definitely have adverse impact on agriculture, not only on summer crops but also on rabi crops that need irrigation from reservoirs. The power scenario will also take a hit,"" RC Jha, chairman of the Central Water Commission, told ET.

The commission is the central government's top body for coordinating schemes for water resources, irrigation, drinking water and flood forecasting.The reservoir level is ""dangerous"" and needs urgent action, said Ashok Gulati, chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices and former director of the markets, trade and institutions division of Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute. ""The waiting period is over now. It's time to take action. Reservoirs are at dangerous levels as rains have been scanty. We should not wait for August first week to announce contingency plans in the affected areas,"" he said.But Agriculture Secretary Ashish Bahuguna said reservoirs were filling up and the situation would improve further in the weeks ahead.The reservoirs are filled by monsoon rains from June to September. The storage in the Bhakra dam, which irrigates the bread basket states of Punjab and Haryana, is barely 22% of capacity, down from 48% at the same time last year, forcing the Bhakra Beas Management Board to cut water supply by 10%. This will hit paddy and coarse cereals sown in these two states. Depleted reservoirs and weak rainfall can hurt winter planting because fields would have inadequate moisture and crops sown after the monsoon depend almost entirely on water flowing out of reservoirs.The country has the capacity to store 250 billion cubic metre (bcm) of water, and adds new capacity of 7-8 bcm every year. But this is not adequate to tap annual rainfall of over 4,000 bcm.Jha said China has 4-5 times of India's storage capacity while Russia has storage capacity to meet any exigency. The commission, which monitors 60% of the water storage through 84 reservoirs, is expanding its coverage and doubling the number of reservoirs to 177 in the next one year, which will cover 85% of water stored in total of 5,100 dams in the country, he said.""We are also planning to scale up our capacity to 450 bcm by setting up new reservoirs and dams. At present, 583 dams are under construction which will add up storage capacity of 50 bcm. Half of these projects will serve dual purpose - hydropower generation as well as irrigation,"" Jha said.The agriculture secretary said building new capacity would be justified if existing tanks are full, but experts said it is important to store rainwater to build a cushion to withstand drought-like conditions.Jha said some states are already facing water shortage. ""Scarcity of drinking water may arise by February-March next year if rains remain erratic. In states like Maharashtra and Karnataka, people have started facing this problem,"" he said. The government has asked state governments to take immediate action for ensuring availability of water in view of depleting reservoir levels. Water use for irrigation has been cut in several states to meet drinking water requirements""Even if situation improves in subsequent weeks as the weather office is forecasting, there will be not much cushion for imminent kharif loss. We will save water for rabi crops,"" Jha said.","Mon, 23 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-15098163,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-93184,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg","['states', 'monsoon', 'capacity', 'stares', 'reservoirs', 'country', 'water', 'rainfall', 'drinking', 'crisis', 'india', 'crops', 'situation', 'storage']",

“Top Chef, Chopped, Restaurant Impossible,” he says. “Top Chef because I like the quick thinking in the quick fire challenge. Chopped the same, I like the quick thinking of what to make with the mystery basket. Chefs have to be creative on the fly. Restaurant Impossible is to see what not to do.”

In fact, Chopped and Iron Chef seem to be the most popular shows for chefs.

In fact, Chopped and Iron Chef seem to be the most popular shows for chefs.

“Even though every chef's hours are long and free time is hard, I make sure to record the series Chopped and Iron Chef,” says chef Roberto Castre of Latin Bites. “Both shows are entertaining and I love to see how each chef showcases their creativity. The dishes they come up with are spectacular and I am always impressed in how short of time they do it.”

Sweet Vanessa O’Donnell of Ooh La La Dessert Boutique has a personal connection to some shows.

“While I was in Dallas attending the home and garden show, I attended a cooking demonstration by chef Curtis Stone and got an opportunity to meet him,” she says. “Not only do I like Curtis Stone because he is easy on the eye, but I have thoroughly enjoyed watching him on Top Chef Masters and Around the World in 80 Plates.”

She also likes Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and, of course, Cupcake Wars.

“Because it is what I do. And I hope to one day compete on the show.”

But not all chefs watch food shows.

“I actually don't have a TV,” says German Mosquera of Roots Bistro and the newly opened Roots Juice. “And most chefs I know don't actually have time to watch cooking shows. But I get a lot out of YouTube and enjoy shorts with Ferran Adria from El Bulli, and we recently watched all of the TED talks Food series, which was really inspiring.”

“I haven’t watched much in the last three years,” says Lynette Hawkins of Giacomo’s cibo e vino. “I guess the younger chefs do, but by the time I get home I just want to relax.”

But she did used to love the shows that really taught you about how to cook: Too Hot Tamales, the early Emeril Lagasse shows and Two Fat Ladies.

“Their food was terrible, everything slathered in bacon, but they were so funny!

“But those shows used to be about teaching cooking, now it’s all about celebrity chefs and entertainment.”

Whatever your food porn faves are, you’ll want to catch PBS’s tribute to Julia Child starting Aug. 5. Watch, cook and remember why we all loved her.","Sun, 22 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://houston.culturemap.com/favicon.ico,"['hells', 'chefs', 'cooking', 'does', 'houston', 'kitchen', 'recently', 'shows', 'c', 'food', 'really', 'high', 'chef', 'watch', 'chopped']",
