Linkedin Rizal Harahap (The Jakarta Post) Pekanbaru, Riau ● Fri, December 20, 2019 19:57 529 d50837afe27bdfc76176ae4c9c30a0db 1 National Riau,emergency-relief,floods,BNPB,BPBD Free

The Riau administration declared a state of emergency on Friday after water inundated hundreds of villages in six of the province’s regencies, affecting more than 62,000 residents in the latest among recent disasters that have killed at least six people.

Riau Secretary Yan Prana Jaya Indra Rasyid said the status was enforced to prepare for a possible worst-case scenario due to the disaster, which occurred after waters overflowed from four of the province’s large rivers.

The emergency status applies for 11 days from Dec. 20 until 30.

“With the state of emergency, the regional administration could no longer cite financial difficulties in disaster-handling measures because the central government will provide support through the National Mitigation Agency [BNPB],” Yan said.

As of Friday, the overflowing waters from Riau’s Kampak, Siak, Rokan and Indragiri rivers inundated at least 216 villages in 43 districts in the regencies of Rokan Hulu, Kampar, Rokan Hilir, Pelalawan, Kuantan Singingi and Indragiri Hulu.

As many as 25,133 households comprising 62,630 people in the six regencies were affected by floods, which inundated 8,798 houses, 11 kindergartens, 47 elementary schools, 19 junior high schools and 17 senior high schools, according to Riau administration data.

The Riau Disaster Mitigation Agency recorded six casualties to date in floods and landslides that had occurred over several weeks.

Two people were killed after being trapped in a landslide and three died after being washed away by floods in Rokan Hulu, while another one died after drowning in a flood in Kuantan Singigi.

Some affected regencies reportedly declared states of emergency days before the provincial administration did on Friday.

“We have set up a number of temporary shelters and field kitchens in several areas,” Yan said.

While risks of forest fires threaten the province during the dry season, Riau is prone to floods and landslides during the rainy season. Severe floods could hit the province twice a year, he said.

""Floods usually occur at the beginning and the end of the year. The main reason behind [the disaster] is deforestation; there are fewer and fewer trees that can absorb the rainwater,” he said, “The water flows straight to the river and overflows into residential areas.”

In urban areas, a lack of drainage systems has exacerbated flooding problems. Yan noted that, in some parts, systems were developed without Environmental Impact Analysis (Amdal).

Yan therefore made a call for Riau residents to immediately inform local authorities when their area gets hit by a flood so that disaster mitigation personnel and aid could be deployed immediately.

Meanwhile, BNPB director of equipment Rustian said the Riau provincial administration had made the correct decision by declaring state of emergency.

""The status gives legal protection for transfers of funds from the BNPB to help flood and landslide victims in the province,"" he said.

Even though the emergency fund has been put on standby for emergency use, Rustian said local authorities should not save their resources for bigger disasters.

""They should solve the [floods] problem from its roots and keep looking for the best and most sustainable solutions for the future,"" he said.

Pekanbaru Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) data and information head Marzuki predicted that rainfall would continue to hit the province until January, most likely occurring every morning and night.

""Rain will pour all over the province until the end of December. The intensity will decrease in January, particularly in the northern part of Riau,” he said, adding the potential of floods disrupting New Year’s Eve celebrations was slim.

In a bid to save Jakarta from the triple threat of flooding, water shortages and land subsidence, the Jakarta administration is racing to build vertical drainage systems throughout the city.

The administration has built 761 drainage systems, out of the target 1,000 for this year, but it needs 1.8 million to be installed to achieve a flood-free city, based on an administration calculation.

Therefore, the city is calling on residents to help reach that goal.

“What is important is that we make residents aware that they should participate. Residents manage the water overflow within their household while the administration manages the overflow on the road. That is the partnership [needed]. When both parties collaborate, Insya Allah [God willing] Jakarta will be free from flooding and become an example for other cities...","Tue, 17 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2016/07/28/2016_07_28_9059_1469708644._large.jpg,"['flooding', 'conservation', 'city', 'willing', 'drainage', 'flood', 'public', 'administration', 'residents', 'overflow', 'participation', 'systems', 'require', 'jakarta', 'mitigation', 'water']",

Residents of Pranggang village in Kediri, East Java, were shocked to discover that their prized koi, valued at Rp 25 million (US$1,785), were missing after two hours of heavy rains caused their five fish ponds to overflow.

“All of the fish from all of the ponds have been washed away by the flood,” Kediri Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD) operational head Randi Agata said on Tuesday as quoted by kompas.com.

The flood waters also destroyed a 20-meter long, 3-m tall wall along a street and inundated 2 hectares of paddy fields. No casualties were reported.

Randi said the agency was now focused on distributing 12,000 liters of clean water to residents of Badek village, Sepawon village and Plosoklaten district.

The Meterology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) has warned the public that December will likely see bad weather and an increased chance of hydrometeorological disasters, such as floods and landslides, with the rainy season beginning in many regions across the country.

According to the agency, downpours will start hitting many areas across the archipelago during first or second week of December with the rainy season predicted to reach its peak in February and March 2020.

Fortunately, the tides have not been high, and residents in the exposed section of the Indonesian capital’s northern shoreline have not been affected yet. But Takalar knows his luck could run out.

“My worry is that the water is higher than the land,” said Takalar, 46, who said he was concerned for the safety of his teenage daughter when she was alone in their one-roomed home in the poor Muara Baru area of Jakarta.

When the sea breached the levee 12 years ago, he took his family back to their home in Sulawesi.

“When it got better, I returned again,” he said, adding that once his daughter has finished school he might leave the area for good.

Jarot Widyoko, director of rivers and coasts at Indonesia’s public works and public housing ministry, said an investigation was underway into why a 170-metre stretch of the 2.3 km wall near Muara Baru was damaged. It was only built in the last few years.

The incident has thrown a spotlight on efforts to shore up parts of the low-lying city from being inundated in coming years.

Jakarta is slowly sinking due to an over-extraction of ground water causing subsidence, with rising sea levels making the threat of flooding even worse and pushing the city to come up with elaborate programs to protect residents.

In 2014, the government announced a plan to build a giant seawall along the coast as part of a $40 billion project to protect the city until 2030.

The planned seawall, which was part of what had been dubbed the “Great Garuda” for its resemblance to the wing span of the mythical bird, included a stalled plan to build a new city on a string of reclaimed islands in Jakarta bay.

The collapsed section is part of the first of three phases under the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development, which has come in for criticism from environmentalists concerned over the impact on the bay and for not fully addressing land subsidence.

Heri Andreas, an expert on land subsidence at the Bandung Institute of Technology, said land in Muara Baru was sinking at a rate of 12 cm (4.7 inches) per year, one of the fastest in Jakarta.

Uncontrolled extraction of groundwater in Jakarta over the years has caused layers of rock and sediment to slowly pancake on top of each other.

The government announced in August it intends to move the administrative capital to East Kalimantan province, on Borneo island, to relieve Jakarta from “a heavy burden” due to overcrowding and pollution.

Saryad, 59, a street-side vendor, who has lived in the area for four decades, recalled how since he was a kid the sea had now become higher than the road in the area.

But he admits he has few choices and will have to rely on the protection of the sea wall.

4,4,FL-2019-000181-IDN,'I wanted to die too': Sole survivor of Seventeen band carries scars of deadly Indonesia tsunami - CNA,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/indonesia-tsunami-seventeen-band-ifan-sole-survivor-recovery-12196134,"JAKARTA: It had been raining heavily for hours on Tuesday (Dec 17) in the Indonesian capital city, resulting in minor floods.

“Please accept my apologies for the delay. Ifan is on his way but his car was stuck in the floods so he had to make a U-turn,” the head of the artiste management firm overseeing the singer's schedule said to CNA.

“Ifan had to make a U-turn because he is afraid of the water,” a staff member of the firm said with a laugh.

What may seem like light-hearted banter could actually be real fear for Ifan, 36, who survived a tsunami that killed more than 400 people.

In fact, he is the sole survivor of Indonesian pop rock band Seventeen which was hit by a tsunami when they were performing in Tanjung Lesung, Banten province on Dec 22 last year.

“I still haven’t swum or been near a beach since the tragedy,” Ifan told CNA in an exclusive interview.

Dressed in black, Ifan lit a cigarette before he opened up about his traumatic experience and how he is on the road to recovery.

It was a Saturday night on Dec 22 last year and frontman Ifan and his band members – Bani, Andi and Herman – were performing in Tanjung Lesung Beach Resort for a company’s year-end gathering.

Ifan decided to bring his wife actress Dylan Sahara along.

Tanjung Lesung was a favourite tourist destination, especially for Jakartans, being near to the beach and the enigmatic Anak Krakatau volcano.

It was around 9pm when the band was performing with its back to the sea.

Ifan remembered singing and jumping when a deluge hit the stage. Everything around him collapsed.

“I first thought the event organiser built a lousy stage. I thought ‘somebody will be responsible for building this hideous stage’ but soon I found myself drowning in water,” Ifan, whose real name is Riefian Fajarsyah, recounted.

“'This must be either a dream or doomsday,’ I then thought.”

FIGHTING IN THE WATER FOR TWO HOURS

He saw how everything was submerged in water - men, women, children and all kinds of items such as chairs, tables and shoes.

That was when he realised that he was out at sea.

“I tried to swim to the surface, but it wasn’t easy. I got hit by waves several times. I saw how people were trying to hold on to others who still had the energy to swim. I had people trying to grab me, my feet, my hand,” he recounted.

“Someone scratched my face while trying to hold on to me. I even saw how people died. Some drowned, some just slowly became stiff.”

While fighting to breathe, Ifan came across a black box, which he later found out was part of the band's lighting equipment.

He finally had something he could hold on to.

But he wasn’t alone, there were three other people holding on to it so they had to share the box.

“It was a scary situation and I honestly thought I wouldn’t make it. But I knew I had to remain calm and keep the spirit of all of us alive,” Ifan said.

They kept themselves calm by reciting Islamic supplications and Ifan also tried to motivate them by yelling words of optimism.

“I told them: ‘The shore is still far. We may need a couple of hours but even if we have to do this till tomorrow morning, we will survive. We can do this. Okay?' And they said yes,” Ifan remembered.

He didn’t want to tell the others that the shore was near because he didn’t want to give them false hope.

After roughly two hours, they saw some light from the shore. “It was a flashlight from the shore. We were so happy. We knew it was still far but it motivated us to hold on,” he said.

They finally reached land and were immediately helped by security guards who were standing in the darkness with their flashlights.

Ifan had many questions, but the most crucial one was: Where was his wife?

VIRAL TSUNAMI VIDEOS

The following morning, Indonesia woke up to the news of the devastating tsunami.

It was caused by the eruption and partial collapse of the Anak Krakatau volcano which had been active for the past few months.

A video of the band performing when the tsunami suddenly hit them went viral.

Another video of Ifan in tears while announcing the death of his bassist Bani and road manager Oki Wijaya also garnered a lot of attention.



In the same video, Ifan pleaded for help to find the band’s guitarist Herman, the drummer Andi, band crew Uje and his wife Sahara.



“Do I have regrets? At first yes. I regretted having asked Dylan to accompany me to Tanjung Lesung, I regretted having ignored the guys’ concerns,” Ifan told CNA.

He said his fellow band members noticed how the volcano was sparkling before their performance.

“But I ignored it. I said to them, we are here to work, we’re not going to die.”

The body of guitarist Herman and crew member Uje were found on Dec 23, 2018, while Andi’s the following day.

Also on Dec 24, a day after what was supposed to be her birthday, authorities found Sahara.

The couple were married for two years.

“The first few months were the hardest. I first tried to deal with the fact that Dylan was gone. Once I came to accept that, then I started to deal with the fact that my band members also died,” he revealed.

POLITICAL CAMPAIGNING TOOK HIS MIND OFF TRAGEDY

In the first few weeks, Ifan could not bear the thought of being home alone.

“I would often go out in the middle of the night, and then drive around my house numerous times until I became very tired, usually at around 2am.

Then I would finally park my car in front of my house and just sleep in the car. I couldn’t sleep at home,” Ifan said.

He added: ""I wanted to die too.”

He also didn’t want to meet anyone, not even close friends. “Because every time I meet someone, they will bring up the tsunami. And then I have to tell the story. It was so painful, so I decided it’s best just not to meet anyone.”

He had problems singing again but refused to seek professional help.

Before the disaster, Ifan had been registered as a parliament candidate for the April election.

“In February, I understood that it was my obligation to campaign and meet people. So I had to have a daily routine again,” he said.

He was running in the Indonesian province of West Kalimantan. There are many rivers and boats are a common form of transportation.

“At first, I was very afraid. I didn’t want to be near the water. But I told myself, if this what it takes to be a parliament member, then so be it.

""So I forced myself to get onto the boat but it turned out okay. The campaigning was needed to heal my wounds,” he said.

He also mentioned how he encountered many Islamic clerics during the campaigning and that they gave him soothing advice.

The election results announced in May showed that Ifan did not win but he accepted it.

GETTING ON STAGE AGAIN

In June, Ifan started to have the courage to go on stage again.

He told his manager that he only wanted to perform on a small stage first in front of a small crowd. He would only sing one Seventeen song. As time went on, he played on bigger stages and was able to sing more songs.

He is now performing regularly as a solo singer singing some of Seventeen’s songs and also other artistes' pieces.

“It took me a while, but I finally felt alive again,” he said.

When asked what his plans are, especially for 2020, Ifan replied: “I used to be a planner. I used to have plans but now I just want to take things step by step.""

""This year, 2019, I feel there are only four months. September, October, November and December. Between January and August, I felt numb. It was my recovery process”.

But he is sure that he will stay in the music industry and continue singing.

He also wants to go back to Tanjung Lesung Beach Resort to get proper closure.

The resort’s CEO Poernomo Siswoprasetijo told CNA that the property began receiving guests about a month after the tsunami, starting with researchers.

Tanjung Lesung also obtained a new tsunami Warning Receiver System in September and is now ready to host a New Year’s party.

Before the tsunami last year, it was not widely known that volcanic eruptions can cause tsunamis.

To Ifan, the disaster gave him an important message.

“We sometimes don’t realise how pleasant it is to be surrounded by loved ones. Whether surrounded by friends, a nice boss, a nice subordinate, a sister, a brother, a family, parents, a husband, a wife or a partner.

""It is a blessing from Allah, God, but we just don’t realise it. If we realise it, we will definitely behave better.

""We also don’t realise the blessing of life. Life is so precious,” he said.

While floods are usually seen as an unwanted natural disaster, a village inundated with floodwater in Kampar regency, Riau, has instead become a destination for local tourists who are looking for a place to spend their year-end holiday.

Hundreds of people flocked to a flooded street in Buluh Cina village on Wednesday, with many of them bringing along their children to play in the floodwater.

Some children were seen swimming with pool floats, while others rented wooden motorboats to travel around the inundated village, kompas.com reported.

Farhan, a visitor from Pekanbaru, said he had already taken his children to the village twice this holiday season.

“I took them here to play in the water as well as to visit the fish market since they’re on a school holiday,” he said.

Since the flood currents were strong, Farhan said he always kept an eye on his children.

Rosmiati, another visitor, said she took her daughter to play in Buluh Cina almost every day since her own village was located nearby.

“I’m not really worried about letting her play around here, since I always watch over her,” she said, admitting that the currents were indeed strong due to rising water levels.

Local authorities have warned visitors to be cautious when playing in the floodwater, especially as water levels differ depending on the area, ranging from 50 centimeters to 1 meter in depth.

Security officers were seen standing guard in the area in case of emergency situations, such as drowning or being swept away by the water.

“Please always watch over your children, especially if they cannot swim, as we don’t want any casualties to occur here,” Buluh Cina village head-elect Azrianto advised visitors.

Kampar is one of six regencies in Riau that has been hit hard by floods this month, with the natural disaster affecting hundreds of villages and more than 25,000 households in the province.

The Riau provincial administration declared a state of emergency that will last for 11 days from Dec. 20 to Dec. 31.

When part of the seawall broke earlier this month, it brought back bad memories for Awing Takalar, a fisherman who lives nearby. He thought back to 2007, when another levee burst and washed all his belongings away.

Luckily, waves were not running high at the time of the most recent break. So, Takalar and others living in the area along Jakarta’s northern shoreline were not flooded.

Takalar told the Reuters news agency that he knows he could be less lucky next time. “My worry is that the water is higher than the land,” the 46-year-old Takalar said. He expressed concern for the safety of his teenage daughter when she stays alone at the family’s one-room home in Jakarta’s Muara Baru area.

When the sea broke through the levee 12 years ago, Takalar took his family back to their home on the island of Sulawesi. “When it got better, I returned again,” he said. He added that once his daughter finishes school, he might leave the area for good.

Jarot Widyoko is the director of rivers and coasts at Indonesia’s public works and public housing ministry. He said officials were investigating why a 170-meter stretch of the 2.3-kilometer-long wall broke -- even though it was built only a few years ago.

The incident has brought attention to efforts aimed at protecting parts of the low-lying city from major flooding in the future.

Jakarta has been slowly sinking. Large amounts of ground water have been extracted from under the city. Rising sea levels have made the threat of flooding even worse. The situation has pushed city officials to try to come up with protective measures.

In 2014, the government announced a plan to build a giant seawall along the coast as part of a $40-billion project to protect the city through 2030. The project includes a delayed plan to build a new city on a series of reclaimed islands in Jakarta Bay.

Environmental groups have criticized the plan. They say the developers have not considered the project’s effects on Jakarta Bay and are not addressing the problems related to sinking.

Heri Andreas is an expert on settling and sinking land at Indonesia’s Bandung Institute of Technology. He told Reuters that land in Muara Baru was sinking about 12 centimeters per year, one of the fastest rates in Jakarta.

In August, officials announced a decision to move the national capital from Jakarta to East Kalimantan province on the island of Borneo. One of the main reasons for the decision was to help ease a “heavy burden” related to overcrowding and pollution in Jakarta, the government said.

Jakarta (AsiaNews/Agencies) – Indonesia’s National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) yesterday released a report indicating that 3,622 natural disasters occurred across the country so far this year, about 90 per cent (2,699) caused by hydrometeorological phenomena like tornadoes, floods and landslides.

As a result of the increase in the number of incidents, the authorities have been forced to improve emergency response protocols, since experts predict the trend will continue next year.

The BNPB registered 3,397 disasters in 2018, about 2,500 related to hydrological factors. Despite the greater number of disasters in 2019, the number of victims - 475 dead and 108 missing - is lower than last year when earthquakes, tsunamis and landslides in some parts of the country caused the death of 4,231 people.

Government data show that in 2019 most of the disasters were caused by tornadoes (over 1,280 cases), followed by 734 floods and 685 landslides.

BNPB spokesperson Agus Wibowo said that the situation is unlikely to improve in 2020 due to widespread environmental damage.

Environment and Forestry Ministry data show the country lost about 440,000 hectares of forests between 2017 and 2018. By comparison, the size of Bali Island is around 578,000 hectares.

At the same time, the BNPB noted that devastating fires wiped out over 942,480 hectares of forest in Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) and Sumatra in 2019.

To tackle the matter, the agency held a meeting yesterday with the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG), the National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas), the National Police as well as the Indonesian military at its headquarters in Central Jakarta.

The discussion focused on ways to coordinate and each agency’s disaster mitigation plans in the event of an environmental disaster.

Specifically, the increase in hydrological disasters prompted Basarnas to improve response times. Recently, it successfully revamped its rescue operations management protocol, shortening post-disaster rescue delays from 30 to 26 minutes.

The agency’s rescue teams remain on stand-by 24/7 at 67 search and rescue posts across the country with 4,500 trained volunteers and 3,000 personnel.

The National Police’s Mobile Brigade (Brimob) for its part is also taking steps to deal with a possibly more disastrous rainy season, training 2,500 personnel to be promptly deployed when needed.","Wed, 18 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/INDONESIA_-_1218_-_Disastri.jpg,"['experienced', 'tornadoes', 'rescue', 'caused', 'response', 'country', '3622', 'number', 'improve', 'disasters', 'national', 'natural', 'agency', '2019', 'indonesia']",

Last month, the northern Italian city of canals was hit by the highest tide in more than 50 years, with tourists wading through flooded streets to seek shelter as a fierce wind whipped up waves in St. Mark's Square.

The exceptionally intense ""acqua alta,"" or high waters, peaked at 1.87 meters (six feet) on November 12, according to the tide monitoring center.

""Since mid-November, following a historic flood, we have seen an unprecedented drop (in the number) of bookings. This did not even happen after the attacks on the Twin Towers,"" said Vittorio Bonacini, chief of the Association of Venetian Hoteliers during a press conference.

""We recorded a peak of 45 percent cancellations (in the last 30 days) and had to cancel events, conferences and major initiatives planned for next year,"" he added.

Bonacini said people's understanding of the situation on the ground was far from reality.

""We have received worried calls from the United States, asking us if a child one and a half meters tall (five feet) could visit without being in danger.""

But he said Venice is more than a meter above sea level and that when people speak of a 1.30 meter high tide, the reality is the water level is only 30 centimeters and only in some parts of the old city.

He also said the historic high tide lasted only an hour and a half, before the situation normalized within in a few hours.

According to the association, more than 31 million tourists visited Venice last year -- but 20 million spent only one day there and only 11.5 million stayed in the 274 hotels in the historic center.","Sat, 21 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2019/11/15/2019_11_15_82426_1573790761._large.jpg,"['bookings', 'floodhit', 'high', 'million', 'meters', 'tourism', 'unprecedented', 'hotel', 'situation', 'historic', 'tide', 'venice', 'ebbs', 'tourists', 'association', '45']",

For the longest time, the two main urban woes infamously attached to Indonesia’s capital city Jakarta have been severe traffic congestion and perennial floods, visible and affecting the everyday lives of many Jakartans.

People can see lines of fossil-fueled vehicles clogging the roads and slowing down their mobility. Those living on river banks have to endure the annual floods, which sometimes force them to stay at temporary shelters until the waters recede and afterward work hard to clean the mud in the aftermath of the floods.

The tsunami - triggered by a massive 9.1 magnitude quake - also hit at least six other countries along the rim of the Indian Ocean, killing more than 230,000 people. Indonesia was hit hardest, with more than 168,000 killed.

Fifteen years on, Munandar and tens of thousands of others have been allowed to rebuild in the same low-lying areas of Banda Aceh despite continuing risks of tsunami and other coastal hazards like flooding, Reuters found. Officials and experts say it’s because of lax law enforcement, a lack of government resources for relocation, and an entrenched reluctance on the part of many survivors to abandon their lives and livelihoods near the coast.

More than 25,600 residential, commercial, government and school buildings are inside the high-risk area, which was almost completely wiped out in 2004, according to a Reuters analysis of city data. City officials say about 50,000 people live there today -- nearly the same as in 2004.

Immediately after the disaster, the government considered banning construction within a two-kilometer (1.2 mile) coastal buffer zone. But the plan was dropped after communities, many dependent on fishing, took to the streets to protest such attempts to move them away from their ancestral lands and livelihoods.

Survivors like Munandar, who received around 25 million rupiah ($1,700) each in reconstruction aid, rebuilt in the hazard zone. The government spent 2.2 trillion rupiah rebuilding 25,000 houses throughout the city, including inside the hazard zone, according to officials.

POOR ENFORCEMENT

Srinivasa Tummala, an oceanographer who heads the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System, says governments in Indonesia and the region need to do more to control coastal populations and prepare communities by holding regular tsunami drills, marking out evacuation routes, constructing shelters, and enforcing minimum building standards.

“Realistically, there needs to be both stricter enforcement and building community resilience,” Tummala said.

Jalaluddin, head of the public works and spatial planning department in Banda Aceh, said that since foreign aid had dried up the city government no longer had the funds needed to relocate residents or create seawalls near the coast.

Even where building codes and zoning laws existed, there was little urgency to enforce them now that the 2004 disaster was 15 years in the past, and stronger structures were expensive to build, he said. This meant most buildings did not meet minimum standards to withstand earthquakes or strong waves.

“All we can do is ... build facilities like evacuation buildings and conduct evacuation drills,” Jalaluddin, who goes by one name, told Reuters. “If the public wants to stay on in high-risk zones, we must find engineering solutions to withstand disasters.”

The government had informed people of the risks of living in danger zones by adding disaster preparedness to the school curriculum, through public service announcements, and by enlisting the help of volunteers and religious leaders to conduct tsunami drills.

DISASTER-PRONE

Indonesia, which straddles the seismically active area known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, is one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries, research shows. Since 1900, at least 26 fatal tsunamis have struck Indonesia - 14 of which killed more than 100, according to a database maintained by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Even so, the 2004 tsunami was an event with little regional precedent and caught countries unprepared. Outside Indonesia, about 40,000 people were killed in Sri Lanka, and 5,395 people in Thailand, among them about 2,000 foreign tourists. Both of those countries also have allowed rebuilding.

“These are random phenomena, but it is important to communicate that while they might be infrequent, their impact can be huge. There is so much uncertainty in predicting how large such events can be ... that it is better just to be prepared,” said Finn Lovholt, a tsunami specialist and principal scientist at the Norwegian Geological Institute.

Since 2004, countries like Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand have taken pains to educate people about coastal hazards like tsunami, storm surges, and flooding. Governments have collectively spent millions on a regional early-warning system, evacuation routes, beachfront sirens, and tsunami drills.

But a terrifying reminder of Banda Aceh’s under-preparedness came in 2012, when an 8.6-magnitude quake struck at sea. Thousands of residents shunned shelters and fled by car and motorcycle, clogging streets with traffic, while a network of powerful warning sirens stayed silent because they were broken. No waves came, but the event showed how unprepared the country was for another disastrous tsunami.

For residents like Munandar, there is often little choice but to stay in high-risk areas. He lived in a camp for displaced survivors for six years after the 2004 tsunami and could not afford to relocate.

Those who own houses or land in the danger zone find it difficult to sell to others fearful of the risks, while some are reluctant to abandon their communities or what little they own.

“Everyone has trauma from that time but we can’t be afraid all the time,” Munandar said in the house he rebuilt just 500 meters from the shore. “What we need now is to know how to survive wherever we are because disaster will come without notice.”","Sun, 22 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191223&t=2&i=1467389266&r=LYNXMPEFBM00W&w=800,"['rebuilding', 'city', 'zone', 'aceh', 'indonesias', 'banda', 'little', 'peril', 'munandar', '2004', 'indonesia', 'leaves', 'cant', 'countries', 'afraid', 'tsunami']",

(Photo courtesy of Sale Duck)

Jakarta. The Customs Office has tightened the rules for e-commerce imports on Monday as part of a concerted effort to protect local small businesses producing shoes, bags and clothes.

Heru Pambudi, the director general of customs and excise at the Finance Ministry, said in a statement that any import shipment valued at $3 or more must now pay import tax – a much lower import tax-free threshold than the previous $75. The new rule will be effective starting Jan. 1 next year.

This was the second time in just over a year that the customs office had lowered the consignment value threshold. The customs reduced the limit, also known as the de minimis rule, from $100 to $75 per shipment in October last year to restrict imports.

The rise of e-commerce in Indonesia has allowed importers to exploit a leeway in the country's import regime in the past few years. Instead of buying in bulk and pay import tax as they used to, importers can now simply set up an online shop and let buyers ship in individual items and skip paying taxes entirely.

Heru said the office decided to tighten the loophole to protect local producers, especially small businesses producing bags, shoes and fashion items.

""Many of them had to close up shops as the market was being flooded by products from overseas,"" Heru said.

In addition, the government has also set a 15-20 percent import tax for bags, 25-30 percent for shoes and 15-25 percent for textile products, depending on the countries where the items come from.

Those taxes will be charged on top of a value-added tax of 10 percent and a deductible income tax of 7.5-10 percent, making the total taxes that need to be paid when importing significantly higher, Heru said.

Tighter import rules would create ""a level playing field for local products from Cibaduyut, Cihampelas and Tajur,"" he said, referring to traditional production centers for shoes, bags and fashion clothing in West Java.

Heru said the government at the same time has also lowered the import tax for other products impacted by the lower threshold policy.

Items aside from shoes, bags and clothes are now charged a 7.5 percent import tax, a 10 percent value-added tax and 0 percent deductible income tax. ""So, in general, the total taxes that customers need to pay [when importing] have actually fallen from 27.5-37.5 percent to just 17.5 percent,"" Heru said.

The Finance Ministry will also connect its customized National Single Window (NSW) system with online marketplaces to monitor transaction data, including the quantity, type and price of goods, in real time.

Heru said this will ensure transparency between e-commerce shops and the government.

""The Finance Ministry has already conducted a pilot project for this new system with Lazada, Blibli and Bukalapak,"" he said.","Tue, 24 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.beritasatu.com/cache/jakartaglobe/640x441-4/2016/11/SaleDuck.jpg,"['threshold', 'shoes', 'bags', 'tax', 'reduces', 'life', 'taxes', 'products', 'difficult', 'online', 'customs', 'import', 'makes', '75', 'indonesia', 'shops', 'pay']", 
17,17,FL-2019-000181-IDN,Lao PDR joins early warning system regional capacity development program - PDC Global,https://www.pdc.org/lao-pdr-regional-program-2019/,"Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR) hosted a team from PDC for an initiation and planning meeting as part of a new regional program designed to enhance disaster management capabilities throughout the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region. Lao PDR is one of the ASEAN member states that is working with the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) and the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Centre) to broaden regional collaboration and use of PDC’s DisasterAWARE hazard monitoring and early warning platform.

“Lao PDR faces many hazards including floods, droughts, landslide, storms, climate risks , and more,” said Director General Vilayphong Sisomvang in his opening remarks during the meeting in Vientiane, Lao PDR. Mr. Vilayphong is the Director General of the Department of Social Welfare and serves as the Head of Secretary of Central Disaster Management Committee of Lao PDR and known as NDMO. “We must continue to combat these hazards by utilizing available technologies and expertise through our partners in the region.”

The program is funded by the USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and aims to make use of the latest data, science, and technology among ASEAN member states. “ASEAN is home to one of the most vulnerable populations in the world, exposed to some of the most extreme hazards and disaster risks,” said USAID Deputy Country Office Director Patrick Bowers. “This program extends the successful model of partnership between PDC and the AHA Centre to Lao PDR— advancing our mutual objectives to save lives and strengthen collaboration between nations.”

The three-day meeting included delivery of training by PDC on the use of the AHA Centre’s robust Disaster Monitoring and Response System (DMRS)—a version of PDC’s DisasterAWARE platform customized specifically to support the ASEAN region. Participants represented organizations from across sectors, including the ministries of social welfare, defense, natural resources, the National Disaster Prevention and Control Committee, and several others. The training focused on use of the system for early warning alerts, disaster impact assessment, planning, and preparedness.

“We are excited to begin the process of helping our Lao PDR disaster management colleagues leverage the wealth of analytics and global and regional information within DMRS—to be supplemented by Lao PDR national data—to make more informed decisions that save lives and reduce impacts to Lao PDR’s development. We are grateful to USAID for their tremendous support towards this goal,” said PDC Deputy Executive Director Chris Chiesa. “It is exciting to see our long-held discussions and work to expand capacity with Lao PDR coming to fruition under this program.”

The meeting explored existing decision-making processes and information flow between Lao PDR agencies and crafted a high-level concept of operations (CONOPS) for the use of DMRS to support disaster operations. Discussions also explored availability of authoritative data and information from Lao PDR agencies and how they could most readily be incorporated into DMRS.

The collaboration between PDC, the AHA Centre, and Lao PDR’s NDMO on disaster risk reduction and disaster response is not a first. In September this year, PDC and the AHA Centre developed a joint estimated flood impact analysis for Lao PDR to help the nation estimate population exposure, humanitarian needs, and potential building and infrastructure exposure during widespread flooding which hit the country. In 2018, PDC also produced flood maps to aid Lao PDR with response to the Xepian-Xe Nam Noy dam failure in Attapeu. The maps provided first responders and disaster managers with the geographic areas of flood impacts and where vulnerable populations were located.

Lao PDR’s use of DMRS will follow a model successfully used with their fellow ASEAN member Myanmar under a recently concluded project. It is hoped this model can be used with other ASEAN member states as well under this program. Under this regional program, PDC will also provide technical assistance to other AMS to develop and expand their own existing customized versions of DisasterAWARE.

The bus carrying dozens of passengers careered into a 150-metre ravine in South Sumatra province just before midnight on Monday and ended up in a river, local police spokesman Dolly Gumara said.

“It crashed into the concrete road barrier before plunging into the ravine. Some people are still trapped inside the bus,” Gumara said, adding no other vehicle was involved.

Search and rescue teams have been deployed to look for victims, Gumara said, adding injured survivors were taken to hospital.

The accident happened in a remote and steep area near the town of Pagar Alam, hampering the efforts to rescue the victims.

The regional bus left Bengkulu province for Pagar Alam with only 27 passengers but some survivors told police there were around 50 people on board when the accident happened.

“Some passengers were probably added along the way so there’s a possibility some more people are still missing in the river,” Gumara said.

19,19,FL-2019-000181-IDN,Flood of Chinese onions shows Nepal's push to ease India reliance - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/Flood-of-Chinese-onions-shows-Nepal-s-push-to-ease-India-reliance,"KATHMANDU -- Landlocked Nepal has long been dependent on its giant southern neighbor India for much of its trade with the outside world. But it has begun looking northward to China for essential imports, including a key ingredient in Nepalese cuisine: onions.

The humble onion is a symbol of the region's fraught geopolitics. The government of Prime Minister K.P. Oli, head of the Nepal Communist Party, is trying to diversify the country's trade. Nepal has signed a number of trade treaties and other agreements with China in such areas as hydropower, cement production, railway development and airport construction. But its deepening ties with China make India anxious. New Delhi has reacted by putting pressure on its smaller neighbor in order to maintain its dominance in South Asia.

In September, India placed restrictions onion exports as it grappled with a shortage caused by widespread flooding. That forced Nepalese traders to look to China to make up the shortfall. Nepal relies on India for more than 60% of its total imports. In the case of onions, the figure has been 80% to 90%.

But since mid-Novemmber Chinese onions have flooded in, mostly through the border town of Tatopani, northeast of the capital, and Rasuwa, a district to the north. ""Around eight to 10 vehicles are entering Nepal every day, carrying [a total of] 100 tons worth of Chinese onions... due to the shortage. The onions cost 40-60 cents per kilogram, which amounts to 45 to 68 Nepalese rupees per kilogram. And all of them go directly to Kathmandu,"" said Keshav Raj Oli, a customs officer at Tatopani.

""The number of vehicles entering Nepal is not constant every day, but around 100 vehicles entered yesterday, and 30 today. The vehicles usually travel from 3,500 km away... and the journey is arduous as there's a blockage sometimes, due to dreadful weather,"" he added.

Because the Himalayan country cannot meet its own needs solely with local production, traders rely on imports. According to official figures, Nepal produced 239,000 tons of onions from around 20,000 hectares, while 310,000 tons were imported, mostly from India. But since October, nearly all imports from India have ceased.

The ban on Indian onion exports comes as no surprise to Nepalese consumers, who have fresh memories of a previous Indian blockade in 2015. As Nepal struggled to recover from a deadly earthquake in April that year, India halted a number of key exports, including onions, other food items and petroleum products. Kathmandu restaurants had to serve dishes with few vegetables, sardonically called the ""Modi menu"" -- a reference to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Oli who was previously prime minister in 2015 to 2016, vowed to ease the country's dependence on India by doing more business with China.

India also bans the export of onion seeds to Nepal, forcing it to depend on imports. The Nepalese government responded in 2008 with a five-year plan titled ""Mission Onion"" aimed at making the country self-sufficient. The goal was to increase production by 271,634 tons by expanding cultivation in 10 southern districts of the country. But Mission Onion was a dismal failure, raising output by just 22,593 tons grown on an additional 2,149 hectares. The effort was stymied by a lack of cold storage and ineffective policy implementation.

That has left imports to fill the gap. ""After India imposed the ban... the only immediate plan right now is to import from China and satisfy customers' needs,"" said Posta Raj Bastola, an officer at the Rasuwa customs office. ""Even garlic is imported from China,"" he said.

Chinese onions are cheaper than Indian ones, but Nepalese consumers are not used to the taste. Nevertheless, tight supplies have sent the price of Chinese onions skyrocketing, too. When onions from China began arriving at Nepal's wholesale markets in mid-November, they went for 100 rupees per kilogram, but the price soon jumped to 160 rupees; Indian imports cost around 200 rupees per kilogram.","Wed, 18 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F2%252F6%252F5%252F5%252F24415562-3-eng-GB%252FCropped-1579059608RTR38WSE.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['vehicles', 'india', 'nepals', 'nepal', 'onions', 'reliance', 'flood', 'ease', 'imports', 'push', 'chinese', 'onion', 'shows', 'tons', 'indian', 'nepalese', 'china']",

JAKARTA: Scientists, politicians and the people of Iceland recently placed a plaque mourning the loss of Okjokull glacier.

Okjokull is no longer a living glacier because there has been insufficient ice build-up over the years to expand its glacial mass.

The plaque acknowledges what is happening and what needs to be done in the next 200 years, because all of Iceland’s main glaciers are expected to suffer the same fate.



INDONESIA’S GLACIERS

Indonesia has glaciers on the Jayawijaya Mountains in Papua.

The ice-covered peaks have lost 84.9 per cent of their glacial surface since 1988. A study has predicted the remaining glacial area will disappear within ten years.

More alarming for Indonesia, climate change threatens not only its glaciers but also its vast seas, which make up around 70 per cent of the country’s area and are much deeper than the height of Jayawijaya Mountains.

A panel of climate scientists under the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently released the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC). The report explains the latest understanding of our changing oceans and cryosphere (the cryosphere refers to the components of the Earth that are frozen).

How are the SROCC’s findings relevant to Indonesia?

CHANGING OCEANS

Scientific findings have revealed the melting of the cryosphere that leads to global sea-level rise is just one of climate change’s many domino effects.

The report underlines that climate change causes the oceans to become warmer and more acidic and to lose oxygen persistently. Sea level rise that may submerge small islands happens not only continuously but is also accelerating.

Extreme climate phenomena such as marine heatwaves are becoming more frequent, intense and long-lasting, particularly in the tropics.

The same is true of extreme El Nino–Southern Oscillation events, which cause droughts and floods in Indonesia.

THE STRAIN ON MARINE ECOSYSTEMS

SROCC contains several important warnings about climate change’s impact on Indonesia as a tropical, archipelagic country.

First, marine biodiversity is at risk. Climate change causes shifts in seasonal rhythms and the geographical ranges of marine species.



Since the 1950s, marine species living in the upper 200m of the sea have been shifting poleward at about 52 km per decade. A similar pattern is happening to seafloor ecosystems.



Considering the high biodiversity of marine species in Indonesia, further research is needed on changes in seasonal rhythms and geographical distributions of marine species in Indonesia.

Second, the report highlights coral reefs as the most sensitive key marine ecosystem compared to seagrass and mangrove ecosystems that are also prevalent in Indonesia.

As host to the largest seagrass ecosystems in Southeast Asia and 23 per cent of total mangrove forests in the world, this finding is important for Indonesia. Reduced seagrass and mangrove ecosystems may lower the capacity of coastal ecosystems to absorb carbon emissions.

Third, ocean warming reduces Indonesia’s maximum sea catch potential by up to 30 per cent if greenhouse gas emissions keep rising throughout the 21st century. This adds to the burden on a fisheries sector already plagued by overfishing.

Combined effects of warmer and more acidic waters also have negative consequences for fish stocks and calcareous marine organisms (such as pearl oysters and lobsters).

DON’T BLAME EVERYTHING ON CLIMATE CHANGE

To formulate effective adaptation strategies, we need to understand the interactions of environmental degradation that occurs not only because of climate change.

A classic example is the problem of the rising sea level in Jakarta – it is primarily driven by land subsidence due to groundwater extraction.

The UN report also makes a distinction between ocean and coastal acidification.

Ocean acidification refers to the increase of hydrogen ions in ocean waters due to reaction between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and seawaters. However, Indonesian seas also experience coastal acidification due to local activities such as waste and pollution that further acidify seawater.

Local solutions that could regulate the ambient seawater acidity may reduce the impact of ocean and coastal acidification on the local community. These include effective waste management and conservation of seagrass ecosystems.

SROCC AND CLIMATE NEGOTIATION

SROCC is an important scientific input for climate negotiation at the United Nationals Climate Change Conference (COP25) in Spain.

As a maritime nation, Indonesia plays an important role in taking concrete and realistic actions on climate change.

SROCC shows the benefits of employing ambitious and effective climate adaptation strategies, such as protecting coastal communities, particularly those with large populations, from rising sea level. This protection is in line with sustainable development.

SROCC states that the ocean is largely a victim of climate change, while land is identified as the primary culprit as well as victim of climate change.

Warmer, more acidic and deoxygenated oceans have implications for Indonesia’s commitments to protect its biodiversity and achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Climate change challenges our commitment to protect marine biodiversity, the capacity of coastal ecosystems to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and the sustainable use of marine resources.

Scientific findings from the SROCC and other UN publications should create momentum to take action that is inclusive and beyond business as usual. Such efforts will be appreciated by future generations.

Phanfone has since made several landfalls in the Visayas group of islands, bringing heavy rains, strong winds, and flash floods to provinces in the region.

Thousands have evacuated their homes and thousands more are stranded in ports around the country, officials said.

One person died due to electrocution, Leyte province governor Dominic Petilla told radio DZMM on Wednesday.

Phanfone has maximum sustained winds of up to 140 kph (86.992 mph) near the centre and gustiness of up to 195 kph (121.167 mph), according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration.

Slideshow ( 3 images )

That timeline is a year earlier than the government’s original estimate and Widodo said he had also ordered the construction of basic infrastructure to begin next year.

The president announced in August the government intended to move the administrative capital to East Kalimantan province, on Borneo, by 2024 to relieve the heavy burden on the current capital Jakarta due to overcrowding and pollution.

He visited the site of the new city for two days from Tuesday, observing from a helicopter the spot where a new state palace was due to be built, according to government statements.

In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Widodo said the government would form a new agency to oversee the relocation project next month and it would then officially submit a bill backing the move to parliament.

“The whole process, including the grand design, I hope can be completed in six months. Then, we can do some land clearing and basic infrastructure construction,” he wrote on the posting, next to a photograph of himself standing on some barren, scrubby land atop a hill.

While some Indonesians have been excited by the plans to move the capital, some green groups have criticized the project for its potential environmental impact and others have questioned how Indonesia will raise the funds to build it.

Some non-governmental organizations have also said that a number of national and local politicians with land interests in the area could stand to benefit from the megaproject.

The 256,000 hectare site of the capital is on highland overseeing a bay, Widodo said, noting government offices would begin to be built next year and should be ready by 2023.

On Tuesday, Widodo expressed hope that the new capital could be the “next Silicon Valley” due to a cluster of research and innovation facilities envisaged for the area.

He also inaugurated the first toll road in the Kalimantan area.

Jakarta, the current capital of the world’s fourth most populous country, on the island of Java, is now home to 10 million people and is sinking due to over-extraction of ground water, as well as being prone to floods and traffic gridlock.","Wed, 18 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191218&t=2&i=1465634516&r=LYNXMPEFBH14S&w=800,"['ready', 'city', 'president', 'valleylike', 'seeks', 'capital', 'site', 'widodo', 'jakarta', 'silicon', 'project', 'speed', 'indonesia', 'land']",

Thousands of people in typhoon-prone central Philippines have had their Christmas plans ruined after they were told to leave their homes as a severe tropical storm approaches.

Officials on Christmas Eve said residents should evacuate coastal areas, and thousands more were stranded at ports with ferry services shut down as the nation hunkered down for rain and strong winds.

Damaging gale- to storm-force winds were forecast over the Asian nation's Pacific coast in the afternoon ahead of Tropical Storm Phanfone's projected landfall on Samar island as early as 5:00 pm (0900 GMT), the state weather service said.

Though much weaker, Phanfone was tracking a similar path as Super Typhoon Haiyan, the country's deadliest cyclone on record which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.

All ships on the storm's projected path through the central islands were ordered to stay in port, while local executives there told residents of the coasts as well as flood- and landslide-prone areas to move to safety.

""Some families are reluctant to evacuate because they want to celebrate Christmas at home, but local officials will force them out if they refuse to heed our warnings,"" regional civil defence official Reyden Cabrigas told AFP.

Cabrigas, speaking by phone from the central city of Tacloban, said evacuations were underway there as well as nearby Samar, but added he did not immediately have a total count.

""We are aiming for zero casualties,"" Cabrigas added.

More than 21,000 ferry passengers trying to get home for the mainly Catholic nation's Christmas holidays have been stranded at ports as shipping shut down, the coast guard said Tuesday.

Local carriers also suspended dozens of domestic flights.

The state weather service said Phanfone, Laotian for ""animal"", may strengthen into a typhoon with sustained peak winds of more than 120 kilometres (62 miles) an hour overnight Wednesday.

It advised residents, including those in Manila, to stay indoors on Christmas Day to avoid the high winds which can cause damage to weaker structures.

The Philippines is the first major landmass facing the Pacific cyclone belt, and the archipelago gets hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year, putting millions of people in disaster-prone areas in a state of constant poverty.

Strong winds and associated dangers like floods, landslides, and, more rarely, giant walls of seawater pounding the coasts kill scores of people each year, wipe out farmers' harvests and destroy infrastructure.

Homes built with flimsy materials, as well as populated areas along the coasts, floodplains, and mountainous interiors, are often the most vulnerable.","Tue, 24 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2019/12/24/2019_12_24_83950_1577169469._large.jpg,"['areas', 'philippines', 'central', 'storm', 'state', 'christmas', 'coasts', 'tropical', 'ruins', 'residents', 'filipinos', 'winds', 'told', 'weather', 'thousands']",

Three university students found dead, five discovered in flooded Indonesian cave

Three university students were found dead in a cave in Indonesia after they were trapped inside by floodwaters, officials said on Monday.

A search and rescue operation launched on Sunday retrieved five people alive from Lele cave in West Java after heavy rain hit the area and flooded it, authorities said.

The victims “were trapped inside the cave for quite a while before the team managed to evacuate them,” said local search and rescue agency spokeswoman Seni Wulandari.

She said it took an hour for the rescue team to make it into the cave, which is 30 metres below ground level.

The students – part of a university nature club – went there to train in basic caving. A senior member of the club who helped with the evacuation, Ari Alfian, said the weather was normal when the students entered the cave, but an unexpected heavy downpour hit the area.

“Water entered the cave like a waterfall. Initially, only five students were inside the cave, including the victims,” Alfian said on Monday.

“Another three came in to rescue them as the bad weather arrived. They were all trapped but only five managed to survive.”

ADDIS ABABA, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- Clime change-induced impacts have greatly affected Ethiopia as the East African country in recent years witnessed flooding, drought and food insecurity, an official at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Office in Ethiopia has said.

""Climate change impacts have greatly affected Ethiopia in terms of flooding, drought and food insecurity,"" a UNEP statement quoted Margaret Oduk, Program Coordinator at UNEP's Liaison Office to the African Union Commission (AUC), the UN Economic Commission for Africa, and Ethiopia as saying on Friday.

According to Oduk, clime change-induced impacts have affected both Ethiopian lowland and highland areas, in which Ethiopian lowland areas are experiencing increased temperatures and prolonged droughts affecting livestock rearing, while highland areas are also experiencing more intense and irregular rainfall, which together with high temperatures resulted for decreased agricultural production.

""In 2017 alone, the country lost over 2 million animals due to drought,"" Oduk said, as she emphasized that environmental degradation has contributed to reduced land cover and protection against soil erosion, which in turn is further reducing forest cover, which was exacerbated by increased human use of land, unsustainable agricultural practices, indiscriminate grazing of animals and the collection of firewood for household energy.

The East African country, aware of the impacts of clime change, has recently embarked on an ambitious tree-planting initiative, which was part of the Ethiopian government's aspiration to plant 4 billion trees through a project dubbed ""Green Legacy.""","Sat, 28 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",,"['flooding', 'areas', 'oduk', 'insecurity', 'country', 'ethiopia', 'african', 'drought', 'change', 'greatly', 'xinhua', 'climate', 'impacts', 'clime', 'affected', 'food', 'ethiopian', 'official']",

DAR ES SALAAM, Dec. 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's weather watchdog on Friday warned of impending heavy rains to hit 13 regions in four consecutive days beginning Saturday.

The Tanzania Meteorological Authority (TMA) said in its latest weather forecast that the torrential rains will be experienced in Dar es Salaam, Coast, Morogoro, Singida, Dodoma, Lindi, Mtwara, Rukwa, Mbeya, Songwe, Iringa, Njombe and Ruvuma regions, and the Zanzibar archipelago.

TMA said the rains were expected to cause destruction on the infrastructure and property.

""Some businesses and social services in these regions might be brought to a standstill and houses might be submerged by flash floods,"" said the weather forecaster.

The heavy rains on Tuesday brought businesses and transport to a standstill in Tanzania's commercial capital Dar es Salaam as the country's meteorological agency said torrential rains were expected.

Most businesses remained closed throughout the day as transport to the commercial capital city center was suspended after most of the roads were submerged by flash floods.

The Tanzania Fire and Rescue Force also issued a statement asking people residing in Dar es Salaam's valley areas to vacate the areas to avoid being swept away by flash floods.

In May, uninterrupted rainfall also caused serious flooding in Dar es Salaam, resulting in the displacement of over 1,000 households and the destruction of more than 1,500 dwellings and infrastructure.","Sat, 21 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",,"['transport', 'tanzanias', 'salaam', 'heavy', '13', 'regions', 'rains', 'es', 'businesses', 'warns', 'xinhua', 'agency', 'weather', 'flash', 'dar']",

When the skies finally opened, nature was unmerciful.

Unrelenting downpours in October turned to flash floods, destroying her meager home and few remaining possessions, and washing away whatever harvest and bony animals farmers managed to save during the months without rain.

“I have nothing now,” 67-year-old Ali told AFP in a squalid camp on the outskirts of Beledweyne in central Somalia.

Here, 180,000 people fled the fast-rising waters in the country’s worst floods in memory.

The arid Horn of Africa country has always been hostage to climate extremes. Rain is erratic, and drought a feature of life.

But catastrophic weather events are occurring in Somalia with ever-greater fury and frequency, trapping millions in a near-constant cycle of crisis.

Little by little, the ability to recover is ground down, say experts.

There is no time to rebuild homes and replenish food stocks before another disaster strikes.

Impoverished and weakened by decades of war, battling an armed insurgency, Somalia is ill-equipped to cope with the destabilizing impact of double-tap environmental crises.

Aid budgets are stretched trying to respond to back-to-back emergencies.

In May, the United Nations launched a drought appeal, warning of looming starvation as Somalia faced its worst harvest on record.

Six months later, it’s again appealing for help — this time for $72.5 million (65.1 million euros) for half a million victims of flood.

“There hasn’t been a day this year where we haven’t been talking about either drought or floods,” Abigail Hartley, deputy head of office for the U.N. humanitarian agency OCHA in Somalia, told AFP.

A New Norm

Among those fleeing the inundation in Beledweyne, the epicenter of this disaster, were Somalis already on the run from other climate-stricken parts of the region.

“The drought forced us to flee … now we are displaced by floods,” bemoaned Maryama Osman Abdi, who abandoned her bone-dry farmland for a new start in Beledweyne.

Now, her home in ruins, she contemplates her next move.

Many had migrated to the banks of the Shabelle River – a lifeline which runs through Beledweyne – seeking water to revive their livestock, and nurture their crops.

But the river burst its banks under the ceaseless barrage of rain.

The mighty flood that followed should in statistical terms occur only once in 50 years, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). But, the U.N. agency noted, the river overflowed in 2019, after 2018 and 2015.

“This was different from the others. I have never seen anything like it,” Omar Dule, a 74-year-old who has spent his lifetime in Beledweyne, told AFP.

The FAO, bracing for the next overflow, is repairing embankments along the river long neglected by cash-strapped authorities.

Rainfall extremes in Somalia are forecast to intensify this century, even as the region overall dries considerably, said Linda Ogallo, from the Nairobi-based Intergovernmental Authority on Development Climate Prediction and Applications Centre.

“Droughts and floods are increasing, in frequency and intensity,” said Ogallo, a climate scientist who specializes in Somalia’s weather patterns.

It is an omen already playing out for Mohamed Osman Hashi, whose watermelon and sesame fields in Beledweyne have been devastated again and again.

“In recent times, it seems to be on repeat, almost every year,” he told AFP.

Breaking Point

East Africa has endured unusually extreme rainfall since October, with torrential deluges killing hundreds across eight countries, and displacing millions more.

This month, even as water slowly receded in Beledweyne, a tropical cyclone transformed deserts in Somalia’s north into seas. Bosaso, in the semi-autonomous Puntland region, received close to a year’s worth of rain in less than two days.

Adding to the suffering, the FAO said Wednesday that the country had been hit by its worst outbreak of desert locusts in 25 years.

The curse – exacerbated by the exceptional rain – could spread to Somalia’s main crop-growing areas.

The just-concluded U.N. climate summit in Madrid failed to agree on compensation for poor countries, which have least to blame for causing global warming, for weather-related disasters.

This is grim news for Somalia, which lacks the resources to cope with, or plan for, an ever-more hostile climate.

Each blow sets back the monumental task of rebuilding a country reliant on foreign aid to support some 5.4 million people in desperate need.

To compound problems, an October study by international researchers found climate change amplifies conflict, emboldening the Al-Shabaab militants waging a potent insurgency in Somalia.

“Developed countries are more resilient. Somalia has been in crisis for years,” said Chris Print, a hydrologist with the FAO and expert on Somalia’s land and rivers.

“Ironically, the poorest countries are the most likely to be impacted by climate crisis.”

Two months after the floods began, about 220,000 people are yet to receive assistance, the U.N. said.

In the fetid camps for disaster evacuees fringing Beledweyne, 100,0000 people are still unable to return home, squatting beneath tattered stick-and-cloth shelters.

“If it happens again, you can bet that some people are just going to give up,” Print told AFP.

Driven from place to place, pursued by a ferocious climate, some have already reached the end of the road.

“We don’t know what else to do,” said Abdi, squatting in the dirt, surrounded by nine grandchildren.

Authorities preemptively evacuated some 600 people from the area of Landes, where the Gaves de Pau and Oloron rivers meet.

""We are getting used to this now,"" a local pensioner who gave his name as Christian told AFP news agency. ""We put everything on the upper levels, and we clear out everything from the garage.""

Dangerous wind speeds

Utility company Enedis said that 25,000 homes were still without power on Saturday evening, adding that 2,000 technicians were deployed to deal with the problem.

Wind speeds reached 142 kilometers (88 miles) per hour on the mainland on Friday. Even higher wind speeds of 175 kilometers per hour were measured on the island of Corsica.

By Sunday, however, weather service Meteo France downgraded the alert level in most of the affected areas from the highest of red to orange.

The latest storms come less than three weeks after several people lost their lives due to extreme weather in Italy and France.

In particular, the prices of choy sum and bok choy from Johor Baru and Cameron Highlands have shot up by 80 per cent, say wholesalers.

Mr Jerry Tan, vice-president of the Singapore Fruits and Vegetables Importers and Exporters Association, said heavy rain has affected the supply and quality of vegetables from across the Causeway.

Malaysia's annual monsoon season continues unabated and Johor is facing the brunt of it, with some areas struggling with flood waters up to 2.5m deep.

As of Tuesday afternoon, the number of people evacuated in Johor state had more than doubled to 9,348, from 3,934 on Sunday.

Over two-thirds of the state's victims are from Kluang, Segamat and Kota Tinggi, the three most severely hit areas.

Vendors said that wet markets are more likely than supermarkets to be affected by the rain as they rely on a single or limited pool of supplies.

Mr Wong Kok Fah, who runs a family business at Kok Fah Technology Farm near Choa Chu Kang, said price fluctuations due to bad weather happen every year, but this year's has been particularly bad.

He said prices of some vegetables from Malaysia started to double about two weeks ago.

Prices of vegetables from other countries, though, such as China and Indonesia, have been stable. This includes tomatoes from Thailand and cabbage from Indonesia.

Mr Tan pointed out that other market factors affect prices. ""It also depends on what farmers want to grow. Some crops take a month to grow, others two to three months. When farmers don't make money, they may switch to other produce and this will have an impact on supply,"" he said.

He noted that the price of Malaysian iceberg lettuce has gone up 30 per cent, and wholesalers have started to import this from Taiwan as well.

A vendor in Bishan said that the heavy rain in Malaysia has affected the quality of vegetables he gets.

""You pay more for lousy vegetables. There is no choice,"" he said.

Civil servant Felicity Lim, 50, lamented the high prices.

By Talya Meyers

DECEMBER 23, 2019 4:17 AM

A Bahamian baby born upstairs as floodwaters filled the floor below. Another in India, born after a monsoon storm, attached to a placenta for hours after – there was simply no one to cut the cord. Another in Bali, delivered on the roof of a local mosque hours after the floods swept her siblings away.

All around the world, after every calamity, the stories emerge. “After any disaster, there are going to be a few anecdotes about babies born in the parking lot or in the evacuation line,” said Emily Harville, a professor of epidemiology at Tulane University who studies the impacts of disaster on pregnant and postpartum women.

But dramatic birth stories are only the beginning. Both research and on-the-ground experience show that disasters can have a profound effect on pregnant women and their children – even months after the floodwaters recede or the tremors subside.

However, they’re often not top of mind when preparing for a storm – if they’re on people’s minds at all. “OB patients do tend to get ignored” when it comes to disaster planning, said Kay Daniels, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford University.

Caring for pregnant or laboring women during a disaster is complicated, Daniels explained, and she’s even heard of instances where it wasn’t taken into account at all.

In addition, pregnant women are simply more vulnerable than the average person to the conditions during and after a storm, according to Harville. “Pregnant women have a different physiology,” she said.

That physiology may make them more vulnerable both to physical trauma – i.e. injuries – during the disaster itself, Harville said.

But it’s in the days and weeks after a disaster when things begin to get even more complicated. That’s when affected communities are at significantly increased risk of disease outbreak, when high-quality food – or sometimes any food at all – can be difficult to come by. When the stress of displacement, uncertainty, and grief can affect even the most robust survivor.

Pregnant women’s immune systems make them more vulnerable to diseases. Their nutritional needs are greater. And research increasingly shows that the stress of a disaster can cause long-lasting damage.

Yoko Nomura, a professor of behavioral neurosciences at Queens College, CUNY, is studying the children of women who were pregnant during Superstorm Sandy. The results are beginning to emerge, and Nomura says they’re “mind-boggling.”

“Children born from [these] mothers have a different cognitive, neurobehavioral, psychosocial, and physiological profile,” she explained. “They are more reactive, they are more anxious, they are more fearful…they are more likely to be aggressive.”

For Nomura, there’s good reason for a mother in a stressful environment to produce a higher-stress child.

“The mother’s body is trying to prepare the child to become more alert and more reactive…so they’ll be able to deal with the environment more appropriately,” she said. “Even if women are able to handle the stress, body and mind are two different things sometimes.”

Economic and social circumstances can play a major role in how much disaster will affect a pregnant woman – and thus, her baby. “When you have women who have fewer resources, physically or emotionally, that gets harder,” Harville said.

For example, Harville explained, a woman whose house was insured, who was able to find safe shelter and stay employed may experience relatively little disruption. “Maybe you miss a couple of prenatal visits,” she said.

The impact on a woman “rescued from a rooftop, sitting in a shelter, [going] three days without any food” may be more profound.

Robin Lim is an internationally celebrated midwife and activist who runs a nonprofit providing maternal and family health services in Indonesia. She said that the poor women she treats – many of whom live in disaster-prone areas – are particularly vulnerable.

“When [women] are suddenly homeless and they don’t have enough potable water…or any food, we begin to see all kinds of complications,” she said.

Those complications include stillbirths, premature infants, low birth weights, hemorrhage, and retained placentas, which can be deadly for the mother.

According to Lim, these effects are due to a combination of poor conditions and extraordinary stress.

And she often sees them even months after conditions have improved. “Weeks and months go by, and [we see] babies that are too small because of malnourished moms,” she recalled. “Things are getting better, but the babies are getting smaller and smaller.”

Complications may also arise in poor communities after a disaster because “the traditional birth attendants have also been killed,” Lim said. She recalled that, after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, only about 30 midwives remained in the province of Aceh out of more than 150.

Nomura thinks that, thanks to climate change, we’ll see more and more effects on pregnant women and their children. For one thing, major disasters are going to become more common.

But in addition, “climate change brings a lot of additional environmental stressors – hot summers, etc.”

In other words, mothers’ bodies will be preparing children for a much more stressful world.","Tue, 24 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/earthquake.png,"['babies', 'particularly', 'children', 'vulnerable', 'world', 'harville', 'disasters', 'theyre', 'food', 'born', 'woman', 'disaster', 'women', 'pregnant']",

Despite all the machinations of mankind, these 7 cities are sinking.

From shifting tectonic plates to prehistoric legacies, these cities could be ""swimming with the fishes"" by the end of the century if solutions can't be found.

RELATED: TOP 9 MOST HIGH-TECH CITIES IN THE WORLD

What city is sinking the fastest?

According to a study called ""Sinking Cities"" by Dr. Katherine Kramer, the world's fastest sinking city is Jakarta in Indonesia. To date, 40% of the city has already succumbed to rising waters.

As it turns out, the city is sinking at an incredible 25 cm a year!

Jakarta lacks a reliable network of piped-in water, causing many the city's inhabitants building and using private, unregulated, water wells.

According to The New York Times, this causes underground aquifers to become drained, “like deflating a giant cushion underneath the city.”

This has led to a double-edged sword of issues for the city. Heavy rains regularly flood the city's neighborhoods and its heavy development (especially abundance of skyscrapers) are compromising the city's weak, and groundwater drained foundations.

What European cities are sinking?

Believe it or not, various European cities are currently sinking. This might sound crazy, but it is indeed true.

Some of the most notable European cities that are experiencing large-scale subsidence include, but are not limited to:

Venice, Italy (of course)

Rotterdam, The Netherlands

London, The United Kingdom (more or this later)

Is New York City sinking?

It most certainly is. According to a study reported in Scientific American, New York could, by 2100, have sunk around 5 feet (12.7 m).

Its problems are very similar to those of other sinking cities like London.

""Since North American glaciers began retreating 20,000 years ago, the crust from New York City to North Carolina has been sinking, as the larger continent continues to adjust to the unloading."" - Scientific American.

New York's woes are also not helped by its insatiable groundwater extraction and proximity to two large rivers that have a tendency to flood.

What cities are sinking?

So, without further ado, here are 7 of the world's most notable sinking cities. This list is far from exhaustive, we are sad to say.

It is also in no particular order.

1. Shanghai, China

Shanghai is, believe it or not, one of the world's fastest sinking cities. According to sources like EcoWatch, the city is sinking at a rate of around 1 cm per year.

The main cause of the subsidence is groundwater extraction.

Advertisement

This is dramatically down from only a few decades when rate whereas high as 9 cm a year. This dramatic improvement was achieved by local officials requiring official permits for any water wells from 1995.

The city is also losing sediment that would naturally protect it as its rivers are dammed and sediment is used as a construction material.

2. Mexico City, Mexico

Mexico City is one of the world's sinking cities. Groundwater extraction is, according to EcoWatch, causing the city's water table to drop at around 38 cm a year in places.

Over the last 60 years, the city has actually subsided around 9.8 meters or so.

As water is extracted from under the city it leaves empty spaces where the water once was. Over time this is compressed by the weight above, resulting in subsidence.

Another contributing factor is the fact that the city was once built on a drained lake within an old volcanic crater.

3. Bangkok, Thailand

Bangkok is yet another of the world's sinking cities. In fact, the city could be in serious danger of becoming irreparably sunk within the next decade or so.

It is currently sinking at around 2 cm a year.

A 2015 government report predicted the city will likely be underwater by around 2030. The main culprit, like other cities on this list, is groundwater extraction.

Action has been taken to attempt to mitigate this problem such as the 1977 Ground Water Act that has attempted to restrict the practice. Groundwater extraction rates have been reduced and water is also being pumped back underground.

But these measures might not be enough to save the city in the long run.

4. Venice, Italy

Probably the most famous example of sinking cities is Venice in Italy. The city is sinking at around 1 to 2 mm a year.

Best known for its extensive waterways and romantic history, the city is built in a muddy lagoon with inadequate foundations.

This is causing the ground beneath the city to compact over time. Combined with gradual sea level rises over time, the city is slowly being reclaimed by nature.

It has a relatively low population when compared to other cities, which means groundwater extraction is less of a problem for the city but isn't helping matters.

5. Lagos, Nigeria

Lagos in Nigeria is another city sinking under its own weight. The city was built on the coast and incorporates a series of islands.

The city suffers from poor drainage and is under constant threat of flooding. One 2012 study showed that just a sea-level rise of 1 to 3 meters would be catastrophic for the region.

Advertisement

Its large population also consumes huge amounts of groundwater every year leading to series subsidence over time.

6. London, The United Kingdom

The famous and iconic British capital of London is another of the world's sinking cities. Unfortunately for the city's officials, the problem is a legacy from the city's prehistoric past.

During the last ice age, enormous glaciers covered much of Northern Europe. Their weight pushed the Earth's crust in Northern regions like Scotland, resulting in relative rises in the land to the South.

Once the glaciers melted, the crust ""rebounded"" resulting in Scotland rising at around 1 mm a year. London, on the other hand, is sinking at around the same rate - making it increasingly prone to sea-level rise.

As a result, the enormous Thames Barrier, that first opened in 1984 to mitigate this issue, was expected to only be used 2-3 times a year to protect it from one-in-100-year floods.

Advertisement

In fact, it is currently being used around 6-7 times a year.

7. Dhaka, Bangladesh

Dhaka in Bangladesh is yet another city sinking under its own weight. Currently sinking at around 1.5 cm a year, the cities woes are a combination of plate tectonics, groundwater extraction, and sea-level rise.

The Bay of Bengal is rising at around 10 times the global average which has already resulted in millions of people migrating from surrounded coastal villages to the city's slums. This population needs to be supplied with potable water leading to excessive groundwater extraction that isn't helping the situation.

The Indian plate and Burman sub-plate are also interacting in such a way as to further compound the city's sinking problems.","Mon, 23 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/k7GMYX2gGZ/sizes/sinking-cities_md.jpg,"['city', 'citys', 'worlds', 'cm', 'york', 'world', 'cities', 'extraction', 'sinking', 'water', 'groundwater']",

At least 15 natural disasters linked to climate change this year caused damage of over $1 billion and seven of them cost at least $10 billion, British charity Christian Aid said Friday.

This year is set to be the second hottest year in history and each of the disasters in the report has a link with climate change, Christian Aid said.

""Extreme weather, fuelled by climate change, struck every corner of the globe in 2019. From Southern Africa to North America and from Australia and Asia to Europe, floods, storms and fires brought chaos and destruction,"" it said.

Assembling its report from official figures, estimates by NGOs and aid bodies, scientific studies and media reports, the British charity said the disasters displaced millions and caused widespread deaths.

Seven of them caused damage of more than $10 billion (9 billion euros).

These included the floods that ravaged north India, typhoon Lekima in China, Hurricane Dorian in the United States, floods in China, floods in the Midwest and southern United States, typhoon Hagibis in Japan and the California wildfires, the costliest tragedy at $25 billion.

""These figures are likely to be underestimates as they often show only insured losses and do not always take into account other financial costs, such as lost productivity and uninsured losses,"" it said.

Christian Aid said the overwhelming majority of deaths were caused by just two events, in India and southern Africa, which called it ""a reflection of how the world's poorest people pay the heaviest price for the consequences of climate change.

""In contrast, the financial cost was greatest in richer countries: Japan and the United States suffered three of the four most costly events.""

Greenhouse gas emissions are once again set to rise in 2019 after hitting a record in 2018, as extreme weather events—made more likely as the planet warms—struck seemingly everywhere this year.

These include Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, typhoon Hagibis in Japan, a deadly, record-breaking heatwave across much of Europe, wildfires in California and eastern Australia and floods in Venice.

The threat posed by climate change became so stark in 2019 that Indonesia, one of the fastest-growing economies on Earth, decided to move its capital to somewhere that wasn't sinking.

""Unless urgent action is taken to reduce emissions, global temperatures will rise at least another 0.5°C over the next 20 years, and another 2-3°C by the end of the century,"" Christian Aid said.

""The world's weather will continue to become ever-more extreme and people around the world will continue to pay the price. The challenge ahead is to minimise the impacts through deep and rapid emissions cuts.""

Communities across Asia commemorated the 230,000 victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami on Thursday, the 15th anniversary of one of the world's most deadly disasters.

On the morning after Christmas Day in 2004, a 9.1 magnitude quake off northern Sumatra island triggered a tsunami with waves as high as 17.4 metres that swept over vulnerable coastal areas of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, and nine other countries.

Indonesia remembers victims

Indonesians gathered on Thursday in the town of Sigli, in Aceh province, to hold a memorial service for friends and family of the natural disaster.

Aceh's Acting Governor Nova Iriansyah said the anniversary was held to thank the more than 150 countries that assisted in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the area.

""On behalf of the government and people of Aceh today, we formally want to thank more than 150 countries that have been involved in helping rehabilitation and reconstruction,"" Iriansyah said.

In the provincial capital Banda Aceh, relatives visited a mass grave where many victims were buried.

In Aceh, entire villages were flattened and more than 125,000 people perished in the giant waves.

Since then, the area has been largely rebuilt, with some 25,600 residential, commercial, government and school buildings constructed inside a high-risk zone, that had suffered virtually total devastation in 2004.

Muhammad Ikramullah was only 13 when the tsunami hit, killing his parents and younger sibling.



He spent years moving around, living with relatives and his parents' friends until he was able to provide for himself.

""I am still traumatised, I don't think I will ever forget what happened,"" the 28-year-old said.

On December 26, 2004, a monstrous 9.3 magnitude quake struck undersea off the coast of Sumatra, sparking a tsunami nearly 100 feet high that killed more than 230,000 across a string of Indian Ocean countries. (AFP)

Memorial in Thailand

In Thailand, where more than 5,300 people were killed, including tourists visiting resort islands in the Andaman Sea, officials held a memorial ceremony and called for more awareness and preparedness for disasters.

""The government wants to lift safety standards... and build awareness across all sectors in preparing and protecting people against disasters,"" Deputy Interior Minister, Nipon Bunyamanee, said at an opening ceremony.

He said December 26 had been designated national accident prevention day.

Officials later laid wreaths at a memorial centre in Phang Nga province to pay tribute to King Maha Vajiralongkorn's nephew, Bhumi Jensen, who was last seen jet-skiing off the coast when the tsunami hit.

An interfaith service for Muslim, Christian and Buddhist victims was also held.

Survivors from Ban Nam Khem, the worst-hit Thai village, will hold a candlelight vigil in the evening.

At least 1,400 people were killed when waves struck the fishing village.

In India, where more than 10,000 people died in the tsunami, survivors also were to hold memorial ceremonies.

More than 35,000 people died in Sri Lanka.

38,38,FL-2019-000181-IDN,Venice Flood Damage to St. Mark's Cathedral Totals Millions - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/europe/venice-flood-damage-st-marks-cathedral-totals-millions,"VENICE, ITALY - ""Every stone is a treasure,'' says the technical director of St. Mark's Basilica's vestry board, indicating the prized gold-leaf mosaics overhead, the inlaid stone pavement and the marble clad walls of the 923-year-old masterpiece.

And many are vulnerable to the infiltration of sea water during the lagoon city's ever-higher tides.

Constructed atop two previous churches on a site that early Venetians believed was among the most secure in the Canal City, St. Mark's Basilica suffered at least 5 million euros ($5.5 million) in damage during last month's devastating great tides. The first, on Nov. 12, was the highest in 53 years, followed by two above 1.5 meters (4.9 feet), a series of severe inundations never before recorded.

Though the highest was seven centimeters less than the famed 1966 flood of 1.94 meters, St. Mark's chief caretaker, Carlo Alberto Tesserin, said, ''We say this was the worst.’'

Unlike other natural disasters, like, say, an earthquake that leaves images of collapsed bell towers and fallen walls, fresh damage from the Venice floods is so far not visible to the naked eye.

''Someone who comes to Venice to see the high water, and who goes to St. Mark's Square the next day, sees tables in the square, says, `Hey, look, the orchestra is playing. Nothing is wrong here.' While, in reality, what is hidden, is everything we have verified in these days,'' said Tesserin, who submitted the damage estimate earlier this month to city and national officials.

Peaking at 1.87 meters (6.14 feet) above sea level, last months’ great tide was accompanied by wind gusts of up to 120 kph (around 75 mph) that pushed the waters even higher, flooding through the windows in St. Mark's crypt of patriarchs. The gale-force gusts buffeted the Basilica's domes, tearing away lead tiles, Tesserin said. Both floodwaters entering from the windows and the ripping away of lead tiles were firsts in the Basilica's history.

Witnesses reported waves in St. Mark's Square never before seen. The Venice Patriarch told a news conference that they were like waves at the seashore, a first in his experience despite having witnessed `'the piazza full of water many times.’'

""It was the first time that I was truly afraid,'' said Giuseppe Maneschi, the vestry board technical director. The assault was three-pronged: Water was entering from the piazza, through the narthex; from the crypt windows, while also pushing up from below the Basilica. Maneschi worked with others to move precious objects, like a standing crucifix, higher.

The crypt remained under water for nearly 24 hours, while two more exceptional floods over 1.5 meters kept the Basilica closed for a week. Before re-opening, workers washed the Basilica floors four times with fresh water -- a necessary treatment but one that carries risks as the salt is abrasive against pavement stones, Maneschi said.

Salt, not water, is the real culprit. The brackish water is absorbed by the marble columns or cladding and into the brick structure, creeping higher and higher up the Basilica walls and supporting columns. As the water dries, the granules of salt expand to create multiple tiny explosions inside the stone, brick and marble, that weaken their structure.

""Even at a height of 12 meters (nearly 40 feet), we have salt that comes out, that crystallizes,'' Maneschi said. `'The disaster is inside, where we cannot see. But we can monitor with new technology.’'

Past damage, compounded over the years, is evident throughout the Basilica in brittle marble benches and cladding eaten away over the years, in some places exposing the brick walls. Gauze has been placed over vulnerable sections of peacock mosaics in the pavement, which also suffers under the footfalls of around 5 million visitors a year.

Now, architects suspect that concrete barriers built in the 1990s to prevent water from entering the crypt from beneath the Basilica were damaged by the force of last month's floods.

Tesserin said that they believe the water flooding in from the crypt windows was actually a blessing in disguise, creating pressure that prevented the lagoon rising beneath the Basilica from shattering those concrete barriers, called ""vasca,'' or Italian for ""tub.''

A man works in the St. Mark's Basilica crypt in Venice, Italy, Tuesday, Dec. 17, 2019.

Workers last week were removing the crypt's marble flooring, which lies 20 centimeters (eight inches) below sea level, to observe whether there are indeed cracks allowing water to infiltrate.

The Venice landmark includes 130 different kinds of marble -- some which no longer exist -- that tell the story of ancient conquests. Treasures, like the Madonna Nicopeia that accompanied Byzantine armies to battle, populate every corner, more than the average admirer can possibly assimilate in one visit. But the real prize, Tesserin notes, are its 8,500 square meters (91,500 square feet) of mosaics.

It may seem crazy to a modern eye that such a precious Basilica was established at Venice's lowest point. The piazza outside floods at 80 centimeters (around 30 inches), and water passes the narthex into the church at 88 centimeters (reinforced from a previous 65 centimeters), floods the Zen Chapel at 1.2 meters and the baptistery goes under at 1.3 meters.

But Tesserin said that when the third Basilica was built, `'it was in the position that was considered most safe.'' It has become vulnerable with the passage of centuries, due to the subsidence, or sinking of the land, accompanied by a sea level that has risen 12 centimeters over the last 50 years, and climate change, which has made forecasting high tides in Venice more difficult.

Damage can be seen on the bottom of a column of precious Aquitaine marble in the narthex. The capitals are carved with images of lions and eagles, indicating they are of imperial origin and not religious, and therefore believed to have been sacked from Constantinople during the fourth Crusade, Maneschi said. Analysis only this year indicates that the capitals were made even more ornate by gold leaf covering and lapis lazuli inserts -- which have long disappeared.

The base of one of the decorative columns is badly corroded. But the dark Aquitaine marble prized by ancient civilizations can no longer be found.

""The day it falls, we will replace it with another marble. But as long as it resists, we will keep this,'' Maneschi said.","Tue, 24 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-12/venice2_0.jpg,"['centimeters', 'meters', 'flood', 'st', 'marble', 'maneschi', 'crypt', 'damage', 'cathedral', 'marks', 'totals', 'venice', 'basilica', 'water', 'millions']", 
39,39,FL-2019-000181-IDN,Nature's fury 2019: A year of extremes for India - Mongabay-India,https://india.mongabay.com/2019/12/natures-fury-2019-a-year-of-extremes-for-india/,"India was hit by record extreme events in 2019 that impacted human and animal lives, displaced millions and caused unprecedented damage to property.

Globally, 2019 concludes a decade of exceptional heat and high-impact weather.

Experts have called for urgent action as climate change increases the vulnerability to extreme weather events.

Record extreme events exacted a heavy toll on human, animal lives and property in India as a high-impact mix of seven cyclones, the heaviest monsoon in 25 years, floods that killed thousands of people and one of the longest heatwaves in three-decade, pummeled the country.

Mincing no words, the World Meteorological Organisation said 2019 concludes a decade of exceptional global heat and high-impact weather. On a day-to-day basis, the impacts of climate change play out through extreme and “abnormal” weather.

In a statement at the 25th iteration of the United Nation’s Conference of Parties (COP 25) in Madrid, Spain, the Organisation listed the delayed onset and withdrawal of Indian monsoon and cyclone Fani as among the year’s “high impact” events. As many as 22 million people would be displaced by December 31, 2019, due to extreme weather events, the WMO said.

In four years (2014-2017), over 5,800 people and 10,000 cattle died due to extreme weather events like cold wave, heatwave, heavy rainfall resulting in floods, hailstorm, lightning and cyclonic storms. Of these, at least 3,650 were due to heat waves and cold waves alone, notes the draft of India’s report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Data analysed by Mongabay-India revealed that in 2019 monsoon season, till August, at least 1,351 people died in India due to floods, heavy rainfall and landslides compared to over 1,550 people in 2018.

According to a report by Christian Aid, a UK-based charity organisation, cyclone Fani, which hit India and Bangladesh, displaced 3.4 million people and uprooted more than 10 million trees in India.

The country also witnessed a 113.74 percent increase in forest fires in a span of a year between 2018 and 2019. According to the Forest Survey of India, nearly 36 percent of the country’s forests are prone to fires and of this, over 10 percent are highly prone.

Data analysis also brought to the fore the burden of lightning deaths – lightning strikes claimed the most number of lives between 2001 and 2014, among deaths due to exposure to severe weather.

As this year draws to a close, we take a look at the stories that Mongabay-India produced on extreme weather events, their immediate and potentially long-term impacts on humans and animals, how they affect the vulnerable groups and what solutions may work in the future. Our content, spanning across Environment and Health, Flood and Drought, and Environment and Her series, reflects how scientific data and ground-truthing waltz in step to create powerful, inclusive narratives.

Upping the ante for disaster management in cyclone-prone Odisha

As the weekend began for the rest of the world, extremely severe cyclonic storm Fani tore into the east coast of India battering Odisha on May 3 and claiming over 30 lives. The cyclone, one of the rarest summer cyclones, prompted an evacuation of a “record 1.2 million people in 24 hours” to shelters before it made landfall in the temple town of Puri.

Mongabay-India combined ground reporting and mined data to analyse why and how Odisha needs to up its ante in disaster management despite winning international laurels for its work since the deadly Supercyclone 1999 that killed 10,000 people.

Poor urban neighbourhoods more vulnerable to extended effects of heat

Barely a month after Fani’s devastation, India clinched global headlines again in June 2019. The country was sizzling as it battled one of the longest heatwaves in three decades. Mongabay-India discussed how the heatwave hit the urban poor hard based on a study that said poor urban neighbourhoods are more vulnerable to the extended effects of heat.

People in densely built, low-income neighbourhoods, with no open green spaces, remain unsheltered from heat even at night. As heat action plans evolve for a few Indian cities, they should take into account thermal indices, not just temperature thresholds, recommends the study.

As floods repeat this year in Kerala, experts point to climate change

The south India state of Kerala, which boasted steady monsoons and salubrious climate, grappled with a deluge in August, 2019, a repeat of the devastating floods that killed over 300 people, exactly a year ago.

[Commentary] Is Indian monsoon turning into a string of extreme weather events?

Mongabay-India’s Managing Editor S. Gopikrishna Warrier analysed the calendrical reliability of the Indian monsoon that has changed over the past few years, impacting agriculture and in turn, the economy. While the awareness of the issue is reflected in national-level policy, to develop effective policy plans it is necessary to have models that project scenarios at smaller scales – at state, district and location levels.

Climate change increases India’s vulnerability to extreme weather events: Report

In just four years (2014-2017), over 5,800 people and thousands of animals in India have lost their lives to “extremes of temperature, rainfall and tropical cyclones.” Increase in frequency and intensity of such disasters related to climate change impacts on the weather systems is a serious concern, notes the draft of India’s report to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Delayed Indian monsoon, Cyclone Fani ‘high impact’ events of 2019

The delayed onset and withdrawal of Indian monsoon and cyclone Fani were among the “high impact” events of 2019, the World Meteorological Organisation provisional statement on the State of the Global Climate said. The strong monsoon also impacted coal production and consumption in the country, where emissions are projected to rise by 1.8 percent in 2019, considerably lower than in 2018, according to the Global Carbon Budget (GCB) report.

If we do not take urgent climate action now, then we are heading for a temperature increase of more than three degrees Celsius by the end of the century, with ever more harmful impacts on human wellbeing, WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas warned.

[Commentary] Turning to the skies for search and rescue during floods

Scientists from the Indian Institute for Human Settlements have used freely available images from the satellite Sentinel-1, in combination with the open-source tool Google Earth Engine, to develop maps of the recent Assam and Bihar floods. Using this as an illustrative example, they call for using such technologies to aid search and rescue missions during disasters, an important element of disaster preparedness.

After cyclone Fani, women in a migrant fishing community start resilience fund

Women in a migrant fishing community in Odisha have created a resilience fund to shield themselves from disasters in the aftermath of cyclone Fani. Parts along the Odisha coast are vulnerable to cyclones, erosion and sea-level rise. Mapping resilience of women-led households and learning from their behaviour can provide insights to prepare better for the future.

“The allegation that the Islamic organizations receive large funds is very painful and discredits us at the same time. It's the same as character assassination,” said Muhyidin Junaidi, chairperson of the Foreign Relations and International Cooperation of the Indonesia’s Council of Islamic Clerics (Ulema), better known as MUI.

Muhyidin – who led the Chinese-funded delegation to Xinjiang last February – told VOA by telephone: “We cannot be bought with money. We, God willing, are strict and we have high integrity for the sake of truth.” According to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), China is waging a campaign of surveillance, political and cultural indoctrination against Uighurs, Kazakhs and other Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

Details Leak From China's Mass Detention Camps in Xinjiang; US Official Blasts 'Concentration Camps' New leak of internal Chinese documents unveiled China's calculated strategy of forced ideological and behavioral indoctrination against Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang

Original report

In its December 11 edition, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that in an effort to gain international support and to shape positive public opinion, China funded the visit of a group of Indonesian religious leaders, community leaders and journalists to Xinjiang.

“... bolstered by donations and other financial support, China helped blunt criticism of its treatment of the Uighurs by Muslim-majority countries, in contrast to the strong condemnation expressed by the U.S. and other Western nations,” the WSJ report said.

The WSJ further reported how the perception in Indonesia of the treatment of the Muslim minorities by China has changed since the visit to several training centers and presentations by Chinese authorities on the dangers of terrorist attacks by the Uighurs.

Allegations denied

In an interview with VOA on February 24, shortly after the trip to Xinjiang, Robikin Emhas, the executive board chief of Nahdlatul Ulema (NU), Indonesia’s largest Islamic organization, denied that the Chinese government was arresting and persecuting Muslim Uighurs. He also dismissed the existence of “concentration camps” in Xinjiang.

“I did not find the exile camps and prisons as referred to in the news,” Emhas stressed in the interview.

China is estimated to have detained up to 1 million minority Muslim Uighurs in prison-like detention centers. The detentions come on top of harsh travel restrictions and a massive state surveillance.

Emhas said the delegation visited Hotan and Kashgar in Xinjiang Province, where he appealed to the local authorities to allow the Uighurs to practice their faith.

“... We remain hopeful that freedom to embrace religion is also accompanied by freedom to practice it in worship, wherever and whenever, according to the provisions of each religion,” he told VOA, adding that observing a faith is “a fundamental right.”

Minimal interaction

Muhyidin Junaidi, the MUI chairman, said the Indonesian delegation had requested that a meeting with Uighurs without restrictions and supervision. He said that the goal was for the Indonesian delegation to get accurate and balanced information.

“But facts on the ground were different as everything had been prearranged in such a way. The schedule was very tight. There was no access to interact with the local community without escort,” he said, adding that “reporters were not allowed to cover news without an escort.”

Muhyidin said the delegation also including leaders of Muhammadiyah, Indonesia’s second largest Islamic organization. According to Muhyidin, the group was only invited to the Vocational Training Center, where the Muslim participants were considered “radicals” by Chinese authorities.

“During the training, they are prohibited from worshiping, fasting and reading the Quran,” Muhyidin said. “They are under close surveillance, with CCTV cameras in every corner. Their activities are always monitored.”

Muhyidin stressed that in the wake of the trip, the Indonesian delegation had released a report submitted to Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi. “We asked that the report be immediately submitted to the Chinese ambassador in Jakarta,” he said.

China’s issues

In a meeting with the media in Jakarta on Monday, Deputy Director of Civil and Political Rights, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Indah Nuria Savitri said, “Indonesia has concerns about the Uighurs, but we prioritized the mechanism of bilateral consultation and discussion with China. China has an internal mechanism and we respect it.”

Indah Nuria stressed that Indonesia believed China has the capability to resolve its internal issue.

Indonesia’s Foreign Ministry said it did not dispute nor accept the existence of detention camps holding Uighurs and other Muslims.

“The internal settlement must be respected and China has done it. We are just waiting for the progress,” she said.

Secret Documents

A trove of documents, obtained and published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), revealed the blueprints and tactics behind an intensifying campaign against Uighurs, Kazakhs and other Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

The leaked internal documents and communications were obtained and published last month. This followed the leak of 400 pages of internal documents to The New York Times.

On November 25, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang refuted the new document leak, saying issues surrounding Uighur Muslims are ""purely China's internal affairs.""

Remnants of what became known as the second Grote Mandrenke or great drowning, cover walls, and fill shelves, boxes and drawers in an inconspicuous wooden building on Pellworm — part of what was once a larger island that drowned in the devastating storm.

Collected by Helmut Bahnsen during decades of low-tide walks through the mudflats surrounding his native Pellworm, the tiles, early tools, thimbles, pottery and human skulls are testimony to settlements that once existed where the North Sea ebbs and flows as if it has nothing to hide.

Though some of the ""couple of million"" remnants of lives lived and lost by the salty northern waters date back to the Stone Age, Roman and early Medieval times, much was swept into the depths on the night of 11 October, 385 years ago. If the coastline had been better protected, Bahnsen says history might have taken a calmer course.



Whenever Helmut Bahnsen finds pieces that fit with each other, he glues them together

Safe behind coastal defenses

These days the dikes that surround the island and stretch along much of Germany's North Sea coastline, can be as high as eight meters and as wide as five, with the newest among them designed to be topped up if sea levels rise higher than currently predicted. In many places, these giant green defenses are all that keeps the sea from low-lying land.

But that proximity doesn't concern Ernst August Thams, who works on dike maintenance on Pellworm.

""We've been on the island for hundreds of years, and we know we have to deal with the sea,"" Thams told DW. ""The dikes are in excellent condition, I'm not worried.""

He is convinced they're the ""only option"" for protecting the island.

Flooding with intent

But three years ago, when the town of Husum over on the mainland was considering what to do with a particular piece of shoreline, a very different idea was put forward. It was to take some of the pressure off the dikes by creating a small area of coastline where the sea would have been able to encroach on the land.

Residents in the coastal town of Husum weren't keen on the idea of allowing the sea to inundate certain parts of the land

Known as managed realignment or managed retreat, the process allows inundation by shortening, lowering or moving existing defenses inland, or by extending floodplains in order to give water somewhere to go. Though not widely used, conservationists often regard it as an alternative means of protection.

But Hans-Ulrich Rösner, who heads up the Wadden Sea office of conservation group WWF admits that it's a hard message to sell.

""Allowing water to come closer is a frightening concept for the average human being,"" he said. ""You can only do it when people are convinced.""

In Husum, they weren't.

Mayor Uwe Schmitz believes it was ultimately the right decision not to press ahead with the proposed project in Husum, but he doesn't rule out similar ventures in the years ahead.

""There will certainly be more heavy rainfall events in the future that mean we'll have to consider using areas of agricultural land as floodplains,"" Schmitz told DW. ""But these are ethical issues that go against the culture of the northern people who have not only defended themselves from the sea for centuries, but sought to wrest land from it.""

Will agriculture remain a viable option in coastal regions?

Location, location, location

John Riby, a fellow of the UK Institution of Civil Engineers who has worked on flood and coastal protection issues for many years, describes managed realignment as ""working with nature for the benefit of man"", and says the key to its success is the choice of location.

He cites the Tees Estuary in northern England — home to industrial sites including a nuclear power plant and petrochemical companies at risk of inundation — as one such place.

When businesses in the area became so badly affected by flooding that they sometimes had to close down while the water subsided, a plan for managed retreat was set in motion.

""The defenses were set back to allow space for the water without impacting the businesses,"" Riby explained.

""Convention says you would have built new defenses on the river, but because they had the ability to allow water to inundate the floodplains and channel water into the right location, they were able to create defenses that not only protected these businesses, but also created quite a lot of natural habitat for seals and flora and fauna of all sorts,"" Riby said.

​​Mudflats and coastal habitats are home to plenty of flora and fauna

Retreating when it is still manageable

But much coastline around the world is given over to residential development, and that complicates things. Asking people to leave their homes and communities to make way for an adaptation process, is, Riby says, ""a very blunt instrument.""

""Where you've got housing, is not a great place to be putting managed realignment,"" he said.

Yet in some cases, the decision to retreat is voluntary. In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, which crashed across the Carribean and the US in 2012, three waterfront communities in the New York borough of Staten Island gradually decided to approach the state to buy their land. With around 90 percent of residents on board, a buy-out was agreed.

US photographer and filmmaker Nathan Kensinger who has spent many years documenting New York waterfronts, accompanied the process of people moving out and wildlife moving in.

His sometimes eerie images of toys, clothes and furniture left in and around deserted homes speak volumes about the power of the ocean in a warming world. Most of what once constituted these communities is now long gone.

This road in Oakwood Beach, Staten Island, used to be walked and driven down as part of a thriving community. It now floods regularly and is giving way to nature

""The idea with this managed retreat program was to create a buffer zone next to the ocean,"" Kensinger told DW. ""They planted a wetland where the homes once stood, and within the neighborhoods that are furthest along, you now see fields of wild flowers and grasses and empty streets and empty blocs.""

A far cry, but no great distance from Manhattan, the ""holdouts"" — the houses left standing — are now surrounded by marshlands and streets that flood during rainstorms.

Kensinger says they're not obliged to move away, but believes more and more waterfront neighborhoods in the state of New York will ultimately have to embrace the idea of managed retreat.

""Otherwise they're going to be forced to take a retreat that is much less planned out, and much more a response to a disaster.""

Because as the fragments of former lives back in a small museum on the German island of Pellworm so boldly illustrate, the one thing that will never stop moving is the sea itself.","Mon, 23 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/50628839_6.jpg,"['flooding', 'managed', 'northern', 'island', 'north', 'riby', 'sea', 'retreat', 'defenses', 'coastal', 'cure', 'rising', 'seas', 'water']",

Africa felt the effects of those changes in 2019, experiencing cyclones, droughts and unstoppable rains that jeopardized livelihoods.

Sixty-two-year-old David Kemboi sorts out dry maize stalks on his 21-hectare farm in Kenya's Trans Nzoia County.

He turns the stalks of what could have been a bountiful harvest into silage — for feeding his 15 herd of cattle.

He said the heavy rains that have rocked different parts of Eastern Africa cause the crops to fail.

""At the time of growing crops we expected optimum yields, we had invested heavily on all the crops that we grew, but unfortunately, we were not able to get a good harvest out of all that, which means a lot of money was just thrown to the dogs. We didn't get anything out of that and we do not expect to get anything elsewhere other than from this land because we depend on rain-fed agriculture,"" he said.

Trans Nzoia county where Kemboi settled after retirement in 2017 is known for growing predominantly maize, Kenya's staple food.

Apart from the excessive rain, farmers in the area have faced pests and disease challenges.

""Every time we go to harvest the maize, there is rain and when it gets wet, it gets spoiled very quickly. That one has had adverse effects in growing of maize and also in beans. Beans, the first crop we didn't have any harvest at all. It all went bad because of these heavy rains,"" said Kemboi.

Widespread flooding

Millions of people have been displaced as a result of widespread flooding this year across large parts of Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan and Ethiopia.

The floods have led to hundreds of deaths. In November, South Sudan declared a state of emergency in 27 affected areas with close to a million people affected.

The Kenya Meteorological Department attributes the rains to an irregularity known as Indian Ocean dipole, an oscillation of surface temperature of the sea, which brings weather extremes to countries neighboring the Indian Ocean.

Benard Chanzu is the deputy director of Kenya's Meteorological services. He said nearly all of Kenya has received above-average rainfall this year.

""In some stations, I can quote like Meru stations, we have seen records which are showing that what has been received is more than 200 percent of the long term average, that is what is usually received in the area,"" said Chanzu.

More extreme weather ahead

With levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere climbing to new highs, Dr. John Recha, a scientist specializing in climate and agriculture research, said Africans can expect more extremes in years to come.

""We will therefore have more effects of climate change affecting the weather patterns specifically the rainfall patterns, climate change will be more intense and therefore the climate variability that is having these extreme events of the droughts and the floods will be more frequent and more intense going into the future,"" he said.

The solution for Kemboi and other farmers, according to experts like Recha, lies on adapting to climate change.

That, he said, would require help from government and agencies to implement new agricultural practices such as alternative irrigation methods and efficient water storage for farmers.","Mon, 23 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-12/reuters_kenya_landslides_25Nov19.jpg,"['effects', 'jeopardize', 'received', 'rains', 'change', 'east', 'maize', 'harvest', 'patterns', 'climate', 'nzoia', 'weather', 'africa', 'inescapable', 'kenyas', 'kenya', 'livelihoods']",

By Saeed Al-Batati

SAWIA VALLEY, Yemen, Dec 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The torrential floods and brutal droughts of recent years have left their mark on this valley in southeast Yemen.

A road that links Mukalla, the capital of Hadramout province, with its remote rural villages has been almost wiped out by repeated landslides. Giant boulders lie strewn along the road, alongside the trunks of downed trees.

""The weather now is between two extremes: heavy drought or destructive brief floods and rains,"" said Omer Abu Baker a farmer and shepherd from Hara'a, a village overlooking the Sawia Valley floor.

Civil-war-torn Yemen faces vast challenges, from a struggling economy and collapsing health system to some of the world's worst shortages of food, water and jobs.

But more severe weather linked to climate change - and a shortage of funding to deal with it - is making life even harder.

The families who live in this part of southern Yemen say weather patterns have become particularly severe since 2015, when Cyclone Chapala - the strongest recorded storm to hit the region - triggered heavy rains and severe flooding.

In 2018, Yemen was again hit by Cyclone Luban, which killed 14 people.

Abu Baker said the worsening weather has driven herders to relocate both their homes and their animals, to try to avoid more losses.

""First Chapala devastated our village and farms, then Luban ruined that which was left behind,"" Abu Baker said in his quick Bedouin accent.

""I am now in my 80s (and) I can tell you that I have never seen such destructive floods and rains. Rains are now associated with destruction,"" he said.

For years, ahead of the rainy season, farmers have cleaned water channels, covered their farmland with fertiliser and then waited for the sky to open.

That old pattern, however, is being abandoned, Abu Baker said.

""Now, we do nothing as we think floods would wash away all our defenses,"" he said.

When Cyclone Luban struck the valley last year, the ensuing floods buried his farms in muddy silt. It also left many villages isolated for 10 days - and disrupted field work for six months, he said.

Abu Baker and his family were plunged into debt in order to pay for the removal of mud blocking the farm's irrigation well and to repair damaged flood-control banks, he said.

""We could not irrigate the farm for six months and then we managed to restore crops gradually,"" Abu Baker said, adding that the family took the risk of borrowing money for repairs as the farm grows high-earning crops including tobacco, lemon and pumpkin.

Like many of the nomadic people in the region, he and other residents say they do not understand why floods and downpours are gaining in strength.

The problem, they say, must be an angry God.

""The strong rains and floods are due to our sins. People do not pray,"" Abu Baker said, adding he has never heard about climate changes.

Now, when he hears news of a storm on the way, the farmer and his family stay indoors, praying.

Not all those hit by the worsening storms have been able to recover.

Like many people who lost the use of their farms to storm damage, farmer Omer Hassan, 55, decided to move permanently to Mukalla.

Hassan, a father of six, said his fields and cattle used to earn his family sufficient income, until the second cyclone ""wiped out the remaining land"".

Today he works as a security guard and land broker, and keeps an eye on his remaining sheep and goats to earn a living.

""I cannot go back to my village as I cannot afford to repair my land. I wish someone could help,"" he said at his brother's home on a hilltop in the eastern outskirts of Mukalla.

BARRIERS TO ADAPTING

Mohammed Barashed, a professor of geomorphology at Hadramout University, said adapting to the harsher weather conditions will require radical changes in the way houses and cities are built, to reduce the risks.

""People have to change roofs of their houses. There should be a law criminalizing building homes on water courses,"" said Barashed, who published a paper in 2017 about the impacts of Cyclone Chapala on Hadramout.

If cyclones continue to grow in strength and changes aren't made, the country risks losing roads, bridges and many of its mud-constructed houses, he warned.

But Yemeni authorities say finding the money to respond to the growing threats is difficult.

The surge in cyclones coincided with an upswing in violence in the country, which led to the country's oil and gas revenue drying up, said Faraj Salmeen Al Bahsani, the governor of Hadramout.

He told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that his province has a huge shortfall in funding needed to repair damage from previous cyclones and get ready for coming threats.

""When we hear a cyclone will hit the province, we clean water courses and deploy the army. (But) floods have destroyed agricultural lands (and) electricity towers and washed away land bridges,"" he said.

""Our resources and capabilities are meager. We are in need of an advanced meteorological center that can detect cyclones.""

She and her parents survived, but her two sisters were killed on that fateful day on Dec. 26, 2004.

Fifteen years on, she frequently relives the traumatic events when recounting her story to visitors at the Aceh Tsunami Museum, where she works as a guide.

In doing so, she hopes to spread the lessons learned from her heartbreaking experience - such as the importance of early warning systems and fleeing to higher ground when an alarm is raised or if there is an earthquake.

“Since I’d experienced the trauma of tsunami, when I meet visitors I share my experiences... so that they will never forget,” said the 44-year-old. The museum where she works, built to commemorate the disaster, also has an education center and acts as a disaster shelter.

More than 230,000 people were killed in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand and nine other countries after a 9.1 magnitude quake off the coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province triggered a tsunami as high as 17.4 meters (57 feet).

Northern Aceh province bore the brunt of the disaster, where a total of 128,858 were killed and another 37,087 are still listed as missing, according to data compiled by the government and aid agencies.

Many lost their lives simply because there was little information on what to do.

“I always tell the younger generation if you live or near to the beach areas like us, and if there is a strong earthquake after the shock has stopped just run away,” said Mundiyah binti Sahan, 70, who sell souvenirs near a spot where a boat washed ashore by the tsunami remains lodged atop a building.

Local officials say they have put more efforts into tsunami mitigation and educating the communities.

Almost every village in the province has at least one tsunami-damaged building, which serves as a reminder of the destructive power of the waves. More than 25,600 buildings remain in the “red zone” that is considered prone to tsunamis, liquefaction and flooding, according to Banda Aceh’s public works and urban housing agency.

At the museum, kindergarten student Bima al Farizi did not hesitate when asked what she should do in the event of an earthquake and a tsunami.

“We should run to higher ground,” she said.","Fri, 20 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191221&t=2&i=1466748076&r=LYNXMPEFBK02Z&w=800,"['aceh', 'visitors', 'run', 'hopes', 'province', 'killed', 'generation', 'near', 'museum', 'works', 'lessons', 'disaster', 'survivor', 'learn', 'tsunami']",

Think sinister chapters of history, eerie folk tales, conspiracy theories, infamous criminals and contemporary issues. This week, we have a look at some of the worst natural disasters ever to hit Luxembourg.

Last Tuesday, a micro-earthquake measuring 1.9 on the Richter scale hit Luxembourg. The quake had its epicenter in Hesperange, the quake went broadly unnoticed and fortunately did not cause any damage or harm. Even though Luxembourg certainly counts as a safe country when it comes to earthquakes and other natural disasters, it would be wrong to think that it has never been fallen prey to natural catastrophes.

Tornadoes

One of the worst tornadoes ever to rip through Luxembourg occurred less than five months ago. As you probably remember, the violent tornado left a trail of destruction in Petange and Bascharage in the Grand Duchy's southwest. Emergency services received more than 1000 calls, countless homes were severely damaged and 19 people sustained injuries. Four months on, the homes of some 26 families are still inhabitable. Images and videos on social media showed the tornado tearing down roofs and throwing debris and tree branches into the air.

Shocking video shows Bascharage roof torn off as tornado passes

It was not Luxembourg's only tornado. In 1999, a tornado hit Wiltz, wrecking several houses, blowing off roofs and wreaking havoc at a local camp site. Material damage was considerable but nobody was injured.

In 1990, another tornado ravaged Schlindermanderscheid in the north of Luxembourg. While it did not claim any victims, the tornado damaged a number of farms and houses. It also knocked over pylons and uprooted around 100 trees.

Fires

Fires are not a rare occurrence but they're seldomly the result of natural factors - and Luxembourg's firefighters have repeatedly proven they're on the ball when it comes to reacting quickly and efficiently. A notable forest fire broke out in the Grand Duchy’s north between Schlindermanderscheid and Consthum in August 2018.

Heatwaves and drought had been scorching Luxembourg for more than a week prior to the fire, which eventually affected an area measuring around 10 hectares. More than 130 firefighters were dispatched to battle the flames and bring the fire under control from two sides. The blaze was raging on a steep slope, which complicated their efforts. It took more than a day to extinguish the flames.

Earthquakes

Speaking as someone who experienced the disastrous Lombok earthquake in Indonesia first-hand last year (6.9 on Richter scale), I believe it's fair to say that Luxembourg's earthquakes have, historically-speaking, been more even-tempered - which does not mean they don't exist. On 22 February 2003, a 5.4 magnitude earthquake rattled the French city Saint Dié. The quake was felt in Luxembourg: around 200 concerned residents phoned the Grand Duchy's emergency call centre. The earthquake did not cause any damage.

Another earthquake caused (minor) panic in 1976. Countless residents reported that windows were trembling and paintings jumping off the walls. Luxembourg, as it turned out, was feeling the shocks of the 1976 6.5 Friuli earthquake, which occurred in northeast Italy. The quake killed 978 people in Italy and 157,000 were left homeless.

An earthquake that many Luxembourgers will probably never forget was the 1992 Roermond earthquake. it was the strongest recorded earthquake in the Netherlands and in Northwestern Europe. It caused considerable damage to buildings in the Netherlands as well as Germany and Belgium. 40 people were injured. Luxembourg escaped unharmed but countless alarmed residents called the emergency services in panic - many of them were worried that something had gone wrong at Cattenom nuclear power plant.

Floodings

The most recent disastrous floodings occurred after heavy rainfall on 1 June 2018. The areas hit the hardest were Greiveldange and Mullerthal. The scenic Mullerthal's hiking trails were severely damaged, several roads and houses destroyed. A number of local businesses were forced to close.

The 2018 floodings were not a first in Luxembourg.The flood risk has historically been one of the highest natural risks in Luxembourg. Some regions have been devastated by floods several times: the Moselle valley in 1983 and the Sure valley in 1993, 1995, 2003 and 2011.

58,58,FL-2019-000181-IDN,Preparing health systems to deal with disasters - Mongabay-India,https://india.mongabay.com/2019/12/preparing-health-systems-to-deal-with-disasters/,"Odisha needs to up its ante in health systems readiness in disasters as climate change contributes to an increase in extreme weather events, said experts and affected citizens.

The focus is now on emerging issues and making health systems more inclusive to embrace a wider proportion of marginalised and overlooked communities in the context of disasters, including persons with disabilities and those with mental health issues.

As the impacts of the rarest of rare cyclones, Fani, continue in Odisha, this piece takes a look back at the state’s history with disasters and the links to health.

“Welcome to the land of cyclone Fani”. “Oh! You are in time for the cyclone season”. These are not unexpected greetings in this corner of the world.

After all, the east Indian state of Odisha has made headlines in the last 20 years for cyclones that ravaged the coastal state, even as recently as May 3, 2019, when Fani, a “rarest of the rare” summer cyclone pummeled the state.

Home to 46 million people, Odisha is often referred to as the disaster capital of the country, for the deadly cocktail of floods, cyclones, and droughts that regularly ravages it. The devastating cyclone Fani clinched a spot among 2019 “high impact” events as announced by the World Meteorological Organisation at 25th iteration of the United Nation’s Conference of Parties (COP 25).

Of the 1019 cyclonic disturbances the Indian subcontinent experienced in the last century, 890 impacted the eastern coast and 129 hit the western coast. As many as 260 cyclonic disturbances had their landfall along the Odisha coast in east India.

The defining moment for disaster management in Odisha came when the 10,000 deaths in the 1999 super cyclone prompted the state to launch a dedicated disaster management authority, an autonomous body. It became the first state in India to do so, saving lives in subsequent disasters and then winning global laurels for its work. Disaster management systems were also aligned with health systems in Odisha, where out of 30 districts of the state, 14 districts are categorised as high damage risk zone, as per the state’s wind and cyclone hazard zones map.

“For example, evacuating pregnant women to shelters on a priority basis during disasters, especially cyclones, is being done consistently and efficiently. Distribution of chlorine tablets to disinfect water, antibiotics and antipyretics, has had positive impacts in controlling infections,” said Shridhar Kadam, Associate Professor, Indian Institute of Public Health-Bhubaneswar.

“The government have also managed to lessen the damage from physical injuries that occur from property destruction during the cyclone event,” Kadam told Mongabay-India.

However, Kadam, as well as other experts, feel with increasing frequency of extreme weather events and emerging health issues, it is time to up the ante.

“In the case of cyclones, early warning systems prevented large scale death and disease in recent years. What happens in case of earthquakes or flash floods,” questioned Kadam, adding that health system readiness must be customised for each category of disaster.

“Rapid Response Teams that cater to each disaster and have updated knowledge on health systems aligned to that specific event will markedly improve readiness,” he said.

Preparing for disasters in the context of health

Odisha’s list of state-specific disasters includes lightning, heatwave, tornado, heavy rainfall and snakebites (other than during flood) in addition to nationally-declared disaster (earthquake) and others.

According to Prabhat Ranjan Mahapatra of Odisha State Disaster Management Agency (OSDMA) the next level in disaster management is to factor in new challenges and prepare for a larger magnitude of a disaster, especially in the context of health.

“For example, we get small quakes in Odisha but not major ones, but if a major one strikes then are we ready? In cyclone Titli in 2018, 50 people died of landslides alone in hilly tribal-dominated areas in the interior of the state. Which means we have to consider health system readiness during disasters in other areas and those that have more vulnerable groups,” said Mahapatra.

“Do we have that level of preparedness?” asked Mahapatra at a consultation workshop on ‘Health system readiness for extreme climate events: Lessons learnt from Cyclone Fani and Way Forward’ organised by Population Council in collaboration with CARE India.

Population researcher Bidhubhushan Mahapatra batted for more research that identifies the vulnerabilities existing in the health system. Additionally, “preparing the system as per community need and the likelihood of disasters,” is also important, Mahapatra of Population Council told Mongabay-India.

One area is the link between poverty and healthcare access. Economic losses from disasters push people into poverty, scuppering their access to medication said Binapani Misra of Odisha-based NGO Society for Women Action Development that works for disaster resilience among women.

“The 1999 supercyclone killed thousands but Fani has taken us back economically by 15 years,” remarked Misra.

“Because of unprecedented damage to livestock, cash crop, particularly coconut and property, Fani affected people were thrown into financial turmoil. This hampered their access to medications in various pockets and many of those affected went to consult quacks because of the absence of healthcare workers in certain areas,” Misra told Mongabay-India.



Skin diseases, poor nutrition and the impact of heatwaves connected with disasters

Misra added that skin diseases became a concern during the cyclone. “This time, after Fani, we didn’t see too many water-borne infections because there were no floods. But we noted skin diseases and fevers emerge after Fani. And many people are still without proper treatment,” Misra said, adding that attention should be given to healthcare workers who often face health risks during disasters.

Food and nutrition security, particularly among children, has also emerged as a major worry. Women in a migrant fishing community in a slum in Puri, where Fani made landfall, told this visiting Mongabay-India correspondent how they struggled to provide cooked food to their children in the cyclone’s aftermath.

“It was tough to see our children go hungry for days following the storm. It took time for us to get cooked food through relief efforts,” recalled 35-year-old Koda Uma, whose family of seven was scattered across cyclone shelters in the ensuing evacuation in Puri’s Penthakatha.

Floods and drought have also been noted to have had an impact on nutrition and thus health, specifically among children in Odisha.

Floods that submerged crops and lead to subsequent crop failure, scuttled children’s growth and development in several pockets in the state said a review paper by ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar, and UNICEF, National Health Mission, Bhubaneswar researchers. Instances of severely weakened children were three times higher in areas affected by floods in comparison to non-flooded areas in Jagatsinghpur district that was affected by floods in 2008, dubbed as the worst in 50 years.

In Odisha’s Balangir district, a chronically drought-prone area, 2010 drought caused a fall in calorie intake among children in two villages, which lead to health problems as well as death from malnutrition among children. Health problems relating to water were common, in addition to weakness, pregnancy-related issues and pre-mature deaths in Balangir and Kendrapara districts after a drought episode said a 2012 study.

Odisha has previously reeled under the impact of heatwaves which returned this year after Fani. In 1998, Odisha was thrust into the limelight when a severe heatwave claimed over 2000 lives. Heatwaves affect Odisha districts, particularly hitting the health and well-being of a large chunk of people employed in the unorganised sector such as labourers, vendors, rickshaw pullers. Long-term heat exposure forces people to stay indoors and lose out on income-generating opportunities. In addition to the unorganised sector, the elderly, children and people living in urban slums, including migrant communities, are among those vulnerable to heatwaves, according to the review paper.

After-effects of Fani continue months later with disabled and mentally ill at a disadvantage

It’s November and R. Pati, a rental car driver in Puri, is still waiting for a proper place to sleep months after Fani flattened his one-room concrete house in summer.

Showing off a plastic bag with clothes and essentials stuffed into it, Pati said this is all he has. “I live in a makeshift shelter and initially I had to nurse a forearm injury from debris falling off during Fani. I am thankful that the injury healed with basic treatment otherwise I could have been disabled. Life is good,” Pati narrated to Mongabay-India with a sarcastic laugh.

Pati’s remarks aren’t off the cuff. Disasters have an impact on disability by disproportionately affecting the disabled and creating a new generation of people with disability, according to the World Health Organisation. The National Disaster Management Authority, which has drafted guidelines on disability and disasters, acknowledges that during the last decade disasters and increasingly climate change have had a significant impact on about 2.68 crores (26.8 million) people with disabilities in India.

In December 2019, the OSDMA announced that it has set up a dedicated cell for issues on disability during a disaster.

Fani’s intensity also revealed the burden of disasters on mental health. A growing body of research has pointed to linkages between mental health and environmental stressors exacerbated by climate change, including tropical cyclones.

Psychosocial support and mental health services are embedded in India’s disaster management framework. Looking forward, Odisha has started building the capacity of local community workers such as accredited social health activist (ASHA) and other health workers to conduct interventions such as active listening, counselling and identifying symptoms of mental stress in the wake of a disaster.

“In the last several cyclones and other disasters, we have been able to save a lot of lives. But are the people satisfied and have they had a convenient stay in cyclone shelters? We now want to focus on sheltering with dignity, especially for women, and minimising inconvenience,” said Prabhat Ranjan Mahapatra.

When Mongabay-India visited a section of cyclone shelters in Puri district, a month after Fani’s occurrence, open defecation, among women, was observed to be quite rampant. Women told this correspondent that they found it uncomfortable to use toilets with men around and the lack of sanitary napkins was also problematic.

Shridhar Kadam of IIPH-Bhubaneswar said apart from policy measures, involving ASHA workers and women-led self-help groups in decision making will enable better communication and access to health services in relevant areas during disasters. One-size fits all solution won’t work.

“For example, chlorine tablets are being distributed by many self-help groups. If they are involved in decision making, then planning and mapping gaps and deciding course of action can be customised in accordance with what the community needs,” Kadam added.

59,59,FL-2019-000181-IDN,US-China trade war hits American farms as bankruptcies soar - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade-war/US-China-trade-war-hits-American-farms-as-bankruptcies-soar,"NEW YORK/CHICAGO -- American farmers who went bankrupt reached a high not seen in eight years because of massive floods and exports depleted by the U.S.-China trade war.

There were 580 Chapter 12 bankruptcy filings during the full year ended September, according to data from the federal court system. The number is up 24% from the same period a year earlier, which had a total of 468 filings.

The hardest hit were Midwestern states. Wisconsin had the highest number of bankruptcies at 48, while Nebraska and Kansas came in next at 37 apiece, followed by Minnesota with 31. Floodwaters inundated much of the region this spring, leaving stretches of land infertile.

James McCune owns 2,400 hectares of farmland in Illinois, but was only able to seed in 325 hectares. He called this ""the worst year"" for farming.

Although the Trump administration is offering subsidies, McCune said he is taking in approximately half the income compared with an average year, and that he has incurred a massive loss.

Farmers have been hit with a double whammy of decreased yields and lower crop prices. Soybeans have slumped in the futures market to less than $10 a bushel. Farm debt is anticipated to hit $416 billion at the end of the year, an all-time high. That has fueled fears that bankruptcies will continue to surge.

The average incomes of corn and soybean farmers has dropped for six consecutive years, according to First Midwest Bancorp., the state's largest agricultural bank. Grain production does not generate the type of substantial earnings that could be secured in the past, said Rebecca King, director of agriculture at First Midwest.

The U.S. trade war with China has also imposed downward pressure on earnings. China used to purchase at least $20 billion worth of U.S. farm products a year, but the volume has shrunk to between $7.5 billion and $7.8 billion this year, said Dale Moore, executive vice president of the American Farm Bureau Federation.

China is expected to purchase $40 billion worth of U.S. farm goods under the limited trade pact reached last week. The farming federation released a statement saying, ""this development is welcome news."" Beijing, however, has yet to confirm the $40 billion figure, raising questions over whether the threshold will be realized.","Thu, 19 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F4%252F9%252F1%252F9%252F24039194-1-eng-GB%252Fcorn%2520and%2520iowa%2520farmer.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['hit', 'bankruptcies', 'states', 'soar', 'worth', 'reached', 'number', 'farms', 'american', 'farm', 'billion', 'mccune', 'uschina', 'purchase', 'war', 'trade', 'hits']", 
60,60,FL-2019-000181-IDN,Be careful of flood damaged cars when buying second hand - Motor1.com UK,https://uk.motor1.com/news/387502/hpi-warns-against-flood-damaged-cars/,"As the UK continues the battle harsh weather conditions, CAP HPI has warned about the dangers of buying flood and water damaged vehicles, despite their temptingly low prices.

More than 730,000 cars are written off each year – more than 2,000 a day – according to HPI, but unfortunately for consumers, more flood damaged cars previously written off are being offered for sale.

""It’s not illegal to professionally repair and sell Category C and D insurance write-off cars, but those that have been declared a Category A and B write-off are only good for the scrap heap or spares; they should never be returned to the roads,"" said Fernando Garcia, consumer director at HPI. ""Unfortunately, fraudsters are willing to patch up and disguise written-off vehicles and sell them on to unsuspecting buyers.""

If a flood damaged car hasn't been repaired properly, it'll likely need entire engine components replaced to ensure that the car can continue to work properly and safely. Brakes, starter motors and catalytic converters are other things that need to be looked at to keep drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe.

What's more, buyers could unknowingly try to sell on their flood damaged cars later on down the line if the car's interior has dried out and has been professionally cleaned, oblivious to the dangers that the car could pose.

""We recommend that buyers considering a used bargain conduct a vehicle history check to reveal if the car has been declared an insurance write-off and importantly, what category write-off it is,"" said Garcia. ""Not all written off cars should be avoided. Category C and D write-offs that have been professionally repaired and declared roadworthy can sometimes present a real bargain.""

HPI’s Used Car Flood Damage Check List

• Are the electrics fried? Check that the windows open and close.

• What’s that smell? Does the interior of the car smell damp or musty or is the seller trying to mask it with air freshener?

• Damp underfoot? Feel the foot wells to check that the carpet is dry and check if there is condensation on the inside of the windows.

• Is that rust? If there are signs of rust or corrosion, check that it matches the age of the car and the car’s mileage.

• Pop up the bonnet – Don’t forget to check under the bonnet for signs of damp or rust.

• Shine a light – Take the car for a test drive and check that the lights all work on the dashboard.

• It’s getting hot in here – Put the heating on – how quickly do the windows steam up?

• Don’t take the risk – Conduct an HPI Check to find out if the car has previously been a write-off.

HPI recommends that due to a growing number of flood-damaged cars that haven’t been subject to an insurance claim likely to make a return to the roads, buyers should get a mechanic to check over the car for damage and expose any problems before they make any offer.","Fri, 13 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/3MQj6/s1/car-submerged-in-flood-water.jpg,"['hand', 'windows', 'second', 'car', 'flood', 'writeoff', 'careful', 'buying', 'category', 'cars', 'hpi', 'check', 'written', 'damaged']",

67,67,FL-2019-000181-IDN,SE Asia Report: Oversupply impacts prices | Brazilian beef hits Jakarta - Beef Central,https://www.beefcentral.com/live-export/se-asia-report/se-asia-report-june-2019-3-3-3-3/,"72nd Edition: November 2019

Key Points

Oversupply causes Indonesian slaughter cattle prices collapse.

Brazilian beef has arrived in Jakarta.

Filipino prices break through the AUD$5 mark.

Slaughter cattle more than $7 per kg live weight in Shanghai.

Indonesia: Slaughter Steers AUD $3.96/kg live weight (Rp9,600 = $1AUD)

Slaughter cattle prices have collapsed as a result of the huge over supply created by the large import figures for June (60k) and July (78k). The indicator rate has fallen from Rp41,000 per kg live weight last month to Rp38,000 in November. Official updated import figures show numbers for August and September were at a much more sensible 45k level while October imports once again shot op to 65,500. Import levels of 40-50,000 feeders per month result in a stable retail market while anything above crashes the price every time.

This oversupply of fresh beef is further compounded by plentiful supplies of Indian buffalo which have finally filled up the cold stores after the shortage earlier in the year.

PT Berdikari (Persero), a state owned company, has imported the first Brazilian beef (supplied by Minerva) into Indonesia during November. While this beef may not reach the retail shelves until later in November or early December it will no doubt put further downward pressure on the price of slaughter cattle at the same time as feedlot numbers are excess to demand. See below a price list and press release photo of the first container arriving in Jakarta. As expected the retail prices are only a little higher than Indian beef and certainly a long way short of fresh beef prices so the product is likely to find a willing market.

African Swine Fever (AFS) was reported in northern Sumatera during early November with large numbers of dead pigs being dumped into local waterways. The press reports suggested that both AFS and Hog Cholera were identified from samples taken from infected animals but as can be seen from the latest FAO ASF update below, the disease is yet to be officially confirmed in Indonesia.

Darwin feeder steer prices for late November have been ranging from AUD$3.25 to $3.40. I have used $3.35 for this month’s indicator price.

Vietnam: Slaughter Steers AUD $4.68 / kg (VND15,800 to $1AUD)

No change in the market rates for live slaughter cattle this month with the indicator rate for slaughter steers holding at Dong 74,000. Import numbers continue at their elevated levels with about 26,000 delivered from Australia during October resulting in the feedlot capacity of around 100,000 being about 70% utilized during November.

The ASF epidemic continues to disrupt the protein markets with retail pork prices up around 30% during November while demand is declining. Beef is a natural beneficiary of this combination of higher pork prices, reduced supplies and ongoing consumer concern about the safety of the product.

Vietnamese cattle farmers in the Mekong Delta are also doing it tough with a recent outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in the region.

China: Slaughter Cattle AUD $6.89 / kg (RMB 4.79 = AUD$)

As expected the prices for live slaughter cattle in China remain strong with Beijing constant at Y32 per kg while the Shanghai price has risen from Y32 to Y34. Y34 with the RMB at 4.79 converts to AUD$7.09 per kg live weight for slaughter cattle in Shanghai. Pork prices have had another rise of 10% or more during November. These rises are despite massive efforts by the Chinese government to import all manner of meat proteins from all over the world. I have even read that although Chinese authorities are cracking down on illegal Indian beef imports they are in serious negotiations with the Indian government to establish a protocol that would permit the legal importation of Indian beef. This make a lot of sense as the product was coming in through the back door anyway so why not tap the largest single herd of buffalo beef at rock bottom prices to help plug the holes left by the missing pork production.

While ASF is the largest protein related problem at the moment the spectre of drought is rearing its ugly head to add to the woes of food producers. And the area of the most extreme drought shown in red on the map below corresponds to some of the most productive agricultural areas in all of China. The challenges just keep on coming. How can China feed one fifth of the world’s population with 1 tenth of the worlds farmland? Add a few diseases, droughts and floods and the job just keeps getting harder. It is no wonder the demand for Australian beef exports to China set new records every month. But that will only last until our drought is finally broken and then there will be very little left to sell to anyone and prices will go through the roof. I once again claim that $4 per kg live weight for feeder cattle will become a reality as soon as drought disappears from the Australian landscape.

Philippines : Slaughter Cattle AUD $5.35 / kg (Peso 34.6 to AUD$1)

Prices of slaughter cattle have crashed through the AUD$5 barrier with a combination of a stronger Peso and a rise of more than 10 Peso per kg for steers during November. Beef and chicken prices have risen in both the wet and supermarkets while pork prices have fallen once again, no doubt associated with the massive disruption created by ASF.

My agent also told me that he met up with some beef traders from the north of Mindanao who were visiting the south to try to find a new supply of beef as theirs had run dry. Unfortunately for them there was little product to be found and only then at prices they were unable to afford. This is another strong indicator that the live trade as well as the box beef trade to the Philippines is likely to ramp up in the near future. And the Philippines is the 10th largest importer of Brazilian beef! See the graph below showing that they imported 27,000 tons in 2018.

Thailand: Slaughter Steers AUD $4.22 / kg (Baht 20.6 to $1AUD)

Slaughter cattle prices have remained steady during November with the indicator rate holding at 87Baht per kg live weight.

In my September report I wrote that the Thai market was looking forward to the opening of a large Chinese abattoir near the Myanmar/China border which would process both Burmese and Thai slaughter cattle. I have now been advised that the new abattoir which is planning to slaughter imported Thai cattle in the very near future is actually located near Kunming. The latest information suggests that it will be up and running during January with demand and prices for Thai cattle expected to rise accordingly.

Petersens’ Quality Meats, Newfarm, Queensland since 1901.

I recently visited Brisbane for a family get-together so all the Aussie relatives could meet our new granddaughter who had flown in with her Mum from the USA. We stayed at a house in Newfarm, a few hundred meters from the Petersens’ butcher shop on James street and about 1 km from a new Woolworths supermarket. As you can see from the photos below the Woolies presentation is outstanding as usual. The instore butcher shop is a ripper with beautifully presented, top quality product at reasonable prices.

So how can a small, traditional style suburban butcher shop compete with the retailing might of Woolies? By doing the sort of value adding that is too hard for the larger companies. As well as the usual broad butcher shop range, the owner and chef , Debra Sandford, offers a huge range of delicious options including meaty soups, pies, Irish stew, curries, stroganoff, lasagne, cheese, sauces, fish, game meat and many more all cooked to order on the premises using local produce wherever possible. This very busy lady offers catering for large parties, supplies a number of restaurants and will even produce vegetarian and vegan meals to order. Woolies is good but they can never complete with that level of creativity, flexibility and owner/operator yard work. Their Christmas ham gets a score of 9.9/10.

If you want to read the original article in BM, click here!]

Here, quick trivia question. What’s this island called?

As the Wikipedia page we took the photo from have attested, the island is known as Borneo, and three countries have their territories on it: Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak), Brunei, and Indonesia (Kalimantan). However, if you have Googled ‘Borneo’ sometime in the past week, you might have gotten a weird answer instead.

Yikes. It would seem that something made Google refer to Borneo as Kalimantan, which might felt a bit jarring to Malaysians as it’s listing off stuff like Gunung Kinabalu and Kuching as things you can find in Kalimantan. With the Indonesian stereotype of claiming everything (except for haze) as theirs, it’s not hard to see how some netizens might have jumped to conclusions and said that the change was due to Indonesia’s request.

Indonesian requested to Google to change the name of Borneo Island on google as Kalimantan (Island in Asia). Now it looks like this ? Sabahan, sarawakian & brunei: wtf pic.twitter.com/XHLWrjFkQl — khae كريم (@khaekarem) December 13, 2019

But is it really Indonesia doing it though? Since nobody seems to know, we’ve sent an email to Google to ask why, but while we’re waiting for them to respond, it should be noted that…

Kalimantan’s been showing up in the news a lot lately, which might be the reason

So what is going on in Kalimantan? Well, a new capital city, for one. Right now, Indonesia’s capital is Jakarta on the island of Java, but the capital will soon be moving to a new location. While the idea of moving the capital away had been around since Soekarno’s time, it was Joko Widodo (aka Jokowi, the current Indonesian president) who seems to be serious enough about it, formally announcing the idea to their Parliament back in August.

“I hereby request your permission to move our national capital to Kalimantan… A capital city is not just a symbol of national identity, but also a representation of the progress of the nation. This is for the realisation of economic equality and justice,” – Joko Widodo, as reported by Channel News Asia.

The new location is set to be on an area in East Kalimantan, affecting some 40,000 hectares of government land in the area, at the staggering cost of IDR466 trillion (roughly RM137.96 billion). As for why East Kalimantan, there are several reasons for that. For one thing, Java is arguably not that big, yet it holds 60% of Indonesia’s population and more than half of its economic activity. Kalimantan is almost four times bigger, and it’s more geographically central among Indonesia’s 17,000 islands.

“The location is very strategic – it’s in the centre of Indonesia and close to urban areas. The burden Jakarta is holding right now is too heavy as the centre of governance, business, finance, trade and services.” – Joko Widodo, as reported by The Guardian.

And like many other overpopulated places, there’s problems like pollution, flooding, and all that other stuff that happens when you cram in too much people in one place. Of interest is that because there’s not enough drinkable water in Jakarta, people have been illegally digging wells, extracting underground water and causing the land to sink as well.

As of now, it is still in the planning stage, with construction expected to start next year and the actual moving to start in 2024. However, some have already questioned the plan’s feasibility, saying that it won’t fix Jakarta’s woes and for the Indonesian government to be wary of corruption within such a large project. Regardless of that, the plan seemed real enough, and Sabah and Sarawak are already preparing themselves for it. We’ve actually written a whole article of how the move would affect Malaysia, so give that a read if you’re interested.

Anyways, with relatively more being said about Kalimantan compared to Borneo lately, news portal Says had theorized that the chatter had impacted Google’s algorithm, causing it to refer to the island as Kalimantan. And if you are to Google ‘Borneo’ now…

It would seem that Borneo is Borneo again

Just as mysteriously as Borneo was suddenly referred to as Kalimantan last week, as of 17th December 2019, the Google results for Borneo showed Borneo again. It might have been due to a small reporting campaign done by netizens irked by the issue, or it could have just been a bug. Truth was, without any official statements from either Google or any of the affected countries, it’s all a big mystery as far as anyone can tell.

Historically, though, people from different sides of the island have always referred to it by different names. The name Borneo was said to be coined in the 14th century, when Borneo was ruled by the Brunei Sultanate. An Italian adventurer, Ludovico of Varthema, who came to Borneo in 1550 had referred to the island as ‘Bornei’. This word was later known as ‘Borneo’ by English and British colonizers. As for Kalimantan, it was said to be from the Sanskrit word ‘Kalamanthana‘ which means ‘island of hot wind‘.

Perhaps that is why Indonesians might refer to the island as Kalimantan, while Malaysians and Bruneians refer to it as Borneo. Regardless of who’s right, Google says we are for now, and that’s all that matters. But still, to be safe, let’s all Google ‘Borneo’ like once a week or something.","Wed, 18 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://cilisos.my/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cover-11.jpg,"['mysteriously', 'kalimantan', 'island', 'sabah', 'indonesias', 'capital', 'sarawak', 'week', 'google', 'widodo', 'refer', 'right', 'indonesia', 'borneo']",

During the week of Northeast Monsoon season, the weather remain dry in Mekong sub-region, as several isolated hotspots were detected in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Thailand. According to the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC), smoke plumes in Thailand could be observed from some of the hotspots, and air quality at Very Unhealthy level was observed at the Saraburi province. Meanwhile, wet conditions are generally occurring the southern part of ASEAN region and have caused several flooding events.

HIGHLIGHT:

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) reported that a tectonic 6.9 magnitude earthquake with 3 km depth, struck Davao del Sur, Mindanao island, the Philippines on Sunday, 15 December 2019 at 13:11 (UTC+7). The earthquake was located on 6.80°N, 125.20°E, 9 km Northwest of Matanao municipality. The Philippine’s National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) reported that twelve (12) municipalities/cities in Regions XI and XII had power outages during the onset of the earthquake, which were restored immediately. Nine (9) municipalities/cities in these regions declared suspension of classes on 16 December 2019. At present, ground assessment is still ongoing. Region XI (Davao Region) is currently on RED alert status and closely monitoring damages and other after effects of the incident.

HYDRO-METEO-CLIMATOLOGICAL:

As the Northeast Monsoon continues, wet conditions are found in the southern ASEAN region, particularly in the equatorial area, where several flooding events have been reported.

Meanwhile, dry weather happens across the Mekong sub-region as the onset of dry season had started.

However, no drought events have been reported yet.

GEOPHYSICAL:

There were seven (7) earthquake events with magnitude 5.0 and above that occurred last week, five (5) in Indonesia (BMKG) and two (2) in the Philippines (PHIVOLCS).

70,70,FL-2019-000181-IDN,Trump squeezes Thailand in trade row over chemicals ban - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Asia-Insight/Trump-squeezes-Thailand-in-trade-row-over-chemicals-ban,"BANGKOK -- On Nov. 27, Thailand surrendered to the U.S.

Southeast Asia's second-largest economy suspended an imminent move to ban three agrochemicals over safety fears. The restrictions could have led to a significant reduction in American agricultural shipments to the kingdom. The Donald Trump administration, however, knew how to hit Thailand where it hurts.

Suddenly, a country that had largely been a spectator in the trade war is grappling with the effects of the ""America First"" agenda head-on. And there may be more pressure to come, given Thailand's growing trade surplus with the U.S. -- always a Trump pet peeve.

The chemicals in question are a pesticide called chlorpyrifos and the herbicides paraquat and glyphosate, better known as Roundup. Thailand is hardly the only country concerned about them. The European Union has banned paraquat, as contact with it can cause chronic health issues and ingestion can be deadly. Vietnam and Malaysia are scheduled to prohibit it on Jan. 1.

Meanwhile, thousands of plaintiffs have launched legal action in the U.S. over Roundup, claiming the widely used weed killer causes cancer. German producer Bayer insists it is safe, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency agrees. But the World Health Organization's research agency found it to be ""probably"" carcinogenic in 2015.

Either way, when the Thai government's National Hazardous Substances Committee voted in October to ban the three chemicals effective Dec. 1, it set Bangkok on a collision course with Washington.

The U.S. backlash was swift.

A few days after the Hazardous Substances Committee vote, the United States Trade Representative announced a suspension of tariff exemptions for Thai exports to the U.S. under its Generalized System of Preference, or GSP. Motorbikes and seafood products are among the 573 items vulnerable to tariffs starting April 25, 2020.

The USTR attributed the suspension to Thailand's poor labor conditions and limited rights for unionization in certain industries. But many economists do not buy this.

""President Trump has not placed importance on workers' rights,"" said Somchai Phakhaphatwiwat, a political economist from Thammasat University. ""The U.S. is using Trump's America First policy as a tool to solve the trade balance and also to show that Washington is not pleased about Thailand's close relationship with China.""

The suspension of the GSP, he suggested, would have come sooner or later.

Around the time of the USTR decision, Agriculture Undersecretary Ted McKinney sent a letter to Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, urging him to postpone the ban on glyphosate specifically. ""Should a ban be implemented, it would severely impact Thailand's imports of agricultural commodities such as soybean and wheats,"" wrote McKinney, who earlier in his career spent nearly two decades working for agrochemical giant Dow AgroSciences.

Though the proposed ban did not include actual farm produce, Thai farmers worried about a competitive disadvantage were calling on Prayuth's government to ban imports of crops from countries where the chemicals are used -- including the U.S.

According to McKinney's department, the U.S. exported $594 million worth of soybeans and $180 million of wheat to Thailand in 2018.

Russ Nicely, agricultural counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, followed up with another letter, saying the policy would cost Thai farmers between 75 billion to 125 billion baht ($2.4 billion to $4.1 billion) if they have to use more expensive alternative chemicals instead.

Nicely's letter unnerved farmers who were already wary of the effects on profits and productivity.

Bangkok quickly backtracked. Industry Minister Suriya Juangroongruangkit announced that the ban on paraquat and chlorpyrifos would be put off until June 1, and that Roundup would be only mildly restricted. Even the leader of the Bhumjaithai Party -- a driving force behind the ban -- changed his tune.

Bhumjaithai is an important member of Prayuth's post-junta coalition government. Party leader Anutin Charnvirakul, who serves as deputy prime minister and minister of public health, had declared in October that he would resign if the chemicals were not prohibited.

""Banning toxic substances and promoting the health of Thai people have always been the focus of the Bhumjaithai Party,"" Anutin said. ""If I can't get my people to agree with me, then I will quit.""

But after Suriya's announcement, Anutin only said he was disappointed but would respect the decision.

In the background of all this is Thailand's trade surplus. The Trump administration continues to push other countries to correct such imbalances. China has been the most visible target, but the heat on Thailand is rising.

U.S. Census Bureau data shows Thailand's surplus versus the U.S. stood at $19.4 billion in 2018. This was less than China's $419.5 billion surplus, Japan's $67.1 billion or even Vietnam's $39.4 billion and Malaysia's $26.3 billion. But Thailand's figure is projected to increase this year, and it is no secret that it is relying on America more as the global economy slows.

The U.S. is Thailand's third-largest trade partner after China and Japan. But in the January-October period of this year, Thailand recorded export growth to only one of its top 15 trade partners -- the U.S. This gives Trump leverage.

The Trump administration's countermeasures hit sore spots for Prayuth.

One of the prime minister's most important election promises was to lift farmers out of poverty and close the gap between haves and have-nots. This year, alternating droughts and floods made support for growers even more crucial.

The agrochemical ban was partly an attempt to push farmers to switch to value-added organic crops as opposed to commodity-grade ones. In the long run, this could help to raise incomes and reduce the impact of market fluctuations.

The letter from the U.S. Embassy, however, raised alarm among farmers by suggesting their day-to-day struggles were about to get worse, not better.

Experts suggest the Thai government should have been more careful about irking the U.S. ""Phasing out the use of chemical pesticide needs to be planned well, along with phasing in organic farming,"" said Pavida Pananond, an assistant professor of international business at Thammasat Business School. ""The burden of change should not be placed solely on farmers, who are not making much to begin with.""

With Thailand's vulnerabilities so apparent, Trump may be tempted to tighten the screws further.

The two sides are expected to continue negotiating on the termination of the GSP privileges until the decision takes effect in April. ""There's still time to renegotiate the underlying issue of workers' rights,"" U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said when he visited Bangkok to attend the East Asia Summit.

The U.S. has another card up its sleeve: It could label Thailand a currency manipulator.

The baht is trading at its highest level against the dollar since 2013. Prayuth's government and the Bank of Thailand hope to guide it down, in part with measures to promote capital outflows and discourage inflows. The central bank has cut its policy rate twice this year, matching the all-time low.

Bangkok also aims to reinvigorate slumping exports. Although U.S.-bound growth hit double digits, Thailand's overall outbound shipments decreased by 2.35% in the first 10 months of 2019. However, if the White House perceives Thai policies as pushback against the America First campaign, it could deploy the manipulator tag, just as it did for Malaysia and Vietnam in May.

Currency manipulators are subject to sanctions against their goods and businesses.

Thai officials find themselves walking a tightrope. A failure to address the baht's strength could undermine attempts to attract investment.

One strategy has been to market the country as a trade war safe haven, luring international companies to relocate production to the kingdom. In September, Prayuth's government revealed a relocation package including tax incentives, special investment zones and investor-friendly legal reforms. But investing in Thailand could prove too costly if the baht stays strong or surges even higher.

On the other hand, the GSP issue also poses a threat to investment.

Although products shipped under the program account for less than 1% of total Thai exports, stripping Thailand of the privileges would still reduce its appeal with manufacturers as an alternative base to China.

Bangkok's attempt to ban the chemicals was akin to poking a tiger. ""While the overall sentiments for trade with the U.S. are dampening, I do not think it is Thailand's intention to 'fight a trade war with the U.S.,'"" Pavida said. ""But yes, Thailand stands at risk of being targeted under Trump's America First,"" she added.

Prayuth may have to contend with Trump's wrath for a while yet.","Tue, 17 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F9%252F4%252F0%252F3%252F23923049-1-eng-GB%252F20191217-AI_Thailand-US-Trade-War-img.png?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['row', 'ban', 'thailands', 'bangkok', 'trump', 'chemicals', 'thailand', 'thai', 'squeezes', 'billion', 'trade', 'farmers']",

In these countries and others, although the triggers for the protests, the methods and the goals are different, they share common themes – inequality, anger at the corruption of the elites, political unfreedoms and the consequences of climate change. In almost all cases, students and teachers were and remain on the frontlines of the massive demonstrations.



Most dramatically, with protests in Chile, although heavily repressed, it did not stop two million people from flooding the streets. Their collective proclamation is best captured by the words on a popular placard – ‘Neoliberalism was born in Chile and will die in Chile’.



The placard alludes to the fact that Chile after the military coup against Salvador Allende became the experimental grounds for Milton Friedman and the University of Chicago-trained economists, including the privatisation of social sectors such as education and healthcare.



Although the spark for the protests in Chile was an increase in the metro fare and the student-led movement of fare dodging, the protests rapidly expanded to other demands and embraced other social sectors. Chileans were clear: their demands transcended the 30 pesos of the transit increase, but quickly included fundamental societal change and an end to 30 years of neoliberalism.



Today Chile is one of the most unequal countries in Latin America, with low pensions, unequal education rights, the privatisation of water, a dire and inadequate healthcare system, a rise in electricity prices and a rigged constitution.



The Chilean protest movement took to the streets just days after the partial victory in Ecuador, led by indigenous communities against an International Monetary Fund-imposed structural adjustment programme.



Impressively, the protest movements in Chile and Ecuador consist of social forces dissatisfied with traditional political parties, comprising students, teachers, the unemployed, indigenous communities, trade unionists, feminists, environmentalists and those with precarious jobs. Moving away from narrow identity politics, they propose inclusive ‘transversal’ or non-sectoral demands incompatible with neoliberalism.



Neoliberalism on life support



The worldwide protests have prompted some supporters of an ‘enlightened’ capitalism, as they define it, to concede that neoliberalism is on life support.



Education generally, including universities, is certainly not immune from the impact of neoliberalism. Universities are confronted by renewed privatisation, intensive marketisation and a challenge to the very notion of the university as a mechanism for addressing social inequality and facilitating the circulation of knowledge.



The warnings of colleagues about ‘academic capitalism’ more than two decades ago (whereby academic staff are channelled into entrepreneurial ventures as part of the university’s income-generating ethic and the embedding of universities within the logic of capitalism) has become the norm globally.



It is true that struggles within higher education continue and sporadically flare up across different campuses and in different countries. These struggles include the demands for rethinking the purpose of formal education, universal access to free quality education, demands for institutional change and calls to decolonise institutions, programmes of study and curricula.



As labour precarity bites deeply across sectors and societies, in many countries, university workers – academic and non-academic – and students have organised to resist further cuts to education and social spending, the imposition of neoliberal governance models, reorientation of education along market lines and the suppression of dissent.



Yet, many of these struggles are short lived and often ineffective because of the inability to connect with struggles in broader society.



Undoubtedly, progressive spaces, while constrained, do exist and individuals in many universities are able to connect with community organisations and social movements and accomplish valuable counter-hegemonic work.



Often these spaces have been won through struggles and by pressure from organisations outside. They must be expanded through a vigorous defence of higher education as a public good and a sphere of critical democratic citizenry and resistance against commercial and corporate values that shape the form, purpose and mission of our institutions. Proactively, initiatives should include linking programmes, projects and resources to community needs and struggles.



During a recent panel discussion on social movements and education, Sangeeta Kamat, professor of international and comparative education at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the United States, articulated a challenge for those working in universities to build and sustain a ‘school to movement pipeline’.

World Food Program has warned that more than 4 million South Sudanese may slide into famine in the next six months unless the WFP receives funding to pre-position food aid.



WFP Executive Director David Beasley visited South Sudan this past week in the wake of floods that have destroyed crops, livestock and the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of South Sudanese. He pleaded with donors to help the nation's people.



""Please, we cannot turn our back on the innocent families and children out there,” Beasley told VOA's South Sudan in Focus. “Failure to raise the money we need within the crisis period could mean loss of lives, it could mean famine conditions, but let's hope we get the response we need to avert famine.""



Aid agencies say nearly 1 million people need assistance after floodwaters destroyed their animals, produce and much of their property.



Beasley warned that if the crisis was not addressed quickly, it could be a source of conflict within South Sudanese communities and cause a wave of immigration to other countries.

4.5 million in jeopardy



Matthew Hollingworth, the WFP country director in South Sudan, said 4.5 million people faced acute and emergency levels of food insecurity.



He said when people reach that point, they can slide into catastrophic food insecurity, which means a state of famine, which can quickly lead to many deaths.



Hollingworth said South Sudan was already at the worst level of malnutrition.



""We are already, from a nutrition perspective, above the emergency threshold for malnutrition in the world today, with 16 percent malnutrition in young children,” he told South Sudan in Focus. “Fifteen percent is the global emergency threshold. When you are above that, you have already crossed a red line.”



Hollingworth said WFP might be forced to scale down its operations if it does not secure the required funding in time.



In one severe local case, officials and residents in South Sudan's Boma state said more than 10,000 households in Jebel Boma County were facing severe hunger.

'Really suffering'

Resident Mary Medina said the hunger crisis started five months ago when floods hit the area. She said locals were surviving on wild vegetables collected from the bush, after heavy rains washed away all roads that enabled traders to import goods from neighboring states.



""We are really suffering here in our state,” Medina said. “We don't have access to roads, and also there is no network to connect us to other states. So we are just isolated here. Another problem is our markets are closed because there is nothing to be sold to the people for survival.""

Jebel Boma County resident Martha Kuram said children in particular were suffering.



""Our children are really starving,” she said. “We are just managing on a local vegetable called malkiring. We cook it for the children to eat every day. For those who would like to help, they should hurry up and rescue us, because if they don't, then I think people are going to perish in the near future.""

Jebel Boma County Commissioner Aliston Waskin said severe hunger in Boma state was widespread. Waskin said he had pleaded with national officials and humanitarian agencies to intervene, but that no single agency had responded.



Waskin said many people were at risk of dying.



""All these 58,000 are suffering. In fact, some of the people went to Ethiopia … and some of them came back,” Waskin said. “So those who are now present in Jebel Boma County in various places are facing this hunger.""","Fri, 20 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/reuters-pictures/2019/12/RTS2UMON.jpg,"['boma', 'south', 'state', 'million', 'children', 'wfp', 'warn', 'famine', 'county', 'sudan', 'officials', 'looming', 'waskin', 'food']",

Many farmers seeking relief from extended drought conditions have been compelled to turn to crowdfunding.

As for the wreckage wrought by the current bushfires, GoFundMe reported that by the end of November, more than 700 campaigns were launched in response.

Australia is now ranked third globally in donations per capita, with one in ten contributing to a GoFundMe campaign this year. Regional towns are the most generous donors, with Wagga Wagga, Mackay, and Launceston ranking highest.

What’s more, GoFundMe fundraisers specifically highlighting climate change increased by more than 65% in 2019.

And globally, on GoFundMe alone, crowdfunding campaigns have raised over US$9 billion from 120 million donations.

Between bushfires, devastating floods, and a drought with no end in sight, crowdfunding campaigns reflect a weary resolve amid the perceived inadequacy of government responses to natural disasters.

Read more: Crowdfunded campaigns are conserving the Earth's environment

Crowdfunding previously played only a relatively minor role in Australian life. But several recent campaigns illustrate the increasing influence crowdfunding might serve in forms of advocacy and activism.

Volunteer firefighting crews, stretched to their limits after weeks on the frontlines, have attempted to crowdfund equipment and supplies.

In fact, the most successful Australian GoFundMe campaign ever - raising $2 million from more than 45,000 donors - is for the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital, treating koalas injured during the fires.

But some close observers within charitable and philanthropic groups still advise donors to consider directing their contributions through registered charities.

One local brigade’s efforts to fundraise better protective masks were met with warnings from the rural fire service against establishing campaigns “without the appropriate authority”.

Not just advocacy, political activism too

Other campaigns in GoFundMe’s top ten most successful this year reveal that, at their best, such causes can simultaneously serve as direct advocacy for marginalized people and wider activism to address underlying injustice.

An immensely praiseworthy example – and the third most successful campaign this year – is “FreeHer”.

This campaign raises funds for Indigenous women in Western Australia imprisoned for inability to pay fines (such as Ms Dhu, who died in police custody after being held for unpaid fines).

Read more: Ms Dhu coronial findings show importance of teaching doctors and nurses about unconscious bias

The FreeHer campaign achieved immediate impact and sent a resounding message that such practices are wholly intolerable. The WA government subsequently repealed the laws.

Beyond this, there are now wider calls to address incarceration rates, particularly for Indigenous Australians, whom Aboriginal activist, academic and community leader Noel Pearson argued are “the most incarcerated people on the planet Earth”.

Other notable campaigns this year were even more directly political, something previously uncommon in Australia.

Among them were Senator Sarah Hanson-Young’s defamation case against David Leyonhjelm, the counter-campaign to “Fight the Greens”, and a few wholly unsuccessful efforts to re-elect hard right nationalist Fraser Anning.

In contrast, Anning’s arch-nemesis “Egg Boy” (Will Connolly) was far more successful – the eighth-highest fundraiser this year – with well-wishers raising substantial funds for Connolly’s legal fees.

When his expenses were covered pro bono Connolly donated the funds to victims of the Christchurch mosque shooting.

However, concerns have been raised that crowdfunding election campaigns could harm electoral integrity, largely due to the difficulty of tracing the source of donations.

Who gets a soapbox?

Conspicuously absent from GoFundMe’s list of most successful campaigns was one that might have otherwise finished on top.

Israel Folau’s campaign against his contract termination by Rugby Australia was undeniably contentious, raising debates around theological perspectives, employment law implications, or the contested functions of charitable institutions.

AAP Image/Joel Carrett

The campaign’s de-listing from GoFundMe – and rejection from the Australia-based MyCause platform – fed into narratives of Christians feeling “bullied”.

Why? Well, GoFundMe and MyCause are private companies, but to many they also represent the public square, presumably open to all. Such companies can act as gatekeepers, barring campaigns they believe may harm their reputation.

Perhaps the most infamous example was between 2014 and 2016, when GoFundMe banned campaigns directly raising money for an abortion. GoFundMe later relented, and have recently partnered with the ACLU and Planned Parenthood in support of reproductive rights.

Read more: Explainer: could the Australian Christian Lobby be investigated for its Israel Folau fundraiser?

The enthusiasm of the Australian Christian Lobby to host Folau’s campaign after it was de-listed – raising over A$2 million in two days – could also foretell a more ideologically-driven array of crowdfunding platforms. The furore may have even given the Morrison government an easier task in selling the Religious Discrimination Act.

Competing for attention in markets of sympathy

Crowdfunding can achieve wondrous outcomes, but less heartening is how often it’s needed to correct failures of the state, or suffering caused by private interests.

An obvious example is medical expenses, which easily comprises the most common type of campaign, despite the very low chances of success and threat of further harm.

Read more: As patients turn to medical crowdfunding, concerns emerge about privacy

It’s these heart-wrenching campaigns many pointed to when criticising Folau’s claim he was in “the fight of my life”.

Social crowdfunding platforms are effectively markets for sympathy, where “the crowd” weigh claims to moral worthiness. Such mechanisms create few winners and many losers. And suffering can be compounded in witnessing how much one’s life is worth in the eyes of others.

Crowdfunding is a popular tool of recognition and redistribution, promising new ways to govern ourselves and determine what values we hold.

But we must ensure it doesn’t become an altar of “sacrificial citizenship”, where good people falling on hard times must prove they are uniquely deserving above all others.

A small group of the extinct humanoid species made its last stand on the island of Java in Indonesia about 110,000 years ago, according to new research.

An international team of researchers led by the University of Iowa have been studying an area around the village of Ngangdong on the island.

The experts now believe Homo erectus, which walked upright like us, was the first ancient human to leave Africa and maybe the first to have cooked, was wiped out by climate change.

Global heating parched the grassland where they lived and destroyed its food supply of deer and cattle.

EXPLAINED: HOMO ERECTUS EVOLVED 1.9 MILLION YEARS AGO IN AFRICA AND WAS A 'GLOBAL TRAVELLER' First thought to have evolved around 1.9 million years ago in Africa, Homo erectus was the first early human species to become a true global traveller. They are known to have migrated from Africa into Eurasia, spreading as far as Georgia, Sri Lanka, China and Indonesia. They ranged in size from just under five feet tall to over six feet. With a smaller brain and heavier brow than modern humans, they are thought to have been a key evolutionary step in our evolution. It was previously thought Homo erectus disappeared some 400,000 years ago. However, this date has been dramatically reduced, with more recent estimates suggesting they went extinct just 140,000 years ago. They are thought to have given rise to a number of different extinct human species including Homo heidelbergensis and Homo antecessor. Homo erectus is thought to have lived in hunter gatherer societies and there is some evidence that suggests they used fire and made basic stone tools. Advertisement

Experts unearthed their last known settlement on the Solo River, just outside the village of Ngangdong in the centre of the Indonesian island.

'The fossils are part of a mass death event that occurred upriver, which coincided with changing environmental conditions as open woodlands transitioned to a rainforest', said Professor Russell Ciochon, co-lead author.

The groundbreaking discovery also confirms Homo erectus as the most long-lived human species - thriving for nearly two million years.

Homo sapiens - modern humans - emerged just a quarter of a million years ago.

'This site is the last known appearance of Homo erectus found anywhere in the world', said Professor Ciochon.

'We can't say we dated the extinction, but we dated the last occurrence of it. We have no evidence Homo erectus lived later than that anywhere else.'

Archaeological records show that Homo erectus spread across Asia over an area ranging from Turkey to China after moving out of Africa.

They were slightly bigger and more powerful than Homo sapiens, but their brains were not as evolved, according to researchers.

Around 400,000 years ago, they essentially vanished. But their final resting place has now been identified - and it is only 108,000 to 117,000 years old.

The international team mainly from the USA and Australia 'time-stamped' the site by analysing fossilised animal remains from a prehistoric graveyard.

The graveyard had contained 12 Homo erectus skull caps and two shinbones that were dug up by a Dutch expedition in 1930.

Until now they had been difficult to date - with experts estimating they could have been up to 550,000 years old.

River terraces surrounding the village were dated to establish an accurate record for the primeval humans' remote refuge.

'You have this incredible array of dates that are all consistent', said Professor Ciochon from the University of Iowa.

'This has to be the right range. That's why it's such a nice, tight paper. The dating is very consistent.'

He added: 'The findings help to clarify the position of this early hominin species in the evolution of humans from this region of the world.'

The study published in Nature also worked out when mountains south of Ngandong first rose by dating stalagmites from caves.

'The issues with the dating of Ngandong could only ever be resolved by an appreciation of the wider landscape', said Kira Westaway, of Macquarie University.

'Fossils are the by products of complex landscape processes.

'We were able to nail the age of the site because we constrained the fossils within the river deposit, the river terrace, the sequence of terraces and the volcanically active landscape.'

Previous studies have revealed Homo erectus hopscotched its way across the Indonesian archipelago - arriving on Java about 1.6 million years ago.

The timing was good. The area around Ngandong was mostly grassland with plenty of plants and animals - just like their cradle in Africa.

The continued to venture to other islands but Java likely remained home - or at least a way station - to some bands.

Around 130,000 years ago the environment at Ngandong changed - and so did Homo erectus' fortunes.

'We know the fauna changed from open country, grassland, to a tropical rainforest - extending southward from today's Malaysia', said Professor Ciochon.

'Those were not the plants and animals that Homo erectus was used to, and the species just could not adapt.'

Since 2008 his 12 member team has carried out two excavations, using notes from the Dutch surveyors' dig almost 90 years earlier.

They found the original Homo erectus bone bed at Ngandong and re-exposed it, collecting and dating 867 animal fossil fragments.

At the same time Professor Westaway's team were investigating the landscapes., something described as 'coincidental' by Professor Ciochon.

'With the data we had, we couldn't really date the Ngandong fossils', he said.

'We had dates on them, but they were minimum ages. So, we couldn't really say how old, although we knew we were in the ballpark.'

'By working with Professor Westaway, who had vast amount of dating data for the terraces, mountains and other landscape features, we were able to provide precise regional chronological and geomorphic contexts for the Ngandong site.'

The research has been published in the journal Nature.","Wed, 18 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/12/18/18/22413548-0-image-a-2_1576692770763.jpg,"['village', 'thought', '108000', 'erectus', 'homo', 'ngandong', 'professor', 'living', 'species', 'river', 'earlier', 'humans', 'indonesia', 'ago']",

U.S. Coast Guardsmen paused on Monday to honor and remember the crew and passengers lost in the crash of a rescue helicopter during the historic December 1964 storms that struck Northern California.

The Coast Guard Air Station San Francisco HH-52 helicopter crew members Lt. Cmdr. Donald Prince, Petty Officer 2nd Class James Nininger, Jr., and Royal Canadian Navy Sub-Lt. Allen Alltree, along with a civilian volunteer spotter and three people they had rescued from flood waters, were remembered during the memorial service.

On December 22, 1964, the helicopter crew was dispatched to assist in rescue efforts near Humboldt Bay during a severe storm. At 2:48 p.m., the helicopter arrived in the Humboldt Bay area where a local resident, Bud Hansen, volunteered to board the helicopter to help spot flood survivors and orient the crew to local landmarks. The helicopter crew rescued 10 people from roof tops and flooded areas throughout the day.

Later that evening as weather conditions worsened, Arcata Airport Flight Service Station received a radio call from the helicopter crew reporting they were trying to land with three rescued people aboard. Due to a loss of power at the airport, there was no instrument navigation aids or radar guidance to help guide the aircraft in the low visibility conditions.

Flight service station instruments indicated that the helicopter was northwest of the airport and the flight service controller continued to radio the pilot directions in hopes of guiding them to a safe landing. A short time later, a citizen who lived 12 miles north of the airport reported seeing a helicopter about one mile off shore heading south. The flight service station repeatedly attempted to relay the report to the pilot but was met with silence.

The following morning, a search team comprised of two Coast Guard aircraft crews and Humboldt County Sheriff’s deputies began searching for the missing aircraft. Over the next few days, a ground party consisting of 200 people including Navy personnel, Georgia-Pacific employees and other California military reservists, searched the forests during dangerous weather conditions without success.

Three days after losing contact with the aircrew, a Navy helicopter from the USS Bennington located the wreckage of the helicopter, tail number CG 1363, and directed ground parties to the crash located on a slope at 1,130 of feet elevation nine miles north of the Arcata Airport near a landmark known today as Strawberry Rock. Located with the wreckage were the three crewmen, Hansen and two women and an infant girl who had been previously rescued before the crash.

Coast Guardsmen at Sector Humboldt Bay maintain a tight bond with their local community. Every December, they hold a memorial service for all who lost their lives on that tragic day.","Wed, 18 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Wreckage_Salvage/helicopter-1363-crashed.56675f.jpg,"['holds', 'service', 'crew', 'humboldt', 'crash', 'victims', 'navy', 'coast', 'helicopter', 'guard', 'rescued', 'station', 'airport', 'memorial']", 
79,79,FL-2019-000181-IDN,7 ways climate change was felt in Asia in 2019 | News - Eco-Business,https://www.eco-business.com/news/7-ways-climate-change-was-felt-in-asia-in-2019/,"Blistering heatwaves hot enough to melt tarmac, crippling water shortages that upended economies, torrential rains that swept away homes and catastrophic storms that left settlements in ruins.

As countries, desperate to protect their economies, continue to drag their feet on climate action, such calamities have become a reality facing many across the world’s most populous continent.

Asia may be the region most vulnerable to climate change, but the myriad of environmental and social ills communities across the disaster-prone continent grapple with, ranging from rivers clogged with waste to runaway development, exacerbate the impacts of a changing climate.

And as the globe warms, it is those lacking the resources to cope who suffer the most. Climate refugees, long a term only found in climate change reports, are now on the move, fleeing droughts, heat and rising seas.

Here are some of the climate disasters that ravaged Asia this year.

1. India and Pakistan baked in a heatwave

With temperatures hot enough to melt roads, a record-breaking heatwave swept across Pakistan and India from May to June this year, upending the lives of millions across the Indian subcontinent.

Jacobabad in Pakistan saw a temperature of 51 degrees Celsius, making it the hottest place on earth. In India, the highest temperature occurred in the northern state of Rajasthan, reaching a blistering 50.8°C.

For many, the heatwave turned deadly. In India, it claimed more than 184 lives in the eastern state of Bihar alone, with many more reported dead in other parts of the region.

With this year’s monsoon rains delayed, the heatwave was the second-longest ever recorded in the region, exacerbating water-scarce conditions across South Asia.

Heatwaves have become more extreme and frequent, but as the world warms, stifling heat is set to become an even bigger problem, according to a 2018 study published in Nature. By 2100, three out of four people on earth could be subject to at least 20 days of heat per year if climate change remains unchecked, the study found.

The issue is particularly acute in megacities, where searing heat, aggravated by dense concrete structures, mingles with toxic air pollution, putting the lives of urban dwellers at risk. Worsening urban heat, experts predict, will lead to a global healthcare crisis that will cost cities billions worldwide.

2. Chennai was hit by a water crisis

When no rain fell in Chennai for 193 days, life changed for the city’s 10 million residents as water scarcity, and the crippling uncertainty, exhaustion and despair it entails, became a new daily reality.

The drought caused Chennai’s water supply, already strained due to last year’s fickle monsoon rains and the city’s burgeoning population, to hit rock bottom.

To quench residents’ thirst, Chennai dispatched tankers to source water on its outskirts and supply its drought-stricken neighbourhoods. But at the height of the crisis, demand was rarely met, making it hard for residents to cook, wash or keep businesses afloat.

Chennai’s vulnerable communities, and especially women and children, were hit the hardest. Lacking the resources to cope, they were forced to spend hours waiting to get their water pots filled, putting them at risk of sleep deprivation, sickness and diminished opportunities.

The fatal heatwave that swept across India and Pakistan from May to June exacerbated the crisis, with temperatures in Chennai rising to 42°C. Maximum average temperatures in the city are also higher than ever, increasing the demand for water.

Water scarcity is a fate facing many communities across the Indian subcontinent. In many regions, drought has forced people, particularly farmers, to uproot themselves in search of somewhere else to live, transforming once-lush paddy fields into abandoned farmland scarred by dried riverbeds.

As the climate changes, urban water crises like Chennai’s are expected to become a nationwide problem in India. According to a 2018 study by Indian government thinktank Niti Aayog, 21 Indian cities will run out of groundwater by 2020.

3. Torrential rains lashed Bangladesh, Nepal, India and Pakistan

Catastrophic monsoon rains battered much of South Asia this year, flooding thousands of villages and displacing millions.

Rivers swelled to dangerous levels literally overnight, eventually bursting their banks. With roads, bridges and railways damaged by the floods, many areas became inaccessible, leaving communities in need of clean water, food and other supplies cut off.

As houses were swept away by the deluge or buried under landslides, millions fled their homes to seek refuge in relief camps.

Hundreds went missing; dozens were reported dead.

Monsoon-triggered floods befall the region every year. The monsoon season normally occurs from June to September, when southwest winds pick up moisture from the Indian Ocean and drop it as rain on land.

But climate change is disturbing this seasonal cycle. The rains, which the agriculture-reliant region needs for its survival, now often fail, or are extremely intense.

According to the India Meteorological Department, this year’s monsoon season in India arrived late, saw the highest amount of rain in more than 25 years and was the latest to withdraw in recorded history.

The heavy downpours came a year after India’s southern state Kerala was hit by its worst floods in nearly a century.

4. The mighty Mekong teetered on the brink of collapse

Southeast Asia’s largest river is facing unprecedented pressures, setting up the six countries, and 60 million people dependent on the river’s churning waters for their livelihoods, for potential disaster.

Due to a combination of proliferating hydropower construction and intense dry weather, the Mekong, which stretches for some 4,500 kilometres from its source in the Tibetan highlands through Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia before emptying into the South China Sea in Vietnam, was at its lowest in a century this year, threatening food supply.

The monsoon rains—critical for the agriculture-dependent region’s survival—arrived late, with dry conditions lasting well into July. This made it impossible for many rice farmers across the region to plant their main crop.

As the drought persisted, dam operators upstream withheld water for their own purposes, further diminishing water flow.

Hydropower along the Mekong is growing faster than anywhere else in the world. This is expected to have devastating consequences for fish reproduction in the river basin, which is the largest inland fishery globally.

Also affected is Cambodia’s Tonle Sap lake—the largest freshwater lake in the region—which relies on the Mekong’s annual monsoon-triggered flood pulse and the sediment it brings to keep its fish stocks alive. Fish from the lake represents 70 per cent of the country’s protein intake.

Droughts and disruptions to the Mekong’s water flow are set to become more common, experts warn, saying that this could eventually cause the entire ecosystem to collapse.

This year’s dry conditions persisted due to the El Niño phenomenon—a part of a routine climate pattern that causes high air pressure in the western Pacific, leading to drier-than-average rainfall conditions in Southeast Asia. As the globe warms, the impacts of this phenomenon are becoming more severe, researchers say. There is also evidence that climate change is shortening the monsoon season considerably.

Another disaster is unfolding in the Mekong Delta, where rapid urbanisation, sand mining and excessive groundwater exploitation cause the land to sink, while climate change causes the sea to rise. As seawater pushes steadily inland, it threatens to destroy homes, contaminates aquifers, and renders once arable soil infertile.

Due to the acceleration in large-scale dam construction, sediment load the river once brought down to the delta—Vietnam’s rice bowl, which is vital to the nation’s food supply— is now greatly reduced.

As a result, most of southern Vietnam, including the Mekong Delta and the nation’s economic hub, Ho Chi Minh City, could be frequently flooded as early as 2050, experts warn. Within a century, the delta might disappear completely.

5. Rising seas engulfed Indonesia’s coastline

These days, many coastal dwellers across the Indonesian archipelago watch in horror as the water edges closer to their homes.

Rising seas are among the biggest climate threats facing Indonesia, with thousands of its low-lying islands at risk of being inundated by 2050. But nowhere in Indonesia is the threat as acute as in Jakarta, the country’s capital and economic powerhouse.

In the traffic-clogged megacity of 10 million, the impacts of climate change are exacerbated by various man-made ills, ranging from runaway development to excessive and unregulated groundwater extraction.

The expansion of its concrete jungle and draining of aquifers causes Jakarta to sink faster than any other city, faster, even, than the melting of polar ice causes the seas to rise. Today, almost half of Jakarta is already below sea level.

With attempts to save the city having failed thus far, the Indonesian government announced plans this year to relocate the capital to the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo, stoking fears that the move would destroy Kalimantan’s pristine forests and peatlands, and could derail Indonesia’s climate targets.

Indonesia is not the only country that is vulnerable to rising sea levels. From Mumbai and Bangladesh to Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City, encroaching seawater threatens to swallow coastal populations.

6. Indonesia’s forests were ablaze

With an El Niño pattern causing the dry season to be harsher than usual, fires, started mainly by farmers clearing land, were raging in Indonesia’s rainforests once again this year, sending billows of toxic smoke into Malaysia and Singapore, four years after Indonesia’s worst haze crisis on record.

The catastrophic fires, which laid waste to an area several times the size of Singapore, claimed at least two lives, but the hazardous haze that blanketed Indonesia for months has also caused long-term damage to human lives, leading to reduced child survival rates, respiratory diseases and other health impacts, experts say.

Researchers say that global warming has exacerbated the impacts of recent El Niño events, causing temperatures to rise and droughts to last longer. This increases the risk of forest fires like the ones in Indonesia, Australia and the United States.

Indonesia’s forest fires released more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than the blazes in the Amazon this year, according to the European Union’s atmosphere observation programme.

7. Powerful storms slammed into the Philippines

20 typhoons hit the Philippines this year. The latest storm, Typhoon Kammuri, ripped through the country on 3 December, bringing heavy rains and gale-force winds.

The typhoon, which caused the country to cancel some plans for this year’s Southeast Asian Games, claimed at least 17 lives and led to close to half-a-million people seeking refuge in evacuation centres.

Typhoons leaving trails of destruction across the Philippines make headlines every year, but these giant storms have grown 50 per cent stronger in the past 40 years due to warming seas, researchers have found. And as the climate changes, things will get worse.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global warming is set to increase the frequency of El Niño weather events in the Pacific, which cause surface waters to warm up. This, in turn, will intensify tropical storms and rainfall.

Cigarette smuggling is booming, with Customs warning that organised crime syndicates are now muscling in because of the huge profits to be made.

The high cost of a packet of cigarettes here, and the relatively low cost in nearby Asian countries makes New Zealand a prime target.

David White/Stuff This Korean man was selling cigarettes for cash on the street in Auckland CBD.

While ethnic Chinese and Korean groups have driven the trade, Customs' lead investigator says trans-national crime gangs and local gangs are now running cigarette smuggling in parallel with their usual drug operations.

We were easily able to set up two street meetings with young Korean men who had advertised on the Korean social media platform Kakao Talk, offering to sell imported cigarettes by the carton for cash.

David White/Stuff The man declined to give his name, or where he was sourcing the cigarettes from.

Their cartons would cost just $175 - or $17.50 a pack, against a typical shop price of $31 - and they indicated no limit on how many we could buy.

Our first seller was happy to meet outside a Denny's restaurant in downtown Auckland. The backseat of his station wagon was littered with cigarette cartons, and he had five cartons of Korean-branded Marlboros ready to sell.

When we confronted the man as he prepared to complete the transaction, he said he was paying cash for the cigarettes from another Korean he contacted via Kakao Talk, and insisted he would pay GST on the transactions. He said he was paying less than $175 a carton for his supply, but wouldn't say how much, or give his own name or the name of his supplier. He said it was his 34th such street sale and he was a New Zealand citizen on a sickness benefit.

David White/Stuff This man met our contact to sell him cigarettes but said afterwards they were a gift for a relative.

Asked how he knew the cigarettes were being brought in legally, he said: ""I have no idea. I buy them in New Zealand."" Asked if he knew what he was doing was likely to be illegal, he said: ""Oh really. Oh sorry. I am not doing this again.""

Yet minutes later, we watched as a young woman approached the man to purchase cigarettes. And within half an hour, he was again sending messages offering to complete the original trade we had interrupted. Days later, he was offering to sell 100 cartons in one exchange.

Our second seller met outside a Korean dairy near the waterfront, with 10 packets of cigarettes bundled in a plastic bag for sale. When approached, he walked away quickly, saying that the cigarettes were a gift he had brought from overseas for his ""relative"" (our contact). He'd told our source he was here on a working holiday visa from Korea.

DAVID WHITE/STUFF Customs' head of investigations, Bruce Berry, says the illegal cigarette market is rapidly expanding.

Like the first man, he was prepared to meet again, but said he couldn't complete the sale because it was too risky and he would have to meet potential purchasers would have to meet outside the CBD.

A third seller arranged to meet outside a cafe on High St, but failed to turn up.

Kakao Talk is littered with advertisements from people willing to sell cigarettes to members of a 2600-strong forum for Koreans living in New Zealand.

David White/Stuff Bags of cigarettes on the backseat of a man who was selling them on the street in Auckland.

Bruce Berry, Customs' national investigations manager, wasn't surprised. He said Chinese and Korean communities were the main source of the illicit trade, and much of it was conducted almost openly on social media. Customs were battling against a community belief that cigarette smuggling was not a serious offence.

Berry said the price of cigarettes was now high enough that the profit margin for smugglers was appealing enough to attract organised crime.

""It's been a consistent message from Customs for a while now that we'll see an increase in this [smuggling] as we reach that tipping point,"" he said. ""We are well past it now, and it [tobacco] is a viable commodity in its own right. Organised crime are just in it for the money, they are not interested in what harm this is doing to our community: it's just the same thing as drugs.""

supplied/NZ Customs Recent hauls of smuggled cigarettes intercepted by NZ Customs

Berry said trans-national organised groups had seen the opportunity and it was ""only a matter of time before domestic organised crime factions see the money to be made; if they are not already.""

Groups who had imported drugs were now importing cigarettes in tandem; one key Customs target had also being prosecuted for importing methamphetamine and MDMA.

Customs' biggest inquiry, Operation Whitethorn, reaches its culmination on Monday when a man Customs believe was at the centre of a major smuggling ring will enter a plea at the Auckland District Court.

David White/Stuff Bruce Berry in his Auckland office: ""We are having an impact.""

Customs seized 1.8m cigarettes and around $2m cash and also restrained multiple properties, luxury cars and bank accounts.

Berry says a conservative estimate of the amount of tax and duty avoided by those involved in Whitethorn would be $16-20m.

In another recent case, a mother and son were arrested and charged over what Customs believe was a smuggling ring bringing in tobacco from the Cook Islands; 79.6kg was seized and Customs said $113,422 in duties and GST had been evaded.

supplied/NZ Customs Recent hauls of smuggled cigarettes intercepted by NZ Customs

Berry said 95 per cent of his fraud unit's time had been spent this year investigating cigarette smuggling. They have six more major prosecutions of smuggling syndicates ready to go in 2020 and say they have identified three more major wholesalers they are preparing cases against.

Whitethorn began because of a Crimestoppers' tip-off about a low-level seller, but Customs worked up the chain to charge the two main offenders and Berry said their approach was to target the ringleaders and so cause the biggest disruption to supplies.

Customs officers had seen cigarettes stitched into clothing, or 'bodypacked', where the cigarettes are strapped to the torso. Larger consignments had been concealed in shipping containers or mailed to PO Boxes with false declarations. One group caught using multiple PO Boxes for mis-declared packages simply began paying the excise instead - using skimmed credit cards. Tour group organisers had been deported for instructing their tourists to each bring in their personal duty-free allowance (50 cigarettes or 50g of tobacco), then regathering it to re-sell.

In the 2018-2019 financial year, Customs intercepted 614kg of loose tobacco and 4.5m cigarettes at the border - which would equate to $10.8m in lost excise. In the first four months of the 2019-2020 financial year - July to October - Customs intercepted another 143kg of loose tobacco and 3.1m cigarettes. New Zealand First recently claimed interceptions at the border had risen 352 per cent between 2015 and 2019.

""In one hour in November, we seized over 100,000 cigarettes at the International Mail Centre: that's the scale of what we're dealing with,"" Berry said.

The tobacco industry itself estimates 10.2 per cent of the New Zealand cigarette market is now illicitly-traded. A report commissioned by KPMG estimated that of that illicit trade, 82.3 per cent of it was in contraband and suggested lost Customs revenue was $224m.

A ten per cent increase in excise duty every year since 2011 has driven New Zealand prices to the second-highest in the South-east Asia/Pacific region, behind only Australia. An average pack might cost $31 in New Zealand, but just $1.62 in Vietnam, $5.29 in China and $6.07 in Korea.

A tobacco industry source said the major companies typically made just a few per cent profit on each cigarette, with three-quarters of the sale price going to the government: ""So if you can cut 75 per cent out of your costs, then it can become very lucrative."" Each individual cigarette is worth about $1 to the government.

Earlier this month, NZ First said they planned to oppose this year's excise rise, partly because of the impact it had on smuggling, with leader Winston Peters saying organised crime had seen an ""economic opportunity"" which had placed ""unnecessary pressure"" on customs, diverting it from the drugs trade.

The biggest cigarette company, Phillip Morris, declined to comment.

In a statement, their biggest rival, British American Tobacco, advocated for the government to bring in new laws and regulations to crack down on smugglers.

BAT's suggestions include increasing sentences so they match those for drug importation; introducing importer's and grower's licences; introducing tobacco-detection dogs at ports of entry and the International Mail Centre, and reviewing or removing the existing personal allowance for homegrown tobacco.

Those homegrown limits are often used as a loophole for New Zealand's other big illicit tobacco problem: 'chop chop', or loose-leaf tobacco. While some of this is imported, much is grown illicitly domestically, even on industrial levels and sold surreptitiously at dairies or markets.

The industry source said the big companies were worried and employed their own private investigators to check out leads and pass information to Customs.

""We take it very seriously,"" said the source. ""We probably feel that they are not doing enough - but I think that's what you get when you deal with any regulator, they don't have enough resource to combat it. I don't think the government believes how big it is - but once you start crunching the numbers it could be billions of lost money in excise and duty.""

The industry says counterfeit cigarettes are only 0.2 per cent of the illicit trade at present, but Berry predicted that counterfeits would become a growing problem.

The source said illicit factories in Indonesia could turn out ""bloody good"" counterfeits, and their work had become easier since plain-packaging regulations were imposed, meaning the government published clear regulations around pack size, the size and wording of health warnings, and even the required colours, fonts and pantones to be used. That left only the unique identifiers on the packs and cigarettes to identify them as fake.

The maximum sentence for offences relating to cigarette importation is five years' imprisonment, making it a less risky proposition than the drug trade. One source said: ""You can make as much money as you would from drugs, and you won't go to prison.""

81,81,FL-2019-000181-IDN,East Africa's abnormal rainfall - Independent,https://www.independent.co.ug/east-africas-abnormal-rainfall/,"Meteorologists warn of more rains in coming weeks

Kampala, Uganda | RONALD MUSOKE | Thousands of people continue to be displaced in eastern and western Uganda due to heavy rains that are also wreaking havoc across the East African region.

More than 30 people in Uganda have died in the past two weeks as result of flooding and landslides and the government says tens of thousands of people have been displaced from their homes.

Weather experts say the rains have been enhanced by a phenomenon known as the Indian Ocean Dipole and it appears there will be no let-off in the coming weeks. The term ‘Indian Ocean Dipole’ refers to the difference in sea surface temperature between the western and eastern poles of the ocean.

Godfrey Mujuni, the Manager Data Centre at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA) told The Independent on Dec. 09 that the Indian Ocean stretches from the East African Coast (western part of the ocean) to the eastern side (Australia and Indonesia).

And, occasionally, either pole or region of the ocean goes through periodic warming bringing with it what meteorologists call the positive Indian Ocean Dipole. A positive Dipole is said to cause a rise in water temperatures in the ocean by up to 2°C leading to an increase in water vapour in the atmosphere that later falls as rain.

“A positive IOD (in the western portion of the ocean) normally favours the whole East African hinterland bringing a lot of rain and when it does not favour the region, it causes drought conditions,” Mujuni says.

Mujuni explains that it is this event that has caused ‘above normal’ rains throughout eastern Africa including Uganda since October this year. Ethiopia, northern and southern parts of Somalia, eastern South Sudan, central and northeastern Kenya, and parts of northwestern and eastern Tanzania have also been affected.

The rains have also caused several rivers to flood blocking major highways and other important roads. Early this month, the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) issued a travel advisory to people travelling to the northwestern region of West Nile to use alternative routes when the River Nile burst its banks cutting off the road at Pakwach. The road connects Uganda to South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The rains have caused destructive flooding in several low-lying areas and landslides in the mountainous regions of Bundibugyo in the West and the Bududa areas in the eastern region. Bundibugyo has so far registered over 20 deaths following devastating landslides on Dec. 07.

Diana Tumuhimbise, the Red Cross branch manager for Rwenzori region said the humanitarian agency had on Dec. 08 recovered 12 bodies from the deluge while one person was rushed to hospital with serious injuries. However, the humanitarian agency later updated its fatality count to 22 on Dec.09.

“Our team continues to recover more bodies including some that are trapped by cocoa trees in the Bundibugyo hills. It is a very devastating moment,” the Red Cross said, adding that other affected areas include; Bulambuli, Butaleja, Manafwa, Namisindwa, Mbale, Sironko, Amuru, Kasese, Nakapiripirit and Otuke Districts.

Musa Ecweru, the Minister of State for Disaster Preparedness said a swift assessment conducted by the government in the most affected mountainous districts of Bududa, Sironko, Manafwa, Namisindwa and Mbale has placed the number of displaced persons at 25,000 while some 85,000 households were affected and 21,500 hectares of crop and plantation damaged.

Still, in the low-lying eastern Uganda regions of Teso and Bukedi, at least 55,000 people have been displaced and over 120,000 hectares of crop destroyed by floods. The northern part of the country has also suffered losses of crop and home destruction due to flooding.

This period of the year is supposed to be the “rainy season” in Uganda and much of East Africa, according to weather experts, but the rains which are falling this year have been described as ‘above average.’

The rains have also left devastation in several countries in the region with close to one million South Sudanese affected, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Central African Republic has seen more than 100,000 affected, Burundi (3,800 with 2 deaths), Democratic Republic of Congo (200,000 with 40 deaths), Tanzania (1,100, 44 deaths) and Kenya (160,000, 125 deaths).

Somalia has seen more than 547,000 people affected with 17 people dead, Ethiopia (570,000, 23 deaths), Djibouti (150,000, 9 deaths) and Sudan (426,000). The experts say the current rainfall season is expected to be one of the wettest on record since the 1980s.

Ecweru said the government had released Shs 20bn (US$5.5 million) under the life saving and rescue phase to address the landslides situation in the mountainous and in flooding areas.

The minister said the funds will be used for procurement of relief food, tarpaulins, and blankets, drugs for water borne diseases, inflatable boats and culverts for fixing washed away bridges.","Mon, 16 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.independent.co.ug/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/rain_.jpg,"['landslides', 'region', 'ocean', 'africas', 'abnormal', 'eastern', 'rainfall', 'indian', 'rains', 'east', 'deaths', 'western', 'uganda', 'affected']",

The European Commission is considering removing coking coal from a list of critical raw materials. The steel industry, already facing difficulty importing the raw materials it needs, says this could spell disaster.

Europe’s steel industry is facing critical headwinds. Trade tensions between the EU and the Trump administration in the United States have put the sector in a world of uncertainty.

And a new, more obscure threat may be looming around the corner – a loss of raw materials critical to the production of steel.

Donald Trump’s decision to slap 25% tariffs on foreign steel last year has already hobbled European steelmakers, who are struggling with a glut of steel they can no longer export.

The European Commission has put in place “safeguard” measures to stop the glut by limiting incoming steel that is being diverted from the US market. But the steel industry says it has not been effective.

Lakshmi Mittal, CEO if steelmaker ArcelorMittal, told the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung earlier this year that there are around 500 to 550 million tonnes of overcapacity in the steel industry – a quarter of global steel production.

According to Mittal, this shows the EU measures aren’t working. “Further measures are urgently necessary given the import tariffs US President Donald Trump has imposed on steel imports to the United States,” he said.

“The EU’s safeguard clauses have gaps – it’s too easy for exporters to evade them and the impact is massive: we have a steel glut.”

The problem, the European steel industry says, is that much of the overcapacity is the result of state subsidies in Asian economies. Those subsidies can come in curious forms. For instance, the EU believes Indonesia is giving its steel imports into Europe an unfair advantage by restricting the export of the raw materials used to make steel.

Nickel competition

Nickel ore, used in the production of stainless steel, has also come into focus. Indonesia has massively increased its production of stainless steel in recent years, taking advantage of the fact that it mines about a quarter of the nickel ore in the world.

The situation has become so serious that last month the European Commission launched a complaint against Indonesia.

“EU steel producers are under a lot of pressure and are suffering from the consequences of global overcapacity and unilateral trade restrictions,” said Cecilia Malmström, EU trade commissioner at the time.

“The export restrictions imposed by Indonesia put further jobs in the EU’s steel industry at risk,” she said.

The European steel industry says Indonesia is using the nickel export restrictions to undercut them. “Indonesia is sitting on vast quantities of nickel, they’ve set up an entirely export-oriented stainless steel industry,” says Aurelio Braconi, senior raw materials manager at European steel industry association Eurofer.

He says the Indonesian steel is flooding into the European market at cut-throat prices because of the country’s access to nickel. The situation shows just how critical raw materials can be.

“We have a double exposure,” he explains. “We don’t have enough resources in Europe and we don’t have the possibility to compete.”

Indonesian stainless steel exports have gone from almost nothing two years ago to becoming the second largest exporter worldwide and the largest to the EU. All the while, it is implementing strict control over the export of nickel ore, making it harder for other countries to produce stainless steel.

The country’s capacity is expected to expand to more than 11 million tonnes by 2025, even though its internal market demand was estimated at just 200,000 tonnes in 2018.

The Commission’s safeguard exercise is monitoring the situation on the steel market. But at the time it was launched two years ago, Indonesia wasn’t exporting stainless steel, so the country hasn’t been included.

“The market conditions changed so fast, so every instrument set up by policymakers should be adapted to have an update when needed for raw materials,” says Braconi.

Coking concerns

Nickel ore isn’t the only raw material the European steel industry is struggling to procure. Coking coal, which is used to produce steel in an oxygen furnace, is also mostly imported. This specific type of coal is a very small proportion of the overall coal that is mined. But it’s essential to the steel-making process.

Because it is both so essential and so scarce in Europe, the European Commission has placed it on a list of “critical raw materials”. But in 2017, the Commission moved it to a list of “borderline” materials that may be removed at a later stage.

Now, the steel industry worries it could be removed altogether when the list is updated in March next year. “Coking coal for the steel industry in the short term is still a critical material,” says Braconi. “Maybe in the next 10 to 15 years there could be new technologies to replace it, but for now we need it.”

Poland is the only place in Europe that is mining coking coal in any significant capacity, although there is also a small mine in the Czech Republic. The vast majority is imported from elsewhere in the world. And with trade tensions and economic trends threatening raw materials supply, a sudden shift in the import situation could mean steel is no longer available for European construction.

Europe waking up to raw materials ‘criticality’ Access to critical raw materials used in digital and clean technologies was labelled as “a strategic security question” in a European Green Deal unveiled today (11 December). A new industrial policy is expected to complete the picture next year.

Already, the industry says there has been a decoupling of raw material market dynamics from supply and demand. “Previously raw materials would fall with falling demand,” says Braconi. “In recent months we’ve seen prices of steel collapse even as raw materials prices remain high.”

China is the largest producer of coking coal, accounting for more than half of global supply. Australia produces 15%, and Russia and the United States 7% each. EU production of coking coal accounts for just 1% of world production. Most EU imports of coking coal come from Australia, Russia and the United States.

JSW, a Polish company mining the material, is urging the Commission not to remove coking coal from the list.

“Taking into account the growing demand for steel, the demand for coking coal will increase significantly,” the company says. “Bearing in mind the significant CO2 emissions from coking coal imported from distant countries, it should be crucial to secure a stable, reliable domestic production meeting the European environmental standards.”

“We strongly urge the European Commission to maintain coking coal on the critical raw materials list.”

As the steel industry faces multiple headwinds, the sector is hoping that these issues will be addressed in the industrial strategy to be adopted in March. That strategy is expected to revise the critical raw materials policy. The result of that revision could have a significant impact on European steel.","Fri, 13 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/Coal_China-800x450.jpg,"['keeping', 'coal', 'steel', 'european', 'commission', 'nickel', 'coke', 'critical', 'industry', 'night', 'eu', 'materials', 'coking', 'raw']",

The Dec. 3 mishap happened when the ship was underway near its San Diego homeport, according to Navy officials.

Sailors discovered the flooding, secured the main and dewatered the space, Naval Surfaces Forces spokesman Cmdr. Patrick Evans said.

Citing the ongoing investigation into the cause of the incident and the extent of the damage, Evans declined additional comment.

The mishap didn’t affect the warship’s ability to continue on its present mission, according to command spokeswoman Lt. Cmdr. Patricia Kreuzberger.

Sailors injured battling blaze on warship The fire erupted Thursday night in the cargo hold, officials said.

The Navy has categorized the incident as a “Class A” mishap, which involves damages totaling at least $2.5 million.

It happened a day after the Essex returned to sea following eight months of maintenance, according to the command’s official Facebook page.

The two extra Nozomi trains will run on the Tokaido Shinkansen line during such times as Friday evenings and long holidays, according to an announcement Friday.

JR Central unveiled a new Nozomi timetable that cuts all one-way trips between Tokyo Station and Shin-Osaka Station to two and a half hours or less, thanks to the retirement of the last of the older, slower 700 series rolling stock. The changes will take effect March 14.

Nozomi service on the Sanyo Shinkansen line between Shin-Osaka Station and Hakata Station in Fukuoka, operated by West Japan Railway, will also run faster. Passengers taking a Nozomi train between Tokyo and Fukuoka will be able to make the trip in just under five hours on average, two minutes less than before.

Also on March 14, East Japan Railway will open its first new station on Tokyo's busy Yamanote loop line in five decades: Takanawa Gateway Station, situated between Shinagawa and Tamachi stations. The additional stop will not change the amount of time taken per loop, according to JR East.

Takanawa Gateway will also be served by the Keihin-Tohoku Line, potentially adding about a minute to travel time on that route.

JR East said Friday that it will add three more high-speed Hayabusa trains each way on the Tohoku Shinkansen between Tokyo and Shin-Aomori, and one local Tanigawa train on the Joetsu Shinkansen between Tokyo and Gunma Prefecture.","Sat, 14 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F9%252F8%252F5%252F5%252F23965589-4-eng-GB%252FCropped-1576270179TX5344P121319%25E3%2581%2597%25E3%2581%258B%25E3%2581%2591P%25EF%25BC%2589JR%25E6%259D%25B1%25E6%25B5%25B7%25E3%2581%25AE%25E3%2581%259E%25E3%2581%25BF%25E2%2591%25A120191213144914196_Data.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['nozomi', 'bullet', 'shinkansen', 'run', 'trips', 'hour', 'railway', 'japan', 'tokyo', 'station', 'japans', 'train', 'line', 'trains', 'crams']",

Global climate change is considered to be a defining issue. As the occurrence of extreme weather conditions, such as extensive drought periods and devastating hurricanes, continue around the world, researchers have turned to rainwater harvesting as a potential solution.

Impact of Climate Change on Water

As temperatures around the world continue to rise, the water cycle inevitably gets negatively affected. More specifically, warmer temperatures cause a greater amount of water to evaporate from both the land and oceans, thereby causing the atmosphere to retain a greater amount of water than it normally would. This increase in water concentration within the atmosphere accounts for the increased flooding and runoff that has been seen in certain areas of the world, whereas other areas will instead experience much less precipitation than what is needed. This ultimately leads to an increase in the droughts and storm track shifts in these regions. It is estimated that for every 1 °F increase in temperature, 4% more water will be evaporated.

What is Rainwater Harvesting?

Rainwater harvesting is defined as the process by which rain is collected and stored for future use. This historical water-conservation technique has been utilized for a variety of purposes ranging from watering plants and cooking to flushing toilets and showering. Due to the fact that temperatures continue to rise around the world, rainwater harvesting techniques have emerged as promising methods by which citizens can attempt to mitigate the effects of global warming.

The harvesting of rainwater can be achieved through both large-scale and small-scale solutions. For example, a small-scale solution that can be used to harvest rainwater can be as simple as placing a large barrel or cistern beneath the gutter of a home, obtaining the collected rainwater and then using the water for potable or non-potable purposes.

While such small-scale rainwater harvesting techniques can provide families and smaller groups of individuals with the water needed to bathe, cook, drink and irrigate plants, larger harvesting systems can be useful for ways in which communities can relieve urban water supply and drainage pressures. For example, some rainwater harvesting systems used in Samarang, Indonesia are based on a water tank design, in which gravity allows the water to flow into the system, thereby eliminating the need to utilize electricity for pumping. The collected water can then be used immediately or stored for future use during this region’s dry season. Another type of rain harvesting system can be based on an absorption well design, in which rainwater is collected and directly funneled into the ground for future acquisition.

Rainwater Harvesting and Storm Management

In addition to exacerbating the evaporation of water in certain areas of the world, climate change has also been shown to cause extreme precipitation events. The effects of these extreme weather events can result in massive costs for the affected areas in terms of casualties, destroyed infrastructure, and economic damage. In fact, since 1980, each of the hurricanes that have hit the United States has resulted in a cumulative cost of $870.2 billion USD. Hurricanes, therefore, represent this nation’s most economically costly type of climate disaster.

A variety of stormwater management strategies that have been based on rainwater harvesting systems have been developed in an effort to reduce the volumes and peaks of urban runoff following these types of extreme weather events. These systems, which have been developed through a number of national stormwater management strategies including the Sustainable Drainage System (SuDS) and the Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD), are also beneficial tools that urban cities have used to reduce the pressure that extreme storms have had on their drainage systems. This also mitigates any environmental impacts that these large bodies of water could have upon entrance into these areas.

Conclusion

The utilization of rainwater techniques can provide immediate assistance for both local and federal purposes. In order to improve the efficiency and reliability of rainwater harvesting systems, the system dimensions, of which include its storage capacity and catchment area, must be carefully engineered according to the location’s specific water demands. Furthermore, these system developers should also incorporate accurate weather prediction models into their rainwater harvesting systems, since future climate change impacts could undoubtedly alter the water savings and performances of these systems. Rainwater harvesting techniques, in addition to many other solutions that must be implemented on both a local and federal level, have the ability to significantly diminish the effects of climate change for a better tomorrow.

French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Ivory Coast yesterday to celebrate Christmas with French troops, coinciding with a push by Paris to strengthen regional ties against militants.

Away from the protest strikes gripping France, Macron was to share a dinner cooked by his personal chef with around 1,000 troops at the military base in Port-Bouet, near Abidjan’s airport.

Macron did not make any declarations on the airport tarmac where he and his wife Brigitte were greeted by his Ivorian counterpart Alassane Ouattara before meeting local chiefs. The insurgency in several poor Sahel nations will be a top item on Macron’s agenda in 48-hour stay.

“He is a young president who works a lot for African countries,” said M’Bollo Koka Denis, traditional chief from Abobo, a working-class district of Abidjan.”This visit should bring us security, as we’ve been threatened for a while now.”

Dining in a huge tent installed on a football pitch, guests were to tuck into traditional French Christmas fare, including foie gras, poultry from the Landes region served with morel mushrooms, regional French cheeses, chocolate cake and mandarines from Corsica.

He was to meet several French soldiers who took part in November in an anti-terrorist operation in Mali, where 13 men lost their lives.Tomorrow, Macron will pay a flying visit for talks with President Mahamadou Issoufou of Niger, where militant attacks are frequent, as in both neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso.

The leaders of five Sahel nations are due to attend a summit in Paris on January 13. Macron spent Christmas in 2017 with troops deployed to Niger and went last year to Chad.

The men in Ivory Coast serve as a support force in anti-militant operations and constitute the largest French contingent in Africa after the one in Djibouti on the northeastern side of the continent.

Today, Macron and Ouattara will visit an International Counter-Terrorism Academy launched by the two countries near Abidjan in October 2018.","Sat, 21 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.gulf-times.com/Content/Upload/Slider/122019210436669639032.jpg,"['macron', 'sahel', 'president', 'christmas', 'ivory', 'paris', 'coast', 'troops', 'visit', 'french', 'traditional', 'regional']",

The death toll from the powerful quake that hit the southern Philippines climbed to five on Monday as rescuers used heavy equipment and their bare hands to hunt for survivors in a collapsed building.

Sunday's tremor cracked schools, toppled homes and injured dozens but largely spared big cities on the island of Mindanao, which is still recovering from a string of deadly quakes in October.

Searchers pulled more bodies of victims from a collapsed market building in the town of Padada as they hunted for possible survivors trapped under the debris.

A child died after being hit by a collapsed wall in her house and a woman in her 70s died from a heart attack during the quake, officials said.

'Ring of Fire'

""We could not yet determine ... exactly how many are still trapped,"" fire official Fred Trajeras told reporters, referring to the market building.

""Our priority is (finding) signs of life, which we hope we can still rescue,"" he added.

The collapsed building was near the epicentre of the 6.8 magnitude quake and is in the same region that was hit by three tremors above 6.0 in a matter of weeks in October.

Those quakes killed some two dozen people and forced tens of thousands into shelters as well as heavily damaging homes and offices.

The Philippines is situated on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.

Searchers were fanning out across the quake hit areas of Mindanao on to fully assess the damage, but have already reported several schools and hospitals were cracked.

President Rodrigo Duterte, who is from Davao and was there during the quake, was not hurt.

""The first lady... said the car she was riding (in) was swaying,"" spokesman Salvador Panelo said.

89,89,FL-2019-000181-IDN,Japan's progressive upstart rattles political establishment - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Japan-s-progressive-upstart-rattles-political-establishment,"TOKYO -- The leader of a small political party with just two seats in the upper house of parliament is emerging as a credible threat to Japan's political establishment.

Taro Yamamoto, 45, who heads the Reiwa Shinsengumi party, is rumored to be contemplating a run in the Tokyo gubernatorial election slated for next July. Some in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party reckon he could mount a serious challenge against the reelection of incumbent Yuriko Koike if all opposition parties rally behind him.

The Reiwa Shinsengumi also stands to win seats in a lower house election that sitting lawmakers increasingly believe Abe will call next year.

Yamamoto, a former TV personality and actor, entered politics in 2013, when he was elected to the upper house by opposing nuclear energy. The Reiwa Shinsengumi party, which he set up in April this year, produced two lawmakers in an upper house election held just three months later.

In that upper house election, Yamamoto campaigned on unabashedly populist messages, such as abolishing the consumption tax and immediately halting all nuclear reactors, garnering over 900,000 votes, a record for an individual politician. Because he put his name third on the proportional-representation candidate list, he himself did not make the cut this time, but the candidates that were first and second on the list were elected, both of whom have severe physical disabilities.

He has continued to enjoy solid support ever since, receiving speech requests across the country. Sitting on cheaper, unreserved seats on shinkansen bullet trains in traveling from city to city, he readily agrees to take selfies with supporters, which are promptly spread through social media. His popularity may be compared to that of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, or AOC, a freshman congresswoman from New York who pulled off a spectacular primary upset by defeating a 10-time Democratic incumbent.

Some see Taro Yamamoto mounting a credible challenge against the reelection of Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike next year.

Reiwa Shinsengumi is believed to have raised over 400 million yen ($3.65 million at current rates) through crowdfunding in the run-up to the upper house election. Even now supporters offer donations after listening to his speeches.

Among his ardent fans are those in the so-called lost generation, who had the misfortune of having to find jobs during the economic stagnation that followed the bubble economy of the late 1980s and early 1990s, and younger urbanites in their 20s or 30s.

""Young people probably see Yamamoto as an advocate who can express the anxiety or frustration toward society that they are feeling,"" says Megumi Ushikubo, a commentator familiar with social trends.

""Many in their 20s or 30s were raised by parents who held a deep apathy toward politics and grew up thinking it was useless to get politically involved or fight against the system,"" she continued. ""Even before getting married, they are already worried about money for their kids' education but they are not motivated to do something. Yamamoto is the person who will act on their behalf.""

In fact, Reiwa Shinsengumi's policy platform says it aims to create a society where people can live without anxiety about the future, promising to cancel student debt.

""It is commendable that they promised to use tax money for paying back student debt,"" said Tokai University Vice Chancellor Yutaka Tsujinaka.

He is also impressed by the party's pledge to increase the number of civil servants.

""According to an OECD survey, the number of Japanese civil servants is roughly one-third the average number among member nations,"" said Tsujinaka. ""With too small a government, the people are unlikely to feel they are getting what they are paying for in taxes, and just feel the burden of tax payments,"" he continued. ""A sufficient number of civil servants and adequate funding are necessary to provide necessary public services.""

Yamamoto's ideas for funding such services seem to go against traditional textbook economics. He advocates abolishing the consumption tax and providing monthly cash payouts by issuing new government debt. His ideas are based on the modern monetary theory gaining traction among some scholars in the U.S. and elsewhere. The theory holds that nations with sovereign monetary policies are not constrained by revenues when it comes to spending because they can print as much money as they desire. But many economists warn that such a move would cause hyperinflation.

Is Yamamotonomics a far-fetched pipe dream?

""Given that Japan and other developed nations are struggling with low inflation, financial markets may react positively to giving cash handouts to cause inflation,"" said Yukichi Shimosato, an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities. The party promises that debt offerings will stop once the 2% inflation target is reached, but Shimosato points out that unlike monetary policy, fiscal policy is inflexible. ""The policy could become out of control.""

The popularity of Yamamoto also reflects the inability of existing opposition parties to respond to voter frustration.","Wed, 18 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F1%252F9%252F6%252F9%252F24019691-1-eng-GB%252F1657033.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['reiwa', 'tax', 'political', 'election', 'progressive', 'upstart', 'rattles', 'yamamoto', 'shinsengumi', 'number', 'japans', 'house', 'establishment', 'upper', 'policy', 'party']",

At a Glance Three major hurricanes left widespread destruction.

Earth's glaciers have shrunk by about 3,860 billion tons this decade.

China created new islands by piling sand and concrete atop coral reefs. Hurricanes, wildfires, oil spills, global warming – there has been no shortage of big news over the last decade. Some of the biggest stories of the past decade were so massive that they were visible from space, captured through state-of-the-art imaging satellites belonging to technology company and imagery provider Maxar Technologies.

Together, the Associated Press and Maxar assembled a selection of the most striking images in weather and nature.

Hurricanes

2017 was the year America's hurricane luck ran out.

For much of the decade that began in 2010, hurricanes with winds of 111 mph or more flirted with Florida and other parts the United States, but never made landfall. In fact, not one major hurricane hit the U.S. between 2006 and 2016. Colorado State University hurricane scientist Phil Klotzbach called it ""an amazing streak of luck.""

Then came 2017. Three powerful hurricanes – Harvey, Irma and Maria – slammed into different parts of the country, causing $265 billion damage in four weeks.

""We set an alarming number of hurricane records in 2017,"" MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel said.

Harvey parked itself over Houston and unleashed a downpour. It killed 68 people and set a U.S. record for amount of rain recorded from a storm: 60.58 inches. Harvey's $120 billion in damage ranks as the second-costliest U.S. storm behind only Katrina in 2005.

Hurricane Irma came next and stayed at maximum Category 5 strength for the longest time ever recorded. Irma was the second-strongest storm recorded in the Atlantic, and it devastated the Caribbean and plowed into Florida. Irma's $50 billion in damage ranks fifth.

The most devastating came last: Hurricane Maria leveled parts of Puerto Rico. Experts still can't agree on how many people died, with some estimates in the thousands. Maria was America's third-costliest storm at $90 billion.

BP Oil Spill

America's biggest offshore oil spill began with an explosion that killed 11 people. It happened April 20, 2010, on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, which was extracting oil for BP. The rig sank two days later on the 40th anniversary of Earth Day. For 87 excruciating days, oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico as people including oil engineers, a Nobel winning scientist and actor Kevin Costner came up with plans to plug the leak that left a bathtub-like ring of coagulated oil on the seafloor.

A team of scientists calculated that 172 million gallons spilled into the Gulf. BP said the number was closer to 100 million gallons, and a federal judge ruled that 134 million gallons had spilled. The case languished in court until April 2016, when a federal judge approved a $20 billion settlement, ruling that BP had been ""grossly negligent.""

By then, the surface of the Gulf of Mexico had no visible scars. Beaches and marshes looked oil-free and back to normal.

However, scientists noticed an increase in dolphin deaths, which had averaged 63 a year before the spill. After the spill, they hit 335 in 2011 and averaged 200 a year for five years. Biologists also reported far fewer numbers of endangered Kemp Ripley sea turtles for years after.

Glacial Melting

Earth's glaciers have shrunk by about 3,860 billion tons this decade, according to research by Michael Zemp at the World Glacier Monitoring Service. That's about 924 trillion gallons of melted ice and snow — enough to cover the United States in water 14 inches deep.

Glaciers in Greenland, including the Petermann, started the decade losing about 54 billion tons of ice a year. It slowed to about 37 billion tons in 2018 before speeding up again in 2019. Glaciers in the Southern Andes lost about 37 billion tons a year in the early part of the decade, and by 2018 they were losing nearly 47 billion tons a year.

""The last decade has been devastating for Earth's glaciers and ice sheets, and unlike anything modern humanity has seen before,"" ice scientist Twila Moon of the National Snow and Ice Data Center said in an email. ""Communities have lost drinking, agriculture and hydropower resources as small glaciers have in some instances completely disappeared. Sea level rise from ice loss across the globe has increased flooding, coastal erosion, and health and safety problems, impacting people's lives, communities, and economies.""

Wildfires

The scope of the worst wildfire in California history hits home when seen from 300 miles above Earth.

What happened in Paradise has become a cautionary tale about the kind of devastation that is possible when erratic winds carry sparks across a warming planet.

Eighty-five people died. Some perished in cars on roads so choked by traffic they couldn't outrun the flames. Roughly 19,000 homes, businesses and other buildings were destroyed.

The state's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., was blamed for the fire – one of dozens of blazes its equipment has caused in recent years – and forced into bankruptcy. A grim new reality emerged: widespread preemptive blackouts to stop power lines from sparking new blazes. Lawmakers approved hundreds of millions of dollars for firefighting and aggressive brush clearing to protect communities.

The fire has not led to limits on construction in especially fire-prone rural and mountainous terrain, where homes are more affordable. During a severe state housing shortage, a new Paradise is rising from the ashes.

Japan Earthquake – Fukushima

A magnitude 9.0 earthquake and giant tsunami struck the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant in Japan on March 11, 2011, causing its key cooling systems to fail, resulting in the meltdown of three reactors and spreading radiation into surrounding communities and out at sea.

Concerns about radiation at one point displaced about 160,000 people, splitting many families and communities. More than 40,000 still have not been allowed back.

The plant has since been stabilized and is being decommissioned, and officials say that could take decades. Removing the estimated 800 tons of melted debris and cleaning up the complex is an unprecedented challenge, some experts say. If or when the task can be done remains in question.

The scrutiny that followed revealed poor risk management practices by the government and plant operators and shed light on the lack of safety measures, prompting the public's distrust and contributing to widespread anti-nuclear sentiment. Japan temporarily shut down all reactors for safety checks and introduced stricter safety standards. The approvals take time, and a handful of reactors have since been restarted.

The Fukushima disaster has chilled the nuclear industry around the world. In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe still promotes nuclear energy as a key component of the nation's energy mix, but the government had to largely abandon plans for nuclear plant exports and business overseas.

China Expansion - South China Sea

Across the sprawling and strategic South China Sea, nearly 70 disputed islands, reefs and atolls are occupied by five claimants. China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia have built airstrips, harbors, barracks and other infrastructure for both civilian and military use. Only China has created new islands by piling sand and concrete atop coral reefs.

That has upset the balance of power in the region, strengthening China's claim to the entire waterway. It also has further harmed the fragile environment already threatened by overfishing, pollution and the harvesting of giant clams by Chinese fishermen.

Starting in 2013, China began dredging sand on a massive scale to build its seven new island outposts, creating 3,200 acres of dry land.

Fiery Cross Reef is among the most extensively developed, boasting large facilities for aircraft, missile batteries and marine forces. Whether or not these islands make a difference remains to be seen, however. Not only are they exposed to the marine environment, but as Japan learned in World War II, holding and supplying remote marine outposts during a conflict can be a tricky proposition, particularly in a region where Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, the U.S. and others have shown a willingness to defend their own interests; territorial, economic and otherwise.

91,91,FL-2019-000181-IDN,"Halal food leaders: Malaysia, Australia and Pakistan retain top APAC spots in Global Islamic Economy report's Top 10 list - FoodNavigator-Asia.com",https://www.foodnavigator-asia.com/Article/2019/12/18/Halal-food-leaders-Malaysia-Australia-and-Pakistan-retain-top-APAC-spots-in-Global-Islamic-Economy-report-s-Top-10-list,"The list ranks economies worldwide based on the Global Islamic Economy Indicator (GIEI), and in this case identifies the countries with economic ecosystems that show the highest potential in developing their local halal food industry.

The value of the global halal food market in 2018 came in at US$1.37tn, and is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% to reach US$1.97tn in 2024.

Malaysia came in second on the list with a score of 74.3, maintaining the same position as last year. Australia rose two ranks to hit fourth place (score not revealed) and Pakistan also rose two spots to reach sixth place this year with a score of 55.

According to the report authors, Malaysia shows strong potential for developing its halal food industry due to its ‘world-class regulation, new initiatives to accredit halal certifiers worldwide, and granting the first Islamic fintech crowdfunding license [amongst others]’​.

“Trade agreements signed with China and Japan [have] strengthened Malaysia’s role in international halal trade,”​ they said.

“[The country] has also further strengthened its investment ecosystem through an increased focus on the Digital Islamic Economy in the backdrop of bilateral meetings with China [and] important investments in local halal companies.”​

The only other Asian country to make the Top 10 list was Brunei, which fell from seventh to eighth spot this year, scoring 53 points.

Almost all other countries in the list were from the Middle East, such as the United Arab Emirates (first place, 91.5), Oman (seventh place, 54), Turkey (ninth place, 52) and Iran (tenth place, 52). Brazil came in third and Sudan fifth.

That said, this list revealed two interesting absences: Both superpower China, which was identified as a major ‘Islamic economy challenger’ in last year’s listing​; and Indonesia, the country with the world’s largest Muslim population.

China was not discussed in detail in this year’s report, other than being mentioned in partnerships or trade with Islamic countries, but Indonesia still managed to score highly in other non-food areas such as finance, travel and fashion.

This was enough to garner it a special mention in the report as a ‘Leading Country’ in terms of Islamic economy.

“Indonesia has [launched] its Halal Economy Masterplan 2019- 2024 through its recently established National Shariah Finance Activity, with the central goal of boosting the role of Islamic finance in driving economic growth,”​ said the report.

“The Masterplan has underpinned broad, ambitious initiatives, recommending four strategic steps, with the goal of making Indonesia a major producer in the global halal industry by 2024.”​

However, no mention was made of the country’s recently-launched new halal certification regulations​, which were started with the food and beverage industry first this year and will expand to other areas such as cosmetics and personal care within the next several years.

Halal food as a whole​

The report also found that of the top five halal food exporters worldwide, two were from the APAC region, namely Australia (second place, US$2.4bn in exports) and India (fourth place, US$1.7bn in exports).

Analysis of Islamic food spending in the region saw Indonesia came in first despite not making the Top 10 list for halal food, at US$173bn, followed by Pakistan in third place (US$119bn), Bangladesh at fifth place (US$82bn) and India at tenth place (US$41bn).

“The scope and scale of halal certification has continued to grow, attracting more global market leaders in the food and beverage industry from across the value chain [in the APAC region],”​ said the authors.

“[For example], Cargill has committed to a US$200mn investment in Pakistan to produce a range of products including edible oils, [and] Australia’s leading supermarket chain Woolworths also launched its Al-Sadiq halal brand, available in 20 stores in communities with high Muslim populations.”​

It was also highlighted that although several countries had laid out strong plans and strategies to develop local halal economies, what was lacking was still proper implementation and regulatory alignment.

“Several Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) governments, including the largest ones, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, are seeking to develop robust halal propositions [and strategies, but these await implementation,”​ they said.

“Halal regulation remains disparate, with OIC importing countries differing on regulations. Developing regulations across OIC countries continues to affect the industry supply chain dynamic. The Indonesian domestic regulation requirement is one major example.” ​","Wed, 18 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-asia.com/headlines/markets/halal-food-leaders-malaysia-australia-and-pakistan-retain-top-apac-spots-in-global-islamic-economy-report-s-top-10-list/10466744-1-eng-GB/Halal-food-leaders-Malaysia-Australia-and-Pakistan-retain-top-APAC-spots-in-Global-Islamic-Economy-report-s-Top-10-list.jpg,"['halal', 'spots', 'reports', 'list', 'score', 'place', 'pakistan', 'report', 'leaders', 'islamic', 'retain', 'industry', 'global', 'indonesia', 'food', 'malaysia', 'countries']",

""Specific inputs were received regarding the involvement of Canadian National of Indian origin in a major seizure of Methamphetamine (200 kgs) in Australia, sourced from Canada. Acting on the inputs the NCB, initiated a trailing inquiry which lead to the inputs that one person Akshinder was involved in various shipments and parcels from Canada to Australia. One such parcel originated from Canada and destined to India, was intercepted by NCB and 422 grams of Cocaine was found concealed in the parcel,"" said Jha.

""Further, raids in Jalandhar led to the arrest of Akshdinder with more recoveries of Cocaine and other psychotropic drugs. Various Canadian and Australian links of Akshinder were discovered during inquiry and further surveillance was mounted on the network,"" said Jha.

""Subsequently, information was received from Australia that 55 Kgs of Cocaine shipped from India was seized by Australian authorities. The backtracking of the shipment was conducted by NCB and it unearthed that this international syndicate members are spread across India and having links in Australia, Canada and Nigeria,"" said Jha.

""Raids were conducted by the NCB team and R Singh was apprehended from Ghaziabad with 10 kgs of Cocaine in his possession, Sammy and V Chhabra were nabbed from Uttrakhand while M Rainheart, Indonesian national was arrested near Vasant Kunj, New Delhi. During her search 500 grams of cocaine was recovered from her possession,"" said Jha.

""During interrogation, the accused R Singh revealed that he used to work as man-Friday for the members of this cartel and they had also registered one company on his name with the target to build the necessary financial credentials which were to be used in international trade. Singh used to assist the group in delivering the cocaine to the clients and their destination used to be in and around Shipra mall in Ghaziabad,"" said Jha.

""Sammy and V Chhabra disclosed that they were working on behest of international drug trafficking syndicate spread across Canada, Australia, India and Nigeria,"" said Jha.

""During interrogation Rainheart revealed that she met one Indian named Raj in a night club in Malaysia during her holiday. She and Raj discussed the proposition of narcotics trade across the world and Raj explained the possibilities of lucrative narcotics trade in India.

94,94,FL-2019-000181-IDN,Brazil on the precipice: from environmental leader to despoiler (2010-2020) - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2019/12/brazil-on-the-precipice-from-environmental-leader-to-despoiler-2010-2020/,"Brazil’s 21st century environmental record is most easily visualized via Amazon deforestation: poor regulation and lawlessness led to peak deforestation in 2004, with 27,772 square kilometers cleared. Better laws and enforcement, and a soy moratorium led to a dramatic decline to 4,571 square kilometers in 2012.

Since then, first under Workers’ Party President Dilma Rousseff, then under Michel Temer, deforestation rates began to rise. The rate saw its biggest jump this year under President Jair Bolsonaro, with a loss of 9,762 square kilometers — the worst deforestation since 2008.

From 2011-2016, the Amazon saw numerous hydroelectric project controversies, including the construction of the Belo Monte mega-dam, two huge hydroelectric projects on the Madeira River, plus multiple dams on the Teles Pires River. The Lava Jato corruption scandal and an economic downturn curbed dam building.

Brazil’s ruralist agribusiness interests consolidated power, first under Temer, and more so under Bolsonaro, launching multiple attacks on indigenous and traditional land rights. Bolsonaro’s anti-environmental and anti-indigenous policies are a mark of his administration, a trend expected to continue in 2020.

In 2010 there were sound reasons for concern over the future of the Amazon — the earth’s greatest remaining forest, especially in Brazil. Huge hydroelectric projects were underway; agribusiness, particularly cattle ranching, was eating deeper into the Amazon; and genetically modified crops had been authorized, making it easier to grow soy in extreme tropical conditions, allowing for rapid expansion. Fewer protected areas were being created and recognition of indigenous land was happening at a snail’s pace.

Even so, there was room for hope. Environmentalists felt encouraged by an annual rate of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon that had plunged to roughly a quarter of its earlier level — from 27,772 square kilometers (10,722 square miles) in 2004, down to 7,000 square kilometers (2,702 square miles) in 2010. Felling an area of tropical forest annually equivalent to eight times the size of New York City may have seemed horrifying to many then, but at least the trend was downwards. And the scale of deforestation didn’t seem to represent an imminent existential risk.

The decade ahead, some said, might even hold promise.…

Why deforestation fell in Amazônia, then rose

To understand what happened in Brazil over the last decade, it’s necessary to look back a little farther. In 2003, new Brazilian President Luiz Inácio da Silva, from the Workers’ Party (PT), appointed Marina Silva as environment minister. Silva, renowned as a committed environmentalist, was born into a family of Amazonian rubber tappers. Although the rate of deforestation took off during the first two years of Lula’s government, it fell during Silva’s tenure, until by 2012, well after she left office, it was down to 4,511 square kilometers (2,803 square miles) annually — just a sixth of the 2004 level.

Much of Silva’s success was due to her strategy of penning in development pressure by creating protected areas around big infrastructure projects and agribusiness expansion. Environmentalists drew up plans for vast new conservation units, but at first congress obstructed. The bancada ruralista agribusiness lobby — dominant in government today — was already powerful, forming a large bloc in the legislature, creating problems for Lula.

Then came the assassination of the American nun, Dorothy Stang in January 2005.

Sister Dorothy, as she was universally called, had campaigned fearlessly against illegal loggers, land grabbers and ranchers destroying the forest and threatening the livelihoods of poor rural populations in the Amazon basin. Her brutal assassination was a political embarrassment for the government. Responding to international outrage, Lula blew the dust off Silva’s plan to protect vast swathes of Amazon forest.

Just a few days after Sister Dorothy’s death, Lula, flanked by Silva, announced the creation of an 8.3 million-hectare (32,000 square-mile) “mosaic” of protected areas, spanning the southern Amazon basin, from Pará state in the east, to Mato Grosso state in the south, to Rondônia in the west — a conservation blockade against agribusiness intrusion.

The mosaic, along with other government measures, undoubtedly contributed to the decline in deforestation. But a more prosaic, reason — a pause in the world commodity boom in 2004 – also contributed. The underlying factor fueling Amazon deforestation had been soy production expansion via this process: land speculators cut down the forest, sold the land to ranchers, who after a few years, sold it to soy producers who created gigantic plantations in the Amazon. So a plunge in soy prices may have contributed to the deforestation decline.

Yet another factor was the availability of cleared forest: after the felling frenzy in 2004, ranching and agribusiness didn’t need more land.

This breathing space made it easier for environmental NGOs to influence international commodities companies to alter their behavior. First in 2006 came the Amazon soy moratorium, by which commodities companies agreed not to purchase soy cultivated on recently cleared Amazon forest lands, and then, in 2009, a beef moratorium. Although structural weaknesses allowed farmers to find ways of getting round them, the moratoriums reflected growing consumer concern over Amazon deforestation.

Lula and Dilma: dams and more dams

Then came major setbacks. During Lula’s second term (2007 to 2010), Brazil’s economy became increasingly dependent on commodity exports, strengthening ruralist power and emboldening them to openly clash with environmentalists. But politically savvy Lula found a way to mediate: the president would approve a big Amazon hydro-dam to serve the ruralists, then placate environmentalists by creating more protected areas.

His successor, Dilma Rousseff (2010-2016), handpicked by Lula, lacked political flair. She carried on with Lula’s policies but made little attempt to mollify environmentalists. She became widely disliked by conservationists, and also eventually by the ruralists, which would be her undoing.

In June 2011, Rousseff gave the go-ahead for the controversial Belo Monte mega-dam on the Xingu River — touted then as the third biggest in the world. Rhett Butler, Mongabay’s founder, wrote a heartfelt article at the time, in which he expressed shock at the government’s decision, noting that the dam would displace 16,000 people and flood 40,000 hectares (100,000 acres) of forest.

“When I speak to audiences,” he wrote, “I use Brazil as an example of a country that is leading the transition toward a more just and sustainable economy. With Belo Monte, I’m no longer certain Brazil is the model to emulate” Indeed, Belo Monte — with its deforestation, devastation of indigenous and traditional communities, and wrecking of natural habitats, along with corruption – was a bellwether of things to come.

By 2016, leading Brazilian commentators had concluded that Belo Monte was a bad project from “an economic, fiscal, environmental and human point of view.”

Over time, the scale of Belo Monte’s catastrophic harm became clear. Many tens of thousands of indigenous and traditional people were forced from their homes and lost their livelihoods. Fish kills caused Xingu River populations to decline heavily. By late 2019, it was clear that the future of the dam itself was compromised by recurrent droughts — droughts that have occurred periodically for decades and should have been predicted — while the dam’s construction was even found to be dangerously defective.

Belo Monte was no isolated case. In a raft of big development projects, Lula and Rousseff gave the go-ahead to two mega-dams on the Madeira River, near the frontier with Bolivia. Both caused serious environmental and social problems, and continue to do so. They also built four dams on the Teles Pires River, failing to consult indigenous people as required by international treaty and even permitting the dynamiting of rapids, sacred to the Munduruku people.

When prosecutors from the Federal Public Ministry (MPF), a group of independent public litigators, went to court on behalf of indigenous groups to halt the Teles Pires dams, they often won, but then the government used a highly questionable legal instrument, the so-called “Suspensão de Segurança,” to get its way. Through this instrument, a legacy from Brazil’s 1964-1988 military dictatorship, the government — then and now — can postpone the implementation of any lower court decision until the end of a lengthy legal process by simply declaring a threat to “national security.” In practice, this means the original ruling is overturned.

Still, the government and dam developers didn’t always win. The Munduruku and other indigenous groups, along with traditional communities fought back. In August 2016, after persistent indigenous pressure, the environmental agency, IBAMA, denied a licence for another gigantic dam planned for the Tapajós River — the 8,000 megawatt São Luiz de Tapajós. No subsequent government has attempted to reverse that decision.

Temer undermines socioenvironmental gains

It was the gigantic government-funded dam projects that ultimately helped bring about Rousseff’s and the Workers’ Party undoing, bringing the far right to power.

Lava Jato, Operation Car Wash, a massive corruption investigation, found that the PT had been running a gigantic payoff operation involving Petrobras, Brazil’s state-run oil company, along with Brazil’s gigantic construction companies. The scheme: construction firms, including Odebrecht, Andrade Gutierrez and others, offered massive political contributions to the Workers’ Party, and others, in trade for mega-dams and a variety of development contracts. It was Lava Jato public outcry against corruption that finally helped lead to the impeachment of Rousseff in August 2016 and her replacement by Michel Temer.

Under Temer, an unpopular president whose approval rating never rose above the single digits, was someone the ruralists were able to easily dominate. By mid-2017, they were largely calling the shots, with Temer requiring their support to prevent Congress from impeaching him for corruption connected to JBS, Brazil’s giant meatpacking firm.

The ruralists leveraged their power to boost agribusiness, and chip away at environmental advances, with a particular determination to undermine indigenous land rights. The ruralists had longed complained of Brazil’s indigenous peoples occupying 12 percent of Brazilian territory while making up only 0.5% of the population. Ignoring the key role that indigenous communities play in protecting forests, they asserted time and again that this was grossly unfair. But over time it became increasingly clear that what was driving the ruralists was desire for these lands.

So the first priority of ruralists under Temer was to stop the slow and meticulous indigenous reserve demarcation process, underway since the implementation of the progressive 1988 Constitution, by which indigenous groups gained formal recognition of the land they occupy.

The ruralistas’ strategy wasn’t to present bills to Congress where they still lacked the votes needed for passage, but to use indirect tactics, such as accepting a recommendation made by the Attorney General’s Office that federal government bodies should adopt new stringent criteria for recognizing indigenous lands, aimed at stalling the demarcation process.

Respected lawyer Dalmo de Abreu Dallari, said of the new demarcation criteria that it had as its objective the “extorting from indigenous communities their right to the land they have traditionally occupied.”

Temer did much else: he introduced an amnesty erasing up to $2.1 billion in unpaid environmental fines, especially for illegal deforestation. To howls of indignation from human rights activists, he issued a decree weakening the definition of slavery, excluding those working in degrading and inhumane conditions. But he didn’t always win. His attempt to open the gigantic and pristine 4.6 million hectare (17,800 square mile) RENCA preserve in the northern Amazon to Canadian and other transnational mining interests was defeated by a national and international public outcry.

Emboldened by their success, the ruralists stepped up violent attacks in remote areas. In 2017, Brazil became the most dangerous country in the world for social and environmental activists, with 57 assassinations as a result of land conflict.

Then came Bolsonaro

In October 2018 the ruralists solidified their power by supporting former army officer, Jair Bolsonaro who was elected President.

Now, the ruralists, in unprecedented fashion, operated the levers of government, controlling 44% of the Congress and represented by a president whose extreme policies even made some in agribusiness uncomfortable. Populist Bolsonaro is a climate change denier, is openly hostile toward indigenous peoples, even believes that landowners have the right to bear arms to defend themselves against people who reject their illicit land claims, and he looks back nostalgically at Brazil’s military dictatorship.

From his first day in office, Bolsonaro began slashing away at the web of laws, regulations and agencies meant to curb environmental harm caused by mining, agribusiness and big infrastructure projects.

The journalist Bernardo Mello Franco, who writes for Brazil’s influential O Globo newspaper, called Bolsonaro’s environment minister Ricardo Salles, himself under investigation for environmental crime, an “anti-minister, who is doing all he can to destroy what he should be protecting” and who is turning “his ministry into a playground for the ruralists.”

Even before Bolsonaro came to power, the authorities’ lack of concern for environmental safety was costing Brazil dear. In November 2015 a Vale Corporation tailings storage dam collapsed in Mariana in Minas Gerais state, killing 19 and polluting the Doce River for 440 miles. Then in January 2019, as Bolsonaro stepped into office, another Vale tailings dam disaster occurred in Brumadinho, also in Minas Gerais. It killed 249 people, leaving another 21 missing.

Under Bolsonaro deforestation is rising again, as illegal loggers and land grabbers take advantage of the permissive political climate. Altogether, 7,604 square kilometers (2,970 square miles) of rainforest were felled during the first nine months of this year, an 85 percent increase over the same period last year.

In August, images of raging Amazon fires were splashed across the front pages of the world press, particularly after Brazil’s largest city, São Paulo, went dark at midday as winds, carrying smoke from the fires, blocked out the sun. That one event could be considered symbolic of what may lay ahead for Brazil’s environment, the Amazon and its people.

Violence is surging, as lawless bands, emboldened by the ruralists and Bolsonaro’s incendiary rhetoric, kill social, political and environmental activists. Among many recent incidents, two Guajajara indigenous leaders were shot dead in early December, not far from where another Guajajara leader and “forest guardian” was killed a month earlier.

International reverberations

Ominously, what is happening in Brazil won’t likely stay there. Experts warn that the current deforestation will make it virtually impossible for Brazil, the world’s seventh largest emitter of greenhouse gases, to achieve the commitments it made under the 2015 Paris Agreement, and may possibly jeopardize the whole global accord.

Moreover, deforestation, combined with escalating climate change, is pushing the Amazon toward a rainforest-to-savanna “tipping point” which would result in massive tree death and a gush of sequestered carbon into the atmosphere at a time when the world can least afford it. Ironically, the mega-drought that could soon devastate Amazon forests would also empty Brazil’s aquifers and be catastrophic for agribusiness — and thus for the whole Brazilian economy.

Some of the world’s largest companies are getting worried and responding to Bolsonaro’s polices. In September 2019, some 230 global investors with $16.2 trillion in assets urged companies to eliminate Amazon deforestation from their supply chains. Then in December, 87 large UK companies, including Tesco and Sainsbury, signed a letter to Bolsonaro asking his government to stop Amazon deforestation for soy production.

International pressure seems likely to grow as the president turns increasingly belligerent and aggressive, but it will take more than urging to save the Amazon basin. Some activists think the only current hope for the rainforest may lie with an international boycott. Combined with the growing mobilization of social movements underway inside Brazil, such a boycott might cause the Bolsonaro government to rethink its policies in the years ahead.

Disturbingly, scientists can’t pinpoint an ecological tipping point until it is passed. But some warn that Amazon deforestation could be pushing things dangerously close to collapse. Assuring a positive future for Brazil and the world requires putting on the brakes before the precipice is reached.

Agriculture is the root cause of 80% of tropical deforestation.

Regenerative agroforestry, an agricultural method that mimics natural ecosystems, could help reverse these trends.

Our world is changing. The EU has just declared a climate emergency and stated that Europe must reach zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 - in the same year, our planet’s population is expected to hit 10 billion people. Global food production needs to prepare for an uncertain future and rising populations.

Climate, soil and farming: an intimate relationship

How we produce food is having a massive impact on our planet and driving the climate crisis. Farming is responsible for almost 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Land conversion and external inputs required for industrial agriculture lead to ecological dead-zones. Mechanization and commonly used synthetic fertilizers cause various emissions, while intensive management to raise crop yields releases carbon from the soil.

Inefficiency threatens biodiversity

Turning biodiversity-rich areas into intensified, monoculture farming, drives land degradation and soil erosion, threatening the world’s food supplies. According to the Director-General of the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN), “the increasing loss of biodiversity for food and agriculture puts food security and nutrition at risk”.

Small to no profits for farmers

Market pressures force farmers globally to intensify agriculture and focus on short-term investment returns. Because of soil degradation, they increasingly rely on pesticides and synthetic fertilizers to maintain productivity. As costs rise, earnings shrink and farmers become trapped in debt, taking out yearly loans to pay for external inputs.

Climate crisis for farming

Global farming has reached a crisis point. Intensified land use and inefficient human systems threaten food security and drive biodiversity loss and climate change. Half the world’s fertile soil is already lost and, with an estimated 60 years of topsoil left, we need a farming strategy that restores soil and secures food production.

It is possible to put global agriculture into a climate-smart future and the solution already exists. Practised around the world, it’s known as regenerative agroforestry.

Regenerative agroforestry: farming in nature’s image

Regenerative agroforestry is an agricultural method that mimics natural ecosystems. Through holistic management and smart design, various components like crops, trees, plants and livestock combine to form a diverse, self-sustaining production system.

This method puts agriculture back into the landscape and improves the resilience of food production against the impacts of climate change. Its systems can withstand droughts, pests and floods much better than conventional systems.

Boosting soil fertility and biodiversity

Healthy soils are the backbone of our supply chains. The diversity of plant life within an agroforestry system boosts soil fertility. Beyond fostering food production, this prevents soil erosion, regulates water cycles, sequesters carbon and controls pests and weeds.

Farming with nature, not against it, makes farmland habitable again for a vast array of animals and insects. That is crucial for food production: 87 of the world’s leading food crops rely on pollinators. By mimicking natural systems, regenerative agroforestry creates a stronger foundation for farming.

Enhancing agricultural capacities

Regenerative agroforestry enhances agricultural productivity. The diversity of plants creates biomass throughout the year, fertilizing the soil and increasing crop yields while providing fodder for livestock. Moreover, planting trees on a farm protects crops from wind and sunlight.

By enhancing agriculture, we improve the efficiency of land use and eliminate the need to expand into pristine, biodiversity-rich areas.

Improving farmer livelihoods

Farming systems which focus on one income stream, such as cattle or coffee, are financially vulnerable. If the market crashes or drought impacts crop yields, farmers can be left without income. The diversity of regenerative agroforestry creates various income streams and increases economic resilience.

A project in Indonesia, for example, combines the cultivation of white pepper with various other products. Next to these, farmers grow mangos, bananas and timber, which can be sold locally or used for family consumption. Tanzanian farmers, mix lucrative cash crops, such as cardamom, with by-products, like bananas, beans and maize. Trees can be grown on steep slopes or where soils are poor, allowing farmers to make the most of their available space.

Turning degraded land into carbon sinks

Regenerative agroforestry sequesters significantly more carbon than industrial agriculture and can help to restore degraded land. According to UN Scientists, restoring 900 million hectares could stabilize global GHG emissions for 15-20 years. With agroforestry, we can transform degraded land into food-growing carbon sinks.

Regenerative agroforestry: a major solution

Regenerative agroforestry is a resilient and future-proof agricultural method that could help solve the climate crisis. This smart farming system enables economically viable production while restoring land, mitigating climate change, protecting biodiversity and enhancing food security for growing populations.","Fri, 20 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://assets.weforum.org/editor/c6aAMkhGck3kkzoyguOZouIbvXszU7puqSlEP0iy4Nc.PNG,"['regenerative', 'farming', 'solve', 'crisis', 'soil', 'agriculture', 'production', 'farmers', 'climate', 'agroforestry', 'global', 'food', 'land']",
