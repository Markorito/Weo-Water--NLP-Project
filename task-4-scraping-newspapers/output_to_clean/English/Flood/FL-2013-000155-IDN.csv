Gadjah Mada University (UGM) in Yogyakarta has begun planning and developing its Wisdom Park, an open green area equipped with various eco-friendly facilities, the project is part of the university's efforts to become a green campus.



UGM has declared 2014 to be the year it will transform into a green campus.



'As an initial step, we are currently building Wisdom Park, which is located on Jl. Prof. Notonegoro, or the northern UGM complex,' UGM rector Pratikno said recently.



The park will include sports facilities, a jogging track, a tunnel connecting the northern and southern parts of the campus, a park, a rain-water collection pool, conservation land, a fishery and an arboretum.



It will be open to the public and students alike.



'The presence of the rain-water collection pool is part of our flood mitigation efforts, which are aimed at lessening floods in the downstream areas, such as Samirono, which is prone to flooding,' said Pratikno.



UGM, he added, was also working with various parties, including the Public Works Ministry to build Wisdom Park. In 2014, for instance, UGM will team up with the ministry to develop the on-campus Tap Water Installation System, or SPAM, which is expected to meet the water needs of campus residents.



'We have prepared various plans to realize a campus that has zero gas emissions and we need support and cooperation from partners in implementing our vision,' said Pratikno.



He added that the development of Wisdom Park was not only in the interests of UGM but also for the general public.



'We wish to turn UGM into an inspirational campus that could serve as a model for progress and sustainable development,' he said.



UGM Development and Planning Directorate director Muhammad Sulaiman said the area was part of a catchment area, so its development and spatial planning should be in line with environmental conservation.



'The reorganization of the UGM valley area as a collection pool to curb floods from the Belik River is crucial to reduce water volume at the peak of flood season in the Klitren area and other downstream areas,' said Sulaiman.



Sulaiman cited environmental-based planning included the rerouting of the drainage system from the UGM valley area to Jl. Prof. Johanes on the western part of the campus, to Bethesda Hospital and finally to the Code River.



As an effort to reorganize and design the green campus, UGM organized a workshop to obtain input.



As many as 150 participants from various agencies, community leaders and NGOs attended the workshop.



To realize the plan, UGM has implemented various environmentally-friendly policies, such as UGM Green Bicycle, which provided hundreds of bicycles across the campus that can be used by guests and campus residents for free.



The university sees a future where the UGM complex will be free of motorized vehicles with bicycles being the only mode of transportation","Tue, 17 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.thejakartapost.com/favicon.ico,"['water', 'campus', 'mada', 'planning', 'development', 'area', 'various', 'university', 'gadjah', 'ugm', 'wisdom', 'clean', 'future', 'park', 'green']",

As one of the last films that Paul Walker completed before his untimely death, Hours offers a different kind of race from those featured in the Fast and Furious series that propelled him to fame.



This time, Walker races against time during the onslaught of Hurricane Katrina in the US.



The film is set during the storm and its aftermath, when the city of New Orleans, which lies well below sea level, was almost entirely flooded when its protective levees failed.



Action takes place entirely in a hospital that was later closed due to massive damage sustained during the storm.



Walker plays Nolan Hayes, whose vivacious wife, Abigail, (Genesis Rodriguez, who previously starred in a host of telenovelas, or Spanish-language sinetron), gives birth weeks earlier than her due date due to complications.



As Nolan waits for his wife outside the delivery room, the hurricane starts to wreck the city, including parts of the hospital, forcing those assembled to move to another waiting room.

Soon, the doctor tells Nolan that his wife died on the operating table after giving birth to a baby girl, who needs a machine to breathe.



For millions in the US, Aug. 29, 2005 became a demarcation point in time: before and after Katrina. For Nolan, that day was forever linked to the death of his wife and the birth of his first child.



Nolan at first refuses to accept his daughter, but he sticks with her and waits for her until she no longer needs the ventilator.



After seeing the baby, Nolan starts to search for his wife's body, which he finds on the floor, as the hospital's morgue is overloaded due to the hurricane.



Oddly, when he asks the hospital's staff to help him move the body to a higher place, he does not even pull back the sheet to see her face for the last time.



While the hospital is evacuated as the hurricane worsens, Nolan must stay because the equipment his daughter still needs to survive is too heavy to transport.



Not long after, the electricity goes out and Nolan has to crank a generator to keep the equipment working. The generator can only provide power for three minutes at a time.



Directed by Eris Heisserer, who scripted A Nightmare on Elm Street and Final Destination 5, the 97-minute drama starts to get tense as Nolan dashes back and forth between finding help and cranking the hand generator every three minutes.



He hunts for food and replacement IV bags, is almost electrocuted as he tries to move the submerged 200-pound generator and races to the roof as he hears helicopters approaching the hospital.



At the point of exhaustion as most of his attempts fall apart, Nolan takes a break and talks to his baby, telling her stories of her mother and showing her things that remind him of her while he tries to keep the baby breathing.



Flashbacks to Abigail and Nolan's first meeting and early days of marriage relieve the tension in the audience, allowing the audience to engage with the movie's storytelling a little bit longer.



While the one-way conversation between Nolan and his baby girl about Abigail is supposed be sentimental, it fails to move the hearts of the audience.



Finally, after more than 20 hours by himself, Nolan gets a boost when a rescue dog appears from out of nowhere.



While his interactions with the dog and a few other funny scenes avoid monotony, Nolan's joy in having company does not last. Looters come to the hospital, stealing Nolan's food and the hospital's pharmacy.



Hours is a one-man drama that aims to show the strength of a man and a father in emergency situation. It also gives a closer look and reminds us at how bad the damage from Katrina was through actual newscasts featured in the movie.



At the same time, it also gives an overview of desperate people who wait for help and take advantage of the disaster.



For those who miss Walker's acting ' and face ' Hours is a must-see film as he becomes the focus of the entire film.



Hours is currently in cinemas in Indonesia.","Thu, 19 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.thejakartapost.com/files/images2/p22-aonscreen_0.img_assist_custom-498x281.jpg,"['nolans', 'needs', 'nolan', 'hours', 'walkers', 'paul', 'baby', 'hurricane', 'starts', 'katrina', 'hospital', 'race', 'generator', 'wife']", 
4,4,FL-2013-000155-IDN,Disaster losses $130 billion in 2013: Swiss Re - SKNVibes.com,https://m.sknvibes.com/news/newsdetails.cfm/82910,"(Geneva, CHE) - Disasters caused global economic losses of about $130 billion (94.5 billion euros) this year, Swiss Re said on Wednesday, but there was little insurance coverage for the deadliest catastrophe, Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.

In a preliminary estimate of the impact of natural and man-made disasters, the Zurich-based reinsurance group noted that the economic impact was sharply down from $196 billion in 2012, a year marked by Superstorm Sandy in the United States.

But the total loss of life climbed to about 25,000 people from 14,000 in 2012, it said.

Last month's Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines was the deadliest single disaster, killing more than 7,000 people, Swiss Re noted.

But despite the devastation wreaked, insured losses from the typhoon are expected to be modest, it said.

It pointed to the low proportion of insurance coverage in the Philippines -- a common issue in developing nations, which are also amongst the globe's most disaster-prone countries.

Swiss Re did not release an estimate for the Philippines, but insurance- and disaster-risk modellers AIR Worldwide recently put the economic losses at $6.5-14.5 billion, and insurance coverage at $300-700 million.

The latter figure accounted only for physical damage to insured buildings and their contents, and did not include such areas as losses of crops or business interruption, AIR Worldwide noted.

""In many parts of the world, insurance penetration remains low,"" Swiss Re's chief economic Kurt Karl said in a statement.

""Together with preventative measures, insurance can lessen the destructive impact and financial burden that large catastrophic events can have on people's lives. It can also help accelerate reconstruction efforts, as we have seen in areas where insurance penetration is higher,"" he added.

The insurance industry is likely to cover about $44 billion of the 2013 disaster losses, Swiss Re said.

It noted that the figure was substantially lower than the $81 billion in payouts last year, largely down to Superstorm Sandy.

The costliest single disaster of 2013, both in terms of losses and likely insurance payouts, was the flooding in June that battered Germany, the Czech Republic and neighbouring countries in central Europe.

The floods, which claimed two dozen lives, caused economic losses of around $18 billion, with $4.0 billion of that insured, Swiss Re said.

Insured losses were nonetheless higher than during the 2002 floods in the same region, which cost the industry $3.0 billion at current prices.

The June 2013 disaster ranked as the second most expensive fresh-water flood on record, but still lies a distant second to the 2011 Thailand floods which led to insured claims of over $16 billion, Swiss Re underlined.

Europe was also hit by Hailstorm Andreas in Germany and France in July, with insured losses of $3.0 billion.

The more recent Windstorm Christian and Windstorm Xavier in central and northern Europe triggered insured losses of around $1.0 billion each.

June rains and flooding in the Canadian province of Alberta led to insured losses of $2.0 billion, the highest ever recorded in the country for any disaster.

There were also heavy rains and floods in Australia, India, China, Indonesia, Southern Africa and Argentina this year.

Harsh spring and autumn weather caused severe thunderstorms and deadly tornadoes in the United States, but the 2013 North Atlantic hurricane season was benign, Swiss Re noted.

The company is set to release its definitive 2013 disaster data in March.","Wed, 18 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",,"['losses', 'typhoon', 'philippines', 'insurance', 'swiss', 'insured', '130', 'disaster', 'economic', 'billion', 'floods']",

Tragic film star Paul Walker founded a charity to combat the effects of natural disasters, as the heartbreaking promotional video above shows.

The beloved Fast & Furious actor, who died on November 30, helped people around the world with his Reach Out Worldwide organisation.

According to its website, ""ROWW is a network of professionals with first responder skill-sets who augment local expertise when natural disasters strike in order to accelerate relief efforts"".

Walker is quoted by ROWW as saying: ""When you put good will out there, it's amazing what can be accomplished.""

The charity has sent expertise to deal with the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan, the Indonesia tsunami, earthquakes in Chile and Haiti and several tornadoes in the USA.

Paul died alongside pal Roger Roads after the latter lost control of a 2005 Porsche Carrera GT, which slammed into a telegraph pole and then burst into flames.

Last weekend his ashes were interred at Hollywood's Forest Lawn Memorial Park.","Thu, 19 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article2943516.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Paul-Walker-charitable-efforts-remembered.png,"['typhoon', 'play', 'paul', 'charity', 'natural', 'disasters', 'founded', 'wrong', 'haiyan', 'effects', 'video', 'indonesia', 'expertise', 'worldwide', 'walker', 'tsunami', 'tragic', 'roww', 'death', 'died']", 
7,7,FL-2013-000155-IDN,Drone targets boat near Pak-Afghan border: reports - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1073885,"PESHAWAR: A suspected US drone targeted a boat in the waters of the Kabul river on Saturday near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, sources told DawnNews.

According to initial reports, missiles fired by the drone aircraft struck a boat in the Kabul river on the Afghan side of the porous border, close to Loe Shalman area in Landi Kotal subdivision of Pakistan’s Khyber tribal agency.

Intelligence sources suggested the strike was carried out in Lalpura area of Nangarhar province Afghanistan.

According to some reports, the attack killed up to five suspected militants.

There has so far been no official confirmation of the strike from political authorities from either country.

Pakistan condemns drone attacks and says the attacks in the semi-autonomous tribal areas violate its “sovereignty and territorial integrity”.

Pakistan moreover maintains that drone strikes are counter-productive, entail loss of innocent civilian lives and have human rights and humanitarian implications apart from setting dangerous precedents in inter-state relations.

The attack comes days after the US warned Pakistan that coalition support reimbursements and security assistance could be held up if land routes remained closed for movement of US and Nato cargo to and from Afghanistan.

The warning came in US Secretary of Defence Chuck Hagel’s Monday visit to Pakistan during which he met Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Raheel Sharif.

Hagel’s trip, which is also the first by an American defence secretary to Pakistan in four years, followed US decision to suspend the use of land routes through Pakistani territory in the wake of Pakistan Tehrik-i-Insaaf’s protests against drone attacks.","Sat, 14 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.dawn.com/large/2013/12/52ac1f93e38c5.jpeg,"['suspected', 'boat', 'tribal', 'drone', 'targets', 'river', 'sources', 'attacks', 'secretary', 'routes', 'strike', 'reports', 'pakafghan', 'border', 'pakistan', 'near']",

The 16-team competition, due to take place between March 16 and April 6, should be the biggest sporting event ever staged by Bangladesh.

But the country has been gripped by violent protests in recent weeks, with opposition supporters insisting that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stand aside ahead of elections due next year. More than 74 people have been killed since late October.

“If this situation prevails, then any big tournament or participation of any big country will be under threat,” Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Nazmul Hassan told reporters late Monday.

“This must end in January and preferably in December.”

A team of International Cricket Council (ICC) inspectors declared last week that they were “happy” with security arrangements but said they would continue to monitor the situation.

However, the dangers posed to teams was underlined at the weekend when a small bomb exploded outside the West Indies' Under-19 team's hotel in the port city of Chittagong, prompting them to cut short their tour.

Bangladesh is also due to host a tour by Sri Lanka in January before then staging the Asia Cup, a 50-over tournament starting in February.

“The quicker this political situation improves the better because the Sri Lanka tour is in January and then we have the Asia Cup.It needs to be resolved before that,” said Hassan, who is a ruling party lawmaker.

Nizamuddin Chowdhury, the BCB's chief executive, told reporters that the ICC had asked the board to relay them an update on the situation. “We will send (it to) them accordingly,” he said.","Tue, 10 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.dawn.com/large/2013/12/52a716c937698.jpg,"['problem', 't20', 'cricket', 'tour', 'sri', 'told', 'admits', 'tournament', 'world', 'teams', 'bangladesh', 'situation', 'weeks', 'security', 'reporters', 'ahead', 'political']", 
9,9,FL-2013-000155-IDN,A Successful Push to Restore Europe's Long-Abused Rivers - Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/a_successful_push_to_restore_europes_long-abused_rivers,"From the industrial cities of Britain to the forests of Sweden, from the plains of Spain to the shores of the Black Sea, Europe is restoring its rivers to their natural glory. The most densely populated continent on earth is finding space for nature to return along its river banks.

The restoration is not perfect. River floodplains cannot be fully restored when they contain cities, and hydroelectric dams are still needed. But Europe’s fluvial highways are becoming the test bed for conservation biologist Edward O. Wilson’s dream that the 21st century should be “the era of restoration in ecology.”

The Danube River as it flows through Kelheim,

Germany. WIKIMEDIA COMMONS

The political imperative is strong, with the 2000 European Union’s Water Framework Directive requiring that all rivers be returned to a “good status” by 2015. The phrase is not defined, but the idea is that rivers should no longer be used as industrial sewers or as canalized and concreted shipping lanes. The change has been dramatic. While water engineers in Europe have been cleansing rivers of pollution for half a century, they now are trying to restore them to something like their natural state.

Britain, for instance, has promised to restore some 1,500 kilometers of rivers. It has 2,700 projects in its National River Restoration Inventory, 1,500 of them already completed. One of Spain’s largest rivers, the Duero, is being cleared of dams and other man-made obstacles. On France’s longest river, the Loire, where two decades ago activists from all over Europe successfully battled to prevent construction of the Serre de la Fare dam near Le Puy, engineers are now tearing down existing dams, such as the Maisons-Rouges. Denmark’s largest river, the Skjern, is getting back some of the marshlands at its mouth, after meanders were reinstated and artificial banks lowered to allow seasonal flooding of arable fields that have now been returned to grass meadows.

Some of the most dramatic environmental battles in Europe have been over water engineering projects.

For too long, engineers have seen rivers as little more than navigation routes, and pipes to supply water, remove waste, and rush floodwaters to the ocean. Nature was an inconvenience that had to be tamed. But if you pick a fight with nature, you usually lose, as flood engineers from the Mississippi to the Rhine and Danube have learned.

During floods on the Rhine in 1995, levees failed and large parts of the Netherlands at the river’s mouth flooded. The country decided that confronting rivers did not work because, however high you raise the levees, a river in flood will find the weakest spot and burst through. It began instead to set aside land for flooding — to “make room for the river.”

That realization, combined with a growing anti-dam movement, has caused big changes in how engineers considered rivers.

Some of the most dramatic environmental battles in Europe have been over water engineering projects, most notably on the Danube. Back in the 1980s, the Soviet-inspired Gabcikovo-Nagymaros project — aimed at improving navigation, preventing flooding, and generating hydropower for Czechoslovakia and Hungary — helped end the Cold War. Massive opposition in Hungary to the Nagymaros dam on a much loved bend in the Danube near Budapest helped cause an upwelling of more general political opposition that eventually brought down the communist government in 1989.

The Danube, which runs west to east, from Germany’s Black Forest to its delta on the Black Sea, is the most international river in the world, with a catchment that includes 19 countries. The river has been cut off from 80 percent of its floodplain. But today much of the floodplain is slated for restoration.

Austria and Germany have been removing levees to restore the floodplain of a tributary of the Danube.

For instance, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Austria are together putting meanders back into a canalized Danube tributary, the Morava River, where NATO forces on one bank once eyed Warsaw Pact forces on the other. Austria and Germany have been removing levees to restore the floodplain of another tributary, the Inn River, at the foot of the Alps. And downstream, Ukraine has taken down levees on two of the largest islands of the Danube delta, Ermakov and Tataru, allowing spring flooding and the return of birdlife and the introduction of free-roaming cattle.

“Until recently, the model for our engineers was to have straight rivers,” says Gheorghe Constantin, director of water resources in Romania, another Danube nation. “We kept building levees right up to 2006, when there were huge floods on the Danube. The levees broke. So we decided to leave more space for the river. It was a new model, taken from the Netherlands.”

So what, in practice, is meant by river restoration?

In some urban areas, it can mean simply taking some forgotten stream out of a sewer pipe or concrete culvert. In northwest England, the Environment Agency, a government body, is bringing back into the light the Irwell and Medlock, both of which run through Manchester, once the world’s first great industrial city.

Progress is slower In London. Take a trip on the city’s Underground to Sloane Square station and you will find, hanging above the platform, a large green metal conduit that carries what remains of the River Westbourne on its way to the River Thames. London has 20 other lost rivers, including the Westbourne, Fleet, and Tyburn. In Belgium, the Zenne River through Brussels has been a covered sewer for centuries.

Cleaning up famously filthy rivers remains a challenge. “We have been to hell and back on the Thames,” says Alastair Driver, of the Environment Agency in England, which has been in charge of the river for two decades. New sewage treatment works brought salmon and other fish back to the tidal Thames, but a growing city population and slow investment have recently put things into reverse. “The river is becoming dirtier again,” Driver says. “Around 40 million tons of untreated sewage still goes into the river each year. For a few days a year, it becomes disastrous. You can see sewage in the river for 10 kilometers upstream of London Bridge.”

Restoring rivers requires recreating old channels and meanders and revegetating banks.

After cleaning pollution, bringing back natural flows is next on the restoration checklist. Europe’s water demands on rivers are not so great that they generally run dry. But disruption to their natural hydrology is intense. Dams, weirs, and other barriers proliferate, disrupting fish migrations and changing river flows. Hans Bruyninckx, director of the European Environment Agency, says his agency has counted half a million man-made barriers across rivers in Europe. “That is one every two kilometres.”

Restoring rivers also requires recreating old channels and meanders, revegetating banks, and reconnecting rivers with their floodplains. The task is huge. Northern Sweden may appear unpopulated and largely untouched by humans. But, in fact, foresters there straightened and cleared vegetation on huge numbers of rivers between the 1850s and 1970s, so their logs could be floated downstream to ports.

Now those Swedish rivers are being restored. The main technique is dumping trees in the river. “We need large structures — they are very important for slowing down water and trapping organic material,” says Johanna Gardestrom, an ecologist at Umea University. “The trees are also food for aquatic insects, which in turn are food for fish.”

Another benefit of putting trees back is to keep rivers cool. “Salmon and brown trout die if water temperatures stay above 22 degrees [Celsius] for over seven days,” says Rachel Lenane of Britain’s Environment Agency. “With climate change, we are seeing those conditions in southern England now. But trees can cut two degrees off water temperatures, and up to five degrees if there is full cover.”

One of the last free-flowing stretches of the upper Danube, between Vienna and Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, is managed by a new Austrian national park where wardens are restoring lost side channels of the river, as well as riverine forests. “We want to end the fortification of the Danube,” said Carl Manzano of the Donau-Auen park authority. “We are taking away concrete and rip-rap so the river can recreate its natural bank. 50,000 cubic meters of stone structures have come down. Kingfishers are returning, and wild bees and birds like the little ring plover.”

Everywhere Europe’s river restorers face practical limits on what they can achieve.

But, he admits, full restoration would require much more. Naturally, the river would be braided here, with many channels, he says. But “we have to accept” that may never come back. And hydroelectric dams upstream have lowered the river’s average water level by half a meter since the 1980s.

Everywhere Europe’s river restorers face practical limits on what they can achieve. Ulrich Pulg of Uni Research in Bergen, Norway, estimates that 50 percent of rivers in Germany, 30 percent in Norway and 70 percent in Belgium can never have their ecosystem processes restored. Whole cities would have to move. So the challenge is often to recreate rivers that recognize humanity’s needs.

But while the restorers work out what they can achieve in some areas, they are losing ground in others. Ill-advised engineering projects continue. And to the restorers’ frustration, some are being carried out in the name of the environment.

For example, to fight climate change, hydroelectric power generation is making a comeback in Europe. It is seen by some as the solution to low-carbon energy generation. Sweden already gets more than 40 percent of its power that way, Austria 60 percent, and Norway more than 90 percent.

The latest craze is for small-scale hydro plants, without dams — hundreds of them. The presumption among policymakers is that with no large dams these “run-of-river” schemes have no ecological impact. But Klement Tockner, of the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology in Berlin, warns that their cumulative impact on river flows, as water is diverted through turbines, is becoming significant. “We are seeing huge numbers of small hydropower plants affecting lots of free-flowing rivers, but not delivering much power,” he complains.

Most alarming of all, engineers in some countries continue to propose pouring more concrete and chopping down more trees to upgrade flood defenses and protect against coming climate change.

Such is the story in Poland today, where the conservation group WWF has recently revealed a potent mix of European funding and old Stalinist engineering habits that is creating an environmental disaster. Across Poland in the past five years, some 16,000 kilometers of small rural rivers have been “improved” by engineers. Often using EU development money, the rivers have been straightened, fitted with artificial banks, cleared of vegetation, and diverted in the name of flood protection. This “rehabilitation” work has occurred on one third of the nation’s rivers.

The results of this throwback to past engineering practices are often disastrous and rarely of any flood protection benefit, says WWF’s Przemysław Nawrocki. He has published a poster that reads: “Poland will soon be the perfect site for river restoration…because most of its rivers will be destroyed.”

That’s the trouble with river restoration. It is, of course, valuable work. But first you have to destroy your river.

The announcement crowns a year of courting by Abe, who has visited all 10 countries in the grouping at least once since he came to power last year, always with one eye on wresting back influence in the region from China.

“Together with Asean, I want to build the future of Asia where laws, rather than power, rule, and people who worked hard will be rewarded — which would lead to a prosperous society with mutual respect.”

That apparently was an oblique reference to his country’s fractious spat over the sovereignty of a small chain of islands in the East China Sea, where Japan is keen to garner support for its view that Beijing’s behaviour is aggressive and coercive.

The case has taken on a greater urgency since China’s declaration last month of an Air Defence Identification Zone (Adiz) over the East China Sea - including the contested archipelago.

Beijing said all aircraft entering the zone have to submit flight plans and obey orders issued by Chinese authorities, in an announcement that was widely criticised as inflammatory.

That came after more than 12 months of confrontations between Japanese and Chinese coastguards in the seas near the islands, as well as forays by military and paramilitary planes, and shows of strength by naval vessels.

Some fear the Adiz in the East China Sea is a forerunner to a similar zone in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost entirely.

Abe said on Saturday that the 2 trillion yen ($20 billion) in loans and grants is part of a bigger relationship.

“In this summit, I would like to discuss relations between Japan and Asean in the context of not only our bilateral relations, but also in the context of the international community.

“I hope we will adopt a mid- to long-term vision that would define the way Japan and Asean cooperate in the future.”

On Friday, Tokyo boosted currency swap deals with Indonesia and the Philippines, as well as renewing one with Singapore.

The deals give governments room to manoeuvre in times of economic stress because they can be tapped as a supply of liquid assets — usually US dollars — if normal currency markets seize up.

Japanese diplomats have pushed hard for the joint communique due at the end of the meeting to be a relatively forceful statement on the importance of freedom of navigation on the seas and in the air.

Although unlikely to make any explicit reference to China, any such statement could be viewed as an implicit criticism.

Observers say Japan will find a reasonably willing audience among the four members of Asean who have their own territorial disputes with China — the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei.

But all 10 members of the bloc, which also includes Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore and Thailand, have to tread a fine line to avoid irritating China, whose vast economy is vital to the region.

That point was underlined by Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono ahead of his meeting with Abe on Friday, when he said disagreements in Northeast Asia are “pertinent” for the rest of the continent.

“In particular, it must be said that good relations between China and Japan are critical to the future of our region,” he said.

Abe’s charm offensive has also been aimed at drumming up business for Japan’s infrastructure-makers, with the prime minister keen to boost exports and help give the domestic economy a kick after years of lassitude.","Sat, 14 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2013/12/14/1_16a080ff9c9.1267071_3280167359_16a080ff9c9_medium.jpg,"['zone', 'east', 'row', '20b', 'members', 'relations', 'japan', 'pledge', 'asia', 'backing', 'sea', 'chinawith', 'asean', 'abe', 'seeks', 'china']",

The four, all of whom are serving life terms without a release date, have applied three times to have their sentences cut to 20 years. But they have been told recently that the Indonesian corrections office may not make a decision until next August because of a ""backlog of applications"".

One of the four, Martin Stephens, told Fairfax Media he would be ""upset if the bad relations between Australia and Indonesia was affecting my case"".

Stephens, Matthew Norman, Si Yi Chen and Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen all applied last May for the sentence reduction which, in the Indonesian system, is usually a straightforward process. Prison authorities at both the Kerobokan prison and provincial bureaucrats in Bali found in their favour, but the four were disappointed last August when they were not granted the reduction.

There was no explanation at the time, and they have been waiting since then for concrete news. The Australian consulate has recently told them that the application had not been rejected, but that the corrections office had been ""overwhelmed by applications and had not got around to processing them"".

The decision is likely to be made next August - a year after the four had expected it - with no certainty that the sentence reduction would be granted.

Stephens expressed his frustration, telling Fairfax Media ""we need something to look to the future with, something to give us hope"".

""I'm married but ... I've got to have more than just family to live for, to survive in this place. I need a release date ... I've been here for [almost] 10 years. What have I got to live for? To look forward to? What's the point of anything?""

Stephens, Norman, Nguyen and Chen first applied in 2011, but their bids were stopped with all other remission requests because of a riot at Kerobokan in January 2012. Their second application was rejected because of a new central government regulation that threw all drug cases into doubt. The third application has now also been delayed indefinitely.

As well as expressions of remorse and willingness to cooperate with authorities, the applications include letters showing support from family members, prison guards and other prison officials.

If the sentence reduction application is successful, the new sentences will be 20 years. With the almost nine years they have already spent in Kerobokan prison taken into account, they would have only 11 years left to serve.

Remissions for good behaviour - which in Indonesia are handed out twice a year - could reduce this further so that their likely release date would be 2021 or 2022.

The Bali Nine were convicted in 2005 of attempting to traffic 8.3 kilograms of heroin from Bali to Australia. Two of them, Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, still face death sentences and have appealed to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono for clemency.

There is fear that the current bad state of the relationship between Australia and Indonesia may also affect the death row clemency applications.

Renae Lawrence is serving a 20 year sentence. Even though she was moved out of Kerobokan recently after being accused of plotting to kill a guard at Kerobokan, prison authorities have recommended she receive two months' sentence remission in December.

The others Bali Nine members are also serving life. Michael Czugaj is appealing his sentence, and Scott Rush has exhausted his appeals, and has not yet lodged a bid for sentence remission.","Thu, 19 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://static2.stuff.co.nz/1387422038/712/9332712.jpg,"['bali', 'sentence', 'kerobokan', 'application', 'applications', 'told', 'delay', 'prison', 'authorities', 'serving', 'sentences', 'remission']", 
15,15,FL-2013-000155-IDN,Improving Women's Odds in Disasters - World Bank Group,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/12/12/improving-women-disasters,"Fatema Begum heard the warning to evacuate as Cyclone Sidr bore down on Bangladesh’s southwestern coast in 2007. But she didn’t leave until her home began to fill with water. The nearest shelter was only five meters away, but in the darkness and surging water, that short distance felt like five kilometers. She struggled with two young children in tow, eventually arriving soaked and lucky to be alive.

Begum recently described her ordeal to researchers trying to find out how to improve women’s odds in one of the most disaster-prone countries on earth – and where women have died in far greater numbers than men.

Her story and several others are captured in a new documentary and survey for the World Bank and its fund for the poorest countries, the International Development Association (IDA). The survey inventories cyclone shelters and provides fresh data on the state of emergency preparedness in some of the most vulnerable regions of Bangladesh.

One of its chief aims is to gather evidence on how gender factors into disaster risk and response.

“Bangladesh has made a huge investment in disaster risk management, and it’s saving lives,” says Sabah Moyeen, the World Bank social development specialist leading the effort. “But weaving gender into all aspects of disaster planning and recovery could save more lives.”

In 1970, before early warning systems and storm tracking by satellite, the huge Bhola Cyclone claimed an estimated 300,000 victims in Bangladesh. One of the most striking things about the storm was that women victims outnumbered men 14 to 1.

Cyclone Sidr some 37 years later was as powerful, but casualties fell to about 3,500. The ratio of female to male deaths dropped to 5 to 1.

Between the two storms, Bangladesh had become a model in disaster preparedness. Some 3,500 cyclone shelters were built with the help of partners, including IDA, and more are on the way through the Cyclone Emergency Restoration Project, supported by IDA, and other initiatives. The government joined forces with the Red Crescent Society to develop the cyclone preparedness program and an early warning system.

One of the most effective strategies was involving women, say disaster risk experts. Most women were home-based, responsible for children and elders, and culturally and socially isolated. They died in cyclones because they did not hear warnings, or because they had to fend for others as well as themselves. Many would not evacuate without their husband or another male to accompany them.

Bangladesh tapped women as preparedness champions and made separate spaces in shelters for women and children. Women more readily left their homes after hearing other women calling for people to evacuate. But barriers remain. In recent surveys, women perceived shelters as insecure places where they would have to sacrifice their privacy, and husbands saw them as places they did not want to bring their wives.

Begum said her local shelter lacked drinking water and toilets – two things she considered essential. There was no light to guide her on her short journey. Once at the shelter, she had to stand with her children in a crowded room with men.","Thu, 12 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/share-logo/social-share.jpg,"['water', 'shelter', 'improving', 'cyclone', 'disasters', 'womens', 'shelters', 'children', 'women', 'warning', 'risk', 'disaster', 'odds', 'preparedness']", 
16,16,FL-2013-000155-IDN,Global water scarcity predicted to rise by 40% | News - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/global-water-scarcity-predicted-rise-40/,"Global water scarcity already on the rise due to exploding global populations may be amplified by up to 40 per cent due to climate change.

Research carried out by the German-based Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research has found significantly more people throughout the world will struggle to find the water needed for the basics of life as the planet warms.

Modelling for the study suggested the spread of water scarcity could be intensified by 40 per cent across the planet as a result of global warming, and in some scenarios could be more than 100 per cent.

As a result the institute projects that between five and 20 per cent of the world’s population may face “absolute” water scarcity as the climate changes. How far water scarcity will extend will depend on the rate of population growth and warming.

The findings are the result of a comprehensive study, produced in collaboration with research groups around the world, using 11 hydrological models driven by five climate models.

The study found changes in water availability would not be uniform worldwide or within countries. Western and southern Australia were projected to see a decline in water availability while the north may see a significant increase.

Elsewhere, areas expected to see an increase included eastern Africa, the Indian peninsula and high northern latitudes. Southern China, the Middle East and southern US would experience a decrease.

The figures examined the impact from a two degree rise in average global temperatures compared to current levels. The latest report by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found a high confidence in the global surface temperature exceeding a 1.5 degrees increase, compared to the average from years 1850 to 1900.

The Potsdam study found that up to 15 per cent of the world’s population would see “increases exceeding 100 per cent of today’s discharge” of water.

The researchers noted that while these increases might often improve water availability, they carry the risk of increased flooding, damage to infrastructure and declining water quality.

Water scarcity was divided into two classes: annual “blue” water availability below 500 cubic metres per capita – described as absolute water scarcity – and annual availability below 1000 cubic metes per capita – described as chronic water scarcity.

The researchers suggested that 1.5 per cent of the global population currently falls into the absolute water scarcity category, and 3 per cent faces chronic water scarcity.

Co-author Pavel Kabat, of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, said: “From a risk management perspective, it becomes very clear that, if human-made climate change continues, we are putting at risk the very basis of life for millions of people, even according to the more optimistic scenarios and models.”

The study was published in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.","Thu, 19 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://eco-business.imgix.net/uploads/ebmedia/fileuploads/shutterstock_133293578.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,"['water', 'rise', 'global', 'scarcity', 'climate', 'availability', '40', 'population', 'southern', 'risk', 'predicted', 'study', 'cent']",

The 107cm gun was found at Dundee beach during an unusually low tide

Historians believe Indonesian sailors lost the weapon two centuries ago

'This may be one of the earliest historical artefacts found in northern Australia,’ Dr Matt Cupper told MailOnline

The discovery of a 250-year old Indonesian swivel gun in Australia could add another chapter to the country's history.

The weapon was found on a remote Northern Territory beach after it had laid on the seabed for over two centuries.

Scientists claim the gun could be evidence of a previously unknown foreign explorer on Australian shores before Captain Cook landed in 1770.

The discovery of a 250-year old swivel gun in Australia could add another chapter to the country's history. The weapon was found on a remote Northern Territory beach in 2010 had been lying on the seabed for over two centuries

A local boy, Christopher Doukas, found the 107cm-long artillery gun buried in the sand of Dundee beach in 2010 during an unusually low tide.

Australian scientist Tim Stone told the Australian Press Agency that this was ‘one of the most significant historical artefacts ever found in northern Australia.’

Historians first thought the gun may have been much older, initially suggesting it could belong to 16th century seafarers from Portugal.

The Past Masters, a multidisciplinary team that explores historic mysteries, now believe sailors from Indonesia lost the gun around 250 years ago.

Matt Cupper from the University of Melbourne has been analysing the weapon by removing sediment from within the gun barrel before using optical methods to find out its age

COINS SUGGEST AUSTRALIA WAS FOUND SIX CENTURIES EARLIER

As well as the swivel gun, five African coins that scientists believe could be up to 1000 years old were found on the Wessel Islands in 1944. The coins were discovered hidden in the sand by soldier Maurie Isenberg who was stationed on the islands during World War II. At the time of the discovery, Isenberg also found four coins that came from the Dutch East India Company, dating back to 1690. Scientists say this supports claims that Dutch explorers discovered the island before Captain James Cook in 1770. Indiana University’s Professor Ian McIntosh said the copper coins were the first coins to ever be produced in sub-Saharan Africa. They have only been found outside of Africa twice. He believes that the coins may indicate that there were maritime trading routes connecting east Africa, Arabia, India and the Spice Islands over 1,000 years ago - much earlier than first thought. If this theory is proved correct it will mean that other civilisations discovered and made contact with Australia six centuries before the Europeans.



This places the gun at the start of the Macassan trepan - also known as the sea cucumber trade.



Researchers believe it could have been lost by an Indonesian vessel that was blown off course.

Matt Cupper from the University of Melbourne has been analysing the weapon by removing sediment from within the gun barrel before using optical methods to uncover its age.

He agrees with the analysis that the gun dates back 250 years.

Further metal analysis tests are being undertaken to determine the source of the bronze used to cast the gun.

‘The Dundee Beach swivel gun is important because it may be one of the earliest historical artefacts found in northern Australia,’ Dr Cupper told MailOnline.

‘It is also evidence of outside contact with Australia that may predate the first British arrivals on the continent.’

Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon was the first European to have reached Australian shores in 1606.

He is known to have been followed by fellow Dutch seafarer Dirk Hartog a few years later.

But a number of finds in recent years suggests that Australia may have other explorers it needs to add to its history.

The average water quality of the Huangpu River was at third and fourth levels, making it difficult to meet the national standard for tap water resources, a senior official with the Shanghai Water Authority said yesterday.

Some sections of the river even touched the worst fifth level with its deteriorating ammonia and nitrogen amounts, he told local legislative body at a meeting yesterday.

“The upstream Huangpu River is a major river channel for Shanghai and neighboring Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces with some 700,000 ships passing through every year that impact the water quality,” the official said.

The city’s Qingpu, Jinshan, Songjiang, Minhang and Fengxian districts still take water from the upstream Huangpu River. Most downtown districts get water from the Yangtze River that has better water quality.

To ensure water safety for the districts, authorities will begin building a small reservoir on the Taipu River to supply water to the five districts. The new reservoir, covering some 2 square kilometers on north Taipu River, can store some 5 million cubic meters of water.

When the water quality worsens on the Huangpu River, the reservoir can supply tap water to residents in the five districts for three days.

Meanwhile, a 44-kilometer-long pipeline, with pipes 4 meters in diameter, will be built to link six different water intakes along the upstream Huangpu River which can be closed during water pollution. Construction of the reservoir and pipeline systems will cost 7 billion yuan (US$1.15 billion) and should be ready by 2017.

Since the Qingcaosha Reservoir went into operation in 2011, Shanghai has been altering its water supply structure.

By the end of 2015, 70 percent of the city’s drinking water will be provided by the Yangtze’s Qingcaosha and Chenghang reservoirs.

Huangpu will only contribute the rest 30 percent of tap water.

However, the city government is still developing more water resources after a study conducted by a local political advisory body warned that Shanghai may face water shortages if the population continues to soar.","Wed, 11 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://eco-business.imgix.net/uploads/ebmedia/fileuploads/shutterstock_159129161.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,"['water', 'upstream', 'supply', 'river', 'huangpu', 'shanghai', 'suburbs', 'quality', 'districts', 'scare', 'tap', 'reservoir']",

If that continues, everyone will pay.

Along the eastern seaboard of Australia, where most of us live, state governments are relaxing their policies and largely leaving it to local councils to decide if homes can be built in low-lying areas.

The Queensland government confirmed this week that sea level rise will be removed from its State Planning Policy, just as it was in New South Wales a year ago, while Victoria has also relaxed its sea level rules.

Yet nearly 39,000 homes are already located within 110 metres of soft, erodible shorelines, according to the Australian Department of Environment, which states exposure to the effects of sea level rise “will increase as Australia’s population grows”.

With 85% of Australians living in coastal areas, and billions of dollars of buildings and roads at stake, if we don’t get coastal planning right we risk facing huge human and economic costs.

The Local Government Association of Queensland has warned that councils could be sent broke by the state policy change, particularly because of the legal liability they could face if they approve coastal developments that are subsequently hit by future storm damage or flooding.

And as we saw with the devastating Queensland floods of 2011 and other major disasters, when individual homeowners were not insured and needed help, or when individual councils can’t afford to fix damaged roads and infrastructure, who ends up footing much of the repair bill? All Australian taxpayers.

So this is not just a problem for the lucky few with homes by the beach: we all have something at stake in getting coastal protections right.

Sea level rise science

As the Department of Environment explains, the risks from rising sea levels are serious, and not limited just to the coast:

Australian Bureau of Statistics

Rising sea levels will increase the frequency or likelihood of extreme sea level events and resultant flooding. The risks from sea level rise are not confined to the coast itself. In many cases flooding may impact areas some distance from the sea for example along estuaries, rivers, lakes and lagoons. A study of 29 locations in Australia found that for a mid-range sea level rise of 50cm, extreme sea level events that happened every few years now are likely to occur every few days in 2100. On average, Australia will experience a roughly 300-fold increase in flooding events, meaning that infrastructure that is presently flooded once in 100 years will be flooded several times per year with a sea level rise of 50cm.

But when you consider that many homes and suburbs that we build in Australia today will still be standing for decades to come, and that we don’t want to see those home owners left out of pocket or suing their council for letting them build in low-lying areas - just how much sea level rise should we be planning for?

I asked Dr John Church, a CSIRO Fellow and a coordinating lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change chapter on sea level, what the latest science indicated. He replied:

The science is clear. Historical sea level information around the world and in Australia tells us that in times of a warmer climate, sea level has been metres higher than at present and that the rate of sea level rise has increased since pre-industrial time. The emission of greenhouse gases has been a significant contribution to the 20th century rise and will very likely result in a faster rate of rise during the 21st century than over the last 40 years, or the 20th century as a whole. Projections for sea level rise around Australia are similar to the global average. If there was very significant mitigation of greenhouses gas emissions, the global average rise is projected to be 28cm to 61cm by 2100, but, if emissions continue to grow in a business as usual fashion as is happening at present, the rise is projected to be 52cm to 98cm, and possibly up to several tens of centimetres above these values if marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet collapse. Sea level will continue to rise well after 2100. - John Church, correspondence with the author, 9 December 2013.

Queensland’s old planning rules had factored in a sea level rise of 30 centimetres by 2050 and 80 centimetres by 2100. That meant that coastal development in such hazard areas was generally only permitted in special circumstances, such as for marine and fishing precincts .

As Dr Church and the Australian government’s sea level site both indicate, on current trends 80cm is within the range of business as usual projections.

A 2011 report by the Australian government found that more than A$226 billion worth of Australian homes, offices blocks, roads, rail and other built infrastructure would be potentially flooded or eroded with a sea level rise of 1.1 metres, which is the high end scenario they examined for 2100.

Ironically, of all Australian states, that report found Queensland faced the greatest combined risk from high tides and storm surges, and the costs they would face to replace damaged infrastructure. (The state-by-state cost estimates are shown below.)

Climate Change Risks to Coastal Buildings and Infrastructure, Australian Government, 2011

A national response to a national problem

In the two short years since that report was published, we have gone from a situation where all Australian governments were working together on a national approach to coastal planning, under the former National Coasts and Climate Change Council, to a trend towards dumping the risks and liabilities for coastal planning onto local councils.

This is already leaving some communities very exposed to rising costs. For instance, the Gold Coast is already hit by beach erosion costing tens of millions of dollars to remedy, and even greater costs could be incurred with further seawater intrusion and damage to infrastructure, such as storm water networks.

www.shutterstock.com/Steven Bostock

Yet there is plenty of evidence to show why protecting coastal areas is the sensible option, and how to do it.

Over the past 50 years, there have been 25 national inquiries and reports into coastal management, including a comprehensive 396-page 2009 Coasts and Climate Change federal parliamentary report. Those inquiries have overwhelmingly come to the conclusion that rather than leaving it to local councils, we need one set of clear, national guidelines on coastal development and infrastructure.

That’s the opposite of what we’re now seeing around Australia, with a mish-mash of different rules in different states.

All of which increases the risk of more development in areas at risk of coastal erosion, sea level rise and storm surges. Unless this changes, who’ll pay the price for this lack of foresight and planning? If you’re an Australian taxpayer, you will, and in the future so will your children.","Tue, 10 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/37276/original/y3jpf7qj-1386630846.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['rise', 'coastal', 'planning', 'puts', 'homes', 'change', 'scrapping', 'national', 'infrastructure', 'sea', 'protection', 'level', 'australian', 'risk', 'australia']",

This girl, 13-year-old Saiba Khatun spends her day at the relief camp under a tent that is flooded and breeds insects and illness, waiting for her parents to return with some food and the hope of good news.



But, as the Mail Today team which visited the Loee camp found, both are tough to come by.

In another tent close by, Irfana Khatun has been unwell since the second week of September, when she along with her family fled Muzaffarnagar's riot-hit Fugana village and took shelter the Loee refuge camp.



The 30-year-old was pregnant at that time but she couldn't dare to go to a doctor outside the camp for fear of being killed by rioters.

On November 21, she gave birth to a girl with the help of other refugee women.

The newborn child couldn't bear the brunt of UP government's apathy and the winter cold and died two days later.



A team of doctors visited her for the first time on December 7 after reports of deaths of over 40 children in different relief camps of Muzaffarnagar and Shamli because of the lack of health services and cold weather.



The medical team gave Irfana 10 tablets of paracetamol and suggested that she return home.



""They scolded me for living in the relief camp and said I was not entitled to any financial assistance because my husband didn't have a ration card. They measured my body temperature and gave me some tablets. But I am still ill,"" she told Mail Today on Friday.



Water-logged



When Mail Today visited her, a foul smell in her tent suggested that it had not been cleaned for the many weeks.



Yet, only two days ago, CM Akhilesh Yadav's report on the state of riot relief camps made it sound like all was rosy.



Yadav had claimed that ""perfect arrangements"" had been made at relief camps for the families displaced after communal violence in Muzaffarnagar and adjoining districts.

Children often have to go with very little food in the relief camps

Also, in a report submitted to the government recently, Saharanpur Commissioner Bhuvnesh Kumar noted that clean drinking water and proper medical care had been made available to the families living in the relief camps.



The Mail Today team saw the entire area was water-logged after unexpected rains last week.



The temporary sewer lines were open and toilets overflowing.



While a piped waterline has been installed in the area, there are no fixed timings for water supply, the families complained they couldn't drink the water because it smells foul.



""Now doctors visit and scold me every day. But they didn't come here in November to save my child. Government officials also come here to tell me that either I should return to Fugana or they would throw me and my children in the Loee canal,"" alleged Irfana, who has four children.

Her husband, Yaqoob Shaikh, frequently visits district collectorate to claim government's financial assistance.

Unhygenic conditions are a way of life in Loee camp

There are about 450 refugee families, comprising 3,500 individuals, who are still living in the Loee camp.



Their stories are the same.



According to an estimate, over three dozen people are currently suffering from high fever. Doctors have given them only paracetamol. Mehrana alias Tabassum (15) is also in fever for one month. While her parents went to the town on Friday to arrange for food, she was left behind to erect their fallen tent.



""Our tent falls every day. Last night, there was drizzle and we all stood outside because the tent was leaking and then fell on the ground. I catch cold frequently,"" she said.



Sharda Khatoon said fear still looms large and they cannot dare to return home.

“I often speak with women farmers around the world, and if I ask them what’s going on with climate change in their area, they give a puzzled look as if to say: ‘What does that mean?’” said Susan Carlson, chair of the World Farmers’ Organization (WFO) women’s committee.

“But the minute I ask them: ‘Has your weather changed?’ then I receive exuding responses.”

For example, the lack of a local forecasting or weather alert system for farmers in Zambia is emblematic of the great gaps that exist between the global research and development agenda and the farmer community, she said.

Women farmers in developing countries often face economic difficulties in part because they lack access to technology and technological know-how that can help them adapt to climate change, said Carlson, formerly a dairy farmer in the state of Wisconsin who now farms in the state of North Dakota in the northern United States with her husband, Robert.

At the global level, U.N. climate talks tend to be dominated by politicians, researchers, scientists, professors and academic scholars — there could be up to 600 people in a room making decisions for farmers, and yet they don’t really know what we need, Carlson said.

Women produce more than 50 percent of the world’s food, but earn only 10 percent of its income, she said. They own less than 2 percent of property, and receive a disproportionately low percentage of bank loans.

Women want to adapt to new ways of farming, but often lack access to technology and sufficient expertise to find out how they can benefit from it. Their traditional means of weather forecasting for planting and harvesting are no longer working as they once did.

A Zambian farmer told Carlson that she learns about new farm methods or marketing techniques from her credit facilitator when she visits him to take out a loan.

Women often struggle with poor literacy skills, which makes it impossible for them to apply for loans, as farm records are needed to secure credit. Carlson said. “Many need visual, simple explanations,” she added.

Seeking solutions

If one or two women farmers in a given region are shown how to adapt practices on their farms, and it proves successful it will be picked up by other farmers.

Changes in weather patterns have been so drastic in Zambia that the Zambian farmer said she had to move her vegetable production to higher ground as the area traditionally used was being flooded, Carlson said, adding that new insect varieties have also emerged.

Other examples of practices she has adopted to improve her yield include drip irrigation, incorporating manure and organic matter into her soil, reducing tillage, and planting more fruit and nut trees.

“Not only is she adapting to climate change, this Zambian farmer is mitigating the results of climate change by incorporating these practices,” Carlson said.

The difficulty of transporting crops to markets due to poor road conditions, the lack of storage and refrigeration, as well as the lack of capacity to process or preserve perishable crops when they are not sold at market, also make life challenging for many farmers, Carlson said

But with technology transfer, information sharing, and investments in farmers, particularly women farmers, these challenges can be overcome, she said, adding that policymakers, researchers, scientists, professors, academic scholars should listen to what women farmers have to say and respond to their needs while being mindful of their cultures.

“As science and understanding helps increase our knowledge we make changes to better improve our farming systems,” Carlson said.

Expert extension agents should be made available, and farm organizations helmed by women — and individual women — can help provide educational opportunities and empower women.

“We must look at our farms as a whole system not just production-focused and we change our systems as they need adjusting,” she said.

“The bottom line is that everyone wants a profit and farmers are no different. We shouldn’t apologize when we make a profit. To be a commercial farmer is not a bad thing — it comes at a cost, and everyone benefits from the food security we provide — remember, no farmers, no food, no future.”","Tue, 24 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://eco-business.imgix.net/uploads/ebmedia/fileuploads/shutterstock_120755029.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,"['urges', 'climate', 'zambia', 'change', 'range', 'women', 'farmer', 'measures', 'carlson', 'weather', 'lack', 'farmers', 'zambian', 'battling', 'aid']",

Mita Duran, 24, often tweeted about working extremely long hours

She considered getting home before midnight a small victory

She died after working more than a whole day without sleep - her coworkers blamed Thai Red Bull

A young woman literally worked herself to death shortly after bragging online about how long she had been in her office.

Mita Duran, 24, of Jakarta, Indonesia, died after tweeting ’30 hours of work and still going strooong,’ last Saturday night. Coworkers of her’s blamed energy drinks for her death.

It was one of many tweets Mr Duran sent out describing the long hours she worked as a copywriter for WPP-owned Young & Rubicam, an ad agency in the country’s capital.

Zafrul Sjahrial, the stepfather of Pradnya Paramita who died after a 30 hour shift, has defended the advertising industry saying Paramita knew what it took to succeed

Ms Duran was a hard-working, dedicated copywriter, so much so that she wrote on Tumblr about her exhausting workload.

'Tonight, I carry the keys to the office for the eighth day running,’ she lamented. ‘I’m still here. I have no life. Someone please take me out for drinks, kicks and giggles.’

The determined 24-year-old also made frequent posts to Twitter about her long hours.

‘Home before midnight after three long, exhausting weeks. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED,’ the overworked woman tweeted November 18.



A few days earlier she showed signs she was having trouble keeping up with the demands of her bosses.

Paramita, who went under the name Mita Diran on Twitter, frequently posted about her long hours online and collapsed while having dinner with friends just hours after this message

Paramita worked for advertising agency Young & Rubicam whose clients include Dell and Xerox

The copy writer slipped into a coma late on Saturday night and was pronounced dead on Sunday

Sjahrial said her tweets showed she was passionate about her job and was 'a girl ready for the next step'

‘Sweetest sleep I've had in a long time. It's a shame I'm supposed to wake up uh, ONE HOUR earlier. Slept through 3 phone calls and 3 alarms!’ She tweeted November 14.

That might have been a result of the long hours she worked the prior week.

‘Alright, one full week of going home past 2am from the office. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we just broke a record,’ Ms Diran tweeted November 8.

She also pondered sleeping in the office.

‘The more you spend time at the office, the more you consider moving your bed here. Preferably next to the fan. #AgencyLife,’ Ms Diran tweeted October 29.

Sjahrial, an advertising creative director with 35 years' experience, said long hours were expected

Energy drink: A friend of Duran's later wrote ‘She died because too much of overtime working, and too much kratingdaeng attacks her heart.’ Krating Daeng is the name for Red Bull in Thailand, where the original version of the energy drink comes from



Sjahrial confirmed that he would not be pressing charges against the company saying that if people wanted somebody to blame, they should blame the entire industry

The copyrighter’s mother took to Path before her death to tell of her heartache - a posting noted by BuzzFeed.

‘Hi everyone, since last night and until now my daughter who is a copyrighter in Y&R lay in coma in RSPP,’ Yani Syahial wrote.

‘Chances not very good. She collapsed after continuous working overtime for 3 days last night,’ she continued. ‘Working over the limit. I have not slept since then.’

Ms Diran died within the hour.

‘An hour after this msg [sic]… her daughter died,’ Shalini wrote in a comment to the original post. ‘She died because too much of overtime working, and too much kratingdaeng attacks her heart.’

‘May she rest in peace.’

Stepfather also said reports of continuous 30-hour shift were 'overblown' saying there must have been breaks for food or opportunities to walk around the office

Kratingdaeng is Thai for Red Bull, where the original version of the energy drink comes from.

Ms Diran tweeted at least once about staying up all night working with help from the energy drink.

‘Spent half the night writing copy and finishing up a 23-page deck with a glass of vodka/red bull mix and now I can't sleep. SO BEAR WITH ME.

Y&R posted on its Facebook page about the death. After expressing condolences and wishing their dead employee’s family well, they announced the office would close this week in order to give employees time to grieve - for one day.

Shalini had one final plea.","Thu, 19 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/18/article-2525584-1A2B2CB800000578-925_636x382.jpg,"['diran', 'dies', 'tweeting', 'working', 'tweeted', 'hours', 'night', 'office', '30', 'energy', 'died', 'blamed', 'drinks', 'worked', 'long', 'copywriter']",

In addition to cold and hunger, people could die from fires caused by makeshift stoves. Yesterday, a one-year-old child died in a fire in a refugee camp in southern Lebanon. Caritas calls on people to remember at Christmas Syria's more than 1.3 million war refugees.

Beirut (AsiaNews) - ""The situation in the Bekaa Valley is terrible,"" said Mgr Simon Faddoul, president of Caritas Lebanon. ""Many people are dying because of the exceptionally cold weather. Refugees have only tents and shacks to protect themselves from the cold and the snow.""

Now, the more than 800,000 Syrian refugees stranded in camps on the border with Syria are having to cope with Alexa, an intense storm that has battered the Middle East with snow and rain, causing whiteout conditions and floods across the region.

""Together with other non-governmental organisations and the United Nations, Caritas has tried to help refugees,"" Mgr Faddoul said. ""In recent weeks, we have handed out thousands of blankets, mattresses, kerosene heaters, winter clothing, plastic sheeting and fuel coupons in the hope of averting the worst, but our efforts are not enough. There is a daily exodus (from Syria) and the number of people who cross the border is now huge.""

In view of the situation, the clergyman has urged Western countries and all Christians to send money and aid to the Syrian people.

In the Bekaa Valley alone, there are about 430 makeshift camps. Better off families have been able to build huts using wooden planks, jute bags and metal sheets, which have become a luxury item.

Meanwhile, the latest arrivals have tried to find shelter with other families, but the huts are small and families are big. For many people, the only alternative is sleeping in tents made ​​of plastic sheeting, cardboard, tires and other junk.

For Mgr Faddoul, winter this year has turned an already serious humanitarian situation into a catastrophe for the refugees.

""Mothers are trying to keep their children warm by building bonfires inside the huts. This is highly risky. Last night, in a camp in southern Lebanon, a small fire spread from one hut to the entire camp, killing a one-year-old baby, and injuring a number of people. Such accidents can happen any day.""

An ""emergency of this kind can only be met with the charity,"" the priest said, ""by giving aid and remembering, especially at Christmas, the fate of hundreds of thousands of people who lost family and home in the past three years and are now in danger of dying from cold and hunger.""

Yet, in spite of the serious situation, many refugee families, Muslims and Christians, are preparing for Christmas. To help them, Caritas is organising a number of activities over the next few days for the children living in the refugee camps.

""With the help of our volunteers, we are preparing games and carols to bring a little hope and joy, at least for the little ones,"" Mgr Faddoul said.","Mon, 16 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/SIRIA_(f)_1216_-_Rifugiati_inverno.jpg,"['refugee', 'families', 'valley', 'thousands', 'snow', 'refugees', 'faddoul', 'lebanon', 'caritas', 'mgr', 'syrian', 'cold', 'situation', 'die']",

As its name suggests, the plan seeks to create a healthier food environment for local people.

Acknowledging the multiple domains of influence on food choice, the initiative is aimed at promoting food environments supportive of healthy choices and to enhance the skills and resources of people to make best use of those environments.

Understanding the food environment

We’re exposed to a vast range of food stores, products, advertisements and other promotions every day. In fact, on a typical day, we have access to food stores near our home as well as near our workplace or school and during commutes in between.

Supermarkets are flooded with food promotions. And at sporting venues and events, food is prominent through stalls, advertising, and sponsorship. Fundraising efforts for schools and community groups involve the sale of food items, and food and beverage advertisements dominate commercial television breaks.

Of these seemingly endless exposures to food over the course of a typical week, how many are to healthy food? Very few, in most places. Most people, most of the time, are exposed to a disproportionate number of unhealthy foods on a regular basis.

This exposure to food constitutes our food environment.

The food environment doesn’t force us to make unhealthy choices, but unbalanced and repeated exposure to unhealthy food is likely to influence food purchasing decisions.

We are all influenced by the fact that the unhealthy choice has become the easy choice in our society. Indeed, researchers have observed higher rates of obesity in people who have greater access to unhealthy food, such as what is commonly sold in fast-food stores.

While much of the research in this area to date has been concerned with residential neighbourhoods, it’s increasingly recognised that factors in other places where we spend our time may also be important. We now know that the availability of fresh fruit near workplaces, for instance, may encourage consumption of these items.

What’s the plan?

The ACT government initiative represents a positive step towards the reversal of the obesity-promoting food environment.

Its plan is to increase the supply and promotion of healthy foods and reduce the supply and promotion of unhealthy foods. Importantly, it appears to recognise that these actions need to be rolled out in a range of environments, including schools and workplaces.

There’s even a plan to enact a mandatory code for supermarkets to have at least one checkout aisle free of energy-dense, nutrient poor-foods. Research shows this is currently rare within Australian supermarkets.

Perhaps the most ambitious part of the proposal is to “explore options” for regulating the sale of sugar-sweetened drinks.

A plan by the mayor of New York to limit the size of sugary drinks sold in the city was rejected earlier this year by courts in the country; a decision applauded by the American Beverage Association.

By proposing to regulate sugar-sweetened drink sales, the ACT government should expect to face similar battles to those faced by New York city.

Knowledge, values and skills also play a key role in food choices, and this is reflected in the plan which includes strategies aimed at improving food-related skills, awareness and capabilities of local people.

Healthy eating education sessions will be provided for people with low income, and those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.

The intention here is to enable people to identify and prepare healthy foods. And research has shown that greater attention to the planning and organising of meals is associated with healthier eating.

In essence, the ACT proposal is aiming to make the healthy choice the easier choice. Opponents are likely to continue to invoke the “nanny state” argument, as objections to such proposals often do.

But the Territory’s goals are based on a solid and ever-growing body of evidence that acknowledges the environment plays a strong role in determining eating behaviours and health.","Thu, 12 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/37556/original/rtwgz9hs-1386818372.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['foods', 'heres', 'food', 'good', 'research', 'skills', 'environment', 'acts', 'healthy', 'choice', 'near', 'plan', 'act', 'unhealthy']",

‘Moral cop' Vasant Dhoble shifted to Mumbai crime branch

Mumbai: Assistant Commissioner of Police Vasant Dhoble, who had hit the headlines for his controversial crackdown against bars and restaurants in the city, was yesterday transferred to the crime branch of the Mumbai police.“Dhoble, who was with the control room of late, has been brought to the crime branch,” a senior police official said.The ACP, who, armed with his trademark hockey stick, raided bars and restaurants which stayed open beyond the permissible time, had invited mixed reactions.The media berated Dhoble for his “high-handed” style and for curtailing the city's night life but residents in the vicinity of bars and pubs welcomed his tough stand.Police Commissioner Satyapal Singh, soon after taking over, had ordered Dhoble to report to the crime branch instead of the Commissioner directly.Two women, detained by a police team led by Dhoble during a raid on restaurant for alleged human trafficking racket, had also dragged him to court, seeking compensation for alleged defamation.But the Bombay High Court refused to pass any directions against the police.Recently the Crime Investigation Department (CID) of the Maharashtra police gave him a clean-chit in a case related to hawker's death during eviction drive of police in Vakola area, which fell under his jurisdiction as ACP. The hawker died of heart attack.

The storm, named Alexa, is expected to last until Saturday, bringing more snow, rain and freezing temperatures to large swaths of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories.



The bad weather, which began on Wednesday, is taking a disproportionate toll on the 2.2 million refugees living outside Syria and the 6.5 million people displaced within the country.



Biting cold and heavy rain beset Zaatari camp, which houses 80,000 of Jordan's more than half a million Syrian refugees.



Among them was Khalil Atma from Sanameen in southern Syria who was shivering with her two daughters in a flooded, unheated trailer. “We have come from one tragedy to another,” she said.



Aid agencies say they are working around the clock to evacuate refugees from flooded camps and distribute food, supplies and clothing, but cannot keep up with demand.



“These people need much more in terms of preparations for winter and organizations are doing their best, but winter conditions are harsh,” said Saba Mobaslat, country director of Save the Children International, which operates in Zaatari.



In Lebanon, more than 835,000 Syrians live in tents, unused buildings or with friends or family. UNICEF said needs were outpacing what it and its partners could provide.



In Turkey, authorities distributed extra blankets and winter clothes to many of the 206,000 Syrian refugees at camps along the border, said Mustafa Aydogdu, spokesman for the prime minister's disaster relief agency AFAD.



Refugees sheltering in 16 tent cities and six container camps were also given oil-generated heating lamps to reduce the risk of fire, Aydogdu said. Snow removal and firefighting teams have been established at the camps.







Despite the weather, shelling and clashes raged on this week in Syria, where rebels have been fighting for more than 2-1/2 years to bring down President Bashar al-Assad.



Images on Twitter showed rebels marching through the snow carrying automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades.



Photographs from the central Syrian city of Homs revealed blocks of houses devastated by two years of street fighting and air strikes, and now covered in a thick layer of snow.



Al Arabiya television on Friday broadcast an image of a child said to have died from exposure in Syria. Reuters could not independently verify the report.



The World Food Program said it was distributing 10,000 liters of fuel for cooking and heating to internally displaced families living in 10 shelters in Damascus.



WFP Syria Director Matthew Hollingworth said many Syrians had fled without enough warm clothes or blankets. “Syria is always quite cold in winter but it is quite different when you face a fierce winter in a shelter with very limited resources rather than in the comfort of your own home,” he said.



The snow also prevented the start of a United Nations airlift to bring relief supplies from Iraq to tens of thousands of people in Syria's remote northeastern Kurdish areas.



A snowstorm of rare intensity blanketed the Jerusalem area and parts of the occupied West Bank, choking off the city and stranding hundreds in vehicles on impassable roads.



Israeli authorities said at least 50 cm (20 inches) of snow had fallen since Thursday and more was forecast through the day.



“In my 54 years I don't remember a sight like this, such an amount I cannot recall,” said Nir Barkat, mayor of Jerusalem.



The Israeli military helped police rescue hundreds of people stranded in vehicles on highways near Jerusalem. More than 500 were given makeshift shelter in a city convention hall.



Highways into the city were shut, with plows impeded by falling snow and freezing cold. Broken tree branches toppled electricity wires leaving tens of thousands without power, Israeli media said. Residents were told to stay at home.



Winter diplomacy



Despite the storm, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Friday to try to spur lagging peace talks. He had met Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank city of Ramallah the day before.



The storm forced Kerry to cut short his session with Abbas to return to Israel before the roads and border-crossings shut.



In the blinding snow, his convoy's path was cleared only by a Palestinian front-end loader whose driver stuck his head out the door to see all the way from Ramallah to the Israeli border where Israeli police escorted Kerry's party back to the hotel.



The usually 45-minute trip took more than two hours.



An unusual blanket of snow surprised residents in the Gaza Strip who stopped to take pictures of snowy scenes. But the Palestinian territory was also hit by heavy rain that flooded roads and made them impassable. Emergency workers used fishing boats to evacuate 700 people from their homes and provide food, blankets and torches to hundreds of others caught in high water.



Gaza's Hamas government said all its resources and manpower were available to aid rescue operations, including its armed wing usually charged with fighting Israel.



Ismail Haniyeh, prime minister of the Hamas administration, called for fuel to be allowed to enter Gaza. “Gaza survived two wars (against Israel) and it will walk out of this,” he said wearing a heavy coat and the yellow jumper of emergency workers as he toured the affected areas overnight.



Fuel shortages in recent weeks have caused Gaza's sole power plant to shut its generators, leaving residents with 12-hour blackouts and disrupting hospitals, sewage treatment facilities and private businesses.



Two days of snowfall in Turkey forced the cancelation of 240 international and domestic flights on Thursday at airports across the country with delays spanning several hours, flag carrier Turkish Airlines said on its website.



The Bosphorus Strait, through which some 10,000 vessels and 150 million tons of oil products pass each year, reopened on Thursday after high winds, strong currents and poor visibility prompted maritime officials to bar tankers the previous day.



Five tankers were waiting to enter at both ends of the strait, shipping agent GAC said.","Fri, 13 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/A821763D-67FA-4AF6-BFFA-15D01B3557CE.jpg,"['city', 'east', 'israeli', 'alexa', 'snow', 'refugees', 'storm', 'winter', 'palestinian', 'middle', 'million', 'chills', 'syria', 'turkey']",

36,36,FL-2013-000155-IDN,A super canal from Scotland to London could help solve water scarcity - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/super-canal-scotland-london-water-scarcity,"The Chancellor's autumn statement earlier this month contained lots of proposals to boost spending on infrastructure but, not surprisingly, canals did not feature highly.

One man thinks it should have. David Weight, associate director at engineering consultants Aecom, has proposed a multi-purpose canal stretching from the Scottish border to the outskirts of London. The waterway could provide a number of sustainability services right along its length.

The main one would be transporting water from the north to the south. The south east of England is both one of the driest and the most populous region in the UK, while eastern England is even drier and its agriculture sector requires lots of water for irrigation. By 2030, the UK needs to produce 50% more food than it does today, according to the government, and we will need 30% more fresh water. In the longer term, the canal could be extended north of the border to give access to Scottish water as well.

""This is a concept that should be looked at seriously,"" added Paul Hammett, national water specialist at the National Farmers Union. ""In the long term, we have a real challenge in finding enough water to be able to continue to grow our food.""

The idea is not new – in 1942 JF Pownall proposed a Grand Contour Canal that would use gravity to transport water from one end of the country to the other, avoiding the need to use expensive and energy-intensive pumping equipment.

Transporting water without the need for pumping is one of the key features of Weight's scheme, and he claims the canal would be more efficient and more resilient than smaller-scale, piecemeal water transfer projects..

Weight acknowledged ""there could be major problems with obstruction, crossings and planning,"" but pointed out that the canal could be used for a number of other purposes, ranging from flood relief to tourism. These include putting a high voltage cable underneath the canal to transport another of Scotland's plentiful resources – renewable energy – to the south east's centres of demand. As well as saving money by providing an alternative to undersea cables, it would also make the cables secure against metal thefts, allow them to be water-cooled, avoid having to put them in the corrosive marine environment and keep the cables out of sight while still having easy access to them, Weight asserted.

The canal could also carry data cables, which would allow data centres to be sited in Scotland where they could make use of the country's wind and hydro-electric power, as well as having to spend less on power to keep their servers cool because of the lower temperatures at higher latitudes.

And with Drax, Britain's largest power station, planning to convert three of its coal-fired generating units to run on biomass, the canal can help there, too. ""It would be ideal for transporting biomass from northern Scotland, where there is a big afforestation programme, to Drax, Eggborough and Ratcliffe on Soar power stations, helping them to cut their emissions,"" Weight said.

The waterway could also act as a conduit for district heating, using waste heat from those same power stations and it could even help to reduce flooding by acting as a run-off in times of heavy rainfall, said Christopher Cook, senior research fellow of the Institute for Security and Resilience at University College London.

The canal remains a proposal at the moment, and a number of further studies are needed to establish the various business cases. The scheme would certainly not be cheap – Aecom estimates that a 10m-15m-wide canal would cost somewhere between £12bn and £20bn. ""Funding is a big challenge,"" said Simon Bamford, head of water at the Canal and River Trust. ""And of course, this is something that would cut through communities and the countryside.""

We have already seen the opposition to large-scale projects with the HS2 rail scheme, but Cook believes that a canal scheme could face less opposition. ""People do not want to live next to HS2, Runway 3 (at Heathrow) or the M99, but they do want to live next to water."" The canal would provide tourism and recreation benefits as well as acting as a haven for wildlife and biodiversity. And while one of the reasons people oppose HS2 is the threat of a fall in house prices, a canal, by contrast, may lift land values, Weight said.

The plan may not need public funding because of the number of different services it could provide. However, given the wide range of different organisations that could be involved, including water companies, transmission operators, data centres, forestry companies and a whole slew of local authorities, it would need government support to make it happen.

However, not everyone is in favour. ""The fundamental problem this idea seeks to address is valid – the south east and eastern England face growing populations and a changing climate that will put pressure on water resources,"" said Ciaran Nelson, head of communications at Anglian Water. ""But that is not a problem that is restricted to just those regions.""

In recent years, the north west of England and Scotland have experienced their own water shortages, he pointed out. ""It also overlooks the existing interconnectivity that exists within and between different regions. We would do much better to improve connectivity between water companies – it would be far more cost-effective and easy to implement.""

Nonetheless, the government is cautiously encouraging of the plan. A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said: ""We are also always pleased to see other organisations highlighting new thinking and stimulating innovation into the water sector."" However, it warned: ""Water is heavy and costly to move across long distances, and transferring water through canals and rivers can cause damage to the environment so proposals for new transfers need careful consideration.""

""Of course, it is not without its challenges,"" said Bamford, ""but if no-one came up with these ideas then nothing would ever happen.""

37,37,FL-2013-000155-IDN,Water in Lebanon: Matching Myth with Reality - Feature - World Bank Group,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/12/23/water-in-lebanon-matching-myth-with-reality,"Throughout history, countless songs and poems have celebrated Lebanon’s sweeping and picturesque landscape: snow-capped mountains overlooking a pristine Mediterranean, wandering rivers dividing bustling cities and towns, and mounds of colorful fruits and vegetables on fertile spring-fed lands.

Today, however, it can be hard to match the reality with the poems. Especially when it comes to water, there is little to sing about. A large majority of those living in Lebanon only have access to water for a few hours per day. The little water they do receive from public infrastructure is generally perceived to be of poor quality. Those who can afford it, resort to expensive bottled and tanker water. Over 20,000 illegal groundwater wells have also been dug across the Greater Beirut and Mount Lebanon area alone. It is where over half of the Lebanese population lives, works, and endures the dramatic winter floods, polluted sea waters, and either poor quality or highly expensive water.

For decades, the Lebanese have grappled with how to improve the way in which natural water resources are managed. Debates abound on the role of the private sector in water and sanitation, number of dams needed, relevance of agriculture and food security, cost effectiveness of infrastructure, public acceptance of water meters, and perhaps most critically, what to do first.

History has also proven that these debates can be particularly productive, especially when informed by different opinions and voices. The impressive Qaroun Dam and associated hydroelectric infrastructure, the many water laws dealing with complex issues of inter-basin transfers, private sector participation and corporatization of public water companies, and more recently the development of the National Water Sector Strategy, developed over several years and approved by Parliament in March 2012, are a few examples of successful Lebanese projects that benefited from intense national debate.

Furthermore, the importance of ensuring the safety of water supplied across Lebanon is something that everyone can agree on. The World Bank Group has put the safety of water service delivery at the heart of all the water projects it finances in Lebanon.

Drinking water from the tap: Delivering international water quality standards in partnership with the private sector

In 2010, following a series of particularly arid summers, rising popular discontent about the quantity and quality of water, and the clear need for an urgent solution to close the widening water gap in the short term, the World Bank agreed to partially finance the Greater Beirut Water Supply Project. A number of institutions have joined forces for implementation, including the Ministry of Energy and Water (MOEW), Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR), and the Beirut Mount Lebanon Water Establishment (BMLWE).

This critical project will provide an additional 250,000 cubic meters of water every day to the Greater Beirut and Mount Lebanon region. It will use a combination of underground tunnels, pipelines, storage reservoirs, and a large water treatment plant, the first of its kind in Lebanon. The Ouardaniyeh water treatment plant will be located south of Beirut and will deliver drinking water to international quality standards through an innovative Design-Build-Operate (DBO) contract between the BMLWE and the private sector.

Recognizing BMLWE’s pioneering commitment to implementing innovative solutions to longstanding water problems, the World Bank Group recently partnered with the Islamic Development Bank to provide additional support. A US$680,000 grant to the Greater Beirut project will assist BMLWE in attracting and benefiting from the private sector. The grant will finance the hiring of a private, water design firm to review the proposed design of the water treatment plant, along with the various treatment technologies submitted for consideration, and assist with the supervision of construction.

Dam Safety: Bringing International Expertise Onsite

Looking ahead, the long term sustainability of the Lebanese water sector will rely on measures that simultaneously increase the volume of water available and decrease the amounts wasted or lost.

To increase the volume of water stored and made available for use, a number of the dams identified in the National Water Sector Strategy are at various stages of review, design and construction. Largest amongst these is the Bisri dam which will store an additional 120 million cubic meters of water for potable use.

In light of the size and complexity of the proposed Bisri dam, the Lebanese Government has recruited a panel of experts on dam safety to review the design of the dam and to ensure that all safety aspects of design, construction, operation, and maintenance are incorporated into the final plans. The panel includes internationally-renowned experts in dam design, hydrogeology, hydrology, and seismology, with direct experience on many of the world’s largest and most complex dams.

The Lebanese government has clearly demonstrated a commitment to the safety and sustainability of water sector projects. The actions of the government have confirmed both to the World Bank Group and other development partners that international best practice will be incorporated into all projects. Perhaps more importantly, these actions also confirm to water users across Lebanon, that their need for clean, continuous, and safe water has been not only debated, but heard.","Mon, 23 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/share-logo/social-share.jpg,"['water', 'private', 'safety', 'dam', 'lebanese', 'design', 'lebanon', 'beirut', 'quality', 'sector', 'reality', 'myth', 'matching']", 
38,38,FL-2013-000155-IDN,"The world has fresh water, but it's full of poison - The Conversation",https://theconversation.com/the-world-has-fresh-water-but-its-full-of-poison-21081,"Images of the typhoon-ravaged Philippines were terribly confronting, vividly conveying what an angry planet can dish up. But amid the destruction and death, an important point was largely missed: the world’s freshwater supplies are being degraded by a seemingly endless sequence of extreme events.

While infrastructures such as dams, sewerage plants, pumps and aqueduct/ stormwater systems can be destroyed by supercharged events, natural disasters can also strike a blow against water security. They can contaminate surface water with fecal matter (bacteria, viruses, protozoa, parasites and excreted drug products with a high level of persistence in the environment).

Toxic chemicals are released into soils and waterways from the flooding of polluted surfaces. Industrial containers are punctured, sewerage lines broken, latrines smashed, bodies decay and survivors defecate straight into the morass. Unpicking the pollutants from this witch’s brew becomes an engineering and economic nightmare.

Storm surge (it reached 3m in the Philippines) is yet another headache. And it doesn’t just affect poor countries: we saw it in the wealthy coastal communities of New York and New Jersey in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.

Apart from the physical damage to infrastructure, storm surge can leave surface and ground water adulterated by seawater. Stripping this mess of salt alone requires reverse osmosis treatment at incalculable carbon and financial cost. In most cases it doesn’t go ahead because the sheer scale of the remediation effort is prohibitive.

Oxfam International

What should we do? Responses inevitably turn to preventative engineering solutions such as raised groundwater wells or disaster resilient reservoirs. But could a point be approaching where the sheer scale of catastrophes overwhelm even “hardened” buildings and infrastructures? (Whether such modifications could be afforded by developing rural communities is another question entirely.)

Certainly, renowned climate scientist James Hansen and his co-researchers think that we could well reach that point if we burn all our reserves of fossil fuels, observing that the resultant extreme weather would be totally beyond our capacities to adapt to.

These high impact events are being overlain on a situation where, according to one estimate, 1500km3 of global water is degrading every year.

The figures are rubbery, but we do know the number is growing at an exponential rate because of rising population and urbanisation in developing countries. As much as 90% of urban waste water in these places is being discharged to waterways and lakes insufficiently treated or directly untreated. This waste water constitutes a serious threat to human health, diversity of plants and animals, food security and the sustainability of water resources.

Source: WHO/UNICEF Global Water Supply and Sanitation Assessment 2000 Report.

The gravity of the situation in developing countries is further highlighted by UNICEF and WHO’s World Sanitation Ladder.

Although a general improvement can be seen, these proportions are probably offset by ballooning population growth, especially in Southern Asia and South Eastern Asia where there’s still significant “open defecation” (straight to the ground). And that’s not to mention arsenic contamination of drinking water stemming from over exploitation of groundwater, particularly in Bangladesh.

Such trends in water pollution have caught the attention of businesses, with global energy and minerals forecasting firm Wood Mackenzie worried about “increased depletion of the resource over time, and growing concerns over contamination of dwindling water supplies”.

In fact, many streams are now largely effluent. India’s Yamuna River has no freshwater flow for almost nine months of the year: Delhi impounds water at a barrage constructed at Wazirabad, causing subsequent downstream flows to consist of sewage and other effluent. The oxygen-starved state of the river is evident from masses of rising sludge from the bottom, gas bubbles and floating solids on the surface.

The River Jordan is similarly blighted where extractions by Israel, Jordan (tributary) and Syria (tributary) have shrunk it to a meandering 100km stretch below Lake Kinneret that is mainly made up of effluent.

Then there’s China, where domestic sewage and nutrient leaching from farms have affected waterways and lakes. Recent data showed that nearly two-thirds of 40 freshwater lakes surveyed were eutrophic or de-oxygenated, including the iconic Taihu, Hongze and Caohu lakes.

In all these places an unfathomable cocktail of previous discharges is sequestered in soils, lake sediments and stream banks. Any measure of past prevention would clearly have been better than trying to clean this mess up now.

A more realistic objective is to reduce wastewater at the source while preventing toxic waste streams entering sensitive environments.

Excreted antibiotics and resistant bacteria (aka superbugs), widely found in effluent, can persist in water as resistant bacteria which people can acquire through the food chain. This suggests vast quantities of global wastewater identified by the UN will require exacting treatment if they are to have any hope of being safely reused.

In particular, the explosive use of cheap, generic antibiotics in Asia and India could see them leaving a devastating mark on the environment, possibly leading to a major health crisis.

And, coming full circle, the plague of natural disasters should encourage us to concentrate our minds on toughening up water infrastructures to limit future disruption.","Wed, 18 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/37505/original/9j3ygcnr-1386801011.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['water', 'global', 'freshwater', 'waterways', 'lakes', 'river', 'effluent', 'world', 'infrastructures', 'poison', 'fresh', 'waste', 'point']",

In no particular order, dive back into our selection of the fun but frivolous viral hits that flooded the online world in 2013.

The Harlem Shake

It all started with a drunken basketball fan in 1980s New York. Then at the end of January 2013 a vlogger known as Filthy Frank posted his own version on YouTube, which was picked up by a group of Australian high-school students. Then, it took the planet by storm.

2013 Russian meteor explosion

Russian dashboard and CCTV cameras seem an inexhaustible source of viral videos, recording most often brutal car accidents, drunken street fights or just plain old WTF moments. But once in a while they are the privileged witnesses of something from another world. On February 15 at about 09:20 local time, a bright ball of fire lit up the skies over the Southern Urals as what would be known as the Chelyabinsk meteor entered the Earth’s atmosphere at almost 60 times the speed of sound. The meteor exploded in an airburst that created between 20 and 30 times more energy than the Little Boy bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. This airburst and the following shockwave injured around 1,500 people and damaged 7,200 buildings in the area, for what is undoubtedly one of the most striking videos of the year.

“Ylvis - What does the fox say?”

Falling short of becoming 2013’s Gangnam Style, Norwegian comedy duo Ylvis’ song still managed to rack up a whopping 287 million views (at time of writing). And that is just for the official music video. If the song (and music video) lampoons the typical mainstream electronic music flooding dance floors Europe-wide, its “stuck-in-your-head” factor is undeniably high. “What does the fox say” was even covered by the cast of US TV series Glee, a fact that can either be seen as an achievement for Ylvis or a desperate move from the Glee producers to stay relevant with what their viewers are watching online.

Emotional Baby Starts Crying At Mom's Singing

Baby videos are a staple for viral hits. This one is no different, with equal parts emotions and cuteness. Recorded on August 1 and uploaded on October 18, it shows ten-month-old Mary-Lynne Leroux of Ontario, Canada, tearing up as she listens to her mother Amanda’s a cappella cover of Rod Stewart’s “My heart can’t tell you no”. This musical-themed upload struck a chord for about 28 million viewers in only a few months.

The US federal government shutdown

The US federal government shutdown was a particularly active time for discussions online – read partisan bickering – as each side was blaming the other for the situation that lasted from October 1 until October 16.

This picture, which first emerged on Reddit, was catapulted into viral stardom by Buzzfeed in a post entitled “This Adorable Sad Image Is Now The Official Photo of the US Government Shutdown.” Some users online have raised questions about whether the picture is staged, while the Washington Post published a column from someone wo knows the child in real life. Disregarding this dose of healthy scepticism, the picture managed to encapsulate one of the many highly unfair situations caused by the shutdown.

Doge

Prominent on blogging platform Tumblr, doge has nothing to do with a Venetian leader. This meme, which became popular in 2013 but can be traced back to the end of last year, is like a recipe for internet meme-ness. It includes 1) pictures of a dog, of the 2) admittedly cute Shiba Inu breed, 3) originating in Japan, with 4) text in cutesy broken English, written in – possibly ironically, 5) Comic Sans font. Said text can be adapted for each situation.

As Gawker.com explains: “Like any good meme, the text adheres to an easy-to-follow formula, which starts with “Wow,” then continues something like “Such X,” and “Many X,” “So X,” where X is words related to the background image.”

Kinda like this:

Marina’s dancing resignation video

What does a viral-video-editor do when she or he wants to quit her or his job? Make a viral video about it! That is what happened when then-video-editor Marina Shifrin got sick of the allegedly poor working condition at her job for Taiwanese Next Media Animation and went out with a bang. Her video, of her dancing to the tune of Kanye West’ “Gone” with subtitles enumerating her grievances, went viral and has now reached 17 million views.

A few days later, her former employers answered to announce… they were hiring a replacement.



Sour grapes? The dislike ratio under this video – with 2 “dislikes” to 1 “like” – would suggest what the netizens think.

Twerking

If twerking (a possible portemanteaux of “twist” and “jerk”) has been popular in the Southern US hip-hop and strip club culture since the early 2000’s, and can be linked to traditional African and Caribbean dances, it reached the mainstream spotlight in 2013. All it took was for former American sweetheart Miley Cyrus to grind and twerk against the groin of Robin Thicke during a performance at the MTV Video Music Awards. The Internet went crazy, with results like this, emerging around Thanksgiving:

The word was added to the Oxford Dictionary Online, Oxford English Dictionary’s younger and more reactive brother, under the definition “twerk, v.: dance to popular music in a sexually provocative manner involving thrusting hip movements and a low, squatting stance” according to QZ.com.

Vine

Twitter launched mobile video app Vine on January 24. It allows users to make a 6-second looping video clip, with sounds. Short, easily shareable and embeddable on the Web, it aimed to become the tool of reference for bite-size viral videos.

Vine reached its full potential during the Boston bombings, when a user posted a Vine of the recording of the exact moment the bomb near the finish line exploded.

Since then, Vine has gotten more popular, often with lighter content, and now funny Vine compilations abound on video sharing platforms. Photo sharing app Instagram launched its own video service not long after, with 15-second clips and the possibility of using rudimentary editing tools as well as the famous Instagram faux vintage filters.

At euronews, we use Vine for our Vine of the day, 6 seconds of the most significant, dramatic or surprising footage of the day. For instance:



Hadoukening/Vadering

Take a famous pop culture scene, mimick it with your friends in front of a camera and boom, you have now a meme. Hadoukening refers to video game Street Fighter Ken’s fireball; Vadering to Star War’s Darth Vader irascible force-choking of insubordinate subordinates.

Selfies at funerals

Selfies, or digital self-portraits, have been everywhere online since at least Myspace, and its misleading “Myspace angle.” This year, people on the Internet took it up a notch and decided to take selfies in unexpected places, including at funerals.

A whole Tumblr was dedicated to record what many saw as a new low in behaviour triggered by the spread of mobile technology. People do inappropriate things online, nothing really new.

Then, US president Barack Obama, British PM David Cameron and Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt took a selfie during the funeral service for Nelson Mandela on December 10. This act secured ‘selfies at funerals’ a spot on our list. You can read the AFP photographer version of the picture here.

Grumpy cat

Scientists are still unable to prove the common theory that the Internet is made of cats, but cat and kitty pictures are a large share of the content online. This year, one cat’s grumpy face was everywhere.



Meet Tardar Sauce, nicknamed Grumpy Cat by the Internet thanks to her furrowed furry brow. She is a real star, complete with manager. She won BuzzFeed’s Meme of the Year Award at the 2013 Webby Awards and even got invited to the super geeky South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas.

And this despite, arguably, not being cute; her grumpy face is actually a medical condition caused by feline dwarfism and an under bite.

Singing goats

Take a popular music video and mix it up with the oddly human-sounding bleating of various goats. It is very silly, but then that’s what memes are for.

40,40,FL-2013-000155-IDN,Walking away from Holden: Abbott finishes what Hewson started - The Conversation,https://theconversation.com/walking-away-from-holden-abbott-finishes-what-hewson-started-21376,"“Building cars in Australia is just not sustainable.”

That was GM Holden managing director Mike Devereux, announcing the closure of Holden.

Ominous words for Toyota as well. Toyota responded that Holden’s departure places “unprecedented pressures” on the company.

When Ford announced its exit from local manufacturing in May this year, CEO Bob Graziano noted that Ford’s costs were double those of its plants in Europe, and triple those of its Asian factories.

As the Australian dollar rose in 2011–12, the automotive products export market suffered from a competitive disadvantage, even as Europe, Japan and the US flooded markets with euro, yen and US dollars, sparking virtually-unprecedented depreciations of the world’s three biggest reserve currencies.

But Holden’s departure is nevertheless a deliberate public policy choice on the part of the Abbott government. It has been clear since 1992, when Liberal leader Dr John Hewson announced a zero tariff regime for automotive products, that the Coalition parties saw no future in an Australian car manufacturing industry.

The Abbott government’s refusal to countenance further industry assistance should come as no surprise: in opposition, the Coalition’s firm policy was to cut A$500 million from the ALP government’s support package.

Indeed, the federal government has pre-empted the findings of its own Productivity Commission, rendering whatever conclusions it reaches almost entirely moot.

Could the government have intervened further in order to manage the industry’s decline in a more orderly manner? Yes. Did the government want to? Unlikely.

Political fallout

It’s reasonable to suggest the Coalition will not lose a lot of votes from plant closures in Labor strongholds. Broadmeadows and Geelong (Ford) are safe ALP seats, as is Wakefield (Elizabeth, Holden). The fallout in South Australia is unlikely to do ALP premier Jay Weatherill any favours in the forthcoming state election.

But in Victoria, where the Napthine Coalition governs with a single-seat majority, the stakes are higher. As the centre of Australian manufacturing, Victoria stands to suffer the most from Holden’s departure; 28,000 jobs are linked directly with the automotive industry, with thousands more indirect jobs at risk.

Virtually every automotive firm has faced market and financial challenges since the 2008 global financial crisis. So ferocious was the financial storm that the German industry – Daimler-Benz, BMW and VW – proclaimed it the “Worst Crisis since World War II”. 100,000 German auto jobs were slated to disappear by 2018; Mercedes announced production cuts of 150,000 units for 2009.

Volkswagen, Daimler, BMW and GM-owned Opel appealed to the Merkel government for loan guarantees; they sought a softening of Europe’s carbon pollution reduction scheme; and they asked for buyer subsidies.

Merkel responded. Unwilling to see large scale job losses, she looked for a buyer for Opel (GM ultimately kept the company). She introduced a “cash for clunkers” scheme to subsidise new car purchases; and across industries, the German government introduced generous R&D concessions on green and electric vehicle measures.

As Merkel acted, the Rudd government also intervened in the Australian industry, announcing a doubling of car industry funding to A$6.2 billion in November 2008, adding A$3.4 billion, while maintaining a commitment to reducing tariffs to 5% in 2010.

Spillover

The link between the automotive sector, and the skill base it generates, is well known. CAD/CAM, chassis systems, braking components, aerodynamics and safety systems are amongst the many technical knowledge bases that are enshrined in the industry. The universities are also important sources of skilled graduates in mechanical and electrical engineering.

There are also spillovers into the defence materiel, construction and some aspects of the mining industry, particularly from the automotive components sector.

Will auto components firms and 50,000 jobs directly connected to the industry survive? Companies that rely upon the economies and efficiencies deriving from scale associated with the local auto manufacturing industries will not. More diverse components suppliers will persist, albeit on a smaller scale.

Can the auto components industry supply parts for imported vehicles? Yes. But free trade agreements (FTAs) with the US, Thailand and Singapore – and now South Korea – will mean cheap parts can enter Australia tariff-free. If the Abbott government concludes a FTA with China within 12 months, as promised, the Chinese auto parts sector would quickly devour what remains of the Australian industry.","Wed, 11 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/37456/original/r2y9dgb6-1386740675.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['parts', 'components', 'auto', 'automotive', 'holdens', 'german', 'manufacturing', 'industry', 'abbott', 'holden', 'walking', 'away', 'started', 'jobs', 'australian', 'hewson', 'finishes']",

While water for drinking may be first to come to mind, as agriculture is the largest use of water worldwide water scarcity first and foremost is a threat to food supply. And as many industrial processes rely on water availability, it also hampers economic development.

In the simplest sense, water scarcity is supply falling short of demand. Demand for freshwater will increase in most regions of the world due to population growth. Between eight and ten billion people are expected to live on Earth in 2050, as opposed to six billion today. But as for supply, water resources will be affected by projected climate changes due to unabated greenhouse gas emissions, for instance through changes in the amount, pattern and timing of rainfall and evaporation.

While rising demand is hard to end, climate change could still be contained. This is why our study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, tried to identify the relative impact of climate change on water scarcity. The effect turned out to be substantial. Assembled by an international team of researchers, simulations using a large range of hydrological models suggest climate change is likely to put about 40% more people at risk of absolute water scarcity than would be the case without climate change.

From scarcity to absolute scarcity

This is not a far-off future. The steepest increase of global water scarcity might happen before global warming reaches 3°C above pre-industrial levels. Which means the internationally adopted target of limiting warming to 2°C is very relevant to global water resources. But as the world seems largely set on “business as usual”, we are set to burst through that 2°C limit within a few decades. Today, between one and two people out of a hundred live in countries with absolute water scarcity. Allowing for a 3°C rise in temperature and rising population, this could increase to ten in a hundred.

UN/World Water Development Report 4

Absolute water scarcity is defined as less than 500m3 per person, per year. Some industrialised countries can cope with such a small amount through advanced water management and processing techniques. But in many others, the necessary infrastructure simply isn’t there, and absolute water scarcity puts lives and livelihoods at risk.

The planet’s changing water cycle

The impact of climate change is not uniform across the world, and there will be large differences from region to region. For example, the Mediterranean, Middle East, the southern states of North America, and southern China will very probably experience a pronounced drop in available water. In contrast, Southern India, western China and parts of Eastern Africa may see substantial increases in average water resources from increasingly tropical, wet weather. This could be beneficial if the extra water comes at the right time and if the means to use and manage it is in place. If not, it may just add to problems from water-logging, flooding, and causing sewage and drain systems to fail – something that happens regularly in Europe even now. The overall risks are thus growing along with the rapid changes in the global water cycle.

And these changes are still far from completely understood. Our study is part of an unprecedented worldwide scientific effort to more systematically assess the impact of climate change. We used a suite of hydrological models, fed with different future climate scenarios. But all these models show a similar trend; while the numbers differ, reflecting the underlying assumptions, water is increasingly scarce. Evaluating the differences between the model simulations will help us better understand what lies ahead.","Sun, 22 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/38372/original/w8fmzzqm-1387540853.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['water', 'meet', 'global', 'struggle', 'scarcity', 'climate', 'absolute', 'supply', 'changes', 'change', 'world', 'demands', 'thirstier', 'southern']",

Cultivation of opium poppies in South East Asia Cultivation of opium poppies in South East Asia Cultivation of opium poppies in South East Asia

In an annual report, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime estimated Burma, also known as Myanmar, produced 870 tons of opium in 2013 - the highest amount since it began keeping track in 2002.



Burma is second only to Afghanistan in growing opium poppies, a key ingredient in heroin and other illegal drugs.



In 1999, the country promised to eradicate opium production by 2014. But production has now gone up for seven straight years.



Jason Eligh, UNODC's country manager for Burma, says the idea of a drug-free Burma is a ""quite long way away.""



One of the main problems, Eligh says, is that opium poppies are the only source of adequate income for many farmers in Burma, which is Southeast Asia's poorest country.



""If a family has no money and they don't have the capacity through the environment around them to earn money, then they're going to take whatever measures they can to try and get money just to survive, just to eat, and that's what we're seeing occurring,"" he said.



Year after year, the UNODC reports find that opium production is also linked to ethnic unrest along Burma's northeast border areas.

Most of Burma's illegal opium crops are found in Kachin and Shan states, where violence between insurgents and the army have raged on for as long as 50 years.



""That's a long period of time for local infrastructure to deteriorate and in some places disappear completely. So your options, your opportunities as a farmer are significantly restricted,"" said Eligh.



Burma's government has tried to reach peace deals with many ethnic insurgent groups, though fighting rages on in some areas.



The peace efforts are part of Burma's wider political and economic reforms and opening up, which follow decades of stifling, direct military rule.



But while the region has seen improved infrastructure, Eligh says this has provided more opportunities for criminals to benefit from the illegal drug trade.



""As you get more roads, as you get bridges crossing rivers, as you get economies that are starting to integrate better with those around them... you're seeing an environment for an increase in flow of a variety of different products, and heroin is just one of a number of products that are moved for profit,"" he said.



The U.N. report also cited rising demand for illegal drugs in nearby countries, such as China, as something that was exacerbating Burma's opium problem.","Wed, 18 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/E370BB65-A50B-4B71-AC8B-6BD2E4921858.jpg,"['burma', 'poppies', 'production', 'opium', 'illegal', 'burmas', 'state', 'money', 'increases', 'south', 'long']",

Christmas and New Year are just round the corner, but the Mall Roads in Nainital and Mussoorie wear a deserted look these days.



The tourism industry of India's two premier hill stations in Uttarakhand is yet to recover from the aftermath of the June floods.



The inflow of tourists into these famous hill stations received a setback. But people in the tourism business are hopeful that these places will again see a surge of tourists in the coming days.



Comeback: Nainital and Mussourie have not got the rush of Christmas tourists so far this year

Nainital attracted more than nine lakh visitors and Mussoorie over 22 lakh tourists last year.

This year, even a massive publicity campaign after the June calamity, with the state government claiming 'Uttarakhand is safe for tourists,' has failed to woo visitors.



Mussoorie is providing an added attraction in the form of 'Winterline Winter Carnival', jointly organised by the ministry of tourism of Uttarakhand and the Mussoorie municipal council, from December 27 to 30 to attract tourists.

Mussoorie Hotel Association's president R.N. Mathur said: ""Normally tourists come to Mussoorie during Christmas and New Year holidays. We are keeping our finger crossed this year too. The hotel industry here has suffered a big loss this time.



""Bengalis in large number used to come here during Durga Puja, but this year a low turnout was registered. So far, we have suffered about 80 per cent dip in the turnout.""



Nainital is in a makeover mode these days to woo visitors. A music concert is set to enthrall people during the New Year celebrations.

GUADALAJARA - By his own admission, starring at the 2011 Under-20 World Cup changed Edson Rivera’s life.

The Atlas player netted twice against host nation Colombia in the quarterfinal to help Mexico to a 3-1 victory, with his second a solo effort to beat the keeper from outside the area.

Offers from Portugal, Spain, France and elsewhere flooded in for the 19-year-old forward who hadn’t yet even debuted for Atlas in the Liga MX.

After carefully thinking it over with his agent and family, Rivera opted for Braga in the Portuguese first division.

“It was a watershed moment not just for my career but also in my life,” Rivera told Goal.com recently in a Guadalajara café.

It was also a rare example of a Mexican heading to Europe at an early age.

But before he went, there was first a battle with Atlas to get the deal done, with Rivera explaining that “the gentleman’s pact doesn’t allow you to leave,” something he feels holds up other young Mexicans wanting to try their luck on the other side of the Atlantic.

Rivera pushed the move through and turned down a contract offer with Atlas, but the European adventure didn’t work out exactly as he would’ve wanted. The forward, who prefers to play as a “nine-and-a-half” but is also comfortable on the wing, did debut in Portugal’s top division but couldn’t nail down a regular spot.

“It takes a little time to adapt,” he said. “I hadn’t debuted here (in Mexico), I didn’t even know even what it was like to be in a first team squad. I arrived there and with players of that level it is a little difficult at 19.

“Apart from being intelligent, they are very strong players, they already have experience and the speed at which they play … They play more physically over there and take advantage of that. Here it is something that doesn’t have great importance.”

In November 2012, Rivera and Atlas put aside previous problems and the Rojinegros re-signed their youth product, who, at the time, said he had the opportunity to stay in Europe but preferred to try and get minutes with his hometown club.

Since then, the now 22-year-old Rivera has begun to show the talent that had European clubs drooling into actual performances for the first team.

Few players could’ve netted the kind of goal he scored against Atlante back in February, lifting the ball over a defender with his back to the goal before turning and striking a sweet volley into the corner of the net. His tearful, heartfelt celebration was because of his mother’s death weeks before.

Arguably Rivera’s best moment of his professional career so far came in November in the Copa MX final against Morelia, even if Atlas did lose on penalties.

Rivera pulled the strings for Atlas in the 3-3 draw, playing an exquisite ball for Matias Vuoso to score the Rojinegros’ second. He showed a new kind of maturity in his play to suggest he is now ready for the next step.

Coupled with his height and increased strength, Rivera has set his goal for next season as regular minutes, with the club’s greatest attacking threat Omar Bravo having left for Chivas.

In that he’ll be helped by the return of coach Tomas Boy, who seemed to favor Rivera in his last spell at the club, which has been rejuvenated by the recent sale to TV Azteca after years of financial uncertainty.



Rivera said that despite Atlas having a reputation as one of the best youth systems in Mexico and producing many international players like Pavel Pardo, Oswaldo Sanchez and Rafa Marquez, he believes there is much to improve, although he’s hoping the money coming into the club can turn that around.

“We’re happy,” Rivera said. “I don’t want to say that before we weren’t, but now there’s security and hope that good things are coming, there’ll be economic support in different aspects that they couldn’t improve before.”

As for Rivera’s longer-term goals, the national team and a potential return to Europe are the top priorities. For now though, he remains a young Mexican potentially on the brink of breaking out in a big way in 2014.

Increasingly, the two issues – climate change and human rights – are being recognized as inextricably connected. Two major studies published this year reinforce that link, providing sobering evidence that a hotter, increasingly unstable climate is fueling more conflict and human rights violations, and that it is happening sooner rather than later.



The first study was published in the journal Science by researchers at Princeton University and the University of California, Berkeley. Researchers found that a hotter, more unstable climate exacerbates three specific types of violence: personal violence (such as murder, rape and domestic violence), intergroup violence/political instability and institutional breakdowns (including the collapse of governing institutions and whole civilizations).



Lead author Prof. Solomon Hsiang said the study includes “meta-analysis” of 60 previous studies from disciplines like history, economics, geography, criminology and political science. The research strongly indicates that tropical regions of the world, in particular, will be “very intensely hit”.



If tropical populations remain on their current trajectories, Hsiang said certain types of intergroup violence could exceed a 50 percent amplification in association with climate change.



Hsiang is cautious about drawing a direct link between climate change data and specific human rights abuses, but said, “There’s certainly the potential for situations where the climate leads to political changes that could adversely affect people’s rights,” adding, [climate change] destabilises and tests the amount of stress social institutions can endure.”



“There is a lot of political rhetoric after disasters where people talk about becoming stronger as a community or economically because of it, but…there is very little evidence that is actually true,” Hsiang said. “Populations tend to be permanently worse off, families don’t necessarily become stronger because of these disasters, they end up struggling much more. Political organisations tend to do very badly.”



In the face of greater violence, Hsiang said research continues to examine how certain social and political institutions may help mitigate some of the impacts that lead to more conflict. “What are the things that let societies weather [climate change] without exhibiting any type of conflict? That’s what we want to know so we can help create ‘pockets of calm’ in the future,” Hsiang said.



Sooner than later



The second study, published in the journal Nature by the University of Hawaii’s (UH) Department of Geography, presents a concrete time frame when temperatures will reach unprecedented levels – so-called “climate departure”.



The projected timing of climate departure refers to specific dates when given locations around the world continuously exceed historical temperature averages for the last 150 years. The study does not suggest the world will lose seasonality but, when averaged over a year’s time, temperatures will depart from recent historical norms.



Co-author Ryan Longman said, “The coldest year in the future will be hotter than the hottest year in the past.” He added that the earliest impacts will occur in the tropics and have a ripple-effect to northern latitudes.



Speaking from Honolulu, UH researcher and co-author Abby Frazier said climate change provokes three main reactions in plants and animals: migrating to more suitable environments, staying and adapting to the new climate or going extinct.



“It’s very sobering,” Frazier said. “We see all of the evidence piling up and it’s really hard for people to accept that our future is heading toward these unprecedented climates. We’re trying our best to get the information out there in a concrete way that can connect people to this and is not abstract.”

“The coldest year in the future will be hotter than that hottest year in the past.” – Ryan Longman



The UH study finds that on average, by 2047, under a “business-as-usual” scenario, the world will be experiencing a “radically different climate.” The study pays special attention to tropical regions. Frazier points out that while the largest absolute changes in climate do not occur in the tropics, because they are, by nature, climatically stable, it takes less change to exceed historic norms. As a result, the tropics are expected to experience climate departure first with Indonesia, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, Mexico, India, Colombia and Iraq forecast to see climate departure as soon as 2020 and no later than 2036.



“There’s no doubt that those early changes in the tropics will be felt at higher latitude even if the temperature is not getting hotter as fast,” Longman said.



Frazier noted that climate change puts additional stresses on countries already facing extreme environmental degradation, burgeoning young populations and growing political instability. These countries have lower GDPs and less economic capacity to respond to climate change than those that have had the biggest role in producing carbon emissions.



From toxic to ‘more toxic’



Richard Pearshouse, a senior researcher with the health and human rights division of Human Rights Watch (HRW) in Geneva, recently contributed to a report examining environmental, health and safety conditions in and around the tanneries of Hazaribagh, on the outskirts of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Listed as one of the top ten toxic threats on the planet in 2013, Hazaribagh epitomises how an environment degraded by extreme pollution and fed by climate refugees produces a human rights catastrophe.



Pearshouse told Al Jazeera, “Climate change will affect many of the most vulnerable in society. It will affect the poor, it will affect religious or ethnic minorities, it will affect women and children. That should say a lot to a human rights organisation. It’s going to be the most marginalised who feel those impacts most acutely.”



From health, housing and education to the right to life itself, Pearshouse sees climate change as having a massive impact on “a vast range of civil and political rights”.



“If [climate change] is going to be about impacting on the most marginalised, then it’s going to be an issue of discrimination…and whether or not existing resilience or mitigation measures that are put in place by governments or international mechanisms truly reflect the reality of who’s suffering most on the ground.”



Human rights groups like HRW, Amnesty International and others already work with environmental and climate groups but Pearshouse sees room for greater cooperation on a national and provincial level. “I think that as the human cost of climate change becomes increasingly evident, it’s untenable for human rights organisations not to be working on some of those issues,” he said.



Bangladesh is a prime example of how climate change impacts impoverished fishing villages along the Bay of Bengal with more frequent, more powerful cyclones and flooding which drives villagers to migrate to places like Hazaribagh. There, out of desperation, the rural poor live in slums where the air, water and earth are so polluted by chemicals, tin roofing corrodes in months rather than years and severe health afflictions are the norm.



“As someone who works on human rights and health, to me and my colleagues, that [climate change] overlap is very much apparent, particularly when you go someplace like Hazaribagh and see the amount of human suffering caused by extreme environmental degradation. To me that overlap is very, very obvious,” Pearshouse said.



Whether it’s a government unwilling to enforce basic health and environmental protective safeguards in Bangladesh, state-sponsored repression of climate and environmental defenders in Russia, or military forces involved in illegal logging in Cambodia, Pearshouse said examples of clear links between the unofficial exercise of government power and environmental harm are found around the world.



Facing a human rights ‘meltdown’



Far from the toxic tanneries of Bangladesh, indigenous peoples across Russia’s far north face new and increasing threats to their basic human rights as resource extraction, development, industrial pollution and climate change converge at the top of the world.



Rodion Sulyandziga represents the interests of RAIPON (Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North) with the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum promoting cooperation among Arctic states and indigenous communities.



Speaking from Moscow, Sulyandziga described how the loss of sea ice, decline in snow levels and permafrost and general warming all impact the most basic human rights of the 41 indigenous groups in Siberia and the Russian far north and Far East: the right to live.



Increasingly unpredictable weather and unreliable sea ice directly impacts animal migration, which affects subsistence hunting for traditional food sources like reindeer and sea mammals. Warmer temperatures, Sulyandziga said, also hasten the introduction of plant and animal diseases as southern species of fish and birds move north.



In addition to a warming Arctic, Russia’s indigenous peoples also face the rush to exploit vast energy and mineral resources. Oil, gas, coal, nickel, iron ore, platinum and other minerals draw multi-national corporations to Russia’s most remote regions where highly restricted access makes monitoring health and safety practices, damage and pollution mitigation and other conditions difficult or impossible.



RAIPON has worked with Greenpeace and smaller environmental organisations to protect the environment critical to the livelihoods of indigenous peoples, Sulyandziga said.



Last year RAIPON was subject to a temporary closure when the Russian Ministry of Justice forced it to cease activities during a five-month investigation of what it alleged were “illegal activities” and defenders called a registration technicality. This kind of extra scrutiny of NGOs makes protecting indigenous and environmental interests even more difficult.



Sulyandziga added, “Russia now approved the Arctic strategy meaning they declare the Arctic is a main resource [of] economic development for the whole country. That means potential conflicts will grow among stakeholders, including indigenous people.”



He also spoke of the threat to basic human rights for indigenous groups stemming from illegal timber harvesting, the destruction of arboreal forests and its role in massive wildfires and last year’s devastating floods in the Russian Far East. His own people, the Udege (which means “forest people”) live in the affected area near the Amur River north of Vladivostok.



The biggest human rights violation ever



Back at the University of Hawaii, lead author of the above climate departure study, Dr. Camilo Mora, assistant professor in the UH geography department, sees climate change as a problem of fairness. “While developed countries are benefitting from [carbon] emissions, developing countries are the ones that are going to pay the most consequences from this,” Mora told Al Jazeera.



“The science is as solid as it can be. Now it’s for us to start acting and I think that’s where we’re struggling to convince people of how real this thing is. We have seven billion people we need to convey this message to.”



Mora said climate change is, and will continue to be, interconnected to the most basic of human rights: the right to have a home, food and water. “I don’t think there is a disconnection [to human rights], in fact, things are more connected than people tend to assume.”



Greenpeace International’s executive director, Dr. Kumi Naidoo, argues the same point. Naidoo recently said, “The struggle to avert catastrophic climate change and the struggles for human rights, poverty and gender equity are and should be seen as two sides of the same coin.”

BEIRUT, Lebanon, December 12 (UNHCR) - The UN refugee agency is stepping up measures to protect the hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees in Lebanon, including 120,000 living in flimsy tents, as they face the onslaught of a massive winter storm in the region.

With the support of the Lebanese armed forces, UNHCR and NGO partners were able earlier this week to speed up the distribution of additional emergency shelter kits - including plastic sheets, timber and tools - to thousands of refugees living in tents in the Bekaa Valley, eastern Lebanon, so far the region most affected by the massive storm system dubbed ""Alexa.""

Emergency teams continued on Wednesday, despite blocked roads from the weather conditions. Alternative shelters are also being prepared for refugees whose tents may be affected by the snow, rain and flooding.

Some 125,000 refugees living in the Bekaa have received winter kits and 55,000 more will be reached in the coming days. Humanitarian agencies working throughout Lebanon have distributed 255,000 blankets and more than 6,000 stoves in the past months. Some 45,000 ATM cards (each holding US$150 in value) have also been given to vulnerable families to buy additional stoves and fuel.

Storm Alexa struck Lebanon on Tuesday night, bringing snow to higher areas and rain elsewhere, accompanied by high winds. According to forecasts, conditions are expected to remain difficult for several days, with further snow expected. Reports from Syria and parts of Turkey spoke of similarly grim conditions there.

UNHCR is particularly concerned for the many refugees in Lebanon living in makeshift accommodation, as their homes are fragile and substandard. The number of refugees in Lebanon has increased five-fold over the last year.

""For the hundreds of thousands of refugees in Lebanon, as well as those in neighbouring countries and the displaced in Syria, a storm like this creates immense additional hardship and suffering,"" said Amin Awad, director of UNHCR's Middle East and North Africa Bureau. ""With Lebanon's help, we're doing everything we can to get rapid additional help to people who most need it. This is on top of the winter preparations already done over the past months.""

A host of other humanitarian agencies are working on the winter response in Lebanon, including the World Food Programme, the Norwegian Refugee Council, the International Organization for Migration, Oxfam, Medair, Save the Children, World Vision, Humedica, Mercy Corps, Caritas, Handicap International, Concern, Acted, Danish Refugee Council (DRC)and UNICEF.

The UN refugee agency began distributing thermal blankets and other items beginning in November. Across the Middle East UNHCR has distributed some 70,000 plastic tarpaulins to help refugees better prepare their tents and shelters for winter while some have received electric or kerosene heaters.

WFP and its partners are meeting the food needs of newly arrived Syrian refugees in areas affected by the storm in Lebanon with food stocks sufficient to feed 150,000 people. Elsewhere in the country, the UN food agency is providing food assistance to over 600,000 Syrian refugees registered with UNHCR using electronic food vouchers.

Lebanon is at present the largest Syrian refugee-hosting country in the region, with almost 840,000 Syrians either registered as refugees or awaiting registration. Unlike other countries neighbouring Syria, there are no established refugee camps. Instead people are living in the community in nearly 1,600 different areas.

Lebanon has responded generously to the influx, and earlier this week authorized the use of the Lebanese military to help UNHCR in speeding up the delivery of winter aid. As of Wednesday, efforts were focused on getting help to some of the worst affected sites in the Bekaa. In Turkey, UNHCR field teams were blocked from visiting camps around Kilis today due to snow blocking roads in that region.

With almost 2.3 million Syrian refugees around the region and millions more people displaced internally in Syria, winter conditions are a major worry across the humanitarian community. Winter preparation work, involving improvements to shelters, heating, blankets and clothing, has been under way for months. The first cross-border airlift from Iraq into north-east Syria, bringing additional humanitarian winter materials to displaced populations there, is expected to launch later this week - weather permitting.","Thu, 12 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.unhcr.org/thumb1/52a98f2d6.jpg,"['food', 'refugee', 'massive', 'living', 'help', 'refugees', 'storm', 'step', 'lebanon', 'syrian', 'winter', 'measures', 'partners', 'unhcr', 'syria']",

The BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Sunday launched a fresh attack on Rahul Gandhi on the Lokpal issue, demanding to know why - if the Congress vice-president felt so strongly about the legislation - his party was not implementing the Uttarakhand Lokayukta Act brought in by the previous BJP government in the state.

Modi also took to task the Vijay Bahuguna-led government for its alleged failure to manage rehabilitation work in the aftermath of the June flash floods, and for ""targeting"" yoga guru Ramdev.

""The pride of Congress party is in seventh heaven. A Congress leader gave a lecture to the media yesterday saying the Lokpal Bill is important to weed out corruption,"" the Gujarat chief minister told a rally in Dehradun on Sunday, apparently referring to Rahul Gandhi's advocacy of the anti-corruption law at a press conference in Delhi.

About a lakh people turned up for Narendra Modi's rally in Dehradun on Sunday. It was the biggest ever rally in the city

""I ask that leader why the Congress-led government in Uttarakhand has not implemented the Lokayukta Act which was passed during Major General (Retd.) B.C. Khanduri's rule? Even social activist Anna Hazare had praised Khanduri ji after the anti-corruption Bill was passed here. Is it (bill) not important in Uttarakhand?,"" he asked.

Modi was addressing his first public rally after the BJP's stupendous performance in four Assembly elections held recently.

Initially, he used the word Netaji to refer to the Nehru-Gandhi scion, but when the crowd cheered Shahjada he replied, ""You know very well about which individual I am speaking about."" This made the gathering burst into laughter.

Modi called the Congress a party that is cut off from the public, and is mentally crooked.

The 63-year-old leader came out in support of Ramdev and accused the Congress of unnecessarily harassing him.

""Had the governments in Delhi and Dehradun used half their energy that they did against Baba Ramdev, in disaster rehabilitation, the affected people would have received greater relief. Why is Ramdev an eyesore for the Congress? The baba has made the Congress struggle for their breaths. Everyday a new case is registered against Ramdev. Is this democracy?""

Claiming the public is now fed up with the Congress, he said: ""The process of a Congress-free India has begun and the results of the recent Assembly elections indicate this. The message has presently come from four states and in the days to come it will come from all the four directions. Give us a chance to serve you.""

The Gujarat CM expressed his pain for being denied the chance to ""wipe the tears"" of disaster-hit people in Uttarakhand.



After the 16-17 June food disaster, Modi had offered help for reconstruction and restoration in Kedarnath which the Bahuguna government had declined.

BJP president Rajnath Singh hailed Modi for his ""Run for Unity"" concept.

67,67,FL-2013-000155-IDN,Uranium (IV) found to be mobile in a natural wetland - Science Daily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/12/131217123903.htm,"EPFL researchers studying a natural wetland near a decommissioned uranium mine in Limousin, France, have shown that under certain circumstances the uranium present in the wetland could be more mobile than previously believed.

Because they are known to mop up pollutants, artificial wetlands are considered to be an efficient strategy to contain waterborne uranium. But studying a natural wetland near a former uranium-mining site in the French region of Limousin, researchers have found that under certain circumstances, uranium can be partly remobilized into the surrounding water. In a recent publication in Nature Communications, they show how it becomes mobile again by binding to tiny metallic and organic compounds with a little help from ambient bacteria.

In nature, uranium is found in two forms: U-4 and U-6, where the numbers indicate how many chemical bonds the atom can form. ""Until recently, scientists thought that U-4 was immobilized as a mineral, while U-6 was considered to be the only highly soluble form,"" says the study's principle investigator Rizlan Bernier-Latmani. Today, scientists know that this distinction is not quite as clear-cut, having discovered a non-soluble, yet highly mobile form of U-4.

In wetlands, bacterial or chemical processes transform the soluble form of uranium, U-6, into U-4. ""This was considered beneficial from an environmental point of view, as it was assumed to sequester the contaminant, keeping it out of the water,"" explains Bernier-Latmani.

But now, the researchers have shown that the sequestered uranium can be more mobile than previously assumed. Studying a stream that flows through a wetland downstream of a former uranium mine in Limousin, France, they found that some of the uranium could be remobilized from the wetland into the stream. Until now, uranium concentrations at the outlet of the site were assumed to be due to the waste rocks of the former mine.

To be remobilized from the wetland, a very specific set of circumstances has to be satisfied, explains Bernier-Latmani. ""We found that uranium has to be present in the mobile form of U-4, in the presence of large quantities of organic matter, iron, and relatively little sulfide,"" she says.

According to first author Yuheng Wang, these conditions came together perfectly in the wetland that the researchers studied. Uranium was present in a clay layer as tiny aggregates of mobile U-4, along with sufficient amounts of iron. The entire wetland was teeming with bacteria as well as invisibly small string-like particles made up of organic matter.

The remobilization itself is a complex process. First, the bacteria use iron for energy, transforming it into a form that readily associates with the string-like particles that are found throughout the wetland. When iron latches onto these particles, like beads on a string, it is free to migrate up and down the soil until it encounters the U-4 aggregates. Only then can the U-4 latch on to the iron ""beads"" and be carried out of the wetland and into the stream.

When the conditions outlined above are met, the mobility of uranium thought to be sequestered in wetlands might be underestimated. At the same time, this research suggests a novel strategy that could help improve the efficiency of wetlands at capturing waterborne uranium: if the bacteria are given enough sulfate, they release sulfide which sequesters iron, decreasing the amount of iron available, and effectively stopping the chain of events well before uranium is remobilized.","Tue, 17 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,"['u4', 'uranium', 'researchers', 'u6', 'mobile', 'remobilized', 'wetlands', 'iron', 'iv', 'natural', 'form', 'wetland']",

Authorities say a golden urn, said to contain hair, teeth and bones from the Buddha, was taken last week from a shrine near the capital.

Five suspects have been arrested so far, but the demonstrators said Tuesday that authorities have been slow to act in prosecuting the case or finding the missing urn.

Demonstrators and monks marched through the rain, carrying banners with messages decrying corruption and the theft of the urn. One sign read, “The loss of Buddha’s relics are a loss of Khmer national heritage.”

Sin Sopheasit, a demonstrating monk, said concrete action needs to be taken.

“The action taken by head monks does not satisfy me because the relics, which were the symbol of our people and the entirety of Buddhism for our nation, were stolen and there is lack of effort to search for them.""

The demonstration ended peacefully after Buddhist officials promised to push the government to quicken the pace of its investigation.

The relics came to Cambodia from Sri Lanka in 1957.

You have no idea who’s going to be over and what they’re going to be doing and who they brought with them that you get to meet.”

If the Embassy is the Four Seasons of San Francisco’s commune scene, Langton is the hostel that took its decorating cues from the A&E show “Hoarders.” On the Thursday before Halloween, an overflowing blue Dumpster stood before a kitchen, which contained an array of potted plants amid dozens of spice bottles, a jar of Vegemite and a pumpkin.

The compound had just received a half-dozen boxes of dead animals. Mr. Partensky said the carcasses would be used to make chimeras (creatures made up of parts from different species) during a coming Halloween party, and pointed to a fetal pig with owl’s wings hovering over the garage.

The atmosphere at Langton is not usually so Dionysian. Mr. Partensky, who was born in the Soviet Union and lived in a refugee community in Italy as a child, started the space with a group that included his sister, a carpenter, and a clown because, he said, he fantasized about a place where “the distance between questions and answers would be shorter because you could walk down the hall to ask someone with that expertise.” (He’s building Sourcery, a service that helps restaurants, hospitals and other large organizations place bulk orders of food, with a former housemate.)

Since Langton opened six years ago, Mr. Partensky estimates about 1,000 short- and long-term guests have stayed there, each paying upward of $1,200 a month in rent. Unlike in the old days, lost souls can’t saunter off a Volkswagen bus and expect a bed (and a toke); Langton, the Embassy and others have rigorous application processes for prospective residents, with questions like: “If you had a superpower, what would it be?” Mr. North was interviewed by 10 of 11 prospective housemates before being accepted into the Embassy. (At some communes, friends of residents looking for a place to crash can claim a bunk in a shared room for $30 to $40 a night.)

The Sub has functioned as a communal space for decades, but in recent years it has been frequented by a techie crowd. Over vegan chili and kale salad at one of its recent monthly dinners, arranged through Facebook, Mr. Lane-Smith asked each of the nine attendees to share their name, a phrase about their day and what they were really excited about. Phrases included “heads down” from a software developer focused on producing “quantity over quality” and “serendipity” from a video game designer who bonded with her fellow Caltrain commuter riders that morning when their train was delayed by a suicide.","Thu, 12 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/12/fashion/20131212-COMMUNES-slide-OKED/20131212-COMMUNES-slide-OKED-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=9ed93b969a34ff0067471d546ab084812dfa2ecad7b532da760ec60e732dde40&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"['questions', 'space', 'mr', 'residents', 'langton', 'sub', 'recent', 'flocking', 'partensky', 'bay', 'area', 'millennials', 'communes', 'place', 'embassy']",

73,73,FL-2013-000155-IDN,Australia: Asylum seekers held in cruel and prison-like regime on Manus Island - Amnesty International,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2013/12/australia-asylum-seekers-held-cruel-and-prison-regime-manus-island/,"The Australian government is holding more than 1,000 asylum seekers in shameful conditions in a processing centre on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, said Amnesty International.

A report published today details how asylum seekers are being held in a prison-like regime, in extremely cramped compounds in stifling heat, while being denied sufficient water and medical help. Most have fled horrific situations and risked their lives in their efforts to reach Australia.

“This system of harsh conditions and humiliating treatment is a deliberate effort to pressure people to return to the desperate situations they have fled from. Australia is directly responsible for this deplorable and unlawful combination of arbitrary detention and inhumane conditions,” said Amnesty International Australia’s National Director Claire Mallinson.

“The policy of shipping asylum seekers, many of whom have suffered terribly in their home countries, to offshore facilities has to end.”

Amnesty International’s report This Is Breaking People: Human Rights Violations at Australia’s Asylum Seeker Processing Centre on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea is based on a recent 11-16 November research visit to Manus Island. It details the appalling conditions in the centre, where only 55 out of more than 1,000 asylum seekers have been able to start a claim for refugee status.

“The Australian policy is cruelly ironic. Australia recognizes the dangerous situation in countries like Syria and Myanmar. It knows these people have risked life and limb to escape, but then they are held in prison- like conditions and denied their right to seek asylum,” said Claire Mallinson.

Many of the asylum seekers being held on Manus Island have fled well-known conflict areas including Afghanistan, Darfur, Pakistan, Somalia and Syria. Others have fled situations of extreme discrimination and statelessness, including Rohingyas from Myanmar and Bidun from the Gulf region, and have nowhere to return to.

Some told how they have contemplated suicide because of the harsh and humiliating conditions.

One 43-year old Iraqi said: “I have lived in war zones, with bombs and explosions. I have never experienced what I am experiencing here with the uncertainty we face. If we had died in the ocean that would have been better.”

The inhumane treatment is pressuring potential refugees to choose to return to their country of origin. This is a serious breach of Australia’s obligations under international law, exposing the individuals to the risk of return to places where they will likely be persecuted or potentially tortured.

The Manus Island Regional Processing Centre (RPC) is essentially an Australian-run facility based on Papua New Guinean soil. Australian authorities are closely involved in every aspect of the arrest, transfer, and detention of asylum seekers. It also contracts the security guards, service and health providers, and has overall involvement in the day-to-day running of the facility.

Harsh and deliberate cruelty - conditions of everyday life

At the time of Amnesty International’s visit, there were approximately 1,100 male asylum seekers in the facility, divided between three “compounds”, Delta, Foxtrot and Oscar. Each compound is surrounded by eight feet high metal fences and patrolled by security guards contracted by the Australian government.

The compounds are extremely cramped, leave no room for privacy and provide no shade or shelter from the oppressive tropical heat, humidity and heavy rain. Detainees spend several hours a day queuing in the sun for their meals.

Foxtrot’s P Dorm is particularly concerning and violates obligations under the UN Convention against Torture. It has a corrugated iron roof, no windows and only two small working fans to be shared between 112 men in overcrowded conditions.

“The mixture of stifling heat, sweat and moisture leaves a permanent, overwhelming stench. Asylum seekers reported finding snakes in the room and flooding when it rained,” said Claire Mallinson.

The men also told how drinking water has been denied in Oscar compound – where detainees receive only a tenth of what they need.

Inadequate health and communication facilities

The facility is unable to provide suitable treatment for men with serious illnesses and disabilities, including asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, gastroenteritis and dwarfism.

The facility cannot cope with the growing demand for health and mental health services. Medical staff are frustrated at the lack of response from Australian authorities to basic requests which would improve health and sanitation within the camp.

Verbal and physical abuse

Amnesty International also heard testimonies of humiliating treatment from the moment the men are transferred to the RPC. Detainees are mainly referred to by their boat ID numbers, and many cite cases of verbal and physical abuse by staff, including being kicked, punched and shoved.

“This is the process of how you break someone mentally. These conditions are contributing to a range of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, lack of sleep and trauma, especially for men from war zones,” said one medical professional.

Lack of processing

The policy of offshore processing means that individuals are denied the right to seek asylum on arrival in Australia. However, not a single refugee decision has been handed down by the PNG government since the policy began in late 2012.

There is little or no processing at the Manus Island RPC. Slow processing times seem deliberately designed to dissuade potential refugees and pressure detainees to return to countries from where they have fled.

“Given the exorbitant amount already spent on this processing centre, it is entirely unacceptable that only a handful of detainees have just started to have their cases looked at seriously,” said Claire Mallinson.

The asylum seekers are given no information about the processing or the length of their detention, and have been given no access to lawyers despite repeated requests. The suspense and uncertainty is seriously damaging to their mental health.

Recommendations

The current policy of offshore processing is a spectacular failure on all fronts.

Amnesty International calls on the Australian government to immediately review the Regional Resettlement Arrangement with Papua New Guinea and end offshore processing and the offshore detention of asylum seekers. All asylum seekers held in the Manus Island detention centre must be transferred back to Australian territory and given full access to asylum procedures in Australia.

Until the Manus Island detention centre is closed and all asylum seekers held there are transferred to Australian territory, the Australian government must take immediate steps to improve conditions on the facility so that they meet international standards. Among them, putting an end to abusive treatment, no longer using P Dorm as housing, providing adequate medical services and making sure individuals are not pressured to return to a country where they are at risk of persecution or other ill-treatment.

Both the Australian and PNG governments need to urgently ensure a fair and effective system of processing is in place, and they must work with other governments in the region towards a genuine regional solution that protects the rights of asylum seekers and refugees in accordance with international human rights and refugee law.","Wed, 11 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://aineupstrmediaprd.blob.core.windows.net:443/media/3753/184656_manus_island_detention_centre.jpg?preset=fixed_1200_630,"['manus', 'asylum', 'island', 'held', 'return', 'regime', 'cruel', 'processing', 'international', 'centre', 'australian', 'prisonlike', 'seekers', 'conditions', 'australia']",

Tina Thompson, 69, from Rutherwyke Close, Stoneleigh, had defrosted the supermarket's prawns for brunch so gave some to her cats and planned to feed the cats’ leftovers to the birds the next day.

She said: ""I had completely forgotten about Halloween. We heard a group of children in the road and we turned the lights off.""

But the bid to avoid bother from trick-or-treaters had unexpected consequences when her husband noticed the prawns glowing on a saucer in the dark kitchen.

Mrs Thompson, a former Mayor of Wandsworth, said: ""Just to make sure I had not gone completely mad I took this saucer nextdoor to show my neighbour.

""They were still glowing the next morning when I went down to Waitrose. I took them down in a box and said ‘if you go into a dark room you will see they are glowing’.""

After the visit to Waitrose in Stone Place, Worcester Park, she received letters from the customer sales and support team, seen by the Epsom Guardian, in which they say that prawns are sometimes caught with plankton and the bacteria may be Pseudomonas fluorescens which is harmless.

But Mrs Thompson remains dissatisfied with their answers.

She said: ""They have not told me what species of plankton or bacteria survives boiling and freezing. I don’t think it is an unreasonable request to know what I have eaten.""

She even wondered if radioactive water from a leaking atomic power station in Japan could reach Indonesia where the prawns were farmed.

She said: ""It’s probably highly unlikely but I feel I would like to be reassured. I would like to know the species so I could go to the Natural History Museum, contact the New Scientist or look it up online.""

Mrs Thompson represented Southfields on Wandsworth Council for 16 years and was the Mayor of Wandsworth from 1997 to 1998.

She said: ""I really don’t like being fobbed off. I’m a very determined lady. I wrote to Waitrose and said I was severely disappointed.

""If they are going to treat a loyal customer with such disregard, and what I consider contempt, I don’t want to shop there anymore. It’s a reasonable question, I don’t want them to sweep it under the carpet.""

A Waitrose spokesman said: ""Bacteria is all around us and although we don’t see this occur very often but occasionally naturally-occurring, harmless bacteria (known as photobacterium) may be found on fish and shellfish.

""At certain temperatures and certain times of year - even after freezing or cooking - these may be seen to ‘glow’.

""We appreciate how this may be startling if someone sees this for the first time but would reassure any customer that this is harmless and is safe to eat.

""Nevertheless, if any customer is unhappy with any product bought from us we are happy to provide a refund and replacement.

""We take feedback on all our products very seriously and investigate this with our suppliers. In this instance, we believe this to be an isolated case.""

""We have written to Mrs Thompson directly and would like to apologise for any concern caused.""

After reports of glow-in-the-dark shrimp in the US state of Oregon in 2010, Kaety Hildenbrand, an Oregon State University sea grant extension specialist said the phenomena it is actually surprisingly common.

She said: ""One person turned her lights off to watch a movie and her shrimp salad started to glow. Another man left his pink shrimp on the counter to thaw, and when he got up, it was glowing in the sink.

""People are calling to ask about safety and we’re assuring them there’s nothing wrong with their seafood.""

Marine bacteria can cause luminescence when it grows on seafood products and salt added during process can exacerbate the trait.

79,79,FL-2013-000155-IDN,Europe's New Basic Research Chief Ready to Defend Fundamental Science - Science Now,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/12/europes-new-basic-research-chief-ready-defend-fundamental-science,"Today, the European Commission announced that French mathematician Jean-Pierre Bourguignon has been appointed the new president of the European Research Council (ERC), the European Union’s main funding agency for basic research. (News of his appointment leaked in late October, but the commission did not confirm it at the time.)

Bourguignon, who will formally start on 1 January, comes to the agency just at the start of Horizon 2020, the European Union’s new 7-year research program, in which ERC sees its budget increase to about €13 billion, or almost €2 billion annually. That’s almost double its budget under Horizon 2020’s 7-year predecessor, which ends this month.

Bourguignon retired in August after 19 years at the helm of the Institute of Advanced Scientific Studies, a private institute near Paris; he has also been a fellow at France's National Center for Scientific Research for the past 45 years. ScienceInsider talked to Bourguignon about his views and plans; questions and answers have been edited for brevity and clarity.

Q: Why did you decide to take the job?

J.-P.B.: There are three sides to it. The first is that I’m a very convinced European. I’ve worked to better organize science at the European level and I feel that European science needs a strong voice. If you ask scientists what the greatest success for science in the European Union is, many will say: the ERC. So being involved in that was very natural to me.

Second, the ERC was the first time the European Commission really made a strong commitment to fundamental research. That has to be defended; you need to make the case again, and again, and again. Fundamental research has made an absolutely crucial contribution to high technology, but governments don’t always see that because the relationship is a subtle one.

I want to get the support from companies for this as well. They realize the importance of fundamental research, and I think they can play a very important role in gaining politicians’ sympathy for the ERC. To politicians, a sentence by a big company boss is worth a petition signed by 10,000 scientists.

The third and last point has to do with the ERC itself. I chaired an ERC committee for Starting Grants, one of the very first, and it was a fantastic experience. My panel was really great. It was extremely hard work, because the ERC was flooded with applications, but we survived and learned a lot from each other as mathematicians. I enjoyed this environment and I very much appreciated the people working at the ERC. It looked to me like a place where good work could be continued.

Q: What will change under your leadership?

J.-P.B.: Now that ERC has been successful so quickly, we enter a second phase, which will be quite different. The amount of money now coming through the ERC, almost €2 billion per year, is substantial enough that one has to think of its impact on the way research is organized at the European level. I hope to engage in discussions with funding agencies in various E.U. countries and say: You should take the ERC funding into account and maybe change the way you are funding research yourself a little bit.

Q: Change their funding … in what way?

J.-P.B.: If you look at France, for example, traditionally, there was no money available to fund projects. In the past 10 years, this has shifted completely; now everything is project-based, and the money coming on a regular, recurrent basis in the laboratories has basically gone to zero. It’s absolutely critical that the government acknowledges that there is now money available from Europe for the very best researchers, and instead of putting money on projects, makes funds available on a regular basis.

Q: So you’re advocating a move away from project-based funding at the national level?

J.-P.B.: In some cases, yes. Labs that have proved their capacity at attracting very good grants should not be forced again at the national level to submit proposals. So much time is taken writing proposals, it is disconcerting. In light of the massive project funding coming from Europe, countries have to rethink the balance.

Q: Many countries have fared poorly in the competition for grants, especially in southern and Eastern Europe, and this has sowed discontent. What do you tell those countries?

J.-P.B.: The answer isn’t obvious at all. But we must absolutely not go to the situation where every country gets out of the ERC what they put into it -- the principle of juste retour, as the French call it. That would be the worst idea.

There are various reasons why countries don’t do well. Sometimes the level of science just isn't high enough; then that has to be addressed in itself. The most successful country, in absolute numbers, is the U.K., and one of the reasons they have done so well is that the British universities have teams looking for money all the time. They detect potentially successful ERC candidates outside Great Britain and say: “We will help you with the application if you come to Britain.” This has been especially successful for candidates from Eastern Europe. Other countries could try the same approach.

And there are other things we can do. We can make sure that when a person wants to go back to his or her country after an ERC grant, they’re accompanied properly at the European level. Many scientists come back stronger and with more experience, and they are in a position to lift their country up.

We do have to monitor this issue closely; we don’t want to create a situation where politicians in central and Eastern Europe say: “Sorry, but this is totally catastrophic for us.” That could kill the ERC.

Q: Will you make changes in ERC’s existing grants?

J.-P.B.: There have been two rounds of Synergy Grants [a grant for small interdisciplinary groups of researchers that started in 2012]. What I have seen from the outside doesn't give me a very good impression of it. They are completely cross-discipline, and the juries are of course completely cross-discipline as well. But it’s very difficult to come up with appropriate evaluators, because these grants are very forward-looking frontier projects. You need very specific scientists to do that.

What I have seen are reports on projects which were rejected. One report I saw was completely absurd; evaluators clearly were incompetent to give any opinion on the project. And there are too many instances of that. So this program needs to be reviewed very, very carefully.

Q: You are the first ERC president to work from ERC’s Executive Agency in Brussels; your job will include the responsibilities of ERC’s secretary-general, Donald Dingwell, who’s stepping down; you will also be a special adviser to the European Commission. Some experts warn that it will be difficult to maintain your independence from the European Commission.

J.-P.B.: Yes, the position has changed somewhat, and I think this will require new ways of functioning. I will be in the building very often. But after my first contacts with Pablo Amor, the director of the Executive Agency, I’m not worried about this.

There is another issue, however. My predecessor, Helga Nowotny, used her independence to freely express her opinions. My concern is that, with the president becoming a special adviser to the commission, it will be difficult for me to say what I think without first making sure that people around the commissioner or the Directorate-General for Research and Innovation won’t object -- especially if I disagree with the commission.

I am not the kind of person not to say what I mean, so we need to carefully monitor this balance and make sure that as a scientist, I have the possibility to express myself. Of course, my new position also gives me a fantastic opportunity to discuss the important issues with the political people and the administration, and I hope to take advantage of that.","Tue, 17 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/si-Bourguignon.jpg?itok=2vmbKBlg,"['research', 'ready', 'funding', 'european', 'fundamental', 'money', 'europe', 'chief', 'level', 'europes', 'say', 'grants', 'countries', 'basic', 'defend', 'erc', 'science']",

81,81,FL-2013-000155-IDN,"Komodo dragon, 5 other reptiles die in fire at San Antonio Zoo - San Antonio Express",https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Komodo-dragon-5-other-reptiles-die-in-fire-at-5068267.php,"SAN ANTONIO — Officials at the San Antonio Zoo will have to raise at least $100,000 to rebuild the enclosure damaged by a Monday fire that killed a Komodo dragon and five other reptiles.

The zoo's female Komodo dragon, Scatha, and the other animals died of smoke inhalation during the early-morning fire, authorities said.

A hot mat, which the zoo's Komodo dragons lie on to keep warm, shorted because of a problem with a fuse or breaker box, zoo Director Steve McCusker said.

“It's depressing,” he said. “Everybody's got sort of a lump in their stomach.”

Scatha, 15, was described as a favorite among zoo staff and guests.

Komodo dragons are the heaviest lizards on Earth, reaching 10 feet in length and more than 300 pounds. Their life span exceeds 30 years.

The lizards will eat other animals — live or carrion — including deer, pigs, smaller dragons, water buffalo and humans, according to National Geographic. In zoos, they are fed rodents, rabbits and other meat, in addition to eggs.

Anything bitten by a Komodo dragon usually dies of blood poisoning within 24 hours, according to National Geographic. Just four years ago, researchers determined that the animals produce venom in addition to the deadly bacterial strains found in their mouths.

ProFauna Indonesia chairman Rosek Nursahid told Indonesian news outlets in 2009 that a baby Komodo dragon could cost 40 million Indonesian rupiahs, or $4,400. Other news reports have put the black market cost as high as $30,000.

Zoo officials said Monday that they were planning to get a replacement Komodo dragon but did not have an initial estimate of how much it would cost.

Officials continued working late Monday to determine whether the electrical problem that caused Scatha's death originated in the hot mat or in a wall, traveling down wires to short out the mat, zoo spokeswoman Debbie Rios-Vanskike said.

There were no large flames, but the building filled with smoke, McCusker said. The Fire Department extinguished the small blaze in 10 to 15 minutes, he said.

McCusker said a reptile keeper smelled smoke in the two-story enclosure around 6 a.m. and began evacuating the animals. Zookeepers were able to evacuate the male Komodo dragon, Bubba, 20, from the first floor. Scatha was already dead, officials said.

The zoo also lost two Amazon tree boas, two Solomon skink lizards and a Red Mountain racer snake, officials said. They were all kept on the second floor of the building, and all died of smoke inhalation.

Zoo officials said 92 other reptiles, kept on the second floor of the enclosure for research and breeding purposes, were moved into other holding areas during the fire. One of the reptiles was a reticulated python.

McCusker estimated that the smoke damage would cost $100,000 to repair and that the process would take six to eight months.

“It is unfortunate that during the cleanup phase some impressive creatures will be temporarily unavailable for public enjoyment,” McCusker said.

The zoo has kept and bred Komodo dragons for at least 15 years after acquiring them from other zoos. Scatha came to the zoo six years ago from the Houston Zoo, Rios-Vanskike said. Visitors came in droves when she and Bubba had babies.

“The Komodo dragon itself is a big draw,” Rios-Vanskike said. “People like to see that.”

Komodo dragons hail from the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia, according to National Geographic. They lived there for millions of years before humans discovered them about a century ago.

They camouflage themselves while they wait for their prey, springing to bite the other animal. The dragons will follow their prey for miles as the poison takes effect. After the prey is dead, the dragon can eat up to 80 percent of its body weight, according to National Geographic.

Komodo dragon attacks in the wild are rare. Two people were killed from 2007 to 2009, according to an Associated Press report.

In captivity, one of the highest-profile attacks occurred in 2001 when then-San Francisco Chronicle executive editor Phil Bronstein was bitten at the Los Angeles Zoo during a visit with actress Sharon Stone, his wife at the time. Bronstein suffered a serious foot injury but survived.

Komodo dragons are endangered because of a lack of egg-laying females, poaching, human encroachment and natural disasters, according to National Geographic.

The timing of the fire right before Christmas, one of the zoo's biggest days, should not change anything in terms of attendance, Rios-Vanskike said.

When the weather is nice, “a couple thousand” people come to the zoo on Christmas Day, she said.

“This institution has 9,000 animals,” she said. “It has 750 species. There's always something you can see.”

The zoo's reptile house, which is separate from the Komodo dragon enclosure, was not affected by the fire.

The zoo will have to raise the money to fix the enclosure, but it is also fundraising for giraffes and for its 2014 centennial celebration, Rios-Vanskike said.

Officials are asking for the public's help in dealing with the financial hit.","Mon, 16 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://s.hdnux.com/photos/25/30/67/5606850/3/rawImage.jpg,"['smoke', 'komodo', 'officials', 'antonio', 'national', 'zoo', 'san', 'according', 'riosvanskike', 'dragon', 'dragons', 'reptiles', 'zoos', 'die']",

84,84,FL-2013-000155-IDN,The Thousand-Year Graveyard - Science Now,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/12/thousand-year-graveyard,"BADIA POZZEVERI CHURCHYARD, ALTOPASCIO, ITALY—On a hot afternoon in July 2012, Giuseppe Vercellotti was digging up bones near the wall of an abandoned medieval church here, thinking about getting a cold drink, when he heard his students call his name. Faces glistening with sweat, they told him that they had found something strange buried half a meter down. Vercellotti took a look and saw a layer of lime, used in ancient times to squelch the stench of rotting corpses. When he tapped the hard layer with his trowel, it sounded hollow. “We immediately thought it was a mass grave,” says Vercellotti, a biological anthropologist at Ohio State University, Columbus, who co-leads a field school here. “We instructors were all excited and hopeful.”

But the students were apprehensive: “They all started talking about possible contagion,” Vercellotti says. Unconcerned, he leaned deep into the trench, where he got a whiff of a pungent odor and spotted an elbow bone poking out of the lime that had sealed it like a cast. The layer spoke of bodies tossed into a pit and hastily covered with lime. Could this trench hold victims of the Black Death, the plague that killed half of Europe in the Middle Ages?

It was the end of the summer field season. So the team carefully covered the trench with tarps and went home, hoping that excavations in 2013 would show that they had struck gold. They had come to expect extraordinary finds in the graveyard of the now decrepit Abbey of St. Peter, where a bountiful store of ancient skeletons was laid to rest in a single place over 1000 years, from the 11th to the 19th centuries. The goal of the ongoing project is to read the history written in these bones: when and where these people were born, what they ate, what diseases they suffered and died from, and how their health varied by social class and over time. “This is a superb opportunity to learn about life in the medieval period and how it evolved and changed over that time and into the Renaissance and Industrial era,” says project co-leader Clark Spencer Larsen, a biological anthropologist at Ohio State.

Helped by locals who house and feed 30 students for 6 weeks each summer, the interdisciplinary team of 12 researchers is now in its third year of excavations. Their work is set apart not just by the extraordinary site but also by the variety of tools used to learn the secrets of the bones, from scanning them with 3D computed tomography to extracting isotopes from the teeth. In an unusual collaboration, this year the team brought along an ancient DNA expert to sample for ancient pathogens.

Because the abbey stood beside an ancient pilgrimage route, the results could help track the spread of disease through Europe. DNA from ancient microbes could also help today’s medical researchers keep one step ahead of fast-evolving diseases like cholera and influenza. “What you’re seeing at Badia Pozzeveri is hypothesis testing not only on bones, but also using pathogens and cultural factors,” says bioarchaeologist George Armelagos of Emory University in Atlanta, who is not part of the project. “It’s going to be the poster child for future work in bioarchaeology.”

The burials begin (1039 to 1300 C.E.)

One afternoon while the students ate lunch, University of Pisa archaeologist Antonio Fornaciari gave a tour of the trenches, pointing to a freshly excavated stone wall beneath an asphalt parking lot in area 4000 (see graphic). In the 12th and 13th centuries, this wall ran along the inner sanctum of the monastery (see video of church). Monks of the Camaldolese branch of the Benedictine order lived here, surrounded by a tall wall and moat, at the edge of marshes and oak woods, according to the town’s official history.

In this courtyard, the team found two partial skeletons, buried between 1200 C.E. and 1300 C.E. in a place of honor that suggests they were monks. The anthropologists are now examining their remains to answer a key question: Did monks have better health than farmers or peasants?

Stature is one clue to health, and most medieval Europeans were short. European men averaged 167 centimeters in the Middle Ages (compared with 178 cm today), and shrank by 5.4 cm by the end of the period. The team thinks that with the rise in population, more people competed for food and resources. The bones at Badia Pozzeveri could confirm a trend toward scarcer food and worse health as the Middle Ages progressed.

The bones could also show whether monks were exceptions. Historical records suggest that monks did eat better than peasants—and that both had poorer diets than nobles. To begin the analysis, Vercellotti laid out the leg bones of one monk on a table in the makeshift lab inside the church, below a ceiling covered with faded frescoes. He measured the lengths of thighbone and shinbone and made a “very preliminary” height estimate of 165 to 170 cm. A better estimate might give him a clue to the monks’ status: High-status medieval men buried in one churchyard in northern Italy averaged 171 cm, while lower status men averaged 164 cm, according to a study he published in 2011 in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology. The team has also dug up the likely remains of peasants, probably dating from the 11th century—two poorly preserved skeletons found outside the wall—and they’re hoping for more.

Pilgrims also passed right by the church as they followed the main highway of the Middle Ages, the Via Francigena or “road that comes from France.” Knights, clerics, and peasants all traveled this route (see locator map), leaving traces such as two rare Islamic jugs from North Arabia, found in the cloister this summer. With the travelers came new diseases. Leprosy, for example, may have arrived from the Middle East with the Crusaders. It swept into Tuscany in the 12th century, when four leprosariums sprang up in the area, including one run by the monks. The pilgrims probably also spread many diseases including smallpox, measles, tuberculosis (TB), and typhus.

Those are just the sort of infectious company that Hendrik Poinar seeks. An ancient DNA expert at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, he jumped at the rare chance get DNA from pathogens over time in a single location. He wants to see how many diseases people of each period had to combat and how fast pathogens evolved in different conditions, such as famine and war.

One morning, as Poinar watched, Vercellotti and a graduate student laid out one skull after another on a long table. Poinar looked at the excellently preserved teeth in a freshly excavated jaw. Teeth are a promising source of ancient DNA. “This is it—this is what we came for,” he said.

“Dig in,” said Vercellotti, holding a skull steady. Poinar adjusted his facemask, pulled up his rubber gloves, and yanked a tooth out of a jaw with pliers. “Skilled dentistry,” he joked. If he does get DNA from these teeth, he’ll test it for everything from leprosy to plague to TB.

The worst century (1300 to 1400 C.E.)

The next day, Poinar knelt head down over a trench in area 2000, trying to excavate a jaw with teeth protruding from the wall of the pit. The team hadn’t yet gotten radiocarbon dates from this trench, but they thought it might be from the 14th century, a time of devastating infections including the Black Death, which killed half of Europe from 1348 to 1350. The teeth glistened in the dirt wall, but the jaw was firmly embedded. “I’ve been drooling over them for 4 days,” Poinar said.

Earlier that week, he had explained why. He gave a presentation in the church and flashed a slide about a news story about a plague-infected squirrel that closed campgrounds near Los Angeles. “Killer squirrels are coming!” he joked.

But it’s no joke to ask if killer strains of plague could return. In 2011, Poinar was part of a team that gathered ancient DNA from people who died in London between 1348 to 1349, apparently of plague. The scientists identified the cause of the Black Death as the bacterium Yersinia pestis, rather than anthrax or a mix of pathogens, as some had suspected. This ancient strain was almost identical to a Y. pestis strain that still circulates in small rodents in the southwestern United States, Africa, and Asia. But today, Y. pestis, although still deadly, infects only about 1000 to 3000 people annually and is transmitted slowly from person to person.

Why is this Y. pestis strain so much less virulent today, and why does it only rarely move from rodents to humans? Poinar is one of several geneticists in a neck-to-neck race to find out. They’re trying to learn when and why the Black Death strain jumped from rodents to humans, and what made it spread so rapidly. Was it mutations in the genome of Y. pestis or changes in the susceptibility of animal or human hosts—or both? “If we study humans before, during, and after the plague, we should see how the human genome responded to these repeated outbreaks and the response in bacteria,” Poinar says.

That’s why he is seeking the Black Death in Badia Pozzeveri, where cases were recorded in 1348 before the epidemic reached northern Europe. He’ll compare that strain—newly arrived from Asia—with that of the London victims to see if the plague evolved as it tore through Europe. He also can see if plague victims suffered from TB or other infections, to test the idea that 14th century people harbored so many pathogens that they were more susceptible to plague.

Another theory behind the deadliness of plague is that it was hard for anyone in Europe to survive that terrible century. Before the plague hit, the continent had been pounded by bad weather, failing crops, famine, and war. Torrential rains in 1315 and 1316 flooded crops and caused the Great Famine. The Little Ice Age had begun, triggering frigid winters that destroyed more crops. In England, between 1348 and 1375, life expectancy at birth was only 17 years, according to parish records. Overall health, as shown by seven indicators in teeth and bones, plummeted to an all-time low in the 14th century, according to a study of 17,250 individuals from 100 locations in Europe by Ohio State economic historian Richard Steckel, Larsen, and their colleagues in the Global History of Health Project (Science, 1 May 2009, p. 588).

Disease may even have influenced the outcome of battles among the Italian city-states, which came right to the doorstep of the church at Pozzeveri. In September 1325, Florence’s commander Ramon de Cardona camped at the abbey with most of his 3000 cavalry and 15,000 infantry. The nobles moved into the monastery itself, while the troops probably camped in a field west of the church, near what was then a large lake and swamp. Many got sick.

That may be why Cardona made a move that still puzzles historians: He lingered at Badia Pozzeveri for two long weeks while his rival, the legendary Castruccio Castracani from Lucca, recruited reinforcements. Castracani had far fewer troops at first. But by the time Cardona advanced on 23 September, Castracani’s army outnumbered the Florentines, many of who retreated before the battle had even begun. It was a rout, and Castracani became a hero whose military victories were immortalized by Machiavelli.

Just what sickened Cardona’s men? Fornaciari suspects malaria because they complained of mala ariae, or bad air. He convinced Poinar to test for that disease, too. “One of our hopes is to discover if malaria is present in the medieval period,” Fornaciari says, because it is not clear when the illness first reached Tuscany.

Another hope is to find the remains of those who died in that famous battle, because relatively few groups of soldiers killed in war have been found in Europe, Larsen says. Three spearheads have turned up so far in area 4000. Human remains would provide the first good physical “record of injuries from the kinds of weapons available in 1325,” Larsen says. “They were doing some really horrible things to each other. They had this square hammer-headed mace for bashing in skulls.”

Noble secrets (1400 to 1600 C.E.)

One July morning, project co-director Gino Fornaciari dropped by the church. There he found his former student, Vercellotti, examining teeth with Poinar. “Why are the teeth so good?” Poinar asked. Fornaciari replied: “They’re young. The teeth are good because the normal age of death was 40.” He pointed out that the tooth wear can also reveal whether someone ate many tough grains such as coarse millet, or a more refined, soft diet.

When it comes to reading the signature of disease and foul play in the bones of ancient people, Fornaciari is the master. A professor in the medical school at the University of Pisa and the father of team member Antonio Fornaciari, he’s famous for investigating the lives and deaths of the ancient nobility of Italy, including the Medici of Florence, who lived just 60 km from Badia Pozzeveri.

This site offers him and the others a rare chance to examine the health of commoners as well as nobles during the Renaissance. They have already found people of various social classes, buried in area 3000 from 1500 to 1700. One woman was buried with her spectacles—an expensive and treasured accessory—and several skeletons were interred in a costly stone-lined vault inside the ancient church. But most of the bones were buried in wooden coffins outside the churchyard and probably were those of poorer rural people, whose daily lives are less well known than the nobility of cities.

Commoners’ bones will provide a counterpoint to Fornaciari’s work elsewhere revealing the woeful condition of the well-fed nobility. In Naples, he examined the mummy of Maria d’Aragona, a noblewoman who lived from 1503 to 1568 and was a famed beauty in her youth—but was obese at death. That fits with what he has learned about her fellow nobles’ diet. In 2008, Fornaciari analyzed carbon and nitrogen ratios in bone collagen from other princes of Naples and the Medici of Florence, and found that they had as much nitrogen in their diet as carnivorous mammals. Clearly, Renaissance royalty ate unhealthy quantities of meat at a time when many rural people struggled to get enough calories.

Nor was rank a protection against horrific infectious diseases. When Fornaciari cut off a linen bandage from Maria d’Aragona’s arm, he discovered a large ulcer. He examined the tissue with a scanning electron microscope and rinsed it with antibodies that fluoresce in the presence of the bacteria that cause syphilis, Treponema pallidum. The tissue was so well preserved that he could detect the spiral shape of the bacteria; he sent tissue to Poinar to confirm the diagnosis. Poor Maria also harbored human papillomavirus in a venereal wart—the first diagnosis of this sexually transmitted, cancer-causing disease in the tissue of a mummy, Fornaciari reported in a 2006 paper.

Sexually transmitted diseases were common in Renaissance Italy. Syphilis raced through the country in the 1500s, possibly after Spanish sailors brought a new venereal form from the New World. Fornaciari also examined Maria’s distant relative, Isabella d’Aragona, who was also buried in Naples. She was married to the Duke of Milan and is thought by many to be the model for Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. When Fornaciari looked closely at this lady’s teeth, he found that they had been abraded to remove most of the enamel. The remaining enamel traces were black, a sign that she had taken mercury, which was then used—ineffectively—to treat syphilis. Lab tests confirmed that the black patina had a high level of mercury and that Isabella d’Aragona was poisoned by her own medicine, dying at age 54 in 1524.

By comparing the teeth and bones of urban nobles with those of Pozzeveri peasants, the team hopes to see how social rank affected health. The teeth of the noblewomen are less worn, because they ate a softer diet with meat, whereas poorer women and children often ate coarse millet. Vercellotti and Larsen expect to see more disruptions in tooth growth caused by lack of food during childhood in the peasants. With the graveyard’s large sample sizes, they hope to compare the men and women of Badia Pozzeveri to see who was better fed.

The mass grave

Almost a year after Vercellotti first tapped his trowel on the bed of lime, he and a crowd of students set to the task of systemically uncovering the entombed skeletons in area 1000. They chipped away the cementlike lime and tried to avoid inhaling the powdery white dust. Once they broke through the shell in early July, they brushed and scooped away the soil, sometimes with teaspoons. They found that each skeleton was buried separately, but all were blanketed in lime.

One skeleton clutched a cross, head to the side, jaw agape. Another had a twisted spine, likely evidence of scoliosis. All had been buried in shrouds and were lying in unusual positions as though they had been dumped hurriedly. Everything fit the hypothesis that they were victims of an epidemic.

The researchers carefully uncovered another exceptionally complete skeleton—an older woman, as shown by her frail bones and worn teeth. She was lying on her side, probably in the same position in which she died. In the soil beneath her, they could see the impression of her fingers and ear, and the lines left by her bodice’s laces. “I loved excavating her,” Vercellotti said. “She was beautiful,” Gino Fornaciari agreed. Beneath her skull, they found a single, golden hoop earring, and they began to call her the Lady with the Gold Earring.

That earring was a clue: This was no medieval matron. The hoop style, as well as buttons and fasteners for clothing found with other skeletons, showed that these people died in the mid-1800s—too late to be victims of the Black Death. So what did kill them?

To find out, Poinar and Vercellotti pulled teeth from their skulls and scooped soil from where their stomachs once lay, seeking to sample and identify the pathogen’s DNA. They already have a working hypothesis: cholera.

In 1855, this terrible diarrheal disease, transmitted by the waterborne bacterium Vibrio cholerae, swept through Italy, part of a worldwide pandemic. Poinar is just as eager to find DNA from V. cholerae as from plague, because tracing the evolution of cholera is still urgent today.

Like other pathogens, V. cholerae keeps evolving into new forms, and it continues to erupt into worldwide pandemics. Since the 1960s, the seventh known pandemic has infected 3 million to 4 million people and killed nearly 100,000 every year, with a new strain causing particular devastation in Haiti recently. If researchers can trace the bacterium’s evolutionary history, they might be able to identify the key mutations that trigger virulence or adaptation to different habitats, for example. This could help them design better vaccines or medicines.

Poinar has already sequenced a sample of mid-19th century cholera from the United States. The researchers gathered DNA from a cholera victim’s intestines, which in 1849 were preserved in jars in the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia. Their unpublished results match that strain with those that caused pandemics from 1899 to 1923; all these strains differ from the El Tor strain that swept Haiti last year. If Poinar gets cholera DNA from Pozzeveri, it will let him compare the Philadelphia V. cholerae genome with one from the same time but a different place.

After extracting DNA from many of the 40 teeth he gathered at the site, Poinar sent samples to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. There, the DNA is being scanned with a new microarray that can detect DNA from 3000 different pathogens, including the microbes that cause plague, TB, malaria, syphilis, Lyme disease, and cholera.

Despite the unexpected bonus of a probable cholera epidemic, Poinar was still intent on finding plague victims. On his last day at the site, he kept going back to the medieval trench, where the teeth peeped tantalizingly from the wall. Vercellotti gently brushed dirt off the jaw and sprayed it with water, hoping to loosen the sediment. But the jaw wouldn’t budge. He finally gave up. “Next year,” he promised. Poinar left Italy still haunted by hopes of a plague sample.

Two weeks later, when he returned to his lab in Canada, he got a tiny package from Vercellotti. It held the tooth he had wanted so badly. Vercellotti had managed to excavate it in the season’s final week, and its DNA is now being analyzed.","Thu, 12 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/1MainBanner.jpg?itok=26PX6xpb,"['poinar', 'vercellotti', 'plague', 'team', 'bones', 'dna', 'graveyard', 'pozzeveri', 'thousandyear', 'teeth', 'fornaciari', 'ancient']",

89,89,FL-2013-000155-IDN,Now Open: Mysterious Stone Spheres Museum in Costa Rica - The Costa Rica Star,https://news.co.cr/now-open-mysterious-stone-spheres-museum-in-costa-rica/30125/,"They are magnificent, geometrically acute and mystifying. They are the stone spheres of Costa Rica, majestic objects patiently created by the indigenous ancestors to the boruca people who call the Osa region their home, precisely the districts of Cortes, Palmar and Sierpe in the province of Puntarenas. Just a few days ago, the Ministry of Culture in Costa Rica announced that Costa Rica’s beloved stone spheres now have their very own museum.

The Museum of the Stone Spheres is the first in situ (onsite) archeological museum of Costa Rica. On December 7th, the museum opened its doors to the public and has been very busy thus far. This museum, which also doubles as a learning center, is a welcome improvement that will help Finca 6, the most significant pre-Columbian stone sphere park in the world, become a World Heritage Site recognized by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

Until recently, visitors looking for the glorious spheres were met by an open field measuring nearly 10 hectares and a number of signs giving them directions to the magical site where the stone giants are arranged in such a way that they are aligned with the zenithal path of the Sun over the Earth (meaning the passage of sunlight over the surface of our planet).

Since December 7th, visitors have been enjoying a welcome center that is filled with information about one of Costa Rica’s most special places. The new museum has been constructed following ancient architectural designs in the region; it is elevated on concrete pillars to avoid damage by flooding during the torrential green season.

Within 300 meters of museum space, visitors will find restrooms, a special exhibit space and plenty of knowledge about the stone spheres. The current exhibit, which is expected to remain long-term, focuses on the lifestyles of ancient people of Costa Rica who lived in the Diquis Delta as early as the year 800. Many objects such as sculptures, pottery and tools are also on display.

The Mystery Remains

Over the years, extensive research has been made on the origin and purpose of the stone spheres. It is clear that descendants from the Maya people who came south from the upper regions of Mesoamerica shaped the spheres. There is evidence of astronomical intent, but it is not conclusive.

As previously reported by the Costa Rica Star, the alignment of the stone spheres is certainly aesthetic and may have served as an agricultural calendar, but there is also the suggestion that:

[…] the spheres are thus aligned to calculate the zenithal projection of the Sun. […] our ancient astronomers [may have wanted] to [find] the point above an observer that is directly opposite the nadir on an imaginary sphere against which celestial bodies appear to be projected. This would mean that pre-Columbian ancestors in Costa Rica may have had a certain degree of knowledge about the spherical shapes of celestial bodies and their orbits. The zenithal path of the Sun is equivalent to a solstice, something that those who aligned the stone spheres either knew about or suspected. To follow this idea, researchers [must] calculate the zenithal events of the Sun going back 1,500 years -taking into account any adjustments of the Earth axis.

If the above calculations do not sound complicated enough, consider the following: Corroboration of this mathematical hypothesis would also entail performing calculations on other sites in Costa Rica where stone sphere alignments have been observed.

CARONI, Trinidad, Dec 22 2013 (IPS) - Ramdeo Boondoo, a root crop farmer in Caroni, Trinidad, understands better than most the challenge of developing crops that are both climate resilient and marketable.

“It is the eye that buys, not the money,” Boondoo said. Crops must be able to resist effects of climate change while looking and tasting as good as their traditional counterparts. But such produce requires decades of experimentation, which researchers in the Trinidad are beginning to undertake.

“It is very rare that you will get [a genetically altered] crop that is as good as any of the parents” from which the new variety is made, said Herman Adams, a consultant at the Trinidad-based Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI).

Popular varieties of crops were developed over the centuries by people cutting slips of old varieties that they enjoyed and then growing them as clones in a process known as vegetative reproduction, according to Adams.

""It takes over 20 years of selection and cross-pollinating to get the right qualities.""

-- Herman Adams



Developing climate-resilient crops, however, requires sexual reproduction – combining one climate-resilient crop with another variety, which has a preferable taste or shape, to produce a new variety.

“It takes over 20 years of selection and cross-pollinating to get the right organoleptic qualities, including taste, which is hard to recapture,” Adams said. Organoleptic qualities are those affecting the senses.

He explained that sexual reproduction disrupts the parental genetic combination that gives the traditional varieties their appealing taste.

Boondoo has been working on developing a sweet potato that combines the climate-resilient qualities of the traditional “chicken foot” variety popular in Trinidad with the uniform shape of the American Centennial sweet potato.

The chicken foot sweet potato is the most resilient, according to Boondoo. “It withstands drought and damp conditions,” he said. “But…they do not carry a uniform shape or size.”

Manufacturers of agro-products, such as chips and flour made of cassava or plantain, want crops that are not just uniform in taste but also in shape, to make mechanical processing easier. The American Centennial variety has a uniform shape but does not appeal to locals who are accustomed to sweet potatoes with a firmer consistency.

If Boondoo can develop a sweet potato with the traits of both the chicken foot and the American Centennial, he will be better able to supply food processors while also giving local consumers more variety, and his crop losses due to floods or droughts would be greatly reduced.

Chairperson of the Tobago Agro Processors Association, Darilyn Smart, also emphasised that “uniformity is key for the export, hotel and restaurant sectors.”

“In order to export to the EU, produce must meet requirements in terms of size, shape, degree of ripeness, and so on,” Smart told IPS. “For the hotels and restaurants it is also important that we provide consistent products, especially if they are being used on the buffet table.”

Producing new varieties of crops that meet these exacting standards is “a long process”, according to Adams. It involves cross-pollination of the plant, first on a small scale, and then, depending on the initial outcome, large-scale field trials are conducted.

Another objective of these trials is also to produce “high-yielding, competitively priced products,” Boondoo said.

CARDI is working with farmers on these field trials to identify climate-resilient varieties that will also fare well on the market. The institute’s assistance includes training in good agricultural practices, said Dr. Janet Lawrence, an entomologist and programme leader for protected agriculture at CARDI.

“When you create a good environment through [good agricultural practices], then varieties can show their true genetic potential,” Adams explained. Those varieties that show the greatest promise are then used for the field trials.

Smart told the IPS that the Tobago Agro Processors Association will soon be introducing its own pilot project to “ensure crops are uniform, consistent, and disease free, as much as possible.” The project will rely on bio and organic farming methods.

Some of the produce from this project will be used by agro-processors, who will manufacture a value-added product for hotels and supermarkets. “We’re seeking to export the other products to the Caribbean and European countries,” she said.

CARDI also manages a germplasm bank where farmers can obtain material for new varieties of produce with greater yields than popular varieties that are planted, Lawrence said. The germplasm bank has over 14 varieties of cassava and 12 of sweet potato.

As well as breeding climate-resilient varieties, CARDI is promoting the use of protected agriculture – altering the environment to enhance growth – to protect crops from extreme or adverse weather conditions and to control pests that are associated with climate variability and change.

Protected agriculture “spans a continuum from the use of row covers, shade structures to complex structures/greenhouses,” Lawrence said in an e-mail.

Through its protected agriculture research and development programme, CARDI “has sought to generate, validate and transfer ‘best’ practices that have the potential to improve the efficiency and productivity of the [protected agriculture] operations,” Lawrence told IPS.

Studies in protected agriculture include evaluations of heat tolerant varieties, coverings to reduce temperatures within protected systems, and management strategies to suppress pests. Developing shade structures to exclude insect pests are also included.

CARDI has worked with several local, regional and agricultural organisations to disseminate information on the basic principles and practices of protected agriculture, Lawrence said. So far the institute has trained over 200 individuals and organisations.","Sun, 22 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",http://www.ipsnews.net/Library/2013/12/RBoondoo2.jpg,"['lawrence', 'varieties', 'produce', 'climateresistant', 'uniform', 'caribbeans', 'shape', 'test', 'crops', 'agriculture', 'protected', 'taste', 'sweet', 'variety', 'stymies']", 
93,93,FL-2013-000155-IDN,Necessary Reforms Can Keep Interpol Working in the U.S. Interest - Heritage.org,https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/report/necessary-reforms-can-keep-interpol-working-the-us-interest,"On April 23, 2012, the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) denied an Egyptian request to issue a Red Notice—often incorrectly described as an international arrest warrant—for 15 personnel from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that receive U.S. funding, whom the Egyptian government accused of illegally operating pro-democracy programs.[1] Several months later, the issue arose again when Egypt announced that it would seek Interpol’s cooperation in securing the arrest and extradition of seven individuals associated with the production of a controversial Internet video.[2] Again, Interpol refused to act, noting that its constitution prohibited it from becoming involved in religious controversies.[3]

These incidents illustrate the substantial strengths and potential weaknesses of Interpol. Among Interpol’s strengths is its awareness that it must respect its constitution as it facilitates international cooperation against crime and that redefining political or religious disputes as criminal would violate its constitution and destroy the organization.

But Interpol’s potential weaknesses are serious: Like most international organizations, Interpol requires neither democracy nor respect in practice for the rule of law as a condition of membership. Interpol’s high name recognition and global reach encourage its autocratic member nations to exploit that recognition and reach and to use them as instruments of repression. In an era when many nations are seeking to criminalize speech and accusations of financial crimes have become a favorite weapon of autocracies against political opponents, Interpol faces the difficult challenge of remaining true to its constitution.

U.S. participation in Interpol serves U.S. national interests. It should continue and even be enhanced. However, Interpol is not without problems, and it is in the interest of both the U.S. and Interpol to address these faults before they lead to the persecution of innocent people and thereby damage Interpol’s reputation in and usefulness to the United States and other law-abiding democracies.

More broadly, Interpol offers an example of a dilemma that the U.S. confronts regularly. Some international organizations or initiatives are so useless and dangerous that the U.S. should withdraw from them.[4] Yet many international organizations, although flawed by the inclusion of autocratic regimes, nevertheless benefit the United States. This is the case with Interpol.

With these organizations, the best long-term solution for the U.S. is to seek to exclude the autocrats or to establish new organizations that require democracy, or at least respect for the rule of law, as a condition of membership. In the short term, the U.S. must decide how to work within the existing organization in ways that protect U.S. interests and advance American values. In this broader context, Interpol is a case study in the problems inherent for the U.S., as a sovereign and law-abiding democracy, in a world in which international organizations have too readily given membership to autocratic regimes.

Interpol’s Vulnerability to Totalitarian Abuse

In 1914, Prince Albert I of Monaco convened a conference in Monte Carlo to discuss international cooperation against crime. The idea was revived after World War I by Johann Schober, the police chief of Vienna, Austria, who in 1923 convinced police agencies from 20 nations to join his new International Criminal Police Commission (ICPC).[5]

From the start, the ICPC emphasized respect for national sovereignty. It was also designed to ignore political differences, include police organizations from nations such as Fascist Italy, and concentrate on international cooperation against such crimes as counterfeiting. Then as now, the ICPC’s mantra was that it was apolitical and concerned only with improving police efficiency.[6]

But efficiency is not an end in itself. It is a means to an end, and that end can be evil. Regrettably, the ICPC’s commitment to efficiency did not protect it from totalitarian abuse. Shortly after the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, Nazi supporters began to infiltrate the ICPC, which was always headed by the chief of the Vienna police.[7] After Germany annexed Austria in March 1938, ICPC President Michael Skubl was thrown in prison and replaced by Otto Steinhausl, a reliable Nazi.[8] Shockingly, this did not stop the U.S. Congress from authorizing U.S. participation in the ICPC in June 1938.[9] The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) did not cut off contact with the ICPC until three days before Pearl Harbor.[10]

After Steinhausl died in June 1940, he was replaced by the notorious Reinhard Heydrich, Chief of the German Security Police, who moved the ICPC headquarters to Berlin.[11] The ICPC files contained information on the religious affiliation and sexual orientation of suspects and convicts that the Nazis used to locate and arrest Jews and homosexuals.[12]

The Nazis found it easy to take over the ICPC precisely because it was apolitical. As scholar Mathieu Deflem notes, the ICPC “machinery … could be used by any police—loyal to whatever political purpose and ideological persuasion—that participated in, or had taken control of, the organization.”[13] The ICPC’s emphasis on apolitical efficiency and failure to require that member police agencies be democratically accountable made it “amenable to be politicized by whoever had control of the organization.”[14]

After World War II, the ICPC was refounded at a conference in Brussels.[15] By 1950, it had 20 full-time employees supplied by the French Interior Ministry.[16] Productivity was low. According to its annual report in 1950, the ICPC in the previous year had circulated 207 notices, indexed the names of 92 international criminals, reported on 52 drug cases, and circulated descriptions of 26 drug criminals. The result had been a mere 20 arrests and the identification of seven other individuals through the ICPC “fingerprint club.”[17]

The FBI joined the postwar ICPC but proceeded with caution. While the USSR did not participate in the ICPC, several Communist regimes in Eastern Europe—Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Hungary, and Bulgaria—maintained the memberships of their previous non-Communist governments.[18] The FBI ignored all communications that the ICPC transmitted from these dictatorships and discontinued participation in the ICPC radio network.[19]

The FBI was right to be cautious. In March 1950, 10 Czechoslovakian dissidents hijacked a plane and flew to West Germany, where they were granted political asylum.[20] At the request of the Czechoslovak government, the ICPC put out a Red Notice—a formal notification by the Czechoslovak government that the Czechs were criminal fugitives and would be extradited if apprehended—on the dissidents. In response, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover ordered the FBI to withdraw from the ICPC.[21] As a result of the furor, Czechoslovakia and the other Communist regimes dropped out in 1951–1952.[22]

The 1956 Constitution

The loss of the U.S. was a disaster for the ICPC. As a result, the ICPC adopted a new constitution in 1956, which changed the name of the organization to the International Criminal Police Organization—INTERPOL. Article 2 of this constitution requires Interpol to comply with the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and Article 3 forbids it from “undertak[ing] any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character.”[23]

The adoption of the 1956 constitution, particularly Article 3, was and continues to be vital to Interpol. If Interpol had not adopted this constitution, the U.S. would likely not have rejoined as rapidly as it did, and support in the U.S. for Interpol membership would not be strong today. By the same token, the 1956 constitution establishes a baseline against which Interpol should be assessed. It is neither radical, wrong, nor judgmental to expect Interpol to avoid involvement in cases that are political: Interpol’s own constitution obliges it to avoid such cases.

Nor is calling for respect for Article 3 an assault on the sovereignty of Interpol’s member nations. Rather, it is intended to hold this international organization accountable. Interpol was established for clear and limited purposes, and all member nations agreed to respect these purposes when they joined. As Interpol correctly notes, “INTERPOL may refuse to process a request on the basis of Article 3, but States alone have the sovereign right to determine whether an offence is political.”[24] In other words, Interpol cannot make decisions for its member nations about whether to prosecute or extradite because of a supposed offense or prevent those nations from using any other channels at their disposal. It can only govern its own conduct by abiding by the requirements set out in its constitution and subsidiary rules.

For Interpol, governing its conduct is not merely a matter of its need to comply faithfully with its constitution. It is essential to Interpol’s survival and to future U.S. cooperation and support.

Membership, Structure, Databases, and Training Services

Interpol has 190 member nations. It is led by a Secretary General, who acts as its chief executive officer, and an Executive Committee of 13 members, including its President. Interpol is autonomous, and the only significant checks and balances on it are those that it imposes on itself through its General Assembly.[25]

The Interpol General Assembly is like the U.N. General Assembly: Every country has one vote, even though only a few countries, including the U.S., carry most of the financial burden. Regrettably, the balance of power in the Interpol General Assembly, as in the U.N. General Assembly, rests with the Non-Aligned Movement, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the world’s autocracies and dictatorships.[26] Since Interpol has no counterpart to the U.N. Security Council, the Interpol General Assembly is the organization’s final authority.

Interpol’s worst feature is that it includes almost all of the world’s nations and therefore has no meaningful membership standards. Nations that do not pay their dues can be suspended as Cuba, Guinea, Cambodia, and Laos were in the mid-1980s. However, by canceling the unpaid dues owed by member nations in 2001, the Interpol General Assembly made it clear that Interpol was unlikely to apply suspension as a serious threat.[27] Interpol’s constitution also has no provision for the expulsion of a member, although in 1984, paralleling a similar action in the U.N. in 1971, the Interpol General Assembly removed recognition from Taiwan, a member since 1962, and transferred it to the People’s Republic of China.[28]

In 1958, Interpol convinced the U.S. Department of the Treasury—which was then responsible for the U.S. Secret Service and the criminal enforcement of federal laws on alcohol, tobacco, and firearms—to join Interpol, thus re-establishing American participation in the organization.[29] In 1969, as required by Interpol of all member nations since 1956, the U.S. established its National Central Bureau (NCB).[30] The NCB is the primary point of contact between the member nation and Interpol.[31] It is based in the member nation and staffed by employees of its national government.

In the 1980s, the Reagan Administration decided that the U.S. should work more closely with Interpol. This led to the election of John R. Simpson as the first U.S. president of Interpol in 1984, a substantial increase in U.S. contributions to Interpol and spending on the U.S. NCB, U.S. displacement of France as the most influential nation within Interpol, and increased Interpol emphasis on counterterrorism.[32]

Today, the U.S. NCB is a 77-person office (69 of these permanent positions are currently filled) in the DOJ, co-managed with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The NCB also employs 24 contractors and has 53 detailees (some part-time) from 29 federal and local agencies. The NCB also has sub-bureaus in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and in American Samoa.[33]

The U.S. NCB is the largest and best-financed of the NCBs, with a $30 million budget for fiscal year (FY) 2011.[34] Every U.S. state has a liaison office for state and local police to contact Interpol via the NCB.[35] The NCB also works closely with other executive agencies. While it is the primary U.S. point of contact for Interpol, the NCB does not originate U.S. requests to Interpol, which are made by the various U.S. law enforcement agencies that work through it.

During the postwar years, the Secretary General of Interpol was always French until the election of Raymond Kendall of Britain in 1985.[36] Ronald K. Noble, an American, has led Interpol since 2000. Since 1989, Interpol has been headquartered in Lyon, France.

In parallel with growing U.S. support, Interpol’s budget has risen tremendously in the postwar era. In 1948, it totaled less than 100,000 Swiss Francs. By 2011, Interpol’s operating budget exceeded 60 million euros (approximately $86 million).[37] The organization then had a staff of 673, comprised of both permanent employees and national law enforcement officials who are seconded to work at Interpol.[38] The use of seconded employees can result in Interpol benefiting from the expertise of outstanding officers who want to share their knowledge internationally, although Interpol has little control over the quality of those who are seconded to work for it.[39]

Traditionally, all contacts between NCBs (and thus between law enforcement agencies in different nations) took place through Interpol and with the assistance of its staff, but under Secretary General Noble, this hub-and-spoke model has been supplemented by other approaches. One of his most significant projects is I-24/7, Interpol’s global telecommunications network, which was established in 2003. I-24/7 allows an NCB to contact other NCBs and directly query a number of databases maintained by Interpol without routing the query through its staff.[40]

The I-24/7 network has been extended through MIND/FIND, a system that allows local law enforcement officers to query several of these databases without sending their query through their nation’s NCB. As a result, more than 18,000 U.S. law enforcement agencies can access the Interpol “Dashboard.”[41] The MIND/FIND system does not allow access to all databases maintained by Interpol. For example, the database of child sexual exploitation images is available only to select investigators under carefully controlled conditions.[42]

The I-24/7 and MIND/FIND systems have facilitated international police communications. They transmit about 16 million messages annually. As of 2010, only 4 percent of these messages were to or from Interpol headquarters. The rest of the communications were bilateral or multilateral. Thus, the majority of the message traffic on these Interpol systems is not regularly monitored by Interpol. These systems allow member states to communicate law enforcement information to each other in a direct and structured way that is more likely to get a response.

This Interpol service is particularly valuable to local U.S. law enforcement agencies and especially to poorer Interpol member nations because it is sometimes their only form of communication with law enforcement agencies in other nations. Not all communication is between nations: Databases maintained by Interpol are also available—after approval by its Executive Committee and subject to any restrictions imposed on national data by the nations that provided it—to selected international organizations.[43]

Interpol does not collect or own the information in the databases it maintains. These databases contain information submitted by NCBs. This information is national property, and Interpol will delete it on request from the NCB that submitted it. The submitting NCB can also delete it directly via Interpol’s I-Link system, an online system that works without intervention by Interpol’s staff.

Interpol maintains databases on a number of subjects, including maritime piracy, stolen works of art, stolen motor vehicles, and child sexual exploitation images, the last of which as of 2011 had helped to rescue 2,511 victims.[44] The oldest and most important database maintained by Interpol is the Nominal Database, which contains the names of and other information about 162,525 criminals and suspected criminals.[45] As of 2010, approximately 59,000 of these individuals were fugitives.[46] Thanks to MIND/FIND, local law enforcement agencies can search the Nominal Database directly without going through their NCBs.[47] Increased access has led to more hits, with database matches rising from 49,902 in 2005 to 202,807 in 2011.[48]

Interpol’s fingerprint database has prints for 171,000 individuals.[49] Of these, as of 2010, 4,300 came from the U.S.[50] This is only a small fraction of the 70 million criminal fingerprints in the FBI’s Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System, which indicates that the U.S. has exercised good judgment in providing Interpol with fingerprints only when necessary.[51] The fingerprint database yields about five hits per day, for a total of 1,817 hits in 2011.[52] Interpol urges countries to submit fingerprints for non-citizens arrested for serious crimes, even if they are not subsequently convicted. This raises potential privacy issues.[53] The U.S. does not allow Cuba, the International Criminal Court (ICC), Iran, Sudan, or Syria to access fingerprints it has provided to the database maintained by Interpol.[54]

Interpol began to create a DNA database in 2002.[]By 2011, it had accumulated DNA profiles for 116,695 people.[55] As of 2009, this database had DNA information on 4,300 individuals from the U.S.[56] As with all databases maintained by Interpol, a nation submitting DNA information can limit access to particular countries or for specified purposes.[57] In 2011, 51 positive DNA matches were made, a marked increase from the single match in 2003.[58] The DNA database contains no names and no information about cases. Each entry in the database is a code that links back to the providing NCB. If there is a match on the DNA database, the providing NCB can choose whether to reveal further information about the entry that produced the hit to the NCB that searched the database.

The Interpol database that includes the most Americans is likely its record of Stolen and Lost Travel Documents (SLTD). As of 2011, this database held records of more than 31 million documents, most of them passports reported as lost or stolen by the owner.[59] If a lost passport is found, the owner can report this to his or her government, which can then remove the passport from the database. For border control officers, Interpol’s MIND/FIND system allows a one-second passport scan against the SLTD database.[60]

In January 2009, the U.S. began using passenger manifests for all international air and sea passengers entering the U.S. to screen the passport numbers of those passengers against the SLTD database. If a passenger is using a lost or stolen passport, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials will know about it before that individual steps off the airplane or ship. In 2012, the U.S. conducted more than 220 million queries of the SLTD database.[61]

Secretary General Noble has asked airlines to provide Interpol with passenger passport numbers for all international flights and hopes to expand SLTD checks to international trains and passenger ships.[62] One of his highest priorities has been to expand the number of nations that provide details on cancelled travel documents and that check passports against the SLTD database. As of 2011, only 44 nations regularly conducted such scans.[63]

In 2011, the SLTD database produced 47,025 hits.[64] Interpol has acknowledged that most of these hits involve passports that the passport holder reported as lost and then later found and used in error.[65] While the detection of people who really are who they claim to be contributes nothing to controlling crime, some hits are significant. For example, when the SLTD database was used in 2007 for the ICC Cricket World Cup, Caribbean host countries conducted nearly 500,000 searches that resulted in 126 database hits, including at least one individual using a stolen passport.[66]

Interpol noted in 2011 that the SLTD database was growing “exponentially,” with 10,000 new records added every day for the preceding five years.[67] While this growth makes it inevitable that regular searches of the SLTD database will produce more false positives, the database plays a useful role in limiting the ability of criminals and terrorists to travel on stolen documents and thereby contributes to U.S. security.

Interpol also maintains a terrorism database, which as of 2013 contains information on 11,000 persons with suspected links to terrorist activities.[68] Interpol takes the names on the list—which can include monikers such as “Muhammad Muhammad”—and attempts to add further identifying information, such as photos or a date of birth.[69] In addition to helping to identify individuals affiliated with al-Qaeda or the Taliban, the additional information reduces the frequency with which innocent individuals with the same name as a suspect are falsely identified as terrorists.

Interpol also assists U.N. peacekeeping missions and supports counterterrorism efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. In one case, Interpol sent several telephone numbers to Belgium and Italy that had been found on a cell phone captured from a terrorist. This information resulted in the destruction of terrorist cells in those nations.[70] As of 2010, the U.S. had supplied information on 1,065 terrorist suspects or affiliates to this database, and it has restricted access to this information to selected nations.[71] Secretary General Noble has described Interpol as “irrelevant” to the fight against terrorism before 9/11, but under his leadership, Interpol has become an increasingly important clearinghouse for international information on terrorism.[72]

Interpol also plays a role in facilitating international cooperation on humanitarian matters, although most cooperation is bilateral and not conducted through Lyon. For example, from December 2012 through June 2013, the U.S. NCB processed 94 death notifications (76 originating in requests from foreign NCBs) and 57 health and welfare inquiries (43 originating in requests from foreign NCBs). It also dealt with 43 suicide inquiries, including 32 from foreign NCBs.[73]

The Internet has made it much easier for individuals on social media in other nations to notice when an American is threatening to commit suicide and to alert their NCB, which then contacts the U.S. NCB, which in turn alerts local U.S. law enforcement agencies to check on the safety of the U.S. individual in question. It may be argued that this sort of activity has little relationship to the fight against crime, but it is clearly part of the work of police authorities around the world. Since Interpol’s primary form of involvement is to allow its member nations to use its I-24/7 network for humanitarian purposes, there is good reason to regard these activities as a largely unpublicized side benefit of Interpol’s existence.

Finally, Interpol holds, operates, and produces a wide variety of conferences, programs, and publications for law enforcement officers at its headquarters, in regional bureaus, and around the world, including training and standards programs on disaster victim identification (guidance for identifying victims of mass casualty events such as a tsunami);[74] a manual of best practices for investigation of computer crime;[75] Global Standards to Combat Corruption in Police Forces and Services; and the Interpol Bioterrorism Prevention Resource Centre.[76] It can also dispatch an Incident Response Team to assist national agencies during a crisis, such as a major terrorist bombing or natural disaster.[77] Finally, Interpol International Major Event Support Teams (IMESTs) provide assistance at major events such as the Olympics.[78] Interpol’s training programs have attracted little attention and, to date, no controversy.

The Interpol Notice System

Contrary to media reports, which frequently credit Interpol with making arrests, it is the law enforcement agencies of Interpol’s member nations that are responsible for arresting individuals.[79] As an international organization of law enforcement agencies, Interpol facilitates international cooperation against crime. It is not a police force.

Interpol does, however, have a system of “wanted” notices. Indeed, its most well-established function is sending out international notices about criminals or crime. According to Interpol, 7,958 individuals were arrested in 2011 based on Interpol notices or diffusions (which are discussed in the next section). Most Interpol notices are Red Notices, which are sometimes inaccurately described as Interpol arrest warrants. In reality, Interpol does not issue arrest warrants. By asking Interpol to publish a Red Notice, an NCB affirms that it has a valid arrest warrant or court order for the named individual and that it will seek the extradition of the individual in question if he or she is apprehended.

Before Interpol publishes a notice, the legal staff of the Interpol Secretariat General (IPSG), in its Office of Legal Affairs, reviews the notice request to ensure that a valid arrest warrant exists. This amounts to ensuring that the requesting nation has checked the appropriate box on the form, as nations are only encouraged, not required, to provide an actual warrant.[80] Unwisely, Interpol makes notice requests visible to all NCBs before this review process is complete, although requests are identified as provisional.[81] An NCB can allow Interpol to make a redacted version of the Red Notice that it requested public, but it is not required to do so.

Interpol’s member nations are also free to decide how to act on a notice. Some member nations treat a Red Notice as an actionable request for an arrest. The U.S. does not.[82] Other Interpol communications, including diffusions and messages, also are not actionable requests in the U.S.

The varying legal statuses of Interpol’s communications around the world and the exigencies of particular cases mean that the U.S. NCB plays an important role in choreographing the timing and type of U.S. requests to Interpol. The arrest in Colombia of four men who were the subject of Interpol Red Notices in connection with the murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent James Watson is a recent case in point.[83]

In 2011, Interpol published 10,747 notices, of which 7,678 were Red Notices.[84] It also published:

705 blue notices (“individuals of interest in relation to a crime”);

1,132 green notices (“warnings and intelligence about serious criminals”);

1,059 yellow notices (missing persons);

104 black notices (unidentified bodies);

31 orange notices (“dangerous materials, criminal acts or events that pose a potential threat to public safety”);

8 purple notices (“objects, devices or concealment methods used by criminals”); and

30 special notices (“individuals associated with Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, as listed by the 1267 Committee of the UN Security Council”).[85]

At the end of 2011, Interpol had 40,836 valid notices in circulation.[86] As shown on Chart 1, the number of notices published annually rose substantially after the launch of the I-Link system in 2009.[87] As recently as 1998, Interpol published only 737 Red Notices per year, compared with 7,678 in 2011.[88]

The U.S. Department of Justice estimated that in FY 2010, Interpol published 1,429 notices of all types and transmitted 431 diffusions at the request of the United States. In the same year, 143 arrests, extraditions, or deportations on an Interpol notice or diffusion had a U.S. nexus.[89]

Currently, Interpol’s understanding of Article 3 is governed by the “predominance” test, which requires only that Interpol avoid cases that are predominantly political, but the proper application of Article 3 has a long and contested history.[90] Interpol properly refused the Castro dictatorship’s request for Red Notices on police officials of the Batista regime, and it has refused to help China investigate the Falun Gong.[91] Less admirably, it also refused to issue Red Notices for the Palestinian terrorists who attacked the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972.[92] This decision reflected the fact that for many years, Interpol shied away from counterterrorism out of concern that it could be considered political, a concern that was accentuated by the blowback from the 1950 Czechoslovakian hijacking.

Then, in 1984, Interpol adopted the principle of the “conflict area.”[93] A terrorist act outside a “conflict area” (for example, an al-Qaeda bombing in London), especially if it targeted civilians or was particularly large, would be considered a crime that Interpol could work to investigate or prevent.[94] Interpol has since become active in counterterrorism with enthusiastic U.S. support.

The application of Article 3, however, is not free from controversy. Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of troubling cases, including:

General Augusto Pinochet (1998). Augusto Pinochet, former dictator of Chile, was arrested in Britain in 1998 because of an Interpol Red Notice issued at the request of a notoriously political Spanish judge. This case is particularly troubling because Spain had no connection to the events in Chile, and Spain’s request rested on a claim of universal jurisdiction—a controversial assertion of the right to prosecute supposed crimes anywhere in the world, regardless of accepted jurisdictional boundaries—which Interpol endorsed by issuing the Red Notice. In discussing this case, former Interpol Secretary General Kendall stated that “if the British had said they didn’t agree, that this action shouldn’t involve Interpol, then I would have never made the decision” to issue the Red Notice.[95] This is a troubling statement both because it implies that Interpol considers the sentiments of the nation in which a supposed fugitive is residing before it issues a Red Notice and because it implies that Interpol is willing to act on a claim of universal jurisdiction unless that nation objects to it. On the other hand, since nations are not required to act on a Red Notice and since it had the opportunity to pre-empt the publication of the notice in question, Britain is also to blame for acceding to this politicized request.

Former Kazakh Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin (1999, 2000, and 2002). In 1999 and 2000, Interpol issued a Red Notice on former Kazakh Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, a presidential challenger who was accused of corruption and embezzlement.[96] This was a controversial action, and Interpol rescinded the Red Notice in 2001 on the grounds that it did not comply with Article 3. In 2002, the Interpol General Assembly made a final decision to issue a new Red Notice by a vote of 46–38, with 23 abstentions. In commenting on this case, Secretary General Noble stated that “Interpol is a democratic organization, and when our members have expressed their will through the democratic process, the general secretariat moves promptly—as in this case—to implement the member states’ decision.”[97]

Ilya Katsnelson is a U.S. citizen residing in Copenhagen, Demark. He is the managing director of VTMS ApS, a Danish ship management company, which worked closely with the Russian firm Volgotanker from 2001 to 2006. In 2008, while driving through Germany to his home, he was detained by German police after a routine document check as the result of an Interpol Red Notice issued at the request of Russia. He was held for almost two months in a maximum security prison in Lübeck, Germany. It soon became apparent that Katsnelson was a victim of the Russian government’s politically motivated assault on Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s YUKOS oil company, which had previously spun off Volgotanker. Because the Russian allegations against Katsnelson were rapidly revised to include the charge of “fraud and money laundering,” they made it difficult for him to use Western banks or travel. Katsnelson continues to protest the ongoing Russian abuse of Interpol in his and other cases.[98]

Shahram Homayoun (2009). Homayoun is an Iranian exile now living in Los Angeles. He owns Channel One TV, a Persian satellite television network that broadcasts into Iran. In 2009, at the request of an Iranian prosecutor, Interpol issued a Red Notice on Homayoun, charging him with terrorism. Senator Jeff Sessions (R–AL) raised concern about the case in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in March 2011.[99] The U.S. has promised not to extradite Homayoun but has noted that it cannot protect him if he travels abroad.[100] Thus, while the Red Notice has not silenced Homayoun or resulted in his extradition, it has limited his freedom of movement. Cases like Homayoun’s led Kyle Parker, a policy adviser to the U.S. Helsinki Commission, to argue that “A Red Notice can be even more effective than the judicial system, with none of the safeguards. It doesn’t prosecute you. It persecutes you.”[101] The Homayoun and Katsnelson cases point out the wide-ranging consequences of abuse of the Interpol system. Even after Interpol rescinds a notice, it can linger on in national systems around the world, meaning that it is nearly impossible to fully protect an individual from the consequences of such abuse.

Benny Wenda (2011). In 2011, at Indonesia’s request, Interpol published a Red Notice on Benny Wenda, a West Papuan political activist who had been granted asylum in Britain. After an intervention by the British NGO Fair Trials International in 2010 and after the case was raised in the House of Commons in late 2011, Interpol rescinded the notice in 2012 and deleted the relevant information from the databases it maintains when it decided that the notice was not “in compliance with Interpol’s rules and regulations.”[102]

In 2012, Interpol published a Red Notice on behalf of Iraq on Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi, a Sunni who fled Baghdad in 2011 and had allegedly planned bomb attacks on and assassinations of Shi’ite politicians.[103] Analyst Max Boot notes that, while “it is quite possible that Hashemi is guilty of the killings attributed to him ... [T]he fact that the [Iraqi] courts … [are] not in any credible way independent” has created the widespread perception that the case against Hashemi is a “political vendetta.”[104]

Kross is an Estonian politician. He is a supporter of Estonia’s NATO membership, and as a director of Estonia’s intelligence service, he helped Georgia combat Russian cyber-attacks during the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. On August 8, 2012 the fourth anniversary of the start of the War, Russia asked Interpol to issue a Red Notice on Kross. Russia claimed Kross had masterminded the hijacking of a Russian ship in 2009, a claim that Kross forthrightly described as “idiotic.”[105] On June 21, 2013, almost a year later, Interpol refused the request, stating that complying with it would be a “violation of the organization’s constitution and rules.”[106] Kross appeared to have won a significant victory. But on October 18, 2013, twenty-four hours before local elections in Estonia, when Kross’s IRL Party appeared poised to make sizable gains from the Russian-aligned Center Party, Interpol suddenly published a Red Notice on Kross. Marko Mihkelson, a leading member of IRL, noted that he could not “remember an election with this much Russian interference,” and Kross himself stated that the “most recent official position from Interpol is that [Russia’s action] has an unequivocally politically motivated intention. The only difference since the first Russian action taken against me is that I am threatening a Russian partner party’s position of power in the Tallinn elections.”[107] Estonia’s interior minister, Ken-Marti Vaher, described the Red Notice as “clearly politically motivated.”[108] Interpol’s decision in this case is extremely difficult to defend, and is particularly troubling because it was announced almost simultaneously with its decision on the case of Petr Silaev, described below. It thus appears to be part of a concerted move by Interpol to placate Russia in the aftermath of its well-publicized decision in the case of William Browder, also described below.

On one hand, given the number of Red Notices and other kinds of notices that Interpol publishes, the number of troubling cases is low. In complaints about Interpol, the same cases tend to be mentioned regularly. Of course, this is no reason to dismiss concerns relevant to those cases, but it does suggest that there may not be many more troubling cases waiting to be revealed.

This is certainly Interpol’s contention. The five-member Commission for the Control of Interpol’s Files (CCF), which monitors the application of Interpol’s data protection rules, noted in its 2010 annual report that in that year, it received only 201 requests from individuals named in Interpol’s files and only 123 complaints, including 15 from the U.S. Of the requests, only 32 gave rise to concerns relevant to Article 3. Of the 170 requests processed by the CCF in 2010, only 46 percent—approximately 78 requests—resulted in any alteration in Interpol’s files or website.[109] Interpol has estimated that only about 3 percent of cases are referred to the IPSG legal staff in the Office of Legal Affairs for a full review.[110]

On the other hand, the cost and complexity of obtaining legal representation with sufficient expertise to challenge an Interpol notice effectively may prevent additional troubling cases from coming to light. Interpol’s procedures for reviewing notice requests that may raise Article 3 concerns are also unclear.

In 2010, the Law Library of Congress published a report on Red Notices that summarized their publication process and legal status in various jurisdictions. The Law Library noted that “it seems in general that Interpol must depend on its member countries for a Red Notice request being legitimate,” although “certain mechanisms” exist to assess the legitimacy of a request. The Law Library did not explain what these mechanisms are. It concluded only that assessing whether a request would violate Article 3 “appears to be an internal [Interpol] process.”[111] While Interpol’s reliance on internal processes is neither surprising nor wrong, the opacity of these processes does not build confidence in Interpol’s assertion that the number of troubling cases is only a tiny fraction of the overall total.

Furthermore, Interpol itself clearly has qualms about the rising number of politically motivated requests for Red Notices it is receiving. In 2010, the Interpol General Assembly adopted a resolution noting that it was “concerned about the increase in the number of requests … concerning genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, which raise doubts as to their compliance with Article 3 of the Constitution.” In response, Interpol decided to accept such requests only from international tribunals and entities established by the U.N. Security Council. If a member nation makes such a request concerning a national of another member country, the other member nation has 30 days to protest the request before the notice is issued.[112]

This was a reasonable step, but it concerned only requests related to the most serious offenses. It leaves open the obvious risk that there might be more numerous politically motivated requests involving less serious supposed offenses.

Even apart from the opacity of its internal processes, the sheer number of notices that Interpol now publishes makes it difficult for anyone to assess whether Interpol is abiding fully by the letter and spirit of Article 3. A 2011 study by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists found that more than 2,200 of the 7,622 Red Notices that it examined were published as a result of requests from nations that did not respect human rights and that nearly half were from countries that Transparency International ranks as among the most corrupt in the world.[113] In short, the fact that critics tend to raise the same cases regularly may indicate only that most Red Notices are not publicly summarized and that, in any case, the number of notices Interpol does publish is too large to assess.

Interpol is well aware of the need to abide by its constitution. As Joël Sollier, General Counsel of Interpol, concisely put it in 2011, “If we don’t, we are dead.” But Sollier also noted that “[it’s] really tricky…. You receive [a request for a notice] from a country where human rights are not respected…. I would love to have only requests from Switzerland,” but “[t]he world is not like that.…”[114] Indeed, Interpol mirrors the world: Both contain many nations that do not respect human rights.

As Sollier implies, the problem is not enunciating the need to respect the rule of law or to uphold Interpol’s constitution, but deciding how to apply these needs when Interpol has many autocratic member nations. Billy Hawkes, the Irish chairman of the CCF, has implied that it is difficult to separate political and criminal activity because “One man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter.”[115] This is a dangerous sentiment, and any hint of sympathy with it from anyone connected with Interpol is troubling because it implies a lack of commitment to the counterterrorism efforts in which Interpol has increasingly engaged and, fundamentally, to Interpol’s constitution.

Yet the underlying problem is not that Interpol systemically disregards Article 3. The underlying problem is that Interpol operates on the basis of the sovereign equality of all of its members, and thus on the assumption that all of their notice requests should be presumed to have equal validity. As Interpol Senior Counsel Yaron Gottlieb said:

We assume that what we receive here is accurate and relevant, that an arrest warrant is issued by a judge that is not corrupt, and, of course, that the case is not political. But then, if we receive information or if we have our own information that in fact, the case is different from what it seems to be, we engage in a full review.[116]

This assumption would make sense if all of Interpol’s member nations met a minimum standard of respect for the rule of law, but too few members of most international organizations, including too few members of Interpol, in fact meet this minimum standard. The underlying problem is thus that, while Interpol is a democratic organization committed to promoting the rule of law, a majority of its members are autocracies that are not fully committed to the rule of law.

To its credit, Interpol is more aware than many other international organizations of the existence of this problem. Interpol’s efforts to ameliorate it are regular and apparently sincere, but the problem persists and will persist as long as Interpol is rightly based on the sovereign equality of its member nations and wrongly has undemanding standards for continued membership.

Interpol’s very success in building a modern communications system has made this underlying problem more serious. When Interpol was issuing hundreds of notices a year on paper, as it was in the 1990s, and all NCBs worked through Lyon, Interpol’s very inefficiency offered some protection against autocratic abuse.

Today, Interpol is still based on the presumption that all of its member nations are equally law-abiding, but its modern system has vastly expanded both the number of notices and diffusions that are published and transmitted and the speed with which this is done. In 2011, for example, assuming it worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Interpol issued an average of 21 Red Notices every day—almost one every hour.

Interpol has acknowledged that approximately 97 percent of notice requests are not reviewed in depth. Such a review appears to be undertaken only if a request is particularly controversial or becomes so after the relevant notice is issued. The efficiency of the system has made it easier to abuse, while the volume of traffic makes abuse harder to detect. Interpol seems not to have anticipated that creating an efficient and modern communications system posed risks in addition to offering real benefits.

Even apart from the problem inherent in its autocratic membership, there is an obvious danger that Interpol will libel or harass an innocent individual by publishing a Red Notice that incorrectly describes that individual as a wanted criminal. If an individual believes that a notice or diffusion is politicized or otherwise in error, he can take up the issue with the CCF. If the CCF rejects the complaint, Interpol will consider redress only if an NCB formally files a protest. At that point, the IPSG and then the Secretary General review the case.[117] If the dispute is not resolved through this process, the protesting NCB can ultimately refer the matter to the General Assembly.

One disadvantage of this redress system is that the General Assembly makes the final decision, and as the Kazhegeldin case illustrated, that decision may be controversial. A less obvious flaw in the system is that the CCF is also an imperfect instrument. Because Interpol member nations choose the CCF members, there is no guarantee that they will come from democratic and law-abiding nations. Currently, the CCF members come from Ireland, France, Canada, Mauritius, and Jordan, with all but Jordan being widely recognized as law-abiding democracies.[118]

Until Interpol’s rules are changed to make it impossible for autocracies to be represented on the CCF, the U.S. should work closely with other democracies inside Interpol to ensure that CCF appointees come exclusively from democratic nations and that there is always a U.S. citizen on the CCF. Moreover, under the current system, the CCF can take more than a year to conclude its investigations. The U.S. should seek to speed up the operation of the CCF and to create a procedure for expedited CCF review, if necessary by providing the CCF with additional resources in Interpol and by requiring NCBs to respond to CCF inquiries within a reasonable time period.

The Diffusion System

Interpol’s diffusions are less well-known than its notices, but they are just as if not more troubling. (For a summary of the differences between notices, diffusions, and messages, see Table 1.) Unlike notices, diffusions are not systematically reviewed in any way by the IPSG legal staff before publication or even published by Interpol.[119] Instead, they are automatically recorded in Interpol’s database and distributed on its I-Link network after transmission by an NCB. In 2011, Interpol was responsible for the distribution of 15,640 diffusions.

One difference between diffusions and notices is that diffusions can be sent to nations of the sending NCB’s choosing: Diffusions, unlike notices, are not sent automatically to all Interpol member nations.[120] This is useful because it allows the U.S., for example, to request assistance in pursuing a terrorist suspect without alerting nations such as Iran that may be working in league with the suspect.

On the other hand, the utility of this aspect of the diffusion system should not be exaggerated. Nations have many ways of communicating with each other, and the diffusion system is merely one such channel. Moreover, since the U.S. can use Interpol’s I-24/7 system to send messages directly and privately with nations of its choosing, the limits that can be placed on the circulation of diffusions are not unique inside the Interpol system. It is therefore difficult to regard this aspect of the diffusion system as particularly significant or valuable.

While diffusions are required to respect Article 3 of the Interpol constitution and other applicable rules, in practice, no safeguards prevent autocracies from transmitting diffusions on political opponents, racial or religious minorities, or individuals for whom there is no valid arrest warrant. This was illustrated in April 2012 when Interpol transmitted a diffusion from Egypt requesting the arrest of the 15 NGO workers even though Interpol had refused to publish a Red Notice on the same individuals.[121] One scholar has therefore concluded that diffusions “are not in conformity with basic requirements for criminal or administrative procedures affecting individual rights.”[122]

Interpol encourages member nations to transmit a diffusion when “its request does not justify or does not qualify for the publication of a notice.” It notes that “all international alerts,” both Red Notices and diffusions, can be submitted “in a matter of seconds” with “the information recorded instantly into the Organization’s central database and immediately accessible to police around the world.”[123] In short, it is easy—and even encouraged—to request a Red Notice from Interpol and simultaneously to transmit a diffusion directly to all law enforcement agencies around the world that participate in Interpol. This system of Interpol notices and diffusions practically invites nations which anticipate that a requested notice will not be granted to back up their request through the diffusion system.

In spite of the lack of safeguards in the diffusion system, there appear to be fewer controversial diffusions than Red Notices. The reasons for this are unclear. One may be that the press tends to describe everything published by Interpol as a Red Notice—or in even less exact terminology—so it is not easy to know when the legal instrument in question was actually a diffusion. Another may be that diffusions simply attract less attention than Red Notices, which can be described in catchy if inaccurate terms as international arrest warrants. A third may be, paradoxically, that as Interpol has begun to improve its procedures for issuing and retracting Red Notices, particularly through its 2012 Rules on the Processing of Data and the CCF, which was formally integrated into Interpol in 2008, autocracies have started to resort to diffusions to achieve their ends.

Some circumstantial evidence suggests that this is occurring: A number of the most controversial cases in recent years have apparently centered on diffusions, including the Egyptian one noted above and the two described below. If this is so, these controversial cases are signs that Interpol’s reforms in the Red Notice system are having a positive effect. Of course, this does not mean that problems in the diffusion system should be ignored.

Petr Silaev (2010). Silaev, a Russian environmental and political activist, fled Russia after he was accused of “hooliganism” for participating in a demonstration against a new highway in Moscow in July 2010. Finland recognized him as a political refugee, but he was arrested and detained in Spain on the strength of a request by Russia through Interpol’s channels. Spain eventually refused to extradite Silaev and recognized that Russia’s request was political. Fair Trials International intervened with Interpol through the CCF on Silaev’s behalf, but in late October 2013, the CCF rejected this intervention, stating that “there is no reason to believe that the retention of information [relating to Silaev] in INTERPOL’s files would not be in compliance with INTERPOL’s rules.”[124] It is difficult to believe that the CCF’s decision in this case is compatible with Joël Sollier’s statement that “his personal instruction is to simply cancel a Red Notice when there’s a doubt.”[125] Nor is Interpol’s failure to recognize that charges of “hooliganism” are often political limited to the Silaev case. In a nearly simultaneous decision, Interpol announced that it will send an IMEST to protect the 2014 Ice Hockey World Championship, to be held in the dictatorship of Belarus, from “hooliganism.” Like Russia, Belarus has a record of using charges of “hooliganism” for political purposes.[126]

William Browder (2013). Interpol’s action in this case was correct, but it still sheds light on the efforts of some member nations to use Interpol for political purposes. On April 17, 2013, Russia used Interpol in a farcical effort to “locate” William Browder, the co-founder of Hermitage Capital.[127] Browder, who is not in hiding, has played a leading role in exposing Russian corruption and fighting for justice in the death of his former lawyer, the late Sergei Magnitsky.[128] Interpol has recently issued Red Notices for other individuals sought by Russian authorities, often on grounds that are seemingly political.[129] Because of Browder’s prominence, the Russian request attracted considerable public comment and prompted a defensive response by Secretary General Noble, which in turn drew a reply from Jago Russell, Chief Executive of Fair Trials International.[130] Browder challenged the Russian action through Interpol. Before Interpol announced its decision, the German Justice Ministry preemptively rejected the Russian request and stated that “it will not grant in future this request or similar Interpol red notices, Interpol blue notices or diffusions of the Russian Federation.”[131] On May 24, Interpol “deleted all information” related to Browder from its files after the CCF determined that the case was of “a predominantly political nature.”[132 ] The day after this decision, Russia announced that it would continue to seek Browder’s arrest through Interpol. A Hermitage Capital representative pointedly argued that “[i]f Russian authorities continue in their non-compliance with Interpol’s constitution and abuse Interpol’s systems for the purpose of political persecution, their access to Interpol databases must be suspended under the Interpol rules.”[133] On July 26, Interpol received a Russian request for a Red Notice against Browder, which it immediately rejected.[134] While the outcome to date in the Browder case is a good one and to Interpol’s credit, Browder has substantial resources, is well-known, and is leading a campaign that has won justified applause from many democratic governments and Western NGOs. A less prominent and well-represented individual would be fortunate to have this backing, which may well have encouraged Interpol to arrive speedily at the correct decision in the Browder case. Moreover, Interpol’s decisions in the cases of Kross and Silaev have the appearance of being intended to compensate Russia for Interpol’s refusal to cooperate with Russia’s attempts to persecute Browder.

Interpol argues that it does not endorse diffusions, but rather is simply distributing the words of an NCB. In briefings, Interpol has analogized itself to a newspaper, which might publish an accurate report that someone has been indicted even if the indictment is later found to have been based on a false affidavit.[135] Yet by allowing its systems to be used to transmit diffusions, Interpol is complicit in this transmission, and, of course, Interpol is not a newspaper: It is an organization of law enforcement agencies. Moreover, even if the First Amendment would shield a newspaper in such a case from civil liability, responsible newspapers do not publish grave accusations against individuals without checking the facts.

Finally, Interpol itself takes credit in its annual reports for arrests made on the basis of diffusions.[136] This is the best evidence that diffusions do carry Interpol’s stamp of approval, are viewed by Interpol as a tool equivalent in effect to a notice, and are acted upon as such by many Interpol member nations. This would be less problematic if diffusions were subject to the same protections as the notice system. As they are not, diffusions have the endorsement inherent in notices but without equivalent safeguards.

It is true that diffusions do serve one important purpose. Occasionally, an urgent situation—such as a fugitive seeking to flee from one nation to another—does not give the notice system time to work. The diffusion system, by contrast, is virtually instantaneous. But at the request of an NCB, Interpol can clear an appropriate a notice request in advance. Even without advance clearance, Interpol now publishes Red Notices resulting from U.S. requests in two to three hours.[137] In short, while emergencies do occur, the notice system normally works fast enough to meet the needs of all but the most exceptional cases.

Given their practical equivalence to notices, there is no reason why diffusions should not—like notices—be subject to systematic IPSG review. Regrettably, this is not Interpol’s practice. Instead, a diffusion is transmitted directly to other NCBs, normally without any IPSG review. Interpol keeps the diffusion active for five years, after which it asks the issuing NCB whether it has new information. Even if there is no new information, the NCB can keep the diffusion active indefinitely.[138] The same five-year procedure applies to Red Notices, but Red Notices are subject to the more formal IPSG review process. Thus, in practice, a nation can use the diffusion system to evade the protections that, albeit imperfectly, exist in the Red Notice system.

As Chart 1 shows, while statistics for every year are not available, the number of diffusions transmitted has risen in parallel with the increasing number of Red Notices published. There is reason to believe that this is in part a result of NCBs simultaneously requesting a Red Notice and transmitting a diffusion on the same case.

The Problem of Information Security

Interpol holds a large and growing collection of data about wanted and convicted criminals around the world, including individuals wanted on charges of terrorism. Authoritarian regimes can use the Interpol system to harass innocent individuals or political opponents, but the system could also be of use to authoritarian regimes and supporters of terrorism in other ways.

For example, if an agent working for the Iranian regime perpetrated a terrorist attack in Iraq, the Iranian state might want to know whether the agent left behind any evidence of his identity. The Iranian NCB could query the Interpol database to compare the terrorist’s fingerprints with those held by Interpol. If the query did not produce a hit, Interpol would have been used in effect to vet the agent, who could now be safely employed again in future terrorist attacks. A regime might also seek to poison the Interpol system by flooding it with large amounts of irrelevant or incorrect data, or to infiltrate an agent into Interpol headquarters to frustrate the identification of particular individuals or to alert them that they are being sought or have been identified. In short, the number of ways that authoritarian regimes, perhaps in alliance with terrorist organizations, could use Interpol’s data and systems for mischief is substantial.

It is true that data coming into and out of Interpol are not easily identified by anyone other than the submitting NCB. Thus, for example, an intelligence agent in Interpol’s headquarters would not automatically know that a particular fingerprint search was related to a terrorist he was seeking to protect. But it would be unwise to assume that, just because such an abuse of the Interpol system would be technically challenging, it would therefore not be attempted.

Interpol points out that a nation can hide its data from any other nation unless the data relate to a notice requested by the first nation.[139] For example, the U.S. does not allow Iran, Syria, Sudan, or the International Criminal Court to access any data supplied by the U.S., except data related to a U.S. notice request. This is a wise precaution, but a foreign agent in Interpol or an agent working for a third country could seek to circumvent that precaution. For example, an Iranian spy in the Iraqi NCB could query U.S. data on behalf of his handlers. Interpol simply has no way of knowing whether officials in NCBs are corrupt or collaborating with terrorists.

Concern about intelligence penetration of Interpol is not new. In a 1975 Senate hearing, then-Secretary General Jean Nepote blandly asserted, “We have never encountered this problem, and we have never had any reason whatsoever to suspect any employee of being an intelligence agent.” He further noted that employees were required to sign an agreement promising to maintain professional secrecy.[140] This response was absurd, as it implied that Nepote believed—or claimed to believe—that an intelligence agent would never violate a signed confidentiality agreement. In light of Nepote’s willful blindness, it was hardly surprising that Interpol had “never encountered” a problem of intelligence penetration.

By 1990, the London Metropolitan Police were not so optimistic. They stated that “Interpol staff are not experienced in affording the proper protection to classified material, do not possess the requisite security clearances, and [their] politics and motives are, to say the least, questionable in this context.”[141] A decade later, in 2001, a Foreign Policy interviewer stated to outgoing Secretary General Raymond Kendall that “a former senior U.S. Intelligence official told me with certainty that Interpol had been compromised.” Kendall responded that “Interpol is secure” and acknowledged only occasional instances of corruption, but he also admitted that, as “a fact of international political life,” he was reluctant to share money-laundering information with Russian authorities because of concern that it might end up in the wrong hands.[142]

In recent years, Interpol has shown greater awareness of the problems associated with data protection. In 2009, for example, its General Assembly passed a resolution calling for the “enhancement of measures to protect Interpol’s reputation and the integrity of its police information system.” This resolution alluded to unspecified events at an NCB that evidently constituted a “serious incident.”[143]

By formalizing the CCF’s role and producing its Rules on the Processing of Data in 2012, Interpol has again demonstrated that it is one of the world’s more responsible international organizations. Yet in the end, given that the purpose of Interpol is to facilitate international cooperation on law enforcement, it is not possible to design a system that is completely immune from the risks associated with intelligence penetration, especially given the fact that so many of Interpol’s members are not democracies.

For the U.S., cooperation with Interpol is a question of balancing the risks and rewards, and the balance is very much in favor of U.S. cooperation. But as long as nations such as Iran have any access to Interpol, the U.S. should be aware that they can use Interpol’s system for their own purposes. Accordingly, the U.S. should continue to withhold particularly sensitive data from Interpol and expand the restrictions on the nations and organizations that are allowed to access U.S. data.

Sound Policies and Projects on Firearms

Because of the Second Amendment, the U.S. recognition of the right of individual self-defense, the popularity of the recreational use of firearms in the U.S., and concerns raised by negotiation of the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, it is important to assess whether Interpol could infringe on freedoms protected by the U.S. Constitution.[144] Interpol currently has three firearms projects.

First, the Interpol Firearms Reference Table (IFRT) went into operation in 2008.[145] The IFRT is a database of 250,000 types of firearms with 57,000 pictures that can be accessed through the I-24/7 network. If a police officer in Colombia confiscates what appears to be an Eastern European weapon from a FARC terrorist, the officer can access the IFRT to determine the make and model of the gun. The IFRT can be searched in English or French by a variety of criteria.[146] The IFRT is merely an extensive directory of various models of guns, not a registry of individual firearms.

Second, Interpol operates a Firearms Tracing Instrument. A tracing request is normally transmitted from nation to nation. Thus, if a gun of Belgian manufacture is seized in Canada, the Canadian police can submit a trace request to the Belgian NCB on the I-24/7 network. Nations can also submit queries to the database of stolen or crime guns maintained by Interpol. In order to submit such a query, the requesting agency must fill in a number of mandatory fields, including the make, model, and caliber of the firearm; its country of manufacture and serial number; and the offense alleged to have been committed. Optional fields include proof marks, rifling type, possessor information, and alterations made to the firearm.

It is significant that “offence” is a mandatory field. As long as the requesting NCB is honest, this mandatory field means that Interpol does not assist in tracing guns that are not involved in crimes. Interpol has no direct access to the national registries of law-abiding gun owners that some countries maintain.[147]

Third, the Interpol Ballistic Information Network (IBIN) contains ballistics information. IBIN has received more than 134,000 ballistics records from Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Britain, and Ireland.[148] In the U.S., one jurisdiction—Maryland—collects ballistic information about all new handguns that are lawfully sold, but Interpol does not receive this information. The only U.S. ballistics information in the IBIN is from guns involved in crimes.

More than 50 nations collect ballistics information, and Interpol hopes to receive data from all of them. The data would be shared not only with the collecting nations, but also with regional entities such as Caricom (a group of Caribbean nations) in the hope that the data will identify trends in firearms trafficking. In the long term, as of 2010, Interpol plans to connect national ballistics labs directly so that queries do not need to be routed through Lyons.[149]

As long as Interpol focuses exclusively on guns involved in the commission of crimes, the tracing programs and the IFTR are useful crime-fighting tools that do not infringe on U.S. constitutional freedoms. An analogy to the SLTD may be helpful: Interpol does not have a database of all passports, just those that have been reported as lost or stolen. Likewise, Interpol should continue to collect information only on firearms involved in a crime and to provide information about firearms only when the request is part of a bona fide criminal investigation.

Indeed, the Interpol approach to firearms crime offers a commendable contrast to the U.N.’s efforts. The U.N. provided political assistance to a gun prohibition referendum in Brazil, promotes registries of law-abiding gun owners and gun confiscation programs, denies the existence of the individual right of self-defense, and has declared gun control to be a “human right.”[150] By contrast, Interpol has remained appropriately apolitical and has done nothing to denigrate or interfere with the rights of non-criminal gun owners or the right of democracies such as the United States to define their own policies on the ownership and use of firearms.

Moreover, after the murder of at least 67 people at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, by Islamist terrorists, Secretary General Noble spoke out forcefully about the importance of an armed citizenry to resist terrorist attack:

How do you protect soft targets? That’s really the challenge. You can’t have armed police forces everywhere…. Ask yourself: If that was Denver, Colorado, if that was Texas, would those guys have been able to spend hours, days, shooting people randomly?... What I’m saying is it makes police around the world question their views on gun control. It makes citizens question their views on gun control. You have to ask yourself, “Is an armed citizenry more necessary now than it was in the past with an evolving threat of terrorism?” This is something that has to be discussed. For me it’s a profound question…. People are quick to say “gun control, people shouldn’t be armed,” etc., etc. I think they have to ask themselves: “Where would you have wanted to be? In a city where there was gun control and no citizens armed if you’re in a Westgate mall, or in a place like Denver or Texas?”[151]

In the United States, Noble’s views are well within the standard norms of political debate, but in many other countries, such views are shocking. With his comments, Noble constructively expanded the scope of the global discussion on firearms; given the anti-gun animus of many Interpol member states, his words were courageous.

Interpol’s Legal Immunities in the U.S.

During the mid-1970s, Interpol came under public attack in the U.S. in a campaign orchestrated by the Scientology organization, which charged Interpol with—among other sins—links to Nazism. As one scholar notes, while this campaign did raise “issues concerning not only the administration of international criminal justice, but also the theory and practice of international law-enforcement cooperation,” it was based on “a combination of skilled research and showmanship” that produced “misleading and distorted resource materials.” The campaign successfully stirred up hearings in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives and an investigation by the U.S. General Accounting Office.[152] These investigations led to recommendations for modest reforms in the administration of the U.S. NCB but found no major abuses. The entire affair was heavily colored by the political environment of the 1970s and the conspiratorial flavor of politics in the post-Watergate era.

Since the hearings in the 1970s, Interpol has been controversial in the U.S. primarily because of the legal immunities it has received from several U.S. Administrations. Interpol was formed as an organization of police organizations and thus could be characterized as a nongovernmental organization rather than an international organization because under international law, an international organization is created only by an agreement between national governments. Nevertheless, in 1971, the U.N. recognized Interpol as an international organization.[153]

In 1972, a headquarters agreement between Interpol and the French government gave Interpol formal French recognition as an international organization.[154] This agreement, which was followed by subsequent agreements in 1982 and 2009, gave Interpol full diplomatic immunity for its headquarters, thus immunizing its employees from French criminal prosecutions and civil suits related to actions taken in the course of their official duties.[155]

Over several decades, the U.S. has taken similar steps. The process began in 1945, when Congress enacted the International Organization Immunities Act (IOIA).[156] The act provides some legal immunities to international organizations and their staffs, but not the full diplomatic immunity that is enjoyed by foreign diplomats in embassies and consulates. The President decides whether a particular international organization will receive immunity and may limit the immunities granted.

The primary reason why international organizations receive these immunities is that they are intended to be independent bodies, outside the jurisdiction of any one member nation. The immunities protect the independent functioning of the international organizations and shield them from vexatious litigation. By agreeing to become a member of such an organization, and by agreeing to its presence on U.S. soil, the U.S. implicitly accepts the obligation to accord it the relevant privileges. As a practical matter, international organizations would be reluctant to maintain a presence in the U.S., or any other country, if these immunities were not granted.

The IOIA became relevant to Interpol in 1981, when the D.C. Circuit held in Steinberg v. International Criminal Police Organization that Interpol could be sued in federal courts.[157] Leon Steinberg, the plaintiff, pleaded a strong case for defamation:

Steinberg’s complaint identifies an Interpol document, titled “Blue International Notification 500/59-A3674,” describing him as a wanted international criminal who used the alias “Mark Moscowitz.” Interpol widely communicated the Notification, Steinberg alleges, to its liaisons, among them, the United States National Central Bureau (USNCB), now located in the Department of Justice, this country’s liaison with Interpol. In the summer of 1975, on learning of the document and Interpol’s transmission of it to liaisons, Steinberg asserts, he notified Interpol and twice offered proof that the Notification was erroneous. Despite the proof he offered, Steinberg further states, Interpol continued to publish the Notification and other statements associating Steinberg with “Mark Moscowitz.” It did so, according to Steinberg, until late July 1976, when Interpol finally conceded Leon Steinberg was not “Mark Moscowitz.” Steinberg seeks general and punitive damages for the substantial injury he alleges he has suffered as a result of the Blue International Notification.

Now vulnerable to U.S. lawsuits, Interpol asked the Reagan Administration to grant it selected IOIA immunities. In the context of its burgeoning focus on working more closely with Interpol, it is not surprising that President Ronald Reagan signed Executive Order 12425 in 1983, designating Interpol as an international organization for purposes of U.S. law.[158]In 1995, President Bill Clinton extended additional IOIA immunities to Interpol relating to customs duties, foreign agent registration, import taxes, and protection of its official communications.[159]

Neither of these executive orders granted Interpol full IOIA immunities because Interpol had no office in the U.S. and therefore had no need for the IOIA’s protections of international organization property and files, a business exemption from business taxes, or employee exemption from U.S. income taxes. But in 2004, Interpol opened a five-employee office in New York City that works with the United Nations. The primary work of this office revolves around supporting sanctions issued by the U.N. Security Council, including those on al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Interpol’s New York office also works with the Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee, promotes the use of the SLTD database through the U.N., and supports the deployment of police officers as part of U.N. peacekeeping missions.[160]

Thus, during President George W. Bush’s second term, Interpol requested that it be granted the remaining IOIA immunities to protect its U.S. property and employees from searches, seizures, and taxes. The Department of State reviewed the request and forwarded it to the White House, but President Bush did not act on the request.

On December 17, 2009, President Barack Obama signed an amendment to the 1983 Reagan executive order, granting Interpol the remaining IOIA immunities.[161] Interpol now has the same legal status in the U.S. as approximately 75 other international organizations, including the United Nations, the World Meteorological Organization, the World Trade Organization, and the Pacific Salmon Commission.

Interpol is an organization for the international distribution of crime-related information. It is not a law enforcement agency that has the power to arrest or detain a person, search someone’s property, or do anything else that only law enforcement officers can do legally. Interpol employees have no law enforcement powers and do not carry firearms. If an Interpol employee in the U.S. ever purported to arrest someone, illegally conducted a search, or did anything else for which criminal or civil liability should attach, the proper course for the President would be to seriously consider revoking the executive orders granting Interpol its IOIA immunities. There have to date been no instances of such conduct by Interpol in the U.S.

The immunities Interpol has been granted by successive U.S. administrations are identical to those possessed by many other international organizations. The U.S. may ultimately find it necessary to amend the 1983 executive order to end Interpol’s immunity for libelous diffusions until such time as Interpol ceases to allow circulation of diffusions that do not expire rapidly or are not promptly reviewed by Interpol’s staff. However, that would be a very significant step, and the U.S. should exhaust other approaches for reforming Interpol’s diffusion system before considering whether to take it.

What the United States Should Do

The United States should:

Continue to support and work through Interpol. As long as Interpol remains scrupulously committed in word and deed to its 1956 constitution, reforms its use of diffusions, and continues its sensible approach to firearms crime and increased awareness of the importance of data protection, the U.S. should not fundamentally alter its relationship with Interpol. The U.S. should, however, recognize that all bureaucracies tend to engage in empire-building. To the extent that future growth makes Interpol more effective and useful, the U.S. should support it, but the U.S. should not unquestioningly accept the institutional growth of an organization that it funds but does not control. By the same token, Interpol should recognize that continued U.S. support depends not on any further expansion but on remaining committed to its core mission and performing its current functions responsibly and capably.

Continue to promote greater interagency cooperation with the U.S. NCB. In September 2009, the Audit Division of the Office of the Inspector General in the U.S. Department of Justice submitted a report which found that the NCB “has not fully made international criminal information … available to appropriate law enforcement agencies in the United States…. This has increased the potential that high-risk, violent criminals can enter [the U.S.] undetected.” The report further found that of the 52 foreign-source notices and diffusions examined, approximately 87 percent did not have a corresponding record in the FBI’s National Crime Information Center. Even more surprisingly, 14 of the 32 “most-wanted” fugitives sought by the FBI, the DEA, and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement were not subject to Red Notices. The FBI Assistant Director for International Operations did not know why, against the FBI’s policy, the FBI’s 10 Most Wanted fugitives were not all named in Red Notices.[162] This was regrettable because, while some nations may not be willing to act against an individual on the basis of information provided directly by the U.S., they may be willing to act on the basis of a Red Notice that derives from a U.S. request. The NCB has responded to the 2009 report by emphasizing interagency cooperation, and the number of detailees currently serving at the NCB is evidence that this emphasis has produced results. This reform deserves support and continued enhancement by executive agencies and Congress. In addition to continuing to improve this form of interagency cooperation, the NCB should systematically cross-check the U.S. Treasury’s List of Specially Designated Nationals to ensure that every individual on it who is the subject of a U.S. arrest warrant or court order is named in an appropriate Interpol notice or diffusion.[163] Finally, the U.S. should support the U.N. Counter-Terrorism Committee in its recently announced intention to improve cooperation with Interpol, and the U.S. should seek to ensure that the individuals and organizations that the committee identifies as associated with terrorism are also designed appropriately by Interpol.[164]

Report on information about U.S. citizens provided to or received from Interpol. There are a number of actions that the U.S. can take within Interpol to exercise its prerogatives more effectively. The number and size of the databases maintained by Interpol and the number of notices and diffusions that it issues or transmits have grown steadily over the past decade. By itself, this is not a cause for concern, but given the rising volume of usage, the increased number of U.S. and foreign agencies that can access the Interpol system, and the new ease with which all agencies can access and modify data and issue provisional Red Notices through Interpol’s I-24/7 and I-Link systems, the U.S. should not rely solely on the unaccountable members of Interpol’s CCF to protect U.S. citizens. Congress should require the U.S. NCB to publish an annual public report providing a summary total—without revealing private information or prejudicing ongoing investigations—of the records on U.S. citizens that it made available to Interpol and of the notices and diffusions that it received, requested, or transmitted related to U.S. citizens. This report should also categorize the NCB’s activities by the type of criminal offense (or other cause) that led it to take these actions.

Limit by statute the data that the U.S. submits to Interpol. The low number of U.S. fingerprint records in the database maintained by Interpol implies that the U.S. has taken a responsible approach to providing data to Interpol, but Congress should enact a statute limiting the U.S. NCB to submitting fingerprints, DNA, or other identifying information only in cases relevant to one of Interpol’s notices, including those in which an individual is wanted for a felony offense, a felony has been committed by an unknown perpetrator, or an individual is missing. Consonant with Interpol’s rules on data retention, Congress should also require the NCB to review at least monthly all outstanding notices, diffusions, and records it has requested, transmitted, or provided on U.S. citizens and to cancel or delete those that are related to cases where the individual sought is in U.S. custody, the information is no longer relevant to an ongoing investigation, or the individual has been cleared of the relevant charges.[165] The U.S. NCB should be required to include a summary of this activity in its annual public report to Congress.

Promote greater openness in Interpol. While Interpol can never be completely transparent because this would prejudice the rights of the accused and hamper ongoing investigations, it should be more open about the notice requests it receives, its review process, and the occasions on which it rejects notice requests on the grounds that they do not comply with Article 3 or other relevant rules. Interpol is committed to compiling a “repository of practice on the application of Article 3,” but this is currently supposed to be made available only to NCBs and other national and international entities.[166] Interpol should publish the criteria that it uses to assess whether a case violates Article 3. Even more important, Interpol should publish more data about the requests it receives and rejects. Interpol occasionally issues a press release when it decides a particularly controversial case. This is welcome, but it also highlights the fact that most cases receive no publicity at all.[167] By rejecting notice requests without making any regular public report, Interpol in effect encourages nations that seek to misuse its system to try again. Secretary General Noble has asserted that the idea that nations that abuse Interpol’s rules should not be allowed to use its channels is “one of the most dangerous proposals I have heard,” even though Article 131 of Interpol’s Rules on the Processing of Data clearly states that this is a possible sanction for abusive behavior.[168] Noble argues that even rogue regimes such as Gaddafi’s Libya have criminals who need to be pursued. This is certainly correct, but law enforcement agencies do not exist merely to pursue criminals: They must also protect the rights of the innocent and the accused.[169] Noble’s assertions strongly imply that Interpol is not inclined to apply the sanctions created by its own rules. This illustrates today’s reality: Abusive behavior goes largely unpublicized, carries no sanction, and is too readily justified by the argument that even abusive states have criminals. This is unacceptable. The U.S. should press Interpol to adopt a policy of annually publishing a summary report, sorted by individual nation, of the number of notice requests received from each nation, the outcome of Interpol’s internal review of these requests, and the number of the notices rejected on Article 3 or other specified grounds. The report should not name any individuals. The U.S. also should promote greater openness in the CCF and encourage it to publish precise procedures and an indicative timetable for use by individuals challenging Interpol notices and diffusions, its decision criteria, and a redacted form of its decisions in all cases. This would establish a body of case law for use by applicants and so the public can evaluate whether the CCF is working as intended. Until Interpol’s rules are changed to make it impossible for autocracies to be represented on the CCF, the U.S. should work closely with other democracies inside Interpol to ensure that CCF appointees come exclusively from democratic nations. The U.S. should seek to ensure that there is always a U.S. citizen on the CCF, expanding the size of that body modestly if necessary. The U.S. also should seek to speed up the operation of the CCF and to create a procedure for expedited CCF review, if necessary by providing the CCF with additional resources in Interpol and by requiring NCBs to respond to CCF inquiries within a reasonable time period. Under the current system, the CCF can take more than a year to conclude its investigations. When an autocratic regime is using Interpol to target an individual unjustly, this procedure is too leisurely.[170] Finally, while an individual who may be named in a notice or diffusion can apply to the CCF for the “right of access to personal information,” the CCF can supply this information only “subject to the agreement of the source”—the source being the nation that provided the information.[171] This means that autocracies can accuse an individual through the notice or diffusion system and then forbid Interpol from revealing the information justifying the accusation, or even the fact that a notice or diffusion exists at all, unless the complainant can provide “proof that he knew of the existence of information about him in Interpol’s files.” In other words, an individual with a complaint must prove to Interpol that the complainant knows that Interpol knows something before Interpol will admit that they know it.[172] It is important to maintain the principle that nations own the data they provide to Interpol, but the current procedure is unduly burdensome. On a domestic level, sealed arrest warrants exist primarily to avoid alerting fugitives that they are wanted. When an individual voluntarily contacts Interpol and inquires about the existence of a notice, any element of surprise in the case has obviously been lost. The U.S. should press Interpol to adopt, in all cases where the named individual or the individual’s legal representative applies to the CCF, a policy of revealing the existence of a notice or diffusion, the nation that requested or transmitted the relevant instrument, and the nature of the charge that justified or occasioned the notice or diffusion. Applicants should not be required to prove that they know Interpol has information on their cases. Instead, they should be required to demonstrate that they have a reasonable basis for believing that Interpol has relevant information. This requirement would shield Interpol from the legal need to reply to repetitive communications from unbalanced individuals while still requiring it to reply to legitimate inquiries. This change would not allow fugitives to evade capture by obtaining information from the CCF. Applicants would need to reveal their location, and would still need to show persistence and take time to demonstrate a reasonable basis for their inquiries.

Protect U.S. citizens unjustly targeted by an Interpol notice or diffusion. The overwhelming majority of Interpol notices and diffusions appear to raise no concerns, but the cases of Shahram Homayoun and Ilya Katsnelson, among others, show the need for action on the small minority of Interpol notices and diffusions that unjustly target U.S. citizens, particularly because the consequences of unjust targeting are severe. Acting in collaboration with other executive agencies, the U.S. NCB reportedly assesses some Red Notices as politically motivated, although the NCB has not confirmed this report.[173] Congress should empower and require the NCB to issue a formal and public assessment when the NCB determines, as informed by consultation with other executive agencies, that a particular notice or diffusion is unjust and politicized, is based on a theory of universal jurisdiction, is an effort to criminalize speech, or constitutes a violation of Article 3 or other applicable Interpol rules. In such cases, Congress should require the NCB to work with the State Department, the Treasury, and other executive agencies to protect the rights and freedoms of the targeted individual, including the individual’s ability to travel abroad and use the banking and financial system. Congress should both empower and require the State Department to liaise with the NCB to inform the NCB of cases that deserve interagency review with the clear understanding that it is Congress’s intent to protect all U.S. citizens—not merely selected or prominent individuals—from such notices or diffusions. Congress should require the NCB to request the annotation of the Interpol record of any U.S. citizen sought by a nation with which the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty. This annotation should note that the U.S. will not extradite a U.S. citizen in the absence of such a treaty and that the U.S. will regard extradition by another nation as an unfriendly act.[174] Congress should also create a legal pathway for U.S. citizens to supply information directly to the NCB to initiate a formal interagency review of a potentially problematic case and should require the NCB to issue an annual report to Congress on the actions it has taken in confirmed instances of abuse of the Interpol system to protect U.S. citizens. If these practices prove insufficient, the U.S. should consider adapting the precedent of its Article 98 agreements—bilateral non-surrender agreements that protect American citizens from the International Criminal Court—to the Interpol context.[175] The U.S. could conclude bilateral agreements with fellow democracies agreeing that neither nation will surrender nationals from the other nation to a third party on the strength of an Interpol notice or diffusion without mutual consultation and agreement and that, if extradition is refused, they would work together to protect the liberties of the individual concerned. Such agreements would not prevent Interpol notices and diffusions from operating, but they would allow the U.S. and other democracies to protect their nationals from abuse of the Interpol system. They would establish a network of democracies that are mutually pledged both to surrender justly requested criminals and to uphold the standards underlying Article 3 of Interpol’s constitution.

Require the U.S. NCB to challenge unjust notices and diffusions. The U.S. cannot assume the responsibility of reviewing and assessing all Interpol notices and diffusions; other democratic governments and U.S. and foreign NGOs also have a vital role to play in monitoring Interpol. Indeed, the case for the establishment of an NGO that focuses exclusively on monitoring Interpol is strong. Moreover, Interpol has the primary responsibility for living up to its own standards. But Congress should require the U.S. NCB, working with the State Department and other executive agencies, to request an IPSG review when Interpol publishes a notice or distributes a diffusion on an individual who is not a U.S. citizen but who has a personal or business nexus with the U.S. that the NCB has credible reason for believing is unjust and politicized, is based on a theory of universal jurisdiction, is an effort to criminalize speech, or constitutes a violation of Article 3 or other applicable Interpol rules. Congress should also empower and require the State Department to liaise with the NCB to inform the NCB of cases that deserve interagency review. Finally, Congress should create a legal pathway for U.S. citizens to supply information directly to the NCB to initiate a formal process of interagency review of a potentially problematic case. If Interpol decides after review not to rescind the notice or diffusion, the NCB should be empowered and required to issue a public assessment that the notice or diffusion is abusive. The NCB should be required to request the annotation of the relevant Interpol file to note the U.S.’s assessment and its determination not to extradite the individual in question. The NCB should be legally mandated to work with the State Department, other executive agencies, and other democratic governments to protect the individual’s rights insofar as the individual’s nexus with the U.S. brings them under U.S. jurisdiction. The broader point is that the U.S. should not complacently accept the fact that Interpol treats autocracies as the equal of democracies. It should exercise its rights within the Interpol system, as should other democracies. As Secretary General Noble pointed out, not one Interpol member nation exercised its right to challenge Russia’s use of Interpol’s channels to locate William Browder. Only Browder himself issued a challenge.[176] Browder is a British subject, but public comments by leading British officials while Interpol was considering Russia’s abusive request were complacent.[177] This is unsatisfactory. U.S. cooperation with Interpol should be pragmatic, and like other democracies, the U.S. should make full use of its right to challenge problematic notices and diffusions through Interpol’s channels.

Announce a formal policy of refusing to act on Interpol notices or diffusions from dictatorships that are not allowed access to U.S. data supplied to Interpol. The U.S. decision to ignore Interpol notices published at the request of Communist dictatorships in the late 1940s is a useful precedent. The U.S. should announce formally that it will not act on any notices or diffusions that are published at the request of or transmitted by anti-U.S. dictatorships, that are published at the request of or transmitted by the ICC, that are based on a claim of universal jurisdiction, or that attempt to criminalize speech. At a minimum, the list of dictatorships should include the regimes that are not allowed to access U.S. data supplied to Interpol. It is extremely unlikely that the U.S. would wish to extradite any individual to Iran, Sudan, or Syria, and the U.S. should not support transnational institutions such as the ICC, lend support to theories of universal jurisdiction, or extradite individuals for exercising rights protected under the U.S. Constitution.

Expand the list of nations and organizations that cannot access U.S. data. Currently, the list includes Iran, Sudan, Syria, and the ICC.[178] The U.S. should add Cuba and Venezuela to this list: They are anti-American dictatorships, and Venezuela, in particular, has been credibly described as one of Interpol’s most abusive member nations.[179] It should also carefully monitor Egypt’s actions, as under the now-deposed Morsi regime, Egypt demonstrated its desire to use Interpol to target U.S. citizens for political purposes. Russia’s ongoing and serious pattern of abuse of the Interpol system raises the serious question of whether it should also be added to the list. Other nations should be added to or removed from the list as their actions in Interpol and elsewhere merit. The U.S. should announce that it will terminate the access other nations have to U.S. data if they abuse the Interpol system. The U.S should exercise particular caution about allowing continued foreign access to U.S. data when a change of government or regime or the widespread nationalization of private property is followed by a sudden increase in notices or diffusions alleging financial crimes, which appear (as in the Katsnelson case) to be a particular favorite of autocratic regimes. This declaratory policy would help to deter abuse of Interpol and U.S. citizens in the future. Congress should prohibit ICC access to U.S. data by statute and should require congressional authorization before U.S. data are shared with any other international tribunal. The U.S. could still cooperate on a case-by-case basis with international tribunals, but only after cong","Wed, 11 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png,"['interpols', 'nations', 'working', 'interpol', 'notices', 'international', 'interest', 'information', 'necessary', 'notice', 'red', 'request', 'ncb', 'reforms']",

SCOTTISH fashion designer Niki Taylor was leading a glamorous life, creating outfits for celebs including Alexa Chung and singer Florence Welch and travelling the world with her Olanic label.

But she has traded all that in for a more settled lifestyle and is now helping new designers – and expecting her first baby.

Olanic was worn by singer Marina & The Diamonds, and had shows at London and Paris fashion weeks but now Niki, 40, from Glasgow has set up an online store called The Top Project. It promotes and encourages young designers to create stylish, unique and sustainable garments.

“Having my own label was an amazing experience and I got to travel the world and meet great people,” she said.

“It was very exciting. Dressing celebrities helps the profile of your business but you don’t make money from it because celebrities don’t pay.

“After taking some time out due to illness, I realised I wanted a change and felt the urge to do something creative but that also helped others.

“I hosted a T-shirt workshop in an orphanage in Indonesia and enjoyed enabling young people to create their own designs. I decided to use that experience back home.

“I’m a bit obsessed with tops – blouses, T-shirts, sweatshirts – and that’s where the inspiration for the business came from. I wanted to start something that would have a positive effect.

“This project combines everything I love – from prints and vintage clothing to new and eclectic designs, and supporting young artists.”

While Niki was changing her work life, she also married Rick Fleming, 42, who has a landscaping business.

But although she wanted to have a baby, she’d almost given up hope.

“I’ve always imagined myself having children but then I’d been trying for four years and it just wasn’t happening,” she said.

She was delighted to fall pregnant, with the baby due next week. But she’s still finding time to concentrate on her other baby – her work with The Top Project.

Niki and her team work with five Scottish-based designers, supporting and advising them in creating exclusive designs. She buys the final print from them and selects a fabric and cut that will transform it into a top-quality garment.

All the manufacturing and printing is done in Scotland, using organic cotton. The site also features designs by Niki using a variety of materials including recycled silk.

Niki, who graduated from Heriot-Watt, is collaborating with other businesses in Glasgow, including ethical fashion store Think Boutique and running swap shops.

“I want to raise awareness of how clothes have become disposable, adding to harmful landfill,” she said.

“Our customers love the fact that they are buying exclusive garments that they can only get through us.

“It’s been great to launch in Scotland with Scottish-based designers. We are a company that wants to show that ethical clothing doesn’t need to be beige but is design-led, with the added bonus of being sustainable and supporting the local community.

“I went to Business Gateway as a first port of call when I decided to set up The Top Project and through it I discovered the Women Into Business network.

“Mixing with other female business owners, learning from them and having their support was an enormous confidence boost.

“I am also due to attend some of Business Gateway’s free workshops to help me with other business issues.”

* Business Gateway provide practical help, advice and support for new and growing businesses throughout Scotland.

97,97,FL-2013-000155-IDN,PHILIPPINES Bishops against the anti-ecological reclamation of Manila Bay - AsiaNews.it,http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Bishops-against-the-anti-ecological-reclamation-of-Manila-Bay-29875.html,"In an open letter to President Aquino, 21 bishops call for a halt to projects that are likely to jeopardize the ecosystem of Manila Bay. It cites 38 actions that are of ""deep concern"" even among scientists and environmentalists. The head of state, warn the bishops, must look to the ""common good"" not ""financial interests"" .

Manila ( AsiaNews / EDA ) - In an open letter to President Benigno Aquino , 21 Filipino bishops - including Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle - are asking him to stop the reclamation projects of Manila Bay, which threaten to alter forever the delicate eco-system in the area. In the letter, written November 19, but only published these days, the bishops express their "" deepest concern "" about 38 work in progress, intended to ""renew"" the coastal area of the capital. According to plans, the reclamation works would allow create large portions of land, to the detriment of the sea. However , the bishops warn, the work as a whole is likely to have "" dramatic consequences "" on the local flora and fauna and people .



In the framework of the National Reclamation Plan, the Aquino government wants to launch 102 projects of urbanization, which will cover 38 thousand hectares of coastline, of which 70 % (or 38 projects and an area of ​​almost 27 thousand hectares ) in Manila Bay. Of these 38 projects , there are three in particular that raise deep concern and perplexity among the prelates , supported by authoritative scientific studies and battles of environmental groups.



The first concerns the construction of a giant fairground for tourists in Manila, over 148 acres large and renamed ""Solar City"". A second would occupy 300 acres in Las Pinas / Paranaque , and the third would extend over an area of ​​300 hectares in Pasay . The last two places are included in the metropolitan area of the Philippine capital.



Relying on findings from in-depth scientific research, the 21 bishops warn the government against the dangers arising from indiscriminate reclamation of the bay. It will worsen the effects of already catastrophic flooding, that cyclically affect the areas . Similarly, portions of land stolen from the sea will be even more exposed to the heavy rains and flash floods that always accompany typhoons, as was the case in 2011 for the Cyclone Pedring and in November this year with the devastating typhoon Yolanda . Finally, the continuous seepage of water into the ground, where fragile foundations of buildings and structures would be placed, will leave them without any resistance to violent earthquakes that hit these regions.



It is not the first time that environmental movements, the Filipino Catholic Church and international NGOs have formed a united front on sensitive issues , asking instead for focus efforts on the development of ""cultural riches "" which the territory already offers. This particularly applies to the Manila Bay area which should be maintained and enhanced rather than endangering the coast with an "" irretrievable degradation of the environment .""



In a letter to President Aquino, the bishops are asking whether the authorization that has given the go-ahead to projects is not only ""determined by mere financial interests "" ; the prelates recall the duties to which the head of state is bound, which include the duty ""to ensure the common good,"" and not only consider the profits which benefit only the promoters of the ( alleged) development programs of the bay. Finally, ensuring Aquino ""their prayers,"" the bishops conclude the call expressing their confidence that he will choose "" the best solution "" to solve a problem that worries ""all the people of the Philippines .""","Sat, 21 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/FILIPPINE_(F)_1217_-_vescovi_e_bonifica.jpg,"['aquino', 'president', 'reclamation', 'letter', 'projects', 'warn', 'bishops', 'bay', 'antiecological', 'area', '38']",
