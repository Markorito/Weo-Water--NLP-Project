The flooding, which was triggered by heavy rains that caused three rivers to overflow, began on Monday evening and has since affected more than 4,000 residents of six subdistricts in North Luwu.

Raditya Jati, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said on Wednesday that mud covering the main road into North Luwu district had blocked access to affected areas.

“The latest update from National Search and Rescue Agency 16 people dead and we are looking for 23 people,” Jati said.

In one village, photographs showed a damaged house and a truck partially submerged under thick mud, while a runway at a local airport was also swamped by mud and debris.

“I hope we will be united in our recovery efforts,” Nurdin Abdullah, the governor of South Sulawesi, said on Kompas TV.

Indonesia frequently suffers from floods and landslides particularly during the rainy season, though the situation is often made worse by the cutting down of forests.

In January, flooding killed 66 people in the capital, Jakarta, amid some of the heaviest rain since records began.","Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7b5189c179784358ab28990cb9d36df6_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['kill', 'village', 'landslides', 'indonesia', 'north', 'flash', 'sulawesi', 'south', 'search', '23', '16', 'floods', 'submerged', 'mud', 'truck', 'affected', 'missing']",

Severe flooding that hit North Luwu regency, South Sulawesi, last week claimed at least 38 lives, while dozens more remain missing, authorities reported on Monday.

“As of Monday, the joint rescue team has recorded a total of 38 casualties,” Makassar National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas) spokesperson Rizal said as quoted by kompas.com.

On Sunday, the joint team found two victims in Pombakka village, West Malangke district.

“One was a female, estimated to be aged 23, and another victim, a male, was found at the Masamba River, Bone Tua subdistrict,” he said.

Rizal explained that the two bodies, which were taken to Hikmah Masamba Hospital, had not yet been identified.

According to a report by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency on Sunday, 40 people were reportedly missing. The disaster also injured 58 people and caused 14,483 from Sabbang, Baebunta and Masamba districts to flee from their homes.

“The search was continued this morning around Pombakka village, the location where the two victims were found last time. We will also continue the search around the river banks and around Salu Tuara Bridge, which is full of wood [debris],” Rizal added.

The severe flooding was caused by heavy rainfall that began Sunday last week, causing three rivers – the Masamba, Rongkong and Mely – to overflow. Hundreds of houses and public facilities were buried under 3 to 5 meters of mud. Access to Masamba and Radda villages in Baebunta district was also blocked off by 2-meter-deep mud.

“The flow of the river in North Luwu is quite stable under daily conditions. However, based on further analysis, the inclined upstream slope is not supported by stable soil aggregate,” South Sulawesi Governor Nurdin Abdullah said.

He added that the rain intensity over three days was quite high, with 100 to 200 millimeters of rain falling daily.

“It is a lesson for all of us. First, we need to normalize the rivers. Second, we need to think of the safety of people living near the river banks. Third, [human] activities around the upstream must be evaluated further.” (trn)","Tue, 21 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/07/14/2020_07_14_100186_1594737428._large.jpg,"['village', 'team', 'upstream', '38', 'dozens', 'sulawesi', 'south', 'search', 'masamba', 'reportedly', 'flood', 'river', 'kills', 'national', 'victims', 'week', 'missing']",

JAKARTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Search and rescue operations were still under way Saturday as flash floods and landslides hit Indonesia's South Sulawesi province, leaving 67 people missing and more than 14,000 others displaced, officials said.

After retrieving 36 bodies, the rescuers focused their efforts in the villages of Sabbang, Baebunta, Pontaden, Meli, and Masamba city, the areas hardest hit in Luwu Utara district, said Zaenal Asad, an official in charge at the Provincial Search and Rescue Office.

""The mud has submerged the villages by up to two meters high. Most of the bodies were recovered from the mud. Logs were also found on roads and many other spots, slowing the rescuers' efforts,"" he told Xinhua via phone.

Heavy machinery equipment has been deployed to the area to help 359 rescuers in the mission, Asad said.

Separately, Head of the Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency Doni Monardo noted that 67 people remained missing and 51 others were injured.

As many as 14,388 residents have been taking shelter in safer grounds, he said in a statement on Saturday.

Monardo asked affected people to keep applying health protocols amid the natural disaster.

""As we are still in the situation of virus pandemic, the health protocols have to be imposed in Luwu Utara,"" he said when visiting the disaster-hit areas in the district.

Compensation would be provided to those whose houses are destroyed by the flooding.

The flash floods also hit a road, nine bridges, 13 religious buildings, nine school buildings, eight office buildings, two public facilities and a market place, according to the agency.

Melawi, Ketapang and Sintang, West Kalimantan

Heavy rainfall along with strong winds have caused flooding in several districts in West Kalimantan province commencing on Wednesday, 8 July 2020. By 16 July 2020, water levels had receded in two districts, Kapuas Hulu and Sanggau but three districts, including Melawi, Sintang and Ketapang, were still inundated, with water levels ranging from 200 - 700 centimeters. The flooding in Melawi district is due to the overflowing of Melawi and Pinoh rivers which have submerged residential areas in nine sub-districts.

Approximately 16,971 households or 65,531 people have been affected, and six houses have been severely damaged. The worst flood impacts have been felt in Sayan, Tanah Pinoh, and Sokan sub-districts. Flooding in Sintang district submerged 29 villages in three sub-districts including, Serawai Kayan Hulu and Kayan Hilir. 7,243 households where 29,210 people have been affected and damaged 59 houses in Kayan Hilir district. In Ketapang district, the flood resulted from the overflow of the Malay Rayak river, which has submerged 35 villages in four subdistricts. Approximately 3,462 households where 12,135 people have been affected. In Sanggau and Kapuas Hulu districts, the flood conditions have started to recede, and the community is beginning to clean up their homes.

Residential areas alongside the overflowing rivers remain flooding, with water level reaching 1.5 meter. Many affected families are staying on the second floor of their houses, and those whose houses do not have a second floor are staying temporarily with their relatives or neighbors who have the second floors that can accommodate them. The floods have not only submerged residential areas but also several public facilities such as mosques, churches, schools and bridges as well as community-owned plantations which has affected livelihoods.","Thu, 23 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1528235-MDRID017do.png?itok=Q_5EpMYk,"['second', 'sintang', 'operation', 'subdistricts', 'west', 'water', 'epoa', 'plan', 'district', 'houses', 'indonesia', 'flooding', 'south', 'districts', 'affected', 'kalimantan', 'sulawesi', 'floods', 'submerged', 'mdrid017']",

Vast swathes of China have been inundated by the worst flooding in decades along the mighty Yangtze River, with residents piling into boats and makeshift rafts to escape a deluge that has collapsed flood defenses and turned their homes into waterways.

Heavy rains since June have left at least 141 people dead and missing, forced nearly 15 million people to be evacuated from their homes in July alone, and caused billions of dollars in economic losses, according to the government.

An AFP photographer travelled through central Jiangxi, floating past partly submerged villages and towns as rescue workers battled to repair levees and dykes as forecasters warned of yet more rain.

Waters in more than 400 rivers have exceeded warning levels, while some have reached historic highs over a period that officials say has caused the highest average rainfall levels across the Yangtze basin since 1961.

Summer rains and seasonal glacial melt in the river's Tibetan plateau headwaters cause routine annual flooding.

Authorities are particularly concerned with Poyang Lake -- China's largest freshwater lake -- in hard-hit Jiangxi province.

Water levels there have hit historic highs, prompting an effort by more than 100,000 soldiers and other personnel to rescue residents and shore up dykes and levees to prevent worse flooding.

Dramatic improvement is not expected anytime soon.

Fresh rains far upstream have caused a ""rapidly increasing inflow"" to the reservoir created by the massive Three Gorges Dam, state media said, citing authorities.

The government has so far said that the dam -- condemned by environmentalists for upsetting the river's ecology and for the forced relocation of millions of residents -- can handle the increased load.

Critics say the summer flooding threat has worsened over the decades due in part to rampant overdevelopment and poor water conservancy policies such as overbuilding of ill-advised dams and levees.

State media said Thursday that authorities also had issued a warning for the Huaihe River, another major Chinese waterway to the north of the Yangtze, as its waters continued to rise.","Fri, 17 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/07/17/2020_07_17_100396_1594972507._large.jpg,"['warning', 'force', 'rains', 'residents', 'homes', 'china', 'rivers', 'yangtze', 'central', 'river', 'floods', 'levels', 'rescue', 'say', 'millions', 'caused']",

Nearly four million people in India's northeastern state of Assam and neighboring Nepal have been displaced by heavy flooding from monsoon rains, with dozens missing as deaths rose to at least 189, government officials said on Sunday.

The overflowing Brahmaputra River, which flows through China's Tibet, India and Bangladesh, has damaged crops and triggered mudslides, displacing millions of people, officials said.

More than 2.75 million people in Assam have been displaced by three waves of floods since late May that has claimed 79 lives after two more deaths were reported overnight, a state government official said.

""The flood situation remains critical with most of the rivers flowing menacingly above the danger mark,"" Assam water resources Minister Keshab Mahanta told Reuters.

Assam is facing the twin challenge of combating floods and the coronavirus pandemic. Out of 33 districts, 25 remained affected after the current wave of flooding, beginning a fortnight ago.

India is grappling with the novel coronavirus, which has infected nearly 1.1 million people and 26,816 have died from the COVID-19 disease, government data showed on Sunday.

In neighboring Nepal, the government asked residents along its southern plains on Sunday to remain alert as heavy monsoon rains were expected to pound the Himalayan nation where more than 100 have died in floods and landslides since June, officials said.

Some 110 people were killed and another 100 injured as landslides and flash floods washed or swept away homes, upended roads and bridges and displaced hundreds of others in 26 of the country's 77 districts, police said.

Home ministry official Murari Wasti said the death toll was expected to rise as 48 people were still missing.

""Search and rescue teams are looking for those who are missing in different places but chances of finding them alive are slim,"" Wasti told Reuters.

Barun Paudel of the weather forecasting office in the capital, Kathmandu, said heavy rains were expected to pound much of the mainly mountainous nation in the next four days.

""We have urged residents to remain alert against possible landslides and floods,"" he said.

Deadly flooding will persist in Bangladesh for the next 10 days, officials warned Tuesday, as South Asia battles torrential monsoon rains which have already pounded the region for weeks.

In flood-prone Bangladesh -- where almost one-third of the impoverished nation is underwater -- officials warned of an extended disaster in one of the worst deluges in recent years.

""The flood has been going on for at least 20 days,"" the deputy chief of Bangladesh's Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, Udoy Raihan, told AFP, adding that flooding usually lasted two weeks.

""And it is likely continue for another 10 days due to heavy rains in Bangladesh and India.""

The annual monsoon is critical for replenishing water supplies, but also wreaks havoc across vast swathes of the densely populated region, causing widespread death and damage.

At least 81 people have died in Bangladesh, mostly from drowning, officials said, with almost three million people hit by the natural disaster through flooded homes and inundated communities.

In Srinagar, a rural town just outside the capital Dhaka, some villagers fled to evacuation centers while others slept on boats and rafts made out of banana trunks lashed together with ropes to watch over their flooded homes.

""The last time we saw such flood was in 1998. We haven't seen such dangerous floods since then,"" Sheikh Moslem, 66, told AFP.

Sufia Begum, 40, said the flood levels were up to her neck.

""I am more worried about my two cows,"" she told AFP as she looked at her submerged home and cowshed. ""They are my only source of income. I can't leave them here.""

In India's northeastern state of Assam, conditions eased as the death toll since the start of July edged up to 58 people.

Many villagers whose homes were not fully submerged said they preferred to stay with their belongings despite the difficult conditions, and were being given food and water supplies from the government and local aid agencies.

""There is ankle-deep water inside our home. We will stay here until it's not manageable,"" Anima Begum, 40, told AFP from the Morigaon district in Assam.

At Assam's World Heritage-listed Kaziranga National Park, 116 animals have died so far, including nine rare one-horned rhinos.

In neighboring Nepal, the government issued a fresh warning about rising river levels for the next three days as rescuers searched for 51 people missing in landslides and floods.

""Rescue and relief efforts are going on and we are on alert for areas at risk,"" Nepal's National Emergency Operation Centre chief Murari Wasti said.

More than one million people in Phnom Penh face the risk of increased flooding and loss of livelihoods as wetlands in the Cambodian capital are destroyed to build apartments and industries, human rights groups warned on Monday.

Developments - including the ING City township - will reduce the Tompoun wetlands to less than a tenth of its 1,500 hectares (5.8 sq miles), and lead to the eviction of more than 1,000 families who live on its edge, activists said in a report.

It would also impoverish thousands of families who farm and fish in the wetlands in the city of 1.5 million people.

""The wetlands sustain local communities and play a vital role in Phnom Penh's waste management and flood prevention,"" said the report from Equitable Cambodia, LICADHO, the Cambodian Youth Network and land rights group Sahmakum Teang Tnaut (STT).

""Millions of Cambodians will likely be affected by the potentially devastating impacts of destroying the wetlands.""

Phnom Penh, situated on the banks of the Tonle Sap, Mekong and Bassac rivers, is already highly vulnerable to floods, particularly in the rainy season from June to October.

Lakes and wetlands such as floodplains, mangroves and marshes regulate water flow, minimize flooding, purify water and replenish groundwater, said Diane Archer, a senior research fellow at the Stockholm Environment Institute in Bangkok.

""City authorities should recognize wetlands as an important resource to be protected and integrated into the urban environment,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""Yet in many cities, expansion takes place without the necessary enforcement of urban planning or in-depth environmental impact assessments,"" she said.

Across rapidly expanding Asian cities, demand for land for housing and office blocks has put greater pressure over land.

Cambodia has endorsed the international convention on wetlands protection, yet about half its wetlands have disappeared over the last 15 years, according to conservation group Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT).

In Phnom Penh, 15 of 25 lakes have been infilled, with about a third of the Tompoun wetland infilled so far, STT said.

Dredging the more than 100 million tonnes of sand needed for infilling poses added risks to communities and the environment, said Eang Vuthy, executive director of Equitable Cambodia.

""Given that millions will be affected, in-depth studies and public consultations are needed,"" he said.

A spokesman for the government said the reclamation was necessary for the city's development, and that an environment impact assessment had been done.

""A canal is being built to divert excess water, and there is a wastewater treatment plant. Some relocations are necessary, but they have been given ample time to move,"" said Phay Siphan.

In Phnom Penh, nearly 4,000 families were evicted in 2007-08 from their homes around Boeung Kak - ""boeung"" is lake in Khmer - as it was filled in for a business district.

Authorities must now prioritize public interest, said Vuthy.

""A balanced model that protects the rights of people and the environment with urban development is possible, but only with meaningful consultation and research,"" he said.","Mon, 27 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/07/27/2020_07_27_101085_1595832242._large.jpg,"['phnom', 'families', 'destroyed', 'urban', 'environment', 'risk', 'necessary', 'penh', 'flood', 'water', 'wetlands', 'million', 'rights']",

The Yangtze River basin in the southern part of China has been hard hit by heavy flooding since early June this year. Hundreds of the basin's small to medium-size rivers, as well as major lakes including the Dongting, Poyang and Tai, have risen to their highest levels in history.

This flooding is certainly not the first of its kind: the Yangtze River basin experiences large floods about every 10 years, each causing suffering and extreme damage to the economy and environment. Human and ecological factors like accelerating urbanization make them worse.

So the most immediate question is: what can be done to reduce the likelihood of flood-related losses while maximizing the benefits of economic development? The solution is a complex tangle of financial, institutional, social, procedural and technical threads.

First, rehabilitating aging flood-control measures such as dikes and reservoirs is paramount. More than 80,000 reservoirs in China, of which about 50,000 are in the Yangtze River basin, do not store water up to the intended level as they are subject to leakage, instability of dams and inadequate drainage capacity for emergency flood discharge. Rehabilitation of such reservoirs is a lower-cost way to strengthen flood mitigation and with less adverse impact on the environment and people than building new reservoirs.

Rural areas also tend to lack flood risk mitigation standards in China compared to urban areas. Nature-based approaches, such as ecological embankments, protecting wetlands and restoring the ecosystem to mitigate flood damage will be essential.

Second, ecological conservation will play a crucial role in mitigating floods. A large number of wetlands in China that formerly served as natural flood barriers have been destroyed at the annual rate of about 9% since the 1950s.

About 1.3 million hectares of water surface areas and buffer zones mainly in the Dongting, Poyang and Tai lakes have been reclaimed for agriculture or urban development, and the remaining volume of lakes is reduced significantly due to sedimentation. The government has started restoring these lost wetlands, but it requires time and significant amount of finance and commitment.

Third, responsibilities for flood risk management are still divided among several agencies despite recent institutional reform in China. The role of river-basin authorities needs to be enhanced to fully enable their coordination.

Fourth, social and gender inequalities need to be addressed. Poverty is both a cause and a consequence of vulnerability, especially in rural areas, where households rely primarily on agriculture for their livelihoods. Many emerging farmers, who built up assets on newly consolidated land for agriculture, are dragged into severe poverty by the floods.

In areas with inadequate access to sanitation, floods can lead to toilet overflow, groundwater contamination, soil pollution and general environmental degradation. Increasing access to safely managed sanitation and improving public health conditions is therefore paramount to protect both human and environmental health. This is particularly relevant to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in highly exposed communities.

A participatory and community-based approach to flood risk management should be in place to reduce the vulnerability and increase the resilience of local communities. The flood early-warning system should be well embedded into the community-based system.

Fifth, financial mechanisms are instrumental in mitigating the impacts of monetary losses. The potential of financial products, including insurance and resilience bonds, contingent liability facilities, risk pooling and other emerging mechanisms for adapting planning and ecosystem resilience, is still largely untapped. The Chinese government, international financial institutions, the private sector, commercial banks, research institutes and civil society organizations have to work closely together.

Taking all these elements into account, the Asian Development Bank has invested about $2 billion to support the Yangtze River Economic Belt program to address environmental, social and economic issues. This moves beyond traditional watershed management toward a comprehensive approach that embraces all aspects of the basin, including protection of public goods, such as water resources, ecosystems, pollution control, biodiversity conservation and climate change.

To build back better, protect and restore the ecosystem services on which China's economic growth and jobs depend, a nature-centered approach will be pivotal. As a positive step, a national green development fund with total registered capital of $12.7 billion, focusing on key areas of green development along the Yangtze River Economic Belt, was established in Shanghai on July 15.

The funds raised will be directed to investment fields such as pollution control, ecological restoration, afforestation of national land, conservation of energy and resources, green transportation and clean energy along the Yangtze river.

Together with the promulgation of a Yangtze river protection law and the establishment of a green development fund, all these actions to manage and value natural ecosystems can address societal challenges and extreme events effectively and adaptively, while providing economic dividends, human well-being and biodiversity benefits.","Wed, 22 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F4%252F4%252F1%252F3%252F28363144-1-eng-GB%252FA20200721%2520Poyang%2520Lake.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['worse', 'prevent', 'development', 'areas', 'green', 'china', 'basin', 'economic', 'risk', 'yangtze', 'getting', 'flood', 'floods', 'river', 'act']", 
12,12,FF-2020-000170-IDN,Indonesian Red Cross welcomes progress on government and PfR road map for addressing land subsidence - Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre,https://www.climatecentre.org/news/1308/indonesian-red-cross-welcomes-progress-on-government-and-pfr-road-map-for-addressing-land-subsidence,"Indonesian Red Cross welcomes progress on government and PfR road map for addressing land subsidence

Further progress has been made in discussions involving Indonesia’s Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investment Affairs, several other ministries and government agencies, Partners for Resilience, and civil society bodies on a long-term plan for work aimed at strengthening policy, law and investment to prevent land subsidence, especially due to the extraction of ground water.



In a series of meetings in May and last month, initiatives were identified under a road map on subsidence launched last September, including the establishment of monitoring stations, studies of the impact on vulnerable cities of the extraction of ground water, improved management of water resources, and flood preparedness.



The road map is seen as timely since a number of cities on the north coast of Java and peaty areas of Sumatra and Kalimantan islands areas are effectively sinking; other coastal areas, including Jakarta, are regularly flooded by seawater at high tides.



The Indonesian capital, home to some 10 million people, has been described as “one of the fastest-sinking cities in the world”, partly due to excessive extraction of ground water for domestic and industrial use.



Work began on the road map in early 2018, involving the government, PfR agencies Wetlands International Indonesia and the Climate Centre, and other CSOs.



Peaty areas



Preventing land subsidence in Indonesia involves an overall integrated approach, including measures such as increased investment in water supply, management of coastal zones, climate action, ecosystem management and restoration, and sustainable livelihoods.



At the national level in Indonesia, visions for sustainable development include improved river management and accessible clean water, and the integration of climate issues and risk reduction into spatial planning.



At the city level, road maps on land subsidence are being discussed in the capital of Central Java province, Semarang, and Pekalongan, its major port.



Sustainable management of peat land is promoted by Wetlands International in Indonesia, but PfR and other stakeholders have been involved in dialogue and programmes to reduce the permanent conversion of peaty areas for unsustainable farming in Kalimantan and Sumatra.



However in some areas unless subsidence is stopped the restoration of coastal mangrove and aquaculture may no longer be feasible.



As work continued on the road map in May and June, Java saw tidal floods on the coast that reached further than usual because of subsidence.



Investment



“PMI welcomes this road map on land subsidence and hopes that a comprehensive work plan can be implemented,” said said Arifin Hadi, Head of the Disaster Management Division at the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI).



“PMI works nationwide, including coastal areas that experience tidal floods known here as rob.



“This flooding is caused by a combination of sinking land surface, rising sea levels and higher waves.”



Subsidence even lowers the land in some areas below river or sea level, generating massive impact on coastal communities, wetlands and peat.



The road map was launched at an international conference on land subsidence, with Dr Heri Andreas, an expert from the Bandung Institute of Technology, as lead author.



One issue it identifies is the fact that efforts in many parts of the country are uncoordinated and isolated, lacking mainstreaming within an overall framework for investment.

Reserves are forecast to fall more than 10% from a month earlier to 3 million tons, according to the median estimate from five analysts and plantation executives compiled by Bloomberg. Production will drop 8.3% to 3.54 million tons from an estimated 3.86 million tons in June, the survey showed.

Floods at some plantations in Kalimantan and Sumatra have disrupted the palm fruit harvest, said Eddy Martono, director of planter PT Mega Karya Nusa. July is also usually a low production month and output is expected to start rising in September, he said. Benchmark prices on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives rose 1.6% and headed for the highest close since February.

Futures have climbed about about 17% this month. Fitch Solutions has raised its average price forecast for this year to 2,450 ringgit per ton from 2,300 ringgit previously. Import demand from India and China is expected to remain robust as the top buyers need to rebuild stocks, it said in a July 20 note.

Domestic consumption for July is seen rising slightly from a month earlier to 1.42 million tons as the mandatory 30% blending of biofuel with gasoil continues. Exports are seen increasing 4.8% to 2.42 million tons.

14,14,FF-2020-000170-IDN,China on highest flood alert as 38m people evacuated - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Natural-disasters/China-on-highest-flood-alert-as-38m-people-evacuated,"SHANGHAI -- Despite reassurances by the government, residents along China's rivers are increasingly worried that the mitigation capabilities of the Three Gorges Dam might fail after heavy rains lashed parts of the country.

Some 141 people are already missing or dead, and nearly 38 million people have been evacuated since alerts were triggered in June about the flooding of 433 rivers nationwide, the country's flood control authorities said on Monday.

President Xi Jinping is making the ""greatest effort"" in rescue and prevention directives, Xinhua state news agency reported Sunday. Xi was particularly concerned that the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake -- the country's longest river and biggest lake -- had risen above warning levels.

Authorities in Jiangxi, the province through which the Yangtze River flows and which is home to Poyang, raised its flood-control response to Level 1 on Sunday, the highest of a four-level emergency response.

Torrential rains that typically hit in July and August started in the middle of June this year. Video clips on social media showed rivers overflowing and submerging homes, including a three-story home in Jiangxi that collapsed and was swept away by strong currents on July 5.

Economic losses from damage to properties in 13 provinces had reached 25.7 billion yuan ($3.6 billion) by the end of June, according to an estimate by PingAn Securities. Continued flooding is expected to drag down investment in the third quarter but unlikely to affect economic output as a whole, it said.

Residents in affected areas appeared to be more concerned that the Three Gorges Dam would breach its banks with further downpours, even though authorities had released floodwater from the dam upstream on June 29.

In one video posted by a resident in Wuhan on Friday on the Toutiao Jinri news app, Yangtze River's water level reached 28.11 meters, well above the average, even though there had been no rain in the city in recent days. Wuhan is one of the cities in the Yangtze River basin, south of the Three Gorges dam.

Dam authorities tried to reassure residents by saying in state media on July 8 that the reservoir could still hold more rain as it had only reached 149 meters of a maximum of 175 meters that it can contain.

Like others, Zhang Jianping, an activist in Jiangsu, is skeptical.

""With hindsight, I think that all those experts who opposed the buildings of the Three Gorges were right,"" Zhang said on Radio Free Asia. ""Since it was built, it has never played a role in preventing flooding or droughts, like we thought it would back then.""

Despite protests by residents and environmentalists, the Three Gorges Dam was completed in 2006 after a 12-year build. Millions were displaced as an area of about 600 kilometers was submerged to create the world's largest dam and hydroelectricity facilities.","Mon, 13 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F2%252F8%252F9%252F9%252F28219982-3-eng-GB%252FCropped-159463230320200713%2520three%2520gorges%2520dam%2520AP20185268272100.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['reached', 'authorities', 'evacuated', 'dam', 'meters', 'residents', 'china', '38m', 'flooding', 'rivers', 'gorges', 'yangtze', 'alert', 'flood', 'river', 'highest']",

The country is already facing one of its worst floods since 1998 with water breaching record levels at key waterways and lakes.

""The inflow of the Three Gorges Dam on the upstream Yangtze River may reach 60,000 cubic meters per second on Tuesday,"" the Ministry of Water Resources said in a statement. ""Water at the Yangtze River midstream will rise again and exceed its limit by 0.2 meters."" The ministry also warned of a ""huge flood"" both east and west of the city of Yichang in Hubei Province where the dam is located.

The estimated inflow tracked the 61,000 cubic meters per second recorded on July 20, which raised the dam's water level to a record high of 164.2 meters.

Completed in 2006, Three Gorge Dam began receiving floodwater on July 2 at 53,000 cubic meters per second, raising the water level to 149 meters. The maximum level is 175 meters.

Floods have already displaced 46 million people in 27 of the country's 31 provinces since heavy rainfalls began in June, leaving 141 people dead or missing with economic losses of 116 billion yuan ($17 billion), according to the Ministry of Emergency Management.

Videos posted on Sunday by residents in the city of Enshi in Hubei showed main roads inundated in raging currents that swept away vehicles and properties. This followed earlier floods and landslides on July 17.

The central government urged ""greater efforts"" to mitigate floods.

""Efforts should be made to further increase flood discharge of the Huai River, reduce the water level of Hongze Lake, and prepare for heavy rains,"" said E Jingping, minister of water resources, on Sunday.

Nomura, in a research note on Monday, projected a 0.2 percentage point drop of third-quarter economic growth, and a higher inflation rate in July and August.

U.S. research company Jefferies said on July 21 that there had been no serious sales disruptions in the aftermath of the flood.","Mon, 27 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F6%252F3%252F0%252F6%252F28456036-6-eng-GB%252FCropped-1595829953jpp035222842.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['second', 'dam', 'cubic', 'meters', 'china', 'level', 'gorges', 'yangtze', 'ministry', 'water', 'floods', 'river', 'flood', 'pressure', 'warns']",

Ongoing weeklong monsoon rains caused severe flooding in low lying areas of Bangladesh.

According to the National Disaster Response Coordination Center (NDRCC), 18 districts of Northern, NorthEastern and South-Eastern Bangladesh are most affected. The flood situation is currently worsening in those districts where roads are cut off, leaving hundreds of thousands of people stranded. 2.4 million people are reportedly affected and over 548,000 families had their homes flooded or water-logged. Flood protection infrastructures such as embankments and dykes are already damaged. The COVID-19 pandemic context creates further challenges to disaster response and recovery efforts as measures such as physical distancing need to be observed in order to minimize the risk of infections among the affected people, especially those in emergency shelters.

On 13 July, flashfloods in North Luwu District, South Sulawesi resulted in the displacement of over 14,400 people. 38 people have been reported dead, 58 sustained injuries, and 38 people are currently missing. The floods affected over 4,200 houses, nine schools, and dozens of places of worship. Access to the affected areas is complicated due to damaged and flooded roads, which are currently being cleared with heavy equipment. The National Disaster Management Agency and Indonesian Air Force have mobilized aircrafts to support logistics and evacuation operations. Search and Rescue efforts are ongoing. Neighboring districts and provinces, the Indonesian Red Cross and members of the Humanitarian Forum Indonesia are supporting clean-up operations and are providing food packages, potable water, and NFIs.

Monsoon rains have resulted in flooding and landslides in several municipalities across the country.

As of 16 July, 101 people have been reported dead, 53 are missing and 96 have sustained various injuries. Rapid assessments have identified shelter, food and protection as key immediate needs.

Access remains the biggest challenge as many of the remote areas affected by landslides are only accessible with helicopters at present. Another key issue is the depletion of PPE supplies, in particular masks, and the need to ensure minimum availability of protective equipment for ‘frontline workers’. With further rains and flooding possible, the HCT is discussing monsoon preparedness and scaling up coordination via the respective provincial-level focal points.","Tue, 21 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1527791-ROAP_Snapshot_200721.png?itok=ov8_CH6h,"['bangladesh', 'regional', '14', '20', 'sustained', 'currently', 'roads', 'areas', 'rains', 'resulted', 'humanitarian', '2020', 'pacific', 'flooding', 'districts', 'affected', 'asia', 'disaster', 'snapshot', 'weekly']",

Governance, not government; policies not politics.","Mon, 20 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://aecnewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Indonesia-morning-news-29-20-700.jpg,"['2020', 'pandemic', 'indonesia', 'morning', 'national', 'antara', 'covid19', 'jakarta', 'cases', 'coronavirus', 'indonesian', '20', 'health']", 
18,18,FF-2020-000170-IDN,Climate change brings Japan more deadly downpours - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Natural-disasters/Climate-change-brings-Japan-more-deadly-downpours,"TOKYO -- The risk of deadly downpours has risen Japan in recent years due to global warming, adding to people's worries this summer, on top of the new coronavirus pandemic.

Heavy rains, floods and landslides this month have destroyed more than 1,000 residential buildings, killing at least 78 people across Japan, mostly in the country's southwestern Kumamoto Prefecture.

For the 24 hours through the morning of July 4, the city of Ashikita in northern Kumamoto was hit by torrential rain said to ""occur once in 50 or 100 years,"" according to the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience, or NIED. Some cities in the region got more than a month's worth of precipitation overnight.

Devastating rainfall and floods have become more common in recent years, highlighting the threat of climate change. Last year, typhoons in October triggered a deluge that would normally occur only once in ""over 100 years"" in parts of Nagano, Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures, according to NIED.

The island of Kyushu, hit hardest by this year's downpours, was soaked with flooding rains just three years earlier, leaving 42 people dead or missing. In July 2018, there was also widespread flooding in southern Japan.

Data from the Japan Meteorological Agency shows downpours are becoming more frequent. For the 10 years from 2010 to 2019, rainfall in excess of 50 mm an hour occurred 327 times a year on average, compared with 226 times between 1976 and 1985, an increase of 40%. Extreme rainfall events with precipitation of more than 400 mm per day -- the level likely to cause landslides or floods -- rose 170% over the same period.

The trend is likely to continue, as ""more global warming will lead to increased occurrences of heavy rain,"" said Fumiaki Fujibe, a professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University. Global warming is widely seen as increasing the frequency of heavy rain because temperatures put more water vapor into the atmosphere. According to the Meteorological Agency, the amount of water vapor over Japan has been rising since at least 1980.

On the other hand, research led by Hiroaki Kawase of the Meteorological Research Institute, the agency's research branch, suggests global warming may not be the direct cause of the torrential rains, despite causing heavier rainfall. His research shows that the precipitation level during Japan's heavy rainfall in July 2018 was 6.5% higher than it would have been absent the temperature rise of the last 40 years, given the same atmospheric pressure and wind patterns.

Japan, of course, is not the only country at risk of flooding. Destructive floods have occurred in Asia almost every year. In 2016, floods in China led to 310 deaths and $14 billion in economic losses, according to the World Meteorological Organization.

In 2017, floods across India, Bangladesh and Nepal killed at least 1,200 people. The organization also warned in July that ""unusually heavy monsoon rainfall and flooding is affecting India and neighboring South Asian countries, as well as China and Japan.""

The COVID-19 pandemic adds an additional challenge this year. In the case of the Kyushu downpours this month, there was a shortages of capacity at evacuation centers. On top of the difficulty of finding safe places for people to stay, social-distancing requirements limited the amount of available space.

In Kumamoto Prefecture, a staff member who worked at two evacuation sites tested positive for COVID-19. As many as 400 people may have come into contact with the contact with the worker, requiring people to undergo PCR testing and that the sites be disinfected.","Sun, 26 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F2%252F1%252F6%252F0%252F28360612-1-eng-GB%252FRTS3IGJ2.JPG?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['meteorological', 'deadly', 'floods', 'change', 'climate', 'japan', 'research', 'flooding', 'warming', 'downpours', 'rainfall', 'brings', 'global', 'heavy']", 
19,19,FF-2020-000170-IDN,Anxiety grows as water level in Three Gorges Dam increases - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Natural-disasters/Anxiety-grows-as-water-level-in-Three-Gorges-Dam-increases,"SHANGHAI -- The relentless rains pummeling central and southern China have lifted water levels at the Three Gorges Dam, fueling concerns of much wider flood damage.

One of the world's largest, the Three Gorges Dam in Hubei Province is now holding back water from the Yangtze River, China's longest, at a level topping 162 meters as of Tuesday afternoon. The dam was built to hold 145 meters of water.

Because of heavy downpours since June, authorities have allowed dam to hold more water to prevent flooding downstream. The dam started pumping out excess water at the end of June in an attempt to control the volume.

The dam initially pumped out 30,000 cu. meters of water per second. The rate was cut to less than 20,000 cu. meters per second in mid-July.

But the heavy rain continued unabated, and the inflow of floodwater to the Three Gorges Dam amounted to 61,000 cubic meters per second on Saturday, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency.

Over 400 rivers have experienced flooding, affecting 24 million people this month with authorities estimating the economic toll at 64.4 billion yuan ($9.2 billion). Wuhan, where the novel coronavirus originated, was among the areas inundated by floodwater.

The Ministry of Water Resources has said all dams along the Yangtze River are being safely supervised, citing the 30,000 monitoring stations along the river and the network of adjustable flood control pumps. But there has been speculation in Chinese media over whether the dams will be breached if the heavy rain continues.

The water ministry expects downpours to continue through Thursday, according to media reports. The National Meteorological Center has advised the affected areas to remain on alert.

Honda Motor operates three plants in Wuhan. The facilities were responsible for half the 1.37 million vehicles the Japanese automaker manufactured in China in fiscal 2019.

""At this point, there are no reports of any impact, including at dealerships,"" said a Honda representative. But in the case of severe flooding, the blow to Honda's Chinese business would be significant.

Japanese tire maker Bridgestone operates an automotive seat pad plant in Wuhan. As of Wednesday afternoon, ""there has been no impact on facilities and the supply chain for material has not ceased,"" said a Bridgestone spokesperson.

No damage has been reported at Isuzu Motors' truck and engine factories in Chongquing, a metropolis on the Yangtze River. The same goes for Mazda Motor's facility in the city of Nanjing, also located along the river.

The companies were forced to shut down their plants temporarily this spring due to the novel coronavirus outbreak. The factories started to restore normal capacity in April, and China is the sole market in which operations have recovered to pre-pandemic levels. The floodwaters risk reversing those gains.","Thu, 23 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F9%252F7%252F5%252F0%252F28390579-5-eng-GB%252FCropped-1595439071photo.JPG?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['second', 'anxiety', 'dam', 'meters', 'increases', 'level', 'flooding', 'gorges', 'yangtze', 'grows', 'water', 'river', 'heavy', 'wuhan']", 
20,20,FF-2020-000170-IDN,Red Cross urges Indonesians to change behavior to prevent COVID-19 spiralling out of control - Indonesia - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/indonesia/red-cross-urges-indonesians-change-behavior-prevent-covid-19-spiralling-out-control,"Jakarta/Kuala Lumpur, 27 July 2020 – Indonesian Red Cross is urging all Indonesians to continue practising physical distancing and to exercise greater caution to prevent COVID-19 infections from spiralling out of control as the country adapts to a `new normal’.

COVID-19 cases continue to climb rapidly in Indonesia, with more than 1000 new cases being diagnosed every day over the past three weeks, with a record high of over 2,600 people infected by coronavirus. The country is the hardest hit in South East Asia, with more than 91,751 cases and at least 4,459 deaths, according to the John Hopkins University COVID-19 database.

In response to this surge in cases, Red Cross is actively sending stronger public messaging through awareness campaigns, to contain the spread of the virus, especially as restrictions start to ease in much of the country. In what has been called the “new normal”, offices, schools, places of worship, malls, markets, and tourist attractions are reopening in some regions as four months of large-scale social restrictions are lifted.

Indonesian Red Cross Secretary General Sudirman Said: “Transmissions will continue to rise unless communities adapt their daily lives by applying strict health protocols during this new normal phase.”

“We are intensifying our efforts to educate the public about the importance of changing their behaviour for good by physical distancing, wearing masks and practising good hygiene. We are mobilizing our thousands of brave volunteers to work directly and safely with communities while reaching out on social media and across radio airwaves and loudspeakers.

“These times are tough, but people are staying strong. The challenge is to effectively reach all our diverse communities living on 6,000 inhabited islands. This calls for a unified, unprecedented, large scale effort to reach all parts of society, in every corner of our country.”

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Indonesian Red Cross is mobilising around 7,000 volunteers to provide important health services to 1.5 million people. Volunteers have also carried out health promotion activities for more than five million people focusing on eight priority provinces which have the highest COVID-19 cases in the country, which is the fourth most populous in the world.

This effort has been backed by the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC), which launched a global appeal to provide support to the world’s most at risk countries, including Indonesia.

Jan Gelfand, Head of Indonesia Country Office, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Society said: “This global pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge, requiring global cooperation but a local response. As cases rise in Indonesia, Red Cross is doubling its efforts, using all available resources to slow the spread of this virus. Red Cross recognises that individuals and communities have a critical role to play, by changing their behaviour, they can help to control COVID in this new normal.”

Heavy rain is expected in Sichuan and Anhui in China's central regions over the next few days before heading north towards the capital Beijing, according to the National Meteorology Center.

The Yangtze, China's longest river, flows through the central regions of the country, where the Three Gorges Dam is also located. Some residents there have raised concerns recently over the dam's capacity to cope with the extra amounts of water.

Videos posted on social media showed many areas in Wuhan, one of the cities in the Yangtze River basin downstream of the dam and which has lately become known for being the initial epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, were still flooded as authorities rushed to reinforce dykes. Water levels in the city were recorded at 28.47 meters on Wednesday, above the warning level of 27.50 meters.

Since June, average rainfall nationwide was 172.7 mm, or 12% more than the same period last year. China saw some serious flood-led disasters centered around the Yangtze River in 1998 and 2016. Authorities said on Wednesday the rain record in the river basin since the start of the monsoon season last month reached 600 mm, higher than 2016's level of 580 mm but still below the 700 mm recorded in 1998.

Even so, floods around districts near the country's largest lake, Poyang in Jiangsi Province, have worsened in recent days, prompting the rescue of 6.4 million people, officials said on Wednesday. This is in addition to the 38 million people who have been evacuated across the country, which was announced on Monday.

As rains are predicted to move north, authorities in Xiongan New Area and Baoding, south of Beijing, are strengthening flood control measures, state media Xinhua reported on Monday.

Xiongan is one of the key economic development regions promoted by the government of President Xi Jinping. It is also the location of Daxing International Airport, Beijing's latest travel gateway.

Economists have raised concerns over the impact of the floods on the country's economic recovery, projecting there will be a drag on investment activities in the current quarter.

The government is expected to announce economic data for the April to June quarter on Thursday, with many analysts pointing to growth after a contraction of 6.8% in the first quarter.","Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F3%252F8%252F1%252F1%252F28261183-3-eng-GB%252FCropped-159480846520200715%2520china%2520flood%2520AP20197169936095.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['warning', 'stays', 'mm', 'authorities', 'china', 'basin', 'economic', 'country', 'yangtze', 'regions', 'river', 'floods', 'levels', 'warns', 'days']",

Parts of the eastern coast, including the Bohai Bay region, Shandong and the province of Jiangsu also face hurricane-force winds, the China Meteorological Administration said.

The port cities of Qingdao and Rizhao on the eastern coast were the latest to see record-breaking daily rainfall on Wednesday, and the provinces of Jiangxi and Anhui on the Yangtze river issued new red alerts early on Thursday.

The Ministry of Water Resources said 93 rivers remained above warning levels, adding that the Three Gorges reservoir, China's biggest, will need to be closely monitored as incoming floodwaters surge.

""The current flood control situation remains severe and cannot be relaxed in any way,"" it said.

Regions throughout China have been ordering emergency evacuations as a result of landslides, burst riverbanks and mountain floods.

China has vowed to take a scientific approach to controlling floods and has made use of early warning systems as well as its dams and reservoirs to try to minimise the damage.

More than 45 million people have been affected since flood season began in June, with 142 people dead or missing, but the figure is lower than usual, state news agency Xinhua said on Wednesday. Direct economic damage, at just over 160 billion yuan ($22.84 billion), was also lower than the five-year average.

However, experts say the heaviest rainfall in decades has exposed the country's overreliance on giant feats of engineering like the Three Gorges Dam, to regulate and utilise its water supplies.

Water levels at major rivers were rising on Tuesday at around two dozen points in 20 districts.

Many new areas in northern, northeastern and central Bangladesh have been affected over the last 24 hours, said an executive engineer with the Water Development Board.

Extremely heavy rain across the border in upstream India and Bangladesh triggered the second wave of flooding while the first wave has not yet receded.

Jakarta, July 16, 2020 – The global economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has hit Indonesia. Indonesia’s economic growth is projected to fall to zero percent in 2020, as weary consumers and mobility restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the virus have led to a freeze in tourism, low commodity prices, and empty shops and restaurants. Recovery will be gradual, and real GDP growth is projected to reach 4.8 percent in 2021, only bouncing back to 6.0 percent in 2022, according to the World Bank’s July 2020 Indonesia Economic Prospects report, released today.

The impact on livelihoods has also been severe, with most Indonesians experiencing income losses. Without a significant expansion of social assistance, as many as 5.5 million Indonesians could have been pushed into poverty because of the Covid-19 shock.

To respond to the crisis, the Indonesian Government has announced a fiscal package amounting to 4.3 percent of GDP. The package includes funds to improve the preparedness of the health sector and a substantial increase in social assistance. If fully disbursed and well-targeted, the stimulus package could go a long way to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on poverty, according to the report.

“*We welcome the robust response of the Government of Indonesia to mitigate the impacts of this unprecedented crisis. It is essential that the package is now effectively implemented to have the fullest impact on the people and the economy*,” said Satu Kahkonen, World Bank Country Director for Indonesia and Timor-Leste. “*We are also encouraged that the Government is keen to turn this crisis into an opportunity by advancing important reforms to boost competitiveness, which will lay a strong foundation for a more robust recovery*.”

This July 2020 edition of the Indonesia Economic Prospects report also outlines strategies to help the country build back better from the crisis, including by building on the expansion of the pandemic-driven expansion of social protection coverage and closing newly identified gaps in the system, and accelerating the delivery of universal health care for all.

“*To effectively curb the impact of the pandemic, the government’s decision to shift spending priorities and increase the budget deficit was absolutely necessary,*” said Frederico Gil Sander, World Bank Lead Economist for Indonesia. “*Going forward, higher spending on health, social protection and infrastructure will still be needed, which makes tax reforms to raise fiscal revenues of paramount importance to flatten the debt curve and maintain Indonesia’s strong macroeconomic framework*.”

The Indonesia Economic Prospects report is supported by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Heavy flooding is worsening in parts of Bangladesh, with over 1 million villagers marooned or leaving their homes for higher ground along with their cattle and other belongings, officials and volunteers said Tuesday.

Water levels at major rivers were rising Tuesday at around two dozen points in 20 districts. Many new areas in northern, northeastern and central Bangladesh have been affected over last 24 hours, Arifuzzman Bhuiyan, an executive engineer with the Water Development Board, said by phone. Bangladesh has 64 districts.

“The situation is worsening,” he said. “The worst thing is that the floods are getting prolonged this year, which is a bad sign.”

Bhuiyan said heavy rainfall and rushing waters from upstream India were the main reasons for the floods in the delta nation of 160 million people, which receives monsoon rains between June and October every year, often leading to flooding.

The floods started late last month, and after briefly easing continued to worsen, affecting many new areas, destroying crops and driving people from their homes in several impoverished regions. Bangladesh is crisscrossed by 230 rivers, including 53 shared with India.

In the northern district of Kurigram, one of the worst-hit areas, thousands of villagers have moved from their homes to higher ground since the weekend, bringing along their cattle and other belongings, said Mizanur Rahman Soikat, project co-ordinator with the Bidyanondo Foundation, a local charity. The foundation has been distributing both cooked and dry food to the flood-affected villagers, many of whom have lost their crops and livelihood.

Soikat said that over the last few weeks, the charity has distributed food to some 135,000 people in Kurigram, while the government’s relief office was also providing food, cash and cattle food.

“Over last two days, the situation has deteriorated and many villages went underwater in the district,” he said by phone. “I have seen thousands taking shelter.”

About 36 people are reported to have died after torrential rain triggered flash floods and urban flooding in Pakistan.

An emergency has been imposed at hospitals across Karachi, where paramilitary forces are helping traffic police in rescuing commuters amid traffic jams, flooding of roads and destruction of infrastructure.

“We were stuck in homes this Sunday as people shared videos of motorcycles and even cars being swept away in strong floods. Several people were injured by tiles falling from high buildings,” Mansha Noor, executive secretary of Caritas Pakistan Karachi, told UCA News.

“The frontline volunteers of our disaster management committees (DMCs) continued rescue efforts during heavy rains and helped in saving people and their belongings in low-lying areas.”

Father James Shamaun parish priest of St. Thomas Catholic Church in Wah Cantonment, a military city in Punjab province, shared the devastation in a Facebook Live video recorded on July 25. The priest described visiting a flooded church in Taxila, another city of the Diocese of Islamabad-Rawalpindi.

“The river is flooded. We pray here every Sunday evening. We cannot reach there in this situation. We shall pray here depending on the weather,” he said. The clip has been viewed more than 3,300 times.

Meanwhile, Caritas is developing a response plan for a flood emergency this year. The charity has inspired DMCs in all six dioceses and the apostolic prefecture, empowering disaster-prone communities to help themselves.

Amjad Gulzar, executive director of Caritas Pakistan, said the floods will worsen livelihood challenges amid the coronavirus pandemic.

“Covid-19 has changed the scenario of country. Rain-related damages have added to the losses of the poor and daily wagers struggling amid the lockdown,"" he said.

“DMCs have been especially instructed to observe social distancing and SOPs [standard operating procedures] in rescue and relief efforts. Our response plan includes food kits, hygiene kits, shelter and non-food items.”

Selangor state local government, public transportation and new village development committee chairman Ng Sze Han said the project began last year but was temporarily put on hold due to the movement control order.

Work resumed at the end of last month.

The first phase of the project, he said, was to improve the water catchment area at Jalan Kenari 1 where water flowing from Puchong Jaya collects.

For the second phase, an underground culvert would divert water to the mining pond behind the shopping centre.

Ng visited the project site following Wednesday’s flash floods at the Damansara-Puchong Expressway (LDP) near the mall.

With him were representatives of Subang Jaya Municipal Council (MPSJ) and Lingkaran Trans Kota Sdn Bhd (Litrak), which manages the LDP.

There was a traffic jam on the LDP following Wednesday’s flash floods.



“The project is estimated to cost RM4mil and it will be borne by MPSJ, Litrak and IOI, ” said Ng.

He said the downpour at about 3.30pm on Wednesday lasted only 30 minutes but 81mm of rainwater was recorded.

Several areas in Puchong and Kinrara were affected such as a residential area in Batu 13 as well as several sections along the LDP.

“The floodwaters receded quickly. The most affected areas were from IOI Mall to Bandar Puteri Puchong, ” he said.","Fri, 24 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/07/24/792677.jpg,"['mpsj', 'rm4mil', 'ioi', 'phase', 'flash', 'puchong', 'project', 'end', 'works', 'water', 'wednesdays', 'mitigation', 'near']",

The group, mostly women and children, had been housed at a temporary shelter, following their disembarkation on 24 June, after being stranded at sea for over 120 days.

Watch video

IOM – working in close coordination with local authorities – organized three buses and two trucks to ferry the group and their meager belongings plus all the items that they have received from various entities since they landed. Coordinated preparations went into ensuring that by the time the group arrived, all the appropriate facilities were in place.

Prior to the group’s departure from the temporary shelter, IOM provided a comprehensive pre-departure briefing, while also reminding the group of strict COVID-19 protocols for their safety.

A 32-year-old man expressed his and the group’s gratitude, saying, “We are now in a shelter on the land. Now, no fear of sudden death, which we always felt in the boat. Getting food and treatment here. I feel very happy to see IOM people here every day in the shelter. We are grateful to be on the land.”

“We were shifted to this new place so it may take few days to understand everything here, but I am happy for the food and specially my treatment arranged by IOM in the hospital. I am optimistic about a better life in coming days,” said a 45-year-old woman.

“I am happy to be here. We are getting food regularly, accommodation is fine. We are happy for the goods we have received from IOM and others,” added a 23-year-old woman.

The group wore masks and practiced physical distancing during the journey, being mindful of several COVID-19 related trainings that IOM had imparted to them in the past weeks, along with the local health department.

Louis Hoffmann, IOM Chief of Mission in Indonesia, commended the round-the-clock efforts of the Government, as well as his team and partners on the ground. “We work closely with the national refugee task force and are pleased to be doing the same at the local level. This ensures local leadership, and an integrated, multi-sectoral response that will take into account the needs of the new arrivals, as well as the community. Here, we welcome the coordination role of the local task force, which provides all stakeholders the necessary coordination forums to organize activities and avoid duplication of efforts in meeting everyone’s needs.”

He added that IOM has been actively involved in all the clusters that have been established to coordinate the response, from shelter, food and nutrition to health, water, sanitation and hygiene. Notably the IOM medical team has established a referral system on the ground, to ensure that health needs beyond primary care are also being met.

Once the group settled in at the new shelter, IOM teams distributed hygiene kits tailored to the different needs of the children, women and men in the group.

IOM water tanks and wash stands previously provided at the temporary shelter were also transferred to the new shelter, so that the group and anyone entering the facility can take necessary precautions required of the health pandemic, and help safeguard the wellbeing of the group.

In the last few days at the temporary shelter, the group had been trained to properly sanitize and wash their hands regularly, with special sessions taking place for children in the form of storytelling and puppet shows conducted by IOM and local NGO Rumah Zakat.

Watch video

IOM has also supported the International Committee of the Red Cross in the essential activity of restoring family links for the group. Once family members are located, the group is given the opportunity to call their family back home and let them know that they are well and safe.

After four months and 10 days at sea, such connections are essential to the mental wellbeing of the group and their families back home. In addition, IOM has been facilitating necessary information sharing with the group, and also organized professional counseling for those who needed specialized care and attention.

IOM-provided interpretation continues to provide a critical communication bridge between the group, the government and key stakeholders, as the new arrivals adjust to their surroundings, and needs and access points for services are identified.

While this vulnerable group are being well looked after, concerns remain about others who may be stranded at sea, after taking to boats during the spring season in search of safety and protection.

IOM’s emergency response to support the Rohingya in Aceh is funded by the European Union Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO).

Indonesia has set up a new COVID-19 Handling and National Economic Recovery Committee to improve coordination and execution of the national COVID-19 response. The Committee merges the original COVID-19 Task Force helmed by Head of the National Disaster Management Agency Doni Monardo with the National Economic Recovery Task Force led by Coordinating Economic Affairs Minister Airlangga Hartarto.

The new structure will help to improve policy coordination between ministries and reduce the likelihood of conflicting ministerial regulations being promulgated. First, a ministerial policy committee led by Hartarto will integrate and determine the country’s strategic policy. Second, Minister of State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) Erick Thohir, concurrently the executive chairman in the new structure, will coordinate policy implementation carried out by the renamed COVID-19 Handling Task Force and the National Economic Recovery and Transformation Task Force.

A clear economic bias is evident in the new structure, with three out of four key leadership positions on the committee led by economic ministers, suggesting that Indonesia has decisively shifted policy attention toward facilitating an economic recovery.

Thus far, the central government’s rollout of health care and social assistance to mitigate the pandemic has been underwhelming, leading President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo to issue a stinging rebuke against some of his cabinet ministers in late June.

There has also been a litany of bad economic news. Minister of Manpower Ida Fauziah recently announced that 3 million people has lost employment as a result of the pandemic, bringing the official unemployment figure to around 10 million. The knock-on impact on the informal sector is probably far greater — Ridwan Kamil, the governor for West Java, highlighted that demand for government social assistance in West Java has skyrocketed from 9 million to 38 million (out of the West Java population of 50 million).

The new structure puts Thohir and Indonesia’s SOEs at the forefront of the economic recovery effort. The minister has been widely credited for his efforts to overhaul the SOE’s troubled corporate governance, and opinion surveys indicate that he is the most well-liked minister by the Indonesian public.

One of his first high-profile actions after his ministerial appointment was to fire the ex-president director of Garuda Indonesia for his involvement in smuggling a Harvey Davidson motorcycle aboard a Garuda plane. Since then, Thohir has worked to restructure, dissolve, or merge SOEs into 12 industry clusters in a bid to rationalize and restore SOEs to profitability. By making the SOE minister the executive chairman of the new COVID-19 response, Jokowi is relying on Thohir’s track record as a trouble-shooter to harmonize potentially competing health and economic interests in policy implementation.

The appointment of the SOE Vice Minister Budi Gunadi to lead the National Economic Transformation and Recovery Task Force also highlights the Indonesian government’s continued reliance on SOEs for policy intervention. For instance, the state-owned Bank Negara Indonesia is channeling credit assistance to micro, small, and medium enterprises through partnership with Grab. Additionally, Bio Farma, Indonesia’s pharmaceutical holding company, will play a key role in domestic efforts to manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine.

Prior to COVID-19, Jokowi looked set to double down on a pro-growth agenda to build infrastructure, invest in human capital, and pass structural reforms to increase private investment and accelerate Indonesia’s economic growth. The follow-through on those ambitions has been stalled as a result of COVID-19.

The Indonesian government has rightly focused policy attention on tackling three major upcoming challenges. Public health care in Indonesia must be prepared for an extended battle against COVID-19, especially with the worsening of the pandemic situation in Jakarta and East Java. At the same time, the central government is concerned about drought and food shortages arising from a climatic anomaly, where about 15 provinces will face drier weather than usual. Natural disasters are also a perennial problem, including the risk of forest fires, floods, and other disaster risks.

Funding constraints mean that infrastructure projects, such as the new capital relocation, will likely be affected, while the omnibus bill on job creation, a major economic reform package targeted at reducing regulatory bloat and simplifying licensing requirements, remains mired in controversy. A recent nationwide survey on the omnibus bill indicates that only 26 percent of respondents are aware of the bill, and the latest protests in front of the Parliament building suggests that building national consensus on the bill remains an uphill struggle.

Nonetheless, the new National Economic Recovery and Transformation Task Force indicates that the economic development agenda remains a key administration priority. Indonesia has persisted in efforts to import foreign expertise to support industrial activity, such as skilled Chinese workers for lithium battery production, and has indeed pulled out all the stops to attract factories seeking to relocate out of China. Many infrastructure projects across Indonesia are also still ongoing, highlighting that the administration is looking for an opportunity to return to its economic agenda.

The downside risks remain high. COVID-19 cases are still far from the peak in Indonesia, and the growing unemployment figures and budget deficits will likely impede efforts to promote economic recovery. The government first urgently needs to bring the virus situation under control and effectively roll out existing assistance schemes to help both the public health sector and ordinary Indonesians. If that can be accomplished, it will be possible for Indonesia to pull off a credible economic recovery program in late 2020 and 2021.

Media reports say as much as one meter of rain hit the city. Residents posted video and pictures to social media showing submerged cars and streets that looked like raging rivers.

Italian news agency ANSA reports firefighters worked all night searching for missing people in a flooded highway underpass. The intense rainfall sent streams of mud and water sweeping away cars and leaving them blocked in the underpass. Some drivers and passengers left their vehicles and swam to safety, but a witness reported seeing two people disappear in the roiling water.

On 19 July, the Minister of National Development Planning and Head of BAPPENAS announced that so far, only 113 districts / cities (22 percent out of 514 districts / cities in Indonesia) had updated their data on recipients of social assistance.

More than one million people have been marooned in Nepal, Bangladesh and India and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes for higher ground.

Indian officials said floods and mudslides killed 16 more people in the country's northeast, raising the death toll in the country to 93.

Nepal reported at least 117 deaths over the past month and Bangladesh reported three.

Rains caused the Brahmaputra River, which flows through Tibet, India and Bangladesh, to burst its banks in India's Assam state late last month, inundating large swathes of the state, triggering mudslides and displacing about 3.6 million people, officials said.

Vast tracts are still underwater, with 26 of the state's 33 districts badly affected.

Authorities rescued about 4,000 people trapped by the surging flood waters in various parts of Assam, said M.S. Mannivanan, chief of the state Disaster Management Authority. About 36,000 people whose homes were destroyed or submerged have taken shelter in nearly 300 government-run relief camps, he said.

The floods also inundated most of India's Kaziranga National Park, home to an estimated 2,500 rare one-horned rhinos, authorities said.

In the eastern state of Bihar, at least nine rivers swollen by heavy downpours in Nepal rose beyond their danger levels and inundated many villages.

One of them, the Gandak River, swept away the connecting roads of a newly built multimillion dollar bridge in Bihar's Gopalganj district, disrupting transportation in the area.

The Meteorological Center in the state capital, Patna, forecast heavy rain over the next 48 hours.

Nepal's Home Ministry said 117 people have died in the Himalayan nation in monsoon-related incidents. It said the rains triggered landslides in mountainous areas and flooding in the southern plains.

At least 47 people were reported missing and 126 have been injured in the past month, it said.

In Bangladesh, the Ministry of Disaster and Relief said at least three people have died and more than one million people have been marooned since floods hit the country late last month.

Officials said heavy rainfall and the onrush of river waters from upstream India were creating havoc in Bangladesh, a delta nation of 160 million people that is crisscrossed by 230 rivers.

Bangladesh's Flood Forecasting and Warning Center said Thursday that flooding could worsen at the beginning of next week because of growing devastation in the vast region along the Brahmaputra and Teesta rivers.

It said the situation would remain unstable over the next two weeks, causing further suffering for affected people.

Annual monsoon rains hit the region in June-September. The rains are crucial for rain-fed crops planted during the season but often cause extensive damage.","Thu, 16 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://loopnewslive.blob.core.windows.net/liveimage/sites/default/files/2020-07/YDdNLRNlKq.jpg,"['kill', 'asia', 'watch', 'landslides', 'state', 'bangladesh', 'rains', 'month', 'south', '213', 'past', 'river', 'floods', 'heavy', 'million', 'reported']",

China’s Xi calls for much stronger flood measures

Chinese President Xi Jinping called on Friday for much stronger measures in flood prevention and rescue work and urged relevant departments to give priority to the safety of people’s lives and property.

Xi, who is also secretary-general of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made his remarks while presiding over a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.

Xi stressed that flood prevention and rescue work matter to the safety of people’s lives and property, food security, economic security, social stability and State security.

As the nation will secure victory in the building of a moderately prosperous society and shaking off absolute poverty at the end of this year, Xi said it is critically important to do a good job in flood prevention and rescue work.

Since the floods hit southern China in June, relevant local Party committees, government departments as well as the People’s Liberation Army and armed troops have coordinated their efforts in flood relief and rescue work, and have achieved positive results, he said.

Xi urged authorities to shoulder their responsibilities for flood prevention and control work, strengthen coordination and synergies in anti-flood efforts, take more effective measures, do solid work in monitoring and early warning, prepare well for contingency plans, materials and human resources for flood prevention and put them in place in advance.

Participants of the meeting underlined the need to intensify coordination between different areas, leverage the strength of professional agencies and build up synergies among various provinces, departments and military and civilian forces, a news release issued after the meeting said.

Party committees and governments at all levels should take responsibility and go to the frontline to guide flood control work, it said.

The meeting also underlined the importance of improving the level of precise early warnings, particularly for heavy rainfall, typhoons, torrential floods and mudslides, and pre-warning information should be released in a timely way to villages, households and individuals, it added.

While engaging in flood control and disaster relief efforts, it said, authorities should at the same time carefully plan reconstruction to restore production and help people return to their normal lives as soon as possible.

Serious efforts must be made to assist poor, flood-affected residents so that they do not fall back into poverty because of a disaster, it said.

The participants also stressed the need to improve the country’s disaster prevention capacity, strengthen weaknesses in key infrastructure construction and build up anti-disaster systems and capacity, it added.

Ever since the flood hit areas of southern China, the CPC Central Committee has prioritised flood prevention and rescue work.

On May 19, before the floods, while presiding over a meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Xi urged relevant departments and local governments to make all-out efforts to protect people’s lives and property.

Since last month, continuous downpours have lashed large parts of southern China, and the waters of many rivers in affected areas have exceeded warning levels. Some 20.27 million residents have been affected by heavy floods in 24 provincial-level regions across China.

Also this month, some 89,000 houses have been damaged, and direct economic losses have amounted to 49.18 billion yuan ($7 billion), the Ministry of Emergency Management said on Thursday.

Bangladesh Meteorological Department predicts heavy rains

The United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimates that half of Bangladesh will be affected by worsening floods in the coming days.

The Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) and Flood Forecast and Warning Center (FFWC) have echoed the concerns voiced in OCHA’s situation report on Asia Pacific humanitarian efforts on July 17. Both BMD and the FFWC predict heavy rains in the next few days.

Some areas of Dhaka, near Badda, have already become flooded. FFWC says the flood waters came through canals and sewerage lines of the Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority (Dhaka WASA) that are connected to surrounding rivers.

In some districts, such as Netrokona and Naogaon, people have started leaving shelter centers as the water level of various rivers was decreasing. However, BMD and FFWC warn that more rainfall in the next few days may cause the floods to worsen again.

Arifuzzaman Bhuyan, executive engineer of FFWC, said: “From Monday, the water level will start rising again, which may continue till July 25-26. This rise of water levels will inundate different parts of the country and then start decreasing again. No heavy rainfall is expected after July 25-26.”

BMD Meteorologist Abdul Mannan said: “Rainfall upstream and in northern districts of the country has increased compared to the last three days. The increased rainfall may continue for the next three days.

“Rangpur, Rajshahi , Mymensingh, Sylhet and Chittagong will face heavy rainfall in the next three days,” he added.

Mannan continued: “As the rainfall has been increasing, the rivers will get more water. The water from rainfall in Assam does not flow down Bangladesh’s rivers the same day. Some time is needed for the water to flow down the rivers. As a result, the water level may rise even after it stops raining.”

At 9am yesterday, BMD said in a weather forecast that light to moderate rain/thunder showers accompanied by temporary gusty winds are likely to occur at most places over Rangpur, Mymensingh, Chattogram & Sylhet divisions, at many places over Rajshahi and Barishal divisions, and at a few places over Dhaka and Khulna divisions.

Six districts still reeling from previous floods

In Tangail, around 150,000 people are still marooned as the Dhaleshwari, and Jhenai Rivers are still flowing above danger level.

The Dhaleshwari River is flowing 152cm above the danger level while the Jhenai River is flowing 90cm above its danger level, according to the Water Development Board (WDB).

In Madaripur, 15,000 residents of char areas in Sibchar upazila are stranded by floodwaters, as the water level of the Jamuna River continues to swell.

Hundreds of houses, roads, schools and colleges have been submerged and people affected by the floods are suffering a shortage of drinking water, food and sanitation facilities.

Shibchar upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Asaduzzaman said the authorities were trying to help flood victims by providing dry food and safe drinking water.

The WDB has been dumping geo-bags to prevent river erosion, he added.

In Jamalpur, although the Jamuna River has been receding over the past couple of days, the overall situation has worsened and at least 900,000 people remain marooned.

The Jamuna was flowing 105cm over the danger line at Bahdurabad Ghat point in Jamalpur at 6pm on Saturday, declining 24cm from the day before, according to Md Abu Sayeed, executive engineer of WDB.

People of at least 50 villages in Dewangonj, Islampur, Bokshiganj and Jamalpur Sadar have fallen victim to flooding.

In Naogaon, 4194 hectares of cropland went underwater as flood protection embankments collapsed due to the strong currents of the Atarai and Jumuna Rivers, said the Agricultural Extension Department (DAE).

Movement of heavy vehicles through Atrai-Naogaon, Atrai-Bandhaikhara, Atrai-Kaliganj, and Atrai-Singra has been suspended temporarily by the authorities.

In Kurigram, river erosion coupled with incessant rainfall has millions of people in the district suffering.

Many villagers have already left their homes and are living in temporary shelters or wrapped in polythene on government roads, dykes and in other safe places with their livestock and essentials.

Kurigram Water Development (WDB) Executive Engineer Md Ariful Islam said the floods may worsen further in the next three or four days.

In Pabna, the Jamuna River rose at various points while shortages of food and drinking water hit thousands of people hard.

The District WDB is working on tackling river erosion, as many houses on the river banks have been devoured by the floods.

Ministry of Disaster management : No crisis of relief and humanitarian aid

The Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief did not open any shelters in Lalmonirhat, Rangpur, Tangail and Rajbari, although all these districts have been affected by the floods.

Shah Muhammad Nasim, additional secretary (NDRCC and media), Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, said: “In some districts, the flooding is not severe and people in those districts do not want to go to shelters as they have cattle and other valuables at their homes. The government will arrange shelters, if needed.

“There is no lack of effort on the part of the ministry in terms of relief and other help for people affected (by the floods),” he added.

“At least five people were killed in different parts of the Karachi city,” said Mohamed Shafi, a spokesperson for the provincial disaster management authority.

Another 12 people have already lost their lives since the start of monsoon season this year, he said.

Scenes from the deluged city were aired live by local media.

Karachi has more than 15mn residents.

The vast majority lives in slums.

The metropolis is in the headlines every year for urban flooding caused by poor urban development, development in flood plains and clogged drainage system.

Experts believe that extreme precipitation and flows in short spans of time are also responsible for urban flooding.

“Feel sorry about the loss of life due to recent rains in Karachi,” Governor Sindh Imran Ismail said yesterday.

He said we will try and make arrangements to deal with such situations in the future.

Pakistan’s Met office predicted 20% more rain and urban flooding this monsoon season and asked authorities to take precautionary measures.

Flash floods, land erosion, cloudbursts, droughts and smog resulting in low air quality have been on the rise in Pakistan in recent years.

Climate experts say it was the impact of global warming due to the country’s proximity with highly industrialised China and India.

THAILAND: Crystal methamphetamine has now begun to flood into Thailand after the Myanmar authorities recently cracked down on narcotics production and the COVID-19 pandemic caused smuggling delays, according to the country’s drug tsar.

So far for the 2020 fiscal year, 11 tonnes of crystal meth have been seized by authorities in 17 separate operations. Photo: Bangkok Post

Secretary-General of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) Niyom Termsrisuk said drug traffickers have been smuggling large quantities of crystal methamphetamine hydrochloride recently to unload stock which had become stuck in the country earlier.

“As the government started to relax COVID-19 measures, drugs from the neighbouring country made a return after smuggling had been obstructed by national lockdowns as well as Myanmar’s heavy crackdown on production,” Mr Niyom said.

So far for the 2020 fiscal year, 11 tonnes of crystal meth have been seized by authorities in 17 separate operations. Authorities believe that most consignments were en route to third countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.

“Thailand’s geography, with its borders adjacent to drug production sites in the Golden Triangle, and its status as a hub that connects land, air and maritime transport make it hard for the country to avoid being used as a route to smuggle crystal meth to other regions,” said the secretary-general.

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has noted that Thailand and countries in the Mekong subregion are facing more severe narcotic problems, especially with crystal methamphetamine, due to the expansion of synthetic drug manufacture in the region.

According to the ONCB’s operation centre, only 10.8 tonnes of the drug were seized in the whole of the 2019 fiscal year.

During the COVID-19 lockdown easing from May–July, the Thai authorities made eight arrests in relation to the smuggling of over 100kg of crystal methamphetamine, accounting for 4.3 tonnes of the year’s total so far.

On July 11, Surat Thani police arrested three men for smuggling over one tonne of the drug hidden in cow dung. The defendants said they had brought the consignment from Samut Sakhon and were going to drop it in Satun province. The haul was expected to fetch B3.6 billion if sold abroad.

Over the past two weeks alone, officers made two consecutive arrests for drug trafficking in Surat Thani and Narathiwat and seized amounts of crystal methamphetamine weighing 2.44 tonnes in total.","Tue, 14 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thephuketnews.com/photo/listing/2020/1594697086_1-org.jpg,"['floods', 'drug', 'methamphetamine', 'authorities', 'seized', 'fiscal', 'smuggling', 'crystal', 'meth', 'end', 'tonnes', 'lockdown', 'production']",

CHINA CONUNDRUM

As US-China tensions peak ahead of America’s Nov. 3 presidential election, our US Bureau Chief Nirmal Ghosh says China’s strategic overreach is responsible for most of the blowback being witnessed from Washington to New Delhi and Canberra. As US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Nirmal on Wednesday, ‘things have shifted dramatically in the region.

This week, Britain decided to weed out Huawei from its 5G network and Japan, in its annual defence white paper, blasted Chinese territorial claims and vowed to ""strengthen its defence capability at speeds that are fundamentally different from the past"".

Meanwhile, Australian foreign policy scholar Hugh White weighs in on the China issue. Canberra, he says, is seriously worried about its defence but it is not clear what to do about it and its messaging on the issue isn’t all credible or consistent.

THAI ECONOMY ADRIFT

As South-east Asia’s No. 2 economy after Indonesia, Thailand is closely tracked by investors, analysts and political pundits. So, it was a bit of a disappointment when its much anticipated Cabinet reshuffle began in a messy fashion on Thursday, with the government's economic team quitting while Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha was away on a provincial trip. Indochina bureau chief Tan Hui Yee says those who resigned were Finance Minister Uttama Savanayana; Energy Minister Sontirat Sontijirawong; Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation Minister Suvit Maesincee; and Deputy Secretary-General to the Prime Minister for Political Affairs Kobsak Pootrakool.

Dr Uttama confirmed reports that the group's mentor, Deputy Prime Minister and economic czar Somkid Jatusripitak, had also resigned. Their departure leaves a big void. If projections here come true, Thailand's economy, devastated by the pandemic, is expected to contract by 8 per cent for the year and lose some 10 million jobs.

CASINO CRUNCHTIME

This week brought sobering news that Resorts World Sentosa, one of two casino resort operators licensed in Singapore, was shedding hundreds of employees as tourism ground to a halt in the wake of the pandemic.

Now, says Correspondent Toh Ting Wei, it is perhaps only a matter of time that Marina Bay Sands (MBS) also sheds some of its staff. This is because the domestic market alone is unsustainable, and there is no clear timeline as to when tourism can restart. MBS' S$4.5 billion expansion project could also be delayed or scaled down, says Ting Wei. Resorts World is believed to have let go 2,000 employees, a little less than a third of the number on its rolls at end-2019. MBS has more than 10,000 employees.

Meanwhile, Cheryl Teh says those fired face an uncertain future given the dismal state of the economy and particularly in the tourism sector.

AFTER VIRUS, THE DELUGE

Large parts of central and eastern China were reeling on Friday from the worst floods in decades, as disruption mounted for key supply chains, including crucial personal protective equipment for fighting the coronavirus, and economic damage piled up.

The central Chinese city of Wuhan and the provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi and Zhejiang declared red alerts as heavy rain swelled rivers and lakes. Wuhan, on the banks of the Yangtze River where the novel coronavirus emerged late last year, warned residents to take precautions as water levels fast approached their maximum guaranteed safety level.The giant Three Gorges reservoir, which has been holding back more water to try to ease downstream flood risks, is more than 10 metres higher than its warning level, with inflows now at more than 50,000 cubic metres a second.

The Poyang lake in Jiangxi province, which is formed from the overspill of the Yangtze, is 2.5 metres higher than its warning level. It has expanded by more than 2,000 square kilometres during this flood season, and parts of the surrounding town have been inundated.

And it is not as though the virus threat has been fully contained either. Urumqi, the capital of China's far western region of Xinjiang, cancelled hundreds of flights on Friday, after the report of its first coronavirus case in about five months fuelled concerns of a potential new outbreak.

SINGAPORE: As the pandemic dominates international media headlines, tension in the South China Sea has slowly intensified in the background.

Recent incidents include the sinking of a Vietnamese fishing vessel after being hit by the Chinese Coast Guard near the disputed Paracel Islands and the dispatching of Chinese seismic survey vessel Haiyang Dizhi 8 into Malaysia’s exclusive economic zone.

Beijing’s also taken steps to institutionalise control over disputed waters, announcing in April the establishment of two administrative districts under the authority of Sansha city.

Some believe that Beijing is taking advantage of the pandemic to increase its presence in the disputed waters, but such Chinese actions are not new. These recent activities are part of China’s long-term plan to establish de facto control in the South China Sea.

BEIJING’S TWO-PRONGED APPROACH

Beijing has long adopted a two-pronged approach. On the one hand, it has continuously stepped up its military presence and capabilities by building artificial islands and deploying law enforcement vessels to assert maritime rights and claims in the disputed waters.

On the other hand, it has sought to portray itself as a cooperative partner to Southeast Asian claimants.

For much of the three years following the Permanent Court of Arbitration’s 2016 tribunal ruling, China appeared to taken a more conciliatory stance in the South China Sea.

It agreed to negotiations for the Code of Conduct (COC). Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi even expressed hopes for COC negotiations to be completed by 2021.

Some analysts however, argue that this was part of China’s attempt to cushion the fallout and improve its regional image following the 2016 ruling.

PENDULUM-SWINGING BEHAVIOUR FROM CLAIMANTS

For the Southeast Asian claimants, the willingness to call out illegitimate Chinese actions in the disputed waters has oscillated over the years. The pendulum-swinging behaviour of Southeast Asian states stems from the security-economic conundrum that small states face vis-a-vis China.

China has been extremely skilful in using economic incentives to silence Southeast Asian countries in the South China Sea. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, for example, has on multiple occasions expressed his willingness to put aside the 2016 arbitral tribunal ruling in exchange for Chinese investment and cooperation on infrastructure projects.

The pressure on Southeast Asian countries is likely to increase in the aftermath of COVID-19 as many countries face economic recession.

Only four out of 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states are claimants, which greatly hinders the regional organisation’s ability to form a united response toward China. ASEAN is further hindered by fundamental differences in member states’ interests.

Still, with China making incremental gains in the South China Sea every day, it is crucial for ASEAN countries to get their act together if they want to avoid the worst-case scenario of China establishing de facto control over the disputed waters.

Recent actions by Southeast Asian countries point towards an increasing willingness to publicly call out China’s aggression and disregard for international law in the South China Sea.

In December 2019, Malaysia made a partial submission to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) regarding its continental shelf in the northern part of the South China Sea.

In May 2020, Indonesia cited the July 2016 arbitral tribunal ruling when it submitted a note verbale to the United Nations in response to the series of circular notes filed by China in relation to Malaysia’s CLCS submission.

A UNIFYING FACTOR FOR ASEAN

Recent Chinese actions may have awakened Southeast Asian countries to the reality of Beijing’s continued salami-slicing strategy to gradually and systematically establish its presence and legitimise its claims in the South China Sea.

A handout photo by Philippines' Department of National Defense shows a newly built beach ramp at Thitu Island in the disputed South China Sea, Jun 9, 2020. (File photo: Philippines' Department of National Defense/Handout via REUTERS)

Recent Chinese aggression stands in stark contrast to Beijing’s portrayal of itself as a country willing to cooperate and compromise in the South China Sea.

While challenges in formulating a united ASEAN response to the South China Sea remain, a focus on a rules-based maritime order can serve as a unifying factor for Southeast Asian countries. These countries need to recognise that Beijing’s disregard for international law in the South China Sea is a threat to regional security and the interests of all small states.

International law provides small Southeast Asian countries with an equal platform to safeguard their interests in their relations with major powers like China.

At the 36th ASEAN Summit held in June, the Chairman’s Statement contained an explicit mention of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as the basis of settlement of the dispute.

While similar remarks have been included in previous Chairman’s statements, the latest arguably places stronger emphasis on the importance of international law and, in particular, on UNCLOS.

This stronger ASEAN stance could be attributed to Vietnamese stewardship in its role as ASEAN chair. The challenge for ASEAN moving forward is to sustain this current momentum.

ASEAN needs to collectively better communicate to China the importance of maintaining a rules-based order in the South China Sea. Southeast Asian countries cannot allow China to practice exceptionalism in the South China Sea.

It is in the interest of all countries in the region to ensure that maritime rules and norms are respected and upheld by all countries, big or small.

57,57,FF-2020-000170-IDN,China's Q2 GDP growth beats forecasts and recovers to 3.2% - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/China-s-Q2-GDP-growth-beats-forecasts-and-recovers-to-3.2,"SHANGHAI -- China's gross domestic product growth swung back to the black in the April-June quarter, driven by a recovery in production and spending amid coronavirus-induced headwinds, signaling a major turnaround despite the plunging global economy.

The 3.2% year-on-year growth announced by the National Bureau of Statistics on Thursday eclipsed the 6.8% contraction in the first quarter -- the first negative growth since 1992, when the country started announcing growth every quarter. The latest result also beat the median 1.1% forecast by economists surveyed by Nikkei.

Still, it is far below the 6% level recorded for the four quarters of 2019.

President Xi Jinping, in a letter to global chief executives, said that China's sound long-term economic growth fundamentals would not change and promised to continue reforms to attract business and investments, state media outlet Xinhua reported on Thursday.

On a quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted basis, the world's second-largest economy grew 11.5% in the April-June term. Growth on an annualized quarter-on-quarter basis was around 55% in the same quarter, according to Nikkei's own calculation.

Overall growth declined 1.6% in the first half of 2020, but Beijing is upbeat about the rest of the year. ""The steady economic recovery in the first half has laid a solid foundation for a sustained recovery in the second half,"" said an NPC spokesperson. China did not reveal the full-year target this year, something it normally does during its annual national legislative meeting.

While exports grew 0.1% and imports contracted 9.7% during the quarter, economists expect trade to pick up in the second half along with the rest of the global economy.

In fact, monthly trade in U.S. dollar terms bounced into positive territory in June after contracting in May. Exports grew 0.5%, thanks to demand for personal protective equipment and pharmaceutical products, while imports surged 2.7%, largely powered by electronic components and commodities.

Apart from the recovery in trade, growth in the second quarter was driven by the agriculture sector, which rose 3.9%, higher than 3.5% in the previous quarter.

While fixed asset investments in infrastructure, commercial buildings and other areas took a beating, demand for excavators, integrated circuits and industrial robots pushed up industrial-product output 4.4%, compared with the previous quarter's 8.4% contraction.

Total retail sales remained negative at 3.9% but recovered from the 7.6% logged in the first quarter, partly due to spending on basic living goods and medical supplies.

An exporter in the southern manufacturing hub of Guangzhou told the Nikkei Asian Review that seaports have been fully operational since May. While overseas demand for textile and shoes have yet to reach half of last year's sales, orders for auto parts and household products are at pre-COVID levels.

""Market uncertainties remain but our business has stabilized for now,"" said Chen Zhijian, chief executive of Yige Trading.

Nomura China's chief economist, Lu Ting, attributed second-quarter growth to the country's success in controlling the coronavirus and policy support.

Even so, headwinds remain as a large part of the world is still preoccupied with the pandemic.

""The uncertainties and destabilizing factors are increasing significantly,"" warned a customs official on Tuesday, citing existing economic tensions with the U.S. as a potential spark that may hinder trade growth in the second half.

China may have tamed the spread of the virus but many remain wary of a rebound.

""Business income is 50% less than last year,"" said Li Hua, a hairdresser in Shanghai. Residents of the city are generally fussy about their appearance, explained Li, but added that regular customers have stopped coming for premium services that include a perm and dye. ""There isn't really a need as people don't gather as much these days.""

In addition, the country is facing some of its worst flooding in decades. Since June, heavy rainstorms have hit about 64% of the southern region. Areas along the Yangtze River -- China's longest inland waterway -- have been inundated, displacing over 44 million people.

In Wuhan, one of the affected downstream cities and a key industrial hub, waters remained above the warning level as of Wednesday.

Michael Einhorn, President of Dealmed, one of the largest medical supply distributors in the U.S., told Nikkei that he is already having problems getting much-needed supplies out of Wuhan.

Economists at Capital Economics said recovery in the second half will slow after the initial boost from business reopenings has passed. Yet, with consumer confidence and fiscal stimulus on the rise, China's GDP will return to pre-coronavirus levels by the end of the year, faster than any other major economy.","Thu, 16 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F2%252F3%252F1%252F9%252F28279132-1-eng-GB%252Fchina%25EF%25BC%2594.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['second', 'li', 'q2', 'growth', 'trade', 'gdp', 'beats', 'grew', '32', 'forecasts', 'half', 'recovery', 'remain', 'quarter', 'chinas', 'recovers']",

Vietnam has offered $100,000 to China for relief efforts as that country struggles with its worst floods in decades.

The aid is aimed at helping China overcome the consequences of devastating floods and earthquakes in the past weeks, Vietnam’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Friday.

Torrential rains and flooding have occurred in many parts of the country since early June, leaving at least 141 people dead or missing, affecting more than 37 million others, and causing billions of dollars of damage, according to the Chinese government.

Multiple earthquakes were also shaking various regions.

On Thursday ASEAN foreign ministers issued a joint statement on the recent floods in China at the suggestion of Vietnam, the current chair of the bloc, extending their sympathies and condolences to the government and people of China.

""ASEAN affirms its solidarity with the Chinese government and people, stands ready to extend its assistance. ASEAN is confident that China will overcome the challenges and recover swiftly from the impact of this natural disaster,"" the statement reads.

The China Labour Bulletin reports that the government has overlooked rural areas. Migrant workers have been forced to return to their villages to help in relief efforts. Low-income households have been impoverished. Around 20 million low-paid workers are still unemployed.

Hong Kong (AsiaNews) – As with the COVID-19 pandemic, migrant workers have been the most affected by China’s worst floods in decades, which are devastating large swathes of the country, especially the central provinces.

The China Meteorological Administration today issued a rain advisory for the coming days, including hurricane-force winds.

The Ministry of Water Resources said that 93 rivers remain above warning levels, and the Three Gorges dam, the biggest in the country, is constantly monitored.

Floods have so far affected 45 million people (with 142 reported dead and missing); material damage stands around 160 billion yuan (US$ 22.9 billion).

The Hong Kong-based China Labour Bulletin has reported that Chinese authorities have concentrated their aid efforts in large cities, leaving towns and rural areas to fend for themselves. In some areas, flood waters inundated factories and shops.

Many migrant workers rushed back to their home towns to help with the rescue operations because of the lack of government assistance.

Low-paid workers (especially women), who were on the frontlines of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, have not been called once again into action to clean up debris caused by the floods in order to prevent stagnant water from becoming a breeding ground for disease.

Meanwhile, the flood emergency risks slowing down the post-pandemic economic recovery. Although official statistics indicate 3.2 per cent GDP growth in the second quarter of the year, after the 6.8 per cent drop recorded between January and March, unemployment remains high (5.7 per cent).

Even more serious is the loss of purchasing power of households. In the first six months of 2020, per capita income fell by 1.3 per cent, whilst per capita expenditure dropped by 9.3 per cent.

According to a recent study, 30 to 50 million migrant workers lost their jobs in late March because of the pandemic. Of these, 20 million were unable to resume work by mid-May, and those who found a job did so at lower wages.

The survey found that only a small minority of unemployed migrant workers had received unemployment benefits or income support.","Thu, 23 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/CINA_-_0723_-_alluvioni.jpg,"['affected', 'worst', 'migrant', 'causing', 'pandemic', 'areas', 'china', 'flooding', 'covid19', 'workers', 'floods', 'post', 'million', 'millions', 'misery', 'cent']",

The possible areas of further expansion of defence and military ties were discussed during talks between Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his Indonesian counterpart General Prabowo Subianto, officials said.

Reflecting the importance Indonesia attaches to its strategic ties with India, Subianto arrived here on Sunday for the talks, notwithstanding the coronavirus pandemic.

Sources said the issue of possible export of BrahMos cruise missile to Indonesia by India and ways to further deepen maritime security cooperation figured prominently in the talks.

""Both the ministers agreed to further enhance the bilateral defence cooperation in mutually agreed areas. Potential areas of cooperation in the field of defence industries and defence technology were also identified by the two countries,"" the defence ministry said in a statement.

It said both Sing and Subianto committed themselves to further strengthen bilateral cooperation in these areas and take the defence ties to the ""next level of deliverables.""

""The meeting ended on a positive note with a commitment to further strengthen and widen the scope of the bilateral cooperation between the two countries,"" the ministry said, without giving details.

India and Indonesia have robust cooperation in the area of defence and security.

The two countries inked a new defence cooperation agreement in 2018 during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Indonesia. The pact was aimed at reflecting the elevation of relationship between the two countries to a comprehensive strategic partnership.

In Monday's talks, Defence Minister Singh reiterated the long history of mutually beneficial interactions between the two countries with a tradition of close political dialogue, economic and trade linkages as well as cultural and people-to-people interactions.

Officials said both sides explored a range of areas to further expand the strategic cooperation including in the field of defence industries and technology sharing.

It is understood that China's aggressive posturing in eastern Ladakh and South China Sea figured in the talks, but there was no official confirmation about it.

Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, Chief of Army Staff Gen M M Naravane, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal R K S Bhadauria and Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar were among the key officials who were part of the Indian delegation.

Rainfall and a particularly wet June have brought cooler weather.

This is expected to persist throughout July, with the mercury dipping to 22 deg C on some days and more rainfall than the past fortnight, the weatherman said on Thursday (July 16).

Climate experts, however, have pointed out that the cool mid-year weather Singapore is seeing is not unusual.

June and July can be much warmer in some years, as evidenced by patterns for temperature and rainfall for these two months over the decades.

This June was the wettest in the last decade and one of the coolest in the last 20 years.

A total rainfall of 233.8mm exceeded the 213mm recorded in June 2011 and this June's mean temperature of 28.1 deg C was 0.2 deg C lower than the long-term June average.

This also ended a record 28 consecutive months of above-average monthly temperatures.

Last month saw flash floods in Jurong Town Hall Road and New Upper Changi Road and video clips that appeared online showed some vehicles partially submerged near Changi Fire Station.

February and June are usually the driest months of the year.

Monthly rainfall - except for January, February and June - has increased from what was recorded between 1875 and 2017, said Professor Benjamin Horton, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore.

Related Story Temperatures to dip to 22 deg C on some days as wet weather set to continue in July

Even so, some years witnessed torrential downpours during June.

On June 16, 2010, the Orchard Road area was hit with the worst flash floods since 1984.

Shops at Liat Towers and the Lucky Plaza basement were flooded, causing millions in damage.

June 2010's total rainfall was 240.5mm, a 20-year high.

But the wet weather did not stop then, as the following month recorded even more rain. The total rainfall for July 2010 was 298.5mm, also a 20-year high.

According to the National Environment Agency's (NEA) 2010 Annual Weather Review, natural causes for the June 16 torrent included an intense south-west monsoon and a strong and slow moving Sumatra squall which lingered over the city area for over an hour.

These extreme weather conditions arose while La Nina - a climate phenomenon that brings cooler weather and more rainfall to the region - was brewing.

To an extent, the weather for June and July in 2010 mirrors the weather of the past two months.

Weather and climate scientist Koh Tieh Yong said the cooler and wetter weather in June and July this year is partially caused by a cooler sea surface and higher surface pressure in the tropical central Pacific Ocean.

Since winds move from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, moist winds converged in equatorial South-east Asia, causing more rain.

Looking at rainfall and mean temperature data for June and July over the past 20 years, there is a clear oscillating rhythm where temperature and rainfall peak in some years and fall in other years, said Associate Professor Koh, who is also a faculty member at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.

Related Story New weather forecasting system in place to better handle flash floods: PUB

The rhythmic peaks and falls are partially influenced by La Nina and its sibling, El Nino, which bring drier and hotter weather to the region and even droughts at times.

La Nina could occur later this year and climate scientists are looking out for more evidence to confirm this.

They also caution against pinpointing the cool June and July weather this year to climate change.

""Although June's rainfall sets a 10-year record for weather, a decade is a brief moment where climate is concerned. Climate refers to long-term averages and trends, usually over 30 to 100 years,"" said Prof Koh.

NEA's Meteorological Service Singapore website states that Singapore has observed upward trends in rainfall annually but that it is not scientifically possible, using available research information, to pin these trends on global warming, natural climate variability or other causes such as urbanisation.

Said Prof Koh: ""Climate change is a reality but one should be mindful that not every, or even most, record-setting weather can or should be linked to man-made climate change. Otherwise, it would appear unscientific and may encourage similarly unscientific reactions from climate-change deniers.""","Sun, 19 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/07/19/nmrain1907.jpg?itok=MudJ4tbK,"['singapore', 'c', 'cooler', 'experts', 'wetter', 'climate', 'flash', 'rainfall', 'floods', 'temperature', 'say', 'unusual', 'deg', 'weather']",

Almost four million people have been hit by monsoon floods in South Asia, officials said, with a third of Bangladesh already underwater from some of the heaviest rains in a decade. —AFP

BISWAMBHARPUR: Almost four million people have been hit by monsoon floods in South Asia, officials said yesterday, with a third of Bangladesh already underwater from some of the heaviest rains in a decade. The monsoon-which usually falls from June to September-is crucial to the economy of the Indian sub-continent, but also causes widespread death and destruction across the region each year. “This is going to be the worst flood in a decade,” Bangladesh’s Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre chief Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan said.

The heavy rains have swollen two main Himalayan river systems-the Brahmaputra and the Ganges-that flow through India and Bangladesh. Bhuiyan said about a third of flood-prone Bangladesh-a delta-nation crisscrossed by hundreds of rivers-was underwater, and at least 1.5 million people were affected, with village homes and roads flooded.

In north-central Bangladesh, the Brahmaputra river was almost 40 centimeters higher than normal and threatening to burst its banks, district administrator Farook Ahmed said. Most villagers were trying to stay near their flood-damaged homes, but some 15,000 had fled severely affected areas, officials said. With a 10-day forecast pointing to rising waters, Bhuiyan said if more rivers burst their banks some 40 percent of the nation could be flooded “in a worst-case scenario”.

In the northern town of Biswambharpur, villagers said most of the houses were partly underwater after the Surma, a major river in northeast Bangladesh, burst its banks. Farmer Abdur Rashid, 35, said he sent his wife and three children to a multi-storied village school that has been turned into a government shelter. “My whole house has gone underwater. I have sent the rest of the family to the school, but I stayed behind to guard my properties,” Rashid told AFP.

Twin challenges

In Assam, northeast India, more than 2.1 million people have been affected since mid-May. At least 50 people have died so far – 12 in the past week as floodwaters surged-with tens of thousands of mostly rural residents evacuated to relief camps, officials said. Emergency services personnel wore head-to-toe bright-orange suits to protect themselves from the floods and coronavirus-which has infected almost 17,000 people in Assam-as they used boats to reach stranded villagers.

“We have two challenges here, one is COVID-19 and another is (the) flood,” the head of a local rescue team, Abhijeet Kumar Verma, told AFP. In Nepal, at least 50 people have died in landslides and floods triggered by the monsoon rains, with homes swept away and roads and bridges damaged. “We are distributing food and relief goods from helicopters to about 300 displaced families after the roads were blocked by floods and landslides,” district official Gyan Nath Dahal said. —AFP","Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.kuwaittimes.net/website/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sub1-2.jpg,"['region', 'drenches', 'roads', 'bangladesh', 'underwater', 'rains', 'officials', 'monsoon', 'flooded', 'floods', 'flood', 'river', 'million']",

The prices of green chilli has shot up to more than Tk200 in the capital’s kitchen markets with floods damaging crop fields in many districts leading to supply crunch.

Vendors in the capital said the prices of each kilogram of green chili increased to Tk220 from Tk60-80 last week because of supply shortage. They said prices of different vegetables also increased in recent days.

Meanwhile, the price of broiler chickens came down by Tk20 from Tk150 per kg.

According to official figures, more than 8,000 hectares of chilli fields have been damaged by flood so far. Bangladesh produces around 0.14 million tons of green chilli a year.

Shahriar Alam, a resident of Bangshal of Old Dhaka, said he bought a kg of green chilli for Tk220 last week which was Tk60-80 two weeks ago.

“A kg tomato cost Tk130 which was Tk50-60 a couple of weeks ago. Prices of most vegetables increased in the kitchen market due to supply shortage,” he said.

Abu Bakar Siddique, vegetable trader of Najirabazar of Old Dhaka, said he sold each kg green chilli at Tk200-Tk220, tomato at Tk120-130, papaya at Tk60, bitter gourd at Tk80, lemon (four pieces) at Tk20-32, and eggplant and pointed gourd (potol) at Tk50-60 on Monday.

“Several items at the kitchen market somewhat went up in the last couple of days. We have nothing to do if the price increases in the wholesale market. We sell these in some profit,” he also said.

‘Survival is tough’

Zillur Rahman, a shopkeeper of the area, said they were selling each kg of local onion at Tk40-50 and imported one at Tk30, garlic at Tk80-100, and ginger at Tk140-150.

“However, we are selling each kg cardamom at Tk3,200, cinnamon at Tk500, and cloves at Tk1,200 which somewhat increased with the second largest festival religious festival incoming,” he said.

He said there is a good demand for the spices during Eid, so their prices may go up in the coming days before the second largest religious festival of Muslims in Bangladesh.

Abdus Sobhan Talukder, a vegetable wholesaler at Kawran Bazar, said floods have affected vegetable production.

“We’re struggling because of Covid-19, and the flood is another curse. Our business is on the wane. It’s very tough to survive now,” he said.

Agriculture Minister Dr Muhammad Abdur Razzaque said the government took different initiatives to reduce the Tk349 crore damage caused by the flood.

“Flood-hit and small farmers will also get free saplings of Aman to plant through rice transplanter at a cost of Tk54 lakh. Around 50,000 farmers will be provided with fertilizer and seeds of mashkalai worth Tk3.82 crore if they fail to produce Aman in flood-hit areas,” he said.

The minister said in the first phase, floods from June 25 to July 8 affected approximately 76,310 hectares of paddy fields and 344,000 farmers in 14 districts.

In the second phase, from July 11 to July 19, around 83,000 hectares of paddy fields in 26 districts, including the previous 14 districts, were damaged.","Mon, 27 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2020/07/watermarked/337283/1595838564175gaibandha-6-1587727812946-1595838395937.jpg,"['prices', 'increased', 'vegetable', 'push', 'green', 'kitchen', 'chilli', 'kg', 'dhaka', 'floods', 'supply', 'fields', 'markets', 'market']",

The Covid-19 lockdown coupled with fund shortages have crippled Christian groups' ability to reach out to the flood-hit Assam state in northeast India, where 66 people have lost lives and 3.6 million are marooned.

“We are in a terrible situation not knowing what to do as all over the state is flooded and people are struggling to find food and accommodation,” said Bishop Thomas Pullopillil of Bongaigaon diocese on July 16.

The local meteorological department has predicted heavy rainfall over the next 72 hours, creating fear in the minds of people who are already bearing the brunt of the torrential rain and resultant flood.

The agency warned that “the situation will further deteriorate.”

The government has put the flood death toll for the season at 66 and those badly affected by it at 3.6 million, highlighting the enormity of a crisis that the state is facing amid its Covid-19 lockdown.

“The torrential rain and floods are an annual phenomenon, however, this year it has broken all records"" affecting millions, said Bishop Pullopillil told UCA News.

“The government agencies are doing what little they can but that is not enough to address the enormity of the situation,” he said.

“Church agencies of different denominational churches, including Catholics, used to pool resources from different agencies and help the people in situations like this.

“Unfortunately, now we are unable to do much for those struggling as our funds were spent feeding the stranded migrant workers and other poor during the Covid-19 lockdown,” the prelate said.

Meanwhile, Father G. P. Amalraj, the deputy secretary of the northeastern regional bishops’ council, told UCA News that “Most Catholic dioceses in Assam and other northern eastern states are suffering from severe financial crises. So we are not able to reach out to the flood-affected people.""

He said they are asking individual Churches to do ""whatever little they can to help the needy.”

Dibrugarh diocese in Assam was particularly affected with many institutions under flood water for a week at the end of June, as well the houses of hundreds of thousands of people in the diocese.

“The bishop’s house and cathedral flooded after water from the Brahmaputra overflowed and entered villages and towns in the diocese and other localities in the state,” according to Father Palatty Devassy, secretary to the bishop.

“Now, there is some respite from the rain but the situation is likely to get worse"" with predictions of more rains.

“We can do hardly anything to help those stranded or marooned in the flood as the Covid-19 lockdown has restricted travel in the state,” the priest said.

Allen Brooks, spokesperson for the Assam Christian Forum, an umbrella organization of all Christian denominational churches in the area said, “Church leaders [of all denominations] took stock of the plight of people of Assam on July 14 and the ways to help them at this hour of crisis.

“Everyone is facing serious financial problems. Many pastors have not taken their salary over the past three months,” he told UCA News on July 15.

“Even if we want to do something we cannot go out of our homes and it is almost impossible for us to help those who are stranded,"" said Brooks, who is based in Guwahati, the state's commercial capital.

""I cannot move out of the district because of Covid-19 restrictions, and this is the case for most others too,"" he said.

Church groups have now agreed to gather aid through the local churches and ""do whatever we can for those in our close vicinity,” Brooks said.

Brooks also blamed the government for its failure to repair embankments this year which he claimed aggravated the food situation.

Bishop Pullopillil said he regretted that “the state is not getting any focus in the national news despite such a huge calamity.”

With the next month is likely to be one of the worst of the rainy season, the bishop warned: “If the situation continues like this, we do not know what our plight will be.”","Thu, 16 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ucanews.com/uploads/2020/07/churches-struggling-to-help-flood-victims-in-india-5f10161926530_600.png,"['uca', 'state', 'stranded', 'situation', 'northeast', 'rain', 'covid19', 'india', 'help', 'struggle', 'victims', 'flood', 'assam', 'told', 'churches']",

Water Development Board Executive Engineer Md Ariful Islam said the flood situtation may worsen further due to the rains in the upcoming few days

Golzar Hossain, a labourer from Chilmari upazila, had to evacuate his home and take refuge with his wife and children at the Matikata- Ramnaghat road intersection in the first phase of the floods this season.

For the last two weeks he has been living there with his family and this last Sunday afternoon that road was inundated as well.

It was pouring till early Sunday morning, where many like Golzar's family had been living on the waterlogged roads with tents made of polythene and cloth.

Golzar’s wife said they are struggling to manage three meals a day. She has been cooking on a borrowed stove and the struggle is worsened by a crisis of no toilets.

Similar sentiments were expressed by labourer Ashraful Alam Mukul who is also suffering in the rain and floods with his family. Thousands of other families are suffering quite the same.

Around 80% of Rowmari upazila has been flooded, and people rendered destitute in the upazila took shelter on the Dhaka-Rowmari road.One of them is Noor Hossain.

Noor is currently camping out on the road in Golabari of Jadurchar union with his wife and three children. He said no relief has been provided to him in the four days or so that he has been living on the road.

""On the one hand there is floodwater, and then there is rain. I don't have any money, nor have I received any relief support. I am in great trouble with my children,"" said Noor.

Muddy water and an unhygienic environment have engulfed the flood-affected people in Kurigram, at a time when cleanliness is most essential because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Even open spaces on higher ground such as roads and embankments aren't ready to support the poor, as rain and erosion won't leave them anytime soon.

The agriculture weather monitoring station in Rajarhat upazila recorded 120mm of rain until 9am on Sunday, said the station’s in-charge, Subol Chandra Sarkar. He added that Kurigram may again be hit by heavy rains in the next two days.

As floodwaters wash away the homes of many, and erosion takes people's land, a few hundred families in the district are living in great misery. Hundreds of thousands are in dire need due to the financial losses they have incurred due to the floods.

Countless people who have taken shelter on different roads in Chilmari, Rajibpur, and Rowmari unions of Rowmari upazila, are hungry and in fear of an ever worsening situation with their children and domesticated animals.

Water Development Board Executive Engineer, Md Ariful Islam, says the floods may worsen very soon due to the rains in the coming few days.

""The flood control embankment may fall into a bit of a risk due to the prolonged flooding. But we are monitoring the situation and are prepared to do our best in this regard,"" Ariful added.

The Brahmaputra and Dharla rivers have been flowing above the danger lines until Sunday morning in Kurigram and the swelling of the rivers may increase further due to incessant rainfall, continued the WDB engineer.

Hafizur Rahman, additional deputy commissioner of the district, said relief allocation has been requested and will be distributed when it arrives, among people affected by the floods.","Sun, 19 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2020/07/watermarked/336421/1595169207493kurigran-flood-july-19-1595168560649.jpg,"['upazila', 'triple', 'floods', 'children', 'kurigram', 'blow', 'roads', 'road', 'living', 'rowmari', 'erosion', 'wife', 'flood', 'rain', 'shelter', 'face']",

In the wake of the heavy downpour in Mumbai and coastal Maharashtra, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Wednesday upgraded the warning status from orange to red, a special bulletin on the city's rain said on Wednesday.

The city has been witnessing heavy rains since Tuesday night, resulting in water logging in many areas.

Red alert has been issued for Mumbai, R K Jenamani, scientist with the National Weather Forecasting Centre, said.

The bulletin said scattered “heavy to very heavy rainfall” with isolated “extremely heavy falls” are very likely to occur over Mumbai city, Thane, Raigad and Ratnagiri districts during the next 18 hours.

The bulletin added that due to the heavy rains, the inundation of low-lying areas is expected. The rains could also lead to disruption in electricity and water supply, local traffic and road transport.

The Internet has been rendered speechless at the strength of the monument that has been able to survive many such calamities in the past 700 years including the recent floods that have claimed over 140 lives in China.

Prompting immediate evacuation of almost 15 million, the turbulent floods on July 19 engulfed nearly every structure in the region. However, the temple which was built in the Song Dynasty (960-1279) and then reconstructed in the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) on a dragon-shaped rock in the middle of the Yangtze River remained unimpacted by the massive flooding that caused heavy destruction. Shot by the by @Yichanjun, an ancient architecture enthusiast, the clip depicted the entire area covered with water, while the temple, that lived the 1998 floods that killed nearly 4,000 people still stood unharmed by either the torrential rain or the dangerous water currents.

Summer is the ideal time to take advantage of these schemes, which offer a chance to take a politically committed vacation that can also contribute to a break for the planet.

A recent survey conducted by GlobeScan for the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) of over 20,000 individuals across 23 countries has shown a growing interest in the preservation of ocean environments: in particular, among young people (18-24 years old), who have indicated a willingness to change their consumer habits. For example, 89 percent of that age group indicate their willingness to take action in the future to protect fish and seafood in the ocean habitat.



Plastic pollution, overfishing, oil drilling... Human activity has an increasingly disastrous impact on the world's oceans, which provide 50 percent of our oxygen and feed more than a billion people on the planet, GreenPeace has warned. In response to this state of affairs, the international environmental NGO recently launched an online petition ""to protect 30 percent of the world's oceans by 2030"", which has already been signed by more than three million people.

Here is roundup of just some of the programs around the world that may be of interest to those of you who are planning a beach vacation this summer and would like to take part in a politically committed initiative to protect marine fauna.

Collecting waste from beaches and the ocean floor



The Surfrider Foundation, a well-established American non-profit which has been involved in the protection of oceans and coastlines for decades, organizes a variety of initiatives in different countries around the world including schemes that enable tourists to participate in beach-waste collections and dives to remove plastic from the coastal seabed. On the foundation's website, there is an interactive map showing locations and dates for the different initiatives this summer

Fishing for nets in the Mediterranean

Strongly involved in the preservation of oceans and marine species, the American NGO Sea Shepherd, which is active in several countries around the world, offers volunteers an opportunity to participate in different types of initiatives: one that has been very successful in France is the ""Mare Nostrum"" operation, which involved an extensive series of dives in the Mediterranean Sea to recover abandoned fishing nets, which are a dangerous trap for marine species.

Protecting sea turtles

With the exception of polar regions, sea turtles are present in all oceans of the world. However, their continued existence is now endangered by plastic-waste poisoning and relentless hunting by poachers. The protection of critical sites where turtles lay their eggs is a crucial aspect of the drive to protect these species.

With this in mind, several NGOs have launched operations on the shores of the Pacific and Indian oceans, which enable volunteers to collect turtle eggs, supervise their hatching and feed baby turtles to boost their chances of survival when they are set free in the ocean. Tourists in these areas have an opportunity to donate to these programs and also to release the sea turtles into the ocean. This is notably the case in Kuta on the island of Bali, Indonesia, with an initiative organized by the Bali Sea Turtle Society.

For those who have more time on their hands, it is possible to devote several weeks to programs of this kind, notably in Nicaragua with the non-profit Cybelle Planète or in Mayotte with Sea Shepherd's Operation Nyamba.","Thu, 16 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2019/02/27/2019_02_27_66473_1551240280._large.jpg,"['marine', 'ocean', 'initiatives', 'preserve', 'world', 'worlds', 'turtles', 'sea', 'opportunity', 'programs', 'summervacation', 'protect', 'oceans']", 
73,73,FF-2020-000170-IDN,"New genes control plant height, could lead to flood-proof crops - Science Magazine",https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/new-genes-control-plant-height-could-lead-flood-proof-crops,"New genes control plant height, could lead to flood-proof crops

Stature matters to plants. Short crops can carry more grain without bending under their own weight—a key trait that helped power the Green Revolution in the 1960s. But tall plants are better at surviving long floods. Now, researchers have found two genes that together help control the height of rice plants: one that accelerates the elongation of the stem and another that acts as a brake. If the system is similar in other plants, scientists say it could be useful in the breeding of many kinds of crops.

“This could be one more great tool in the toolbox,” says Julia Bailey-Serres, a rice biologist at the University of California, Riverside, who was not involved in the new research.

In the mid–20th century, plant breeders typically selected for wheat and rice varieties with short stems; these plants devoted more resources to grain and were less likely to fall over in heavy wind or rain. Biologists later discovered that these varieties, at certain times in their development, produce less of a hormone called gibberellic acid (GA) or can’t respond to its signals to elongate their stems. Side effects of those mutations can include young plants that sometimes emerge from the ground too soon in drought-prone regions.

Plant molecular geneticist Motoyuki Ashikari of Nagoya University and colleagues have been studying rice varieties that survive long, deep floods by growing taller—and quickly, if need be, up to 25 centimeters per day. So-called “deep-water rice” is grown in delta areas, mainly in Southeast Asia where slow seasonal floods can reach 1 meter or deeper. Previous work had shown that when plants are submerged, ethylene gas accumulates in their tissues and triggers GA production. Ashikari and his colleagues wanted to know how GA coaxes stems to grow in deep-water varieties of rice.

The team compared the DNA of one species of deep-water rice with another rice variety that can only grow in shallow water. They soon located the two genes, which they dubbed ACE1 (accelerator of internode elongation) and DEC1 (decelerator of internode elongation). Greenhouse experiments showed what the genes did: In deep-water rice, ACE1 turns on when plants are covered in water, stimulating cell division in their stems and helping them grow, the researchers report this week in Nature . But a typical shallow-water variety, which has a mutation in ACE1, did not lengthen its stem when flooded.

In other experiments, the team showed that DEC1 suppresses stem growth. DEC1 was active in the shallow-water variety, and it stayed active when those plants were flooded, essentially keeping the brakes on stem growth. In contrast, when deep-water rice was exposed to flooding, the brakes were lifted: DEC1 stopped expressing, further allowing for stem growth.

If plant breeders or molecular biologists can control those two genes, they might be able to adjust plant height without having to modify GA levels—perhaps even in crops other than rice—says Laura Dixon, a plant biologist at the University of Leeds. That means GA would continue to influence other parts of the plant normally. The two new genes could act like a simple “dimmer switch” for plant height, says Susan McCouch, a rice biologist at Cornell University, who was also not involved in the research.

The two genes also exist in sugarcane, barley, and the well-studied grass Brachypodium distachyon. They might occur widely in other agriculturally important grasses, Ashikari believes. Another important crop, corn, has an equivalent to ACE1, but it has a gene that only partially resembles DEC1. Still, the range of species with the two genes makes the new discovery “supersignificant,” McCouch says.

The genes might help rice breeders improve low-yield varieties that can already cope with seasonal flooding—or engineer new ones from productive shorter varieties. If this approach works in other plants, it could even help engineer flood-proof crops for areas experiencing more frequent flooding because of climate change, including the U.S. Midwest, Bailey-Serras says. Such efforts would depend entirely on whether the genes in the target crops are responsive, but, “It would make a heck of a lot of difference to the farmer.”","Thu, 16 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/rice_1280p_0.jpg?itok=HHv6OJHS,"['crops', 'height', 'ga', 'floodproof', 'control', 'varieties', 'genes', 'rice', 'stem', 'plants', 'lead', 'deepwater', 'university', 'dec1', 'plant']",

The major rivers were still flowing above the danger mark at 10 points in Kurigram, Gaibandha, Jamalpur, Bogura, and Sirajganj districts at 9 am today

The floods continued to aggravate in several districts of the country causing further agony to locals though the flooding remained mostly stable in eight northern districts during the last 24 hours ending 9am Sunday.

Officials of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) said the water levels of major rivers marked a fall at most points during the period, with a possibility of improvement in the next 48 to 72 hours.

According to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre of BWDB, no notable monsoon rains were recorded, both upstream of the northeastern Indian states, as well as downstream in the Brahmaputra basin during the last 24 hours.

The major rivers were still flowing above the danger mark at 10 points in Kurigram, Gaibandha, Jamalpur, Bogura, and Sirajganj districts at 9 am today.

In Gaibandha, although the water level of the Ghaghat, Karatoya and Teesta rivers has been steady in the last 24 hours, the Brahmaputra river has been flowing 98cm above the danger mark at Fulchhari point of the river.

The fluctuating water levels have waterlogged at least 1,50,000 people in 31 unions of 7 upazilas, according to the district’s BWDB sources. Flood in Jamalpur. Photo taken on Sunday, July 26, 2020 | Dhaka Tribune

In Jamalpur, the stagnant flood--which has waterlogged the district for 26 consecutive days-- marooned 10,00,000 people in 677 villages of 59 unions till Sunday.

The Jamuna river was flowing 112cm above the danger mark at Bahadurabad point on Sunday afternoon, which is alarming, said BWDB sources.

Though local representatives had taken significant steps to help the poor, their misery is immeasurable, said UNO Mizanur Rahman.

The water level will continue to rise until July 28 and the flood situation will deteriorate in the district, said Abu Syed, executive engineer of BWDB.

In Tangail, the water levels of the Dhaleshwari, Jamuna, and Jhinai rivers have been significantly swelling above the danger mark, leaving at least 2,00,000 people marooned in the district.

Like most flood-hit districts, consistent flooding has caused huge damage to the agricultural region, leaving more than 10,000 hectares of cropland under water.

River erosion will intensify the damage caused by the floods and it will begin again, soon after the waters recede in the area, said Sirajul Islam, executive engineer of BWDB. A part of the damaged roads in Kurigram that fell victim to ongoing flood continued for about a month. Photo taken on Sunday, July 26, 2020 | Dhaka Tribune

In Kurigram, people hit by the floods are suffering from a shortage of food and government assistance as they struggle to survive and worry over a bleak future.

The inundation of vast swathes of areas in the district has caused another problem—shortage of fodder. The situation could force farmers to sell their cows at nominal prices ahead of Eid-ul-Azha.

In some areas, houses have been flooded, forcing hundreds of people to live under the open sky. Besides, many people are starving as they did not receive adequate government aid.

In Rajshahi, the incessant rise of most rivers in the Ganges and Brahmaputra basins has further worsened the flood situation in the region.

Water levels in the rivers of the two basins rose at 40 points, receded at 18 points, and remained stable at two points, which further aggravated the flood situation in the char (river bed) and other low-lying areas, reports BSS.

In Pabna, around 20 thousand families of one hundred villages in five upazilas of district have been marooned as they were waterlogged.

Many of the affected areas are also facing massive river erosion.

In Sirajganj, countless people have become homeless and destitute owing to the river erosion.

The affected people have taken refuge in shelter centres for their safety, leaving behind their belongings including furniture, household goods, and even cattle.

In Rangpur also, farmers have been hit hard by the floods. The government, through the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), has taken frantic steps to assist affected farmers in recouping crop losses caused by floods in two phases in the Rangpur agriculture region.

Muhammad Ali, additional director of the DAE for the Rangpur region, said on Sunday that the second phase of the deluge has submerged standing crops on 12,294 hectares of land in 30 affected upazilas of all five districts in the region.

During the first phase of the deluge, standing crops on 13,465 hectares of land were submerged. Of those, crops on 8,612 hectares of land were totally damaged causing production losses of 32,664 tons of crops worth Tk104.83 crore in the region.

The ministry said 23 districts will be affected by the floods

Flood situation may deteriorate further in 15 northern and central districts due to the rise of water level of main rivers including Padma, Ganges, Jamuna, and Brahmaputra.

At 9am on Wednesday, country’s Flood Forecast and Warning Centre (FFWC) said that the flood situation of Kurigram, Gaibandha, Bogra, Jamalpur, Sirajganj, Tangail, Natore, Naogaon, Munshiganj, Manikganj Faridpur, Madaripur, Rajbari, Shariatpur and Dhaka will deteriorate further in next 24 hours.

However, the flood situation may improve in Sylhet and Sunamganj.

FFWC at 9am on Wednesday stated that the water level of Padma, Ganges, Jamuna and Brahmaputra was rising which may continue in the next 48 hours.

Moreover Padma may cross the danger level at Sureswar point under Shariatpur district in next 24 hour though the river was flowing 61cm above the danger level at Goaluno point of Rajbari, 28cm and 25cm above the danger line at Bhagyakul and Mawa point of Munshiganj districts respectively.

Arifuzzaman, executive engineer of FFWC said: “Water level is rising due to upstream rainfall which will submerge low plain lands of the said districts more.”

Of the 101 water level monitoring stations of the Bangladesh Water Development Board across Bangladesh, 56 stations observed an increase in water levels, while 41 saw a decrease. The water level remained unchanged at four stations.

Water levels at 21 points in rivers across the country are currently flowing above the danger mark including on the Brahmaputra, Jamuna, Surma, Gur, Ghagot, Atrai, Padma, Kushiyara, and Dhaleshwari rivers. Water level at 17 points which are already flowing above the danger level is on a rising trend.

However, water level of the rivers of the upper Meghna basin at North-eastern region is decreasing which may continue in the next 48 hours, FFWC said.

About 20,000 people took shelter in 1,035 shelter centres in 12 flood affected districts as of Tuesday, according to the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief. In all, 17 affected districts have been inundated by the floods, which have affected 1,457,827 people. 294,274 families are marooned in the floodwater.

Each affected district has received Tk500,000 from the ministry to provide cooked food in shelters.

About 8,210MT of rice, over Tk2.82 crore, 74,000 packets of dry food, Tk48 lakh for cattle food and another Tk48 lakh for baby food have been given so far. Three-hundred bundles of tin and Tk9 lakh have been distributed to repair damaged houses, Disaster Management and Relief Ministry said.

77,77,FF-2020-000170-IDN,Argentina counts on new satellite technology to guard forests day and night - Jakarta Post,https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2020/07/25/argentina-counts-on-new-satellite-technology-to-guard-forests-day-and-night.html,"Argentina plans to put into orbit a satellite with new precision technology in the coming days, to monitor felling of its native forests round the clock and accurately measure forest carbon stocks in a bid to help curb climate change, scientists said.

The SAOCOM 1B satellite, manufactured in the South American country, is due to be launched between July 25 and 30 from Cape Canaveral in Florida, managed by experts from Argentina's National Commission for Space Activities (CONAE).

The satellite, equipped with the latest technology, represents a huge leap from those that use optical sensors.

SAOCOM 1B's main Earth observation instrument is a radar that works with microwaves in the electromagnetic L-band space, providing information 24/7 about what it can see: soil moisture, crops, forest structure and changes in glaciers.

""There is only one similar satellite developed by the Japanese space agency,"" Laura Frulla, head of research for the SAOCOM mission, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""It's a very important advance because optical sensors work with sunlight, but microwaves go through clouds, work in rain and don't need light,"" she added.

The new development comes at a key moment.

""Argentina is not only in a health emergency due to COVID-19 but also in a forestry and climate emergency,"" warned Hernán Giardini, coordinator of Greenpeace's forests campaign in Argentina.

A UN report published in 2015 identified Argentina as one of the 10 most deforested countries in the world. Between 1990 and 2015, it lost forests equivalent to the size of Scotland.

The decline in forest cover has since slowed but continues, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said this year.

Official figures from the Argentinian government show 182,000 hectares were deforested in 2018 - about half in protected areas - down from 350,000 hectares in 2012.

But in the first half of 2020, with coronavirus restrictions since March making it harder to enforce protection, Argentina lost more forest than in the same period last year, according to Greenpeace, which tracks optical satellite images.

""Just during the quarantine, 21,000 hectares were deforested - an area equivalent to the city of Buenos Aires,"" Giardini told the Congressional Natural Resources Commission this month.

The critical area is the Gran Chaco, a wide South American tropical and subtropical region which includes four northern provinces of Argentina: Formosa, Chaco, Salta and Santiago del Estero.

That area, which captures 50 percent of the carbon stored in the country's forests, is also where 80 percent of clearance takes place.

The main causes of deforestation are expansion of soybean cultivation and intensive livestock breeding, as well as forest fires. The Chaco forests are cut down to plant pasture and raise livestock for meat exports to China and the European Union.

Pristine protection

In Argentina, the greatest deforestation occurs in the tropical area of Gran Chaco, where dense clouds are common, said Pablo Mércuri of the National Agricultural Technology Institute.

""With more information from this region we will be able to track native forests much better,"" he said.

""The optical satellites used today do not capture images on cloudy days or at night, but the new ones allow you to traverse the clouds and operate both day and night,"" he explained.

SAOCOM 1B will be complemented by SAOCOM 1A, put into orbit in 2018, which provides some images but is still ""in the process of calibration"", Mércuri said.

The two will form a constellation that will provide greater variety and frequency of data, in conjunction with satellites from other countries that use similar X-band microwave technology but cannot penetrate forest cover.

SAOCOM's Frulla said the new system will be useful because it allows monitoring of changes in both planted and native forest that look different. Three hours after logging or a fire, the affected area can be measured and its recovery observed.

Unlike optical satellites which only provide estimates, the new system will accurately measure biomass, whether it is dry or wet, the tree type, undergrowth and humidity levels, she said.

The satellites can also be used to detect areas at risk of fires, floods and crop diseases, allowing for early warning.

The L-band radar technology, which penetrates the surface, is dominated by Argentina and Japan, and may be sold to other countries as the satellites observe the whole of the Earth, passing twice a day at the same point, she noted.

Mércuri said radar satellites can capture the density of a forest and different structures within it.

To raise awareness of the importance of using forests sustainably, more and better data like this needs to be produced, he noted.

""Native forests are not even - they are very thinned by deforestation and in some areas inaccessible,"" he said.

The satellite information will make it possible to identify forest areas that should remain pristine, he added.

The system will also help quantify carbon stocks in the forest and soil, and certify them.

This process is important to verify carbon credits that can be purchased to offset greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere.

""This technology will allow us to make high-precision inventories at the sites of greatest interest,"" Mércuri added.","Sun, 26 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/07/25/2020_07_25_100958_1595670872._large.jpg,"['day', 'technology', 'night', 'area', 'saidthe', 'forest', 'satellites', 'optical', 'satellite', 'chaco', 'counts', 'argentina', 'guard', 'forests']",

KATHMANDU, Nepal: Landslides and flooding caused by heavy rainfall have blocked the main highway connecting most of Nepal to the Himalayan nation's capital, preventing trucks from bringing in fuel and supplies, officials said Tuesday.

There were several landslides along the Prithvi Highway that either blocked the road or damaged portions of it, police official Rabindra Regmi said. Heavy equipment was being used to try to clear the debris to open up the highway.

A flooded river also damaged a bridge on the highway, and hundreds of vehicles were stranded on either side of the route.

The highway is used by both passenger vehicles and cargo trucks to transport food, supplies and fuel to the capital, Kathmandu.

Since Nepal's monsoon season began last month, landslides, flooding and Lightning have killed at least 131 people and left 48 others missing.

The Tangail town protection dam has fallen under fresh threat as a 250 metre area by the Pungli River had been broken at Shibpur Pachhbathoi area in Sadar upazila due to erosion.

Sirajul Islam, executive engineer at the Water Development Board in Tangai,l said: ""The embankment is important in keeping the town safe from floodwaters. Already 12,000 geo-bags have been dumped in the damaged area.""

In Bogra, fresh areas of Sariakandi, Shonatala, and Dhunot upazilas have been flooded as the Jamuna and Bangali rivers continued to flow above the danger mark until Saturday afternoon.

According to sources from the district's relief and rehabilitation office 128,715 people in the three upazilas have remained marooned. Moreover, crops on 9,500 hectares of land have sustained damage.

32 children drown in floodwaters

At least 32 children have drowned after accidentally falling into floodwaters in Kurigram, Jamalpur and Tangail during this season's flood until now.

In Kurigram, 20 people have died after accidentally falling into floodwaters and among them 16 are children, said Kurigram Civil Surgeon Dr Habibur Rahman.

In Jamalpur, local Union Parishad chairman and Upazila Nirbahi Officers confirmed the deaths of at least 11 children who died after accidentally falling into floodwaters, reports our Jamalpur correspondent Biswajit Deb.

In Tangail, at least six children were killed after falling into floodwaters, according to the local Union Parishad chairpersons.

Tk72 crore loss sustained by farmers in Natore

Farmers had to suffer losses of altogether Tk72 crore in paddy, vegetables and fish farming due to the month long flood, calculated the district's Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) office.

Rabiah Noor Ahmed, an agriculture officer of the district, on Saturday said: ""4,144 hectares of crop field was inundated and as water receded, we could calculate that 3,976 hectares among those sustained damage. If the rain continues, the water logging may cause further damage.

Firoz Ahmed, a fisheries officer in the district, said: ""Fishes of 321 ponds have been washed away. The total area of these ponds is about 300 hectares. The total loss sustained by the fish farmers is calculated to Tk21 crore.”

84,84,FF-2020-000170-IDN,Dam built by robots? Japan's Obayashi tests it out - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Engineering-Construction/Dam-built-by-robots-Japan-s-Obayashi-tests-it-out,"TOKYO -- Japanese contractor Obayashi has started to build a dam almost entirely with robots, addressing the industry's labor shortage and aging workforce.

The site of the trial project is a concrete dam in Mie Prefecture, on the southeast coast of Japan's main island. The 84-meter-high structure is slated for completion in March 2023.

Obayashi has developed automated equipment to stack concrete layers to form a dam. To further streamline the process, a plant has been built near the site to mix sand and gravel with cement to make concrete.

Building a dam requires knowledge and skill developed through years of experience. Obayashi's automated system is expected to be a game-changer in dam construction, as well as in other applications.

""By transferring expert techniques to machines, we're able to analyze what was once implicit knowledge,"" said Akira Naito, head of Obayashi's dam technology unit.

Every process for constructing the 334-meter-wide dam will involve some form of automation. That includes the initial work of establishing the foundation, and pouring concrete to form the body.

The dam's body is built in layers by pouring concrete into 15-meter square partitions. Tower cranes that pour the concrete are controlled remotely by office computers, which also monitor the positioning of the partitions and the progress of construction.

Humans will man the cranes for safety reasons, but the machines are self-operating.

Building a dam is an intricate endeavor that requires all crevices to be sealed to prevent breaches. Concrete surfaces need to be processed so they are tightly stacked on one another.

Layers that are uneven are usually brushed down by human professionals until they are flat. Obayashi has developed machines that handle the brushing. The frequency of the cyclical brushing and the pressure on the surface are automatically controlled.

As poured concrete builds up, the forms used to give it structure need to be raised to keep unset concrete from leaking out. Normally, multiple skilled workers in heavy machinery operate in tandem to gradually lift the forms, calling out to each other to coordinate their movements.

Obayashi has developed a robot to handle this task, allowing for humans to be cut out of the picture entirely.

Surprisingly, Obayashi says all of its futuristic solutions have only increased productivity by about 10%, since it still needs to have people on-site ready to jump in should things go wrong. The company plans to acquire more know-how so it can eventually reduce the amount of manpower it needs.

""Eventually, we may be able to cut building time by 30%,"" said Naito.

Other Japanese contractors are also working on automation. Kajima has developed self-driving bulldozers and dump trucks so construction can continue 24 hours a day. It has automated the lifting of concrete forms, which it used at a dam construction site in Hokkaido for the first time.

Dam construction is especially conducive to automation, since it involves a lot of repetition and tends to happen on sprawling sites far from population centers, meaning there is less risk of automated equipment hitting bystanders or other machinery.

Japan's construction industry is aging quickly, with 35% of all workers now 55 or older, according to the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors. Companies are scrambling to build robots based on workers' expertise before they retire. The companies also hope that new technology could dispel negative stereotypes of the industry among younger generations, encouraging more people to work in construction.

Stricter regulations on overtime, which take effect on construction sites starting in 2024, have contributed to the trend toward automation. Contractors are struggling to meet their goal of guaranteeing two days off a week on their sites. They will need to incorporate automation technology used in dams in other types of construction as well.

Kajima has partnered with rival Takenaka on automation. Robots are becoming not just a way to boost productivity on construction sites, but also a major factor in the competitiveness of Japan's contractors.","Thu, 23 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F2%252F4%252F8%252F1%252F28391842-1-eng-GB%252F%25E5%25A4%25A7%25E6%259E%2597%25E7%25B5%2584%25E3%2581%25AE%25E3%2583%25AD%25E3%2583%259C%25E3%2581%25AB%25E3%2582%2588%25E3%2582%258B%25E3%2583%2580%25E3%2583%25A0%25E5%25B7%25A5%25E4%25BA%258B20200722135849104_Data_2048x1152.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['built', 'used', 'developed', 'automated', 'dam', 'automation', 'tests', 'robots', 'contractors', 'workers', 'obayashi', 'construction', 'japans', 'sites', 'concrete']",

KUPANG, Indonesia: A giant 23-metre (75-foot) whale briefly washed up near a beach in Indonesia but it was unclear how the enormous marine mammal died, a conservation official said Wednesday.

Curious onlookers crowded the shore of coastal Kupang city as officials scrambled to figure out what to do with the bloated carcass, which was first spotted on Tuesday.

But the giant creature was washed back to sea on Wednesday before it could be brought to shore for an examination.

""We think that it's a blue whale but we don't know what caused its death,"" said local conservation official Lidya Tesa Saputra.

""It looks like it didn't die here and may have been deceased for some time,"" she added.

Blue whales are the largest animals in existence, weighing up to 200 tons and growing as long as 32 metres.

The creature, whose tongue alone can weigh as much as an elephant, has an average lifespan of 80 to 90 years, according to National Geographic.

Seven pilot whales were found dead near Kupang last October.

Cross-currents off the beach pose a danger to whales as they can get caught between reefs close to shore.

In 2018, a sperm whale was found dead in Indonesia with more than 100 plastic cups and 25 plastic bags in its stomach, raising concerns about the Southeast Asian archipelago's massive marine rubbish problem.

89,89,FF-2020-000170-IDN,Explainer: How climate change is affecting wildfires around the world - Carbon Brief,https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-climate-change-is-affecting-wildfires-around-the-world,"This year has seen unprecedented wildfires cause havoc across the world. Australia recently battled its largest bushfire on record, while parts of the Arctic, the Amazon and central Asia have also experienced unusually severe blazes.

Since this article was first published, the western US has also faced intense fires, with the state of California experiencing its worst fire season since modern records began. The states of Oregon and Washington have also seen a spike in large wildfires in 2020.

It follows on from “the year rainforests burned” in 2019. Last year saw the Amazon face its third-largest fire on record, while intense blazes also raged in Indonesia, North America and Siberia, among other regions.

A rapid analysis released this year found that climate change made the conditions for Australia’s unprecedented 2019-20 bushfires at least 30% more likely. Further analysis – visualised below in an interactive map – has shown that, globally, climate change is driving an increase in the weather conditions that can stoke wildfires.

But despite a growing field of evidence suggesting that climate change is making the conditions for fire more likely, research finds that the total area burned by wildfires each year decreased by up to a quarter in the past two decades.

Understanding this paradox requires scientists to assess a vast range of influential factors, including climate change, human land-use and political and social motivations.

In this explainer, Carbon Brief examines how wildfires around the world are changing, the influence of global warming and how risks might multiply in the future.

When and where are most of the world’s wildfires?

At any given time, some part of the world is on fire. The map below, from the Global Forest Watch, shows where in the world has had a fire in the past 24 hours.

A “wildfire” can be defined as any type of uncontrolled fire that is spreading across wildland, including pastureland, forests, grasslands and peatlands. (Sometimes, fires are started intentionally and in a controlled manner, including during “prescribed burning”.)

Globally, wildfires have many impacts on humans, wildlife and the economy. Wildfires are a major driver of greenhouse gas emissions and are also responsible for 5-8% of the 3.3 million annual premature deaths from poor air quality, research suggests.

Some wildfires are started naturally, chiefly by lightning. The rest are started by humans, either accidentally or by arson.

Across the world, it is estimated that just 4% of fires start naturally. However, the proportion of human-started versus lightning-started fires varies widely from region to region. For example, in the US, 84% of fires are started by humans. However, in Canada, the majority (55%) of wildfires are started by lightning.

Many regions experience distinct wildfire seasons, driven by rainy and dry periods and human practices, such as agricultural burning. However, other regions have a risk of fire year-round.

The animation below, which uses data from NASA’s moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), shows where in the world wildfires occurred in each month of 2019.

The red, orange and yellow pixels on the maps show the locations where the satellite detected actively burning fires.

The colours represent a count of the number of fires observed within a 1,000-sq-km area. White pixels show as many as 30 fires in a 1,000-sq-km area per day. Orange pixels show as many as 10 fires, while red areas show as few as 1 fire in a day.

The animation shows how the average timing of fire seasons differs in different world regions.

North America, the Amazon, southern Africa and parts of Australia tend to see an uptick in fires from around August to late November. These months coincide with the height of the dry season in southern Africa and the Amazon.

By contrast, central Africa and parts of southeast Asia see most of their fires in December through to March. This coincides with the peak of the dry season in Africa’s Sahel region, which is north of the equator.

The year 2019 saw several large and – in some cases – unprecedented wildfires.

The UK had a record-breaking year in terms of total area burned by fire, with most its fires occurring in February to April. In June to July, more than 100 intense fires broke out across the Arctic Circle, mostly in Alaska and Siberia. August saw the Amazon battle its third-largest fires on record, while September saw large fires in North America and Indonesia. Towards the end of the year, Australia began to face its largest bushfires on record.

Australia’s unprecedented fire season continued into 2020, coming to a close at the end of March. The spring saw the return of fires to rural parts of the UK – likely boosted by an unusually hot winter, which left vegetation dry. The end of March also saw large fires break out in southwestern China, which killed at least 19 people and forced almost 25,000 more to evacuate.

From March to July this year, unprecedented heat in the Arctic fanned large “zombie fires” in Siberia. The fires ripped across vast stretches of permafrost, threatening the release of millions of tonnes of long-held carbon.

Several #Arctic locations recorded land surface temperatures hitting 45C on 19 June, according to initial data from the @esa satellite Sentinel-3.



Here is what you need to know… (THREAD 1/7) https://t.co/3Y7NW283Kn — Carbon Brief (@CarbonBrief) June 23, 2020

Analysis by Dr Mark Parrington, a senior wildfire scientist at the EU’s Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, has found that the Arctic fires seen in June 2020 were larger and more intense than those seen in June 2019. However, both the 2019 and 2020 Arctic fires are far above the average level seen in the region from 2003-18.

https://twitter.com/m_parrington/status/1278243686225190913

Reacting to the analysis, fellow wildfire researcher Dr Thomas Smith, from the London School of Economics, posted:

“Will 2019 & 2020 be considered extremes? Or are we seeing the beginning of a new regime?”

June 2020 also saw the return of large fires in the Amazon. This was several months before the region’s usual “fire season”, which typically runs from August to to October, says Dr Ane Alencar, director of science at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM) in Brazil. In June, she told a press briefing:

“I think it is very important and very worrisome to think about what is going to happen during this fire season.”

Fires in the Amazon remained unusually severe in July and hit a new high in August. In September, Unearthed reported that fires in Brazil’s Pantanal, the world’s largest wetland, had reached their highest level since records began in 1998.

At the same time, the western US entered into a record-breaking fire season. Since September, fires in California have been at their highest level on record – and the entire west coast is currently on track to see more land burned by fire in 2020 than in any other year since modern records began in the 1980s.

The gif below shows the cumulative area burned by fires across the west coast from 2000 to 2020. On the map, new area burned in each consecutive year is shown in red.

The US fires have killed at least 30 people and left millions suffering from unsafe air pollution from smoke across the west coast. The fires have also wiped out populations of endangered species, including half of Washington’s pygmy rabbit population, according to the New York Times.

Though fires happen all over the world, the largest and fastest-spreading fires mostly occur in sparsely populated grasslands in Australia, Africa and central Asia, according to NASA’s fire datasets.

The map below, put together by NASA, shows the average size of fires across the world from 2003-16. On the map, dark red spots indicate large fires.

Across all of the world’s grasslands, Africa sees a high number of large fires, explains Thailynn Munroe, a fire research analyst at the Global Forest Watch, an open-source forest monitoring service.

In fact, some researchers estimate that up to 70% of the world’s fires occur on the African continent. Munroe explains to Carbon Brief:

“Most of the fires that are started in Africa are for land-clearing and agriculture. A lot of it is either clearing for pastureland in sub-Saharan Africa or for agriculture in central Africa. I think that’s why we don’t see a lot of fires in Africa in the news because it’s more just part of the way of life there.”

The timing and whereabouts of fire is also influenced by the world’s major climate systems, such as El Niño, which periodically affects weather in many world regions, including southeast Asia and South America. Munroe explains:

“Fires in southeast Asia are greatly impacted by El Niño. In 2015-16, there was a really strong El Niño event which brought hot and dry weather. That was one of the reasons why Indonesia had such an intense fire season in that period.”

In 2015, Indonesia’s wildfires spiked, causing greenhouse gas release on the same scale as Brazil’s total annual emissions. The smoke from the fires led to 19 deaths and caused up to half a million people to suffer from respiratory illness, the Guardian reported. Fires in Indonesia have been worsened by the practice of draining peatlands.

How is climate change affecting wildfire risk?

There are several ways in which climate change can raise the risk of wildfires – and the importance of each of these factors varies from region to region, says Dr Cristina Santin, a wildfires researcher from Swansea University.

However, in general, one of the most important ways that climate change can increase the risk of severe fires is by causing vegetation to dry out, she says.

When temperatures are warmer than average, rates of evaporation increase, causing moisture to be drawn out from plants on the land. This drying can create “tinderbox conditions” – meaning that, if a fire is sparked, it can spread very quickly over large areas.

Similar conditions can also be created by long periods of drought, Santin tells Carbon Brief:

“In the fire community, we call vegetation that is available to burn ‘fuel’. If you have a forest, not all vegetation is considered fuel because, under normal circumstances, it’s not going to burn. But if you have a huge drought or heatwave, a lot of that vegetation will be very dry and, therefore, it will become fuel.”

Such conditions occurred during the 2018 northern hemisphere heatwave, which saw all-time temperature records broken across Europe, North America and Asia.

In the Attica region of Greece, wildfires ripped across large swathes of dry land at lightning speed, causing people to rush to nearby beaches and into the sea. (A study covered by Carbon Brief found that the 2018 northern-hemisphere heatwave would have been “impossible” without human-caused climate change.)

Sustained hot temperatures were also a major driver of Australia’s unprecedented 2019-20 bushfires, says Dr Friederike Otto, acting director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford.

Otto co-authored an analysis finding that temperatures during the bushfires were 1C to 2C hotter than they would have been in the early 20th century. She tells Carbon Brief:

“We found that climate change made the bushfires at least 30% more likely – and that is a conservative estimate. When we looked at temperatures alone, we found there has been a big increase in extreme temperatures in that region because of climate change.”

Warmer than average temperatures are also likely to be the primary driver of this year’s record-breaking fire season in the western US, the Atlantic reports.

As well as making fires more severe, warming temperatures are also making fire seasons longer in some regions, explains Dr Megan Kirchmeier-Young, a researcher of climate extremes at the Government of Canada. (Fire seasons are a stretch of a time when a particular region is most likely to see large and intense blazes.) She tells Carbon Brief:

“Climate change is affecting wildfires in two main ways. The first is an increase in the risk or the likelihood of wildfire. The second is longer fire seasons – and this is mostly coming from warming temperatures.”

A study published in 2015 found that, globally, the number of days where wildfires are likely to burn has risen as a result of climate change.

The influence of climate change on fire seasonality is especially pronounced in regions that have seasonal snow cover, including parts of North America and northern Europe, she explains:

“In some regions, especially in Canada, we also consider when we lose winter snow cover. With warming temperatures, that’s going to be happening earlier in the year and it will also be later in the year before we see cooler temperatures and the return of snow cover. So a longer fire season means more time of the year where you could have fires.”

Research led by Kirchmeier-Young found that Canada’s 2017 fire season, which saw a record 1.2m hectares of land burned, was driven by “extreme warm and dry conditions” heightened by climate change. The study estimated that the total area burned across the season was made seven to 11 times larger by climate change.

Further south, in California, a research paper published in 2020 found that the number of autumn days with weather suitable for wildfires has doubled since the 1980s as a result of climate change.

The lengthening of fire seasons in California has had a knock-on effect on plant “phenology” – the timing of key events in plants’ life cycle, says Dr Frank Lake, a fire ecologist for the United States Forest Service. He tells Carbon Brief:

“We have seen due to climatic change, often hotter, drier conditions in California. We’ve seen longer fire seasons, which has also affected plant phenology, and we have extended periods of drought. That has definitely dried out the fuels [vegetation] and increased fire activity.”

In the Amazon, human-caused climate change and shifts to how people use the land have worked in tandem to greatly increase the risk of wildfires, says Alencar. In June, she told a press briefing:

“Unlike some forests in California, Florida, or in Australia, the Amazon doesn’t burn naturally. The natural fire regime in the Amazon is said to be somewhere between 500 to 1,000 years. Our results have demonstrated that in some places in the Amazon, actually, that fire regime has changed to 12 years. So, an area that should burn naturally every 500 to 1,000 years is burning every 12.”

This year, Science Brief – a UK-based web platform run by a team of scientists – released a review of 73 scientific studies finding that climate change is increasing the risk of wildfires at a global level.

For the review, the scientists analysed all research papers published since 2013 that investigate the link between climate change and wildfires, either in a certain region or from a global perspective.

The researchers assessed how each study compared to the statement: “Climate change increases the risk of wildfires”.

Carbon Brief’s interactive map below includes each of the 73 studies, which are displayed according to what part of the world they focus on.

Studies that fully support the statement that climate change increases wildfire risk are represented with a dark red icon, studies that mostly support the statement are represented in dark orange and studies that inform the statement but do not fully support it are represented in light orange.

The map shows how the majority of the 73 studies published since 2013 looking into wildfires either fully or mostly support the statement that climate change is increasing the risk of wildfires.

It also shows that the vast majority of regional wildfire studies have been conducted in North America, Europe and Australia – with a visible lack of studies in the fire hotspots of central Africa and southeast Asia.

The review found strong evidence that climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires more likely, says Dr Matthew Jones, a senior researcher of fire emissions at the University of East Anglia and lead author of the analysis. He tells Carbon Brief:

“Our main focus in the ScienceBrief review was on fire weather and how it is impacted by climate change. We found unequivocal evidence – based on observations and models spanning key global regions – that anthropogenic climate change has increased the flammability of landscape fuels and placed upwards pressure on fire activity.”

Among the research analysed are several “attribution” studies. “Attribution” refers to a fast-growing field of climate science that aims to quantify the “fingerprint” of climate change on extreme-weather events, such as wildfires, heatwaves and floods. (Both Otto and Kirchmeier-Young’s studies are examples of attribution, for example.)

Analysis by Carbon Brief finds that, by the end of 2019, there had been 11 studies published that look into the role of climate change in single wildfire events. Out of these studies, 10 conclude that the fires analysed were made more likely or more severe by climate change.

However, it is worth noting that all of these studies were carried out in either North America or Australia – with, again, no research looking into the role of climate change in fire hotspots, such as central Africa or southeast Asia.

In addition, there have been relatively very few studies into the role of climate change in wildfires when compared to other extreme events.

The chart below shows the number of studies that have been conducted into different types of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, floods and extreme rainfall events and droughts, among others.

On the chart, colour indicates the proportion of studies that found climate change made the event more severe or more likely (red), less severe or less likely (yellow), where climate change had no effect (blue) and where there was insufficient data to draw conclusions (grey).

One reason why few wildfire attribution studies have been carried out is that fire risk is affected by multiple meteorological factors, says Kirchmeier-Young. These include temperature and rainfall, but also wind speed, which can influence the pace at which fires can spread, and soil moisture, which can influence the size of wildfires.

With so many different factors to consider, it can make it difficult to come up with a study framework that encompasses the whole picture of how climate change is affecting the probability and severity of a fire event, she says:

“Attribution generally requires you to define the event that you’re looking at. With a heatwave, you may look at maximum temperatures over a particular area, which you can easily get from a climate model. But with fire, there are a lot more variables that come into play – such as temperatures, precipitation levels, wind speed – and that can be a little more challenging.”

The complicated mix of factors affecting fire risk can also make it more difficult to source data, particularly in developing world regions, adds Otto:

“You can’t really do an attribution study if you don’t have decent observations. For fire, things like wind and soil moisture are also important, and in many parts of the world you have absolutely no observations for those variables.”

These challenges may have hampered efforts to carry out more wildfire attribution studies, Otto adds.

Are wildfires increasing across the globe?

With climate change raising the risk of hot and dry weather in many parts of the world, it may seem prudent to assume that the global area burned by wildfires each year is increasing.

However, several research papers looking into wildfires at a global level have come to the opposite conclusion. A paper published in the journal Science found that, globally, the area burned by wildfires decreased by 25% between 2003 and 2015.

The animation below, which uses data from the study, illustrates the pattern of how global area burned by wildfires changed over this time period.

The chart shows how the global burnt area zigzags throughout a year-long period. This is likely down to the influence of dry seasons and seasonal human practices, says Munroe. (For more information see: “When and where are most of the world’s wildfires?”)

However, despite peaks and troughs, an overall downward trend is seen until 2015. (And unpublished data from Global Forest Watch suggests that this downward trend continued up until 2020, Munroe says.)

There are several reasons why global burnt area could be decreasing at a global level despite the effect of warming, explains Santin, who co-authored a research paper looking into this paradox in 2016.

By far the most important factor is likely to be changes in how humans use the land, especially around the Sahel region of Africa, says Santin:

“It’s not all about climate change. We’ve seen a decrease in global burnt area in the last couple of decades and that is mostly because of land-use change. There are areas – mainly in Africa – that used to be savannah but, because of growing human populations, have been converted to agricultural, grazing and urban land.”

Savannah is a term for areas of grassland with sparse trees, which are typically found on the margins of the tropics. Such ecosystems cover half of Africa’s surface. For thousands of years, wildfires have been commonplace in African savannahs, with some native tree species evolving special characteristics in response to frequent fires, such as fire-resistant bark.

However, recent years have seen an increase in the conversion of savannah to agricultural land as nations seek to feed sub-Saharan Africa’s rapidly growing population. With less wild savannah left, sub-Saharan Africa has seen a decline in the number of large wildfires, says Santin.

The map below, which uses data from the Science study, illustrates how burnt area has shifted in different world regions from 2003-15. On the map, dark blue indicates a large percentage decrease in burnt area, where deep red indicates a large percentage increase.

The map features a wide blue band stretching across northern sub-Saharan countries from Senegal and the Gambia to Sudan and South Sudan, indicating percentage decreases in area burned by fire in this region. This is likely down to land conversion, says Santin.

Other decreases in burnt area, including in central South America, Madagascar and parts of southeast Asia may also be driven by the conversion of wildland to agricultural land, she adds.

The authors of the Science paper also attribute decreases in burnt area to the conversion of savannah to agricultural land. The scientists, led by Dr Niels Andela at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, write:

“A shift toward more capital-intensive agriculture has led to fewer and smaller fires, driven by population increases, socioeconomic development, and demand for agricultural products from regional and global markets.”

Decreases in developed parts of the world, including northern Australia, could be down to improved fire management techniques, adds Munroe.

In northern Australia, firefighters use “prescribed burning” – a technique pioneered by indigenous communities involving the burning of small patches of grassland early on in the dry season. This creates “fire breaks” in the landscape, which can prevent fires from quickly spreading over large areas of wildland.

In the US, there has been dispute over the relative degree to which forest management techniques and climate change have contributed to a recent surge in wildfires in regions such as California.

For centuries, Native Americans managed fire risk in woodlands using prescribed burning. However, the arrival of non-native settlers saw the use of prescribed burning decrease, causing the landscape to shift to being more dominated by trees over the past century. Lake, who is of indigenous American Indian descent, tells Carbon Brief:

“At the core of the understanding of indigenous knowledge is how to live with fire.”

A study published in Science in 2006 found that the accumulation of trees – also known as “fuel loading” – and human-caused climate change are both important factors in increased fire risk across the western US. Lake says:

“We’ve reached a tipping point. There’s too much fuel loading and it’s now too warm, the ability of ignition is greater with both lightning and human-set fires, and now we have these much larger and more extensive fires…Almost universally tribal elders have said this is something that is unprecedented in our cultural legacy of knowledge.”

It is also worth noting that human land-use change can greatly increase the area burned by wildfires.

For example, recent surges in deforestation in the Amazon have been linked to greatly increased fire activity. Alencar explains:

“Fires in the Amazon usually are the last stage of deforestation. It is the most inexpensive tool that people have to convert biomass into ashes so that [they can use the land] for some pasture fields.”

According to NASA scientists, the Amazon’s severe 2019 fire season was “more consistent with land clearing than with regional drought”.

“Slash-and-burn” clearing has also been linked to damaging peat fires in Indonesia.

Fires in the country have been exacerbated further by the practice of peatland draining. In order to grow palm oil and other crops, such as timber, peatlands are often drained of their natural moisture – leaving them dry and more likely to catch alight.

The influence of human land-use activity on global burnt area makes it an imperfect metric of how climate change is truly affecting wildfires, Prof Anthony Westerling a fire and drought researcher at the University of California, Merced, told Carbon Brief in 2018.

Another way that scientists could study the influence of climate change is by tracking fire severity.

Research published in 2017 analysed all “extreme wildfire events” from 2002-13 and found that 96% occurred during periods of hot and dry weather. (“Extreme wildfires” were deemed to be fires that caused serious economic or social damage.)

However, there is little research into how fire severity has changed at a global scale in recent decades. (A string of research papers have linked increasing fire severity in North America to climate change.)

How will wildfires change in the future?

Climate change will continue to drive temperature rise and more unpredictable rainfall in many parts of the world, meaning that the number of days with “fire weather” – conditions in which fires are likely to burn – is expected to increase in coming decades, says Kirchmeier-Young:

“As we continue to see increasing temperatures, we will continue to see an increase in the likelihood of wildfires. So, more days with increased fire risk, longer fire seasons.”

A study covered by Carbon Brief found that, by the middle of the century, there could be a 35% increase in the days with a high danger of fire across the world, on average – if little action is taken to tackle climate change.

The regions likely to see the highest increase in days with extreme fire weather in this very high emissions scenario (“RCP8.5”) include the western US, southeastern Australia, the Mediterranean and southern Africa, according to the study.

This is highlighted on the map below, which shows the projected change in the number of days with “high” fire danger from 2000-14 to the middle of the century (2014-70). The regions with the largest increase are shaded orange and red, while the areas with decreasing risk are shown in green.

Other studies have investigated how the risk of fire weather is likely to change in different world regions if the world does take action to tackle climate change.

Glossary RCP8.5: The RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) are scenarios of future concentrations of greenhouse gases and other forcings. Close The RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) are scenarios of future concentrations of greenhouse gases and other forcings. RCP8.5 is a “ very high baseline ” emission scenario brought about by rapid population growth, high energy demand, fossil fuel dominance and an absence of climate change policies. This scenario is the highest of the RCPs and sees atmospheric CO2 rise to around 935ppm by 2100, equivalent to 1,370ppm once other forcings are included (in CO2e). The likely range of global temperatures by 2100 for RCP8.5 is 4.0-6.1C above pre-industrial levels. The release of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) has introduced a number of additional “no-new-policy” scenarios, meaning RCP8.5 is no longer the sole option available to researchers as a high-end no-mitigation pathway.

For example, a study published in 2020 found that, in California, “climate change will further amplify the number of days with extreme fire weather by the end of this century”. However if efforts are taken to limit global warming to below 2C, which is the goal of the Paris Agreement, this “would substantially curb that increase”, the authors say.

In the Mediterranean, limiting global warming to 1.5C, which is the aspirational target of the Paris Agreement, could halve the total area burned by wildfires in the summer, when compared to a scenario where warming reaches 3C, according to a second study.

In Australia, days with fire weather akin to that seen during the 2019-2020 bushfires could become at least four times more likely under 2C of global warming, according to Otto’s recent analysis.

A landmark special report in 2018 from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded (pdf) that limiting global warming to 1.5C rather 2C would “reduce” the average wildfire risk worldwide.

However, though the risk of wildfires is likely to heighten in coming decades, it is not yet clear whether the area burned by wildfires will increase correspondingly, says Santin:

“It’s a complicated issue because it’s not only climate change controlling future fire risk, it’s also the interaction of humans and climate change.”

It is possible that efforts by humans to suppress wildfires could stem increases in the area burned by fire, despite the increased risk posed by climate change, she says.

However, it may be the case that, in some areas, the risks posed by climate change will become too large to overcome with adaptation measures, she adds:

“Something interesting that we’ve seen with the recent Australian fires is that, even in areas where efforts to suppress wildfires were undertaken, the fire conditions were so crazy – the temperatures so hot, the winds so strong – that the fires burned through every protective measure.”

Indeed, a research paper published in 2016 found that, globally, human efforts could suppress wildfire increases in the near future, but that these efforts may become ineffective later on in the century. The authors write:

“For future scenarios, global burnt area will continue to decline under a moderate emissions scenario…but start to increase again from around mid-century under high greenhouse gas emissions.”

After the Bihar floods, several parts of Assam have been hit by ongoing floods during to heavy rainfall. As per reports, over 48 lakh people across 30 districts have been impacted. Around 30 relief camps have been set up in order to provide aid amid this massive crisis.

In these trying times, BTS ARMY, fandom name for South Korean band BTS, have stepped up to raise funds. BTS' fanbase, BTS ARMY HELPS INDIA, raised over Rs. 5 lakhs within 24 hours. The campaign was the brainchild of Juhi Karekatte and Aakanksha Dutta and key members included Khachuk Debbarma, Divyanshi Tripathi, Athulya Nair, and Trisha Bhattacharya. A team of 30 members kickstarted the initiative. The donation link was closed at Rs. 5.8 lakhs on July 17.

Through this campaign, ARMY plans to provide shelter, clothes, and food including ""Rice, dal, flour, mustard oil, soyabean, biscuits"". The other part includes providing in sanitary napkins, masks, sanitizers.

Supporting the regional fanbases, big fanbases from India, and even abroad came together to highlight the crisis and spread awareness on their respective social media platforms on how people can donate by providing links.

This campaign kicked off after a fan tweeted about the devastating crisis in Assam. The tweet went viral that brought immense attention to the current situation of the state.

WHAT IS HAPPENING IN ASSAM & why isn't it getting the attention it deserves: An informative (short) thread and how you can help. — idk anymore⁷⟭⟬ (@MOONcheekies) July 16, 2020

Bollywood Hungama spoke the fanbase on Friday, July 17 after they crossed the mark of Rs. 5 lakhs. ""It all started on July 15th when a few individual accounts of Indian Army, fans of BTS, were really heartbroken over the devastating news of how badly Assam was affected by floods,"" they said. ""A native ARMY was contacted by one of the members who then suggested doing a collaboration with People For People, a fundraising organization. There was back and forth communication and sharing of ideas over only a few hours and this plan was then come up within the night of 15th July. We initially didn't expect many donations and kept a humble target of ₹30k when we started the donation drive at 1:30 pm on 16th July. We contacted ARMYs, big and small accounts, who promoted wholeheartedly.""

To donate And more detailed articles on what's going on, please take your time to read and help in anyway you can,

The people from assam and concerned indians will always be thankful for your time ????https://t.co/R7oJ7Algx2 — idk anymore⁷⟭⟬ (@MOONcheekies) July 16, 2020

""Soon after posting, the donation drive was rapidly gaining traction which surprised us all, with the amount raised rising exponentially. We were thrilled and shocked even but we kept our feet to the ground and kept increasing our targets little by little,"" they continued.

While their goal was to just reach Rs. 30,000, within six hours, it crossed a huge mark. ""Within 6 hours we had raised ₹2 lakhs already due to widespread support from the fandom of BTS, which is always excited about helping people and also the general public of India,"" said the fanbase. ""We made an e-card detailing all information about Assam Floods, posters with pictures and also created hashtags to trend to get the attention of both Indians and Non-Indians. By midnight, we had raised ₹3 lakhs already with the help from both ARMYs and the general public, and it hadn’t even been 12 hours yet.""

Speaking further about how it reached masses who began to help in the campaign, the fanbase said, ""Several hashtags created by us trended on Twitter, gaining support from the general public as it went viral on local twitter, resulting in the donation of generous amounts by the general public. We shared donation links wherever we could: Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp etc. and a lot of ARMYs contacted their friends and families too.""

""With immense help from the fandom and the kind ARMYs, who have always been as charitable as their favourite Korean group, BTS, we raised ₹5.8 Lakhs in 24 hours, an amount a lot higher than the initial target,"" said the fanbase who were overwhelmed by the response from not just fans but the locals too.

Thanking the BTS ARMY for genuine support and the general public for amplifying the links in order to spread to word, they further said, ""We honestly would not have been able to raise this much without the help from ARMYs and the general public. We are very grateful and look forward to carrying out more projects for India from our newfound fanbase, BTSARMYhelpsIndia which we created seeing the response. It is the need of the hour for the current generation to stand up for issues in the country and help India be a beautiful country that is, of course, by following the values BTS has taught us. It’s incredible how we all fell in love with BTS’s music and lyrics, which talks about self-love and tackles mental health and issues of youth. Thank you to BTS and the ARMY. Thank you to the population of India. We purple you.""

Hello! We have closed the donation link for Assam Flood Relief as the amount have exceeded the limit. The donations were closed at Rs. 5.8 Lakh. Thankyou so much for helping ???? — BTSARMY HELPS INDIA (@btshelpsindia) July 17, 2020

This isn't the first time BTS ARMY in India has stepped up for an important cause. (More on it soon).

The South Korean group BTS, easily the most popular band in the world, is known for their philanthropic work some of which is highlighted in media. Their fandom, ARMY, is arguably the biggest fanbase in the world. Not only they are known for breaking records, with their organized efforts, but they also plan several campaigns to help people impacted during the trying times.

BTS made a massive donation of $1million to Black Lives Matter with their parent company Big Hit Entertainment, back in June. Their fans decided to Match A Million after the group's donation and raised another million within 24 hours.

by FARA AISYAH/ pic by BLOOMBERG

THE Malaysian Palm Oil Council (MPOC) has revised the price outlook for palm oil in the year to a high of RM2,994 per metric tonne (MT) from a RM2,594 per MT announced last month.

CEO Datuk Dr Kalyana Sundram said the current price has already surpassed MPOC’s previous prediction.

“We are managing our local stocks pretty well. Malaysian palm oil output in 2020 is expected to reach 19.6MT, and the global stock usage ratio is about 14.68% (which indicates that price could further increase).

“As a result, we increased the price outlook going into next month. The average for the year is expected to be much higher compared to what we witnessed in 2019,” he said at the Market Recovery After Pandemic and Prospects of Further Growth webinar yesterday.

According to MPOC, the predicted high is achievable if Malaysia and Indonesia proceed with their implementation of biodiesel blending mandates as planned in 2020.

In addition, Indonesia recently launched its B100 on a trial basis. Other factors, including lower oilseed production which is anticipated in Europe in the coming season, are also expected to contribute to the increase.

MPOC’s outlook for the average price for the year is RM2,573 per MT from RM2,337 per MT previously, if the current scenario of production, consumption and demand remains unchanged.

The forecast low for 2020 is RM2,152 per MT from RM2,080 per MT last month, should there be a shift in market elements such as lower crude oil prices, political standoffs between global economic powers or a downturn in demand from major consuming countries, including India, China, the European Union (EU) and the US.

However, MPOC stated that market volatility will be a key factor as any change in fundamental factors will have a large impact on price.

Refinitiv senior analyst for Agriculture Research Dr Tan Kian Pang said the crude palm oil (CPO) futures are expected to test the RM2800 level by the end of this year due to many factors such as key export destinations, which are replenishing stocks and preparing for upcoming festivals.

“Malaysia’s lower CPO export prices versus Indonesia could boost more shipments for Malaysian palm oil.

“Indonesia’s determination to implement the B30 mandate, resumption of Malaysia’s B20 mandate in September and potential recovery in crude oil prices would be supportive of CPO prices,” he said during the webinar.

Tan said the impacts of prolonged dryness during 2019 to the first quarter of 2020, lower fertiliser application, labour shortage and flooding could lead to weaker production through October.

If verified, he said, CPO production would be lower than 19MT for 2019 to 2020.

He added that narrowing spread between soybean oil and palm oil may prompt some buyers to switch to soybean oil purchases.

Tan said concerns over the rising Covid-19 cases, global economic slowdown and the US-China trade war could weigh on the palm market.","Wed, 22 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/22TR005A1-1.jpg,"['lower', 'mpoc', 'prices', 'expected', 'revised', 'mt', 'higher', 'palm', 'outlook', 'price', 'production', 'oil', 'market']",

98,98,FF-2020-000170-IDN,Kweichow Moutai shares spill after Chinese state media attack - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Food-Beverage/Kweichow-Moutai-shares-spill-after-Chinese-state-media-attack,"HONG KONG -- Kweichow Moutai, the most valuable company listed in mainland China, took a hard spill on Thursday after coming under criticism by an affiliate of the Communist Party's flagship newspaper.

The state-owned white liquor producer, which just over three weeks ago overtook Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in market capitalization, dropped 7.9% in Shanghai trading to close at 1,614 yuan.

Kweichow Moutai's tumble helped drive down the overall Shanghai Composite Index by 4.5% though the market's decline accelerated after Beijing reported unexpectedly robust gross domestic product growth of 3.2% for the April-June quarter midmorning.

The data ""led to concerns China would begin to tighten liquidity,"" said Kenny Wen, market strategist at brokerage Everbright Sun Hung Kai. ""That along with the steady flow of news over the last few days through state media that authorities were looking to clamp down on speculation hurt investor appetite.""

One key exception Thursday was Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. The Chinese chipmaker's shares tripled in their debut on the Shanghai Stock Exchange's STAR Market, turning SMIC into the most valuable domestically listed tech stock and capping a 46.3 billion yuan ($6.62 billion) offering.

Until last Friday, most Chinese stocks were on a remarkable bull run too, few more than Kweichow Moutai.

A favorite of foreign investors buying through the Shanghai exchange's link with its Hong Kong peer, shares of the distiller from the underdeveloped southwestern province of Guizhou had climbed more than 80% from the low they touched in March amid the coronavirus pandemic-driven market meltdown. Kweichow Moutai's announcement in April that revenues had risen 13% and net profits 17% during January-March quarter added more fuel as most Chinese companies reported declines for the period.

The trigger for Kweichow Moutai's turn of fate was a widely shared article released overnight Wednesday by Xuexi Xiaozu, a new media platform under the wing of the People's Daily, entitled, ""Who is going to foot the bill for unpleasantly tasting Moutai?""

The story referred to corruption scandals involving former chairman Yuan Renguo who faces criminal charges alleging he improperly handed out distributor licenses and accepted bribes.

The article also criticized the widespread social custom of glorifying the value of the company's sorghum-based liquor, which has led to speculative trading at eye-watering prices and bottles given as bribes by those seeking favors.

""Alcohol itself is not to blame, it is the people's fault,"" the story said. Broadening its scope to competing liquor brands as well as niche products such as caterpillar fungus that have also been subject to speculative trading, the article said prices ""have to return to market value.""

""Liquor is something to drink, not to speculate on,"" it said. ""It is definitely not to use for corruption.""

Competitors of Kweichow Moutai fared even worse Thursday. Peers Anhui Kouzi Distillery, Sichuan Swellfun, and Jiuguijiu each fell by the daily limit of 10%.

Guosen Securities, a broker which had cheered Kweichow Moutai's rise, struck a new tone, issuing a report comparing the stock unfavorably with SMIC.

""SMIC is even more precious than Kweichow Moutai,"" given its advanced technology, the note said.

Despite Moutai's tumble, which brought down its market value by 170 billion yuan to 2.03 trillion yuan, its current market cap remains well above that of ICBC, China's largest bank.

The shares though may come under further pressure amid China's uncertain economic outlook.

Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura International in Hong Kong, said at a briefing Thursday that he sees ""a lot of negative headwinds"" for the second half of the year, including recent widespread flooding and the risk of more COVID-19 outbreaks.

A leakage was reportedly formed at the embankment under the sluice gate while four steel pipelines with 1000 mm in diameter were being laid. The embankment breakup started on the night of July 19, and it totally collapsed at about 2.30 am on July 20.

About 6,000 people from nearby villages were evacuated on July 20. Flooding then spread to three more villages on July 21 affecting 13,421 people in 3,386 households, according to figures from the township general administration department.

“We heard of such a project (of Shwege Sewage Pumping Station) in 2017. We were concerned about that. But they neglected us. Companies started earth work,” said U Aung from Hsinte village.

A local from Shwege Village also said: “The embankment collapse was caused by the recklessness of the project. It is due to their mismanagement. They are responsible for this. Now, the damage has been repaired. But I don’t think the troubled people will be OK. They have to struggle with their settlement.”

The flow of water from the Ayeyawady River has now been under control after repair. And authorities are trying to stop the flow completely.

Vice President Henry Van Thio visited the scene again and inspected repair work on July 21 morning.

Over 6,000 people are now staying at relief camps.

Situated in Shwege Village, the project is being implemented by Mandalay City Development Committee (MCDC).

The project started with a loan from Asian Development Bank at the place where the embankment broke up.

Mandalay Region Minister for Electricity, Energy and Construction Zarni Aung said an investigation would be launched into the incident.

According to Kyaw Hsan Myint, member of MCDC, the company based in China taking charge of the project has claimed its responsibility for the embankment collapse.

The Chinese-owned CEEC-HEPDI & CNOOD Company signed a contract worth US$5.56 million after winning the tender in 2018. The project started in December 2018.","Wed, 22 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://elevenmyanmar.com/sites/news-eleven.com/files/news-images/enbaank.jpg,"['sewage', 'villages', 'control', 'collapse', '13400', 'work', 'started', 'shwege', 'embankment', 'project', 'township', 'flood', 'water', 'amarapura', 'station', 'affected', 'ayeyawady', 'village']",
