MOGADISHU, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government on Monday donated 1.5 million U.S. dollars to assist Somalis affected by the raging floods that have displaced thousands of people across the Horn of Africa nation.

Qin Jian, the Chinese Ambassador to Somalia who handed over the donation in Mogadishu, said such gesture demonstrates the deep friendship and brotherhood of the Chinese people to the Somalis during the difficult times.

""The Chinese government has decided to provide 1.5 million dollars in cash to the Somalia government and people for humanitarian assistance to the Somali people affected by the floods,"" Qin said.

He said in January Beijing provided some 6 million dollars with 72 containers of assorted goods to the Somali government as part of humanitarian assistance to the country.

""We will provide further 1 million dollars worth of police uniform which will arrive in Somalia from China soon,"" he added.

Ahmed Isse Awad, Somali Minister of foreign Affairs, who received the cash donation, lauded the Chinese government for providing such important assistance, saying it arrived at very crucial time following an international appeal for assurance by the president.

""I thank the People's Republic of China for providing us this humanitarian assistance that came at the right time, we also thank Chinese Ambassador to Somalia for his active role here, ties between the two countries is deepening and we will expand areas of cooperation,"" Awad said.

5,5,FL-2018-000051-CHN,Don’t rely on China for data on the Brahmaputra - Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/don-t-rely-on-china-for-data-on-the-brahmaputra/story-2qOtRhfI1JM7hK70tOqjYN.html,"In March-end, China agreed to share the Brahmaputra river water data with India, which it had withheld last year after the Doklam stand-off. The 2,900-km-long Brahmaputra, with its headwater in Tibet, flows through China, India and Bangladesh before draining into the Bay of Bengal. As of now, India receives limited data on the river’s water level, discharge and rainfall amount from three upstream monitoring stations in Tibet, starting May 15 to October 15 every year. This data is then used by India’s Central Water Commission (CWC) to predict and prepare for floods that affect the Northeast during monsoons. The unavailability of data last year undermined the effectiveness of India’s flood early warning systems, leading to massive flood-related destruction in 29 districts of Assam. While data to India was denied on the pretext of ongoing upgrade of data-collection stations in Tibet, a BBC report claimed that China had given the same data to Bangladesh.

To secure the lives of its 3.5-billion population in the fragile ecosystem of Brahmaputra, India should seek to develop its own hydrological models for flood prediction, instead of relying on China. Scientific studies reveal that monitoring real-time rainfall data collected by satellites could help India with information on approximate river discharge, which would be sufficient to predict floods in real time. Although the information provided by upstream China would be more accurate, India could mitigate the risk of any flood-related disasters by putting in place improved flood monitoring systems. Moreover, India could save the Rs 8,200,000 it pays to China for the data.

One of the reasons for India’s dependence on China for flood prediction and warning is that the Brahmaputra basin is a data-scarce region with few and unevenly distributed hydrometeorological stations, estimating the flow generated in the river. Given the current geopolitical scenario, it is important for India to expedite the process of setting up of research facilities in the Northeast to develop the potential of geospatial technology, which includes information from Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing technologies for accurate and dynamic flood forecast warning systems.

Apart from the flood season data, non-monsoonal flow data of the river is equally critical for India. Recent reports suggested that China’s engineers are “testing techniques” to build the world’s longest 1,000-km tunnel to redirect the Brahmaputra’s flow from Tibet to its parched Xinjiang region. The hydrological data received from China does not reveal in detail the place and time they have been recorded, thereby limiting India’s scope in detecting any upstream diversion. Examining the river’s flow on a regular basis is imperative for India, rather than on annualised basis restricted to the flood season.

Besides water quantity, the deteriorating quality of the river is also a growing concern. In 2017, the sudden discolouration of the waters of River Siang (a tributary of Brahmaputra) was attributed to debris from China’s construction activity on the river. A hydrological and water quality model while creating a comprehensive and robust real-time map of pollutants and their respective sources would thereby help in effective monitoring of the problem.

However, executing these solutions would not be possible without a proper institutional mechanism in place. Setting up of a national mission on river Brahmaputra would play a pivotal role in formulating and implementing key action plans on disaster management, hydrological data monitoring as well as infrastructure development.

Unless India builds its own capabilities, China will continue to advance its control-capabilities, and, as has been witnessed recently, New Delhi will constantly remain vulnerable to Beijing’s strong-arm tactics.

CHENGDU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The first year in high school has been tough for Xiao Wei (a pseudonym): harder school work and stricter teachers. Fortunately, he has someone to talk to.

The boy from Ya'an City, southwest China's Sichuan Province, has regularly written to Chen Xing, a junior at Sichuan University, for two years under a pen pal program that was launched after a magnitude 8 earthquake devastated parts of the province in May 2008.

""At the beginning, 468 students from the Sichuan University volunteered to be pen pals of 610 students from nine primary and middle schools in the worst-hit areas, such as Beichuan County, to help relieve their trauma,"" said Professor Xiao Xu who initiated the campaign. ""In line with the calculation method of the World Health Organization, millions of people could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder caused by the quake, including hundreds of thousands of students.""

""For a long time, sorrow and depression were anywhere in the campus. Children were silent and sensitive, and teachers had no idea what to do,"" said Guo Xiujuan, a teacher with Beichuan Middle School. ""The letters from big brothers and sisters made them smile.""

The program, ""Colorful Stones,"" was named after a Chinese myth in which a goddess mends a broken heaven with colorful stones.

""We hoped to repair children's broken hearts, just like the goddess,"" Xiao said.

Even if pain inflicted by the disaster has long faded, the program has remained and expanded. Currently, more than 20,000 volunteers from several universities write to children in the province and neighboring Yunnan, Guizhou and Chongqing, offering psychological support and academic help.

""I still remember the first letter he [Xiao Wei] wrote to me. I read loneliness of a boy raised by his grandfather and lacking care from his parents,"" Chen said.

Encouraging Xiao Wei to work harder at school, Chen also reflects on herself: ""I often tell myself to be more proactive and positive. So I would say he and I are growing up together.""

The campaign epitomizes the bourgeoning volunteerism following the catastrophe. Official data showed that more than 1.18 million people applied to help with quake relief. The volunteers trooped into quake-hit areas on foot, bicycle and in their cars, giving anything they could toward those left homeless and grieving by the earthquake.

""The disaster prompted Chinese to unleash great power in volunteerism,"" said Wang Zhihao, an official with the Sichuan Committee of the Communist Youth League of China. ""Thereafter, China had a new type of volunteers called emergency volunteers.""

Right after the quake, Sichuan set up a team of certificated volunteers to respond to natural disasters. Now, the team has more than 5,000 members and consists of 10 contingents dedicated to respective fields, such as rescue, healthcare and psychological support.

""Over the past decade, volunteers and social organizations have thrived in Sichuan and become more professional facing disasters,"" Wang said.

Had not been a volunteer in Dujiangyan, one of the worst-hit areas, Li Jiahui, a graduate of civic engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University, would have been a building designer.

""It was my first time to work as a volunteer, and also the most unforgettable experience,"" said Li, an executive with a Sichuan-based poverty alleviation foundation. ""We transported water and food, set up tents, and cleaned up…I just couldn't stop doing things, or I would feel really bad.""

Back from the quake-hit region, Li rejected the design offer and started a one-year training for volunteers in Beijing, before obtaining a master degree in public relations in Singapore.

""The government has encouraged development of social organizations,"" Li said, adding that he believes the country will have more social workers.

The experience of being helped after the quake has also shaped the life of Du Cancan, then a student at Beichuan Middle School.

""[After the quake] My classmates and I were sent to a shelter …Volunteers were comforting us, holding our hands,"" Du said. ""I never knew their names. But I remember the warmth.""

Since then, she has been passionate about public welfare. After graduating from college in 2009, she co-founded a non-profit organization dedicated to assisting families in need and offering cultural services in communities in Chengdu.

The organization ""I You She"", with 212 full-time workers, has served more than 1,000 neighborhoods.

""Because of the disaster, I found the direction in my life,"" Du said.","Tue, 08 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",,"['xiao', 'li', 'university', 'quake', 'volunteerism', 'volunteers', 'sichuan', 'wei', 'work', 'social', 'school', 'xinhua', 'focus', 'thrives', 'china']",

""We could be looking at an additional 4 to 6 inches of rainfall between now and the start of the weekend.""

WASHINGTON — The worst is over, but the chance of flooding remains in Frederick County on Wednesday after flash floods inundated the area Tuesday night.

“We could be looking at some more flooding problems between now and the end of the workweek,” said Storm Team 4 meteorologist Matt Ritter. “We could be looking at an additional 4 to 6 inches of rainfall between now and the start of the weekend.”

With more rain in the forecast for Wednesday and the rest of the week, Ritter said the floodwaters will be slow to recede.

Parts of Frederick County got hit with as much of 6 inches of rain in the span of three hours on Tuesday night, Ritter said.

Police said water flooded some of the basements of residences and shops in the downtown area of Frederick.

More than 80 people were trapped aboard a MARC train that was stuck in the rising floodwaters until midnight. That led MARC canceling Brunswick rail service Wednesday, citing track damage between Brunswick and Germantown and between Monocacy and Point of Rocks on the Frederick Branch.

First responders made several water rescues as police were forced to close several roads in the area due to the flooding.

Michele Bowman of the Frederick City police Department said no one was hurt, though plenty of cars had to be towed out of the water.

“We were dealing with a lot of stranded motorists who found themselves in high water … When you’re driving on dark roads, it is hard to see,” Bowman said.

10,10,FL-2018-000051-CHN,Satellite Data Archives Reveal Unrecorded Himalayan Floods - Eos,https://eos.org/articles/satellite-data-archives-reveal-unrecorded-himalayan-floods,"A flood that tore through central Nepal in July 2016, destroying houses and roads, came from a seemingly placid source: a glacier. The Himalaya region encompasses thousands of glaciers, so glacial lake outburst floods like that summer 2016 torrent are a perennial problem. Glacial lake outburst floods occur when large bodies of glacial runoff water suddenly breach the fragile, naturally formed piles of rocks and other glacial debris, referred to as moraine dams, that held them in place. But monitoring these deluges using ground-based observations is often impractical because of challenging mountainous terrain and harsh weather conditions.

“It fills gaps in knowledge and understanding about glacial lake outburst floods occurrence in a region as vast as the Himalayas.” Now researchers have used satellite data spanning nearly 3 decades to assemble a census of glacial lake outburst floods across India, Nepal, Bhutan, and China. The team’s algorithm identified all but one of the region’s 11 previously reported floods as well as 10 previously undocumented events, observations that shed light on the prevalence of these unpredictable—and sometimes deadly—torrents.

“This work is very important,” said Christian Huggel, a geographer at the University of Zurich in Switzerland not involved in the research. “It fills gaps in knowledge and understanding about glacial lake outburst floods occurrence in a region as vast as the Himalayas.”

Unstable Lakes

Georg Veh, a geoscientist at the University of Potsdam in Germany, and his team looked for floods that had occurred in the Hindu Kush Himalayan mountain ranges, which run from Afghanistan in the west to Myanmar in the east. This region is home to a large fraction of the world’s roughly 200,000 glaciers, but these majestic ribbons of ice at Earth’s “third pole” are shrinking as global temperatures climb. Melting glaciers create thousands of lakes ringed by unstable debris that can give way at any moment and inundate villages, farmland, and important infrastructure like hydropower stations.

Veh and his collaborators used data from NASA’s Landsat series of satellites, which were first launched into near-Earth orbit in the 1970s and which reobserve locations on the planet roughly every 16 days. The team analyzed nearly 2,500 Landsat images encompassing roughly 10,000 square kilometers of the Hindu Kush Himalayan region that were captured between 1988 and 2016.

Not surprisingly, the team noted, those new-to-science glacial lake outburst floods tended to be smaller than their already-known brethren. Their use of a computer algorithm made to spot changes in patterns of pixels in the Landsat images that correspond to the shrinking of bodies of water led to their 91% success rate for already documented floods. The one known flood missed by the algorithm occurred in India in 2013.

Confident that their algorithm was effective at spotting real glacial lake outburst floods, Veh and his team then looked for signs of floods that hadn’t been previously reported. The 10 previously unknown floods that the scientists detected took place in China, Nepal, and Bhutan, the researchers reported in March in Remote Sensing of Environment.

By nearly doubling the known number of glacial lake outburst floods, the researchers assembled a more complete inventory of these events. Not surprisingly, the team noted, those new-to-science glacial lake outburst floods tended to be smaller than their already-known brethren.

Expanding the Survey

Veh and his colleagues are currently examining an even larger data set of Landsat images to extend their analysis to satellite observations from 2017. At the European Geosciences Union 2018 General Assembly held last month in Vienna, Austria, Veh and his colleagues presented their newest findings, an additional nine previously unreported floods.

This work, which will help local residents, government officials, and other concerned parties more accurately assess the risks that these floods pose, could be replicated in similar glacier-rich regions such as Alaska and Patagonia, the University of Zurich’s Huggel suggests.

Liu, 50, has been under house arrest in China since her late husband, the human rights activist Liu Xiaobo, was given the Nobel peace prize in 2010. Chinese authorities insist Liu “enjoys all freedoms in accordance with the law”, but supporters say her movements have been severely restricted and she lives under constant surveillance.

Liu Xiaobo, who championed non-violent resistance as a way of overcoming “forceful tyranny” in China, died of liver cancer in 2017 at the age of 61 after spending almost a quarter of his life in prison.

Last month, in a phone conversation with her friend the exiled writer Liao Yiwu, Liu said she herself was ready to die. “If I can’t leave, I’ll die in my home. Xiaobo is gone, and there’s nothing in the world for me now. It’s easier to die than live. Using death to defy could not be any simpler for me … If I’m dead, it’ll all be done with.” Liao posted a recording of the conversation online, on which Liu is heard crying for minutes at a time.

Activists have repeatedly called for the release of Liu, who has never been accused or convicted of any crime. Now, big-name writers including Auster, Nobel laureate Coetzee, The Lovely Bones author Sebold, The Kite Runner author Hosseini, author Michael Chabon, Pulitzer-winning poet Rita Dove and the Chinese author Hu Ping have issued a public display of solidarity with the imprisoned writer.



Reading excerpts from Liu’s poetry in a video made for Amnesty International, the authors are calling for the lifting of all restrictions on her movements. “Artists who are free to speak must do so on behalf of other artists whose voices are being stifled,” said Hosseini.

Today, writers and artists come together for one of their own. @khaledhosseini, @PGourevitch, Siri Hustvedt, and Rita Dove read Liu Xia’s poem ""June 2, 1989."" They—and we—won’t stop calling for her release until she is truly free. @amnesty #FreeLiuXia https://t.co/yqC5MIQGiN pic.twitter.com/gNMpnWvjZX — PEN America (@PENamerican) May 16, 2018

PEN America’s chief executive Suzanne Nossel said the Chinese government’s claim that Liu “enjoys all freedoms in accordance with the law” was hollow.

“As efforts to allow [her] to travel abroad for medical treatment stall, literary and human rights communities renew and amplify their call to release a poet who has been accused of no crime,” said Nossel. “We are proud to stand with Liu Xia’s literary peers to celebrate her work and challenge the Chinese government’s relentless campaign to erase her voice.”

Amnesty International’s East Asia campaigns director Lisa Tassi called the Chinese government’s “efforts to silence” Liu “despicably cruel … Liu Xia’s poetry inspires so many who are now united in calling for her to be free.”","Wed, 16 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/608976bfe330adfabd2441420251650ca226ed5e/0_28_2364_1418/master/2364.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=61b6dacc691f73d8371a7fa359d97faa,"['coetzee', 'chinese', 'jm', 'release', 'xias', 'poet', 'paul', 'xia', 'liu', 'writers', 'xiaobo', 'author', 'free', 'poets', 'renewed', 'lead', 'governments']",

Water burst through the banks of the Patel Dam in Kenya’s Rift Valley, about 150km north of the capital Nairobi, on Wednesday night, washing away almost an entire village.

With the death toll expected to rise, according to officials, rescuers continued their search for survivors on Friday.

“The area of search is a long stretch from the dam area downstream,” Pius Masaai, spokesman for the National Disaster Unit, said.

“We are also looking for the families of those missing and we have opened a tracing desk,” he told Al Jazeera.

Extent of the damage

According to Kenya’s Red Cross, which along with the Nakura County disaster management teams rescued 41 people from under the mud on Thursday, close to 500 families have been displaced from the disaster in Solai town and the expansive Nyakinyua Farm.

“These families will need long-term assistance by both government and other humanitarian players,” said Abbas Gullet, Secretary-General of the Kenya Red Cross, in a statement.

More than 20 of those found dead were children, according to sources at the Nakura County Health Ministry.

“Some of the pictures we’ve seen so far, we can’t broadcast, but children, who are the weakest are the major victims in all of this,” said Al Jazeera’s Andrew Simmon, reporting from nearby Dadaab in Garissa County.

Victims and survivors came back to assess the extent of the damage to their homes and search for relatives.

“It was a sea of water. My neighbour was killed when the water smashed through the wall of his house. He was blind, so he could not run. They found his body in the morning,” said Veronica Wanjiku Ngigi.

“My other neighbours also died. All our houses have been ruined,” the 67-year-old survivor told Reuters news agency.

Charles Kimono lost his 50-year-old sister Nancy Muna on Wednesday.

“We heard about the flooding, came to look for my sister; we looked everywhere,” he told Al Jazeera. “We only found her body hours after the water receded.”

Bernard Mankato, who works at a village clinic, tried in vain to clear the debris.

“I lived here with my colleagues, there were many houses around us and this is where many people were swept away,” he told Al Jazeera.

Safety standards

Patel Dam is one of seven dams in the region owned by a private farm.

Its main purpose was to irrigate the large flower farm, which also exports macadamian nuts, coffee, fruits and other crops.

Kenya’s public prosecutor has ordered the chief of police to launch an investigation into the accident and submit a written interim report within two weeks.

After the disaster on Wednesday, other dams in the region are now also being assessed.

The farm was subject to investigation, deemed unsafe and ordered to close by the water resources authority, according to local media reports, Al Jazeera’s Simmons said.

“Local people were against this reservoir being built in the first place because of the safety standards,” he added.

Heavy seasonal rains and flooding since March have led to the deaths of 158 people with 80 injuries recorded countrywide, the Red Cross said.

“This tragedy has really brought it home how dangerous the continuing rainfall is for Kenyans right across the country,” said Al Jazeera’s Simmons.

“The heavy rains are the worst for two decades and it proves beyond all reasonable doubt that the infrastructure of this country simply can’t cope,” he added.

The floods to date have left more than 225,000 displaced, according to the government.

“The effects of the floods countrywide has now reached a proportion of a national disaster and its severity will be seen when the rains are over,” said Gullet of Red Cross.","Fri, 11 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2283bda2b64d41078d9d65d73f5b13cb_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['told', 'deadly', 'collapse', 'according', 'survivors', 'search', 'al', 'dam', 'water', 'rains', 'disaster', 'red', 'cross', 'kenya']",

City Hall has rolled out preventative measures against flooding in Bangkok as heavy rains have been forecast during the forthcoming rainy season this month by the Thai Meteorological Department (TMD).

Narong Ruangsri, deputy director of the Department of Drainage and Sewerage, said Sunday the measures were devised following the latest warning of the TMD.

According to the TMD, the upper part of Thailand, including Bangkok, will experience heavy rains and thunderstorms from Wednesday until Friday due to a high-pressure system from China while some parts of the southern region will face downpours from Monday through Thursday.

City Hall workers will dredge roadside ditches and clean drainage facilities as well as remove rubbish and weeds blocking water flow so they can absorb and discharge rainwater to natural watercourses including the Chao Phraya River, as preparations step up.

Maintenance will be performed on water pump stations in preparation to handle an influx of floodwater.

Mr Narong said City Hall instructed contractors to speed up the construction of water pipelines for flood control works underground in several locations such as Song Sawat, Yaowarat, Charoen Krung, Narathiwat Ratchanakharin and Suan Phlu Roads.

Mr Narong also sought cooperation from the public not to throw garbage into local waterways as it would block water flow.","Mon, 07 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20180507/c1_1459669_180507054805_700.jpg,"['system', 'heavy', 'measures', 'flow', 'braces', 'rainfall', 'water', 'hall', 'rains', 'narong', 'bangkok', 'flooding', 'including']",

Flash floods caused by heavy rain have wreaked havoc in Ankara.

The heavy downpours occurred in the Mamak district of the Turkish capital on Saturday, injuring six people, according to state-run Anadolu news agency.

There were dramatic scenes of drivers trying to escape from their vehicles and several cars being swept down the street by flood waters.

Municipality workers rushed to the scene to pull out stranded motorists. Dozens of vehicles were damaged and many shops were flooded.

Ankara’s Mayor Mustafa Tuna said it was “a natural disaster like never before”.

A Turkish official explained that the rain was expected to last three hours on Saturday afternoon. It came down in just nine minutes, causing the flash flooding.

Turkey‘s labour and social security minister said six people were injured in the floods, which damaged more than 160 cars and 25 businesses. The minister said the government was working to assess and alleviate the damage.

Footage showed cars and trucks being swept away in the floods. One man escaped being submerged by climbing on top of a car caught in the flood.

JAKARTA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Passing through the mountains in Indonesia's West Java province, a silver ""dragon"" appears in front of us. This, is the Cimanuk River, cradle and ""mother river"" of West Java people.

The river brings life and water to local people, as well as flood during monsoon seasons and drought during dry seasons. For more than half a century, the Indonesian government and people have been making plans to build a dam to tame the Cimanuk River, but all in vain due to fund and technical reasons.

Things were changed in 2007. In that year, China's Sinohydro Cooperation signed a contract with the Indonesian government on the construction of the Jatigede Dam, with 90 percent of the fund coming from a loan from the Export-Import Bank of China, and 10 percent appropriated by the Indonesian government.

After eight years of hard work, in August 2015, the Jatigede Dam was completed against all odds and started to function. The Jatigede hydropower station project was also initiated in the same year with an anticipated installed capacity of 110,000 kw and expected to be commissioned in 2019. Once starting to generate electricity, the power station will greatly relieve the electricity shortage situation in the West Java region.

With a height of 110 meters and length of 1,670 meters, the Jatigede Dam stretches across two mountains in Sumedang Regency, West Java, with a total storage capacity of 1.063 billion cubic meters and irrigation area of 90,000 hectares of farmland. Not only does it protect the region from being flooded by the Cimanuk River, the dam also serves as the heart of irrigation, power generation, fishing and sight-seeing.

""The smooth construction and function of the Jatigede Dam have energized the economic development of the region, improved the livelihoods of local people, thus earning high recognition and praise from Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Indonesia in 2013 as well as from the Indonesian government, experts and local people,"" Jatigede Dam Site Construction Manager Zhang Lin told Xinhua.

In Kudajaya village, just one km from the dam, Xinhua reporters met Asep Tatang Rukmana, a local employee of the dam project. The 32-year-old used to work at a bread factory in another regency, ever since he joined Sinohydro Cooperation in 2007 as a surveyor, his life took a leap.

""Only after two years working for Sinohydro, I bought a shop with my salary savings,"" said Asep, smiling. ""Now I work as a senior surveyor of Sinohydro's Jatigede Dam project, and my wife works at the shop while taking care of our kids, the business is very good.""

""My Chinese colleagues are very professional, very hardworking, and are always generous enough to share their expertise with me. I've learned so much from them.""

""I really enjoy my life now,"" Asep said.

Beben Nariespendi, chief of Kudajaya village, said before the Jatigede Dam project, the region was like a marginalized primitive jungle. During the past 10 years, the village has become increasingly modernized, with trade activities getting active, roads emerging, tap water and electricity being supplied to villagers' households.

The construction of the dam has also created thousands of direct and indirect job opportunities for villagers, training them to become professional construction workers and increasing their income.

""Although the dam occupies some of our farmland, but from a longer perspective, the dam brings us water, electricity and tourists, and helps attract investment,"" said Beben. ""According to government plans, we are going to have commercial, agricultural, industrial and tourism zones in the region. I can't wait to see them.""

While inspecting the Jatigede Dam in March, 2016, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said that since its planning in the 1960s, the Jatigede Dam had finally been completed after so many years.

As Indonesia's second largest dam, the Jatigede Dam would irrigate 90,000 hectares of farmland, and also serve as a tourism destination and a fishing area. The hydropower station nearby would supply electricity to the local vast area, the president said.","Mon, 07 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",,"['chinese', 'feature', 'local', 'electricity', 'sinohydro', 'indonesians', 'friendship', 'irrigating', 'flower', 'jatigede', 'dam', 'xinhua', 'west', 'river', 'construction', 'java', 'indonesian']",

The plan to build a massive hydropower dam in Sumatra as part of China’s immense Belt and Road Initiative threatens the habitat of the rarest ape in the world, which has only 800 remaining members.

This is merely the beginning of an avalanche of environmental crises and broader social and economic risks that will be provoked by the BRI scheme.

The orangutan’s story began in November 2017, when scientists made a stunning announcement: they had discovered a seventh species of Great Ape, called the Tapanuli Orangutan, in a remote corner of Sumatra, Indonesia.

In an article published in Current Biology today, my colleagues and I show that this ape is perilously close to extinction – and that a Chinese-sponsored megaproject could be the final nail in its coffin.

Ambitious but ‘nightmarishly complicated’

The BRI is an ambitious but nightmarishly complicated venture, and far less organised than many believe. The hundreds of road, port, rail, and energy projects will ultimately span some 70 nations across Asia, Africa, Europe and the Pacific region. It will link those nations economically and often geopolitically to China, while catalysing sweeping expansion of land-use and extractive industries, and will have myriad knock-on effects.

Up to 2015, the hundreds of BRI projects were reviewed by the powerful National Development and Reform Commission, which is directly under China’s State Council. Many observers have assumed that the NDRC will help coordinate the projects, but the only real leverage they have is over projects funded by the big Chinese policy banks – the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China – which they directly control.

China’s Belt & Road Initiative will sweep across some 70 nations in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Pacific region. Mercator Institute for China Studies

Most big projects – many of which are cross-national – will have a mix of funding from various sources and nations, meaning that no single entity will be in charge or ultimately responsible. An informed colleague in China describes this model as “anarchy”.

Tapanuli orangutan

The dangerous potential of the BRI becomes apparent when one examines the Tapanuli orangutan. With fewer than 800 individuals, it is one of the rarest animals on Earth. It survives in just a speck of rainforest, less than a tenth the size of Sydney, that is being eroded by illegal deforestation, logging, and poaching.

All of these threats propagate around roads. When a new road appears, the ape usually disappears, along with many other rare species sharing its habitat, such as Hornbills and the endangered Sumatran Tiger.

The most imminent threat to the ape is a US$1.6 billion hydropower project that Sinohydro (China’s state-owned hydroelectric corporation) intends to build with funding from the Bank of China and other Chinese financiers. If the project proceeds as planned, it will flood the heart of the ape’s habitat and crisscross the remainder with many new roads and powerline clearings.

It’s a recipe for ecological Armageddon for one of our closest living relatives. Other major lenders such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank aren’t touching the project, but that isn’t slowing down China’s developers.

What environmental safeguards?

China has produced a small flood of documents describing sustainable lending principles for its banks and broad environmental and social safeguards for the BRI, but I believe many of these documents are mere paper tigers or “greenwashing” designed to quell anxieties.

According to insiders, a heated debate in Beijing right now revolves around eco-safeguards for the BRI. Big corporations (with international ambitions and assets that overseas courts can confiscate) want clear guidelines to minimise their liability. Smaller companies, of which there are many, want the weakest standards possible.

The argument isn’t settled yet, but it’s clear that the Chinese government doesn’t want to exclude its thousands of smaller companies from the potential BRI riches. Most likely, it will do what it has in the past: issue lofty guidelines that a few Chinese companies will attempt to abide by, but that most will ignore.

The Greater Leuser Ecosystem in northern Sumatra is the last place on Earth where Orangutans, Tigers, Elephants and Rhinos still persist together.

Stacked deck

There are three alarming realities about China, of special relevance to the BRI.

First, China’s explosive economic growth has arisen from giving its overseas corporations and financiers enormous freedom. Opportunism, graft and corruption are embedded, and they are unlikely to yield economically, socially or environmentally equitable development for their host nations. I detailed many of these specifics in an article published by Yale University last year.

Second, China is experiencing a perfect storm of trends that ensures the harsher realities of the BRI are not publicly aired or even understood in China. China has a notoriously closed domestic media – ranked near the bottom in press freedom globally – that is intolerant of government criticism.

Beyond this, the BRI is the signature enterprise of President Xi Jinping, who has become the de-facto ruler of China for life. Thanks to President Xi, the BRI is now formally enshrined in the constitution of China’s Communist Party, making it a crime for any Chinese national to criticise the program. This has had an obvious chilling effect on public discourse. Indeed, I have had Chinese colleagues withdraw as coauthors of scientific papers that were even mildly critical of the BRI.

Third, China is becoming increasingly heavy-handed internationally, willing to overtly bully or covertly pull strings to achieve its objectives. Professor Clive Hamilton of Charles Sturt University has warned that Australia has become a target for Chinese attempts to stifle criticism.

Remember the ape

It is time for a clarion call for greater caution. While led by China, the BRI will also involve large financial commitments from more than 60 nations that are parties to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, including Australia and many other Western nations.

We all have a giant stake in the Belt and Road Initiative. It will bring sizeable economic gains for some, but in nearly 40 years of working internationally, I have never seen a program that raises more red flags.

22,22,FL-2018-000051-CHN,Flood gates could open on US drone sales to the Middle East - DefenseNews.com,https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/sofex/2018/05/11/us-drone-sales-could-heat-up-in-the-middle-east/,"This isn't an MQ-9 Reaper. It's a Chinese-made CH-4 that is owned by Jordan.

AMMAN, Jordan — U.S. drone sales could heat up in the Middle East as the Trump Administration moves to relax unmanned aircraft export policies abroad for non-NATO countries.

And while Jordan prominently displayed one of its Chinese drones that looks eerily similar to a Reaper unmanned aircraft system right next to its new colossal Russian-made Mi-26 Halo cargo helicopter at the Special Operations Exposition here, General Atomics came to the expo with a message to Middle Eastern countries that its unmanned aircraft systems are best suited to accomplish mission sets important in regional operations.

Because it’s been essentially impossible to buy larger drones with laser-designator technology by foreign countries in the Gulf region, area countries have turned to Chinese and Russian technology. Chinese drones are dominant in the Middle East because they are less expensive and there are no buying restrictions.

General Atomics has been able to sell its MQ-1 Predator UAS to NATO countries like the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Italy, but has only sold an exportable version of Predator approved for the Middle East and North Africa to the United Arab Emirates so far, Jim Thomson, company regional vice president of international strategic development in the Middle East, North Africa and the Americas, told Defense News at SOFEX this week.

The company had to design an exportable version in order to sell it in the region due to previous Foreign Military Sales (FMS) restrictions on drones under the Obama Administration.

But with the new policies emerging under President Trump, General Atomics has been advising potential customers around the world, including the Middle East, to go ahead and start asking the U.S. government to buy drones they’ve been eyeing, Thomson said.

The U.S. government will still handle each potential drone sale on a case-by-case basis as it does all FMS, but now there’s a much higher chance of an approval, Thomson said.

Another aspect of the policy opens up the opportunity for companies to sell systems via direct commercial sale, where a company and another country can directly negotiate a deal, eliminating the longer process of using the U.S. government as a middle man.

The policy still has to flesh out, and there’s a 60-day period for industry to provide feedback on the draft, but Thomson believes the crux of the policy will remain and there’s no harm in starting the request process while the policy fleshes out, he advised.

But now that it may be easier for U.S. companies to sell drones globally, industry has to make a case to countries with Chinese and Russian systems that the capability U.S. companies bring to the table is a better deal.

For General Atomics, the cherry on top for Middle East customers is the ability for the company’s UAS to team with manned aircraft and the fact it offers an end-to-end solution from the aircraft, to the ground control, to software and even a system that helps with data dissemination, Thomson said.

General Atomics pioneered manned-unmanned teaming with the U.S. Army early on, pairing its Gray Eagle UAS with AH-64 Apache attack helicopters to fill a gap in armed reconnaissance capability left open when the service retired its OH-58 Kiowa Warrior helicopters.

The systems are designed to pass imagery into the cockpit and give the pilot the ability to control the UAS’ payload. The pilot could also be capable of controlling the entire UAS, but operationally the service hasn’t been big on the idea.

General Atomics has approval to provide MUM-T capability to Gulf countries through FMS, Thomson said.

And Middle East countries want the capability.

“That is a benefit we have over the others like the Chinese or foreign suppliers because the waveforms have to be compatible, you have to have the right waveform for them to receive and transmit and those are U.S. waveforms,” Thomson said.

Additionally, the capability allows helicopters going out to the forward edge of the battles space without satellite connection to stay connected to home base through, for example, a satellite data link-connected Predator that can relay voice communications back to base, according to Thomson.

Predator also has a loiter capability of 35 hours, Thomson said, while helicopters can stay aloft in a mission for roughly four and a half hours.

This means the capability would be especially useful for maritime patrol missions in the Gulf region.

General Atomics has received quite a few requests from Middle Eastern countries expressing interest in the MQ-9B Guardian, which is a maritime patrol UAS that has a maritime radar in the belly of the aircraft, Thomson said.

Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE and Morocco all have maritime missions where it would be ideal to replace an expensive manned aircraft with an unmanned system, particularly because the job can be tedious and long to run patrols.

“I think that will be the first domino to fall will be a maritime Predator for one of these countries,” Thomson said, “and then from there we will see.”

Thomson believes the trend is usually for countries that operate drones through their air forces to pick U.S. Air Force drones so there will be a continued market for Predators and Reapers.

But he said Middle Eastern countries that came to the Army Aviation Association of America conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last month, are watching what the U.S. Army is doing with MUM-T and Gray Eagle and “they are seeing the benefits of manned-unmanned teaming that the U.S. Army has pretty much developed,” Thomson said, adding he has not seen other countries with such an ability.","Fri, 11 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/1Kd6N2r1lfUfQcl56FcHclNZTI0=/1200x630/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-mco.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BBJ3NZFG45GJNJKVIMU4MXUUPU.jpg,"['atomics', 'flood', 'uas', 'east', 'thomson', 'drones', 'maritime', 'aircraft', 'gates', 'countries', 'open', 'drone', 'sales', 'middle', 'capability']",

In Kenya, floods have displaced over 260,000 people and killed 100 others in at least 15 of the country’s 47 counties, according to the United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs. The floods, which have also affected refugees in northeastern Kenya’s Dadaab camp, have damaged businesses, swept away homes and food supplies, closed more than 200 schools, destroyed community water points, and increased chances of disease outbreaks including cholera and malaria. The situation was so dire Facebook activated a safety feature this week asking users to indicate if they were safe.

In Somalia, 500,000 people were affected by the floods, prompting the government to ask for international assistance, and pushing African Union peacekeepers to relocate hundreds of people to safer grounds.

The flooding comes as many countries are just recovering from the devastating drought and famine that swept the Horn and East Africa region in the last two years. The drought, exacerbated by El Nino, curtailed crop production in Kenya, drove food prices higher, increased inflation, and put a strain on economic growth. It also forced over 1.3 million Somalis to leave their homes last year, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council.

The current torrents show the poor planning and the lack of disaster preparedness among governments in the region. As such, countries experience a vicious cycle that alternates between droughts and floods, reacting to events instead of being proactive about attaining solutions.

In the aftermath of rains, for instance, roads are deemed impassable, drainage systems clog, transport networks break down, and rivers burst their banks blocking any humanitarian efforts. Both climatic conditions also exacerbate hunger and poverty, especially among pastoralists, who lose their herds for lack of water during dry periods and are swept away when it pours.

Africa is extremely vulnerable to the impact of climate change compared to other continents. Even while emitting a small number of greenhouse gases, the continent is experiencing droughts, heatwaves, floods, and rising sea levels more frequently. To manage this challenge would require countries to invest in strategic approaches that would understand shortcomings, collaborate with research institutions to better understand climate phenomena, and create models that that would help prepare for and reduce the effects of disasters.

These are efforts and plans better started now—since the rains, at least this time, are not abating anytime soon.","Sat, 05 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/h_00893521-e1525524953454.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['humanitarian', 'africas', 'rains', 'understand', 'stark', 'east', 'deadly', 'region', 'regions', 'countries', 'water', 'disaster', 'lack', 'swept', 'floods', 'reminder', 'poor', 'preparedness', 'service']",

The orangutan’s story began in November 2017, when scientists made a stunning announcement: they had discovered a seventh species of Great Ape, called the Tapanuli Orangutan, in a remote corner of Sumatra, Indonesia.

In an article published in Current Biology today, my colleagues and I show that this ape is perilously close to extinction – and that a Chinese-sponsored megaproject could be the final nail in its coffin.

Sumatran Orangutan Society

Ambitious but ‘nightmarishly complicated’

The BRI is an ambitious but nightmarishly complicated venture, and far less organised than many believe. The hundreds of road, port, rail, and energy projects will ultimately span some 70 nations across Asia, Africa, Europe and the Pacific region. It will link those nations economically and often geopolitically to China, while catalysing sweeping expansion of land-use and extractive industries, and will have myriad knock-on effects.

Up to 2015, the hundreds of BRI projects were reviewed by the powerful National Development and Reform Commission, which is directly under China’s State Council. Many observers have assumed that the NDRC will help coordinate the projects, but the only real leverage they have is over projects funded by the big Chinese policy banks – the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China – which they directly control.



Mercator Institute for China Studies

Most big projects – many of which are cross-national – will have a mix of funding from various sources and nations, meaning that no single entity will be in charge or ultimately responsible. An informed colleague in China describes this model as “anarchy”.

Tapanuli Orangutan

The dangerous potential of the BRI becomes apparent when one examines the Tapanuli Orangutan. With fewer than 800 individuals, it is one of the rarest animals on Earth. It survives in just a speck of rainforest, less than a tenth the size of Sydney, that is being eroded by illegal deforestation, logging, and poaching.

All of these threats propagate around roads. When a new road appears, the ape usually disappears, along with many other rare species sharing its habitat, such as Hornbills and the endangered Sumatran Tiger.

Maxime Aliaga

The most imminent threat to the ape is a US$1.6 billion hydropower project that Sinohydro (China’s state-owned hydroelectric corporation) intends to build with funding from the Bank of China and other Chinese financiers. If the project proceeds as planned, it will flood the heart of the ape’s habitat and crisscross the remainder with many new roads and powerline clearings.

It’s a recipe for ecological Armageddon for one of our closest living relatives. Other major lenders such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank aren’t touching the project, but that isn’t slowing down China’s developers.

What environmental safeguards?

China has produced a small flood of documents describing sustainable lending principles for its banks and broad environmental and social safeguards for the BRI, but I believe many of these documents are mere paper tigers or “greenwashing” designed to quell anxieties.

According to insiders, a heated debate in Beijing right now revolves around eco-safeguards for the BRI. Big corporations (with international ambitions and assets that overseas courts can confiscate) want clear guidelines to minimise their liability. Smaller companies, of which there are many, want the weakest standards possible.

The argument isn’t settled yet, but it’s clear that the Chinese government doesn’t want to exclude its thousands of smaller companies from the potential BRI riches. Most likely, it will do what it has in the past: issue lofty guidelines that a few Chinese companies will attempt to abide by, but that most will ignore.

Stacked deck

There are three alarming realities about China, of special relevance to the BRI.

First, China’s explosive economic growth has arisen from giving its overseas corporations and financiers enormous freedom. Opportunism, graft and corruption are embedded, and they are unlikely to yield economically, socially or environmentally equitable development for their host nations. I detailed many of these specifics in an article published by Yale University last year.

Second, China is experiencing a perfect storm of trends that ensures the harsher realities of the BRI are not publicly aired or even understood in China. China has a notoriously closed domestic media – ranked near the bottom in press freedom globally – that is intolerant of government criticism.

Beyond this, the BRI is the signature enterprise of President Xi Jinping, who has become the de-facto ruler of China for life. Thanks to President Xi, the BRI is now formally enshrined in the constitution of China’s Communist Party, making it a crime for any Chinese national to criticise the program. This has had an obvious chilling effect on public discourse. Indeed, I have had Chinese colleagues withdraw as coauthors of scientific papers that were even mildly critical of the BRI.

Foreign Policy Journal

Third, China is becoming increasingly heavy-handed internationally, willing to overtly bully or covertly pull strings to achieve its objectives. Professor Clive Hamilton of Charles Sturt University has warned that Australia has become a target for Chinese attempts to stifle criticism.

Remember the ape

It is time for a clarion call for greater caution. While led by China, the BRI will also involve large financial commitments from more than 60 nations that are parties to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, including Australia and many other Western nations.



We all have a giant stake in the Belt and Road Initiative. It will bring sizeable economic gains for some, but in nearly 40 years of working internationally, I have never seen a program that raises more red flags.

27,27,FL-2018-000051-CHN,A Son's Journey Back to Beichuan - Sixth Tone,https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1002228/a-sons-journey-back-to-beichuan,"This article is part of a series about the Wenchuan earthquake, which left more than 80,000 people dead or missing in May 2008.



When photographer Yang Weihua rushed to the site of the Wenchuan earthquake in southwestern China on the night of the disaster, he found utter devastation. As rescue workers looked for survivors in the mountainous epicenter in Sichuan province, Yang recorded what he saw and helped out where he could.

In Beichuan, one of the hardest-hit counties, Yang alerted rescue workers to a young boy trapped under a collapsed building. After soldiers pulled him out and began carrying him away on a stretcher, the boy made a military salute. Yang’s photo of that moment, “Saluting Child,” landed on the front pages of newspapers across the country.

The fame that followed always sat uneasily with Yang, as if he were profiting off others’ pain. He decided to continue documenting the county as it rebuilt — a means of healing himself, too, a colleague later said. The deadly earthquake not only rewrote the fates of many families; it also scarred those who saw the destruction up close. Medical research shows that many witnesses suffered from varying degrees of post-traumatic stress disorder.

When others suffered, I was rewarded. - Yang Weihua, photojournalist who covered the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake

Yang died of liver cancer in early 2015, cutting short his project to document Beichuan’s rebirth. With the earthquake’s 10th anniversary approaching, his son, Yang Bo, realized how little he understood his father and the emotional toll his work had taken on him. Earlier this year, Yang Bo, now 28, traveled to Beichuan — a journey that taught him as much about his father’s interviewees as it did about the man himself.

This is Yang Bo’s story, as told to Sixth Tone and edited for brevity and clarity.

People have always told me that my father, Yang Weihua, was passionate and responsible. To be honest, I always felt he was distant, a familiar stranger. When I was a child, my parents divorced. Perhaps because he found a new partner afterward, we cautiously avoided talking about our emotions. Even when he was on his deathbed, we never had deep conversations.

My father was a photojournalist at Mianyang Evening News, a local newspaper in Sichuan. The pictures he took of the 2008 earthquake, most notably “Saluting Child,” and the sense of guilt they brought on drove him back to Beichuan again and again to record the county’s resurrection and the rebirth of the people’s spirits. All the while, he could not help but go beyond his photojournalist duties and devote himself to helping his subjects.

When media contacted me to ask about the pictures my father took over the years in Beichuan and his feelings about the place, I couldn’t really answer them. I had no idea how he had felt, and I was ashamed. If being forgotten is the ultimate death, had my father ever been truly alive in my heart?

That was the first time I sat down and carefully sorted through the photos he had left behind. The devastation of the day the earthquake struck terrified me when I looked through the pictures one by one. I knew that some of the survivors he photographed trapped beneath the rubble would die moments later; that, along with emergency workers, my father helped rescue one person but couldn’t save the next, whose breath was slowly fading.

A long time after the earthquake, my father told me that he would often hear people calling for help from beneath the ground. I don’t know if he ever spoke to a psychologist, but my father’s colleague said his frequent trips back to Beichuan to take photos and help people was his own healing process. After the earthquake, my father simplified his life to the extreme. Whenever he had nothing to do, he’d go to Beichuan. It often felt like atonement. “When others suffered, I was rewarded,” he once said.

In February, I went back to Beichuan. I wanted to know how the earthquake had affected my father, and what the disaster meant to him. And my father would certainly have wanted to know how his interviewees were doing or hear the latest news about the Tangjiashan barrier lake, a body of water formed as a result of the earthquake that has threatened to flood the area ever since.

Before Chinese New Year, I went to visit Lang Zheng, the boy from “Saluting Child.” As soon as I entered their family home, Zheng embraced me warmly. I was surprised. We had met before, but even though he had been close to my father, he was always shy with me.

My father didn’t just take Zheng’s famous photo — he was the one who found Zheng amid the ruins, where he had been buried for around 12 hours. “I really love that little boy. That he lived was no easy feat,” my father told the press. After the earthquake, he rarely missed an opportunity to document each stage of Zheng’s life.

Zheng started middle school this year. At 1.7 meters, he is tall for his age. His father often takes him to play basketball, and they love to talk about the NBA over dinner. When Zheng’s father, a policeman, said he had to work on Chinese New Year’s Eve, Zheng was disappointed. “Why are you so unlucky! So many people, but they picked you!” he complained. “Hey, that’s lucky,” his father said. “Out of so many people, they picked me.”

Seeing their intimate interactions, I was a little envious. My father and I had never had such a normal, natural conversation. Zheng said that he missed my father very much, and that he would sometimes take a detour while riding his bicycle just to go past the place where my father was staying.

“My only wish now is to raise Lang Zheng well,” the boy’s father said, “so he’ll grow up to be a good person and won’t let down your father’s spirit in heaven.”

There were many couples who, in middle age, lost their only children in the earthquake. Because it was very hard for them to conceive another child naturally, the government made assisted reproductive technology available to them for free.

One such couple were Wang Shuyun and Liu Hongying, who were both over 40 years old when they lost their 19-year-old son in the earthquake. Moreover, Wang had undergone a vasectomy. But with the help of in vitro fertilization, Liu gave birth to a girl, Wang Furong, the first test-tube baby to be born after the earthquake.

Now 8 years old, Furong is a lively second-grader who is doted on by her parents. My father remained close to the family for years before he died, helping them find a school and a house, and often sending them gifts, including money.

Heavy flooding hits the old town of Beichuan Qiang Autonomous County, Sichuan province, July 9, 2013. By Yang Weihua

When I was in college, I would join my father on his trips to Beichuan during summer and winter vacations. In July 2013, torrential rains triggered severe flooding in the area. The old town, a collection of ruins that have been preserved as a reminder of the tragedy, was almost entirely submerged. Wearing full-body waterproof suits, we ventured into the flooded earthquake site. With our feet sinking into the mud and the water reaching our necks, every step was a struggle. A moment of carelessness would have been enough for the floodwater to submerge us. I remember wondering whether my father was scared, too.

Since the earthquake, water has continuously threatened the area. A month after the quake, my father stayed near the Tangjiashan barrier lake, which had formed after the earthquake triggered landslides that blocked off a river. At night, my father couldn’t see anything; he could only hear soldiers reporting the water level, which was ever on the rise. There was a plan to shrink the lake by blowing part of the barrier away with explosives, but the risks were enormous. If too many of the rocks suddenly gave way, a flash flood would follow. My father said he was prepared for the worst.

Today, a single container is all that’s left of the Barrier Lake Emergency Command Center. Square-shaped red signs spell out a slogan referencing a since-discarded plan to turn the area into a tourist attraction: “Miles of Flowers Look Upon the Houses, People Visit the Barrier Lake From Miles Away.” On the narrow road to Tangjiashan, past steep cliffs, workers are still busy clearing stones that block the way.

Just recently, part of the dam collapsed. The rushing water destroyed a bridge that connected to a rebuilt village. I took the only road to the village, which had been repaired only two months prior. In my father’s photos, the barrier lake takes many forms. When the water level was high, there was the risk of the dam bursting. After the water level dropped, the ghostly remains of flooded villages emerged from the deep.

The rebuilt Beichuan is a thriving, modern county, but the Tangjiashan barrier lake is a constant reminder that, when faced with the forces of nature, human life is fragile.

During my return to Beichuan, one thing kept popping into my head. On one of our summer trips to Beichuan, my father and I chanced upon an apple tree. Hanging from high branches, apples glittered in the sunlight. I was hungry but couldn’t reach the fruit. My father told me to stand on his shoulders, and I managed to pick two apples. I handed him one, asking if he wanted to eat it. He shook his head.

I couldn’t find the apple tree again, but I did feel my father by my side once more.

Activists staged a protest outside the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta on May 8, coinciding with a state visit by Premier Li Keqiang, to condemn Beijing’s involvement in the project.

In a letter submitted by the demonstrators to the embassy, they demanded China withdraw its support for the project due to the massive environmental threats posed by the endeavor.

JAKARTA — Activists in Indonesia have called on the Chinese government to withdraw funding for a hydroelectric dam that threatens to fragment the only known habitat of the most endangered great ape on Earth.

Representatives of the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi) staged a demonstration on May 8 outside the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta in protest at Beijing’s planned funding for the $1.6 billion project, which is part of China’s Belt and Road initiative.

The protesters argued that the North Sumatra Hydro Energy project threatened the Batang Toru forest in North Sumatra province, home to the Tapanuli orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis), a species described just last year but already perilously close to extinction with a population of fewer than 800 individuals. Over the course of three generations, the ape has lost 83 percent of its population as its habitat in the Batang Toru ecosystem has been fragmented.

The protest coincided with a state visit to Indonesia by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, where he was welcomed by President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo to discuss a slew of bilateral partnerships that have flourished since China introduced its Belt and Road initiative in 2013.

Dana Prima Tarigan, the executive director of Walhi’s North Sumatra chapter, told reporters that the protest was meant to “convey our aspiration to save the Batang Toru forest in North Sumatra province, where China is funding the development of a hydroelectric dam.”

The protesters also sought to submit an open letter to the embassy in which they asked embassy officials to facilitate talks with Chinese investors and funders of the project in order to make them aware of the environmental and social risks posed by the project.

“We believe that every foreign investment in our country, whether from China or elsewhere, shouldn’t contribute to the erosion of people’s livelihoods and more importantly to the extinction of a critically endangered species,” the letter read.

The protesters, however, failed to meet with embassy staff and were removed from the premises by security officers because they did not have a permit to stage a protest.

Habitat fragmentation

The planned hydropower plant was announced in 2012 and will be the largest on Sumatra once completed by 2022 as planned. The Indonesian government considers it a priority project under the Jokowi administration’s wider infrastructure-building push.

The project will occupy 6.45 square kilometers (2.5 square miles) of land along the Batang Toru River in South Tapanuli district. It will involve the construction of a powerhouse, a substation, headrace and tailrace tunnels, a reservoir, spillway and related infrastructure, the installation of turbines, generators and transformers, and the laying of transmission lines.

Major lenders have stayed away from the project, likely because of the potential environmental damage, with the World Bank backing off from funding the project.

But this hasn’t slowed down Chinese developers. The state-owned Bank of China has pledged financing for the dam, while state-owned Chinese utility Sinohydro has signed on to handle the construction.

The project would dramatically change 96 square kilometers (37 square miles), or about 8 percent, of the Tapanuli orangutans’ range in the next four years, according to a new study published in the journal Current Biology. Long before the dam goes into operation, its construction would impact the orangutans’ habitat by carving through the forest to open up access roads and pathways for power lines. Such openings increase the odds that farmers will clear more land for agriculture or hunters will enter the area.

“More than 50 hectares [124 acres] of forest have been cleared [for the project] and each month, the forest clearing intensifies,” Walhi’s Dana said.

While an 8 percent reduction in habitat might not seem significant, the ape’s remaining habitat is already compacted into a tiny area less than a tenth the size of Sydney, Australia.

“If it proceeds, the dam will flood crucial parts of the ape’s habitat, while chopping up its remaining habitat with new roads and power lines,” Jatna Supriatna, an author of the new study and researcher at the University of Indonesia, said in a statement.

The project also threatens to displace indigenous communities, who refuse to sell their lands at the prices the developers have offered. Last year, a protest by locals from three villages against the development of the dam turned violent.

Activists are also alarmed over the project’s environmental impact assessment, known as the Amdal, which contains disturbing details on how the dam would wreak havoc on locals’ farms, according to Dana.

“The dam will siphon river water for 18 hours, so around 1,200 hectares [2,965 acres] of farms on the riverbank will be dried for 18 hours,” he said. “And then during the next six hours, the sluice will be opened, flooding the farms.”

Dana said this would threaten 100,000 people whose livelihoods are dependent on the farms and other resources provided by the Batang Toru ecosystem.

There are also key omissions in the environmental impact assessment document, including the fact that the project site sits on top of a tectonic fissure.

“The document doesn’t mention anything about risk of earthquakes, while under the project lies the Toru [fault],” Dana said. “Meanwhile, the project includes the digging of a tunnel, which will increase the risk of an earthquake. But this risk wasn’t studied. And other risks on the loss of livelihoods weren’t studied either.”

Operations from a nearby gold mine, operated by PT Agincourt Resources, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-listed miner G-Resources Group Ltd., could exacerbate the environmental damage from the dam, Dana said. He noted that the Amdal document contained an agreement for PT Agincourt Resources to dump its waste through the dam. In 2012, the company temporarily stopped the operation of its Martabe gold mine following an ongoing dispute with local residents over the firm’s waste management.

“Once the sluice gate is opened, the waste from PT Agincourt will be dumped,” Dana said. “We can see how dangerous it is for the river ecosystem and people living on the riverbank.”

Lawsuit threat

Dana said Walhi might file a lawsuit against the dam developer if the project went through, on the basis of irregularities in the Amdal document.

“We’ll go to the state administrative court to stop the permit if the financiers don’t cancel the project,” he said. “As I said before, the Amdal document doesn’t contain any assessment on the risk of earthquakes and the impact on people living on the riverbank.”

While the central government has not made a decision on the future of the project, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry has acknowledged the issues and vowed an assessment of the potential impact from the power plant project on the orangutan habitat.

“It’s better for all parties to sit together to share information comprehensively,” Wiratno, the ministry’s director general for ecosystem and natural resource conservation, told reporters on Tuesday. “I’m ready to facilitate the meeting [between all stakeholders].”

Previously, he said he’d see the impact of the project first before deciding on whether to allow it to proceed.

LI HAIJUN considers himself lucky. His home was destroyed by a huge earthquake that hit the south-western province of Sichuan on May 12th 2008. But like most of his neighbours in the mountain village of Wolong, 16km (10 miles) from the epicentre, he was busy tending his crops. He and his family all survived and spent nearly a year living in a tent. The government paid much of the cost of building a new house close by. The 25,000 yuan ($3,925) he had to contribute was no small sum, but Mr Li, who is 46, says he has no complaints. The disaster is still a bitter memory, but life is back to normal.

The earthquake, centred on Wenchuan county, killed about 70,000 people and left some 18,000 missing—the deadliest in the post-Mao era. It was not only a human tragedy, it was also a severe political test for the ruling Communist Party. In the age of the internet, the government’s response could be monitored nationwide in real time. Contrast that with the secrecy the Maoist system was able to impose on the Tangshan earthquake of 1976, in which around a quarter of a million people died. Its epicentre was a mere 150km from Tiananmen Square, yet it was years before the government even acknowledged the death toll. The Wenchuan earthquake occurred in a very different China—one with a large new middle class that was anxious to help. For a party unused to co-operation with civil society, this posed a challenge.

Netizens quickly became aware that many of those killed were children, who were crushed in their schools. Parents and activists staged protests to vent their fury at officials for having allowed the construction of such “bean curd” buildings. The government responded by intimidating or detaining participants. (Radio Free Asia, a government-funded service in America, reported this month that campaigners in the town of Mianzhu had been put under surveillance or placed under house arrest in the lead-up to the tenth anniversary.)

But the government was more welcoming to those who merely tried to assist in the relief efforts. On their own initiative, NGOs and around 3m private citizens headed to Sichuan, where they distributed water, blankets and other supplies. It was, says Zhang Xuemei of the Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences, “an important turning-point” for civil society in China.

The government is less keen to hail it as such. It prefers to crow about the heroic response of the army and above all of the Communist Party. Officials can indeed claim considerable credit for getting the area back on its feet. Today in the city of Dujiangyan, on a site where hundreds of children died when their school, Xinjian Elementary, collapsed, there is a roast-duck restaurant and a panda-themed pedestrian shopping area. The rest of the block consists of elegant new buildings in grey brick adorned with decorative wood carvings.

In Yingxiu, another badly stricken but now rebuilt town near the epicentre, officials have turned another school into a memorial (pictured). One week before the tenth anniversary, soldiers were streaming up to lay flowers and bow in respect. It is no surprise that officials have chosen to highlight the story of this school, and to pave over the one in Dujiangyan. At the Yingxiu school, the death toll was far lower: 43 students and eight teachers killed.

But Ms Zhang, the social scientist, says the earthquake did result in a change of attitude by the government towards civilian involvement in disaster relief. “This event provided a model for how social forces could be put to use to respond to a big crisis,” she says. At the time, officials had no guidelines for working with civil society. The flood of volunteers caused congestion and compounded difficulties with feeding and sheltering everyone. But NGOs and the government soon established trust—a spirit often lacking in the party’s dealings with organisations that it does not control. When another big quake struck Sichuan in 2013, she says, the government was more prepared. “They said, ‘OK, we can put out the money and you can do the work.’”

The new model involves leaving the heavy work of rebuilding cities and roads to the government but creating space for civil society in areas such as the counselling of bereaved families. After the more recent earthquake, NGOs helped to resolve conflicts that erupted during the relocation of survivors of destroyed villages. In the past few days, a local group in Dujiangyan has been raising funds for quake victims with permanent disabilities. Ms Zhang says NGOs have been particularly helpful in the rebuilding of shattered societies.

In 2009, on the first anniversary of the Wenchuan earthquake, the government published a white paper promising to give “full scope” to participation by grassroots organisations and volunteers in such work. Its response to the earthquake in 2013 showed that it was not merely paying lip-service to the idea. A new Charity Law, which came into force in 2016, aims to make it easier for some domestic NGOs to register and raise funds. But in recent years Xi Jinping, China’s president, has been lashing out at those parts of civil society—independent lawyers, for example—that try to help the likes of the aggrieved parents in Sichuan. China’s government has shown it has the capacity to rebuild disaster zones quickly. But it remains suspicious of the motives of some of those whose help it badly needs.","Thu, 10 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20180512_CNP001_0.jpg,"['officials', 'turning', 'huge', 'zhang', 'sichuan', 'civil', 'social', 'ago', 'wenchuan', 'ngos', 'earthquake', 'school', 'point', 'china', 'society']",

ADDIS ABABA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- For Tedela Chala, a supermarket worker in Addis Ababa, going to work is no longer the nightmare it used to be in the past, when traffic jams were an integral part of the chaotic city.

""(Now) it takes only 10 minutes to reach my workplace,"" the 37-year-old said, describing his fast, cheap and reliable commute on the light railway, the first in sub-Saharan Africa.

Today, the four million residents of the capital rely on the Addis Ababa Light Rail, the 475-million-U.S.-dollar project built with Chinese technology and currently operated by Chinese experts. The Export-Import Bank of China provided 85 percent of the funding.

The light rail and another Chinese-built transport project, the Ethiopia-Djibouti Standard Gauge Rail, are flagship infrastructure projects representing the socioeconomic importance of Chinese engagements in one of Africa's fastest-growing economies.

The two railways also showcase the transformation of Ethiopia's infrastructure, eventually providing convenient transportation all the way to its neighboring Djibouti.

Chala says the light rail has brought convenience to his work and life. ""I am lucky to have this modern transportation today,"" he said. ""I am very proud and lucky.""

The 34.25-km light railway, with 39 stations across the city, was built by China Railway Engineering Corporation, which currently operates it together with the Shenzhen Metro Group, another Chinese company.

Beginning operation two years ago, the light rail currently serves an average 101,000 passengers daily, with the number sometimes leaping to 185,000.

The Ethiopia-Djibouti Standard Gauge Rail is providing both passenger and freight transportation between Ethiopia and Red Sea nation Djibouti.

WINGS FOR LANDLOCKED ETHIOPIA

Ethiopia, a landlocked country, heavily relies on the seaports of Djibouti with 95 percent of its import and export commodities presently transported via the Port of Djibouti.

Abebe Tola, a carpet trader in Addis Ababa, regularly purchases blankets in Dire Dawa, a city about 510 km from the capital where quality blankets are available at affordable prices.

Transportation difficulties are now a thing of the past, Tola said, referring to the Ethiopia-Djibouti railway starting commercial freight and passenger services in January this year. The service is also substantially cheaper.

Since the railway became operational, Tola brings dozens of blankets back to Addis Ababa by train. It costs him only 616 ETB (22.4 dollars) for a two-way ride, whereas a flight could have set him back by minimum 130 dollars.

The 752-km transnational railway, East Africa's first electrified railway, is also expected to ease congestion at the long-serving Port of Djibouti as well as expand Ethiopia's exports and international trading.

According to Hu Shaode, deputy chief financial officer of Djibouti Port Co., the congestion at the port is easing as containers can be transported to Ethiopia via the railway in less than 10 hours.

Jointly constructed and operated by two Chinese companies -- the state-owned China Railway Group Ltd. and China Civil Engineering Construction Corp. -- the railway has transported some 30,000 passengers and more than 11,000 containers of various types in its four months of operations.

As Ethiopia ambitiously strives to become the hub of Africa's light manufacturing industries with a lower-middle income status by 2025, the government is also building an economic belt along the railway. The industrial parks built in the belt will be an economic game changer for Ethiopia, turning the railway into a development corridor.","Tue, 08 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",,"['feature', 'addis', 'goals', 'rail', 'light', 'railway', 'chinese', 'development', 'ethiopia', 'chinesebuilt', '2025', 'port', 'china', 'transported', 'railways', 'track', 'ababa', 'xinhua', 'meet']",

It used to be that college graduates applied for jobs at banks or state-owned enterprises, the proverbial “iron rice bowl” that their parents sought for them after the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. But many of those jobs were unsatisfying: In a 2012 Gallup survey, 94 percent of Chinese respondents said they were unengaged with their jobs. Now, with public and private funding flowing into Chinese start-ups, entrepreneurship has become an appealing alternative for a generation disillusioned with the conveyor-belt career paths of their forebears.

There are plenty of homegrown success stories to inspire them. Where Chinese youth once worshipped at the altar of Steve Jobs, now they look to emulate Jack Ma, Robin Li, and Lei Jun, the founders of e-commerce firm Alibaba, the search engine Baidu, and the phone manufacturer Xiaomi. Alibaba’s IPO in the United States in 2014 was the biggest in history, raising $25 billion, and Xiaomi just filed its own IPO in Hong Kong, which is expected to raise $10 billion.

The tech revolution in China is ubiquitous in urban life. I use the messaging app WeChat for work calls and vacation bookings. I pay for a cup of coffee or a ride in a car with a scanned QR code on my phone. I go to work at a rented desk in an “experimental life space” called 5Lmeet, built in an old soy-sauce factory, which offers pop-up cuisine, a cashless, staffless convenience store, and an office space, the entrance gate to which uses face-recognition software to let me in. Every time I come out of a subway stop in Beijing, I have to fight through a mass of the cheap, rentable bicycles that have transformed transportation in the city. Dai Wei, the CEO of the leading bike-rental firm, Ofo—reportedly valued at $2 billion—is 27 years old.

In years past, Chinese companies have faced accusations that, rather than coming up with new inventions, they’re simply copycatting U.S.-made technologies for Chinese consumers—a trope that has made it onto the current season of Silicon Valley. As the progenitor of the so-called “four great inventions” (the compass, gunpowder, papermaking, and printing), China has now claimed “four great new inventions”—shared bikes, e-commerce, mobile payment, and high-speed rail. The simplest of fact-checks reveals that none of those originated in China, though they were certainly popularized here.

But China has begun fostering a more creative entrepreneurial culture. In 2015, Premier Li Keqiang unveiled a plan, known as “Made in China 2025,” to update the country’s economy by investing in advanced industries, through subsidies, low-interest loans and other aid for Chinese companies. Within the next decade, China wants to be the world leader in robotics, artificial intelligence, and clean-energy cars, among other fields. President Xi Jinping’s consolidation of power—most recently with the abolishing of presidential term limits—means that policy can reshape economy through a level of top-down control that democracies cannot emulate.","Mon, 14 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Kpkqb3Ew5tPgAsUWfzStQLEJN3g=/0x436:3000x1998/960x500/media/img/mt/2018/05/GettyImages_516335602/original.jpg,"['chinese', 'xiaomi', 'li', 'tech', 'chinas', 'revolution', 'jobs', 'work', 'space', 'silicon', 'threatens', 'life', 'phone', 'china', 'valley']",

NEW ORLEANS – A series of summertime storms once again brought the city of New Orleans to its knees as flooded streets brought the evening commute to a screeching halt.

Up to four and a half inches of rain fell over parts of the city in as little as an hour and a half, clogging catch basins and causing flooding in areas that were also hard hit last August.

Mayor Latoya Cantrell lifted the parking restrictions on the neutral grounds across the city and encouraged citizens to get their cars to higher ground.

Some residents though didn’t get the warning in time. In the 3600 block of Dumaine Street, even higher profile vehicles like SUVs succumbed to the floodwaters as they quickly rose.

Meanwhile on Canal Street in front of University Medical Center, several vehicles parked earlier in the day saw floodwaters rise above the floorboards, leaving soggy owners with a mess to deal with once the waters recede.

The rains slacked off by the evening hours and are expected to finally end overnight. As drier air moves in on Saturday, it will allow homeowners and vehicle owners an opportunity to start the cleanup process.","Fri, 18 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://wgno.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/stranded-motorist.jpg?w=1280,"['restrictions', 'flood', 'neutral', 'higher', 'street', 'owners', 'city', 'vehicles', 'torrential', 'rains', 'latoya', 'orleans', 'flooding']",

Ten years after the devastating 7.9 magnitude Sichuan earthquake which killed almost 90,000 people in western China, Li remembers how it only took a few seconds for her life to be changed forever.

""I didn't know what was going on because I had never experienced this before. My ex-husband suddenly dragged my hands and we began to run, and the next minute I was buried,"" she told CNN.

Her home was in Dujiangyan, one of the cities closest to the epicenter of the quake, which was so strong it thrust the ground up by almost 30 feet (nine meters) in some places and caused tremors 925 miles (1,500 kilometers) away in the Chinese capital Beijing.

After being trapped in the rubble for more than 10 hours, Li lost both her legs.

The years since haven't been kind to her. Now walking with prosthetic limbs, Li said her husband left her due to her disability and she thought about ending her life.

But she said the work of Chinese volunteers and her family had helped her. Now she works as a singer for tourists, assisted by a pension from the Chinese government. ""It's my life-altering point,"" she said.

Like Li, Chinese media coverage of the anniversary has focused on the positive -- articles commending the rebuilding or discussing how the disaster helped spark a flood of volunteerism. And Wenchuan County, the area hardest hit by the quake, has named the anniversary date as ""Thanksgiving Day,"" according to state news agency Xinhua.

But critics say the coverage masks the deep scars the earthquake left on the region and its people. Photos from the site of the earthquake show not all the damage has been repaired 10 years later.

The day the earth shook

The earthquake struck in a mountainous, relatively isolated region in western Sichuan, with many of the worst affected areas hours drive from the capital Chengdu.

While Li was in her home when the tremors began, many of the areas's youngest residents were still in afternoon classes at schools.

The student death toll stunned the country. Among those killed or missing were at least 5,000 students, according to the Chinese government, many of them crushed when their school buildings collapsed on them.

According to UNICEF, about 12,000 schools across Sichuan were damaged by the earthquake, or one in seven.

It came at a significant moment for China, just weeks before the Beijing Olympics which were intended to showcase the country's grand stepping out on the world stage.

At the time, the Chinese government's management of the disaster itself was considered a success. ""It was a sort of moment when civil society groups and emergency aid groups sort of worked harmoniously together,"" Kerry Brown, director of the Lau China Institute at King's College London, told CNN.

The usually restrictive government even allowed in foreign aid workers to assist with the cleanup, a move Brown said may have had something to do with the upcoming Olympics. ""If they hadn't addressed this it would have been a terrible advertisement for what was about to happen,"" he said.

Crackdown

But as questions were raised around the quality of construction at the Sichuan schools and the accuracy of the student death toll, the Chinese government cracked down harshly, provoking outrage.

Many of the student deaths were blamed on the poor construction of buildings, thrown together at low cost in the heat of China's economic boom in the 2000s.

Activists who worked to help earthquake victims were jailed and complaints about the quality of building materials were silenced. No court cases were allowed to be brought.

At a press conference in March 2009, then-Vice Governor of Sichuan Wei Hong said in answer to questions about building quality that government investigations had found ""the magnitude and intensity of the earthquake was the most important cause to structural damage.""

Wei added the government understood the angry reaction of parents who had lost children in the earthquake.

An examination by UNICEF in the months after the earthquake of all the school buildings in Sichuan found that thousands would have to be rebuilt or retrofitted.

""(It) was symptomatic of an era when everyone was going going crazy for growth. Buildings were going up left, right and center, it was a pretty free for all environment,"" Brown said.

A report by Amnesty International in 2009 said parents of students who had died in the earthquake were detained when they tried to get answers about their children's deaths.

When Chinese artist and dissident Ai Weiwei attempted to draw attention to the students' deaths through art installations, including one of thousands of children's backpacks. In 2009, he claims he was beaten up by police offers while preparing to testify in the trial of an earthquake activist.

'You can never forget'

Ten years later, Brown said the Chinese government appears to have learned some lessons from the Sichuan earthquake.

Building regulations were tightened and revised in the wake of the earthquake, to alleviate concerns over poor construction standards.

When he took power in 2012, President Xi Jinping vowed to crack down on corruption, which had been blamed for poor building standards and low quality public facilities.

According to Brown, while there was no doubt unsafe buildings were still being constructed in China, regulations were now being enforced more strictly.

""I think the government was aware this was a potentially dangerous moment,"" he said. ""I think they did think this is the kind of thing that could have become very, very unmanageable and I think since then they haven't been so complacent.""

On China's heavily censored and policed internet it is difficult to tell exactly how much public anger or gratitude surrounds the government's handling of the Sichuan earthquake.

But for Li Yingxia the earthquake and its consequences are still very real for her. She just finished her last surgery on her legs and still has three steel pins in her face.

""The earthquake is something you can never forget,"" she said. ""I grew a lot from it. I'm content that I'm alive.""

Looking back at that period, Li says just one question remains: ""Although I can understand why my husband left me because of my disability, I can never understand why he didn't visit me when I was in hospital.""","Fri, 11 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180511182755-01-sichuan-earthquake-anniversary-super-tease.jpg,"['chinese', 'li', 'quake', 'deadly', 'sichuan', 'left', 'felt', 'decade', 'quality', 'going', 'heartache', 'earthquake', 'brown', 'think', 'buildings']",

Even so, the figures Starbucks shared with investors were jaw-drop worthy. No. 1: The fact Starbucks plans to open a China restaurant ever 15 hours for the next five years.

“No Western company or brand is better positioned to evolve with the rapidly expanding Chinese middle class—and we continue to mindfully evolve a coffee culture in China where the reward will be healthy, long-term, profitable growth for decades to come,” Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said in a statement.

5 Ways Starbucks is Innovating the Customer Experience.

Starbucks aims to engage the 'occasional customer.'

This amounts to roughly 600 Starbucks per year in China—a growth path that will bring the brand to roughly 100 new cities across Mainland China by the end of 2022. Naturally, such expansion is going to balloon revenue. Starbucks said it expects to more than triple revenue and more than double operating income in China over the next five years. In addition, Starbucks is launching Starbucks chilled cups in June as part of its goal to expand ready-to-drink premium points of distribution to 125,000 in 400 cities.

If Starbucks makes good on these initiatives, the chain will essentially double its store count in China to 6,000 restaurants across 230 cities by the end of 2022 (relative to full-year 2018 levels). Currently Starbucks operates about 3,300 units in 141 cities in China and employs 45,000 people.

“The power of our brand in China, the strength and momentum in our business, and the world-class Chinese leadership team give me great confidence in our ability to capture the enormous growth opportunities ahead in this dynamic market,” Johnson said.

In the second quarter, same-store sales in China increased 4 percent, year-over-year. Net revenues for the China/Asia Pacific segment hiked 54 percent over Q2 2017 to $1,186.4 million, primarily driven by incremental revenues from the impact of Starbucks’ ownership change in East China, incremental revenues from 759 net new store openings over the past 12 months, and favorable foreign currency translation.

Digital will play a leading role moving forward. Starbucks said the number of active past 90-day loyalty members has nearly tripled over the past four years to nearly 7 million in China, and 90 percent of members are actively engaged via Starbucks’ app. In terms of digital payment, China reports more than 60-percent digital tender mix, and 80 percent cashless transactions.

The “Say it with Starbucks” social gifting feature pioneered in China on WeChat less than 18 months ago. Starbucks announced that it’s expanding the platform to Alibaba. Starbucks also first tested augmented reality at the Shanghai Rostery. It tested this technology in core stores February during Chinese New Year.

Starbucks is being deliberate in its growth, despite how rapid and extensive it appears. The chain created what it called “a brand roadmap” to deepen coffee knowledge in the region and curate a “Starbucks Discovery Journey” that shows respect for local heritage specific to China. Locally curated core-store experiences are the key, Starbucks said.

In 2014, the brand built its first Starbucks Reserve Bar to provide immersive experiences beyond just the standard cup. Starbucks plans to have 200 of these by the end of 2018.

“Starbucks is committed to playing the long game in China and is proud to be an integral part of the local community for nearly 20 years. Our company has a strong, healthy, responsible business with purpose-driven values that celebrates our incredible 47 years of coffee expertise in sourcing, roasting, blending and handcrafting some of the world’s finest coffees,” said Belinda Wong, Starbucks China chief executive officer, in a statement. “The strong trusted relationships between our partners and customers give me great confidence in our ability to deliver our long-term growth while continuing to make investments in China, for China.”

A Starbucks Reserve Roastery opened in Shangai about six months ago. Next month, it’s debuting a multi-unit flagship—the Beijing Fun flagship store. Aside from the Roasteries, it will be the largest store globally, and will be located inside the high-traffic Beijing Fun shopping area. Again, the unit will focus on immersive experiences typically showcased at Roasteries through three craft bar experiences: Starbucks Reserve coffees, Teavana Teas, and mixology.

Returning to Starbucks’ plans to expand its ready-to-drink business in China, the chain said it would leverage the recently announced global coffee alliance with Nestlé to provide even more at-home options to the Chinese consumer. The alliance is expected to grow Starbucks CPG presence from 28 to nearly 190 countries worldwide. It will also bring Starbucks Coffee to both the Nespresso and Nescafé Dolce Gusto machine platforms around the world.

Starbucks added that it is committed to using its scale and success to give back to communities as the company continues to grow in China. Undertaking a series of commitments, The Starbucks Foundation and Starbucks China are contributing meaningful and enduring social impact through poverty alleviation by creating opportunities for groups facing barriers, strengthening partner-driven and locally relevant community engagement, and improving the lives of Yunnan coffee farmers and their families through a $20 million five-year commitment.

“As a purpose-driven company, we have a strong responsibility to the future of China—this vision fuels our passion each day and drives us to exceed the expectations of our partners and customers,” Wong added. “These initiatives reaffirm the strategic role of the China market and highlight Starbucks ongoing aspiration to elevate our partners, customers and communities to create an environment where everyone can thrive.”","Thu, 17 May 2018 16:28:16 GMT",https://www.qsrmagazine.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/story/starbucks-china-goals-store-every-15-hours-4-years.jpg?itok=-1N0FHye,"['chinese', 'coffee', 'store', 'nearly', 'hours', 'experiences', 'brand', 'company', 'goals', 'growth', '15', 'starbucks', 'china']", 
40,40,FL-2018-000051-CHN,Why housing values in New York’s flood zones have stayed down after Hurricane Sandy - PBS NewsHour,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/making-sense/why-housing-values-in-new-yorks-flood-zones-have-stayed-down-after-hurricane-sandy,"Editor’s note: Francesc Ortega and Suleyman Taspinar are economics professors at Queens College, City University of New York. This analysis is being published here in collaboration with EconoFact, a nonpartisan economic publication.

THE ISSUE

The chance of large-scale coastal flooding episodes is increasing. In the last few decades, sea levels have been rising steadily at about 3 centimeters per decade and many estimates expect that this rate will accelerate going forward. At the same time, the population living in coastal counties in the United States grew by 40 percent between 1970 and 2010 and is projected to continue rising. Are people considering the increased risk of flooding associated with sea level rise in their housing decisions? Looking at what happened to property values in New York City after Hurricane Sandy gives us a first look at how those on the front lines may be responding.

THE FACTS:

Past research has found the response of homebuyers towards flooding risks and the threat of other climate-related hazards to be short-lived. While a region’s exposure to hurricanes or flooding does not vary greatly from one year to the next, many studies have found that homebuyers tend to take these risks much more into account immediately following hurricanes and other catastrophic events. However, these effects tend to be short-lived — very often vanishing completely within five years (see here and here). Flood insurance take-up rates, for instance, have tended to spike the year after a flooding event and then gradually decline to the levels that prevailed before the flood. This response happened not only in the flooded zones but – to a lesser extent — also in non-flooded areas in the same television media markets according to one study. While the risk of flooding remains objectively the same, people may be more aware of it following a flood and then tend to forget about it with the passage of time. It is also possible that, as time goes by, new people who have had less direct exposure to the risk move into the area. These facts suggest a gap between objective probabilities of flood risk and households’ perceptions of this risk. In addition to the psychological biases mentioned, coordination problems, misguided policies, and the expectation of financial assistance by the government in case of disaster might contribute to a mismatch between home prices and damage risk.

Hurricane Sandy was a climatic event of unprecedented proportions that impacted the Greater New York region. The storm hit New York on October 29, 2012. At the time, Sandy was the largest Atlantic hurricane on record and the second costliest in U.S. history (behind Hurricane Katrina), with damages amounting to over $19 billion. Hurricane Sandy flooded 17 percent of New York City (or nearly 90,000 buildings).

At the time, Sandy was the largest Atlantic hurricane on record and the second costliest in U.S. history. Did Hurricane Sandy change New Yorkers’ perception of flooding risks? In our research, we analyzed the effects of Hurricane Sandy on housing prices in New York City. We assembled a large parcel-level dataset containing all sales during the period 2003-2017 along with FEMA data on which building structures were damaged by hurricane Sandy, and to what degree. Our data shows that, prior to Sandy, housing values were essentially the same for properties located on the flood zone and properties elsewhere in the city, once neighborhood and property characteristics are accounted for. In contrast, we find robust evidence of a negative impact of Sandy on the price trajectories of houses in New York’s flood zone starting in the quarter immediately after hurricane Sandy (see map and chart). We estimate a persistent price discount of about 8 percent that, 5 years after the hurricane, shows no signs of vanishing.

Within the flood-zone, the price trend for properties differed depending on whether they were damaged during the storm. Properties damaged by Sandy experienced a large immediate drop in price (of more than 15 percent), followed by a partial recovery that probably reflects their gradual restoration as owners invested in their repair (see here). In contrast, properties within the flood-zone that were not damaged by Sandy saw a gradual decline in their value. By 2017, the price discount on these flood-zone properties appears to converge to the same discount as properties that had suffered damage during the storm.

Other emerging research is finding signs that home buyers in some coastal markets are beginning to take into account increasing flood risks. Our findings for New York are in line with the findings of a recent study using national data, which estimates a 7 percent price discount for properties exposed to rising sea levels and argues that the effect is driven by sophisticated buyers and communities concerned about climate change. Similarly, a new study of Miami-Dade County, Florida, finds that prices for properties that are closer to sea level — and hence more subject to flooding risks — are appreciating more slowly than properties at higher elevations (see here).

WHAT THIS MEANS

A timely revision of beliefs about the risks entailed by climate change is important to remain optimistic about the adoption of policies and innovations to help coastal cities adjust. Our findings suggest that, in some cases, catastrophic events — and the economic disruption they bring forth — may be needed to create awareness regarding the changing risks associated with climate change. Five years after Hurricane Sandy, housing prices in New York City’s flood zone have seen an 8 percent reduction when compared to similar properties with lower flooding risks. Unlike findings from other floods, where prices drop sharply following the event but only for a short period of time, the price decline in the flooding-zone following Sandy shows no sign of fading for now.","Fri, 11 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2018/05/RTX3IILX-1024x683.jpg,"['flood', 'values', 'housing', 'hurricane', 'sandy', 'price', 'risks', 'stayed', 'properties', 'prices', 'zones', 'risk', 'yorks', 'york', 'flooding']", 
41,41,FL-2018-000051-CHN,China chaos lifts U.S. fiber giants – for now - Resource Recycling,https://resource-recycling.com/recycling/2018/05/08/china-chaos-lifts-u-s-fiber-giants-for-now/,"China’s import shifts have meant plummeting OCC prices, a fact that’s been a boon to the bottom line of U.S. mill owners. But paper executives aren’t expecting the scenario to necessarily become the new norm.

Resource Recycling analyzed recent quarterly earnings calls from six of the largest publicly traded recovered fiber consumers in North America: Cascades, Graphic Packaging, International Paper, Packaging Corporation of America, Sonoco and WestRock.

These companies consume millions of tons of recovered fiber annually. Old corrugated containers (OCC), which they use in large volumes to produce new containerboard, account for much of the mill operators’ recycled-material purchasing. But they also consume other grades in smaller amounts.

As Chinese import changes have unfolded over the last nine months, OCC prices have fallen considerably. And according to executives on the earnings calls, domestic mill operators have enjoyed the fallout, with some seeing millions of dollars worth of feedstock savings during the first quarter of 2018 alone.

The National Sword initiative from China has also left huge tonnages of mixed paper looking for a home. While U.S. mills currently take in relatively small tonnages of this mixed material, at least one company has started making significant investments to start handling more.

At the same time, leaders say they likely have a limited window of opportunity to take advantage of significantly boosted recovered fiber supply. That’s because demand for fiber packaging globally seems destined to continue to grow, so the economic balance will likely be restored sooner rather than later.

It’s important to note that the paper executives made their comments before China’s May 3 announcement that it was implementing a month-long shutdown of China Certification and Inspection Group’s North American arm, a move that is expected to freeze U.S. scrap shipments to China over the coming weeks.

OCC prices generate savings, surplus fills mills

The profit benefits being seen by fiber companies amid low OCC pricing were most clearly articulated by Graphic Packaging, which produced nearly 1.1 million tons of containerboard at five domestic mills in 2017.

In the first quarter of 2018, Graphic saw its recycled fiber costs drop $3 million, Stephen Scherger, senior vice president and chief financial officer, said during an April 24 call.

Graphic manufactures containerboard entirely from recovered fiber. It buys about 1 million tons of secondary fiber per year, half of which is OCC and double-lined kraft paper. Executives noted that if OCC was to stay at its current price of $75 per ton for the entire year, the company’s total 2018 OCC expenditure would come in a whopping $20 million below initial projections.

Meanwhile, a leader at packaging producer Cascades, which consumes more than 2.4 million tons of a variety of recovered fiber grades annually at its North American mills, said the price situation for recycled feedstock could even get better.

“OCC has been in abundant supply in North America, even during February, when generation is typically at its slowest,” said Luc Langevin, president and chief operating officer, in the company’s March 1 earnings call. “Near term, OCC pricing could potentially continue to decline. This is certainly good news for Cascades as a whole.”

Barry Saunders, senior vice president and chief financial officer for Sonoco, said his company is anticipating OCC prices falling another $10 in May.

But while China’s National Sword policy has given domestic OCC buyers plenty to smile about, executives noted the profitability equation is nuanced.

For example, Cascades and some other players in the sector also operate materials recovery facilities. And the lowered OCC pricing is hurting revenue of the recycling side.

“Inventories are very good at our mills, but it will make it harder for the recovery sub-segment to replicate last year’s outstanding Q1 performance,” Cascade’s Langevin said.

And for some end users, other market factors countered the low feedstock prices. For instance, WestRock, Graphic Packaging and International Paper all said increased costs from the tight freight market nearly offset the savings they have enjoyed from lower OCC costs.

Absorbing mixed paper

As China’s import policies continue to affect global flows of recycled fiber more significantly, a major question mark is whether mills in the North America will be able to take in loads of mixed paper. This material has of late been reported to have virtually no value for MRF operators because China made up such a significant portion of global demand, and the country has shut off that flow entirely.

In the plastics recycling sector, there have been recent reports of domestic reclaimers adjusting to take in material that was previously destined to China as well as news of processors from China angling to open operations in North America.

Could a similar phenomenon unfold in mixed paper? Fiber executives said it would be an uphill climb.

Mark Kowlzan, CEO of Packaging Corporation of America (PCA), pointed out that fiber feedstock is just one component of the cost for a facility, and that labor, energy and transportation also have to be factored in when considering conversions or new investments.

“You have a significant number of costs that have to go into the analysis to tell somebody whether they can make a project make sense financially,” Kowlzan said. “And so, you have to believe that with the lack of conversions so far that have truly taken place that the math just doesn’t work in many cases.”

Nonetheless, Sonoco says it is set to spend millions of dollars to absorb some of the flood of material no longer headed for China.

“We’re making investments in our mill system so that we can take advantage of more loose paper,” Sonoco CEO Robert Tiede said in an April 19 call. He noted Sonoco “made a strategic decision to invest $60 million to $70 million into our mill system.”

The company has invested in “best-in-class machines,” he said. Work on those improvements is already in progress, he said, but it is part of a wider three-year process for the company to improve its mills throughout North America.

The company anticipates the improvements will generate $25 million in net earnings over the next three years.

‘We’re going to see [China] come back’

Company leaders avoided making too many cut-and-dry predictions on material pricing, pointing to China as a wild card that could change things at any time.

“You have a market which has that significant a player impacting prices; it’s just hard to see where prices are going to go,” said WestRock CEO Steve Voorhees on an April 27 earnings call. “So we’re going to stay flexible and be able to adapt where the market goes.”

But many of the fiber executives did say they expect the current supply and demand phenomenon to be relatively short lived.

Tiede of Sonoco hypothesized that recovered fiber shipments would eventually rise back up as the Asian giant’s manufacturing sector demands additional feedstock to meet increasing capacity.

“As I think about China in totality, I think about the thirst of those new machines that are going in and the magnitude of input that has to go in there,” Tiede said. “I’ve got to believe that over a period of time, we’re going to see them come back into the marketplace.”

Glenn Landau, senior vice president and chief financial officer of International Paper (IP), predicted on IP’s April 23 earnings call that there will be “strong demand for recovered fiber” in the future. That prediction, he noted, assumes that global growth continues, because corrugated box packaging will play a large role in facilitating that commerce growth.

The American Forest & Paper Association told Resource Recycling that its 2017 projection for U.S. containerboard capacity was 38.4 million short tons, slightly up from the actual 2016 capacity of 38.2 million tons.

Landau said the sector’s growth will place pressure on OCC over time. Ultimately, that would logically lead to a more valuable commodity, IP Chairman and CEO Mark Sutton noted.

“If you believe in global growth of fiber based packaging, then you understand that OCC is going to become more and more valuable,” Sutton said.

Thomas Hassfurther, PCA’s executive vice president of corrugated products, said that Chinese manufacturers are going to have to continue obtaining fiber to run their paper mills, “one way or another.” China has a few options to do so, he said. The country can relax import regulations to allow more OCC in, or mills can pay more to suppliers to facilitate capital improvements for recycling facilities, allowing them to produce higher quality product.

Alternatively, Chinese mills can buy more linerboard, which is used in containerboard manufacturing. Producers can buy finished linerboard instead of consuming OCC to create it themselves, but doing so adds considerable expense. Hassfurther said this is definitely happening, as linerboard imports are up substantially.

China is also working to bolster its own domestic collection system, but Hassfurther pointed out OCC collected inside China is selling for about four times the price of U.S.-imported material.

Whichever route proves most popular, Hassfurther said he sees the current market as temporary.

“I think it’s bound to go back up, but impossible for me to predict,” he said. “I just think that it will find its level and it will level out at a certain point that makes sense for all the parties that are involved.”

Sonoco’s Tiede said his company expects OCC prices and exports to China will be down “lower for longer” compared with previous market disruptions. But he also noted that the last time he made a forecast on OCC prices, it was proven wrong the next day.

42,42,FL-2018-000051-CHN,"Panel: China's Eurasian Influence Plans Raising Concerns in India, US - USNI News - USNI News",https://news.usni.org/2018/05/06/panel-chinas-eurasian-influence-plans-raising-concerns-india-u-s,"Beijing’s leaders are determined to pry away Greece, Hungary, Poland and other nations from reliance on the European Union to make China the dominant Eurasian economic and security power, two Indian security experts said Wednesday.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leaders in Beijing have a long-term view of dominating large swaths of land and water economically, militarily and culturally, Samir Saran, president of the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi, said at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C.

“They are salami-slicing Europe” by extending the Chinese One Belt One Road initiative to the West.

Saran compared it to the Chinese successful initiatives to spread its reach in Asia, starting with India’s neighbors like Pakistan and smaller Himalayan nations Bhutan and Nepal by building port facilities, airports and offering credit. Across Africa Beijing is financing and constructing roads and dams in a host of nations and opened its first overseas military base in Djibouti. China has also made several investments in telecommunications and energy in Turkey, a NATO member and a nation bridging Europe and Asia.

However, the Chinese “have taken some blows” and seen an ebb and flow of their influence-peddling through the One Belt One Road drive, but what they see as the fixed goal is a single market of $40 trillion. To get there they ignore regional differences between South Asia, South East Asia and Europe, Saran said.

Sunjoy Joshi, director of Observer, termed this goal of controlling such a grand market as “the great prize of the 21st century.”

“No one can ignore each other,” he added in recognizing that China not only is a rising power but a great power. Joshi was referring to the United States, India, China, the European Union and Japan, particularly in the resetting of relationships with Beijing’s larger global role as a fact and the unexpected twists of events.

As one example of how international relations quickly shifted with a twist of events, he said, “see what happened in North Korea; [it was] completely unexpected,” the possibility of a summit meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un on the denuclearization of the peninsula rather than a shooting war.

An example of a shift based on changed facts is “China is a country definitely focused westward” in pursuing its larger interests by “pushing for the soul of Europe.”

Joshi added often India, the United States and its allies and partners in South Asia and Southeast Asia think in terms of regional silos, not how issues from security to trade to infrastructure in one area affect another. China sees these two areas “as one geopolitical region” and even expands that vision eastward and westward, northward and southward.

The question is, “How can you [as a nation including economic powers such as the United States, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and the European Union — all liberal democracies] benefit from China’s rise?” This means, China’s concept of a rules-based order is different from theirs, Joshi said. He and the other panelists suggested these countries create their own infrastructure and development bank as China has done and Russia has done for its immediate neighbors.

For India, one step in seeing China under Xi realistically to has been to realize the “limits to partnership” and “limits to enmity” with Beijing. He called the recently concluded informal summit between Xi and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi an attempt to “lower the temperature” between the two nations. India and China have been engaged for decades in border disputes that even now have escalated into exchanges of gunfire.

“The health of the U.S.-India relationship is very solid,” and that was important to both nations and other democracies in this era of an expansionist China, Jeff Smith, a research fellow at Heritage, said.

On the security front in the last four or five years, he noted the approval to sell armed unmanned aerial vehicles to New Delhi to better defend its border, expanded dialogue over maritime issues in the eastern Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific and the stationing for the first time of a liaison office in Central Command headquarters to coordinate activities from one geographical command to another and provide an Indian perspective as examples of this.

He was also optimistic that the on-again, off-again logistics agreement between India and the United States would finally be signed, opening the way for further security pacts to deepen the relationship.

At the same time, the Trump administration has cut military aid to Pakistan significantly in response to its inability to control cross-border Taliban and Haqqani Network attacks in Afghanistan and is again exploring other logistical routes to support forces in the region. It’s a move that India views favorably.

Smith praised the Malabar Exercises, now an Indian, American and Japanese naval exercise. This year, it scheduled to be conducted near Guam and will involve surface ships, including aircraft carriers, submarines and land-based aircraft. He suggested the three nations should “consider inviting our cousins in Australia to participate.”

“Our shared challenges are not going away,” he said.","Sun, 06 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.usni.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Prime_Minister_of_India_Narendra_Modi_and_President_of_China_Xi_Jinping_before_the_beginning_of_the_2017_BRICS_Leaders_meeting.jpg,"['plans', 'panel', 'security', 'states', 'union', 'china', 'chinas', 'influence', 'asia', 'indian', 'nations', 'united', 'eurasian', 'india', 'xi', 'raising', 'concerns']",

In the year 2000, just 10.5 million Chinese travelled overseas. That was less than 1.5 per cent of all international travellers for that year. In 2017 Chinese tourists made 145 million cross-border trips according to the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute.

Today, more than one in every 10 international travellers comes carrying a Chinese passport, and they have deep pockets. Chinese tourists spent $US261 billion in 2016 according to the institute, more than twice as much as US travellers, second on the big-spender ladder.

See Also China travel guide

Impressive as those numbers are, these numbers are just the tip of the Chinese iceberg. Less than 10 per cent of the Chinese population of 1.4 billion owns a passport, and the number of Chinese citizens who travel overseas continues to grow at a faster rate than the total number of global travellers.

The China Outbound Tourism Research Institute predicts that overseas trips by Chinese citizens will increase to more than 400 million by 2030. That would require Chinese outbound tourism to grow by 8 per cent each year which is ahead of trend, but a figure close to 300 million is highly likely.

A significant number of the cross-border trips made by Chinese travellers were to ""Greater China"" – Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan. While those destinations alone have accounted for more than half of all Chinese overseas tourism in recent years, the percentage has been dropping since 2015 as Chinese travellers spread their wings to more distant, more exotic and unfamiliar destinations.

And even when you subtract the number of Chinese who visited Greater China destinations, the number of Chinese who travelled into the wider world is still greater than the number of US citizens who travelled beyond their own borders, second on the ""most travellers"" ladder.

After Hong Kong and Macau, the most popular destination for Chinese travellers in 2017 was Thailand, with almost 10 million visits. This was despite the Thai Government crackdown in late 2016 targeting ""zero-dollar"" package tours, under which tourists pay for food and accommodation upfront, with much of the payments for travel bookings siphoned off through foreign-national intermediaries. Japan was the next most popular destination for Chinese travellers in 2017, followed by Vietnam and South Korea.

Although it sits well down the league tables – Germany records more Chinese visitors – Australia is benefiting massively from Chinese tourists, with 1.39 million arrivals in the year ended February 28, 2018, a 13 per cent jump from the previous year. That was the first year when China overtook New Zealand as our number one source of international visitors.

In 2017, Chinese visitors also replaced Australians as the number one source of visitors to Indonesia, with Bali by far the main beneficiary of the influx.

Chinese tourists are contributing to the tsunami of world tourism that is overwhelming some European cities such as Barcelona and Venice, however their travel patterns differ in some significant areas from those of Australians, Europeans and North Americans.

Many travel overseas in the major Chinese holiday periods of early May and October and around the lunar new year, months when Europeans and North Americans are more likely to stay home. They often travel to places that others are unlikely to visit, such as the city of Trier in Germany's Moselle region, birthplace of Karl Marx. They also tend to travel quickly. Even in culturally rich destinations such as London, Rome and Paris, two-night stays are not uncommon.

According to the United Nations World Tourism Organisation, Chinese tourists account for more than a fifth of the money spent by international travellers. Every Chinese visitor spends about twice as much per day as the average non-Chinese tourist, which is part of the reason that every national tourism office is doubling down on its efforts to attract them.

However regrettable some of the aspects of mass tourism might be, there are plenty of reasons to welcome the phenomenon, even apart from the flood of dollars and employment opportunities it creates.

Chinese tourism is helping drive the spread of China-based airlines. Australia is currently serviced by seven China-based airlines, and that level of competition is keeping the price of international flights at an all-time low in real terms, as well as offering easier access to new cities within China and Asia.

A bigger tourism industry is good for innovation. It encourages tourism operators to diversify. As the number of tourists increases so too do the possibilities. Hotels and tour operators are encouraged to think differently and develop niche products that will appeal to specific tastes.

Kenya’s woes have just increased after a dam burst in Nakuru on Wednesday evening.

The area downstream was densely populated and, as homes were swept away, at least 10 people were killed.

Dozens remain unaccounted for, and 500 families have been affected.

Western Kenya has been particularly badly hit by landslides and floods during this season of the “long rains”.

Discussions have been ongoing about the inadequacy of infrastructure and building in vulnerable areas; nevertheless, rains have been heavier than average.

As the sun moves north with the change of season, so the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) follows.

Low-pressure belt

This is the low-pressure belt that encircles the earth near the equator, bringing thunderstorms and moving the wet season north and south of the equator.

It is this movement of the sun that triggers the wet season, but other factors determine how much rain will fall.

In the case of Kenya and its neighbours in East Africa, the temperature of the Indian Ocean is the major factor.

{articleGUID}

Over the past few years, the warmth of the surface layer of this ocean has increased more than that of any other.

This is almost certainly due to climate change and its effect on the flow of the slow-moving ocean currents that transport heat from the tropics to the temperate regions.

Direct measurement of the ocean surfaces is done by thermometer and satellite.

NASA’s most recent evaluation shows that for 1,000km off the coast of Somalia and Kenya, the temperature at the surface of the Indian Ocean is about 1.5C higher than average.

That equates to a larger amount of energy, or warm water, attempting to evaporate into the air above, which in turn makes showers and thunderstorms more vigorous.

More rain will fall out of every storm, and the result will be a wetter-than-average rainy season, for some.

Western Kenya benefited during this season, with the inevitable consequences.

Long Kosal, the Apsara Authority’s spokesman, said that the men were construction workers employed by a Chinese company that was contracted to study the restoration of the site’s waterways, but they did not inform the authorities before they started drilling at the site.

“They are working on waterway restoration from the Mekong River to the Tonle Sap Lake, but they did not contact the Apsara Authority or sent in the request in order to set the location to measure the Tonle Sap Lake. They just came and drilled,” he said.

Jay Inslee proclaimed a state of emergency Saturday for counties in the eastern part of the state that are experiencing severe flooding.

Flooding is affecting Ferry, Okanogan and Pend Oreille counties and could get worse next week.

The proclamation covers these three communities plus 17 other eastern Washington counties facing an increased threat of flooding over the next seven days.

“Flooding caused by recent rains and snowmelt has fouled water and sewage treatment facilities, threatened state highways and local roads, and caused some people to leave their homes,” Inslee said. “Continued higher temperatures are predicted to increase snowmelt and cause additional flooding as rivers and streams continue to rise to record or near-record levels.”

State agencies and local jurisdictions are coordinating resources to address the effects of the flooding, and the governor’s proclamation directs state agencies to implement appropriate response activities.

The State Emergency Operations Center at the Washington Military Department’s Camp Murray was activated Saturday to monitor local efforts and coordinate resources to help officials respond. The proclamation allows the governor to activate resources of the Washington National Guard, if necessary.

The National Weather Service predicts major flooding of the Okanogan River near Tonasket to continue through next week, the Spokesman-Review reported.

The Okanogan River, which runs through Tonasket, reached a level of 19 feet early Friday morning, which is above the 15-foot flood stage.

Okanogan County announced Friday afternoon that it had opened its Emergency Operations Center to coordinate communication about region floods.

The city of Omak has a levee that’s handling water flow but is experiencing backup in storm drains. Some residents and businesses in Omak are dealing with basement flooding, according to an Omak Police Department release. Officials with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Okanogan County Emergency Management are continuing to monitor river levels.

Omak City Administrator Todd McDaniel said the city brought in additional pumps to handle water flow and is on 24/7 watch.

“We believe the levee is going to hold. We are concerned about [water] seepage coming in, but I think we’ll be fine,” he said. “We are hoping we don’t have anyone displaced.”

The Pend Oreille River is forecast to reach a flow of more than 118,000 cubic feet per second by Thursday, which hasn’t occurred since 2011.

The Kettle River reached a crest of 22 feet Friday and is expected to remain above record levels for the next week, the National Weather Service said.

Though the stretch of the Spokane River in Spokane has not yet reached above the flood stage, it was near flood stage Friday. But meteorologists predict it will likely crest there and recede next week.","Sat, 12 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f455217/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1911x1003+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa9%2Fa0%2Ff56a2d14aaee10bb4c5dcf70e5f7%2Fla-1526166093-ka5hds7rpj-snap-image,"['reaches', 'emergency', 'reached', 'washington', 'resources', 'okanogan', 'water', 'eastern', 'state', 'river', 'week', 'levels', 'flooding']",

Passenger Marla DeAnn Haase posted a video on Facebook that shows water rapidly filling an interior hallway. “We are flooding on a cruise, we heard the violins and the silverware all came crashing down,” Haase wrote. “What in the world…say a prayer for is [sic] all.”

She also posted a video that shows crew members attempting to remove some of the water by the bucketload — captioned, simply, “Progress.”

The Carnival Dream vessel left New Orleans last Sunday en route to the Caribbean, ABC reports. The boat’s crew was able to fix the water line issue and return the hallway to good condition, Carnival told ABC in a statement. Passengers affected by the flood will reportedly also get a full refund.

“We appreciate our guests’ understanding and sincerely apologize,” Carnival said in a statement. “We also thank our crew members for their quick action and hard work.”

The cruise line has been plagued by issues lately, including passenger deaths resulting from falls in January 2018 and October 2017. In February, 23 members of the same family were ejected from an Australian cruise after a brawl broke out.

TOKYO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- With the fast development of its neighbors, Japan should face the reality and strive for win-win cooperation with other Asian countries, especially China, a Japanese scientist said.

People-to-people exchanges are the most effective way of promoting such win-win cooperation, and exchanges in the field of science are an important part, Kazuki Okimura, special advisor and former president of Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), told Xinhua in a recent interview.

The scientist, though over 70, is still active at the frontline of promoting sci-tech exchanges between China and Japan.

To enhance youth exchanges between Japan and other Asian countries, Okimura pushed the JST to launch in 2014 the Japan-Asia Youth Exchange Program in Science, known as the SAKURA Exchange Program in Science.

Every year the program invites thousands of students and researchers under 40 from other Asian countries to visit Japan for academic exchanges.

During their one-to-three-week stay, the visitors go to Japanese universities, research institutions and science facilities and have the chance to talk to Nobel laureates.

In the past four years, around 6,500 Chinese participated in the project, accounting for almost one third of all participants.

The program can serve as a bridge between the two countries' students, researchers and universities, and some of the participants may be part of China-Japan science and technology cooperation in future, Okimura said.

Japan was an economic and technology powerhouse for a long time, second only to the United States. But now other countries, including China, are catching up, he said.

Lauding the consistency in China's science and technology policies, he made a comparison: ""While China is making steady progress and spectacular achievements in science and technology, Japan still enjoys certain advantages in some areas.""

Therefore, it would be beneficial for both sides to have their youths, who could be scientists and technicians in the future, to communicate with one another and prepare for future cooperation, he added.

Okimura has been instrumental in the establishment of the China Research and Communication Center and forums between the two countries' universities.

For his long-term contribution to bilateral exchange and cooperation in science and technology, Okimura received the 2015 China International Science and Technological Cooperation Award.","Tue, 08 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",,"['technology', 'japanese', 'okimura', 'science', 'program', 'countries', 'exchanges', 'interview', 'cooperation', 'xinhua', 'scientist', 'foresees', 'japan', 'youth', 'china']",

In Grand Forks, B.C., a community about 520 kilometres east of Vancouver, homes are submerged in brown, murky water. The Regional District of Kootenay Boundary said fire rescue technicians have rescued more than 30 people by boat in the town.

Two days of intense rain caused the flooding in Grand Forks. It’s the worst the region has seen in 70 years, roughly two feet (0.6 metres) higher than ever recorded.

“I thought we were safe here because we’re higher than the river, but it was like a sneak attack,” said Derek Fillion, who was evacuated as the water began to surround his home.

On Saturday, Fillion was able to visit his home for the first time since he was forced to leave. He trudged through knee-high water to rescue a computer he needed.

“You almost can’t recognize the place from when we moved in,” he told CTV Vancouver.

Residents are being reminded to keep all sand bags in place as unseasonably hot temperatures across southern and central B.C. are expected to melt some of the snow pack and bring an second surge of flooding to the area.

The Salvation Army arrived in Grand Forks on Friday in hopes of providing some reprieve. Ginny Kristensen, a major with the organization, said a reception centre has been established to provide a safe place for displaced residents to sleep.

“There is some fear, with the warm weather. They’re not sure what’s going to happen in the next few days. Is there snow pack going to melt? Are the rivers going to rise again?” Kristensen told CTV News Channel on Saturday.

The general feeling among residents, Kristensen said, is “guarded optimism.”

“It ranges from total despair to almost a guilt where their homes have not been hurt,” she said.

Osoyoos prepares for melt

In Osoyoos, B.C., roughly 125 kilometres west of Grand Forks, Mike Campol, the acting mayor for the town, said between 60 and 80 homes have been evacuated due to flooding. Two hotels in the town have also been impacted.

“We’re doing all we can and making the best of it,” Campol told CTV News Channel. “The majority of people are all hands on deck, helping those who need help. This is typical of Osoyoos.”

“Everyone seems to be getting the help they need from those that are able-bodied and who aren’t affected. Whether it be local businesses, residents, local trades. Everybody’s been helping each other out.”

Campol said sandbags are being delivered around the clock and residents have been helping to place them where they’re needed most.

The worst might be yet to come for Osoyoos as temperatures this week are expected to hit 30 C, meaning snow on the nearby mountains should begin to melt.

“We may not see the effects of that melt until the middle of next week,” said Campol. “So potentially we could see levels rise again by the middle of the week.”

Residents are warned to leave flooded areas, avoid fast-moving waters, and not drive through waterlogged areas.

By Xinhua writer Zhang Yongxing

SUVA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to the construction and upgradation by a Chinese company, Fiji's Nabouwalu road, once dusty in the dry season and bogged down in the wet season, has now become a modern and high-quality highway.

""It has cut travel time dramatically from about five hours to around two hours. We are very happy the traffic is now very convenient and local people like me have really benefited from it,"" said Osea Raula, a 39-year-old local resident.

Raula had worked in the Nabouwalu project for two years; now he works in a farm along the Nabouwalu highway. He said he had learnt a lot from his Chinese fellow workers.

The 70 km highway connecting Labasa and Nabouwalu with 14 new bridges, along with another 30 km highway at the Buca Bay, was constructed and upgraded by China Railway First Group (Fiji) Co., Ltd (CRFG), a state-run enterprise of China.

The two projects, located in Vanua Levu, the second largest island in the northern part of the South Pacific island state, were completed respectively as scheduled between 2011 and 2015, with the concessional loans provided by the Chinese government.

The Nabouwalu highway is a major boost to shipping services between the country's two main islands, Raula said, adding that it has brought a lot of business opportunities and helped grow Fiji's economy.

""China is our true and real good friend. I miss my Chinese friends. I want to say Bula (Hello), China and Vinaka Vakalevu (Thank you very much),"" he said emotionally.

According to Wang Gang, deputy manager of the CRFG, the two projects used about 2,000 Fijian workers.

""We are very glad that we can do something to help Fiji promote its highway network in the northern island and make contributions to the local economy,"" Wang said proudly while pointing to the heavy traffic on the Nabouwalu highway.

In the process of the construction and upgrading, the company took into account such factors as geology, environment, humidity, flood and tide. ""We are proud of having finished the projects in time after overcoming a lot of difficulties,"" Wang said.

Umesh Prasad, 49, manager of the Labasa-based Vinod Patel, a retail chain for selling home and building materials, told Xinhua that in Labasa, everyone has been talking about the new road as it definitely has made local people's travel more convenient, rapid and comfortable and has given a big boost to the local business.

""The businesses here in the city have really benefited from this new road as CRFG had helped create more job opportunities for local people,"" he said, adding, ""I also believe that the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative is a good thing for the developing countries like Fiji. It is just like the new road that will provide many business chances for all of us.""

Proposed by China in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, aiming at building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient trade routes of Silk Road.

Luigi Giuliani, a 78-year-old Italian, married a Fijian woman and has operated the La Dolce Vita (The Sweet Life ) Holiday Villas along the Buca Bay highway since 2001.

Giuliani, who said he is from the home country of Marco Polo and has visited China for three times, spoke highly of the CRFG for building the Buca Bay road.

""Just before the opening of this road, the traffic depended on the weather. We just could see three or four vehicles per day, but now we can see three or four vehicles per minute,"" he said, adding that it not only benefits the whole community, but also opens up this part of the island to the extent. ""It is unbelievable, a miracle.""

""Now I have more guests than ever before. They are from different parts of the world. My villas are now full until the end of June, and I believe my guests will keep on coming in the rest of the year. I really want to thank CRFG for building this road, it is a good job,"" he said.

China has become a household name in Fiji. Even for Sepa Noya, a five-year-old boy who walked along the Nabouwalu road with one of his friends, told Xinhua that he knew this road was built by China. ""It is good. Bula, China,"" he said with a smile on his thin and boyish face.

Fijian Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama attended the opening ceremony of the Nabouwalu project, saying that ""our national highways are quickly becoming a source of national pride. A modern road network is being formed before our eyes that will benefit every Fijian.""

The prime minister voiced his support for the Belt and Road Initiative,

Wang Gang said that China's experience is that ""to be rich, one has to build road first."" China and Fiji forged a strategic partnership based on mutual respect and common development in 2014, lifting bilateral relations to a new height.

""I do believe under the guidance of the (Belt and Road) Initiative and with the joint efforts of both sides ... the road to common development will be even wider,"" he said.","Wed, 09 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",,"['feature', 'development', 'road', 'local', 'fiji', 'nabouwalu', 'crfg', 'common', 'helps', 'xinhua', 'belt', 'roads', 'highway', 'island', 'china', 'build']", 
57,57,FL-2018-000051-CHN,"Record floods show world has changed and N.B. must adapt, scientists say - CTV News",https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/record-floods-show-world-has-changed-and-n-b-must-adapt-scientists-say-1.3918235,"New Brunswick's record-breaking floods are a jarring reminder climate change is bringing a watery future that will wash away old patterns of life and force many to higher ground permanently, say environmental scientists and hydrologists.

""The reality is that people expect the world to be the way it was, but it's not,"" said Louise Comeau, a professor at the University of New Brunswick and member of a national panel on climate change adaptation.

When the waters recede, the provincial and federal governments must frankly inform homeowners the future holds more of the same, says hydrologist John Pomeroy, director of the global water futures program at the University of Saskatchewan.

""Sometimes people, when they've been flooded out, it's a good time to offer to buy them out and remove the homes from the dangerous location,"" Pomeroy said in an interview.

New Brunswick is suffering through record flooding, with rising waters forcing the closure of the Trans-Canada Highway between Moncton and Fredericton and many people being forced out of their homes.

""The floods look like they're getting larger,"" said Pomeroy, who is working on a fresh models for mapping future floods, in tandem with a network of university scientists studying the nation's largest rivers.

The hydrologist says the public needs to understand historical levels of water flow are no longer guides to the future.

Sudden temperature flips from frigid April snowstorms to 26 C, as occurred during the spring runoffs in parts of New Brunswick, are a feature of climate change that encourage flooding, he said.

The province's legislative committee on climate change cited computer models predicting that by 2100, New Brunswick's mean annual temperature will increase by as much as 5 C, while more intense rain and snow will increase the amount of moisture hitting the ground.

Those trends aren't the sole causes of river flooding, but higher seasonal temperatures and precipitation increase the risks, says Al Pietroniro, a senior hydrologist with Environment Canada.

""Across the country there's an acceleration of what we call the water cycle, which means because the atmosphere is warming, we're seeing increased precipitation,"" he said in a telephone interview.

Premier Brian Gallant told a briefing last week that it's clear the increasing frequency and severity of severe weather events can be traced to climate change, and the government needs to become more proactive.

""We have to do everything we can to combat climate change. We have to do everything we can to mitigate versus climate change, we have to do everything we can to raise awareness about climate change,"" he said.

""We have to do a better job of mapping where there are flood zones, where there will be the potential for flood zones in the future, where there will be erosion, what can be done to protect our coasts and to protect our communities.""

Comeau, who has authored studies on the impact of climate change in her province, says she suspects that floods once expected every 30 years are now more likely to be ""once every five years or even every two to three years.""

Every region of New Brunswick now has flooding stories to share describing dislocation and disruption, she says. In addition, an ice storm on the Acadian Peninsula in January 2017 caused power, communication and transportation disruptions.

Perth-Andover and the Tobique First Nation have experienced multiple flood events, including the province's most costly event at $25-million in March 2012.

The province provided $8 million to cover the cost of relocation and flood-proofing of low-lying homes, with approximately 80 homes that were damaged, either demolished or relocated, as well as road and downtown changes to infrastructure.

In 2014, in response to recurring flood events, the province released a flood risk strategy, noting that from 2008 to 2014, the province experienced a ""three-fold increase in disaster relief assistance programs triggered by flooding,"" and $100-million in direct costs to the province, estimated to be half of total costs.

Blair Feltmate, the head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, says that ""New Brunswick has an attitude of management by disaster.""

""New Brunswick seems to rush to address risk when it's happening, and then, after the event subsides, the province relaxes and waits for its next disaster.""

Jason Thistlethwaite, an assistant professor at the University of Waterloo's faculty of the environment, said in an interview part of the problem is that municipalities set zoning regulations and collect property tax revenue but it's Ottawa that is paying the lion's share of disaster relief.

""It's good to produce the information (flood plain maps), but ultimately it's hard for a municipality to impose development requirements when their primary source of revenue is property taxes from new development,"" he said.

The province must move more quickly to create a common set of standards on new development for all towns and cities to obey, he said.

The federal government must also refine its approach, he argues, tying disaster relief funding to requirements that homeowners move out of areas doomed to see repeated floods.

The province has entered into agreements with Public Safety Canada to update and modernize existing inland flood maps by 2020 and coastal maps by 2019, said a spokeswoman for the Environment Department.

Officials from the provincial departments of Environment and Justice were otherwise unavailable to comment on the government's implementation of its climate change action plans, which were announced by the Liberals with fanfare on Dec. 7, 2016.

Mike O'Brien, the mayor of Fredericton, says his city has been a leader in adapting infrastructure for climate change, with storm water systems upgraded and some key intersections raised.

New apartment complexes along Queen Street, not far from the high point of the latest floods, were approved several years ago, but the mayor said ""Buildings constructed on the periphery of the flood plain are designed to handle it ... but looking forward and 50 years down the road, what different regulations will have to be considered? We'd love to be part of that discussion.""

Comeau says the provincial government has taken steps, such as improving mapping available to the public, and has been moving towards giving municipalities clearer guidelines on zoning rules in flood plains. Cities are hiring teams to work on flood adaptation, she says.

But she also says people who live near the province's 60,000 lakes and 2,500 lakes and ponds must buy into the science of climate change, and the tough discussion on moving out of flood plains needs to start immediately.

""Often when the infrastructure decisions are being made, the community wants the ice rink fixed rather than the water pipes enlarged,"" she says.

She says she's hopeful the latest disaster may start to shift citizens' attention onto what lies ahead, even as they bail out and cope with the latest round of damage.

""You have to have a conversation about the reality,"" she said.","Mon, 07 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.3918243.1525699495!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,"['flood', 'floods', 'climate', 'scientists', 'nb', 'change', 'province', 'say', 'brunswick', 'water', 'record', 'adapt', 'world', 'changed', 'flooding', 'university', 'increase']",

BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhuanet) -- Chinese cultural and creative products will be promoted at overseas cultural event series, according to a press conference held on Tuesday at the Palace Museum, also known as the Forbidden City.

This year's cultural event series, titled ""China Week: Inherit and Innovate"", are jointly held by 29 Overseas China Cultural Centers, aiming to introduce achievements of Chinese cultural and creative products, further promote Chinese traditional culture and enhance cultural exchanges.

The event series, running from May 10 to June 30, will focus on promoting products related to cultural relics and museums, intangible cultural heritages, animation, digital technology and so on.

China has established 35 China cultural centers worldwide. The number is expected to reach 50 by 2020. The centers have held Chinese culture promotion events annually since 2016.

In almost two decades in Chinese media, he’s moved from working at newspapers in Shanghai to setting up some of the most innovative digital media outlets in China: The Paper — which is overseen by Shanghai United Media Group, a conglomerate owned by the Chinese Communist Party, but has touched on some controversial topics — and its English-language sibling Sixth Tone.

Not content with working only on text-focused ventures, Wei launched Pear Video in 2016. With a cash injection of more than $15 million from China Media Capital and a reported Series A funding round of nearly $100 million, Pear now claims it’s China’s leading short news video platform, generating around 500 million daily views. (The publicly traded unit of People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, was an early investor.) The platform isn’t profitable, but it’s starting to earn revenue through preroll ads and sponsored videos for brands.

Distributed through the platforms of Chinese tech giants Sina, Tencent, and Baidu (the latter two are also investors), Pear’s 1,500 daily videos attract not only young Chinese urbanites, but also some older and more rural residents. The company relies on a country-wide network of 30,000 videographers — none of whom are full-time journalists with Pear — based out of “every province, small city, and in the countryside.”

Below is a conversation with Wei Xing about how he adjusted to the technological revolution in China, how the editorial process at Pear works at such a scale, and how his news ventures try to survive in a tightly state-controlled media industry. The conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.

Paloma Almoguera: What was the trigger that made you want to leave traditional media? When did it happen?

Wei Xing: After 2011, 2012, we felt that the traditional media had declined. The circulation was declining and depended mainly on advertisements. People didn’t like to read newspapers anymore. After 2011, 2012, we felt that the traditional media had declined. The circulation was declining and depended mainly on advertisements. People didn’t like to read newspapers anymore. In 2014, we launched The Paper, a model that worked quite well. It gained a lot of influence at that time, when Xi Jinping was launching his anti-corruption campaign. We gave quite a lot of coverage to corruption cases, like the Ling Jihua one. The foreign media was interested in some of The Paper’s reports. We thought: Why can’t we establish an English media outlet ourselves? That’s how we first had the original thoughts about Sixth Tone. But the English media is very strong, so we were thinking: How can we be different? We decided to focus on the forgotten topics that happen in China. For us, it is easier to travel around China, and we didn’t want to be another China Daily, another NYT. We wanted to report about common people involved in uncommon stories.

Almoguera: Sixth Tone was and still is a pretty successful title inside China among certain circles. What made you leave it to embrace a new experience?

Wei Xing: I think Sixth Tone is very good, but its audience is very narrow. Why? Because for foreigners the first choice is their native country’s media, and the second tier is the international media. I don’t think an ordinary foreigner would choose Sixth Tone as his first or second choice, so the audience is very limited. I wanted to reach a bigger audience, and the Chinese audience is quite big.

I don’t think an ordinary foreigner would choose Sixth Tone as his first or second choice, so the audience is very limited. I wanted to reach a bigger audience, and the Chinese audience is quite big. Another reason is that before. I was always doing text mostly. I had never tried TV or video. I wanted to try something different. And the background was that China’s audience is changing — young people are using their smartphones more and more. So in 2016, I left Sixth Tone and built Pear Video from scratch during six months, with some colleagues from The Paper.

Almoguera: Pear Video doesn’t have full-time journalists. You have defined the model as being based on the “decentralization” of news gathering and an exhaustive fact-checking system. Where do the videos come from?

Wei Xing: We have 500 staff, including tech, marketing, and some administration people. We have built and operate a huge network of videographers; in Chinese we call them paike (拍客). We have around 30,000 in our network — mainly in China, in every province, small city, and in the countryside — and we are still growing that number.

Almoguera: How do you find them, or they find you?

Wei Xing: In every province, we have two people, full-time employees, who act as our local representatives. Their main job is to build and maintain a local videographer network. Every day these videographers pitch videos to their local representatives in the province. They make the first judgement. Out of 200 videos, they may choose 30 of them. The representatives then send these videos to the editing team. In every province, we have two people, full-time employees, who act as our local representatives.

Out of 200 videos, they may choose 30 of them. The representatives then send these videos to the editing team. But we also find videos online. We monitor videos that are uploaded on social media. We have some people who check the content uploaded by citizens, and if we think it is interesting we will contact that person. In China, if you upload a video, according to the regulations, you have to put your ID, so we can trace that person back. But the offline channel is the main source of content. Our videographers are not full-time journalists. Every day, we are recruiting new videographers, but they aren’t just anyone. We don’t think that would be reliable.

Almoguera: How do you make sure the videos that these non-professionals send in are accurate?

Wei Xing: Our local staff does the first step in verifying, because they are based in that province and they know much better than us in Shanghai what’s going on. They will do phone calls, and they have many local contacts to verify the content, so they will do some basic verifying process.

They will do phone calls, and they have many local contacts to verify the content, so they will do some basic verifying process. The second step is taken by our verifying team, which is made up of 20 people, each of whom must verify at least 25 videos a day in order to meet their production schedule. They do cross-checking with social media. They do interviews, call local governments, local witnesses. They monitor Weibo, WeChat. And we also use some AI basic tools to verify the news through an existing database. But not all the videos need the same process. For example, if it’s breaking news, we will of course give it priority and deal with it first.

Almoguera: Have you ever had problems with the government because of a video’s content? In December 2016, Chinese authorities announced regulations concerning the sharing of “unofficial” online videos. We’ve also recently seen a clampdown by the Have you ever had problems with the government because of a video’s content? In December 2016, Chinese authorities announced regulations concerning the sharing of “unofficial” online videos.

Wei Xing: We need to be much more cautious now on the content. We have to abide by the regulations. We need to be much more cautious now on the content. We have to abide by the regulations. Our focus is not much on politics or macroeconomic topics, in the line of Sixth Tone. For two reasons: Most of these topics are not suitable to be covered by short-form news videos, because they are relatively boring. Not so many people want to watch them. And the second reason is that we are focused on the forgotten stories, the people stories, which are almost forgotten by the mainstream media. In many cases, we are quicker than the traditional media. Half an hour after last year’s earthquake, which happened around 9:30 p.m., we had the first video about it, because we had the videographer there. Three or four hours later, we had more than 100 videos about the earthquake. I don’t think traditional media could do it.

Almoguera: What is your target audience? Are short videos meant to be more popular among millennials, who would normally use their smartphones to watch them?

Wei Xing: Of course, the young people, the millennials, are born into the digital era. The video audience is much larger in their age range than in text. Of course, the young people, the millennials, are born into the digital era. The video audience is much larger in their age range than in text. But it’s not only young people who like to watch videos — older people like it too. And not only the people who are living in Shanghai or Beijing, but also people who live in the countryside, because it is difficult for them to read a very long article.

Almoguera: How do you monetize Pear Video? Is it profitable?

Wei Xing: We are still not profitable, because we have only existed for 1.5 years. Our main focus now is to expand our audience, our brand, and our content. It is more difficult to charge the audience for a short video than for longer videos. We are still not profitable, because we have only existed for 1.5 years. Our main focus now is to expand our audience, our brand, and our content. It is more difficult to charge the audience for a short video than for longer videos. Our main revenue comes from advertisements of two kinds. The first one is native ads, solutions for brands. We make the ads for them, and also we distribute the content for them. Another kind is just some very short advertisement previews before the video.

Almoguera: At Pear, you produce news without full-time journalists. What type of message does that send to journalists out there? That new formats don’t need them anymore?

Wei Xing: The product of traditional media is limited. With Pear Video’s network of videographers, we have many more sources, many more news topics. So that’s why we speak of decentralization. We could liberate the journalist’s work — they could focus on other things. The product of traditional media is limited.

We could liberate the journalist’s work — they could focus on other things. But we try to combine both things, like in our fact-checking system. I don’t think technology itself could resolve this; we still need to apply the classic journalism concepts to verify the content.

NAIROBI, Kenya, May 10 – At least 27 people have been killed when Patel Dam burst overnight flooding villages in the Subukia area of Nakuru County.

The toll, the highest in a single flood-related incident now brings to over 160 the number of people who have died countrywide as a result of floods since heavy rains started in March.

The Wednesday night incident occurred at around 9 o’clock in the evening when Patel Dam broke its banks sweeping villages in the Solai area of Subukia.

“We have so far found 27 bodies and the search and rescue operation is still going on,” Gideon Kibunja, CID chief for Rift Valley region told Capital FM from the scene.

Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi flew from Nairobi to lead the operation on Thursday morning and was set to issue a statement over the tragedy at the private dam used for irrigation and fish farming.

Our Correspondent at the scene said she had scene gory images of bodies, including of young children, trapped by debris while others were dug out of mud or retrieved from their damaged houses which were washed away by flood waters.

The Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) reported that thirty-nine people had been rescued in a joint operation with the county government and were admitted to Bahati sub-county and Nakuru County Referral Hospital.

Governor Lee Kinyanjui said Nakuru County was working closely with KRCS as well as the security agencies to coordinate rescue missions.

Among villages affected are those in the farmlands of Nyakinyua, Endao, and Arutani where hundreds of people were displaced.

Also affected were Solai Boys High School and Arutani Girls Secondary School.

Statistics released by the Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho on Wednesday indicated that 222,456 people have so far been displaced as a result of ongoing rains in flood-prone areas.

According to Kibicho, the government had so far distributed food and medicine worth Sh600 million in thirty-two affected counties.

“The government will continue carrying out various mitigation activities across the floods affected parts of the country to; rescue marooned citizens, distribute food, medicine and water, and restore water and sanitation systems to ensure hygienic conditions,” Kibicho said in a statement.

According to KRCS, counties of Turkana, Tana River, Garissa, Isiolo, Taita Taveta, Mandera, Wajir, Marsabit, West Pokot, Samburu and Narok are the most his by the latest spate of floods.

Since March when heavry rains started pouring for instance, at least 8,450 acres of farmland have been submerged in water with an estimated 6,000 livestock killed.

The floods have also destroyed road networks in some parts of the country.

Security services have deployed choppers in areas where roads have been rendered impassible to rescue marooned civilian populations.","Thu, 10 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/files/2018/05/PATEL-DAM-1.jpg,"['flood', 'krcs', 'related', 'operation', 'affected', 'rains', '160', 'raising', 'kibicho', 'nakuru', 'dam', '27', 'deaths', 'water', 'villages', 'floods', 'rescue', 'tragedy', 'die']",

BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China regrets the U.S. decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) signed in 2015, according to Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang Wednesday.

The multilateral deal was struck between Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany and the EU, and was adopted by United Nations Security Council Resolution 2,231. Geng said that all parties should seriously implement it and maintain the integrity and seriousness of the deal.

Geng said implementing the deal was conducive to maintaining the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, promoting peace and stability in the Middle East and demonstrating the significance of solving hot issues through political means.

Geng said that under the current situation, China urged all parties to proceed ""in the long-term and overall situation in a responsible manner, persist in solving and managing differences through political and diplomatic means, and return as soon as possible to the correct track of continuing to implement the comprehensive agreement.""

""China will take an objective, fair and responsible attitude, maintain dialogues and consultations with all parties, and continue to work to maintain and implement the comprehensive agreement,"" he said.

The delays meant families were left without aid for days, he said, as flooding forced thousands from their homes and left others injured or dead.

But Pakistan - one of the world's most vulnerable countries to climate change -- is now trying to boost its ability to respond to disasters, including in the Kashmir region, which is prone to deadly floods, drought, landslides and earthquakes.

Last August, the government set up emergency response centers across the region, in part to speed the flow of information to the National Disaster Management Authority, a federal body that issues early warnings, organizes rescue services, and distributes aid.

There have been no major disasters since the centers were set up, but Hussain is confident they will make a difference.

""We will be able to respond to any disaster in the state more quickly and efficiently,"" the 29-year-old said, sitting in the operations room of the State Disaster Management Authority.

The new emergency response centers have their own wireless radio frequencies to more easily receive direct updates on floods, earthquakes and other disasters, he said.

That will ""improve the capability to handle disasters more efficiently,"" said Abdul Hameed Kiani, deputy commissioner of Jhelum valley district.

More data, more plans

Kashmir - like some other areas of the country - is also working on the ground to cut risks from natural disasters.

Last year, the World Bank lent Pakistan $125 million to restore flood protection infrastructure and strengthen government institutions to manage disasters and climate vulnerability across the country.

In Kashmir, the government has now carried out studies to determine the types of disasters each area faces, so that officials can better prepare, said Atiq-ur-Rehman Abbasi, project director of the Disaster and Climate Resilience Improvement Project in Azad Jammu and Kashmir.

""Now we have exact data about each district, what kind of risk there is and how to cope with it,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

A logistics plan on how to prepare for an emergency and deliver aid during floods, landslides or man-made disasters has been drawn up for every district and state, Abbasi said.

""Making hydro stations secure and stabilizing slopes will benefit tens of thousands of people,"" he added.

The project, for instance, has assessed the vulnerability of people living by a river in Kotli district, where part of a suburb washed away in 2014 river flooding, Abbasi said.

Sajjad Hashmi, a resident there, said river embankments destroyed in the flood have not yet been replaced.

""The river swept away the settlement on both its banks, so a protection embankment could be helpful. But it has not been assessed yet what kind of protection would be suitable,"" said Hashmi, 54.

Raja Mushtaq Khan, a political activist and Kotli resident, said the city has been vulnerable to river flooding for decades, but there had been no concrete protection efforts taken by the government or non-governmental organizations, in part because of a lack of credible data on the threats.

Now, with a study in hand, ""work can be outlined to save thousands of residents,"" said Khan, 59.

Forest protection

Asif Hussain Shah, head of Pakistani Kashmir's planning and development department, said establishing dedicated centers to monitor the impacts of a changing climate and develop ways for the region to adapt is a step in the right direction.

But the real test is whether other departments - such as the forestry department, charged with protecting the region's fast-disappearing trees - will be able to play their part, he said.

Protecting trees both helps limit climate change and can cut the risk of flooding, landslides and other problems as forested land absorbs more water and holds soil in place, he said.

""For now, with the risk (of drought and floods) increasing every day ... we have to equip and prepare ourselves,"" Shah said.

As weather patterns change, monsoon rains are shifting slowly toward the Neelum Valley, a tourist hotspot, Shah said.

That knowledge will now aid preparations to cut risks in the area, he said.

Shafique Abbasi, deputy director of Kashmir's Environmental Protection Agency, said such data is hugely needed in a country that ranks seventh in the list of the 10 most climate change vulnerable countries in the world since 1997, according to the World Climate Risk Index 2018.

BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank Wednesday injected funds into the banking system via open market operations to maintain liquidity.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) conducted 60 billion yuan (9.4 billion U.S. dollars) of seven-day reverse repos and 40 billion yuan of 14-day reverse repos.

The interest rates for the seven-day and 14-day operations were 2.55 percent and 2.70 percent, respectively.

A reverse repo is a process by which the central bank purchases securities from commercial banks through bidding, with an agreement to sell them back in the future.

Offset by 200 billion yuan of maturing reverse repos, the net injection on Wednesday stood at 100 billion yuan.

The PBOC has recently managed market liquidity through targeted moves rather than across-the-board adjustments of interest rates.

The central bank plans to keep monetary policy prudent and neutral, maintain a stable, reasonable level of liquidity, and oversee moderate growth of financial credit and social financing.","Wed, 09 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",,"['yuan', 'reverse', 'injects', 'bank', 'sevenday', 'pboc', 'chinas', 'operations', 'billion', 'repos', 'liquidity', 'xinhua', 'central']",

Shawn McNee posted a YouTube video in which his 75-year-old father, Robert, attempts to enter their family's water-logged cottage on Grand Lake, one of the worst-hit areas during floods that ravaged the province this month.

The video begins with McNee's mother, Darlene, chuckling over the camera at her husband while he fumbles to the door in knee-high rubber boots in the murky, debris-ridden water with pitchfork in hand.

""This may prove interesting, may prove funny, or disastrous,"" Darlene says in the video, giggling.

Determined, and despite his wife's playful banter, the man opens the door, peers inside and tells his wife, who is standing comfortably a few feet away on dry land, that he can't make it past the door, try as he may.

""I told you not to do it,"" Darlene says.

On his way out, he gathers himself on what appears to be a log and a slat of shingles, slipping and sliding until he loses balance and falls belly-first into the murky water -- all while his wife bursts into infectious laughter.

The camera actually misses much of the fall itself -- it swings to the left as Darlene laughs so hard she loses control.

""You don't go swimming in August, why would you want to go in May?"" she eventually tells him.

The scene is reminiscent of family sitcoms in which the quiet, relatable husband risks humiliating himself while the wife watches from the sidelines, making affectionately snarky comments.

The cottage, owned by Darlene and her two siblings, was built by her father in 1961 when Darlene, 72, was a teenager. She said some of her fondest memories were swimming in Grand Lake.

""Back in my day ... everybody was in there swimming, even my father went in -- unlike my husband who doesn't go in,"" Darlene said in a phone interview, breaking into a fit of laughter. ""I don't think he's put his big toe in the water.""

Darlene, who offered to check on the cottage herself, said her husband didn't get hurt when he fell. He even drove home, wrapped in a blanket, sitting on a plastic freezer bag.

""That man went down, he stopped, dropped, rolled before I could get the camera down on him,"" she said.

""I said, 'You're gonna have to take a hot shower you know, get that nasty germs off ya, or you're not crawling in bed with me tonight.""'

The video, posted last Sunday, has over 2,800 views, with one YouTube commenter saying ""Nice to see laughing in such hard times.""

Darlene said she has lost many irreplaceable things because of the flood, including an antique rocking chair that belonged to her grandmother and hand built tables.

""The smell in there -- it's not mould or must -- it's like a dead smell. There's no life. And I just couldn't get it out of my head.""

She said the damage to the cottage is well over $100,000. There is nothing worth salvaging, she said. She said it isn't flood insured, but hopes the government will help cottage owners like herself cover some of the damages.

""This is just stuff,"" she said. ""Too many people are heartbroken, but as long as everyone and their family are still kicking, that's the main thing.""","Sat, 12 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.3926823.1526129878!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,"['posted', 'flood', 'wife', 'husband', 'cottage', 'door', 'father', 'video', 'swimming', 'brunswick', 'finds', 'amid', 'darlene', 'hilarious', 'disaster', 'laughter', 'man']",

TAIYUAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China on Wednesday launched Gaofen-5, a hyperspectral imaging satellite, as part of the country's high-resolution Earth observation project.

The Gaofen-5 satellite was launched off the back of a Long March 4C rocket at 2:28 a.m. Beijing Time from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in northern Shanxi Province. It was the 274th flight mission by a Long March carrier rocket.

The satellite can be used for comprehensive environmental monitoring.

The satellite is developed and produced by China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation and has a designed life of eight years.

According to Tong Xudong, chief designer of the Gaofen series, Gaofen-5 is the first China-developed satellite that can monitor air pollution. It can dynamically reflect the state of air pollution in China through the monitoring of air pollutants, greenhouse gases, and aerosols.

Gaofen-5 is able to obtain spectral information from ultraviolet to long-wave infrared radiation. It is the world's first full-spectrum hyperspectral satellite for comprehensive observation of the atmosphere and land.

Gaofen-5 has the highest spectral resolution among China's remote sensing satellites. It is equipped with six advanced observation payloads, such as shortwave infrared hyperspectral camera and a greenhouse gas detector.

It can investigate material composition through spectral imaging technology.

Wang Qiao, an official from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said the satellite can detect inland water, land surface environment and altered minerals, providing reliable data for China's environmental monitoring, resource exploration, and disaster prevention and mitigation.

It will help reduce China's dependence on foreign hyperspectral satellite data.

Since the Gaofen project began in 2010, China's view of the planet has become clearer.

China will also launch Gaofen-6 this year to form a constellation with other Gaofen satellites in orbit.","Wed, 09 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",,"['hyperspectral', 'spectral', 'china', 'launched', 'chinas', 'environmental', 'long', 'launches', 'launch', 'earth', 'xinhua', 'observation', 'gaofen5', 'satellite', 'monitoring']",

Under China’s new policy, FWD can take up to a 51% stake in the new venture, the remainder of which will be held by two unnamed Chinese partners.

FWD declined to share any further details regarding its partners or the shareholder structure of the joint venture, only saying that it sees “a significant opportunity in China to meet the financial and insurance needs of mainland customers.”

China has embarked on a new policy of opening up its strictly regulated financial industry as protectionism and trade frictions are becoming growing concerns.

Among other recent changes that aim to increase transparency and reduce risk in China’s financial sector are new rules that restrict individual shareholders to no more than 33% ownership in insurance companies, as well as plans to merge the country’s insurance and banking regulators.

SCMP noted that FWD was the fourth large foreign re/insurer to take advantage of China’s relaxed regulations in recent weeks, with Willis, AXA, and Allianz all planning expansions into the market via new or existing companies or through joint ventures.

Though river levels have almost receded to pre-flood levels, unseasonably high temperatures across southern and central British Columbia are expected to melt existing snow packs at higher elevations.

The mass melt is expected to bring a second round of flooding to the town, nearly 520 kilometres east of Vancouver, sometime this week.

In a tweet on Sunday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered those affected by the flooding “any help needed.”

“We’re bracing ourselves that we’re going to be inundated again,” councillor Colleen Ross told CTV News Channel on Sunday. “Plastic and sand bags are the new décor in Grand Forks.”

A “perfect storm” prompted the floods, Ross said, citing record snow pack in the mountains, temperatures as high as 30 C in April and two days of intense rain.

The flood is the worst in Grand Forks since 1948.

The councillor described the city of about 4,000 people as “traumatized.” She said the community will need aid from both the provincial and federal governments for what she said would be a “massive and slow” recovery effort.

The Regional District of Kootenay Boundary has downgraded 74 properties from evacuation orders to evacuation alerts.

However, it said that it would be putting all of its re-entry plans on hold because forecasts and river modelling show that water levels from the second surge could be as high as those from the initial flood.

Evacuation orders remain in place for nearly 1,300 addresses.

The regional district advised residents not to enter evacuation zones, to keep sand bags in place, to avoid fast-moving waters and to be prepared to evacuate from their homes at a moment’s notice.

“Our priority is to get people back into their homes as soon as it’s safe to do so,” Chris Marsh, the emergency operations centre director and program manager for the Regional District of Kootenay Boundary, said in a statement Saturday.

“But we need to respect what weather and river forecasts are telling us — this flood is not over yet.”

The regional district said emergency crews will spend Sunday repairing failed dykes and pumping water from low-lying neighbourhoods. With the assistance of aerial surveys and GIS technology, they also hope to have a more complete picture of damaged areas.

Kate Saylor, a reporter with the Grand Forks Gazzette newspaper, whose building was among many evacuated, told CTV News Channel that volunteer firefighters and search-and-rescue teams are “literally swimming up to homes.”

Firefighters have rescued more than 30 people by boat in Grand Forks.

Even though the area has seen large-scale flooding in the past, “people are really still in a bit of shock,” Saylor said.

NANJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- LG Chem, LG Group's electric battery making subsidiary, and China's Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt have set up a joint venture in Wuxi City in east China's Jiangsu Province.

According to the city government, the two companies on Tuesday signed a contract for the Automotive Battery Anode Material Project, which will be located in Wuxi's national high-tech district.

With a total investment of 1 billion U.S. dollars, construction of the plant will begin in September, and facilities will be put into operation in 2020, producing up to 100,000 tonnes of products per year, with an annual production value of 20 billion yuan (3.14 billion U.S. dollars).

Li Xiaomin, Party chief of Wuxi, said that the city would fully support the construction of the automotive battery project, which is in line with the city's strategy of developing new energy automobile industry.

LG Chem is a major electric car battery supplier for the world.

Houston, TX and the Chinese city of Suzhou signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) committing to trade and biomedical and biotechnology research, according to the Houston Chronicle and other media reports.

As part of the MOU, the China U.S. Biotechnology Innovation Center (CUBIC) by the Chinese nonprofit Jiangsu Industrial Technology Research Institute (JITRI) will open at Houston's Texas Medical Center to help spur investment in both cities. JITRI is one of the top research centers for industrial technology in China with a $300 million research budget and more than 6,000 employees.

Dive Insight:

After the devastation wrought on Houston by Hurricane Harvey last year, the city is looking forward while rebuilding its downtown, strengthening its flood defenses and announcing plans for an innovation district “for startups and imaginative endeavors.” It is significant that JITRI is investing in Houston, considering its status as a major research center in China.

It is also significant that CUBIC will locate at the Texas Medical Center, which last month announced plans to host a medical research campus that also includes the Baylor College of Medicine, Texas A&M University Health Science Center, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. With the Chronicle noting that could open as early as 2022, Houston is primed to become a center for biomedical research.

The partnership comes at a difficult time for U.S.-China relations, with testimony coming earlier this week from business representatives criticizing President Trump’s proposed tariffs as he tries to take a harder line on trade.

Isle of Wight

Several regions internationally that include the low lying Solomon Islands, New Hebrides, Laccadive Islands and even the coastal region of Norfolk, Virginia in the U.S. have reported recent occurrences of rising sea levels and coastal flooding involving seawater. While slow movement of the earth’s tectonic plates could account for the perception of rising sea levels in some regions, the slow melting of ice in the polar regions is another possible cause.

Introduction

The earth’s long-term geological record suggests alternating extended periods of warmer temperatures and colder temperatures. During cold periods such as ice ages, sea levels dropped and exposed land bridges across several shallow channels and straits that may include Bering Strait, Strait of Dover and Strait of Malacca. Ice ages and lower sea levels made possible migration of people and animals between land masses that had previously been separated by seawater. Warmer temperatures reduced the volume of polar ice and caused seawater levels to rise to their current levels, with further slow rise of seawater over the next century.

While rising sea levels would inundate presently inhabitable coastal land, it could prompt governments to seek solutions to preserve valuable coastal developed land. By contrast, some segments of the maritime transportation sector could actually benefit for rising sea levels by offering greater navigation at shallow-draft ports. An increase in port water depths could allow larger ships to call at ports that would previously been off limits to such ships. The arrival of larger ships would translate into lower international shipping rates per unit mass of bulk freight or per unit volume mainly involving container freight.

Dutch Polders

Much of the Netherlands lies below maritime sea level and the construction of sea walls have protected heavily populated regions from flooding by seawater. In the southern U.S., a significant segment of the City of New Orleans lies below sea level and where until Hurricane Katrina, a sea wall has protected some heavily populated areas from flooding by seawater. The sea wall precedents at the Netherlands and at New Orleans could form part of the future business plans of low-lying coastal cities where considerable wealth is invested in tall buildings located near the coast.

The rise of sea levels caused by climatic change is occurring slowly and perhaps sufficiently slowly to encourage numerous city councils and regional governments internationally to consider constructing barriers between the rising sea and heavily populated coastal regions. Given the slow rate by which sea levels are expected to rise, designers of sea walls could develop designs that could progressively be built to greater height in response to the slow rise of the seawater. Less affluent regions and neighborhoods could face the prospect of declining populations as people seek to relocate to higher elevations.

Dredging and Land Reclamation

Some coastal regions could implement a version of the land reclamation initiative that occurred at Cape Town, South Africa, where land was reclaimed from the sea through dredging of Table Bay and depositing the material on the shallow former beach area. Until the 1930s, Cape Town’s old Victoria and Albert docks had served the region from the days of the old wind-driven sailing ships that carried the trade of a bygone era. Cape Town needed a dock capable of berthing longer, wider and deeper draft ships that had been entering service.

The construction project involved dredging, depositing the dredged material on to the beach area and the construction of a sea wall between the sea and land that had been reclaimed from the sea. It is a precedent that could be duplicated elsewhere to raise the height of the coastline relative to sea level. It could also allow for the construction of the equivalent of a coastal seawall that could surround and protect low-lying large inland areas of coastal cities.

Navigation Locks at Straits

During the 1950s era, Canada built a navigation lock across the Strait of Canso as a means to reduce the powerful tidal that had previously flowed through the strait and disrupted ship transportation operations. Courtesy of modern construction techniques, there may be scope to develop sea walls (oceanic dams) and navigation locks across several straits internationally. Possible candidate straits would include Strait of Hormuz, Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, Strait of Gibraltar, Kattegat between Denmark and Sweden, Cabot Strait and Strait of Belle Isle in Eastern Canada plus Queen Charlotte Strait and Strait of Juan da Fuca in Western Canada.

The construction of combination sea walls and navigation locks across several straits will require international cooperation. Locks design will need to include pumping equipment to maintain the elevation of several bodies of water that will include the Baltic Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Persian Gulf and Red Sea. Further research will need to establish as to whether the levels of evaporation from these seas will be sufficient so as to maintain water levels to remain comparable to traditional water levels. Rising sea levels will give rise to large bodies of water at different elevations across the oceanic dams.

Oceanic Pumped Storage

Significant differences in water elevation across a dam structure provides opportunity to install pumping turbines in the dam structure, with the combination of wind turbines, solar PV installations, ocean wave power conversion technology and future radiation-free nuclear fusion power stations being located within close proximity to the oceanic dams. The sheer size of the oceanic dams would allow for power transmission lines to connect to very distant locations including across international borders. For part of the cycle, electric power would push seawater from the low-elevation side to the world’s ocean side.

During periods of high demand for electric power, seawater would flow from the ocean side through turbines to the low elevation side, perhaps a height difference of 50 feet or 15 meters. Each oceanic pumped storage installation may be capable of generating 10,000MW of electric power over four to six hours. The size of the oceanic hydraulic storage reservoirs could provide several months of continuous power generation, allowing for future seasonal energy storage planning. Oceanic dams built across channels and straits could simultaneously protect low lying areas from flooding while making mega-storage of energy possible.

Coastal Land Depressions

As sea levels slowly rise due to changing weather patterns, diverting a small percentage of sea water into land depressions located near the coast could allow affected communities added time to adjust to the rising seas. Land depressions located near an ocean coast include the Salton Sea region in SW U.S., Egypt’s Qattara Depression, Jordan and Israel’s Dead Sea region, a land depression in Eritrea near the Red Sea, a land depression between Tunisia and Algeria as well as the Caspian Sea region. Egypt had proposed to use the Qattara Depression as a means to generate hydroelectric power.

Jordan’s government had proposed to save the Dead Sea by diverting seawater from Gulf of Aqaba and there have been proposals to adapt the Salton Sea for pumped hydraulic energy storage. The precedent of the digging of the Suez Canal can serve as the basis by which to connect channels between the ocean and nearby coastal land depressions. There may also be scope to dredge a channel between the Don River near the Sea of Azov and the Caspian Sea to flow additional water over a period of several years, from the ocean to lower elevation.

Displaced Populations

The transfer of seawater from the ocean to lower elevation would result in displacement of small populations from the regions in and around the Salton Sea, the Algerian/Tunisian land depression. There will be need for international negotiation and compensation to relocate populations from around the Caspian Sea to higher elevation. That compensation could be less than the cost of relocating populations from larger coastal cities located internationally. The transfer of water into the Caspian Sea could provide coastal cities internationally with additional decade of time to adjust to rising sea levels.

The future option of raising water levels in the Caspian Sea would require international negotiation involving agreement among the governments of Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaydzhan and Iran to present a proposal to the international community where coastal cities internationally could be provided with an extended time frame by which to adjust to rising sea levels. Raising the Caspian Sea to international maritime sea levels could allow for ship transportation via navigation canal to and from the Black Sea and also Sea of Azov, in turn providing direct maritime transportation for Azerbaydzhan, Iran, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan to access European ports.

Small Land Depressions

There may be potential to derive possible economic benefit from flooded land depressions. To maintain constant salinity levels, there may be need to install a pipeline on the channel floor between the ocean and the deepest levels of the flooded land depression. Solar driven pumps would push higher salinity seawater back toward the ocean, allowing development of fish farms in the former depressions. Commercial and recreational maritime vessels could sail along canals that connect the ocean to former depressions that could allow for future development of tourist and resort areas.

Allowing salinity levels to rise would result in the capture of solar thermal energy and cause the brine to rise to 70 degrees C to 90 degrees C. At night, there may be potential to generate electric power from the temperature difference between the brine and night time air, or between brine and ocean temperature using ammonia-based Rankin-cycle engines. Large volumes of brine heated seasonally to high temperature could provide seasonal thermal energy storage that could provide winter-time interior heating for buildings along with seasonal power generation.

Conclusions

Future weather conditions could cause melting of ice in the polar regions along with rising levels of seawater. While preventative measures would reduce future volumes of carbon dioxide that enter the atmosphere and that may indirectly cause the melting of Polar Ice, there are other possible methods that could reduce or delay the future rate at which sea levels would rise. Transferring seawater into land depressions could extent the time frame by which populations in coastal cities internationally could plan for rising sea levels. Intergovernmental negotiation and cooperation would become essential to address the problem.

(Xinhua/Fred Mutune)

NAIROBI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenya could be staring at a health crisis as raging floods that have wreaked havoc in many parts of the country threaten to unleash a wave of communicable diseases like cholera, typhoid, malaria and flus.

The Ministry of Health and relief agencies have sounded alarm over possible disease outbreaks in low lying parts of the country and major cities grappling with the extreme weather event.

So far, the Ministry of Health has directed county governments to allocate funds toward mitigating the outbreak of water-borne diseases in the light of flooding occasioned by heavy downpour.

The Kenya Red Cross in its latest briefing revealed that 112 Kenyans had died as a result of floods since mid-March when the long rains began.

Abbas Gullet, the Secretary General at Kenya Red Cross, said at a media briefing on Friday that an estimated 260,000 people displaced by floods were staring at risk of vector borne diseases in the absence of urgent interventions.

""We are monitoring the situation in the camps for people displaced by floods to ward off disease outbreaks. Our volunteers have been providing purification gadgets in flooded regions to keep water-borne diseases at bay,"" said Gullet.

The Kenya Red Cross has already made a 5 million U.S. dollar appeal from local and foreign well-wishers to strengthen provision of emergency assistance to 150,000 flood victims in the western, northeastern and coastal regions.

Gullet said the bulk of the money will be earmarked for supply of food, clean drinking water and medical kit to families marooned by floods in low lying Kenyan plains.

""Our immediate areas of intervention include supply of water treatment chemicals to prevent a cholera outbreak in flooded regions,"" said Gullet, adding that flood victims will also be supplied with mosquito nets to minimize the risk of contracting malaria.

Kenya and its neighbors in the greater eastern African region such as Rwanda and Somalia have been experiencing above normal rainfall accompanied by flash floods.

The three countries have attracted international media spotlight as heavy flooding continue to terminate lives while destroying transport, power and communications infrastructure as well as hospitals and schools.

This phenomenon that is linked to climate change has in particular cast a dark shadow on Kenya's quest to achieve food security after a prolonged drought season.

Nevertheless, both the central government and relief agencies have scaled up emergency interventions in regions affected by flooding to prevent a humanitarian crisis.

Eugene Wamalwa, Cabinet Secretary for Devolution and Planning, has been overseeing efforts to rescue communities marooned by floods and relocate them to safer grounds.

During a recent tour of the epicenter of flooding in the coast region, Wamalwa said the government had set aside adequate funds to cater for food, shelter, clean water and medical services to flood victims.

""The government has mobilized funds, personnel and equipment to ease suffering of people affected by floods. We are aware that many schools and hospitals have been submerged thus denying essential services to flood victims,"" Wamalwa said during a visit to the coast region.

Counties affected by floods have intensified surveillance to prevent an outbreak of vector-borne diseases that could place enormous strain on public healthcare infrastructure.

Local media reports indicate that counties in western Kenya and the coast region have sought additional financial support from the central government and relief agencies to procure essential drugs and promote environmental hygiene in the wake of heavy flooding.

Health officers in the coastal city of Mombasa have been educating communities on necessary measures in order to avoid contracting vector borne diseases like malaria and chikungunya.

The risk of water-borne diseases also looms large in western Kenyan counties thanks to destruction of sanitation facilities by storm waters.","Tue, 08 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",,"['wreak', 'flood', 'floods', 'staring', 'kenya', 'diseases', 'disease', 'wamalwa', 'western', 'water', 'xinhua', 'continue', 'risk', 'havoc', 'waterborne', 'victims', 'outbreak', 'flooding']",

“God cannot be persuaded by rhetorical appeals,” Flood wrote. “He already knows the ‘facts’ of Augustine’s case; and furthermore, He has perfect knowledge of all the possibilities of their presentation.”

Flood may find solace in that perspective as President Trump’s newest lawyer. He joins a White House under siege from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation into Russian political interference, and a legal team buffeted by resignations and a shoot-from-the-id client.

There’s also a potential threat from Congress if Democrats win back the U.S. House in November and regain the power to blanket the Oval Office with subpoenas, or even start impeachment hearings. Activists like billionaire donor Tom Steyer are already pushing to remove Trump from office.

Unlike former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and conservative lawyer Jay Sekulow, who represent Trump personally, Flood will be responsible for shielding the institution of the presidency and the White House from legal problems.

Flood has the resume for it, having worked for two previous presidents. He helped fend off Republicans trying to remove Bill Clinton from office in the late 1990s, and sparred with Democrats probing George W. Bush’s controversial dismissal of U.S. attorneys in 2006.

The high-wire work earned Flood a reputation as level-headed, passionate and scholarly. He also became known for his ardent defense of executive power — an expertise that could prove useful in trying to shield Trump from the Russia investigation.

“He’s the guy that I thought should have been hired for this in the beginning,” said Shannen Coffin, a partner at the Steptoe law firm who worked with Flood in the White House near the end of the Bush administration.

Glen Donath, a partner at Clifford Chance who worked with Flood on Clinton’s legal team during the impeachment process, praised Flood, saying he’s as “experienced as anyone I can imagine in taking on a challenge of this magnitude.”

“There are plenty of mines in this minefield,” Donath said. “But I have no doubt he’s well aware of them going in.”

Indeed, the explosions began only hours after the White House announced Wednesday that Flood would replace Ty Cobb, the second senior lawyer to leave Trump’s side in the last two months.

That night, Giuliani abruptly announced on Fox News that Trump had reimbursed Michael Cohen, his longtime personal lawyer, for $130,000 in hush money paid to the porn star known as Stormy Daniels. Trump confirmed it the next morning in a series of tweets.

The disclosure sent the White House into a scramble, since Trump had flatly denied in April that he knew about the payoff. Critics said the payment could represent a campaign finance violation because it was delivered 11 days before the election to keep Daniels quiet about her alleged tryst with Trump years ago.

Trump confused matters further Friday by telling reporters with a shrug that Giuliani still had to “get his facts straight,” and Giuliani issued another statement trying to walk back some of his comments.

The shifting stories highlight the challenge for Flood as he seeks to counsel a president who famously doesn’t listen to his lawyers or adhere to the truth.

Lanny Davis, who once represented Clinton, said Trump advisors and lawyers privately have expressed concerns about the president’s falsehoods, and have asked, “What do you do if you’re not sure that you’re getting all the facts from your client?”

Flood grew up in the Chicago suburbs as one of 14 children and attended Catholic schools as a boy. After attending the the University of Dallas as an undergraduate, he was awarded a doctorate in philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin. He continued postgraduate studies at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, where he wrote his erudite paper on St. Augustine.

But instead of pursuing a life in academia, he headed to Yale Law School. His work there was stellar enough that after he graduated in 1991, he landed a clerkship with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the conservative stalwart who died two years ago.

Flood was driven more by the law than ideology, however. After working in private practice at the Washington firm Williams & Connolly, he joined Clinton’s legal team during the impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999. Clinton was impeached in the Republican-led House but acquitted in the Democratic-led Senate and served out his term.

Flood brought a scholarly approach that helped shaped Clinton’s legal strategy. Although he wasn’t well known, Flood became “one of the principle architects of President Clinton’s defense,” Donath said.

“Emmet feels that we should respect the results of valid elections and not use the impeachment process as another partisan tool when the opposing party doesn’t get the candidate they want in office,” Donath said. “He believes that in respect to President Clinton, and I suspect he believes that in respect to President Trump.”

It’s a view that likely appeals to Trump, who regularly accuses Democrats of supporting a “witch hunt” on the “hoax” that his advisors conspired with Russians trying to meddle in the campaign.

Flood would be prepared to face off with a hostile Congress if Democrats regain power in November. He joined the White House counsel’s office under Bush after Republicans lost both the House and the Senate in 2006.

“He was at the point of the spear in our relations with Congress,” said Coffin, who worked for Vice President Dick Cheney at the time. Despite the heavy demands, “Emmet had it under control,” Coffin said.

Flood handled the controversy after the White House fired several U.S. attorneys and Democrats accused the Bush administration of forcing out law enforcement officials to push a political agenda.

Flood’s opponents recall him as talented but stubborn, traits made clear in a closed-door questioning of Karl Rove, Bush’s top political advisor, according to a transcript that was released later.

Flood often stepped in to say certain inquiries were out of bounds. At one point he said he’d allow a question only because there was “no sense my wasting any more time than you are wasting.”

Elliot Mincberg, a lawyer who worked for Democrats running the House Judiciary Committee, said Flood stonewalled the panel’s attempts to obtain internal White House documents.

“Most people felt like we would be able to work something out. And we weren’t,” Mincberg said. “He just didn’t yield. Even an inch.”

It’s a very different approach than that of Cobb, who sought to cooperate with the special counsel in the Russia investigation. Trump’s legal team said in January that the administration had provided over 20,000 pages of documents and allowed more than 20 White House officials to be interviewed by Mueller’s team.

It’s still unclear whether Trump will sit down with the special counsel’s office. He appears to be laying the groundwork to reject an interview request — or even to fight a possible grand jury subpoena — although he said again Friday that he would like to testify if he thought he would be “treated fairly.”

“I would love to speak. I would love to go. Nothing I want to do more, because we did nothing wrong,” Trump told reporters outside the White House.

Then he made a promise that might unnerve Flood.

“If I thought it was fair,” Trump said, “I would override my lawyers.”

83,83,FL-2018-000051-CHN,Activists in Indonesia protest China-funded dam in orangutan habitat - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/activists-in-indonesia-protest-china-funded-dam-in-orangutan-habitat/,"Activists in Indonesia have called on the Chinese government to withdraw funding for a hydroelectric dam that threatens to fragment the only known habitat of the most endangered great ape on Earth.

Representatives of the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi) staged a demonstration on May 8 outside the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta in protest at Beijing’s planned funding for the $1.6 billion project, which is part of China’s Belt and Road initiative.

The protesters argued that the North Sumatra Hydro Energy project threatened the Batang Toru forest in North Sumatra province, home to the Tapanuli orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis), a species described just last year but already perilously close to extinction with a population of fewer than 800 individuals. Over the course of three generations, the ape has lost 83 percent of its population as its habitat in the Batang Toru ecosystem has been fragmented.

The protest coincided with a state visit to Indonesia by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, where he was welcomed by President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo to discuss a slew of bilateral partnerships that have flourished since China introduced its Belt and Road initiative in 2013.

“ More than 50 hectares [124 acres] of forest have been cleared [for the project] and each month, the forest clearing intensifies. Dana Prima Tarigan, executive director, North Sumatra chapter, Walhi

Dana Prima Tarigan, the executive director of Walhi’s North Sumatra chapter, told reporters that the protest was meant to “convey our aspiration to save the Batang Toru forest in North Sumatra province, where China is funding the development of a hydroelectric dam.”

The protesters also sought to submit an open letter to the embassy in which they asked embassy officials to facilitate talks with Chinese investors and funders of the project in order to make them aware of the environmental and social risks posed by the project.

“We believe that every foreign investment in our country, whether from China or elsewhere, shouldn’t contribute to the erosion of people’s livelihoods and more importantly to the extinction of a critically endangered species,” the letter read.

The protesters, however, failed to meet with embassy staff and were removed from the premises by security officers because they did not have a permit to stage a protest.

Habitat fragmentation

The planned hydropower plant was announced in 2012 and will be the largest on Sumatra once completed by 2022 as planned. The Indonesian government considers it a priority project under the Jokowi administration’s wider infrastructure-building push.

The project will occupy 6.45 square kilometers (2.5 square miles) of land along the Batang Toru River in South Tapanuli district. It will involve the construction of a powerhouse, a substation, headrace and tailrace tunnels, a reservoir, spillway and related infrastructure, the installation of turbines, generators and transformers, and the laying of transmission lines.

“ If it proceeds, the dam will flood crucial parts of the ape’s habitat, while chopping up its remaining habitat with new roads and power lines. Jatna Supriatna, author, University of Indonesia

Major lenders have stayed away from the project, likely because of the potential environmental damage, with the World Bank backing off from funding the project.

But this hasn’t slowed down Chinese developers. The state-owned Bank of China has pledged financing for the dam, while state-owned Chinese utility Sinohydro has signed on to handle the construction.

The project would dramatically change 96 square kilometers (37 square miles), or about 8 percent, of the Tapanuli orangutans’ range in the next four years, according to a new study published in the journal Current Biology. Long before the dam goes into operation, its construction would impact the orangutans’ habitat by carving through the forest to open up access roads and pathways for power lines. Such openings increase the odds that farmers will clear more land for agriculture or hunters will enter the area.

“More than 50 hectares [124 acres] of forest have been cleared [for the project] and each month, the forest clearing intensifies,” Walhi’s Dana said.

While an 8 percent reduction in habitat might not seem significant, the ape’s remaining habitat is already compacted into a tiny area less than a tenth the size of Sydney, Australia.

“If it proceeds, the dam will flood crucial parts of the ape’s habitat, while chopping up its remaining habitat with new roads and power lines,” Jatna Supriatna, an author of the new study and researcher at the University of Indonesia, said in a statement.

The project also threatens to displace indigenous communities, who refuse to sell their lands at the prices the developers have offered. Last year, a protest by locals from three villages against the development of the dam turned violent.

Activists are also alarmed over the project’s environmental impact assessment, known as the Amdal, which contains disturbing details on how the dam would wreak havoc on locals’ farms, according to Dana.

“The dam will siphon river water for 18 hours, so around 1,200 hectares [2,965 acres] of farms on the riverbank will be dried for 18 hours,” he said. “And then during the next six hours, the sluice will be opened, flooding the farms.”

Dana said this would threaten 100,000 people whose livelihoods are dependent on the farms and other resources provided by the Batang Toru ecosystem.





There are also key omissions in the environmental impact assessment document, including the fact that the project site sits on top of a tectonic fissure.

“The document doesn’t mention anything about risk of earthquakes, while under the project lies the Toru [fault],” Dana said. “Meanwhile, the project includes the digging of a tunnel, which will increase the risk of an earthquake. But this risk wasn’t studied. And other risks on the loss of livelihoods weren’t studied either.”

Operations from a nearby gold mine, operated by PT Agincourt Resources, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-listed miner G-Resources Group Ltd., could exacerbate the environmental damage from the dam, Dana said. He noted that the Amdal document contained an agreement for PT Agincourt Resources to dump its waste through the dam. In 2012, the company temporarily stopped the operation of its Martabe gold mine following an ongoing dispute with local residents over the firm’s waste management.

“Once the sluice gate is opened, the waste from PT Agincourt will be dumped,” Dana said. “We can see how dangerous it is for the river ecosystem and people living on the riverbank.”

Lawsuit threat

Dana said Walhi might file a lawsuit against the dam developer if the project went through, on the basis of irregularities in the Amdal document.

“We’ll go to the state administrative court to stop the permit if the financiers don’t cancel the project,” he said. “As I said before, the Amdal document doesn’t contain any assessment on the risk of earthquakes and the impact on people living on the riverbank.”

While the central government has not made a decision on the future of the project, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry has acknowledged the issues and vowed an assessment of the potential impact from the power plant project on the orangutan habitat.

“It’s better for all parties to sit together to share information comprehensively,” Wiratno, the ministry’s director general for ecosystem and natural resource conservation, told reporters on Tuesday. “I’m ready to facilitate the meeting [between all stakeholders].”

Previously, he said he’d see the impact of the project first before deciding on whether to allow it to proceed.

86,86,FL-2018-000051-CHN,Rebuilt Sichuan town struggling 10 years after earthquake - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Life-Arts/Life/Rebuilt-Sichuan-town-struggling-10-years-after-earthquake,"YINGXIU, China -- Nestled in misty green mountains, the small town of Yingxiu is made up of handsome stone buildings that house numerous restaurants and guesthouses (59 and 67 at the last official count). Chinese national flags flutter from every balcony and signpost in the main street -- spots that in other towns would be reserved for advertising.

But the town is eerily quiet. At first glance, Yingxiu could be taken for a newly constructed resort town, empty as it waits for the start of its first season. In fact, the town in its current form has existed since 2010, following reconstruction after Sichuan Province was hit on May 12, 2008 by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake that left 90,000 people dead, 375,000 injured and 4.8 million displaced.

In Yingxiu, close to the epicenter, 5,462 people died, 80% of the town was destroyed and the main building of the collapsed Xuankou Middle School, listing like a sinking ship, became one of the disaster's most memorable images.

Before the earthquake, Yingxiu's economy depended on agriculture and small industry. Power plants, pharmaceutical factories and other industrial facilities supported local and migrant workers, while the verdant hills above were dotted with villages and farms. As well as hitting industry, the earthquake and its aftershocks and landslides destroyed what little land there was for farming.

After the tremors virtually all the factories closed, prompting some 6,000 migrant workers and their families to move elsewhere. Jobs with companies servicing the factories also became scarce, prompting the departure of at least 1,000 Yingxiu natives to join the ranks of China's 280 million migrant workers.

In the aftermath, the government committed 1 trillion yuan ($157 billion) toward the reconstruction of Sichuan's earthquake-damaged areas, and Yingxiu, as the physical and metaphorical center of the disaster, became the project's focal point. Amid hopes that tourism would be the main engine of economic reconstruction the official aims were ""developing big tourism,"" ""forming large industries,"" and ""establishing large enterprises.""

Yingxiu's new role as a tourist attraction was planned by the Chinese central administration with the ""build it and they will come"" mentality that characterizes most of the country's tourism projects. But little input was sought from residents, and there was little transparency in the process.

The rebuild was designed by the architect behind Wide and Narrow Alley, a historical reconstruction in the provincial capital of Chengdu that has become a noted center of leisure, commerce and tourism. A new highway shortened the travel time between Chengdu and Yingxiu to less than 1.5 hours. In 2013, the National Tourism Agency designated Yingxiu a ""5A"" tourist attraction, the nation's highest rating, in the hope of drawing visitors.

The local government also provided financial incentives for the private sector. Yi Mi Yang Guang (A Ray of Sunshine), the company behind the redevelopment of Lijiang -- a World Heritage Site in Yunnan Province that harnessed tourism after an earthquake in 1996 -- answered the call. The company set up a branch in Wenchuan, the county that includes Yingxiu, and opened a new resort with facilities including teahouses, bars and a sunbathing area, with a 40-year lease. But the project faltered, closing in 2012 after losing money.

Even as outside businesses were leaving, residents with few other economic options were buying into the tourism plan, converting their homes into guesthouses and opening restaurants. But without the large number of tourists predicted, many have since closed.

In trying to replicate the success of Lijiang, the authorities ""went completely against the laws of the market,"" said Wang Chen, a prominent artist and Yingxiu resident. The plans did not take into account the geographical factors -- especially climate and location -- that made Lijiang's regeneration possible.

One major factor has been that Yingxiu is close to Chengdu and other regional attractions, such as the city of Dujiangyan, the Jiuzhaigou valley and the Wolong Panda Reserve, but has comparatively less to offer. Most tourists arriving in Yingxiu spend an hour or two at the earthquake memorial before heading on. They may stop for lunch, but few stay for dinner or overnight.

""After seeing the ruins, [visitors] just want to leave,"" said Wang. ""But after a tourist leaves, they are not contributing to tourism revenue."" Today, the only outside business that remains from the town's hopeful days of renewal is the Cha Xiang Zi tea company.

The town's lack of tourism staying power is also due to its singular focus on the earthquake. The main attraction is the ruins of Xuankou school. There is also a public cemetery for thousands of bodies recovered from the rubble (many were never found), an earthquake museum, attractions such as an earthquake simulation facility, and lessons in survival skills given by actors wearing the uniforms of crisis response teams.

Wang has ideas to diversify the tourism economy. At a local political meeting earlier this year, he suggested expanding the town's tourism area to the mountains that surround it, which include part of the route of the ""Long March"" of insurgent communist troops in 1934-1935 and part of the ancient Tea Horse trade route. But, he said, it would have been much easier to do this 10 years ago, when the country's attention was still focused on Yingxiu.

Despite the gloomy outlook, there is one steadfast group of returning visitors to the town. Members of the Chinese Communist Party and associated organizations make regular pilgrimages to Yingxiu to see what they consider a model of successful state-led disaster response and reconstruction. On the surface, at least, the immaculate town fits this narrative.

A woman looks at exhibits at the earthquake museum. (Photo by Yang Junzhe)

The earthquake museum that sits above the main town provides a clue to what draws the party faithful: While artefacts of the disaster are placed throughout, the vast majority of exhibits focus on the response of the CCP, with separate sections devoted to the actions of state media, military and medical staff, and to the communist leaders who visited.

In May 2010, Sichuan's then-party secretary, Liu Qibao, declared during a visit that Yingxiu would become a ""world-famous township."" The next year, a column in The People's Daily called the town's reconstruction ""mind-blowing.""

Beneath the uplifting narrative, however, is an undercurrent of dissatisfaction about how the local government spent the reconstruction funds and how little say the purported beneficiaries had in the process.

""Visitors think we've gotten a lot of money from the [local] government, but what was donated from the volunteers -- we didn't get any of it,"" said a woman who lost her eldest son in the middle school collapse. She now sells souvenirs to tourists to support eight-year-old twins born after the earthquake.

On May 12, visitors will flood into Yingxiu, drawn by its commemoration celebrations. ""Everything has been booked months in advance,"" one guesthouse owner said gleefully.

BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The six circuit courts of the Supreme People's Court (SPC) accepted 2,922 civil, administrative and criminal cases in the first three months of this year, according to the SPC Monday.

The cases accounted for 67.2 percent of the total cases of these types accepted by the SPC.

The circuit courts concluded 1,909 cases in the same period, accounting for 67.91 percent of total such cases concluded by the SPC. A total of 8,355 petitions were handled by the circuit courts, accounting for 78.92 percent of petitions handled by the SPC, the court said.

The SPC circuit courts are permanent trial courts set to exercise power on behalf of the SPC. Circuit court judgements and decisions are equal to those made by the SPC.

China currently has six SPC circuit courts, one each in Shenzhen, Shenyang, Nanjing, Zhengzhou, Chongqing and Xi'an.

Compared with the first three months of last year, courts across China accepted 627,000 more cases. The proportion of concluded cases compared to accepted cases rose by 4.02 percentage points year on year, the SPC said.

Since the beginning of the year, courts nationwide have been working to conclude cases to reduce protracted cases and improve trial quality and efficiency, the SPC said.","Tue, 08 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",,"['chinese', 'cases', 'courts', 'total', 'spc', 'judicial', 'circuit', 'efficiency', 'trial', 'xinhua', 'facilitate', 'accepted', 'concluded', 'court']",

AAP film review



SIFF Review — The transformation that China has gone through in the first decade of the new millennium has been extraordinary. While the urban landscape in China’s metropolis make lucrative ventures for capitalists, the interior terrain of the inhabitants may just be of interest only to those concerned with the human psyche. Chinese-American filmmaker Cathy Yan has chosen a slick and comedic styling to highlight the human perspective of modernization, with backdrop aptly in the megapolis of Shanghai.

In this her directorial debut feature, Yan has created a high energy concoction that is a fusion of colorful comedy and realistic drama. The comedic genre allows her to satirize and exaggerate, and she takes advantage of those elements effectively. “Dead Pigs” won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance earlier this year for Dramatic Ensemble Acting.

Born in China, Yan grew up in Hong Kong and Washington, D.C. She is a graduate of Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of International and Public Affairs and NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts graduate film program. Before filmmaking, Yan was a reporter for the Wall Street Journal in New York, Hong Kong and Beijing.

The feature is executive produced by the prominent Chinese arthouse filmmaker Jia Zhangke (A Touch of Sin, 2013). Interestingly, a couple years ago he had also backed another new director on the same subject matter of modernization in China with the production of “Life After Life” (2016). “Dead Pigs” is a much lighter and colorful take on the theme with a postmodern styling. The film is a selection in the China Stars Showcase at the 44th Seattle International Film Festival, May 17 – June 10.

Five lives in Greater Shanghai intersect as their stories are tactfully woven together. A pig farmer, Old Wang (Haoyu Yang), living in the outskirt of the City suddenly finds his pigs die of unknown reason. With no means to deal with the aftermath, he throws his dead pigs into the river. In dire financial needs, Old Wang appeals to his sister Candy Wang (Vivian Wu) for help but is right-out refused. A feisty owner of a beauty salon in Shanghai, Candy is on top of her game. Her business attracts loyal customers and sustains a fleet of dedicated staff, whom she trains with military cadence in aerobics formation, shouting out calls of positivity and team work.

While Candy enjoys a bustling business, she has to deal with a problem with her ancestral, family home in which she still lives. The house is designated to be torn down in a piece of land planned for a new development. As the last house standing among the rubble, Candy refuses to sell to the developers despite their lucrative offer and the urging of his financially strapped brother.

Project architect Sean Landry (David Rysdahl) personally visits Candy to sway her but to no avail. In return, he is given an object lesson as Candy shows him the pigeons she keeps in a cage outside her house. She hands him one as a gift. Releasing the pigeon as he steps away from a distance, Sean watches it fly straight back to Candy’s house. Home is where the bird will fly back to even when set free.

Cut to the dimmed color lights of an upscale Shanghai nightclub where the rich escape numbing boredom and flaunt their wealth, we see a young waiter Wang Zhen (Mason Lee, a tidbit: son of director Ang Lee) secretly nurtures a love for a regular customer, Xia Xia (Meng Li), the daughter of a powerful businessman. Here we have the realistic drama of what seems to be a tale of unrequited love due to differences in class and wealth. But twists and turns draw these two together. And still on another trajectory, the young man is connected to the pig farmer. Yan handles this subplot with nuanced sensitivity.

The screenplay is based on a real event in 2013 when up to 16,000 dead pigs were found dumped into the Huangpu River upstream of Shanghai. Yan uses that incident as the backdrop of her story and boldly exposes the fact that, while economic modernization is being touted by the power on top inducing money to flood in for development, the building of the massively needed social, health, and ethical infra-structures just cannot keep up. Yan’s film embeds multiple issues and raises flags of caution. Again, kudos to the writer director, the comedic handling disperses any dark clouds of moralizing.

As the film moves towards the end, the touch of comedy has gone overboard to a farcical treatment, and the finale, a mass karaoke singing is like a parody of a Bollywood finish. Yet, the very last scene wins. What are siblings for if not to act as target for bickering?

From what looks like a new wave of Chinese American filmmakers emerging in recent years, Yan is chosen by Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment to helm an upcoming “Harley Quinn” flick with Margot Robbie (“Suicide Squad”, 2016) reprising her role. With this new production, Yan will make history as the first female Asian to direct a superhero movie. Looks like “Dead Pigs” is a debut to a promising career for the director.

“Dead Pigs” will screen at the 44th Seattle International Film Festival May 18 and 19. For details and tickets click here.

NAIROBI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Stanbic Bank Kenya and the Industrial Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) on Tuesday launched an initiative to promote tourism and trade between the two countries by offering incentives for travelling, shopping and leisure to tourists visiting the two countries.

Charles Mudiwa, Chief Executive of Stanbic Bank Kenya told a media briefing in Nairobi that under the ""I Go Kenya, I Go China"" loyalty program, Chinese tourists visiting Kenya will receive discounts and special offers whenever they use ICBC cards at selected travel, hospitality and lifestyle merchants in the country.

Mudiwa noted that Kenyan tourists visiting China will also enjoy similar incentives when using Stanbic Bank Kenya cards.

""I believe that the 'I Go Kenya, I Go China' initiative will deepen relations between Kenya and China by encouraging visits between the two countries, ultimately boosting investment flows. This is good for the tourism industry and the economy as well,"" Mudiwa said.

Stanbic Bank is a member of the Standard Bank Group whose largest shareholder is ICBC with a 20.1 percent shareholding.

The ""I Go Kenya, I Go China"" loyalty program follows the launch of a similar credit card offering between Standard Bank Group and ICBC in November 2017 in South Africa for their respective cardholders travelling between the two countries.

Mudiwa noted that the two firms are working together to further expand the loyalty program to other African countries this year.

Guo Ce, the Economic and Commercial Consular at the Chinese Embassy in Kenya, said that the partnership between Stanbic Bank Kenya and ICBC is a symbol of the growing Sino-Kenyan cooperation.

Guo said that in recent years, the bilateral cooperation has resulted in remarkable benefits for the people of the two countries.

He added that total bilateral trade hit approximately 3.8 billion U.S. dollars in 2017 while 400 Chinese companies have so far been established in Kenya and have employed some 120,000 locals.

The Chinese diplomat said that Chinese firms have been involved in over 100 mega projects in Kenya including in the construction and finance of the Standard Gauge Railway that will play a significant role in making the country, a regional logistical hub.

Guo added that the 'I Go Kenya, I Go China' initiative will encourage more Chinese tourists to visit Kenya, noting that Kenya is well placed to be a major tourist destination due to its excellent wildlife resources as well as beach destinations.

Lincoln Mali, Standard Bank's Group Head of Card and Emerging Payment, said that China has emerged as a key economic partner for Africa in recent years.

He said that through the ""I Go Kenya, I Go China"" program and in partnership with ICBC, there will be strengthening of relations between the two countries by encouraging exchange of visits.

Data from the Kenya Tourism Board indicates that in 2017, China was among the top five tourism source markets contributing 5.5 percent of the traffic.

Sun Gang, the Deputy CEO of ICBC Africa, said that China and Kenya have been long good friends who have been working together for a shared prosperous future.

""Such friendship is manifested in political equality, economic cooperation and win-win results as well as cultural exchanges,"" Sun said.","Tue, 15 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",,"['chinese', 'stanbic', 'standard', 'bank', 'promote', 'trade', 'chinas', 'program', 'tourism', 'tourists', 'xinhua', 'seek', 'icbc', 'kenya', 'china']", 
94,94,FL-2018-000051-CHN,River Forecast Centre upgrades number of B.C. waterways on flood watch - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/river-forecast-centre-upgrades-number-of-b-c-waterways-on-flood-watch-1.3918861,"VANCOUVER -- The rapid melting of some of the highest snowpacks in British Columbia's history is causing flooding across the province, said provincial river watchers.

David Campbell, head of the B.C. River Forecast Centre, said Monday there are several areas in the province where the snowpack is over 150 per cent of its normal rate, including the Okanagan, where it was measured at 206 per cent, one of the highest rates seen since recording of snowpacks began in the 1980s.

A state of local emergency was expanded across Kelowna on Monday afternoon, the Okanagan region's largest city.

Campbell said because of the delayed melt season in some areas, higher snowpack values have been seen and that could mean more water in the rivers later this month.

The warm weather and up to 15 millimetres of rain forecast for mid-week could be enough to create higher flows when combined with the snow melts, which make the situation worse for areas already under flood watches, said Campbell.

""There might be some more high pressure ridge development later in the week and into the weekend, then we really transition back into that rapid melt,"" said Campbell. ""Certainly the outset of this week could be another challenging week in terms of flows across the Interior.""

Campbell said the average snowpack when measured May 1 was 168% above normal across the province, up from 127% when it was measured on April 1.

Chris Duffy, executive director for programs at Emergency Management BC, confirmed there were 17 states of local emergency, eight band council resolutions for alerts or orders, 21 evacuation orders affecting 187 homes and 22 evacuation alerts covering 585 homes.

He said they've deployed two million sandbags in flood watch areas and borrowed sandbag-making machines from Saskatchewan.

The tip of the day would be to stay clear of swollen rivers and other floodwaters, Duffy said.

""With regards to staying safe, staying out of floodwaters, not walking through that, keeping clear of banks and streams with children and pets.""

Officials said evacuation orders in the Nazko Valley were expected to be downgraded to evacuation alerts as of Tuesday, where nearly 120 properties were ordered evacuated for almost a week.","Mon, 07 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.3908976.1525121892!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,"['flood', 'emergency', 'areas', 'centre', 'forecast', 'number', 'evacuation', 'week', 'watch', 'measured', 'waterways', 'province', 'staying', 'snowpack', 'bc', 'alerts', 'upgrades', 'river', 'orders']", 
95,95,FL-2018-000051-CHN,Patients flood USC with reports about doctor accused of misconduct; LAPD set to review cases - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-usc-doctor-firings-20180518-story.html,"The University of Southern California said Friday it has received about 200 reports from former patients of gynecologist Dr. George Tyndall in the wake of a Los Angeles Times investigation detailing years of misconduct complaints and is establishing a process to forward some of those accounts to the Los Angeles Police Department for criminal review.

In a somber letter to the university community sent Friday, USC President C.L. Max Nikias said he has personally read reports from Tyndall’s patients over “many difficult hours” and that it left him profoundly disturbed.

“The former physician’s behavior distresses us deeply. He should have been removed and referred to the authorities years ago,” he wrote. “Once again, I want to personally apologize to any student who visited our student health center and was made to feel uncomfortable in any way. You deserved better, and we let you down.”

The letter came the day after the university ousted two top administrators at the clinic where Tyndall practiced for nearly three decades.

The lead physician at the Engemann Student Health Center, Dr. William Leavitt, confirmed he was fired Thursday afternoon and said he was not informed of the reasons for his termination. Tammie Akiyoshi, the clinical director at the health center, was also fired, sources said.

The terminations come as outrage grows both on and outside the USC campus over the university’s handling of Tyndall and as more former patients step forward with disturbing stories about their treatment while studying at the university.

Leavitt, a physician at USC since 1991, said in a brief phone interview Friday that “I’m basically the scapegoat… From my perspective it’s a wrongful termination.”

USC said this week that complaints about Tyndall dating to the early 2000s reached Dr. Larry Neinstein, the late executive director of the clinic, but he “

handled patient complaints independently.” The university said it was unclear why Tyndall was allowed to remain in his position.

Leavitt said that Neinstein, who died in 2016, was being unfairly blamed, and he dismissed USC’s portrayal of his management.

“Dr. Neinstein never did anything without consulting the people above him,” Leavitt told The Times.

Michael Jackson, vice president for student affairs and one of Neinstein’s supervisors through 2013, said in a statement that Neinstein “never shared with me information about behavior that is cited in the recent L.A. Times articles about Dr. Tyndall. Had Dr. Neinstein ever shared that kind of information with me, I would have promptly reported it to USC’s General Counsel Office and the Provost’s Office for their review.”

The Times reported that Akiyoshi had received several complaints from a nurse about lewd remarks and inappropriate pelvic exams by Tyndall, the sole full-time gynecologist at the clinic. Akiyoshi could not be reached for comment.

Todd Dickey, USC’s senior vice president for administration, said in a statement: “In light of newly received patient complaints indicating the extent of George Tyndall’s inappropriate conduct, the university has decided to remove Tyndall’s direct supervisor and another senior supervisor from the student health center. The university does not take personnel decisions lightly, but will hold people accountable for their supervision and inaction.”

The complaints about Tyndall’s behavior from co-workers and patients date to at least 2000, according to USC, which admitted this week that the physician should have been forced out of his job years ago. Other patients alleged that the misconduct was occurring from the early 1990s.

Some of the most serious allegations against Tyndall involve claims of inappropriate remarks about patients’ bodies and his use of fingers at the start of pelvic exams. Witnesses told The Times that the physician frequently inserted one finger and then a second in patients, telling them he was trying to see if a speculum would fit inside.

Cindy Gilbert, a supervising nurse, became frustrated by Akiyoshi and other administrators. In June 2016, Gilbert reported Tyndall to the campus rape crisis center.

Tyndall was removed from the clinic in the wake of Gilbert’s report, and he was placed on paid leave for nearly one year. An internal investigation determined that his pelvic exams were outside the scope of accepted medical practice and amounted to sexual harassment of patients.

USC reached a secret deal with Tyndall last summer that allowed him to resign with a financial payout. Administrators did not report him at the time to the state medical board, which investigates problem doctors. The university acknowledged this week that not reporting him was a mistake and said it had filed a belated complaint in March.

In earlier interviews, the 71-year-old physician denied that he acted improperly and said his pelvic exams were thorough and appropriate. He did not respond to several messages seeking comment this week and could not be reached Friday.

Gilbert reiterated Friday that she told Akiyoshi about Tyndall about a half-dozen times.

“Anyone who knew that it was going on and didn’t act on it should be held responsible,” she said.

The trail of allegations against Tyndall has grown since The Times published its report, making headlines around the world. Gilbert said the public’s attention was overdue.

“I’m glad that it came out, but I’m sad that it took so long,” she said.

In his letter Friday, Nikias said the university was reviewing the student reports about Tyndall and was developing a process to get them to the LAPD, with the consent of the patients. LAPD Capt. Billy Hayes confirmed that USC has been in contact with the department but said no reports about Tyndall have been filed.

The university said Friday it was offering “personalized support and counseling” for those who come forward and stressed the clinic was under new leadership.

Nikias issued a public apology Tuesday, noting that his two daughters attended the university and calling Tyndall’s conduct “a shameful betrayal of our values.”

The university said Wednesday that Nikias first learned of the complaints against Tyndall late last fall, months after the doctor had resigned. USC did not reach out to patients who had been treated by Tyndall until Tuesday, after The Times presented the university with its findings.

The firings appeared to have not quelled calls for more sweeping accountability at the private university. Rini Sampath, a 2016 graduate and the former student body president, launched a Change.org petition demanding the the Board of Trustees remove Nikias. As of Friday evening, more than 400 people had signed.

In an interview, Sampath, 23, said she was disgusted by the allegations against Tyndall.

“Everyone is outraged,” Sampath said. “People are upset. And they are looking for avenues to make change.”

Tiana Lowe, 22, who graduated from USC last week, said the university must move against anyone who knew about Tyndall’s behavior and didn’t take action.

“If people knew about this for five years and did nothing, at every level there needs to be some trimming of the fat. It’s important that people realize multiple levels were complicit,” she said.

The university’s handling of the incident has left her outraged. And she is not alone. Even the Chinese government issued a statement regarding its deep concern about the scandal, citing former colleagues who told The Times that Tyndall seemed to mistreat international students, especially those from China.

“The consulate has every right to be furious,” Lowe added.

Times staff writer Richard Winton contributed to this report.

Heavy rains have increased water levels in the Cauca, which feeds the Ituango Dam in Antioquia province, the country's largest-ever hydroelectric project. Problems with filling mechanisms and tunnels at the dam have authorities on high alert.

“We are working jointly with all institutions on the worst-case scenario, which is the breaking of the dam, which would provoke a huge flood in down-river municipalities,"" said Jorge Londono, the head of Empresas Publicas de Medellin, the public utility company that owns the dam.

“That's a catastrophic scenario,” Londono added.

The dam, which has not yet begun power generation, has cost nearly $4 billion to build and is meant to generate 17 percent of Colombia's electricity needs. A total of 4,985 people from down-river areas were moved to shelters away from the flood zone, the Andean country's disaster agency said in a statement.

Cork City Council last night voted by 22-6 to approve the public realm project for Morrison’s Island off the South Mall in the city centre, which includes plans by the Office of Public Works (OPW) to protect the area as part of its€140 million Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme.

The vote at last night’s city council meeting followed a 90-minute debate by councillors and the decision was welcomed by Lord Mayor of Cork, Cllr Tony Fitzgerald, who pointed out that some 80 per cent of city centre flooding originates with tidal flooding at Morrison’s Island.

“This scheme will deliver a high-quality public amenity space for a long-neglected area of the city, but also the required level of flood protection for the wider city centre. Tonight’s vote will be warmly welcomed by traders who have suffered enormously in previous flooding events,” he said.

Much tidal flooding

Details of the plan were unveiled in February when the then Cork City Council director of the environment, David Joyce, explained that Morrison’s Island was critical to any flood protection scheme for Cork as it was the source of much tidal flooding in the city centre.

When tidal flooding on the South Channel of the River Lee overspills on to Morrison’s Quay and Fr Mathew Quay, it flows down Fr Mathew Street and on to the South Mall and across Princes Street, Cook Street and Marlboro Street, on to Oliver Plunkett Street, he said.

Ken Leahy of Arup explained the flood protection measures along the 550 metre stretch of quays from Parliament Bridge past Trinity Bridge down to Parnell Bridge would involve raising road levels by 600mm and reshaping the camber of the road so it runs from the river towards the buildings.

The actual flood defences would consist of raising quay walls by 300-600mm, composed of concrete with granite coping and bollards, before erecting 1.2 metres of steel cabling which would allow pedestrians and cyclists using a 3m-wide promenade to have an excellent view of the river.

Mr Leahy said the plan would also involve reducing the amount of cars using the area, with the number of car-parking spaces on Morrison’s Quay and Fr Mathew Quay being cut from 148 to 33 – a loss of 115 parking spaces – as the plan seeks to attract more pedestrians and cyclists into the area.

Strongly criticised

The loss of 115 parking spaces in the plan was strongly criticised by the Cork Business Association (CBA) in April, with chief executive Lawrence Owens saying it represented “the single greatest elimination of parking spaces in the history of Cork city centre”.

Mr Owens said the CBA had estimated that the 115 parking spaces accommodated 2,500 to 3,000 turnovers a week and almost 150,000 turnovers a year – a serious loss of customers to a city still recovering from recession, a crippling bus strike and two major weather events.

Meanwhile, the flood protection element of the scheme has come under fire from the Save Cork City group, which is opposed to the OPW flood relief scheme and went so far as to organise an international design competition to come up with alternative plans for the Morrison’s Island area.

Architect Seán Antóin Ó Muirí of the Save Cork City group said people were fundamentally opposed to the current OPW plan as it was overly reliant on the building of 5km of concrete walls, which would reduce public access to both the north and south channels of the River Lee.","Tue, 15 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.3496397&origw=1204,"['flood', 'street', 'plan', '6m', 'city', 'project', 'quay', 'public', 'remove', '80', 'cork', 'council', 'morrisons', 'risk', 'spaces', 'flooding', 'backs']",

An aerial view of the new homes built in Jintai Village, Sichuan Province Photo: IC





Ten years ago in Wenchuan, Southwest China's Sichuan Province, people were going about a normal afternoon when suddenly a huge earthquake rocked the region. Reaching 8.0 in magnitude, the earthquake destroyed countless buildings over a more than hundred-thousand-square-kilometer area and led to the deaths of over 80,000 people, making it one of the most destructive earthquakes to hit the country after the founding of the People's Republic of China.



On Saturday, a decade after the earthquake, commemorative activities were held throughout China to remember those that lost their lives or were injured, but more importantly, to celebrate the rebirth of this area.



New houses and schools have been built, businesses are prospering and people have returned to their normal lives. Many people have contributed to this success.



Among them all, John Lin and Joshua Bolchover are two contributors that should not be forgotten, as the duos' Rural Urban Framework (RUF) helped provide affordable housing to locals in need.



Village renewal



One of the areas that was severely impacted by the disaster, Jintai Village is located near the city of Bazhong in Sichuan Province. Adding to the tragedy, the misfortune that the village experienced wasn't limited to the earthquake. Following the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, the village was subsequently damaged again by a decimating flood and accompanied landslides in 2011. This was a terrible blow to locals, many of whom had just moved into newly rebuilt homes.



Seeing people in need, RUF moved in to work with NGOs and the local government to help the community.



""We thought that in addition to being able to help out the community, it was a valuable opportunity to take part in designing an entire village from scratch and reflect on its significance and potentiality,"" Crystal Kwan, the project leader for RUF's Jintai Village Reconstruction Project told the Global Times.



A solution was quickly worked out. Instead of simply copying the designs of the residents' original homes or following common urban designs, the team decided to come up with new buildings that would be in fitting with the unique lifestyle of the village.



""We hoped to offer an alternative solution that would not only preserve the authenticity of the village but also help foster a sense of self-reliance and community-living,"" Kwan noted.



In order to insure the safety of the houses, Lin and Bolchover gave up on traditional square shaped homes, instead going with irregular shaped buildings with an inclined and terraced roof.



""We rejected the easier way of tabula rasa and instead we terraced the site in order to follow the existing topography as much as possible,"" Kwan explained.



Making full use of space, designers turned everyone's roof into a small garden that could be used for farming. Taking into the watering and temperature needed for the plants, the architects worked high-tech solar panels and a private rainwater collection system into the design to help make residents' lives as cost efficient as possible.



Perfect blend



""Second we valued a lot the relationship of the houses with the surrounding natural environment,"" Kwan explained.



""In a rural village, you have to feel yourself being in the landscape; architecture and landscape should be more blended in with each other.""



According to Kwan, one of RUF's goals was to incorporate the natural environment into the house, such as natural light, air circulation and view of the surroundings. At the same time, they emphasized the dialogue between the homes and its residents.



As a result, one can now find in the village homes that perfectly blend into the local environment to become a part of the rural view. Families are able to sell their home-grown vegetables and fruits at stalls by their front doors, while livestock that once defecated on the street, now enjoy ""private toilets"" that collect their droppings and turn it into usable methane.



Besides the natural environment, Kwan also believes that the house and village design has to be relevant to the villagers' rural livelihood as well.



""It is important not only to improve their lives but also to inform a new way of living.""



With this in mind, the designers also built a community center where residents can get together to chat with family and friends.



Like the homes, the roof of the building can be used for farming, while an open space below the roof provides a place the dwellers can rest in the shade.



The spacious design makes it a great place for community meetings or spontaneous get-togethers among members of the community.



""We often strive to plan the project so that the whole village can benefit from it. Instead of just satisfying the program needs, we want the project to integrate into the village and people's lives,"" Kwan noted.","Mon, 14 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.globaltimes.cn/images/gfavicon.ico,"['instead', 'help', 'redesigns', 'natural', 'kwan', 'program', 'aid', 'homes', 'project', 'wenchuan', 'village', 'earthquake', 'rural', 'lives', 'devastated']",
