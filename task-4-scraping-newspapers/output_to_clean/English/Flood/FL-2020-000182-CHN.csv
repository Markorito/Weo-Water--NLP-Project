Flooding on the Yangtze River peaked again this week, in Sichuan Province and the sprawling metropolis of Chongqing, while the Three Gorges Dam, 280 miles downstream, reached its highest level since it began holding water in 2003.

This year’s flooding has unfolded not as a single natural disaster, with an enormous loss of life and property, but rather as a slow, merciless series of smaller ones, whose combined toll has steadily mounted even as official reports have focused on the government’s relief efforts.

“The Chinese nation has fought natural disasters for thousands of years, gaining precious experience,” the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, declared on Tuesday after a visit to Anhui, another flooded province downstream from the Three Gorges Dam. “We should continue to fight.”","Tue, 25 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/21/world/21china-floods-1/21china-floods-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"['yangtze', 'natural', 'challenges', 'leaders', 'covid', 'downstream', 'week', 'water', 'visit', 'flooding', 'province', 'dam', 'xi', 'face', 'gorges', 'chinas']",

Heavy seasonal rainfall, which has caused the worst flooding in decades across China's interior, forced officials at the Three Gorges Dam on Wednesday to open all 10 spillways for the first-time ever in an effort to control rising water on a reservoir along the Yangtze River.

Since June, China has been battling a series of devastating floods, stretching from the country's southwestern interior to its east coast. Officials are calling it the worst since 1981, with estimates of $25 billion worth of damage and the displacement of millions of people.

China's Ministry of Water Resources on Tuesday raised the emergency response in hardest-hit Sichuan province to its highest level, according to China Global Television Network.

The People's Daily newspaper said the Three Gorges reservoir is seeing inflow of 72,000 cubic meters (nearly 20 million gallons) per second, the highest level since the reservoir was opened in 2003, the ministry said, with more water expected in coming days.

About 100,000 people have been evacuated in Sichuan. Authorities reportedly dispatched helicopters to rescue those stranded by the rising waters.

In the southern part of the province, where the Min and Dadu rivers join, the flooding lapped at the toes of the Leshan Giant Buddha statue — a major tourist attraction in the region. The 8th-century statue, carved out of a sandstone cliff face, is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It's the first time water has reached the statue's toes since 1949, the same year as the communist victory that created the People's Republic of China.

Police, volunteers and staff at the statue, located outside Chengdu, stacked sandbags in an effort to hold the flood waters back from the the 71-meter (233-foot) tall landmark, CCTV reported.

The Three Gorges Dam, part of a massive hydroelectric project completed in 2003, was meant to tame Yangtze flooding. However, its reservoir lake has been 10 meters (32 feet) above its critical flood level for more than a month, according to Reuters.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong and Macau had been bracing for Typhoon Higos, which looked to have southern China in its sights. However, Hong Kong's Observatory cancelled its typhoon warning on Wednesday as the storm moved away from the city.

China's state media also reported recently that landslides backed up a river in Gansu province at the city of Longnan, trapping 48 people on rooftops.","Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/08/19/gettyimages-1228102265_wide-888cf9877e9079160fe142a74c1ff7b09b52172b.jpg?s=1400,"['reservoir', 'images', 'image', 'media', 'getty', '100000', 'water', 'flooding', 'giant', 'evacuated', 'statue', 'toggle', 'china', 'mediabarcroft', 'gorges', 'massive', 'ancient', 'threatens', 'buddha']", 
2,2,FL-2020-000182-CHN,"China's flooding slams rare earth, fertilizer and other industries - Nikkei Asian Review",https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/China-s-flooding-slams-rare-earth-fertilizer-and-other-industries,"SHANGHAI -- Weeks of flooding along the Yangtze River, China's longest waterway, has crippled commodity production, weighing on an economy that has been shaking off the coronavirus downturn.

Though authorities have not revealed total economic losses caused by the deluge of rain since June, several companies whose production plants have been submerged have ceased operations.

Sichuan-based Shenghe Resources, one of China's few rare earth production companies, on Wednesday said floods have damaged fixed assets, including equipment and inventory at two plants.

The Shanghai-listed group is projecting an initial loss of between 390 million yuan and 520 million yuan ($56 million to $75 million), though the water has prevented company personnel from entering the premises to gauge actual destruction.

One of the plants in 2019 produced 28,227 tons of rare earth saline and accounted for about 8% of the group's operating income. The material is one of 17 metals vital in the production of smartphones and other electronic devices. The company's stock price fell to 7.90 yuan on Monday, 11% lower than a week earlier.

China produced 132,000 tons of rare earth minerals last year, accounting for nearly two-thirds of global production, according to the China Industrial Information website.

Sichuan Hebang Biotechnology, a fertilizer maker, announced on Thursday that its plant had been submerged. Losses due to production line and inventory damages are estimated at 350 million yuan. Sichuan Hebang Biotechnology and Fuhua Group account for 24% of China's production of phosphate ore, according to Everbright Securities analysts who also said uncertainty remains as to when production can restart. Phosphate ore is a mineral widely used in the making of fertilizer and animal feed.

The flooding has also affected leather producer Sichuan Zhenjing, whose 157,000-sq.-meter factory has been inundated with water. The company, which supplies auto and shoemakers, said it will take three months before it can resume operations.

Heavy rainfall has affected millions of people along the Yangtze, which cuts through central China, and drawn the attention of the country's top leaders. President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang last week visited areas affected by floods, promising greater flood control and economic support. State TV showed Li in rubber boots in ankle-high water talking to victims in Chongqing, a centrally located city with a population of more than 30 million.

Although several dams in the country, notably the Three Gorges in Hubei Province, have withstood high water levels, people living downstream are living with anxiety. The Three Gorges has had to put its back up against a record-level of inflows this summer; on Thursday, it opened its gates to 75,000 cu. meters of water per second.

The Ministry of Emergency Management warned on Saturday that levels along key waterways remained high and ordered local governments to remain on alert for more rain to come through Tuesday.

Another storm is on the way. The China Meteorological Administration on Sunday issued an alert for Typhoon Bavi, which is expected to hit the country's southern region on Wednesday.

China recorded a better-than-expected economic growth rate of 3.2% in the second quarter, but some economists now doubt whether that pace can be sustained. S&P Global Ratings in a report on Aug. 17 said economic data for July indicates that growth had relied on government support.","Mon, 24 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F5%252F3%252F8%252F4%252F28974835-1-eng-GB%252FRTX7L31T.JPG?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['rare', 'slams', 'economic', 'affected', 'industries', 'production', 'china', 'water', 'yuan', 'flooding', 'fertilizer', 'earth', 'million', 'chinas']", 
3,3,FL-2020-000182-CHN,China's Summer of Floods is a Preview of Climate Disasters to Come - InsideClimate News,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/17082020/china-floods-climate-change-extreme-weather/,"In early July, high school seniors across China were scheduled to sit for the gaokao, the grueling two-day national exam that determines their college fate. But when torrential rain suddenly hit Anhui province’s Shexian county, streets turned into rivers, preventing local students from reaching their testing sites.

Shop owners were also hit by the deluge. Wu Yongqiang told China One Day, a Tencent Media Chinese-languge blog, that he arrived at his tea shop to find his loose-leaf varieties steeping in muddy flood water—he estimated that 90 percent of his merchandise was ruined.

Similar scenes of devastation have played out across China, particularly in the central Yangtze River Basin, over the last two months as the summer monsoon has unleashed record rains and floods. Millions of lives have been upended this summer, but climate experts warn that China will face more frequent severe floods as the global temperature rises, driving up the number of intense rainstorms in the country.

China shares this fate with many nations: 70 percent of the world’s population is expected to experience greatly increased river flooding if global warming goes unchecked. This summer alone, flooding along the Brahmaputra river has displaced about 3 million people in India, and one quarter of Bangladesh is underwater. Lower-income countries like India will have a higher mortality rate from flooding compared to China, according to a 2018 study, but China will also be greatly impacted.

Researchers project that, in terms of damage and the number of people impacted, China is the country most vulnerable to flooding if the temperature rises 4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, roughly the warming projected for the end of the century if action isn’t taken to curb global warming.

China’s flood-prone Yangtze River Basin is densely populated by factories, towns and cities. The government has invested in hulking engineering projects to control the floods, but rapid urbanization, degraded ecosystems, and deep inequities pose major challenges to China’s adaptation.

This Summer’s Record-Setting Floods

Flooding is typical in Southern, Central and Eastern China during the meiyu, or “plum rain”—the East Asian wet season that runs from June to August, but this year’s floods have been historic. Starting in June, heavy downpours and floods started hitting provinces in the Yangtze River Basin including Hubei, Hunan, Anhui and Jiangxi.

The middle and lower basin’s rainfall from June through mid-July was the highest on record since 1961, according to Wang Zhihua, a spokesperson for China’s Meteorological Administration. Thirty-three rivers recorded record high flows, and the water level in 433 rivers was above the flood control line as of mid-July.

The floods have had a broad impact. By the end of July, almost 55 million people had been affected across 27 provinces—3.8 million people had evacuated and 158 people were dead or missing, according to China’s Ministry of Emergency Management. The effect of the floods on people’s livelihoods is still being accounted for, but the direct economic losses were estimated to be $20.7 billion at the end of July.

The flood risk has waned along the Yangtze River, but the season isn’t over—the upper reaches of the river were hit with another round of floods last week. Beijing and other parts of northern China are also starting to face heavy rainfall now as the weather front moves north.

The Growing Threat of Flooding

China has dealt with flooding throughout its history, but climate change is upping the threat level. As temperatures rise, extreme rainfall will increase and floods will become more frequent in central and eastern China. Using climate models, researchers project that the historical 1-in-100 year high river flow will happen once every 50 to 60 years if the global temperature rises 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Limiting warming to below 2 degrees Celsius is the goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.

Once the temperature is elevated by 2 degrees, that extreme river flow will happen once every 25 to 35 years in China, according to the 2018 study published in Environmental Research Letters.

“Reaching 1.5 degrees already brings major repercussions in terms of high flows,” said Homero Paltan, a research associate at Oxford University who co-authored the study.

More analysis would have to be done to determine exactly how climate change factored into this summer’s floods, he said, but 2020’s wet monsoon conditions align with the trends in their study.

As climate change worsens flooding, a larger swath of China’s population will be vulnerable. A 2018 study published in Nature Climate Change projects that over 20 million additional people will be exposed to flooding annually in China if the global temperature rises 3 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial level.

Factories in the flood zone will also be increasingly impacted, along with the global supply of everything from laptops to air conditioners. A 2019 study published in Sustainability examined the impact of large floods on the Chinese manufacturing sector from 2003 to 2010 and found that these events reduced the output of firms by 28 percent annually.

The authors modeled how the impacts of a flood ripple out to affect the whole economy as supply chains are disrupted; they found a 12.3 percent loss in total economic output after large floods in China, with the economic impact still felt years later.

In the future, China’s economy will become more vulnerable, said Jim Hall, a climate risk expert at Oxford University who co-authored the study. “I’m sure there will be further investment in protection to reduce the hazard of flooding,” he said. “But the question is: Does that investment in flood protection keep up with the increasing scale of the risk?”

How is the Chinese Government Responding?

The Chinese government has acknowledged the role of climate change in increasing extreme flooding and has taken steps to tackle the mounting risks. In a CCTV interview on July 25, the deputy director of China’s National Climate Center, Jia Xiaolong described the increase in heavy rainfall days over the past decades and said, “I think the sustained heavy rainfall in the Yangtze River Basin is happening against the larger backdrop of global warming.”

Historically, China has tackled flooding by turning to gargantuan engineering projects like the Three Gorges Dam—the largest dam in the world. Completed in 2009, the dam was built in part to control the flooding on the Yangtze River. This summer, the dam has had to open its floodgates when the water in its reservoir rose too high. The dam has helped to decrease peak river flows, but it is not a panacea, according to Ding Xiangli, an environmental historian at the Rhode Island School of Design.

“Dams alone would not solve the flooding problem in China,” Ding said during a Harvard Fairbank Center webinar on the floods in China.

Alongside dams, a viable flood control system should consist of other tools including flood diversion storage basins, dykes and a resilient wetland system, which is lacking in contemporary China, he said.

Reflecting a move toward a broader approach to flood management, Chinese legislators are considering a draft law to protect the Yangtze River Basin and restore its ecosystems for flood control, The Economist reported.

On the city level, China has a sweeping plan with a cartoonish name: “sponge city.” The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development began promoting the concept in 2014, directing cities to capture rainfall rather than treating it as run-off in sewers that can be quickly overwhelmed during torrential downpours. Thirty pilot cities have received money from the central government to implement sponge city projects.

Under the sponge city umbrella , China’s State Council set a goal in 2015 for all of China’s cities to capture and reuse 70 percent of rainwater on site—a target they are supposed to meet in 20 percent of urban areas by 2020 and 80 percent of urban areas by 2030.

“China’s sponge city construction definitely has had a role in relieving urban waterlogging,” said Zou Tao, the director of sustainable city planning at the Tsinghua Urban Planning and Design Institute. As the program scales up its impact on reducing urban waterlogging will be clearer, he added.

Zou said cities should also increase their use of natural ecosystems to reduce flooding. On a broader scale, sponge city development needs to be integrated into regional flood management, Peking University professor Yu Kongjian told the China Economic Weekly in 2017.

Yu’s comment underlines an issue that has risen to the fore this flood season: China’s approach to flood control often exacerbates inequities between the country’s urban and rural areas. Rural land in Anhui province was submerged within 11 flood diversion areas in order to protect downstream cities, Sixth Tone reported. Similarly, in Jiangxi province, rural communities faced a deluge of water when the government opened levees to lower the level of Poyang Lake. “Sacrificing rural, less populated areas to protect major cities,” is the government’s flood control plan, said Ding Xiangli of the Rhode Island School of Design.

These communities are not fully compensated for the damage to their fields and houses, and Ding suggested that the central government and downstream cities should increase their compensation to poorer rural areas for the flood protection they are providing.

Flooded urban areas face their own economic struggles. In Anhui province’s Shexian county, the impact has been profound for some people. Tea shop owner Wu Yongqiang estimated tens of thousands of dollars in damage to his tea supplies. Another shopkeeper interviewed by China One Day said she was planning to retire in two years, but that is no longer possible.

“People should be aware that they are living in a risky area,” Oxford’s Homero Paltan said, “and the risk will become more frequent.”","Mon, 17 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://mk0insideclimats3pe4.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/china-flooding_feature-china-barcroft-media-getty.jpg,"['yangtze', 'preview', 'come', 'climate', 'china', 'flood', 'urban', 'flooding', 'disasters', 'floods', 'summer', 'cities', 'river', 'chinas']",

The water receded to 165 meters Monday after reaching 167.65 meters Saturday, the highest since the hydroelectric dam opened in 2003, Xinhua News Agency reported.

But the water line remains far above the 145-meter limit set to control flooding during the summer and fall rainy season.

Authorities remain vigilant as heavy rains are expected to persist upstream on the Yangtze River through Wednesday. Floodwaters have inundated parts of Sichuan Province, the metropolis of Chongqing and other areas upstream from the dam.

The floods have affected almost 4 million people and caused nearly 20 billion yuan ($2.89 billion) in direct damage, with crops and commercial buildings among the hardest hit.

Water levels have fallen in upstream cities, and floodwaters continue to recede from roads and other affected areas.

Days of heavy rain have already broken dikes and inundated towns in the central province of Sichuan, state media reported -- triggering fresh warnings around the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, which flows into the Three Gorges Dam.

Authorities in Sichuan on Tuesday raised the emergency alert to Level 1, the highest on a four-level warning scale, after the Qingyi River and its tributaries overflowed.

""More than half of the area of the town has been inundated,"" China Daily quoted a local official in Zizhong County as saying. ""The road leading to the town has been flooded and the town itself has become an isolated island.""

Since June, China has been grappling with a series of devastating floods concentrated in the southern and central regions. The water level at the Three Gorges Dam, one of the world's largest, touched a record high of 164.2 meters in late July. The maximum is 175 meters.

Now comes the seventh typhoon of the year, Typhoon Higos, which was generated by a tropical depression in the Philippines and is expected to hit the southern province of Guangdong on Wednesday. The Hong Kong Observatory warned on Tuesday of approaching rough seas and strengthening winds, advising against water sports and fishing in the open ocean.

Authorities are taking flood control measures at dams along the country's longest waterway, the Yangtze. At the Three Gorges Dam, floodwater discharge was raised to 44,000 cu. meters per second, up from 42,200, on Monday in anticipation of higher inflows from upstream rivers.

The relentless flooding has raised concerns about dam safety. ""As a result of the massive inflow of water, upstream dams are themselves under increasing stress, as flooding inundated their catchment areas,"" the Heritage Foundation, a U.S. think tank, said in an Aug. 5 report.

Around 55 million people in 27 of China's 31 provinces have been affected by the weeks of flooding, with at least 158 people killed or missing as of July 28, the Ministry of Emergency Management has said. Direct economic losses from flooding were estimated at 144 billion yuan ($20 billion), 14% higher than the five-year average.

These losses, which are expected to rise in the coming days, are only complicating China's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The country's consumer price index in July rose 2.7% on the year, picking up from 2.5% in June, partly due to pork price increases and the disasters.

""Accelerating food prices and overall CPI inflation leaves the authorities with even less scope"" for policy maneuvering, warned Enodo Economics in a research note on Monday.

Despite a better-than-expected economic growth rate of 3.2% in the second quarter, S&P Global Ratings stopped short of classifying China's recovery as self-sustaining.

LANZHOU, Aug. 23 (Xinhua) -- A spell of heavy rainfall has triggered floods in three rivers in northwest China's Gansu Province, local authorities said Sunday.

The province's water resources department said water has surpassed alert levels in Taohe River and Daxia River, two tributaries of the Yellow River, as well as in Bailong River, which flows into the Yangtze River, amid intense rain between Saturday and Sunday.

Gansu on Saturday initiated a Level II emergency response to floods, the second-highest in the country's four-tier emergency response system.

Rainstorms and floods have wreaked havoc in Gansu since Aug. 10, damaging 721 km of levees, of which 2.5 km gave way to floodwater. Over 1.2 million people have been affected.

Zhouqu County, among the hardest hit by rain-triggered floods, on Wednesday activated a top-level emergency response for flood control and natural disaster relief. In its Qugaona Township, roads were damaged, electricity and communication were cut off and more than 2,500 people were urgently evacuated.

11,11,FL-2020-000182-CHN,China flood forces Tongwei to cut polysilicon capacity by a quarter - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-solar-floods/china-flood-forces-tongwei-to-cut-polysilicon-capacity-by-a-quarter-idUKKCN25E0T1,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Tongwei Group, a Chinese feedstock and solar raw material supplier, is forced to shut down a quarter of its polycrystalline silicon, or polysilicon, capacity due to an unusually severe flood in southeastern China.

Tongwei’s polysilicon-focused subsidiary, Yongxiang Co, on Tuesday closed its 20,000-tonne plant in Leshan city in Sichuan province, as the city issued a Level I flood alert, the highest on its four-tier scale.

Polycrystalline silicon is a raw material used by the solar photovoltaic industry to make cells.

“The city is encountering a once-in-a-century flood. We received a notice this morning from local emergency management bureau to stop production immediately,” said a spokesman at Tongwei Group.

“We have evacuated all workers from the plant and will wait further notice from the emergency bureau to reopen.”

China’s biggest river, the Yangtze, and several of its tributaries have risen to dangerous levels after days of heavy rain, forcing tens of thousands of people from their homes and triggering an unprecedented emergency response alert.

Tongwei has a total of 80,000 tonnes of annual polysilicon production capacity, accounting for nearly one fifth of China’s total capacity.

Polysilicon prices have increased more than 60% since mid-July after GCL-Poly Energy owned plant in northwestern region Xinjiang was reported experiencing an output disruption.

China Silicon Industry Association expected the upward trend of polysilicon prices may persist until September due to supply shortages.

In July, China produced out around 28,200 tonnes of polysilicon, down 14.4% from a month ago.

Analysts from Citi in a note last week also warned higher solar module prices, thanks to rising raw material prices, could curtail ultimate installation demand due to reduced return from solar farm investment.

China installed 11.5 gigawatts (GW) new solar capacity in the first half of 2020. A researcher from a think tank affiliated with China’s National Energy Administration expected last month that China’s full year new solar installation to reach 40-43 GW.","Tue, 18 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['polysilicon', 'emergency', 'capacity', 'solar', 'forces', 'silicon', 'china', 'flood', 'cut', 'quarter', 'city', 'material', 'raw', 'prices', 'plant', 'tongwei']",

CHONGQING, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- Floodwater in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality started receding as the water level at the Cuntan hydrologic station fell below the alarm level of 180.5 meters at 8 a.m. Saturday.

The water flow at the station also dropped from the peak of 74,600 cubic meters per second to 36,300 cubic metres per second, according to station sources.

Water of the Yangtze River at Caiyuanba and Chaotianmen hydrologic stations was also flowing below warning levels.

Chongqing saw the biggest flood of this year as the water level at the Cuntan station reached 191.55 meters, 0.14 meters higher than the record in 1981, at around 8 a.m. Thursday. This made the city activate a top-level response to the floods.

The floods caused an emergency evacuation of 251,000 people and inundated 23,700 shops, but did not lead to deaths, according to the city's emergency management bureau.

Disaster relief and production resumption are underway, with gas supply resuming for 15,000 households.

The toes of the 71-metre Buddha statue in Leshan were submerged in water on Tuesday, August 18, the first time that has happened in 70 years, state media reported.

The threat to the statue, built in 713 AD, is just one example of how the vast floods are threatening lives, infrastructure and heritage.

Heavy rains since the weekend have triggered flooding across China’s Sichuan Province, forcing authorities to activate the highest level of a four-tier flood alert system for the first time on record, while parts of the provincial capital Chengdu have been hit by the worst flooding since 1981, authorities said.

The floods have triggered mudslides that have destroyed homes and property and the rising waters have devastated swathes of farmland.

More than 100,000 people had been evacuated as of Tuesday while emergency services have rescued hundreds of people trapped by the flooding, say authorities.

Rescue efforts have not just been limited to the region's human population. Amateur footage captured the moment firefighters rushed to save a number of dogs from a pet hospital in Chengdu on Friday.

More than 63.4 million have been affected by flooding in regions across China this year, according to authorities, with the country being battered by unusually heavy rains since early June.

A total of 219 people have died or remain missing as of August 13.

Torrential downpours of nonstop rain have been wreaking havoc in China’s Sichuan province, which has caused some operations to shut down ASIC mining devices. Reports from the region show that certain areas have seen electrical shortages and the aftermath is causing quite a bit of stress for Chinese bitcoin miners.

Not too long ago, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the rain issues in Asia, as a myriad of countries have been dealing with the crazy 2020 monsoon season. Our newsdesk also reported on the alleged problems with the beleaguered Three Gorges Dam. During the last week, China has seen some of the worst flooding in over 70 years.

Now the prolonged rain has caused flooding and landslides in 17 counties surrounding China’s Sichuan province. Sichuan is dealing with serious flooding because it sits on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.

China is home to a great number of the world’s bitcoin miners (50%) and Sichuan commands the densest region of bitcoin mining facilities in the country.

The rainfall and electrical shortages have been terrible for bitcoin miners causing a number of operations to temporarily halt mining.

The Chinese mining operation, Poolin, which commands the largest percentage of BTC hashrate today, shared videos of similar floods and mudslide devastation last year.

“A local mining farm based in Sichuan, China was devastated by the recent heavy rainfall in the region,” Poolin tweeted sharing a video of the situation in August 2019. The mining pool shared another recording of a Chinese worker trying to salvage bitcoin mining rigs from the mud. “Clip of personnel digging out miners from the mud,” Poolin said during the floods last August.

On Tuesday, Poolin again shared another video clip of a mining farm being ravaged during this year’s nonstop rain in Sichuan.

Local reports this weekend say that the monsoon season this August is much worse than last summer’s flooding in Sichuan.

On Monday, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the BTC hashrate touching 130 exahash per second (EH/s). But now some of the top mining pools in China are seeing 10-15% losses in hashrate.

BTC hashrate is hard to measure and most analytical sites measure the rate every 1-2 days. However, stats from fork.lol measure the BTC hashrate in exahash per second with 12, 6, and even 3-hour averages.

Metrics show that the SHA256 hashrate saw a loss of 15-30 EH/s during the continuous rainstorms in Sichuan. One stat shows the hashrate dropped as low as 101 EH/s during the early morning hours (ET) on Tuesday morning.

Roughly 10 mining pools lost hashrate during the last 24 hours including top Chinese pools such as Antpool, Poolin, F2pool, Huobi, and Viabtc.

The mining pool 58coin&1thash lost a whopping 33% of hashrate during the last 24-hours taking the biggest hit on Tuesday. Stats show the top mining pool in terms of hashrate during the last seven days, Poolin lost over 15% during the overnight. Poolin is still the top mining pool with over 16EH/s and 762,531 workers according to the pool’s hashrate data.

On Saturday, August 15, the Changjiang Water Resources Commission (CWRC) issued dire warnings about major flood levels and reports say water inflow reached 62,000 cubic meters per second.

Some of the worst devastations affected Neijiang City’s Zizhong County, Wenchuan county, Mianyang City’s Santai County, and more than half of Guidezhen is underwater. Over three dozen rivers and tributaries have exceeded flood levels not seen in decades.

Aug. 20 (UPI) -- Fear is growing again in China the Three Gorges Dam could be breached as rivers across the country continue to overflow and rise to record levels.

About 260,000 residents in the southwestern city of Chongqing have been evacuated, and thousands of shops in the city were submerged underwater by Thursday, state-owned Beijing News reported.

The dam, which was built in 2003 and spans the Yangtze River in Hubei province, is expected to receive a record 76,000 cubic meters of water per second as heavy downpours continue in the region, according to the report.

Chinese authorities have said 10 of the dam's floodgates were opened on Wednesday, discharging 48,000 cubic meters of water per second.

Water levels along the Yangtze River near Chongqing, upstream of the dam, reached new levels not seen since 1981, The Guardian reported Thursday.

Hongyadong, a city landmark, was partly submerged underwater. The 11-story wooden building includes popular bars, cafes and restaurants. Shopkeepers on the first and second floors were evacuated, according to Chinese state media. Other store owners were instructed to move their merchandise to higher floors of historical buildings, the South China Morning Post reported.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang arrived in Chongqing on Thursday and visited a village affected by the floods.

President Xi Jinping had visited another region of China, Anhui province, on Tuesday. State media reports 21 rivers in the province have exceeded flood-limit levels.

The Three Gorges Dam, a massive state-led project, was built in 12 years, displacing millions and inundating vast areas of land, according to The Guardian.

Mass flooding in several provinces across China has affected tens of millions of people. Beijing has limited information on the floods, prompting Chinese users of social media to upload images of downpours destroying towns and villages.","Thu, 20 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi_com/9981597939612/2020/1/ddc2b31a7419efa27719d1e1686fcf0c/v1.5/Three-Gorges-Dam-hits-record-levels-as-flooding-continues-in-China.jpg,"['hits', 'chinese', 'continues', 'chongqing', 'levels', 'china', 'according', 'city', 'state', 'flooding', 'province', 'dam', 'record', 'underwater', 'media', 'gorges']",

-- Rain-triggered floods have affected tens of millions in dozens of provincial-level regions in China, and destroyed vast stretches of farmland and agricultural facilities.

-- In the face of the floods, Chinese authorities have been mobilizing resources, using upgraded technology, and providing material support to ensure grain security and make up for losses in production.

-- China's summer grain output has reached a historic high in 2020. The increasing plantation area of autumn grain and the well growing crops have laid a solid foundation for another bumper harvest.

BEIJING, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- Since mid-July, Huang Xiaoping has been busy working in his 110-hectare paddy field, harvesting early rice and sowing for the next season.

Huang also runs a rental business involving farm machinery in a village near the Dongting Lake, China's second-largest freshwater lake in the central Hunan Province, helping local farmers during the ""double rush"" season.

""We need to fight the current flood and strengthen the embankments,"" Huang said.

According to China's Ministry of Emergency Management, rain-triggered floods had affected some 54.8 million people in 27 provincial-level regions as of late July, causing direct economic losses of 144.43 billion yuan (about 20.8 billion U.S. dollars).

Restrictions on food exports and panic hoarding in some countries and regions, as well as rampant desert locust, have adversely affected food production.

""The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2020"" report released by five agencies, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, projected that COVID-19 could push up to 132 million people into starvation globally this year.

Though downpours and floods destroyed vast stretches of farmland and agricultural facilities, flood control situation in the hard-hit provinces of Jiangxi and Anhui is improving as the water level in major waterways continues to recede.

The flood control and drought relief headquarters of the two provinces have successively downgraded their emergency response level since early August.

In the face of the floods, the Chinese provinces have been mobilizing resources, using upgraded technology, and providing material support to ensure grain security and make up for losses in production.

For farmers like Huang, time is the essence. In the low-lying township of Liaonan near the Poyang Lake in Jiangxi, Wu Baolin was busy sowing seeds of late rice with two workers. He saw some two hectares of his crops damaged in the floods.

""The harvest is finally guaranteed even if it might be delayed,"" Wu said, adding that there is no time to lose when it comes to growing crops.

In Anhui, replantation of single-cropping rice has been carried out on every piece of farmland where the floodwater has receded. As of early August, more than 100,000 hectares of crops had been resowed, accounting for 38 percent of Anhui's total area of farmland needing replantation, according to the provincial department of agriculture and rural affairs.

China's total grain output consists of three parts -- early rice, summer grain and autumn production. Summer grain is the first season of the annual grain production, which accounts for more than a fifth of the annual output.

Various measures have been adopted by authorities to ensure stable grain output amid efforts to control the COVID-19 epidemic, such as fully implementing support policies like the minimum purchase price for rice and wheat and improving the quality of spring plowing.

As the world's top food producer and consumer, China saw its grain output reach a record high of 664 million tonnes last year, the 16th bumper year in a row.

The country's summer grain output reached a historic high of 142.81 million tonnes this year, up 0.9 percent from last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

Autumn grain crops, which include corn, middle- and late-season rice and soybean, account for the bulk of China's grain production. The total plantation area of autumn grain has increased steadily this year and the crops are growing fine, thus laying a solid foundation for another bumper harvest.

In order to strengthen the prevention and control of plant diseases and pest, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has called for ramped up efforts against the invasion of fall armyworms, rice planthoppers and rice leaf rollers, the three migratory species of pest that threaten autumn grain production.

Pan Wenbo, a crop management official with the ministry, said despite severe floods in parts of the country, crop farming remains stable overall.

Efforts have been made in grain reserves and circulation, grain purchasing, local grain reserves, and improving the capacity for emergency supply.

The Ministry of Emergency Management and the Ministry of Finance have earmarked 935 million yuan in disaster relief funds to aid local disaster relief work in provinces including Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan and Anhui.

Agricultural authorities have built up a 50,000-tonne seed reserve to cope with disasters and crop failures, with more than 7,000 tonnes of seeds already handled to support crop farming for 320,000 hectares of farmland.

According to the department of agriculture and rural affairs in Hunan, the overall flood situation in the province is relatively stable compared with previous years, and the safety of grain production remains within a controllable range.

Wu Liquan, professor at Anhui Agricultural University, said the flooding is unlikely to cause a sharp decrease in grain production since the reinforced dikes and embankments along the Yangtze River have made farmlands safer. Besides, improved irrigation and drainage facilities coupled with advanced agricultural technologies, have further improved safety.

In Hubei, more than 4,000 sci-tech workers from agricultural research institutions have been providing online and offline technical guidance to local farmers, donating more than 700 tonnes of farming supplies and distributing some 300,000 copies of various technical materials.

""We will continue to listen to the needs of farmers and enterprises, help them solve problems and better serve the recovery of agricultural production,"" said You Aiqing, a rice breeding expert and deputy head of the Hubei Academy of Agricultural Sciences. ■

People-centered efforts ""I have always been concerned about the people in flood-stricken areas,"" Xi said while meeting locals, adding that he felt ease after seeing villagers had a place to live and had restarted production. Severe rainstorms have hit many regions in China this summer, triggering flooding of rivers. According to the Ministry of Emergency Management (MEM), 54.8 million people in 27 provincial-level regions have been affected. Chinese leaders have called for unrelenting efforts to ensure the safety of people's lives and property.

China has made all-out efforts in flood control and disaster relief with massive mobilization, evacuations and a top-level emergency response in several hard-hit provinces. Through the nationwide joint efforts, the MEM said, the number of deaths and missing due to floods fell by 53.9 percent from with the national average of the past five years. The number of evacuated people increased by 36.7 percent, the ministry added.

Li visits heavily damaged homes, fields, assures help on the way

Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday encouraged Chongqing residents to rebuild flood-damaged homes as the city faces one of its worst floods in history.

Li, while visiting Shuangba village in Chongqing, said that President Xi Jinping's significant instructions on flood prevention and post-disaster reconstruction should be fully implemented, and the safety of people's lives and property should be soundly secured.

The entire village of 8,000 residents, alongside the Fujiang River, a branch of the Yangtze River, was hit by flooding and crops were destroyed.

Li visited flooded houses, waterlogged farmlands and shelters for displaced villagers. He said the Party and government will help villagers overcome their difficulties, adding that he believes they can rebuild if everyone works together.

On Monday, floods hit Chongqing for a fifth time this year after recent heavy rainstorms in the Sichuan Basin in the upper reaches of the Yangtze. Its flood control and drought relief headquarters upgraded its response to the highest level on Tuesday afternoon for the first time ever. The flood's peak began passing through the city on Thursday.

Cuntan station on the Yangtze River in Chongqing saw its highest water level in eight decades on Thursday morning, according to the Chongqing Emergency Response Bureau.

Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, learns about local measures for flood control, disaster relief and post-flood production recovery at a ""zhuangtai,"" a residential structure on raised ground with higher elevation that functions as a safe haven from river floods, in Funan County in Fuyang, east China's Anhui Province, Aug. 18, 2020. (Xinhua/Ju Peng)

BEIJING, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- While visiting the flood-stricken residents in Funan County, east China's Anhui Province, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said Tuesday that he has always been concerned about the people in flood-stricken areas.

Xi also checked the water situation of the Huaihe River and learned about local measures for flood control, disaster relief and post-flood production recovery during his inspection tour in the province.

As China experienced a particularly tough test in flood control this summer, coupled with small, scattered outbreaks of the COVID-19 epidemic, the authorities have pooled resources to concentrate efforts to safeguard people's lives and property.

Since the start of the flood season, China has allocated central budgetary funds for disaster relief totaling 1.155 billion yuan (about 167 million U.S. dollars) for regions hit by floods as of July 13.

To ensure ample manpower in the fight against the floods, the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police Force joined in the flood control work, dispatching troops to 3,749 operations of flood relief and helping evacuate 137,000 residents affected by the floods as of July 28.

The key behind the country's strong actions to control the floods is its people-centered governing philosophy. In a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on July 17, Xi stressed putting people's lives and property first and taking more forceful measures to do a good job in flood control and relief work.

To help flood-hit regions overcome difficulties, the country has established a mechanism that allows local authorities to apply for a part of budgetary disaster relief funds before the tallying of disaster losses is completed, making relief operations more timely and efficient.

""This can effectively reduce the number of people who die or disappear in disasters, and save people's lives and properties to a much better extent,"" said Yang Xiaodong, an official with the Ministry of Emergency Management.

Regarding flood victims in post-flood recovery, local authorities were required to enhance support for them in terms of epidemic control, life assistance, production, hygiene and compensation to restore production and life orders. Workshops and recruitment campaigns were launched by local governments to ensure those who have shaken off poverty will not fall back to poverty due to the floods.

China's governing capability combined with its people-oriented approach has acted as a double-layer shield with a great degree of strength and resilience against the threats of floods and disasters.

Statistics show that the number of people dead or missing due to the floods since July was 82 percent lower than the average for the same period of the past five years, while collapsed houses and direct economic losses dropped 78.3 percent and 5.9 percent, respectively.

During his inspection tour in Anhui, Xi stressed that the country must improve its capability to prevent and combat disasters in its effort to build a modern socialist country in an all-round way. As enhancing capacity on disaster prevention is expected to be included in more of the country's policies such as the 14th Five-Year Plan, the shield can only become stronger. ■","Thu, 20 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",,"['peoples', 'chinas', 'xinhua', 'central', 'approach', 'flood', 'control', 'commentary', 'relief', 'disaster', 'local', 'disasters', 'province', 'floods', 'shield', 'xi', 'peoplecentered']",

Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged his country to take immediate actions to curb what he called its “shocking and distressing” food waste problem as the worst flooding along the Yangtze River in years threatens the country’s important rice crop.

In an instruction released last week, Xi urged the country to pay attention to the risks of food security, and highlighted the challenge the country faces as the coronavirus pandemic spurs concerns over tightening food supplies and surging prices.

Analysts who spoke to VOA say recent pressure on China’s food security is due to natural disasters at home and worsening relations with many of Beijing’s trade partners.

China’s food waste

A 2018 report by the China Academy of Science found China wasted up to 18 million tons of food served in four big cities in 2015 alone, enough to feed 30 to 50 million people annually.

The report said Chinese cities produce 25% of the world’s municipal solid waste, most of it food. Patrons of the country’s catering industry each wasted an average of 11.7 percent of their meal.

According to a 2015 estimate from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), China wastes up to 35 million tons of food per year. That’s nearly 6% of the country’s annual food production.

The FAO estimates that about one-third of all food produced gets lost or is wasted during production, transportation and consumption. However the situation is different in each country.

Who’s wasting food in China?

In Chinese society, people usually treat others to meals in order to make new friends or enhance established relationships, and serving expensive and rare food is considered a form of respect for guests. According to a 2015 study , a formal dinner typically includes four to six cold dishes and eight to 10 hot dishes, served with soup and fruits.

Zhong Dajun, director of the Beijing Dajun Institute for Economic Observation, told VOA that the wasting of food has been increasing over the years as people gained more disposable income.

“I think compared to the general public, officials dining with public funds account for only a small proportion,” he said. “With strong spending power, Chinese people have to pay attention to frugality and saving food.”

Preparing or ordering more food than necessary has long been regarded as a symbol of hospitality in China. Zhu Qizhen, a professor at China Agricultural University, told the South China Morning Post that because of this tradition, “the amount of leftovers has become the standard for a sumptuous feast.”

Yet political commentator Heng Hei said one of the main problems with the country’s food waste problem is linked to the lavish excesses of the Chinese Communist Party.

“This level of food wasting has to do with CCP’s extravagant culture. Ordinary Chinese people don’t waste to that level,” he said.

In a survey by China’s state newspaper Beijing Youth Daily in 2013, a shocking 97.8% of respondents felt that Chinese officials were wasting public funds. Of those funds, 33.8% were used for official receptions , including extravagant dining.

President Xi subsequently launched an anti-corruption campaign as a means to curb extreme levels of corruption. Yet analysts point out this is also an effective way to get rid of his political enemies. China also launched the “Clean Your Plate Campaign” in 2013, which aimed to “put an end to officials’ extravagant feasts and receptions, according to state media Global Times.

Food security

China’s leader Xi has long tied the country’s food security to national security. In a visit to the country’s largest soybean producer — Heilongjiang province — in 2018, Xi said ""the rice bowl of the Chinese people, in any situation, must be firmly held in our own hands.""

Yet 2020 has delivered a one-two punch to the world’s second largest economy.

The country is experiencing the worst flooding in more than two decades, destroying thousands of acres of farmland along the Yangtze River. With the nickname “Land of Rice and Fish,” the broader Yangtze River basin accounts for 70% of China’s rice production.

Given how much cropland was damaged by mid-July, Chinese brokerage firm Shenwan Hongyuan estimated that China could lose 5% of its rice production compared to last year.

Photo Credit: China Daily via Reuters / TPG Images A worker wearing a face mask works on a production line manufacturing soybean-based food products at a factory in Hefei, Anhui province, China, February 4, 2020.

China’s National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration issued an announcement on August 5, pointing out the country’s wheat harvest has fallen by nearly 1000 tons compared to 2019 levels.

According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, food prices in China climbed about 10% in July compared to a year ago, with the price of corn 20% higher compared to the same period last year. The prices for soybeans jumped by 30% compared to the end of last year.

Beijing has responded to the crisis by stabilizing supply from its strategic reserve. According to China Grain Reserves Group, Beijing has released 62.5 million tons of rice, 50 million tons of corn and over 760,000 tons of soybeans by the end of July, a level nearly double the volume released during the whole of 2019.

Meanwhile, China’s worsening relations with some of its major trade partners could create uncertainty for China’s food supply chain. For example, the country has been relying on imports from the U.S. to try to stabilize prices as well as fulfill its commitment to purchase U.S. agricultural products.

In the first six months of this year, China imported nearly 61 million tons of grain, a 21% jump from a year ago. Imports of corn, soybeans, and wheat have also increased, according to data from Chinese customs.

Analysts caution that an overdependence on food imports could hurt Beijing’s strategic interest. Meanwhile, the continuing political tensions with Western countries could lead to trade barriers such as higher taxes, raising prices and further threatening the country’s food security.

Economist Zhong Dajun said China has to import as least 100 million tons of crop every year, and “it will be pretty troublesome for Beijing to increase the production by that amount domestically.”

Around 8am yesterday, the water level at the Cuntan hydrologic station in Chongqing reached 191.55m - 14cm higher than the record in 1981 - and was still rising.

Chongqing, located in the upper reaches of China's biggest river, upgraded its flood-control response to Level I on Tuesday, the highest rung in the country's four-tier emergency response system for floods.

At least 250,000 Chongqing residents have been relocated to safe places.

According to the Chongqing Emergency Response Bureau, the water level at Cuntan was higher than the devastating flood which left 1.5 million people homeless in 1981.

More than 8,660 sq km of arable land was flooded.

The direct economic loss caused by the floods was about two billion yuan.

Since Monday, Chongqing, which is located in the upper Yangtze watershed, has been hit by heavy flooding for the fifth time this year due to heavy downpours in the upper Yangtze region.

Meanwhile, in Hubei province - Chongqing's eastern neighbour-the authorities warned that the Three Gorges reservoir in the province would see the most severe round of floods since it started to hold water in 2003.

According to a forecast by the Changjiang Water Resources Commission of the Ministry of Water Resources, the inbound flow of water is expected to reach more than 74,000 cubic m per second after continuous heavy rain battered the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.

The river flows for 6,300km from glaciers in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau through Chongqing, and then to Wuhan in Hubei province and Nanjing in Jiangsu province, before reaching the East China Sea at Shanghai.

The Three Gorges project is a multi-functional water-control system consisting of a 2,309m-long and 185m-high dam, a five-tier ship lock on the north and south, and 34 turbo-generators with a combined generating capacity of 22.5 million kilowatts.

The Chinese government has earmarked 460 million yuan (S$91 million) for flood relief in the Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Chongqing regions, the Ministry of Emergency Management said on Wednesday.

A tropical depression in the north-east of the South China Sea intensified into a typhoon at around 8am on Tuesday (Aug 18), according to the meteorological department of Hainan Province.

The typhoon will land in coastal areas on Wednesday, including locations in the western part of Guangdong and those in the north-eastern part of Hainan.

Provinces of Hainan, Guangdong, Yunnan and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will have torrential rain starting from Wednesday, the meteorological department said.

The emergency management department of Hainan has issued a typhoon alert, warning that fishing boats and other vessels should return to harbours.

Meteorologists also alerted the affected areas to take preventive measures and guard against secondary disasters. Tourists have been advised not to go out when heavy rain and gales hit the areas.

Meanwhile, China's biggest river, the Yangtze, and several of its tributaries have risen to dangerous levels after days of heavy rain, forcing tens of thousands of people from their homes and triggering an unprecedented emergency response alert.

China has seen unusually high levels of rain this flood season, with the south-west and central regions in the Yangtze River basin bearing the brunt of flooding.

The Ministry of Water Resources said on Monday that 38 tributaries on the upper reaches of the Yangtze were now higher than their warning levels, 19 dangerously so.

The south-western province of Sichuan, which includes a major upstream section of the Yangtze, has raised its flood emergency response to its highest level, the first time it has ever done so, with its rivers overflowing and villages and farmland inundated.

The Qingyi river, an upper Yangtze tributary, had seen its worst flooding in a century, Sichuan's flood control authority said, with the city of Ya'an forced to evacuate more than 36,000 people as the river burst its banks on Monday.

The Yangtze and Huai river basins have seen the highest level of rainfall since records began in 1961, officials have said. As many as 634 rivers throughout the country have exceeded their official flood warning levels.

He also visited Hefei, capital of Anhui, where he learned about the condition of Chaohu Lake, praised military forces dedicated to flood relief work, learned about the province's scientific innovation work and paid tribute to revolutionary martyrs.

While talking with flood-affected villagers on Tuesday, Xi said that Chinese people have been battling natural disasters for thousands of years and have accumulated valuable experience.

""During the fight, we should respect nature, conform to the laws of nature and live in harmony with nature,"" he said.

Xi said that he felt relieved when he saw people's lives and work were protected and they were hopeful.

""I have always been concerned about the people in flood-stricken areas,"" he said.

Local residents told Xi that they have access to stable power and water supplies, and have daily necessities delivered to them. They also said that as the floodwaters receded, they resumed farm work.

Anhui is among many places in the country ravaged by floods and landslides caused by incessantly heavy rains this summer. As of Aug 13, more than 63 million people nationwide had been affected, according to the Ministry of Emergency Management.

During a meeting on July 17, Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, stressed putting people's lives and property first and taking more forceful measures to improve flood control and relief work.

The inspection tour is the latest among the president's busy agenda of domestic tours this year.

There are more than 20 flood diversion areas along the Huaihe River and most of them are in Anhui, according to the provincial government.

In Funan, which was previously a key county for the country's poverty alleviation campaign, many villagers have migrated to cities for work. The local government has made great efforts to create jobs for those who have remained so that they will not have to rely on the limited income they can make from crops.

Wang Hengliang, a villager from Wangjiaba township who briefed Xi on Tuesday about his factory, said he was excited about the president's visit and has the confidence to run his business better.

Wang, who went to Shanghai as a migrant worker in 2000, returned to his hometown to create a business making bags and suitcases after the government put forward favorable policies to support entrepreneurship in 2015. Wang said the president showed concern for the business and asked him questions about its development.

Of his firm's 97 employees, 48 are from poverty-stricken families, and each employee on average earns more than 2,000 yuan ($289) a month, Wang said.

Floods on the upper reaches of China's Yangtze river, which passes through Sichuan, forced authorities to evacuate more than 100,000 people on Tuesday and threatened a world heritage site, the Leshan Giant Buddha.

In the same city, Shenghe subsidiary Leshan Shenghe and Sichuan Runhe Catalytic New Material Co, in which it holds a 38.1% stake, were hit by flooding, Shenghe said in a Wednesday filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

Leshan's Wutongqiao district ""suffered a once-in-a-century severe flood on Aug. 18,"" the statement said.

""The water level ... is quite deep. At the moment the factories have completely stopped production and all personnel have been evacuated safely.""

China is the world's dominant producer of rare earths, a group of 17 minerals prized for their use in consumer electronics and military equipment.

Leshan Shenghe, which processes rare earth ore into material useable by manufacturers, is expected to lose 240 million-330 million yuan ($35 million-$48 million) due to the flooding, including 220 million-280 million yuan in inventory, the filing said.

That far exceeds the 83.8 million yuan Shenghe said in a separate filing that the unit's inventory was insured up to. Leshan Shenghe produced more than 28,000 tonnes of rare earth salts in 2019.

Runhe Catalytic New Material Co is expected to lose 150 million-190 million yuan, including 120 million-130 million yuan in inventory, and has no insurance, the filings said.

Shenghe, which also has a minority stake in U.S. rare earths miner MP Materials, said the plants would work to resume production under local government guidance, without giving a time frame.

Asharq Al-Awsat

Firefighters in lifejackets waded through chest-high water to rescue around 20 dogs trapped at a pet hospital in southwest China's Sichuan province as heavy rain and flooding doused the region.

Hospital employees and their canine wards were trapped in the clinic in Chengdu city Sunday after water rose up to the building's second floor, state broadcaster CCTV reported.

But rescuers lifted the dogs onto bright orange rafts to ferry them across the muddy water -- with one small mutt making the journey in a green recycling bin.

All humans and animals trapped in the hospital were eventually taken to safety after six hours of work, rescuers said.

Summer flooding has been an annual scourge since ancient times, typically focused in the vast and heavily populated Yangtze basin that drains central China.

Rising waters across central and eastern China this year have left over 210 people dead or missing, and floods have destroyed 54,000 homes, according to China's Ministry of Emergency Management.

Video broadcast by Chinese state-run media in July showed cities and towns inundated by water that rose in some places to the roofs of single-story homes, as rescue personnel evacuated men, women and children aboard inflatable boats.

Sichuan on Monday raised its flood alert to the second-highest level after continuous heavy rain since Saturday damaged farmland and transport infrastructure, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.","Mon, 17 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://english.aawsat.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2020/08/17/firefighters_in_lifejackets_waded_through_chest-high_water_to_rescue_around_dogs_trapped_at_a_pet_hospital_in_chinas_sichuan_province._afp.jpg?itok=yZBqd9VX,"['caught', 'trapped', 'mutts', 'sichuan', 'dogs', 'firefighters', 'let', 'flood', 'china', 'water', 'rose', 'waded', 'rescuers', 'rescue', 'hospital', 'chinas']",

The vast reservoir held in place by the Three Gorges Dam has reached a historic high, as flood waters destroyed houses, overran neighbourhoods and threatened ancient landmarks across the southern reaches of China.

The volume of water entering the reservoir controlled by the Three Gorges Dam – the world’s largest – reached a record 75,000 cubic metres per second at 8 a.m. Thursday, Chinese authorities reported, a quantity of water more than five times the discharge of the St. Lawrence Seaway. At one hydrological station in the megacity of Chongqing, water levels on the Yangtze River exceeded those from 1981, the year of a devastating flood that killed more than 2,000. State media sought to calm fears that the flood could threaten the Three Gorges Dam, after critics raised concern about the potential for structural problems in the deluge.

It was the fifth flood crest in a summer during which weeks of heavy rain have brought a particularly difficult test for Chinese emergency authorities, who have grappled with a pandemic alongside a continuing natural disaster – one whose lengthy path of destruction has included Wuhan itself, the city at the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak.

For weeks, authorities have plucked stranded farmers from rooftops and moved urban shopkeepers out of harm’s way as waters roar down a river basin that sustains some 40 per cent of the country’s economy.

Flooding this week has threatened the Leshan Giant Buddha, a 71-metre-high eighth-century marvel; it has set off flood warnings on 51 different rivers and prompted Chinese President Xi Jinping to undertake an inspection tour in Anhui province, where he met families of people who died and commended the “heroes” who have responded, plucking people such as Dong Lirong out of harm’s way.

Ms. Dong runs a farmhouse inn and restaurant on Fengzhou Island, just two kilometres from the Giant Buddha, and spent much of Tuesday waiting for rescue after waking up at 4 a.m. to find the waters lapping at her bed. She woke her family and they heaved open their door against the passing torrent, before climbing a ladder to the roof. As they waited, the island was submerged and their lives began to disappear. More than 1,000 people were trapped.

“Imagine how it felt, squatting on a narrow platform and watching all of your belongings and household appliances floating away: the TV, the bed, the closet, the refrigerator, the freezer we used to store vegetables and meat,” she said.

So fierce was the rush of passing water that even when rescue boats showed up, they struggled to approach the family. When her husband returned to survey the damage the following day, he found only bits of the concrete structure left. “He convinced me not to go back. ‘You will feel pain,’” he told her.

Ms. Dong brought nothing with her besides the clothes on her back.

“It feels like our family’s hopes are gone with the water,” she said.

The Yangtze River area has been historically prone to floods, a basin whose enormity – it is bigger than Quebec – has defied the heavy-spending efforts of the Chinese government to tame natural forces, particularly as climate change increases the risk of extreme weather events.

Open this photo in gallery In this aerial photo released by China's Xinhua News Agency, flooding is seen in Bikou township of Longnan city, in northwestern China's Gansu Province, on Aug. 18, 2020. Du Zheyu/Xinhua via AP

The Three Gorges Dam, completed in 2006, was designed in part to provide some human control over the river system, while decades of investment have helped to increase forest cover and restore thousands of square kilometres of flood plains. At the same time, industrial development and the expansion of farmland have destroyed thousands of square kilometres of wetlands, while greater erosion from nearby slopes has added silt to existing flood-plain areas, reducing their effectiveness in storing excess water.

But if the waters have proven difficult to tame, Chinese leaders have grown more skilled at reducing the human cost. Though 63 million people had been affected by flooding as of last week, the death toll has remained far lower than in previous floods – a testament in part to the effectiveness of the country’s armed forces, who have been deployed in great numbers to conduct evacuations. As of last week, Chinese authorities said 219 people have died in the floods.

The economic toll is likely to be far greater, although increased sophistication in flood management has also allowed authorities to pare some of that cost.

In Chongqing’s Ciqikou Ancient Town, for example, authorities told Du Jian to leave before water inundated his two shops selling handmade glutinous rice cake. It was enough advance warning to remove valuable items out of harm’s way.

Still, the high waters this year come at a particularly difficult time. Mr. Du estimates that the pandemic has already caused him more than $150,000 in losses.

“The wounds of COVID-19 have yet to heal and now we are faced with this flood,” he said. Water has inundated about 80 per cent of the stores in Ciqikou, Mr. Du said. Flood waters reached into third-floor spaces.

Yet landlords still demand hefty rent payments.

“I can already imagine how much we will lose from this,” he said.

China's Hekou Yao County announced recently that the Madushan Dam would open its floodgates from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Thursday as heavy rains had caused the dam to reach its maximum capacity, Vu Van Cai, director of the Department of Foreign Affairs of Lao Cai Province, said Thursday morning. He cited a communication to this effect from the Hekou Yao Department of Foreign Affairs.

The amount of water discharged has not been confirmed by Chinese authorities, Cai said.

""They did not provide a specific number, only saying that water levels in the Red River would be higher than what it was on August 18. This morning (Thursday), the water level in Lao Cai Town was 80.2 m,"" he added.

As of Thursday afternoon, a Chinese station about 80 km from the Vietnamese border observed the water level slowly rising, according to Vietnam’s National Center for Hydrometeorological Forecasting.

However, considering the dam's capacity to hold around 550 million m3 of water, the impact of the water discharge would not be too significant, said Tran Quang Hoai, deputy head of the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention.

Nevertheless, provincial authorities have requested districts and communes located along the river, including Lao Cai Town and the districts of Bao Thang and Bao Yen to stop fishing activities and waterway traffic, and to deploy flood prevention measures.

Other northern Vietnam localities, including the provinces of Yen Bai, Phu Tho and Vinh Phuc as well as the capital city of Hanoi should also closely monitor the situation to prevent flooding and landslides, evacuating vulnerable people if necessary, the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention said Thursday.

The Madushan Dam, in China's Yunnan Province, has a capacity of 300 MW and is about 350 km from Vietnam's border.

The Red River, over 1,100 km long, originates in China and runs through Lao Cai, Yen Bai, Phu Tho, Vinh Phuc and Hanoi. The river section that flows through Vietnam is about 510 km long.

Floods and landslides triggered by torrential rains in northern Vietnam have killed seven people and injured another four since August 17. The houses of around 1,000 families have been damaged and many households have been evacuated to safer ground.

Natural disasters, including drought, floods and landslides, killed 133 Vietnamese citizens last year and caused losses of around VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

Following their home flooding, the woman from Yudong, Chongqing, China, broke a window to retrieve her husband’s beloved toys.

Apparently the husband didn’t save the figures himself because he doesn’t know how to swim, so his wife took one for the team to get them for him. Relationship goals or what?

The figures that were saved were figures from Gundam, a Japanese military science fiction mixed media franchise.

The husband shared the video explaining that his wife saved the toys and, referring to his wife, said ‘I will never let you down in this life’ – at least I think he was referring to his wife and not the Gundam figures…

According to the water level warning line issued by the community, they thought it would not flood the second floor, but the water level rose. He can’t swim. His wife swims across the Yangtze River and assessed that the risk of stagnant water is not high and she has a life jacket, so she decided to save Gundam.

In the husband’s defence, most of the figures are around £20-£30 each on Amazon, and from the looks from the amount that he has, that’s a lot of money he’s spent.

The event marked the first time in at least seven decades that rising water has threatened the statue’s platform.

The Leshan Giant Buddha, an important Buddhist pilgrimage destination that is part of a Unesco World Heritage Site, towers over the water near the confluence of the Minjiang, Qingyi and Dadu Rivers. As water levels rose, officials closed the site to tourists. In an effort to protect the statue, police and staff surrounded it with sandbags—but the water still managed to cover the platform.

This year, the region has seen its worst floods in decades, impacting at least 55 million people. In July, reported Nectar Gan for CNN, the storms displaced more than two million, leaving an additional 141 dead or missing.

“This year’s flooding has unfolded not as a single natural disaster, with an enormous loss of life and property,” writes Steven Lee Meyers for the New York Times, “but rather as a slow, merciless series of smaller ones, whose combined toll has steadily mounted even as official reports have focused on the government’s relief efforts.”

In the Sichuan province, where the Leshan Buddha is located, officials called for the highest level of flood control response for the first time in history, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. In the Yangtze River basin, which accounts for 70 percent of the country’s rice production, flooding damaged people’s homes, farms and food supplies, reports Rob Picheta for CNN.

The Leshan statue—considered to be the largest stone Buddha in the world—is by far the tallest surviving pre-modern statue. Measuring a towering 233 feet, the colossal artwork depicts Maitreya, a bodhisattva and disciple of Siddhārtha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism. If Maitreya were to stand upright, the Buddha would be nearly eye-to-eye with the Statue of Liberty, writes Bryan Hill for Ancient Origins. The head is 48 feet tall and 33 feet wide; its ears can hold two people inside, and 100 monks are said to be able to sit on one foot simultaneously.

The site is a destination for Buddhist pilgrims. By tradition, Maitreya is considered the “future Buddha,” who will one day descend to Earth to preach new dharma, or law. Worship of the deity was popular between the fourth and seventh centuries.

According to legend, a monk named Hai Tong, who lived during the Tang Dynasty, hoped to build the Leshan statue to appease the river gods and save the lives of people who succumbed to its turbulent waters. For two decades, the monk begged for the funds to begin construction. By the time it was completed (90 years later, in 803 A.D., and several decades after Hai Tong’s death), enough stone was removed from the cliff and deposited into the river that the currents were quelled, ""making the waters safe for passing ships,"" according to Ancient Origins.

Besides the ears, which are made of wood and covered with clay, the statue is carved entirely from the stone face of Mount Emei. Numerous temples and thousands of statues, many dating back to the Tang dynasty, dot the mountainside surrounding the Buddha.

The statue was originally protected by a 13-story wooden pavilion, but the structure was destroyed at the end of the Ming Dynasty. To prevent erosion, the sculpture’s creators constructed a drainage system that drew water away from it. This complex system of hidden gutters and channels keeps the inner parts dry.

Despite precautionary efforts to ensure its preservation, pollution and overtourism threaten the statue, with hundreds of thousands visiting the area annually. In 2001, the Chinese government spent more than $33 million on restoration efforts, according to Reuters. But without a decrease in corrosive rainwater and air pollution, the statue may continue to erode.

The 233-foot Leshan Buddha remains a highlight of any visit to the region. Says one avid traveler: It’s so big, it’ s not easy to see. They add, “Make sure you look at Buddha in four ways: from the top, from sides, from the bottom and from the distance taking an about 15 minutes boat ride.”","Mon, 24 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/gaL8jo510sDsJwJbVUjRGJJMX9o=/fit-in/1600x0/filters:focal(1557x871:1558x872)/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/80/a0/80a01aee-5173-4481-a7e3-c23b2038e18d/gettyimages-1228102358.jpg,"['stone', 'decades', 'statue', 'largest', 'site', 'endangers', 'sichuan', 'leshan', 'water', 'worlds', 'flooding', 'province', 'buddha', 'river']",

Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks during an inspection tour in east China's Anhui Province from Tuesday to Friday.

Efforts should be made to implement the decisions and plans of the CPC Central Committee, implement the new development philosophy and follow the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability, Xi said.

The country should uphold reform and opening up as well as high-quality development, deepen supply-side structural reform, and fight the ""three tough battles"" against major risks, poverty and pollution, he said.

Xi called for efforts to ensure stability on six fronts and security in six areas, secure a victory in completing building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and win the battle against poverty.

Efforts should also be made to achieve greater success in the establishment of a new development pattern that takes the domestic market as the mainstay and allows the domestic and foreign markets to boost each other, and make further progress in accelerating the building of a better Anhui, Xi said.

Braving the scorching heat typical of August in the regions between the Yangtze and Huaihe rivers, Xi visited the cities of Fuyang, Ma'anshan and Hefei from Tuesday to Friday.

The tour brought Xi to sites at the front line of flood control, rural areas, enterprises and a revolutionary memorial hall, where he visited and consoled flood-hit residents and personnel fighting floods.

Xi inspected work on advancing economic and social development while keeping regular COVID-19 containment measures in place, stepping up flood control and post-disaster recovery and reconstruction, promoting the integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta, and preparing for the country's development during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025).

On Tuesday afternoon, he visited the Wangjiaba floodgate in Funan County of Fuyang City, where he was briefed about work on the flood control in Anhui and on the floodwater diversion through the Wangjiaba floodgate on July 20, the first such diversion via the floodgate after an interval of 13 years. At an exhibition hall on flood control, Xi learnt about in detail the Huaihe River management history and the flood control work in the river valley.

Xi then went to a luggage and bag company nearby to learn about Funan County's work on shaking off poverty through employment and preventing people from falling back into poverty due to floods. He had a warm conversation with workers there.

Xi expressed his hope that companies in flood-hit zones will overcome difficulties to recover losses to floods. He required local Party committees and governments at all levels to deliver greater support to flood-affected companies and help them through hard times to ensure employment for flood-hit and impoverished people.

Xi later went to Limin Village in Caoji Town and visited a ""zhuangtai,"" a residential structure on raised ground with higher elevation that functions as a safe haven from river floods.



Walking into the fields, Xi learned about post-flood production recovery from the working villagers and stressed that it is necessary to adjust measures to local conditions, step up planting, minimize disaster losses, and strive for a good harvest in autumn.

Xi also visited the villagers' homes to learn about their family income, flood-incurred damage, and the resumption of production.

""I am very concerned about the flood-affected people and came specially to visit our fellow villagers this time. I am relieved to see your life gradually returning to normal with the help of the Party committee and the government and your own efforts to actively engage in production,"" Xi told villagers.

Xi went to Ma'anshan City on Wednesday morning and inspected the comprehensive renovation of waterfronts, ecological and environmental protection and restoration, and the implementation of the 10-year fishing moratorium in the Yangtze River.

He stressed that only by protecting the ecology well and giving full play to the ecological advantages can high-quality development be realized.

Xi also urged promoting well-coordinated environmental conservation and avoiding excessive development in the Yangtze River Economic Belt.

In Ma'anshan, a city built and thrived by steel, Xi visited Magang Group, a subsidiary of China Baowu Steel Group, to learn about the situation of business operation.

Inspecting the workshops and greeting the representatives of the workers, Xi encouraged the company to seize the opportunities brought by the country's further reform of state-owned enterprises and the integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta to enhance market competitiveness.

On Wednesday afternoon, Xi went to the county of Feidong in the provincial capital of Hefei, where he inspected a dam in a wetland-turned flood storage area near the Chaohu Lake.

Since the flood season started this year, the lake has seen its highest water levels ever recorded.

Xi stressed efforts to restore wetlands' functions of flood water storage and ecological conservation. He also called on the southern part of China to continue its flood control and disaster relief efforts, while reminding the northern part of China to guard against possible floods to protect people's lives and property.

On the dam, Xi met people fighting the floods at the front line and consoled families of those who died in the line of duty. Xi sent his regards to all those battling floods across the country.

Xi lauded all the frontline officials, members of the public and military personnel from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the People's Armed Police Force for their will, courage and solidarity.

""Our Party and the people thank you!"" Xi said.

On Wednesday afternoon, Xi also visited the Anhui Innovation Center in Hefei, where he commended the progress the province has made in advancing technological innovation and developing emerging industries of strategic importance.

Visiting a memorial hall marking the PLA's campaign to cross the Yangtze River during the Chinese People's War of Liberation, Xi stressed efforts to always stay true to the Party's original aspiration and founding mission and always be a loyal servant of the people.

On Friday morning, Xi heard work reports from the Anhui provincial Party committee and the provincial government. He affirmed the accomplishments made by Anhui and encouraged the officials and people of the province to achieve more.

Xi stressed work on flood control, disaster relief, and post-disaster reconstruction, as well as support for disaster-stricken enterprises on production and work resumption.

Priority should be given to assisting poor residents affected by the epidemic and floods, so that they will not fall back into poverty because of the disasters.

Xi pledged to arrange several major projects in coordination with the country's 14th Five-Year Plan that are fundamental and pivotal to the security of rivers and lakes, the ecological environment, and urban flood control.

He also underlined the need to deepen agricultural supply-side structural reform to improve the quality, efficiency, and competitiveness of the sector.

Xi stressed strengthening and improving the real economy and transforming and upgrading traditional industries, while developing emerging industries of strategic importance.

He pledged efforts to accelerate the development of the manufacturing industry into a more digitized, intelligent, and internet-powered one, making the industrial and supply chains more stable and modern.

Efforts should also be made to develop core technologies, Xi said, adding that the breakthrough and leading role of the reforms must be given full play.

Stressing the importance of integration and high-quality development, Xi called for further deepening the integration of key areas, and promoting the integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta.

Xi underlined sticking to a people-centered development philosophy, and rolling out more supportive measures on aiding enterprises, cutting their burdens, stabilizing jobs, and expanding employment.

Efforts should be made to ensure jobs for key groups, including college graduates, migrant workers, veterans, and those affected by disasters, Xi said, urging the effective implementation of policies benefiting enterprises to protect and stimulate the vitality of market entities.

China should continuously advance the alignment of poverty elimination and rural vitalization to promote the all-round vitalization of poor regions, Xi said.

The people are the foundation of the Party's governance, Xi said, noting that the fight against COVID-19 and floods have once again proved that, as long as the Party governs for the people and relying on the people, it will be ever-victorious.

Xi stressed making vigorous efforts to guard against formalism, and ensuring that no place will be out of bounds, no stone left unturned, and no tolerance shown in the fight against corruption.","Sat, 22 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",,"['yangtze', 'efforts', 'inspection', 'flood', 'stresses', 'reform', 'development', 'stressed', 'visited', 'work', 'river', 'anhui', 'floods', 'xi', 'quality', 'opening', 'chinaorgcn']",

Echoes of Mao Zedong: Xi Jinping launches campaign against food waste. Producers: The authorities falsify the data to reassure the population. With rising prices and the loss of purchasing power, the outlook for households remains uncertain.

Beijing (AsiaNews) – Chinese farmers have lost up to half of their grain harvest due to the combined effect of droughts, floods and Covid-19, according to an investigation by the South China Morning Post, published today.

The drop in cereal production risks upsetting the food supply chain: rice, wheat and corn are essential components in the national diet. The losses also endanger government plans to achieve self-sufficiency in food production, which they have pursued in the face of the trade war with the United States and the obstacles to international trade caused by the coronavirus.

The issue of food security has prompted President Xi Jinping to order the population not to waste food. His message, launched last week, is part of a national campaign. For their part restaurants are serving smaller portions to customers while catering and food delivery companies propose programs to change Chinese eating habits.

In the interim, the leadership is considering measures to punish food waste. For many observers, Xi's instruction is reminiscent of that issued by Mao Zedong in 1959, at the beginning of the ""Great Famine"", when the Communist leader asked people to ""eat less in their leisure time"".

Drought in May and early June, and heavy rains in July and August, damaged grain production. At the same time, the coronavirus pandemic has created problems in food supply in several areas of the country. To aggravate the situation, farmers are stockpiling the harvest because they expect a further hike in prices.

Official data are contradictory. The authorities speak of an increase in agricultural production of 0.9% compared to the same period last year (of 0.6% that of grains). The growers claim that public officials falsify the data to reassure the population. In confirmation of their objections, the government has so far purchased 42.9 million tons of wheat for strategic reserves from domestic producers: last year, at this time, it had bought 9.4 million more.

Figures on imports also belie the official line. Between January and July, the country imported 74.5 million tons of grains, an increase of nearly 23% on an annual basis. The increase is due to government efforts to comply with the trade pre-agreement with the US, but also to compensate for the fall in domestic supply and the related increase in prices.

The weather emergency threatens to slow the post-pandemic economic recovery. Although official statistics indicate GDP growth of 3.2% in the second quarter of the year, after the fall of 6.8% recorded between January and March, unemployment in the country remains high (5.7%).

The loss of households' purchasing power, however, is far more serious. In the first six months of 2020, the per capita income of the Chinese fell by 1.3%, and per capita expenditure by 9.3%. With food prices on the rise, including those for pork, the outlook for much of the population remains bleak.","Mon, 17 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/CINA_-_0817_-_fame.jpg,"['chinese', 'population', 'million', 'drought', 'production', 'waste', 'security', 'data', 'agricultural', 'food', 'increase', 'covid19', 'floods', 'supply', 'trade', 'risk', 'remains']",

After a night of heavy rainfall, roads, tunnels, intersections, parking garages and communities have been submerged in up to half a meter of water.

Kunming flooding is an annual occurrence since times immemorial — or at least since the Han dynasty. In 2013, the Kunming city government has conducted extensive research into best and worst sewer practices, but the systems in place in Yunnan province today are not equipped to cope with the new extremes — be it extreme drought or extreme rainfall.

Here you can find up to date info on which roads, tunnels and intersections that are experiencing disrupted traffic due to the floods.

Motor vehicles are advised to not attempt to cross flooded sections and follow instructions of traffic police. Likewise, non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians are advised to be careful when crossing flooded road section, to avoid slipping or falling. Expect long queues and waiting times for Didi.

The Kunming fire brigade was despatched 24 times to fight floods and for rescue operations. 25 trucks, 24 boats and 175 firefighters have been deployed. So far 73 people who found themselves trapped or in otherwise precarious circumstances have been rescued and evacuated (video in article).

China has a four-tier, color-coded disaster warning system, with red representing the most severe, followed by orange, yellow and blue.

China's national observatory on Monday continued to issue an orange alert for rainstorms in several provinces and regions.

From 2 pm on Monday to 2 pm on Tuesday, torrential rain and rainstorms were expected to lash parts of the Sichuan Basin. Certain western areas of the basin would experience downpours, the National Meteorological Center said.

It advised local authorities to stay vigilant for possible flooding, landslides and mudslides and suggested halting outdoor activities in disaster-prone areas.

Sichuan's flood control and drought relief headquarters on Monday upgraded its flood-control response to Level II, the second highest in the four-tier emergency response system for floods, from Level III initiated on Saturday.

The upgrading came in the aftermath of excessive rainfall that swelled rivers. The water level of 32 rivers in the province exceeded their warning lines on midday on Monday.

Heavy rain also wrought havoc in the Sichuan capital of Chengdu, resulting in the evacuation of more than 1,000 people on the weekend from the Tianfu New Area in the city as well as five districts, two cities and one county under the city's administration.

There's buying the item your significant other has been eyeing, and then there's risking your life to save your partner's prized items.

The latter is exactly what one dedicated woman in Chongqing, China did.

Saving Gundam

The woman's boyfriend shared that on Aug. 19, there were forecasts of heavy rain and flooding.

Speaking to Chinese media over a phone interview, he said that he moved his belongings, including his beloved Gundam collection, from the first floor of his office to the second floor, as he had a feeling the water level would rise.

Subsequent forecasts then revealed that the water level would rise even further.

Worried for his and his girlfriend's safety, the man purchased an inflatable raft.

The boyfriend initially wanted to head back to rescue his Gundam figurines, but his girlfriend, who herself is an anime and manga fan, decided to go instead as he could not swim.

She added that at least if anything happened, she would be able to save herself.

She managed to get into the second floor of the office by breaking the window, meanwhile suffering a cut to her finger, Unilad reported.

The boyfriend also told Chinese media that while she was away, he was more concerned that the raft she was on would capsize, instead of losing his prized toys.

The girlfriend eventually returned with boxes of Gundam piled high on her raft.

Gundam is a Japanese animated series, which has spawned a huge industry of highly sought after figurines and collectibles.

Gundam figurines can be expensive, with some of the rare ones costing several hundreds.

Chongqing has been ravaged by floods recently, with authorities issuing a level one flood emergency on Aug. 20, the highest in a four-tier system.

Thousands of residents have been evacuated as well.

You can watch the full video, in Mandarin, of the Gundam rescue.

First of all is flood control, second is to provide a stable strategic rear base for the national reunification, and also for the development of water transport routes. Li Bing, governor of Shu for the state of Qin, and his son lead the construction. Instead of building a dam, they harnessed the river using a new method at that time: dividing the water. There are three main parts of the construction: The Yuzui (Fish Mouth Levee), the Feishayan (Flying Sand Weir) and the Baopingkou (Bottle-Neck Channel). Each has a different, indispensable function. The first Minjiang River barrier is Yuzui. It was built at the bend of the river, where the surging water is divided into the inner and outer rivers by the ""dikes"". The lateral canal drains the flood and the inner canal flows into the Chengdu Plain through Baopingkou.

The water that runs through Yuzui is less turbulent, but it still carries a lot of sand, and that's when Feishayan works. The weir has a opening that connects the inner and outer streams which allows the swirling flow to drain out excess water. Every year, the river workers clean the sand up, which effectively prevents the silting of the river from breaking its banks. The place where Baopingkou locates was Yulei Mountain. It took Li Bing and his team eight years to chisel the stone wall open to form the constant width for a thousand years. It was named Baopingkou (Bottle-Neck Channel) because of its shape.

62,62,FL-2020-000182-CHN,"Why China's Food Crisis Could Get Worse Amid Pests, Pestilence - Heritage.org",https://www.heritage.org/asia/commentary/why-chinas-food-crisis-could-get-worse-amid-pests-pestilence,"For the past 18 months, China’s farm and agriculture sectors have been pummeled by two different infestations.

African swine flu has killed millions of hogs as it’s spread south through China. Fall armyworms and locusts marched north, devouring millions of acres of crops along the way.

Recent mass flooding in China’s southern region and a new Chinese Communist Party edict calling on citizens to waste less food suggest China’s food crisis may be far from over.

African swine flu is an incurable and fatal disease that affects all pigs. The fall armyworm is an invasive, omnivorous insect that can consume large amounts of crops—including corn, sorghum, rice, and cotton—in a very short amount of time.

In 2019, the African swine flu killed 180 million swine, or nearly 40% of China’s pig population. Meanwhile, the fall armyworm infested nearly 3 million acres of cropland.

Those problems have led to a historic rise in the price of food in China. Pork prices in particular have risen the most (an 85% increase in July alone), which has also led to an increase in the price of substitutes, such as beef and lamb.

The price of fresh vegetables is up 8%.

But China’s food concerns don’t stop there.

Recent rain and flooding around China’s Yangtze River have affected 13 million acres of cropland, causing $21 billion in damages. It’s also made curbing the spread of African swine flu more difficult, as new cases are being reported.

These incidents led China to significantly increase its imports of foodstuffs.

China’s imports of animal and animal products (such as pigs and pork) and vegetable and vegetable products (such as soybeans and vegetable oils) increased fivefold in the first half of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.

China’s imports of meat increased from 8 billion Chinese renminbi (about $1.16 billion) in the first six months of 2019 to nearly 108 billion renminbi (about $15.6 billion) so far in 2020.

Imports of oil seeds (including soybeans) is up 117 billion renminbi (about $16.9 billion).

Although there’s nothing wrong with importing food, it just goes to show that China’s domestic farms are having their troubles.

The impact of recent flooding, on top of last year’s African swine flu epidemic and fall armyworm infestation, has spooked the Chinese Communist Party all the way to its highest level.

Just last week, Xinhua, a media outlet of the Chinese Communist Party, published quotes from President Xi Jinping urging citizens to stop wasting food—and threatening punishment for those who don’t follow guidelines.

That immediately led to food associations’ encouraging restaurants to sell less food to customers. It also led one restaurant to weigh incoming customers to help determine how much food they should eat.

Xi’s announcement also prompted TikTok’s sister app in China, Douyin, to issue a statement saying it would “penalize food-wasting behavior when spotted.” That will effectively mean the end to short, food-eating videos that are popular in Asia.

The increase in food prices also makes China’s recovery from the COVID-19 recession that much harder, as families are having to spend more of their incomes on necessities such as food instead of retail items.

China’s retail sector is still in the red as private demand has yet to fully recover.

Retail sales of apparel, jewelry, automobiles, audiovisual equipment, and household appliances are all down by double-digit percentages this year.

A silver lining from China’s growing need for food imports is the U.S.-China Phase One deal. The increased demand for food may help U.S. farmers who are hoping China can live up to the additional $12.5 billion in agriculture purchases Beijing has promised to make this year.

Although the current crisis is unlikely to get as bad as China’s famine in the 1950s that saw as many as 30 million die under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the increasing prices and excessive crackdown on food consumption doesn’t bode well for China’s internal political stability.","Fri, 21 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2020-08/GettyImages-1153721771.jpg?itok=b5SnkvDs,"['worse', 'flu', 'amid', 'led', 'china', 'pestilence', 'imports', 'food', 'increase', 'billion', 'pests', 'crisis', 'million', 'swine', 'chinas']",

-- The Yellow River basin, one of the most important ecological barriers and economic zones of China, has seen remarkable improvements in its ecological environment in recent years.

-- China has set the ecological protection and high-quality development of the Yellow River basin as a major national strategy.

-- With the mainstream of the Yellow River running through, Lanzhou, the capital city of northwestern China's Gansu Province, has made great efforts in carrying out the national strategy.

LANZHOU, Aug. 20 (Xinhua) -- Deemed ""the cradle of Chinese civilization,"" the Yellow River basin, one of the most important ecological barriers and economic zones of China, has seen remarkable improvements in its ecological environment in recent years.

With China adopting ecological protection and high-quality development of the Yellow River basin as a major national strategy, the river is expected to play a crucial role in striking a balance between environmental protection and economic growth.

ECOLOGICAL PROTECTION

The Yellow River originates from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and runs through the Loess Plateau. Flowing 5,464 km through nine provincial-level regions, it is China's second-longest river, supplying water to 12 percent of China's population and irrigating 15 percent of the country's arable land.

For provinces and regions on the upper stream of the river, ecological protection is among their top priorities.

With the mainstream and more than 20 tributaries of the river running through, the city of Lanzhou, capital of northwest China's Gansu Province, has made great efforts in implementing the national strategy.

As the old saying goes, ""When the Yellow River is harnessed, China will enjoy the tranquility."" Noting that peace of the Yellow River is significant to the stability of the country, Chinese people have struggled against the floods of the Yellow River since ancient times. The river has so far seen the fifth flood of this year due to continuous rainfall.

Standing at the river bank, Guo Dejun, head of the Lanzhou management center of the waterway, stared at the yellowish surface water. He said he is confident the newly-reinforced embankment would protect the city from the rushing flood.

With a total investment of 1.68 billion yuan (about 242 million U.S. dollars) and after five years of construction, the city's embankment project is nearing completion. It is aimed at tackling the menace of flood and bank collapse, as well as strengthening environmental protection and afforestation.

""Thanks to the project, in the past three years, floods have passed through the city without harming the 3 million residents,"" said Guo.

In the suburbs of Lanzhou, the city's largest sewage treatment plant is undergoing an upgrade. According to experts at the plant, the discharge standard of the city's sewage will rise to class A after completion of the other three sewage treatment plants.

Hydraulic engineers used drones to map the city's sewage exits leading to the waterway, with follow-up measures of monitoring pollutants and tracing sources of pollution.

""This year, we will seal all the exits of untreated wastewater to ensure clean water supply downstream,"" said Xing Lifeng, deputy director of Lanzhou Ecology and Environment Bureau.

Lanzhou is also located in an area with severe soil and water loss along the Yellow River basin. The river, which carries sand and dust from the Loess Plateau, is known as the most sediment-laden river in the world.

In order to combat soil erosion, the city has launched large-scale afforestation drives along the river banks since the 1950s and employed forest rangers to protect the forest resources. At present, Lanzhou has around 3,000 government-paid forest rangers.

Forest coverage along the river banks has helped reduce over 600,000 tonnes of soil erosion annually, according to Ren Zhibin, deputy director of the Lanzhou Mountainous Environment Engineering Headquarters.

QUALITY-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT

High-quality and coordinated development of the Yellow River basin started with adjustment and transformation of old industrial cities in the upper stream.

In Lanzhou, high-polluting factories were relocated and new industries marched in. Biomedicine, clean energy and new materials have replaced traditional heavy industries and became new drivers of the regional economy.

According to data from the Lanzhou Bureau of Industry and Information Technology, the added value of Lanzhou's emerging industry accounted for 15.3 percent of the city's GDP in 2019, up about 7 percentage points than that in 2015. The total number of high-tech industries more than doubled in 2019 from that in 2016.

Tourism has also become one of the city's pillar industries. Lanzhou received 82.1 million domestic and foreign tourists in 2019, a year-on-year increase of 22.2 percent. Besides, the total tourism revenue exceeded 76.65 billion yuan, up 29 percent year on year.

In May, Gansu and Qinghai, two important provinces on the upper stream of the Yellow River, reached an agreement for joint construction of the Lanzhou-Xining cluster to promote further cooperation in the ecological environment, education, urban and rural development, energy resources and agriculture.

Cities along the river are more open than before. In conjunction with the Belt and Road Initiative, China-Europe freight trains depart from inland cities like Lanzhou shipping goods to European countries.

For local people, life is getting better with improved river environment.

Almost every day around sunrise, Peng Xiaoling leaves home and runs along the riverbank. ""The walkway used to be dirty and broken. Now it is flat and surrounded by trees and flowers. I enjoy every moment running and walking along the river,"" said Peng.

Nabeel Pervaiz, a Pakistani national, came to China 10 years ago and witnessed the opening up of Lanzhou during the past decade. At present, he works at Lanzhou University. ""I had heard of the Yellow River before I came here. I really enjoy my life in the city,"" he said.

On summer nights, parks and fitness centers along the river in Lanzhou are crowded with people. Young couples savor their leisure hours sitting in cafes and bookstores. An outdoor cinema screens black and white movies, attracting the attention of the elderly and children.

""Now the river, the city and the people are living in harmony with each other,"" said Ma Bin, lead singer of a local band named Yeguyao.

BEIJING, Aug. 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday announced China will share the annual hydrological information of the Lancang River with Mekong countries starting from this year, to better address climate change as well as floods and droughts.

Li made the remarks while attending the third Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) leaders' meeting via video link from Beijing.

Calling the six Lancang-Mekong countries a de facto community with a shared future linked by the same water, Li said their cooperation originates from water, which is an important part of cooperation, and enriches the LMC spirit of friendship, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation.

Over the past four years since the mechanism was put in place, Lancang-Mekong countries have ramped up institutional cooperation on water resources, said the premier.

Li said the legitimate rights and interests of Lancang-Mekong countries to rationally develop and utilize water resources should be fully respected, and all parties' interests and concerns should be accommodated.

""China is willing to offer more assistance within its capacity to other Lancang-Mekong countries for better utilizing water resources,"" Li said.

In addition, China will join with other countries this year to build an information sharing platform of water resources cooperation, according to Li.

The premier also announced such moves as the regular holding of ministerial meetings and forums on water resources cooperation, the implementation of a five-year-plan on Lancang-Mekong water resources cooperation, as well as the implementation of cooperation programs on dam security and flood alerts.

69,69,FL-2020-000182-CHN,Is China running out of food? Xi Jinping’s ‘Clean Plates Campaign’ is causing rare anxiety - ThePrint,https://theprint.in/world/is-china-running-out-of-food-xi-jinpings-clean-plates-campaign-is-causing-rare-anxiety/486317/,"Text Size: A- A+

Singapore/Beijing: A new national campaign against food waste in China has sparked a rare bout of speculation over the government’s ability to safely feed its 1.4 billion citizens when faced with floods, epidemics, locusts and rising tensions with some of its biggest trading partners.

The sudden and massive push to curb the problem of discarded leftovers — known as the “Clean Plates Campaign” — has puzzled experts who keep a close watch on the world’s biggest consumer of everything from grains to meat. Government officials have stressed that the country’s food reserves are ample, but some observers have nevertheless questioned the timing of a campaign aimed at reducing consumption when China’s economy is still recovering from the effects of the coronavirus epidemic.

Bloomberg spoke with almost a dozen agricultural traders, food company officials and industry researchers this week about the initiative, the majority of whom said they believed the push was targeted at reducing dependence on food imports in preparation for possible supply disruptions. China’s Ministry of Agriculture did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“Fears of supply disruptions due to Covid-19 have caused China’s leaders to re-emphasize food security and self-sufficiency,” said Darin Friedrichs, a senior analyst at StoneX Group Inc. in Shanghai. “This includes diversifying where grain is sourced from abroad, but also making efforts to reduce food waste domestically,” he said.

Political tensions have threatened trade flows in some commodities, and earlier this year governments started reducing exports and safeguarding local supplies because of worries over the coronavirus — limiting the availability of food shipments to other countries. Heavily reliant on protein imports to feed its citizens, concerns about breaks in the global food supply chain are particularly salient for China, whose Communist Party leaders have long made economic development and personal enrichment a centerpiece of their rule.

The world could be facing “multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months,” Executive Director of the World Food Programme David Beasley warned in April, citing the impact of the coronavirus epidemic as well as more frequent natural disasters and changing weather patterns.

Pestilence and locusts

Biblical developments have contributed to concerns over China’s food supply this year. The country’s southern provinces have experienced massive flooding and swarms of locusts. Pork prices are beginning to tick up, even as China attempts to rebuild its supply of pigs after an outbreak of African Swine Fever devastated herds, contributing to an overall jump in food inflation.

Fears that imported goods might be contaminated by the coronavirus have added to the pressure, with the southern city of Guangzhou ordering cold storage companies to suspend imports of frozen meat and seafood from virus-hit regions after the local government in nearby Shenzhen discovered Covid-19 on chicken wings imported from Brazil.

President Xi Jinping’s push to tackle the “shocking and distressing” problem of discarded leftovers has been swift and intense, with the national legislature scheduled to fast-track new rules as part of the effort. Livestreamers who film themselves eating huge amounts of food have been censured (such ‘eating shows’ are popular in parts of North Asia), while catering associations have urged restaurants to put limits on the number of dishes patrons can order.

Xi has been encouraging his country to build-up its domestic economic strength in the face of intensifying external risks, including rising tensions with the U.S. Some veteran China watchers believe the food waste campaign, kicked off by the president last week, is part of a similar long-term effort to increase self-sufficiency in food. Agriculture Minister Han Changfu stressed this month the importance of keeping the people’s rice bowl filled with locally grown grain.

The campaign suggests that the government has started preparing for a theoretical worst-case scenario of a food supply shortage, said three of the people surveyed by Bloomberg. They declined to be identified given the topic’s sensitivity in a country where food holds pride of place in many homes, and where memories of the Great Famine under Chairman Mao Zedong still linger.

“Food security is an important foundation for state security. Food wastage appears to be about individual behavior, but it could lead to extensive perils,” a People’s Daily analysis said last week. There are about 35 million tons of food wasted in China every year, representing almost 6% of total output, it said. Food supply in China will be tightly balanced for an extended period given rising costs, limited resources and solid demand, the analysis added.

Great decoupling in grains

China’s rapid economic development has drastically altered the nation’s food needs, with citizens in cosmopolitan coastal provinces demanding much more meat, chocolate, wine and coffee in recent years. That’s helped contribute to skyrocketing consumption of animal feed, and dramatically increased China’s dependence on foreign crops including American soybeans, Australian barley, and African cocoa and coffee beans.

So far there’s no sign that China has been procuring less food from overseas. Imports of farm products have been growing fast this year, with purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans accelerating in recent months. China has also boosted its estimate for soybean imports for the current marketing year to a record of 96 million tons, citing strong demand for protein-rich soymeal for animal feed.

Although U.S. exports of agricultural and related products to China in the first half of this year reached about 20% of the 2020 target of $36.5 billion agreed under the phase one deal, the Trump administration still says Beijing is trying to comply with the agreement. Shipments were 6.3% higher than the same period in 2019, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

“They’re buying a ton of commodities, particularly agriculture commodities,” Larry Kudlow, Trump’s top economic adviser, told Fox News on Thursday. “So far, so good.”

Still, China has often used trade restrictions to advance its geopolitical goals. Xi’s government halted some beef imports from Australia, and placed tariffs on the country’s barley shipments in May following the conclusion of an earlier anti-dumping probe. China’s ambassador to Canberra said in April that his country’s consumers might choose to boycott Australian goods.

“In the context of the Great Decoupling, Beijing will, where possible, buy from countries in its sphere of political and economic influence,” Diana Choyleva, chief economist at Enodo Economics, wrote in a report published last week, noting that the country’s large grain reserves were likely “overstated.”

A spokesman for China’s National Bureau of Statistics said at a press conference this month that the country has relatively sufficient grain stocks thanks to bumper harvests over the past five years. Grains harvested this summer — which include wheat and early rice — have increased by 0.9% over the previous year to a new record despite the floods, the spokesman said. Grains harvested in the fall account for over 70% of the nation’s total production and should be unscathed by the summer flooding.

While the intrusiveness of the “Clean Plates Campaign” has led to it being dissected and occasionally criticized on social media, some have interpreted the move as a simple reminder to avoid unnecessary excess. Two of the industry executives interviewed by Bloomberg said that Xi’s campaign was a continuation of policies to reduce waste going back to at least 2013.

Meanwhile, the Global Times has rejected “media hype” and suggestions that the campaign might be connected to a looming food shortage, saying that it is merely about “an issue that deserves more attention.” – Bloomberg

The Leshan Giant Buddha in the province of Sichuan — the largest Buddha statue in the world — was partly submerged by ongoing floods in Southern China last week, reports Smithsonian Magazine. A pilgrimage destination for Buddhists and part of the Mount Emei Scenic Area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the 233-feet-tall, 1,300-year-old monument had not been endangered by rising waters for at least seven decades.

The Leshan Buddha was carved in the 8th century CE on the hillside of Xijuo Peak, overlooking the junction of the Minjiang, Qingyi and Dadu Rivers. It depicts Maitreya, a bodhisattva (an individual on the path to becoming a buddha) and disciple of Siddhārtha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism.

This year has brought unusually heavy flooding in central and southwestern China, killing hundreds and displacing millions more. The Mount Emei site was closed to tourists last week and officials surrounded the statue with sandbags in an attempt to protect it, but water managed to rise high enough to cover the Buddha’s enormous toes. (If it were to stand upright, the Buddha would be almost eye-to-eye with the Statue of Liberty, and 100 monks are said to be able to sit on one foot at once.)

Although the Chinese government has spent millions in its preservation and restoration, the statue is at risk of erosion by rainwater and air pollution, especially as the climate emergency worsens. In December 2018, one large-scale study found that 49 UNESCO World Heritage Sites are threatened by rising sea levels.

According to the media outlet Xinhua, the authorities in Sichuan, where the Leshan’s Buddha is located, activated the highest level of emergency flood control response on Tuesday for the first time on record. Incessant rainfall has caused 22 major rivers in Sichuan to exceed their flood warning levels, and water reached the toes of the Buddha for the first time since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, the outlet reported.","Mon, 24 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i1.wp.com/hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/29661827467_e4f89e70dd_k-1.jpg?fit=1000%2C618&quality=100&ssl=1,"['toes', 'statue', 'largest', 'sichuan', 'leshan', 'threatened', 'china', 'week', 'water', 'unesco', 'waters', 'rising', 'world', 'buddha']",

Xi’s Latest Purge Reflects Climate of Fear

Xi Jinping Still Rules by Fear

Chinese President Xi Jinping’s latest round of purges targets the police and judicial sectors, with dozens of officials already arrested, including at least one major police chief. Xi has made these kinds of sweeping crackdowns a key feature of his rule, beginning with the elimination of his chief political rivals after he took power and continuing with key institutions, such as state-owned enterprises and the military.

Xi’s defenders say the purges are part of anti-corruption work, and it’s likely that some of the cases involve unusually corrupt officials. But anti-corruption crackdowns carried out under the auspices of the Chinese Communist Party auspices tend to follow a familiar pattern. The price of luxuries—a useful proxy for corruption, since bribes often involve exchanges of luxury goods—fell during Xi’s first rounds of purges and then hit record highs before the coronavirus pandemic.

Eight years in, rule by fear still seems to be Xi’s watchword both inside and outside the party.

Reformist expelled. Prominent reformist CCP intellectual Cai Xia, meanwhile, was formally expelled from the party and stripped of her retirement benefits this week. Cai, who now lives in the United States, is a fierce critic of Xi’s leadership—views she says are shared by many inside the party itself. Cai told the Guardian that China under Xi is trapped in a cycle of sycophancy and fear.

“But those below are too afraid to tell him and wrong decisions continue to be made until the situation is out of control,” she said. “In this vicious cycle, there is no way to stop the country from sliding towards disaster.”

No exit. Even if resentment toward Xi’s leadership is growing, nobody in the party has the ability to act. Short of a full-blown coup or a health crisis for Xi, the entire system is locked in to ideological paranoia, yes-man thinking, and an increasing personality cult. Xi himself may be aware of these problems—but like dictators before him, he’s learning that it’s hard to order people who are terrified of you to speak their minds.

What We’re Following

Workers’ Stadium demolished. One of Beijing’s key sites, the Workers’ Stadium, was ripped down in just four days this week, ahead of a planned reconstruction for the 2022 Winter Olympics. Beijing’s systematic demolitions over the last few years have painfully reshaped the city. But while the 66,000-seat Workers’ Stadium carries strong memories for anyone who attended an event there, it’s not exactly an architectural loss.

Like many other demolitions, it comes with a commercial cost: The stadium had a penumbra of clubs and stores surrounding it that are now closed. The peculiar juxtaposition of night life and a communist monument was the result of the People’s Liberation Army’s direct ownership of the stadium and the land around it, which meant that club owners only had to bribe a single PLA representative.

Wetting the Buddha’s toes. The record-setting rains and flooding in southern China continues, with the waters now reaching the toes of a famous statue of the Buddha in Leshan that normally sits well above the confluence of the Min and Dadu rivers, for the first time since 1949. The Three Gorges Dam is facing the largest inflow since it was completed in 2006, although claims that the dam is in imminent danger of collapse are exaggerated.

The Chinese government is waging a complicated battle against the waters, diverting as much as possible onto farmland while evacuating other areas and issuing warnings across entire provinces.

Hong Kong’s nadir. The Public Opinion Programme, which has conducted research on Hong Kong since 1997, found opinions of its five key indicators—prosperity, stability, rule of law, freedom, and democracy—reached a record low in the city this week. The most significant drop was in prosperity: Hong Kong’s economy has faced a straight year of recession and shows no signs of recovery.

The other ratings already saw sharp declines following last year’s police brutality and government intransigence and the passage of Beijing’s draconian national security law in June.

Tech and Business

Is Alibaba next? U.S. President Donald Trump issued yet another sweeping set of security restrictions this week, this time aimed at perpetual bugbear Huawei. The new move targets chip sellers, potentially crippling Huawei’s production chain. China has attempted to speed up its own semiconductor development, including espionage attempts directed at Taiwanese and U.S. firms, but is still a long way behind even its initial goal of 40 percent domestic production.

The response from the Chinese state and media was strong, but it’s unlikely to change anything. The new restrictions may mean that Huawei gets the funds it needs to survive directly from government-linked institutions.

In the meantime, Trump openly mused about imposing restrictions on Alibaba, China’s logistical giant. It’s hard to see any national security justification for such a move, outside of Alibaba’s cloud services, but it would be a key step in forcing U.S.-China decoupling. A flood of Alibaba-sourced products have appeared on Amazon in recent years through third-party sellers.

Back to Xi’s future. China is attempting to develop a science-fiction movie sector where the first priority is to “thoroughly study and implement Xi Jinping Thought.” The plans follow a familiar pattern of state criticism of domestic creative industries. The supposed solution is always more top-down direction, government instruction, and ideological correctness.

But the emphasis on politically approved domestic blockbusters may make things trickier for Hollywood, which already self-censors to access the Chinese market. It’s possible that U.S. studios will face demands to actively promote Xi-ist ideals, leaving them on a collision course with a U.S. government increasingly hostile toward accommodation of Chinese authoritarianism.

Trade talks delayed. Trump has canceled follow-on trade talks for the supposed “phase two” of the U.S.-China trade agreement—at this point a zombie deal, staggering on under its own undead weight. Asked by reporters, Trump said that he wasn’t even thinking about the deal and again blamed China for failing to stop the coronavirus—a recurrent theme in recent weeks.

What We’re Watching

Avatar: The Last Airbender

This delightful animated young adult favorite, originally made between 2005 and 2009, is now streaming on Netflix. The U.S. series is notable for China watchers because it does something that China itself has never managed: It makes a fantasy world rooted in East Asian culture that reaches a global audience.

The Chinese influence on Avatar goes deep, depicting martial arts practice, recreating Japanese invasions and colonies in Manchuria, and referencing modern-day authoritarianism such as laogai (labor camps) and sinister guards named after real-life secret police heads. As Jeannette Ng points out, that depth is arguably missing from the show’s own sequel.

That’s it for this week.

76,76,FL-2020-000182-CHN,We All Should Have Listened to Steve Bannon - OZY,https://www.ozy.com/news-and-politics/we-all-should-have-listened-to-steve-bannon/372539/,"Because if Trump had listened to his former chief strategist about the pandemic, our world might look a lot better.

The former White House chief strategist, now charged with fraud, was spot-on with his early warnings about the coronavirus.

But given his anti-China bent and declared propensity to “flood the zone with shit,” few took him seriously.

Until Thursday, when federal agents escorted him off a 150-foot yacht moored in Long Island Sound, the word often used to describe Steve Bannon was “irrelevant.” Oh, the former chief strategist of the Trump White House has been busy, frenetically so: He broadcasts a daily coronavirus-focused podcast War Room: Pandemic, oversees the Committee on the Present Danger: China and chairs the $100 million Rule of Law Fund, which investigates the disappearances of Chinese public figures. And still he found time to partake in We Build the Wall, a “volunteer” effort to erect a border structure not far from El Paso with $25 million in private donations, “not a penny” of which would go to anything but the wall.

Few followed his activities, especially the press. Viewed as a media whore, Bannon by 2020 was a washed-up snore: The only platforms that paid him any attention were Fox’s Sunday Morning Futures and CNBC’s Squawk Box, where he often appears, calling coronavirus “the CCP virus” — a reference to the Chinese Communist Party, which Bannon blames for obfuscating the reality about the pathogen — and warning about the dangers of Chinese-owned companies Huawei and TikTok. Even when the GOP commissioned a 57-page strategy memo that appeared to be a compilation of Bannon’s blame-China talking points and even after President Donald Trump’s Bannonesque move toward banning TikTok in the U.S., the media still yawned at mention of his name; if it came up, it was typically in reference to his directive to distract from PR woes by “flooding the zone with shit.”

That changed this week, when Bannon was arrested, hauled into federal court in Manhattan and charged with fraud for allegedly siphoning off more than a few pennies from the We Build the Wall fund. Pleading not guilty and promising to surrender his passport, he was released on a $5 million bond and strutted out of the New York courthouse, waving at the assembled cameras.

Far from appearing like someone worried that he could be facing 20 years behind bars, Bannon looked ebullient: He was back in the game, again worthy of front-page headlines.

In March, Bannon called for a complete and total shutdown, hoping to “smash the curve.”

As the Wall Street Journal reported only the day before, Bannon is also under investigation for business dealings with controversial Chinese dissident billionaire Guo Wengui — on whose yacht Bannon was arrested — and who underwrites the Rule of Law Fund and Bannon’s podcast, blasting it through China’s firewall.

Now that Bannon is spiking on the newsworthy charts, the media is having a field day, slamming him as a fraudster, shyster, liar and crook, reveling in his alleged dubious financial dealings detailed in the 35-page indictment.

Across social media, Bannon’s arrest was met with elation by Trump’s most ardent detractors — as if the charges slapped on Bannon, who as CEO of the Trump campaign in 2016 is credited with getting The Apprentice showman into office, were being slapped on the president himself.

But Bannon is not Trump: While the latter rarely appears to grasp complexities such as China and the coronavirus, Bannon has shown prescience with both. Starting in the first weeks of this year, he began loudly ringing the alarm about coronavirus, warning it would become a pandemic that could kill millions and would cripple the global supply chain and crush the world economy. Few listened, save his friend Peter Navarro, who like other White House advisers tunes into Bannon’s podcast, and who in late January wrote a memo warning of a potential coronavirus disaster, a memo which his boss didn’t bother to read.

The clue that this new disease, which Bannon’s podcast first reported on in late December, was way bigger than China was letting on, Bannon says, was when the Chinese government took the unprecedented step of canceling the Lunar New Year celebration.

Suspecting Beijing was covering up the reality of coronavirus — an act he told me constitutes a “biological Chernobyl” — he predicted that China would “vacuum up all the personal protective equipment” from the world market, worsening the fate for other countries as it spread.

Realizing that “the world wasn’t prepared,” and the press “was dropping the ball,” he tried drumming up media interest, forecasting that coronavirus, which then appeared to be contained in Wuhan, would be “the issue that 2020 pivoted on.” He interviewed epidemiologists, virologists, China experts, economists and manufacturers of personal protective equipment on his podcast. Few seemed to notice.

As architect of the Muslim travel ban, foremost defender of dropping out of the Paris climate accord, an adviser to far-right groups in Europe and a loud advocate of “the Wall,” Bannon had already flooded his own zone with so much shit that nobody was listening when this time he had news of actual importance.

In early February, Bannon flew to Los Angeles to appear on Real Time With Bill Maher, believing he would be talking about COVID-19 and what the U.S. needed to do to prepare. Once there, though, Maher wouldn’t let him touch the subject. Instead, the host pummeled his guest with combative questions about Trump, whom Bannon staunchly defended. Maher concluded by saying, “I wish we had someone on our side as evil as you, Steve.”

When the World Health Organization announced in March that the coronavirus was indeed a pandemic, and cases began spiking in the U.S., Bannon called for a complete and total shutdown — one that would have banned all international travel, travel between states, even shipment of most goods, hoping to “smash the curve.” He was laughed off as alarmist, though just this week White House coronavirus task force chief Dr. Deborah Birx said she wished the U.S. had taken such a route, as Italy did. So it’s lamentable that back when the COVID-19 pandemic could have been slowed, few heeded Bannon’s call. While his podcast has made iffy claims — among them heralding hydroxychloroquine as an effective COVID “therapeutic,” speculating that the virus escaped from a Wuhan lab and lambasting Dr. Anthony Fauci — the high-caliber guests assured that listeners could sift out informational gems.

Now that’s less likely: The podcast, while still taking aim at China — and legitimately questioning the rise of companies such as Huawei, which has become a bipartisan concern — has devolved into a cheering section for Trump and a forum to attack Joe Biden. And given Bannon’s indictment, the zone will surely be flooded with conspiracies about the so-called deep state. It’s a shame with all of that flooding, we may miss it again the next time he’s actually onto something.

Data from the National Climate Center show the Yangtze River Basin has seen about 54 percent more rain than average for two months, while the Huaihe River Basin had about 43 percent more. The heavy rain in June and July, which caused flooding in many parts of China, was the longest lasting among records dating back to 1961.

Some regions had 30 percent of their average annual rainfall in just one day, and many places, including Lu'an in Anhui province and Poyang county in Jiangxi province, have set rainfall records in the past two months. ""In general, the climate this year is pretty extraordinary,"" said Jia Xiaolong, deputy head of the center. He said the continuous heavy rainfall occurred against the backdrop of global warming, which had caused the number of rainstorm days in China to increase by an average of 3.9 percent every 10 years for the past six decades.

This year, the Indian Ocean has seen its temperature rise above normal, causing a stronger subtropical high to affect China. Meanwhile, active cold air from the north has met warm air in the south, resulting in frequent heavy rainfall, he said.

Wang Pengling, a senior engineer at the center, said that due to its large latitudinal span and range of landforms, China has complicated climate types and is especially vulnerable to climate change. China has witnessed a temperature rise averaging 0.24 C per decade since the 1950s, significantly higher than the global average rise during the same period, Wang said. The World Meteorological Organization said in a report released in September that the global average temperature has increased by 1.1 C since 1880.

""China's ecologically fragile areas overlap with populous areas to a great extent, which further intensifies disaster risks brought by climate change,"" Wang said. He called for more research on how extreme weather leads to disasters to better inform the public of the risks. ""Research findings indicate that global warming will continue,"" Wang said. ""Under high emission scenarios globally, both the frequency and intensity of rainstorms in China will increase, raising the risks of floods. Low-carbon lifestyles should be encouraged worldwide, and cities need to enhance their adaptability to climate change.""

DHAKA, Aug. 20 (Xinhua) -- The loss of crops due to floods in Bangladesh has been put at 13.23 billion taka (about 156.4 million U.S. dollars).

Bangladeshi Agriculture Minister Abdur Razzaque told journalists on Wednesday that crops on 1.58 lakh hectares of land in 37 districts has been destroyed fully or partially, adding so far floods has hit Bangladesh for three times this year.

At least 14 districts were affected by flooding between June 25 and July 9 in the first phase when some 343,957 farmers were affected and crops worth about 3.49 billion taka damaged.

According to the minister, 37 districts were hit by flooding between July 11 and Aug. 12 again.

In the second and third phases, he said some 929,194 farmers were affected and crops worth about 9.74 billion taka damaged.

Razzaque said they have already started implementing a rehabilitation program for 239,631 farmers in the flood hit districts.

Floods triggered by heavy seasonal rains and onrush of water from hills have still continued unabated in some parts of Bangladesh, leaving a trail of death, misery and destruction in their wake.

The floods in parts of Bangladesh have killed at least 226 since June 30, authorities said Wednesday.

According to the daily flood report of the country's Health Emergency Operation Centre and Control Room on Wednesday, most victims have drowned but some died in snake bites and lightning in the flood-hit areas.

Commercial satellite imagery of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor, the country’s main nuclear facility, caught the attention of analysts at 38 North, a North-Korea analysis website funded by the Washington-based Stimson Center.

38 North reported that although the five-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon does not appear to have been recently operating, ""damage to the pumps and piping within the pump houses presents the biggest vulnerability to the reactors.""

""If the reactors were operating, for instance, the inability to cool them would require them to be shut down,"" the report said.

RFA’s Korean Service Thursday interviewed Olli Heinonen, former Deputy Director-General for Safeguards at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and current distinguished fellow with the Stimson Center’s 38 North program.

He discussed the potential damage that the flooding could cause to Yongbyon and the Pyongsan uranium mine, another flooded facility. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

RFA: It has been reported that the North Korean nuclear facility in Yongbyon was affected by the recent flooding. Do we have a major catastrophe on our hands?

Heinonen: As you know, I have been several times to Yongbyon, and I have also been there during flooding, and actually this flooding is about as bad as I think I saw when I was there. I think the first big flood I saw there, maybe it was in 1992, that long ago.

So I think my first reaction to these images, which also come from the organization which I now serve, the Stimson Center, … North Korea is aware of this flooding, they don’t come as a surprise, and they have taken some countermeasures in the design of these nuclear facilities to overcome any troubles. This is the first point, and I’ll return to it soon.

The second thing we need to keep in our mind is actually that these facilities are practically not operating now. So when you look at the satellite image survey, the five-megawatt reactor doesn’t operate, the experimental light-water reactor is under construction, the processing plant is far away from the river, but it still needs water in order to maintain it.

Same issue the uranium enrichment part, they need some water but the actual operation, we are not so sure how much it’s operating now. And then there are some other installations that use radioactive material. Not nuclear material, but [they conduct] radioactive experiments for medical, scientific and other purposes.

I don’t think this flooding has had much of an effect on those, so from an overall safety point of view, there is not a huge concern for the time being.

The next question: Has this flooding caused damage to the equipment there?

I don’t think there is any huge damage for the following reasons:

Let’s look now at the experimental light-water reactor and the five-megawatt reactor. I think that they can go for a while without having much water in use, or taken from the river, so they can stop the pumps… In addition to that, these kinds of installations, when they operate, they have a kind of filtering system in the front of the piping that takes the water. So it will also sieve away some of the dirt, so if they need to temporarily take some water I think they can perhaps manage it.

But certainly under current circumstances, you cannot go to long-term operations until the water level comes down, and until the front of these water-taking places are cleaned and put back in full order.

So this is my take on this, and I have seen them also designing and participating in a reactor that was built in Syria. And I was at that point in the IAEA and we have actually written some Syria reports about the water for that reactor…and it was I think, a fairly normal industrial arrangement for the water to be taken from the river, and how this system was made in such a way that it can handle also flooding.

Now we see that the intake building or the pump house in Yongbyon, particularly for the reactor, is surrounded by water, but I don’t think that it makes a huge damage on that because at least in Syria we saw that the electronics part was fairly well protected.

Then I also see that the people have not looked at the other water intake places. They are all concentrated only on water intake for the five-megawatt reactor and the experimental reactor.

On the other side of the river is a pump house which probably takes water to the river… and the situation there is pretty much the same as for the reactor, so there is a lot of water around the pump house… so that’s where we are.

So I don’t think that there is any dramatic situation. They need to do some fixing, but it’s not very likely that they are all destroyed.

There is one thing that people also need to remember. The construction of the buildings, in North Korea, their standards are not that advanced as you and I have become used to.

For example when it rains a lot, in some facilities, water can get to the cellar because of the poor isolation in the basement. So that’s another thing that is probably taking place in some of the facilities. We’re just not seeing it because satellite imagery will not show it.

What kind of damage has that caused? It’s hard to say. Most likely they just need to pump some water away and clean the premises, the cellars, and the lower levels of those buildings.

But again, I don’t think it will stop the operation of those facilities, since it didn’t do anything in the 1990s, so why would it do that today?

RFA: What is the danger of flooding at the Pyongsan uranium mine?

Heinonen: When you do the uranium mining, you use a lot of water to clean the ore, which in this case is anthracite coal in Pyongsan. So you have to clean it, you have to dissolve it, and then when you do this cleaning and this dissolution, you recover uranium, which is fine, but the same time you leave a lot of radioactive waste like radium, thorium, and then both of those, they are radioactive materials, so at one point in time, they decay to radon, which is a gas.

So, when you have these big ponds where the wastewater goes, we don’t know how well they are designed and how they deal hen there is a huge rain—whether the rain just falls into these open ponds, or whether they overflow and then this radioactive waste gets to the environment, groundwater, and then eventually either to the river, or to the drinking water of the people.

If that takes place, then it has an impact.

Also, we don’t know how well these ponds are actually made. In normal cases, actually they are like huge swimming pools. So they are not such that there is a pond or lake on a normal rice paddy or normal ground. You need to isolate this waste liquid from the rest of the ground water.

Since we don’t know how they have done that, I think that’s why when we look at this heavy rain, which was also in the Pyongsan area, that might be a matter of concern.

There is a possibility that water might overflow and get to the environment.

I’m not so worried about the milling facility itself, the one that takes the ore and separates uranium there, because they are chemical processes and they happen in piping and vessels and various tanks, so it should not impact the operations of those.

But the waste containment ponds are a different story. When you look at the image on the website, there are actually two such ponds. One is near the actual mine, up there on the mountain, and then there is a pipeline that [connects with the] milling facility, and then the liquids, which are waste from that milling facility, they cross the river in another pipe and go to a pond over there.

So those two ponds, one on the other side of the river and one up there on the mountain, I think, may have some risks when there is such a heavy rain as we have seen in the last couple of weeks.

Large volumes of water from neighbouring Sukhothai province have caused the river's water level to surge rapidly. Chinnawat Singha

Communities along the Yom River in Sukhothai were flooded with up to two metres of water on Monday after a dyke was damaged by strong currents following heavy rain upstream.

The flooding saw houses in Si Samrong, Si Satchanalai and Muang districts inundated by water as high as a single-storey house, forcing residents to seek safety on higher ground.

The torrents of water from Nan and Phrae tore down a 50-metre concrete dyke on Sunday. More sections of the dyke were damaged on Monday, worsening the floods in several areas.

The flooding brought down 20 electricity poles along Pak Kwair-Wang Mai Khon Road in Muang district, forcing Sukhothai's Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) to cut off power to several parts of Muang district and hampering search and rescue efforts.

Sukhothai has become the latest casualty of the floods which have ravaged 10 provinces since last week. The floods were brought rain from by Tropical Storm Higos, which wreaked havoc in Nan and Phrae as it made its way through the North.

So far, severe floods have been reported in 553 villages across 10 northern provinces, according to the official tally kept by the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department under the Interior Ministry.

However, authorities fear that more floods will be reported as the storm slowly moves towards Laos.

Excess water from Nan and Phrae is expected to flow downstream for the next seven days. As such, there have been flood warnings in Sukhothai, Phitsanulok and Phichit.

In Phichit, irrigation officials are bracing for a surge of water which is expected to flow down the Yom River in the next couple of days.

Sluice gates along the Yom River have been fully raised to allow the Royal Irrigation Department to divert overflowing water from the river into its tributaries and canals, said the head of Phichit's Irrigation Department, Amnart Inthawongkaew, on Monday.

In another development, rising water levels along the Mekong River in Nakhon Phanom are threatening local farms and fisheries along the river.

Water levels along the Mekong have been rising at a rate of 20-30 centimetres per day. As of Monday, the level stood at 9 metres -- just 4m below the spill-over threshold -- prompting officials to warn villagers in Ban Phaeng, Tha Uthen, Muang and That Phanom districts to secure their belongings.","Tue, 25 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2020/08/25/3729783_700.jpg,"['muang', 'bursts', 'phrae', 'water', 'sukhothai', 'nan', 'irrigation', 'flooding', 'floods', 'yom', 'river', 'dyke']",

Edward Barsley, author of Retrofitting for Flood Resilience, outlines six key strategies for creating environments that are adapted to flooding.

In the book Retrofitting for Flood Resilience: A Guide to Building & Community Design, Barsley outlines how urban and natural environments can be adapted to reduce the impact of flooding.

""Flood resilient design can significantly reduce the exposure and vulnerability of communities and both the natural and built environment to the impact of flooding and help those affected recover quicker,"" he told Dezeen.

""Flood resilient design should not just be seen as a necessity""

Barsley believes the adaptations that need to be made to protect areas from rising sea levels could also be an opportunity to improve the world's cities.

""Flood resilient design should not just be seen as a necessity, but as an opportunity through which to deliver wider benefits such as improved biodiversity and to enhance the quality of placemaking in communities throughout the world,"" he continued.

Related story Zaha Hadid Architects carves out sculptural flood protection barrier in Hamburg

According to Barsley, who heads up design-research led practice The Environmental Design Studio, architects should be thinking about how they can positively impact these environments.

""The frequency and severity of flood events is increasing as a result of climate change, and it's an issue that demands urgent and collective action, particularly given that by 2025 it is predicted that three-quarters of the world's population will reside in coastal zones, many of which will be exposed or vulnerable to the impacts of flooding,"" explained Barsley.

""Architects have the ability to influence and affect change at a variety of scales and so it is vitally important they are aware of the many different strategies that can be used to improve the resilience of the natural and built environment.""

""There is no single 'silver bullet' strategy""

In the book, which is published by RIBA, Barsley outlines various strategies that could be used to manage flood risk that he grouped into six spatial tactics: attenuate, alleviate, restrict, realign, create and embrace.

""There is no single 'silver bullet' strategy that will solve the problem of flooding in every location, each type of flooding has different characteristics that influence the suitability of a design strategy,"" said Barsley.

""When you factor in different construction materials, house types, ground conditions, conservation policies and user preferences you realise that every approach needs to be developed to suit its given context.""

Here Barsley describes the six spatial tactics:

Alleviate – Yanweizhou Park by Turenscape

An alleviation strategy will increase the capacity of a water system, or provide supplementary areas that can be flooded, to reduce peak flood levels and limit the extent to which vulnerable locations are exposed to flood risk.

An example of this approach can be seen in Yanweizhou Park project by Turenscape where they persuaded the city authority to remove the flood walls, which were stifling the dynamics of the wetland ecosystem, and use a cut-and-fill terracing strategy so that the park could accommodate additional flood water, thereby reducing the flood risk to the city and surrounding areas.

Attenuate – Saint Kjeld's Kvarter by Tredje Natur

Attenuation uses natural or artificial structures and spaces to reduce the velocity and/or turbidity of water. This increases the time it takes for a given volume of water to move along the pathway and provides increased opportunity for infiltration.

An example of this approach can be seen in the first ""Climate District"" being developed in Copenhagen by Tredje Natur. Streetscapes are being retrofitted into ""Cloudburst Roads"", which provide green routes for cyclists, pedestrians and vehicles, while also functioning (in the event of heavy rainfall) as channels through which water can be slowed, stored, conveyed and discharged into the harbour.

Restrict – BIG U by BIG

Projects that focus on restriction reduce a community's exposure to flood risk by preventing water entry through the use of soft and hard flood risk management measures.

An example of this approach can be seen in BIG's BIG U project in New York, a 16-kilometre-long system that is being developed to help protect Manhattan from flooding. In each neighbourhood, the system is tailored with a particular set of programmes and functions at a variety of scales.

Realign – New York Rising Community Reconstruction

Realigning means reducing exposure to flood risk by repositioning critical infrastructure, properties or changing the land use classification.

An example of elements of this approach can be seen in the ""managed retreat"" being undertaken in areas such as Oakwood Beach in Staten Island as part of the NY Rising Community Reconstruction Program where hundreds of buildings have been bought out and demolished in an effort to restore the land to its natural floodplain functions.

In other similar contexts, buildings are being dismantled or picked up in their entirety and relocated to lower flood risk areas.

When it comes to vertical realignment, we identified a number of examples where homeowners have reduced the exposure of their properties to flood risk by adding an extra storey, and reconfiguring their living areas so that the ground floor zone becomes a non-habitable space.

Create – CPH Harbor Blue Plan by Tredje Natur

This involves constructing or generating new landforms and structures in or near water bodies onto which development and, or alternative land uses can be assigned.

An example of this can be seen in Krønlob Island development by COBE, Vilhelm Lauritzen Architects, Sted, Ramboll and Per Aarsleff and the CPH Harbor Blue Plan by Tredje Natur that both propose the creation of new landforms.

Embrace – Resilient Boston Harbor by SCAPE

Projects that embrace flooding accept that water will be a feature within the scheme and use it as a design driver to organise and adapt the built / natural environment in a contextually appropriate manner.

An example of this can be seen in the USA, where SCAPE has been working alongside the City of Boston to create a vision for a ""Resilient Boston Harbor"". Interventions include elevated landscapes, protective parks and the resilient retrofit of vulnerable buildings.","Mon, 17 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2020/08/Yanweizhou-Park-by-Turenscape_dezeen_936_4-1.jpg,"['environments', 'natural', 'creating', 'floodresilient', 'design', 'risk', 'flood', 'water', 'flooding', 'example', 'seen', 'reduce', 'strategies', 'resilient']",

Nearly 1,500 acres of rice fields were flooded and about 730 single-story homes and 179 housing blocks destroyed as of early August, North Korea says.

Kim's decision to use his reserves may be a worrisome development.

Severe flooding caused by intense monsoon rains have prompted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un into an atypical response that may signal a dire situation in the isolated country amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Nearly 1,500 acres of rice fields have flooded and about 730 single-story homes and 179 housing blocks have been destroyed as of early August, North Korea has announced.

Rains during monsoon seasons have typically devastated North Korea due to its lacking infrastructure. Around 15% of the country's arable land was destroyed by floods in 1990s, according to one estimate, and a separate study estimated that over 2 million people died. North Korea claims that roughly 225,000 died during this period.

Earlier this month, Kim toured villages damaged by recent flooding. While Kim's visits throughout the country are not unusual, as they allow state media outlets to disseminate propaganda, his directives on the current situation did catch the attention of North Korea observers.

According to the the regime's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), Kim ordered grain from his special food reserves to be dispensed to victims of the recent flooding. The regime also claimed that no one from the county Kim visited died in the flooding, though similar flooding has killed dozens in South Korea and China.

""It is of primary importance to immediately supply the victims with bedding, daily necessaries, medicines and other necessities to stabilize their living as early as possible,"" KNCA quoted Kim as noting.

""Upon receiving the grain, the residents expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the benevolent father of people who regards their misfortune as his greatest pain and spares nothing for alleviating it,"" KCNA claimed in another dispatch.

The move, however, drew scrutiny from Thae Yong-ho, a former senior North Korean diplomat who defected to South Korea and recently won a parliamentary seat. Thae, who was North Korea's deputy ambassador to the UK, is the senior-most official to defect and has provided a closer look at the regime's leadership.

""I think everyone's aware that Kim Jong Un's grain reserve reserves a special stockpile of grain that can only be used in the event of war,"" Thae said during a panel hosted by the Heritage Foundation think-tank.

Thae Yong Ho, former North Korean diplomat, who defected to South Korea in 2016, speaks to the media in Seoul, South Korea, February 19, 2019. Lee Jin-man/AP

""I think ... this means that North Korea's current food situation is really, really difficult; and the second, because of [these] coronavirus cases, North Korea is really in a difficult condition,"" Thae added. ""I think Kim Jong Un wants to send a kind of SOS signal to China, who is the only one who can send emergency aid to North Korea.""

Thae said that if North Korea needs to rely on China's aid, it may have to temper its provocations toward the US.

""In the second half of this year, if Kim Jong Un needs urgently the help from China, he cannot [conduct] big military provocations against America,"" Thae said.

North Korea has said it has the coronavirus under control and provided few details about its number of cases, claiming only one in late July. Pyongyang claimed that case was a North Korean defector who escaped to South Korea and then swam back after he became the subject of a sexual-assault investigation, though South Korea said he and others around him never tested positive.

Given North Korea's trade relationship and proximity with China, one expert said the regime's optimistic assessment is actually rather bleak.

""It reflects the perfect storm of economic stresses that North Korea is suffering right now,"" Bruce Klingner, a former chief of the CIA's branch in South Korea, told Insider. ""It was already suffering from being isolated from the world.""

North Korea's harsh measures in response to the coronavirus hurt its economic lifeline, Klingner said, adding that the struggle is likely exacerbated by the recent floods. From recalling its diplomats in Russia — who are suspected skirting sanctions by funneling cash to Pyongyang —to shutting down state-sponsored smuggling operations with China, the regime's moves were ""a one-two-three punch"" against its economy.

Despite some damage to crops going into the fall harvest, which is supposed to sustain the country through the year, North Korea also announced that it would not accept foreign assistance.

During a politburo meeting Thursday, Kim cited ""the spread of the worldwide malignant virus"" and announced the country will not ""allow any outside aid for the flood damage"" and enact stricter measures near the border.

""What they should do and what they will do are two very different things,"" Klingner said. ""Every country is struggling with COVID-19.""

""There's that conflicting necessity to both shut down against COVID-19 but also to open up for aid, or humanitarian and medical assistance,"" Klingner added. ""So the regime, like other countries, are going to struggle with how to balance those two conflicting objectives.""","Sat, 15 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.insider.com/5f35c919b4bb1c001df5337d?width=1200&format=jpeg,"['sign', 'koreas', 'pyongyang', 'thae', 'leader', 'feed', 'kim', 'korea', 'flooding', 'jong', 'private', 'tapping', 'grain', 'worrying', 'korean', 'north', 'food', 'south', 'reserve']",

Flash flood warnings were issued in parts of the Southland Tuesday afternoon, including for the Apple Fire burn scar area, as a thunderstorm moved through the region during an intense heat wave.

The first thunderstorm formed near Big Bear Lake around noon, according to the National Weather Service.

“Activity will continue to pick up over the next few hours in the mountains, and should gradually drift toward the Inland Empire later today,” the weather service tweeted.

The system moved into other parts of San Bernardino County, including Joshua Tree, where lightning sparked “numerous” vegetation fires, according to the county’s Fire Department. The largest blaze grew to about 150 acres before forward progress was halted.

In Los Angeles County, showers and isolated thunderstorms were initially detected in parts of the Antelope Valley shortly after 1 p.m. About an hour later, a thunderstorm began developing in the area, with activity reported “between Big Pines, Lake Los Angeles, Acton, and Palmdale,” according to NWS.

Around 3:45 p.m., additional storms formed east of the 5 Freeway near where the Lake Fire was burning in the Angeles National Forest, as well as in parts of northwest Ventura County.

A “strong” thunderstorm near Mount Pinos and south of Pine Mountain Club prompted NWS to issue a significant weather advisory late in the afternoon.

Forecasters warned the storms could bring dangerous lightning, gusty winds, brief intervals of heavy rain and even hail to the area.

Flash flood warnings have gone into effect in areas throughout Southern California, including for Oak Glen and Cherry Valley, potentially putting recent burn scarred areas from the recent Apple Fire at risk through late into the afternoon.

“Excessive rainfall over the burn scar will result in potentially deadly and destructive debris flows. The debris flow can consist of rock, mud, vegetation and other loose materials,” the weather service said.

The Apple Fire, which broke out on July 31, has burned about 52 square miles and is almost fully contained.

Hemet, San Jacinto, Valley Vista, Running Springs, Arrowbear Lake And Green Valley were among the areas under flash flood warnings during the afternoon.

Anyone who encounters flooding should immediately move to higher ground and avoid driving through floodwaters, forecasters advised.

Meanwhile, an excessive heat warning was in place throughout the region amid searing, triple-digit temperatures.

By 12:45 p.m., the heat index had already reached 119 degrees in Palm Springs, 111 degrees in Riverside and 109 degrees in Santa Ana, according to the weather service.

In San Diego County, the heat index values along the Interstate-15 corridor eclipsed 115 degrees by early afternoon, thanks to the humidity.

“These are remarkable numbers for inland San Diego County – feeling just as hot as the Coachella Valley,” NWS tweeted.","Tue, 18 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/storm-2.jpg?w=1280,"['hits', 'nws', 'near', 'including', 'warnings', 'issued', 'flash', 'flood', 'san', 'socal', 'county', 'valley', 'los', 'angeles', 'weather', 'summer', 'parts', 'thunderstorm']",

""Residents of the Artibonite region, stay alert, there will be flooding in the valley. The Red Alert is still in effect for the entire country,"" Alexis warned.



In Riviere Froide, in the southeastern Nippes Department, residents told VOA Creole they fear for their lives as the river threatens homes and businesses near its banks.

""We are in grave danger because when this river overflows it causes major problems. There are people who have children who need to evacuate but they don't have the resources to do that,"" a man who stood on the bank of the overflowing, muddy river told VOA. He urged the government to send help immediately.

Another male resident told VOA many of the homes on the bank of the river have multiple people living in them and that the river also swept away livestock.

""The river is a big threat to the people living near it (now),"" he said.

Video recorded by VOA Creole shows river waters sweeping away parts of makeshift, tin-roof homes. Some people are seen standing seemingly helpless on the front porch of their homes as the river creeps closer and closer. Other residents attempt to salvage property as people standing on the opposite side of the riverbank shout at them to watch out. In the background a woman screams.

ROME, Aug. 24 (Xinhua) -- Italy's northern Veneto region was reeling on Monday in the aftermath of a violent storm, with torrential rain and hail followed by a tornado that swept across several provinces and cities on Sunday, causing extensive damage to harvests and properties.

In the city of Verona, the tornado and the downpour uprooted trees, tore roofing off buildings, and submerged the city in hail and floods, as seen in photos and videos published by Corriere del Veneto, a local paper, and by MeteoWeb weather website.

The storm also uprooted fruit trees, tore down vineyards, destroyed greenhouses and harvests, and flooded animal stables in the Veneto countryside, causing ""millions of euros in damages,"" the National Confederation of Farmers (Coldiretti, in its Italian acronym) said in a statement on Monday.

Coldiretti said that ""the nets that were supposed to protect the fruit ready for harvest were devastated by the fury of the climate, which did not spare the grapes that were about to be picked.""

The farmers association pointed out that so far in August, there have been ""five hail and rain storms a day up and down the Italian peninsula, often destroying a whole year's worth of work in a few minutes.""

Also on Monday, Veneto Governor Luca Zaia said in a press conference that he has declared a state of emergency for the provinces and cities of Verona, Padova, Vicenza and Belluno, where the consequences of the storm have been ""devastating.""

The city of Verona, which was ""the epicenter"" of the devastation, ""is on its knees,"" Zaia said.

The National Fire Department tweeted that it carried out ""over 200 rescue operations"" on Sunday due to ""widespread flooding"" while on Monday, firefighters were engaged in ""over 300 interventions to combat damage caused by hail, torrential rains and wind"" in the Veneto provinces of Verona, Padova and Vicenza.

88,88,FL-2020-000182-CHN,North Korea’s Leader Had Big Economic Plans. He Admits They’ve Failed. - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/world/asia/north-korea-economy-coronavirus.html,"Mr. Kim held his major coming-out event as leader when he held the party congress in 2016, the first such meeting in 36 years. There, he adopted his ambitious five-year economic goals. The plan was for Mr. Kim to celebrate his achievement during the party’s 75th anniversary on Oct. 10 this year with pomp and spectacle.

But things have hardly transpired as Mr. Kim had hoped.

North Korea had already been struggling under the stranglehold of United Nations sanctions. Then, last week, the North Korean leader admitted that his nation was facing “two crises at the same time”: fighting the spread of the coronavirus and coping with extensive flood damage. But he ordered his country not to accept any international aid for fear that outside help might bring in Covid-19.

In his no-nonsense assessment during the party meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Kim said his country faced “unexpected and inevitable challenges” this year. He also critiqued the “achievements and shortcomings” of his own government, state news media reported.

When Mr. Kim took power after the death in 2011 of his father and predecessor, he vowed to ensure that his people, long suffering from multiple maladies, would “never have to tighten their belt again.” In 2016, when he adopted his economic plan, the North’s economy grew 3.9 percent, the highest since a devastating famine hit the country in the late 1990s, according to the estimates by the South’s central Bank of Korea.

The growth was largely the result of ramped-up exports of coal, iron ore, textiles and fisheries to China. But the United Nations Security Council banned such exports after the North rapidly expanded its weapons programs, testing three intercontinental ballistic missiles in 2017, as well as what it said was a hydrogen bomb.

As the sanctions tightened, the North’s economy shrank by 3.5 percent in 2017, according to the Bank of Korea. It contracted by 4.1 percent the following year, with its exports to China plummeting 86 percent.

North Korea’s economy recovered slightly last year, growing 0.4 percent, as Pyongyang invented ways of easing the pain of the sanctions, such as smuggling banned cargo across the Chinese border at night or between ships on the high seas. It also exported practically anything not banned by the sanctions: cheap watches assembled with Chinese components, artificial eyelashes, wigs, mannequins and soccer balls.","Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/20/world/20nkorea-1sub/20nkorea-1sub-facebookJumbo.jpg,"['plans', 'koreas', 'big', 'sanctions', 'exports', 'leader', 'kim', 'united', 'theyve', 'failed', 'economy', 'banned', 'mr', 'admits', 'north', 'country', 'party', 'plan', 'economic']", 
89,89,FL-2020-000182-CHN,Mao's China falsely claimed it had eradicated schistosomiasis – and it's still celebrating that 'success' in propaganda today - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/maos-china-falsely-claimed-it-had-eradicated-schistosomiasis-and-its-still-celebrating-that-success-in-propaganda-today-144464,"In early April, with much of the world under lockdown, China was already celebrating its purported victory in keeping the new coronavirus under control. In an effort to boost public morale, on April 2 the state-run Chinese Central Television, which acts as an ideological mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), re-aired a documentary about a Mao-era campaign against the disease schistosomiasis. The film, which was made in 2018, claimed the CCP’s leadership had successively eradicated the disease in China in the late 1950s, saving millions of lives.

Several blogs also recommended that people in Wuhan, the original epicentre of COVID-19, re-read Mao Zedong’s 1958 poem Sending off the plague God, which celebrated total eradication of schistosomiasis from Yujiang, a small county along the Yangtze in central China.

But contrary to China’s official claims that it had successfully eradicated schistosomiasis, this never occurred, a cover up I’ve investigated in a new book. By focusing on this ill-fated campaign in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, China revealed just how little the relationship between propaganda and public health has changed since the 1950s.

A ‘peasants’ disease

Also known as bilharzia or snail fever, schistosomiasis is a disease carried by a parasitic worm found in fresh water. It can stay in the body for years if not treated and be debilitating, causing organ failure leading to eventual death.

China’s anti-schistosomiasis campaign began in 1955 when Mao mounted a “socialist high tide” push to bring the socialist revolution to the Chinese countryside. The campaign was the centrepiece of the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) focus on public health, which became the touchstone for public health innovation globally during the cold war.

The CCP leadership singled out schistosomiasis because it was a “peasants” disease which affected those working in the paddy fields and resulted from the traditional way of life of farming communities living in rice-growing regions.

The goal was to eradicate schistosomiasis within seven years, by 1962. As schistosomiasis also afflicts people in many parts of the underdeveloped world, it was thought this would bring prestige to the country if the PRC could be the first to eradicate it.

My research drew on evidence from rarely seen party archives unearthed across eight impacted Chinese provinces and freshly collected oral testimonies from experts, local cadres and villagers who had participated in or were impacted by the campaign. I found that as soon as the campaign was set in motion, the authorities quickly learned that they really had little control over it.

In 1958, at the height of Mao’s Great Leap Forward, a utopian campaign to industrialise China, the PRC became the first country in the world to declare it had successfully eradicated the disease. But it hadn’t.

A grassroots health cadre from Jingzhou in Hubei province who was involved in the local implementation of the campaign told me:

We simply made up the figures. Officials from higher-ups knew it all along. To avoid getting into trouble or being sacked from office, they needed us to inflate or forge figures … It’s an open secret.

Damaging remedies

The CCP’s sense of urgency to control the disease, as with many other aspects involved in its centralisation policies, caused a fragmented and often contradictory local response.

With the advent of the Great Leap Forward in 1957 there was an even greater ideological demand to speed up eradication. Land reclamation and irrigation schemes were employed to bury and kill the snails – the vector that transmits the parasite. Such schemes not only proved extremely costly and wasteful, they also caused problems of water logging and water supply, contributing to severe flood and soil degradation that still haunts impact regions to this day.

In the end, the reclamation initiatives had to be abandoned. The subsequent switch to killing the snails using special pesticides further damaged the natural ecosystem, with long-lasting negative consequences on the environment.

This period of radical and rapid political change also saw people with the disease treated with higher doses of the toxic drug antimony tartrate, an internationally accepted intervention of the time known to control the infection in humans. Not only was this limited in its effectiveness, but my archival research shows the high doses of this toxic substance also claimed many lives.

Fiction versus reality

At the height of the Great Leap Forward, and in the aftermath of the subsequent famine, millions of new agricultural migrants and livestock were sent to the infected regions to help with agricultural production. Many were infected by schistosomiasis, while those who had been cured of the disease were reinfected. One report I found on local problems with the campaign said people protested that: “The leadership from higher up only cares about production, not human life.”

In the meantime, famine-related swelling, gynaecological problems and child malnutrition became even more widespread in the countryside. Unable to cope with the crisis, the PRC’s rural health system literally collapsed and ever more authoritarian and centralised methods came into play.

With increasing desperation, officials saw the promised goal of schistosomiasis eradication and the rural utopia it was to help create slipping away. Yet all this was quickly erased and forgotten. As well as Mao’s poem, a 1962 feature film called A Withered Tree Meets Spring immortalised the success of the campaign. These fictions were needed at the time to confront the brutal realities of the disease and the famine, and their devastating impact on people’s health.

Impelled to catch up with Yujiang – the first place to declare eradication in 1958 – 167 counties and municipalities hurried to declare near eradication in the following months. All turned out to be false, and there was a substantial cover up, as my study shows. Today, schistosomaisis remains endemic in many of these places, although it ceased to be a problem in some due to urbanisation, the subsequent depopulation of rural regions and the modernisation of agriculture.

China’s official narrative remains that the disease was eradicated but has returned – something it blames on political opponents who sabotaged the campaign. The latest official data shows 54,454 infections in 2016, with 69.4 million people at risk. In 2017, China’s National Health Commission issued new guidance which set the goal to control – not eradicate – the disease by 2020.

Uses of propaganda

In post-Mao China, mass media propaganda about the state’s success in improving people’s health concealed the reality of poor and mismanaged healthcare. In 2020, the same propaganda message has been used during the COVID-19 epidemic too.

In her seminal study on totalitarianism, the philosopher Hannah Arendt wrote that: “What convinces masses are not facts, and not even invented facts, but only the consistency of the system of which they are presumably part.”

China’s decision to air the documentary in April was a calculated one. By identifying with the victory narrative of the Maoist anti-schistosomiasis campaign, the otherwise hapless and frightened people in a totalitarian state could at least feel proud for being a member of a heroic nation that they believed was the first and only country to have eradicated schistosomiasis. By placing the struggle against COVID-19 within a victory narrative of improving health, the Chinese government continues to create a false sense of security and cohesion – one they require to ensure the stability needed to remain in power.","Sat, 22 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/353646/original/file-20200819-25336-1x38b09.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C169%2C660%2C329&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['eradication', 'chinese', 'health', 'public', 'campaign', 'china', 'today', 'control', 'maos', 'eradicated', 'claimed', 'propaganda', 'success', 'celebrating', 'falsely', 'schistosomiasis', 'disease']",

BEIJING — Once on the brink of bankruptcy, one of China's largest electric car makers is pressing ahead with plans to expand to Europe and beyond.

Nio, which listed in the U.S. nearly two years ago, is arguably China's closest competitor to Tesla. Shares of the Chinese start-up plunged more than 80% from their highs last year as financial troubles mounted. Since its public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, several executives, including one of the founders and leaders for Nio in the U.K. and the U.S., have left, in addition to many layoffs.

Then in the middle of the coronavirus outbreak, Nio announced funding talks with the government of Hefei city in southeastern China that later resulted in a lifeline of 7 billion yuan ($1 billion) from investors, including state-backed entities. Meanwhile, vehicle deliveries hit a record 3,740 in June and topped 10,000 for the second quarter overall, according to Nio. Shares are up more than 240% so far this year.

As of Wednesday morning, northern Vinh Phuc Province had reported two fatalities while Lao Cai, Son La, Lai Chau and Thai Nguyen claimed one death each, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control.

The committee said at least four others were injured.

Since last Sunday, northern provinces have been battered by torrential downpours due to the influence of a tropical convergence zone and effects from tropical storm Higos, which made landfall on China’s southern coast Wednesday morning.

Lao Cai, Yen Bai, Ha Giang and Tuyen Giang experienced heavy rainfall of up to 300 mm each downpour while Quang Ninh, home to world famous Ha Long Bay, and Hai Phong City received rainfall of between 200 and 350 mm each time. Levels of 180 mm a day are considered heavy.

At least 334 houses in the localities were damaged. Over 550 ha of rice and other crops were inundated while landslides blocked many roads leading to northern mountainous provinces like Lai Chau and Lao Cai, home to popular Sa Pa Town.

Weather forecasters warned northern provinces should expect heavy downpours with rainfall of between 100 and 250 mm from Thursday to Saturday due to the impacts of Higos.

Tran Quang Hoai, vice head of the committee, asked northern authorities to deploy rescue teams and evacuate residents in flood-prone areas.

Higos is the fourth storm formed in the East Sea this year.

Beijing (AFP)

Residents in China's northwestern Xinjiang region have complained on social media about the harsh coronavirus lockdown measures in the sensitive region after a local outbreak.

China -- where the disease first emerged -- had largely brought domestic transmission under control through lockdowns, travel restrictions and testing, but sporadic regional outbreaks have emerged.

A new cluster in Xinjiang's capital Urumqi in mid-July prompted fresh restrictions. A total of 902 cases have been officially reported in the outbreak.

Officials said earlier this month that they had ""effectively contained"" the spread of the Urumqi cluster, and there have been no new cases reported in the last eight days.

But hundreds of local residents flooded local social media forums in recent days to complain about harsh conditions, including many being forced to stay home.

After some of these comments were removed -- China's internet is heavily censored -- users tried to flood local forums on the Twitter-like Weibo platform in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.

Social media users shared photos of front doors sealed with steel crowbars, and locks installed by community workers.

""Why can't prefectures with no cases remove the lockdown? Why do you need to lock down the whole of Xinjiang?"" read one comment on Weibo, which received thousands of likes.

""Doors have been sealed, this has brought huge inconvenience to workers and people's lives. Prices of daily items have risen... many things I buy are expired.""

Little information has been released by the authorities about the Xinjiang cluster.

Other local governments in China have provided information on patients' movements in granular detail.

Photos circulating on Weibo and WeChat also purportedly showed people chained to community gates with handcuffs, reportedly as a punishment for leaving their homes.

Some residents also wrote that they were forced by authorities to take Chinese medicine daily, and were required to film themselves doing so.

One video from Saturday purportedly showed dozens of high-rise residents in Urumqi yelling from their windows in despair.

Stranded migrant workers, university students, business travellers and tourists have also complained about not being able to leave Xinjiang.

""I have even taken three nucleic acid tests... but community workers won't let me leave,"" one user wrote on a message board run by the state-run People's Daily.

At a press conference last Thursday, local health officials in Xinjiang said that the epidemic situation remains ""complicated and severe"".

Around half of Xinjiang's more than 21 million people are ethnic Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims, many of whom complain of decades of political and religious oppression by China's ruling Communist Party, which the government denies.

Activists have accused the Chinese government of incarcerating about one million Uighurs and other Turkic people in Xinjiang camps. Beijing has described them as vocational training centres to counter Islamic radicalism.

98,98,FL-2020-000182-CHN,Expert violin-makers in Italy spend 3 months making a single instrument — but cheap violins from China are flooding the market - Business Insider South Africa,https://www.businessinsider.co.za/violins-italian-stradivarius-cremona-chinese-2020-8,"Cremona, Italy, is the world capital of violin-making, and is the birthplace of the famous Stradivarius violins that can be worth millions of dollars.

But business in Cremona is under threat from a flood of Chinese manufacturers that churn out much cheaper instruments in larger quantities.

The small market for instruments of the highest quality also forces workshops in Cremona to compete against each other alongside foreign competitors.

For more stories go to www.BusinessInsider.co.za.

The city of Cremona, Italy, is home to about 160 workshops, and is the birthplace of the famous Stradivarius violins that can be worth millions of dollars.

Artisans known as luthiers, or in Italian, ""liutai,"" have been making some of the best violins, cellos, and other stringed instruments here since the 16th century.

But business in the capital of violin-making may be under threat, facing competition from Chinese manufacturers that churn out much cheaper instruments in larger quantities.

Bénédicte Friedmann, a French luthier living in Cremona, says that the difference between a Chinese violin and a Cremonese one is that ""the Chinese ones are the combination of several hands, whereas the artisan violins made in Cremona have the luthier's personality within them.""

These instruments have flooded the market as China makes and sells significantly more than any other country, affecting the global trade worth $147 million, according to data from the International Trade Centre.

In 2019, China made more than 1.5 million of the approximately 2 million violins and stringed instruments exported worldwide. Italy, on the other hand, exported only 6,727. Luthiers in Cremona focus on quality instruments for master musicians over mass-produced ones for beginners, and can take up to three months to create a single violin.

It's this artistry that keeps the prices high. Giorgio Grisales, the president of the local consortium of violin-makers, says master-level instruments can start at $28,000.

But there's a pretty small market for pieces of this quality and price point, which leads the city's workshops to compete against themselves alongside foreign ones.

One of the oldest luthiers in Cremona, Stefano Conia, says his life would be over without the craft.

""I come to the workshop every day. It is an antibiotic for old age,"" Conia said.

Cremona's luthiers were also hard hit this year when northern Italy became an early epicenter of Covid-19 cases. Besides canceled orders, there were few musicians needing instruments for rare live performances, and even fewer tourists visiting the workshops.

But as Italy recovers and life in Cremona adjusts to a new normal, Grisales, who's been making instruments for more than 30 years, has faith that the art will go on.

""The tradition of making violins will survive if whoever holds the reins of the economy realises that Cremona and all of Italy is a country of craftsmen,"" he said.","Sun, 16 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7376/133d89862ba54187a3bdeba750af7b9b.jpg,"['luthiers', 'violins', 'italy', 'chinese', 'million', 'cremona', 'quality', 'making', 'worth', 'instruments', 'workshops', 'flooding', 'instrument', 'spend', 'market', 'months', 'violinmakers', 'single']",
