The city in Sichuan province, hit by a magnitude-7 earthquake on April 20, is preparing for heavy rain from May to September. Loose debris will increase the danger of surging floodwaters and buildings already structurally weakened could topple.

The China Meteorological Administration and local authorities are also stepping up efforts to combat the spread of disease through tainted floodwater and instructing people how to cope, Chen Zhenlin, spokesman for the administration, said on Sunday.

The quake killed nearly 200 people.

""Ya'an is one of the wettest places in the country with an average rainfall exceeding 1,200 millimeters from May to September, almost triple the national average,"" he said.

The meteorological administration has experience of dealing with rainstorms in quake-hit areas. It set up lightning protection facilities at relocation sites after the Wenchuan quake in 2008 and it is doing the same in Ya'an, Chen said.

According to Tang Chuan, from the geo-hazard department at Chengdu University of Technology, Wenchuan experienced a number of landslides during the flood season and Ya'an, with traditionally heavier rainfall, is more likely to be hit.

Donation

The Red Cross Society of China raised 566 million yuan ($92 million) as of April 27, almost half the total national fund raising of 1.37 billion yuan.

Most of the donations to the Red Cross came from private enterprises and individuals, it said.

Zhao Baige, executive vice-president of the organization, said she was grateful that the public still has confidence in the Red Cross despite concerns over fundraising.

The organization is releasing information on how donations will be spent, she said.

People and organizations from all walks of life are lending a helping hand.

Three trucks loaded with relief materials, including tents, rain gear, electric generators and food, have arrived in Lushan county, the quake's epicenter.

The materials were donated by the EMBA association of Sichuan University's business school.","Tue, 30 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",,"['season', 'meteorological', 'sichuan', 'red', 'administration', 'earthquake', 'rain', 'cross', 'chinaorgcn', 'yaan', 'nears', 'braces', 'city', 'china', 'flooding']", 
1,1,FL-2013-000054-CHN,China is forced to do something about its laughable trade data - Quartz,https://qz.com/81573/china-vows-to-do-something-about-chinas-laughable-trade-data/,"Even during the best of times, observers take China’s economic data with a healthy pinch of salt.

But in recent months, Chinese import and export numbers hit something of a high-water mark for implausibility. For instance, according to the most recent monthly numbers, China exports almost twice as much to Hong Kong—a financial citadel of around 7 million people—as it does to the US, the world’s largest economy and a voracious consumer of Chinese manufactured goods. Seriously, look.

Obviously, this isn’t right. The one theory is that the spike in “exports” to Hong Kong is the aggregate result of widespread fraud among exporters, who are enabling foreign investors to sidestep government attempts to control the flood of cash into China’s fast-growing economy. Apparently the Chinese government thinks that’s a possibility.

This weekend China’s chief currency trading regulator, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), announced it plans to clamp down on capital inflows, including increased monitoring of cargo and cash flow data to make sure the numbers match. The yuan weakened in response, as some of that inflow of cash from abroad has doubtlessly been responsible for the heavily controlled currency hitting all time highs recently.

Now a good question might be: Why does China want to keep such tight control over how much investment cash gets into the country? Isn’t incoming capital a good thing for investment and development? Not always. There’s a rich history of hot developing markets sucking in way to0 much cash, too quickly, pushing asset prices up sharply and then seeing those asset prices collapse once those flows of cash reverse. That’s the short version of the East Asian crisis of the late 1990s. China has tried to prevent a replay. However, keeping investor money out of a fast-growing economy—especially when interest rates, and by extension yields on investment are near all-time lows—is a challenge. “If money wants to get in, it’ll get in,” an unnamed trader told Market News International. And once it gets in where might that cash go? A good part of it likely ends up in China’s burgeoning financial black market, something financial analysts are increasingly concerned about.","Mon, 06 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/quartz-og.jpg,"['chinese', 'cash', 'thats', 'laughable', 'recent', 'forced', 'chinas', 'numbers', 'investment', 'good', 'financial', 'china', 'trade', 'data']",

The whole of Shanghai, including the most heavily-populated areas, could be overwhelmed by flooding,"" Cheng Heqin, an expert from the Institute of Estuarine and Coastal Research at the university and a member of the research team, told the Global Times.According to the research by Cheng and her team, the sea level around Shanghai will rise by 5 to 8 millimeters per year over the next 20 years, which is above the world average.""Shanghai is safe now only because it is protected by sea defense systems. But the average ground level is already below the average high tidal level. This means if it weren't for the flood prevention walls, the city would already be beneath water at times of peak tides,"" she said, adding that the city has to continuously build and upgrade flood defenses.The rising sea level also poses a threat to the water supply for the city's more than 23 million residents, the research found.""More than 70 percent of Shanghai's water supply comes from the Qingcaosha Reservoir. The rise in sea level will reduce the amount of time per year when we can draw fresh water from there. This will be a big problem in securing residents' daily water needs,"" Cheng said.The rising sea level means that by 2030, freshwater will not be available from the Qingcaosha Reservoir for an average 2.11 days per year. For Shanghai's other two reservoirs - Chenhang and the Dongfengxisha - the average will be 0.54 and 0.15 days per year respectively, according to the research.The research team has submitted a plan for dealing with the problem to government authorities, which includes suggestions for ensuring the maintenance of the fresh water supply.""Since Shanghai is at the end of the Yangtze River, its supply of water is severely influenced by the water projects along the upper reaches. The national authorities should step in and ensure reasonable distribution of water resources along the river,"" Cheng said.The various water projects upriver, including the Three Gorges Dam, the Gezhou Dam, and the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, contribute to the decrease of the water volume in the lower reaches, and a consequent rise in salinity, which endangers the local water reservoirs, she said.","Sat, 27 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.globaltimes.cn/images/gfavicon.ico,"['rising', 'research', 'rise', 'shanghai', 'danger', 'sea', 'team', 'pose', 'level', 'water', 'city', 'levels', 'average', 'cheng']",

5,5,FL-2013-000054-CHN,New Thing: Chinese Web Users Love Petitioning the White House - The Atlantic,https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/05/new-thing-chinese-web-users-love-petitioning-the-white-house/275648/,"None of the more recent petitions has approached the threshold requiring a government response, and Chinese Web users are likely aware of the limits to the White House's power. But these spontaneous online movements are part of a pattern, where a small but enthusiastic group of Chinese Web users occasionally erupt in digital psuedo-democracy and pseudo-diplomacy.

In early February of 2012, when China's so-called Great Firewall temporarily lifted its block on Google Plus, Chinese Web users took advantage of the brief reprieve to flood President Obama's re-election page with comments. More recently, in mid-March of this year, a well-known provocateur tweeted the results of an imaginary election on Sina Weibo, a micro-blogging service. Hundreds of users replied in surprisingly serious tones, with one estimating that true elections would not be held until 2033, another saying it would be ""a thousand years"" hence. That provocateur's tweet, and the comments to it, were deleted in less than 24 hours.

One cannot interpret these instantiated movements as representing China writ large. Given the massive size of China's social Web, even a tiny but determined minority can quickly make its presence felt on the American Internet. Even within these comparatively small groups, motivations vary; some White House petitioners wrote in rage, others in jest.

Nonetheless, it's a valuable reminder of American soft power in the digital age. In China, the Letters and Visits Office is charged with accepting petitions from aggrieved citizens. But often, thugs known as jiefang intercept would-be petitioners from outside of Beijing, sometimes before they can even board a train headed for the capital. The contrast with the White House's approach is jarring. As one Weibo user commented, ""Going to the gates of the White House to petition may or may not be useful, but I know that going there to petition won't get you in trouble."" Another wrote, ""Too funny; but after I laughed, I felt like I'd never be able to slake my thirst.""

And this particular cross-cultural moment may be a bit longer in the tooth. Censors who descended to block the name ""Zhu Ling"" have already backed off again, and it may be politically difficult to manage a redux. For its part, the White House petition site, which does not currently require petitioners to be U.S. citizens, may be readying a response to the Zhu Ling petition. It also remains unblocked by the Great Firewall within China.

Most importantly, moments such as these hint, however obliquely, at the latent promise of a truly connected Internet, rather than the siloed version that effectively exists today. China's incarnation has often been described as an ""Intranet,"" one encircled by a Great Firewall that blocks key Western social platforms and beset internally by thousands of censors that keep domestic online content from spurring on-the-ground collective action. The U.S. Internet is a free one, but barriers of language and culture nonetheless shape user habits, tilting the playing field sharply toward domestic content.

As a result, Americans and Chinese often seem to inhabit parallel online universes, despite the Internet's manifest potential to connect them. When the twain collide or merely brush shoulders, the result can be refreshing, even tantalizing.","Tue, 07 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/static/b/theatlantic/img/lacroix-default-thumbnail.png,"['chinese', 'house', 'petition', 'petitioners', 'internet', 'love', 'online', 'thing', 'white', 'users', 'great', 'petitioning', 'web']", 
6,6,FL-2013-000054-CHN,Taming the Yangtze - Travel Weekly,https://www.travelweekly.com/River-Cruising/Taming-the-Yangtze,"In 2009, the Yangtze River's massive Three Gorges Dam project was completed. That same year, cruising along the Yangtze saw a dramatic downturn, and the industry has been working to reinvent itself ever since.

The result has been a shift from a high-volume product to a higher-quality product, simultaneous with an ongoing effort to combat negative perceptions about the dam and its impact.

""I think it's more a question of how the market is evolving than where it's growing,"" said Larry Greenman, manager of public relations and customer service for Victoria Cruises, one of the dominant river cruise players on the Yangtze. ""On the one hand, travel to China has become increasingly affordable since the economic downturn peaked in 2009.""

In addition, he said, ""As the Yangtze is now considered a must-see segment of any introductory China vacation, we do anticipate that numbers will continue to grow, but the larger development has been the increased demand for luxury amenities beyond the typical offering.""

Victoria Cruises still hasn't seen its numbers from the North American market return to 2008 levels, when 45,000 Americans took a Yangtze River cruise with the company.

In 2009, that number dropped to 15,000 and has been slowly recovering, reaching 30,000 last year. But that is not a result of a recovering U.S. market. Victoria said that increases in passengers from Europe and Australia have been making up for decreases from North America.

In the meantime, Victoria has been pouring money into its fleet of seven ships to meet the new demand for luxury amenities. The Woodside, N.Y.-based line finished a two-year, $10 million overhaul of five ships in 2012 and invested another $4.5 million in upgrading the 270-passenger Victoria Anna, which it unveiled earlier this year.

Anna's sister ship, the Victoria Katarina, which was originally slated for a renovation alongside the Anna, will undergo a similar redo next winter, Victoria Cruises has said.

A major component of Victoria's refurb program has been the addition of the Executive Amenities Program, a premium option that includes an executive lounge; concierge service; upgraded cabin categories; an exclusive dining room; private, small-group shore excursions; happy hour; complimentary Internet access; and complimentary laundry and shoe shine services, plus reserved seating for evening entertainment.

""It is quickly becoming the new standard for North American travelers,"" Greenman said of the Executive Amenities Program, adding that Victoria's U.S. tour operator partners often buy into this upgraded program.

Indeed, the entire Yangtze River cruise market appears to be stepping up its game as it strives to court consumers who are demanding something more in line with the upscale European river cruising experience.

This year, at least two Chinese companies are launching newbuilds to offer this more luxurious form of travel on the Yangtze.

In 2013, President Cruises, a Chinese company, is introducing two 462-passenger sister ships: the President 7 and President 8. The new ships feature a heated indoor pool, a putting green, a cinema and conference facilities. They also have 216 cabins at 260 square feet each, 12 executive suites at 376 square feet each and two 742-square-foot presidential suites.

Similarly, Century Cruises is making a big splash with its two new 398-passenger vessels, the Century Paragon and Century Legend, which attempt to raise the standard of river cruising on the Yangtze. (View a slideshow from the recent inaugural sailing of the Century Paragon by clicking here or on the photos.)

The Century ships boast a 2,153-square-foot indoor pool area and a 150-passenger movie theater. And, like the Victoria vessels, for those clients who maybe would like a little more exclusivity and detachment from the other passengers, there are two dedicated executive levels with an exclusive a la carte restaurant, reception area, bar and sun deck.

Century invested $24 million each in the Paragon and the Legend, and the company's efforts appear to be paying off. Avalon Waterways and Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection have already secured charter agreements on the new Century ships. And Century has about 20,000 U.S. passengers currently booked for 2013. In 2012, the company booked 38,000 U.S. passengers.

""Overall, our business to China is up over 30%,"" said Uniworld President Guy Young, who attended the Century Paragon's christening ceremony in March. ""That's mainly because of the improved program, the new ship, and we've increased our marketing a lot to the destination.""

Uniworld has contracted its own deck on the new Century ships, and Uniworld passengers will have access to the executive-level amenities.

And while the Yangtze accounts for only about 5% of Uniworld's overall business, Young said that as it continues to rebound, it remains an important market for river cruise clients seeking new destinations. He said Uniworld's goal is to double the China business in the next two to three years.

""And we think with the new ships we can do it,"" Young said.

Viking River Cruises has been selling the Yangtze since 2004, always chartering ships from Century. For 2013, Viking is chartering the 264-passenger Century Emerald, built in 2010, and Viking reports that bookings are up 15% over 2012.

""The ships have gotten progressively better,"" said Richard Marnell, senior vice president of marketing for Viking, about the ever-improving hardware in China.

The dam's pros and cons

One of the challenges river cruise lines on the Yangtze River have faced in the aftermath of the completion of the Three Gorges Dam project has been combating negative perceptions about the flood waters' impact on the scenery, the experience and on Chinese society.

An engineering marvel, the dam is as controversial as it is impressive. At 7,660 feet long and 600 feet high, it is the world's largest hydroelectric plant. But its installment caused hundreds of square miles of land along the river to be flooded, submerging entire cities and displacing 1.3 million people.

In addition, the flooding changed the landscape. The water level, for example, is higher up on the famous Three Gorges, which means they no longer soar as high above the passing ships as they did in the past.

But river cruise operators on the Yangtze insist that the benefits for navigation and tourism outweigh the drawbacks.

""The increased water level allows us to navigate the river more efficiently with fewer service interruptions and a multitude of new options for shore excursions,"" Greenman said.

Greenman noted that with higher waters, Victoria vessels can now travel farther along some of the Yangtze's tributaries. Additionally, prior to the dam, Victoria did not take passengers to White Emperor City, a site on Baidi Mountain, because the journey involved climbing many steps and was deemed too difficult for passengers. But now the company stops there because the higher water has resulted in fewer steps to climb.

In fact, for many tourists, the dam and all the intrigue surrounding it have themselves become part of the attraction of cruising the Yangtze.

""While the dam has inundated some areas we previously visited, it has allowed us to explore more of the lesser Three Gorges, for example,"" Marnell said. ""Going through the dam is still one of the most thrilling experiences on the cruise.""

A defining feature of the dam is a five-step ship lock that carries vessels 370 feet up or down through the graduated locks. It takes about two hours and 40 minutes to pass through the lock system. There is also a 370-foot-high shiplift that can carry 3,000-ton vessels in about 30 minutes.

Cruising the Yangtze today is as much about witnessing this engineering feat and about visiting the cities that have cropped up along the newly defined riverbanks as it is about trying to see the Yangtze of Chinese legend.

Greenman said the dam amplified the contrast between the ancient and the modern.

""While the Yangtze River retains much of the traditional scenic beauty of days past,"" he said, ""we now have pockets of development which provide an interesting contrast between the simple life that is still very much a part of China's majestic countryside and the modernization which is taking place in the larger cities.""

The Yangtze's future

Visitors will have to decide for themselves whether the changes the river is undergoing are for better or worse, but operators that sell the river are still pushing to continue to improve and diversify the experience for passengers.

And the passengers themselves are becoming more diverse. River cruise lines are seeing growing interest in the Yangtze cruise experience from China's burgeoning domestic travel market. So, as the lines continue to evolve their product, they are also looking for ways to balance a mix of languages and cultures onboard their vessels.

The ""Chinese domestic market is going up for sure, especially in the past three years,"" Richard Xie, director of marketing and sales for Century, wrote in an email.

Victoria, too, is having to find a balance between East and West.

""While Victoria Cruises' Yangtze River experience was initially created with the Western market in mind, we've recently taken on a larger share of Chinese nationals who were able to explore their own country's heritage for the first time as a result of China's growing middle class,"" a Victoria representative stated in an email.

According to Victoria, at the height of the global economic crisis, more than 50% of passengers aboard its Yangtze River vessels were Chinese. Though the ratio has shifted back considerably since then, Victoria, along with other Yangtze operators such as Century, are having to learn how to make their product work for a melting-pot clientele. For one thing, the language differences have resulted in different shore excursion groups for passengers from different origin markets. And all announcements must be made in English and Chinese.

On the other hand, the Victoria representative said, ""We found that the introduction of Chinese passengers actually added to the authenticity of the experience. Many of our Western passengers enjoyed meeting and mingling with their Chinese counterparts.""

Additionally, companies on the Yangtze are clearly looking for more ways to diversify their offerings and to sell new and different options along the river to passengers, irrespective of origin.

""We have made the program somewhat more flexible to allow people more choices,"" Marnell said, adding that Viking has recently created a Shanghai extension and has a popular Tibet itinerary that passengers can tack on to a river cruise.

Victoria Cruises recently offered passengers the opportunity to explore a new tributary of the Yangtze, Shennong Stream, which is flanked by cliffs that passengers weave between on traditional sampans.

Marnell said, ""For 2014, we are working on creating more experiences that show our guests the real China and provide privileged-access visits to such highlights as the Xian warriors and the Forbidden City. Evening visits in Beijing and Shanghai will show our guests places beyond the obvious, such as the night market in Shanghai and the Houhai Lake area of Beijing.""

But as the companies push to steadily improve the product, both onboard and on shore, one thing that remains a logistical challenge and that is beyond the control of the lines is the condition of the docks. They vary significantly from one port to the next, and they are rarely on par with the increasingly high quality of the cruising experience itself.

""On the Yangtze River, the pier conditions need to improve,"" said Century Cruises President Peng Jian Hu.

Peng said that until recently, the Chinese government did not pay much attention to tourism improvement projects. But Peng, who is a member of the Chongqing region's local congress, said he has submitted a proposal to improve the piers, and his proposal is finally finding some traction within the local government.

""So, the Yangtze River will be better and better in the future,"" he said confidently. ""I believe more people will want to come. This is a big market.""

7,7,FL-2013-000054-CHN,Murong Xuecun on China's 'Crappy Freedom' - The Atlantic,https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/05/murong-xuecun-on-chinas-crappy-freedom/275527/,"Since the publication of his debut novel Leave me Alone: A Novel of Chengdu, Murong Xuecun (real name: Hao Qun) has emerged as one of China's brightest literary stars as well as a trenchant critic of Chinese censorship. In this essay, adapted from PEN International's new report Creativity and Constraint in Today's China and translated from Chinese by Scott Savitt, Murong discusses how censorship penetrates all levels of Chinese society.

If you're a writer and want to write a novel about life in modern China, you must steer clear of the following periods: the great famine from 1959 to 1962, the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, and the Tiananmen incident of 1989. Otherwise, you will find it difficult to get your book published.

If you're an editor or a reporter, you must know which events can be reported, which can be reported with some caution, and which absolutely cannot be reported; otherwise you're likely to be removed from your position, or even fired.

Every day propaganda departments issue all kinds of orders at their meetings, notifying people which words must not be mentioned, which must be blocked. Over the decades, these bans have never been withdrawn; they've piled high enough to become a new Himalayas.

Sitting on the towering summit of this mountain, our government's spokesperson has announced many times that the Chinese people enjoy extensive freedom of speech. Sitting at the foot of this mountain, the kind-hearted people can interpret that this way: for those events that can be reported, we enjoy real freedom; for those events that need to be reported with caution, we enjoy cautious freedom, for those events that are not allowed to be reported, we enjoy the freedom of no knowledge.

In 1931, the magazine Middle School Students asked Lu Xun what he would say if he had a chance to talk with one of its readers.

Lu Xun answered that he would tell the student, ""Let me ask you: do we have freedom of speech? If the answer is no, don't blame me for not saying anything. If I must say something, I would say that the first step is to fight for freedom of speech.""

81 years after Lu Xun's death, his works have been deleted from textbooks and the mission he passed on to future generations has yet to be accomplished. Generations of Chinese have fallen on this narrow and thorny road -- but when they look back, they realize they haven't walked far. When we open our mouths and talk what we're fighting for is still the very right to speak.

The free world has all kinds of wonders, the unfree world has all kinds of wonderful shortages of freedom.

When we look deep into China's climate for free expression, we see a very complex situation. Every city, every publishing house, and every editor has its own standards. The same article that can be published in Guangzhou may be banned in Shenzhen, and may be published in Beijing only after revision. The same book that Editor A might publish might be considered a dangerous item by Editor B.

All media and publishing houses are institutions of the government. While their employees enjoy the rank, treatment, and welfare provided by the government, they must at the same time obey the government, which includes prior censorship and the cruel settling of scores afterwards. The strategy of the propaganda department to control the media is ""Don't kill them. Let them live in fear"".

The free world has all kinds of wonders, the unfree world has all kinds of wonderful shortages of freedom.

Under such tremendous pressure, each and every media worker must assume the responsibility of a ""speech censorship officer"" who must make sure that every article that leaves his hand is harmless, free of being reactionary, free of pornography, free of sounding gloomy and decadent, and free of having any negative impact, or they will be responsible for some extremely serious consequences later. Some retired senior officials even volunteer to participate in this great cause of censorship. As soon as they find some banned terms, they pick up the phone and report to the government. They never consider that what they do is shameful. On the contrary, they are filled with a sense of justice, believing that they are defending their motherland.

In the past decade or so, the condition of freedom of speech in China has improved remarkably. But if any credit is due the government, it's due to its powerlessness.

In the Internet age, the Chinese government learns new technology and techniques every day. It has set up a thesaurus for sensitive words, adopted the most advanced firewall technology, and hired a huge number of anonymous people to defend it. It has blocked numerous foreign websites, including Facebook, Google, and Twitter. It has purged websites in the names of sweeping pornography and attacking rumors. Not long ago the comment function on the most influential Sina and QQ microblogs were shut down.

But while these means are very powerful and frightening, the government appears powerless when faced with the even more powerful Internet technology. Like an old, broken lawn mower, every time it cuts a weed's leaf, several new leaves grow.

In the gap between technology and regulatory instruments, the Chinese people are finally able to hear some free words and to read some true facts that the government has not yet had time to block. The high-speed train accident, the Wukan anti-government protests, the Chen Guangcheng incident, and many other incidents and events all set off huge waves on the Internet before a ban was imposed. More and more people joined in to make comments and publicize facts online, on blogs and microblogs.

It reminds me of what an ancient Chinese wise man said: Blocked words are like a flood: they will one day make the dam collapse.

You can't imagine how much wisdom and energy the Chinese people have to expend on their choice of words. On the Internet, people call Falun Gong ""wheel"". The year 1989 has become ""the year before 1990"" June 4 is now ""May 35"", tank is called ""tractor"". Deputy mayor Wang Lijun, who recently caused a sensation, is cleverly called ""head nurse Wang Lijuan"".

Speakers and listeners understand these words: censors pretend not to understand them. In this way, a harmonious society comes into being.

On April 22, 2011, a Chongqing netizen named Fang Hong passed a joke online: When Bo Xilai asked Wang Lijun to eat his shit, Wang Lijun asked the procurator to eat it, who then asked Li Zhuang to eat it. Li Zhuang said: whoever shit it should eat it.

Two days later, Fang Hong was arrested by the Chongqing police and was sentenced to one year of re-education through labor.

Shanghai had no newspapers until it was opened to the outside world in the mid-19th century when foreigners published the first English-language newspaper here. The history of newspapers in the city reflects the history of the country and the city itself. The first few foreign newspapers began a flood of information broadsheets and tabloids throughout the country. Just before the People's Republic of China was founded, there were some 4,000 newspapers being published in China - more than 1,800 in Shanghai.



As invading countries turned Shanghai into the country's largest and most profitable colony in the 19th century, the foreigners in the vanguard needed newspapers to serve themselves and help inform and assimilate the Chinese. News agencies were set up and at the same time China's progressive intellectuals and revolutionaries used newspapers to change the way of thinking.



Information demand



In 1849, Shanghai overtook Guangzhou as China's premier port and was the fourth largest port in Asia. With trade came a demand for information. Large manufacturers and stores sent representatives abroad to collect information on innovations and trends. More people flooded into Shanghai looking for opportunities. They became in turn the readers and the sources for the newspapers.



Before the first foreign newspaper appeared in Shanghai, information was delivered by government bulletins but these were not always available to the general public. The Chinese government tightly controlled public opinion and anyone who was found publishing one of the clandestine handwritten newspapers that occasionally appeared could face jail or even beheading. Information was passed around by word of mouth.



Then the city newspapers began to blossom. Between 1865 and 1895, Shanghai saw 41 new foreign-language newspapers and 45 Chinese newspapers hit the streets. Most were published by foreigners.



In 1850, seven years after Shanghai opened its port, the city's first real newspaper was launched. Henry Shearman, a British auctioneer printed the first edition of the North China Herald on August 3. The Herald served the 100 or so British residents of Shanghai at that time. It was a four-page broadsheet published every Saturday. The front page was dedicated to news from Britain, especially news of the royal family, and advertisements for shops, insurance, real estate, auctions and banks in Shanghai. The second page contained opinion pieces and the third and fourth pages contained information about shipping, ports and trade. This was where details of the ships carrying opium that docked at the port could be found.



The North China Herald had similar content to a modern newspaper with advertisements and gossip alongside news and information. Although it was designed to meet the specific needs of the British in the city, it proved a foundation for Chinese newspapers.



In 1859, the Herald was authorized by the British consulate in Shanghai to publish official British government notices and was regarded as the official British organ for the region.

Breaking news



In 1861 the North China Herald's manager Charles Spencer Compton, a professional British newspaperman, established the city's first proper Chinese newspaper, the Chinese Shipping List and Advertisers, which provided all kinds of trade information and advertisements in Chinese. It was the first newspaper to be printed on both sides and the first Chinese newspaper to use headlines in its design.



In 1864, the daily edition of the North China Herald was launched, called the North China Daily News. And the Herald became a weekend edition. The North China Daily News focused more on news and sent reporters to remote areas in China. It also featured more opinion pieces on the relationships between China and other countries. The paper used missionaries to collect news and also signed a contract with Reuters for international news. It staunchly promoted British and American interests and was the most influential and longest-running English-language newspaper in Shanghai. It closed in March 1951 after a century of publication.



Following the British success, other newspapers sprang to life. From 1870 to 1890, Shanghai saw French, German, Japanese and Portuguese newspapers launched but most were short-lived. English-language newspapers dominated the market. As well as the North China Daily News, the evening newspaper the Shanghai Mercury, founded in 1879, was also very influential and widely read.



At the time when businessmen were establishing newspapers to meet a demand, missionaries were also launching newspapers trying to spread Christianity.



Two missionaries, Alexander Wylie and Alexander Williamson, published the first Chinese periodical the Shanghai Serial in 1857. Although they wanted to make it a newspaper, the Shanghai Serial articles mostly concerned religion, literature and science, and opened the door for Chinese intellectuals to begin expressing themselves in a new medium. The Serial folded after a year.



Important arrival



The most important Chinese newspaper in the city was the Shun Pao, the Shanghai News, which was launched in 1872 by a British businessman Ernest Maier and three friends. At that stage only one Chinese newspaper, the Chinese Shipping List and Advertisers, was being published and it had survived for 10 years but its limited coverage restricted its circulation to about 400 readers.



The Shanghai News arrived in a new format with more opinion pieces. Its front page could feature articles like ""An opinion on Japanese men and women bathing together"" alongside news items translated from foreign papers. Sometimes it translated works of fiction but ran them as if they were news. It also became popular because it ran articles by intellectuals for free - until then they had to pay to have opinions published.



At the start, the Shanghai News was published every other day but after four months it became a daily newspaper. It was so successful that the Chinese Shipping List and Advertisers was forced to shut down in 1872.



From the day the Shanghai News was created, it welcomed intellectuals who understood what the Chinese wanted to read as editors and chief reporters. When the Emperor Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) got married in 1872, the Shanghai News reported in detail what the emperor and his bride were wearing, the food that was served at the wedding banquet, the gifts that arrived and particulars of the ceremony.



The News was not popular with everyone and it had a stormy history, coming close to being shut on several occasions. In 1873 it reported the story of a Peking Opera performer who had fallen in love with the daughter of a rich Guangdong businessman and planned to get married. The family disapproved because opera performers were considered to be low class and it conspired with local officials to have the man arrested and thrown into prison where he was tortured which left him with a deformed foot. There were also reports saying it was the girl who had seduced the performer.



When the Shanghai News carried the story it expressed sympathy for the man and criticized the governor and the woman, reporting that women from Xiangshan in Guangdong were known to be flirtatious and many of them became prostitutes and foreigners' mistresses. The report angered Xiangshan people in Shanghai, who called for a boycott of the newspaper. Xiangshan businessmen and government officials set up their own newspaper in town to fight the News but the paper only lasted two years.



Publisher with purpose



In 1909, the Shanghai News was sold to a Chinese businessman Xi Yufu who ran it down somewhat leaving it with a circulation of just 7,000. In 1912 it was sold to Shi Liangcai, who made the Shanghai News the most influential Chinese newspaper of its time. By 1931 its circulation had reached 150,000.



Shi was born in 1880 in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province. He moved to Shanghai with his father, where his father ran a traditional Chinese medicine store. He gave up sitting the prestigious imperial examination after the failure of the Hundred Days' Reform movement in 1898. In 1904 Shi was appointed editor in chief of the Eastern Times, a newspaper established by Hundred Days' Reform movement backers.



After he took over the Shanghai News, he began publishing more articles about social welfare and reform. In 1915, Yuan Shikai, the president of the Republic of China (1912-1949), sent people to Shanghai to bribe the city's newspapers so that they would write favorably about his plan to become the emperor. The Shanghai News was an important target but Shi rejected the bribes and revealed the plot in the newspaper.



His battle with Beijing did not end there. After Yuan appointed himself emperor in 1916, he named his dynasty Hong Xian. But Shi Liangcai refused to use this title and the Shanghai News continued referring to the government as the Republic of China. Later the Japanese authorities forced him to use the term but he printed it in a typeface so small that it could hardly be read.



After the September 18 Incident of 1931 when the Japanese staged an attack to legitimize their invasion, Shi publicly expressed his love for his country through the newspaper. He said that the News should always try to represent ordinary people and not support any political party. Later the News criticized the Kuomintang attacks on the Red Army and published highly critical articles of Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang reportedly warned Shi one day: ""Don't piss me off! I have a million soldiers."" Shi retorted: ""I'm sorry, but I have a million readers.""



Shi was assassinated by the Kuomintang in 1934 but the Shanghai News continued, only stopping publication in May, 1949.



Political leanings



As well as the general newspapers in the city in the early days, several political journals thrived, basing themselves in the Shanghai concessions which protected them from the Chinese government. In the late Qing Dynasty papers and magazines like Wanguo Gongbao (A Review of the Times), Qiangxue Bao, Shiwu Bao, Min Li Pao spread ideas of constitutional reform and modernization, urging that the country learn from the West and adopt a capitalist system.



When the May Fourth Movement erupted in 1919, the Communist Party of China began publishing magazines and newspapers to promote the New Culture Movement. La Jeunesse, founded by Chen Duxiu in 1915, was one of the most influential Chinese magazines in the 1910s and 1920s. The Kuomintang also published newspapers like the Republican Daily News.



For most people then, the newspapers of choice were the tabloids which were racy, scandalous and highly entertaining. The tabloid newspapers reported bizarre stories, some of which may have been factual, and wrote a lot about celebrities. When the first tabloid, Youxi Bao (the Entertainment News) hit the streets in 1897, it published a list of the best prostitutes in the city. Other tabloids followed and in the 1920s, tabloids were carrying stories about how to gamble and how to have great sex with prostitutes. Academics sometimes supplied articles on entertainment. As the Qing Dynasty faltered, the tabloids took delight in mocking its government.



The most influential tabloid was Jing Pao (The Crystal) founded in 1919 which covered most aspects of life in a racy style. It closed in 1940. From 1897 to 1952, of the 1,786 newspapers published in Shanghai, 70 percent were tabloids. Today in China there remain about 1,900 newspapers with about 100 still being published in Shanghai.

(Image: Andrzej Krauze)

Editorial: “The risk of a flu pandemic is very real“

I EXPECTED the SHOC to be scary, and I was not disappointed. The Strategic Health Operations Centre at the World Health Organization in Geneva is like a war room for diseases. From here, WHO leaders coordinate the response to pandemics and other global crises, surrounded by giant screens displaying video calls and the latest data. The last time it was called into serious action was in 2009, during the swine flu pandemic.

On a quiet day last month it seemed pretty benign, all blond wood, white walls and a few murmuring staff. Then I looked at a screen displaying Twitter feeds. One was on Syrian chemical weapons. Another was on a new Middle Eastern respiratory virus that has been compared to SARS. Four more were on H7N9, the deadly bird flu that emerged in March in China.

Advertisement

On another screen I could see a count of flu cases, now topping 100 – more in two months than the long-feared H5N1 bird flu racks up in two years. A third had a map of eastern China marking all known cases.

That was when the place began to feel scary. Epidemiologists love maps. If the WHO is mapping H7N9, I thought, it must be worried.

I was right. Last week WHO flu chief Keiji Fukuda went to China to assess the situation. At a press conference he described H7N9 as “an unusually dangerous virus for humans” and “definitely one of the most lethal influenza viruses we have seen so far”. Fukuda is possibly the most measured, cautious scientist I have ever interviewed. This is serious.

This is an unusually dangerous influenza virus, one of the most lethal we have seen so far

H7N9 is a blend of bird flu viruses that has acquired a few mutations adapting it to infect people. It may occasionally pass from person to person via close contact, but is not yet spreading through the air like real human flu (at least not as New Scientist went to press). A few more mutations, though, might do it.

That would be very dangerous. Some claim that when bird flu adapts to mammals it invariably becomes less lethal, but that’s simply not true. The 1918 flu pandemic, the worst in history, was a bird virus that adapted to mammals. Most human cases of the new strain are already very severe, and mammal-adapted H5N1 is no less deadly than natural H5N1.

The worry now is that as H7N9 sporadically infects people, it might be acquiring the mutations it needs to go on the rampage.

That’s a good reason – alongside saving lives – to prevent human infections. But how? Fukuda’s team says the virus has mostly infected chickens, ducks and pigeons in live poultry markets – cauldrons of viral evolution that flu virologists have warned about for years. Shutting these down helps: Shanghai closed its markets in early April and the spread of H7N9 slowed dramatically. Shutting the rest, all over east Asia, will be a tall order, but not as expensive as the viral risks of these markets, which also transmitted SARS and H5N1.

Killing infected poultry might help too, but could be difficult: unlike H5N1, the virus doesn’t make chickens visibly ill. Poultry could be vaccinated, but that is risky: vaccinating them for H5N1 helped drive that virus’s evolution. Moreover, Chinese researchers report that H7N9 is not found on poultry farms but only in markets. The real source might be city pigeons.

Maybe we’ll get lucky and find that H7N9 can’t acquire those mutations and cut loose in mammals. But if it can, killing and vaccinating poultry and preventing human infections won’t stop a pandemic strain emerging. It will only slow it down.

When that happens, we will need vaccine. Oh dear. In the 2009 pandemic, vaccine arrived too late in the US to reach many people in the second wave – and many countries got none at all. Luckily, that flu was relatively mild. But that meant some governments didn’t bother to buy pandemic vaccine, and some that did tried to sell it back, which did not encourage companies to tool up to make more. Since then there has only been a small increase in the global capacity to make vaccine.

Most vaccine is still made by growing flu virus laboriously in chicken eggs, which takes six months – if you’re lucky. A few new factories that grow virus in cell cultures instead can expand production more readily, but are no quicker. And commercial factories won’t switch from ordinary flu vaccine to H7N9 until a pandemic is imminent. By then it will be too late.

As for antiviral drugs, normal supply doesn’t meet pandemic demand and cannot be ramped up quickly. The US ran short this year just from worse-than-usual winter flu.

There are several promising new technologies able to churn out vast quantities of pandemic vaccine quickly. But R&D funding has been limited. Only one is licensed, and for ordinary flu, not pandemic. It has one small manufacturing plant. None of the rest has even had a large-scale trial of its vaccines in people.

It could have been so different. After H5N1 appeared in 2004, or after the 2009 pandemic, we could have launched a major global programme to develop and test those technologies, modelled on the government-private sector partnerships that develop treatments for other unprofitable diseases such as TB. We didn’t.

Maybe if we start now, and slow the virus down, we will have enough time. Chances are low, but if we don’t even try they are zero.

As it stands, the WHO’s top brass will watch any H7N9 pandemic unfold from the SHOC. Information will flood in; body counts will mount. Governments will be told that their demands for vaccines and drugs cannot be met. The SHOC will issue declarations, hold briefings, organise research, tell people to wash their hands and stay home. Mostly, though, it will just watch helplessly.

10,10,FL-2013-000054-CHN,The World's Most Amazing Places: Shilin Stone Forest | The Weather Channel - Articles from The Weather Channel | weather.com - The Weather Channel,https://weather.com/science/nature/news/amazing-places-shilin-stone-forest-20130507,"Stretched across more than 180 square miles in China's Yunnan province, the giant limestone pillars of the Shilin Stone Forest are sometimes called the ""first natural wonder of the world,"" carved by rain, wind and seismic activity for millions of years.

It's easy to spend hours walking through these towering gray stalagmite-like rocks, which split into a series of stone forests filled with river caves, waterfalls, natural bridges and sinkholes.

The Chinese government opened up the forest to tourism for the first time in the 1950s and since then it has become one of the country's most popular attractions (though one reviewer described a visit there in August 2012 as ""overrun with tourists"").

What makes the stone forest so remarkable?

It's 270 million years old. The forest is part of a region known as the South China Karst, which spans more than 300,000 square miles and first appeared after the sea retreated during the Permian period, allowing the limestone outcroppings to rise. They've been shaped by erosion ever since into the karst shapes known today as Fengcong (cone) and Fenglin (tower).

Advertisement It feels like a fairy tale. Stone formations in the shapes of people, lions, birds, trees and flowers abound in the area called the Greater Stone Forest, while the Lesser Stone Forest is filled with grassy meadows, bamboo and trees, and a rock known as ""the Stone Singing Praises of Plums.""

Myths and legends. Nearby villagers tell stories of immortal beings that created the stone forest by smashing a mountain with their fists, leaving behind a maze of rocks as a place for lovers to retreat without being discovered. The most famous legend of all surrounds the Ashima stone, known today around the world.

A young girl in the forest once turned to stone. According to local legend, a beautiful girl named Ashima caught the eye of Azhi, the son of the Shilin village leader. When Ashima rejected him in favor of her beloved Ahei, however, Azhi kidnapped her and took her into the forest.

Ahei was able to free Ashima, but while coming back home she was caught in a river flood and drowned. Today, there's a stone named for her, and many locals say that if you call to her in the forest today, she will answer. (Of course, the sound you hear is probably just an echo.)

Relics from the 2008 earthquake are exhibited throughout the disaster zone to remember the past and prepare for the future.

Museum curator Fan Jianchuan believes relics not only remind us of our past but also point to our future. ""If I live another 30 years, I will see another major quake along the Longmen fault line,"" Fan told China Daily in March. Weeks later, on April 20, Lushan county was rocked by a magnitude-7 temblor that killed almost 200 people and injured another 12,000. Fan's forecast came from studying relics in the 22 halls of China's largest private museum, which he founded outside Chengdu. He cited the 2008 Wenchuan quake displays as some of the most prophetic before Ya'an's temblor. ""These relics are a wakeup call to Chinese,"" he says of the 100,000 or so artifacts in his museum from the 2008 Wenchuan quake, which left 90,000 people dead or missing. ""They inform decision-makers. That's my museum's most important lesson.""

Two halls also reference previous tectonic ruptures along Longmen, such as the 1933 quake that flooded a town in the Aba Tibetan and Qiang autonomous prefecture, which is still underwater, as well as another in 1976 that caused mass destruction.

Fan believes his museum's most illustrative exhibit is the wedding gown of a woman who drowned with her fiance in a flash flood caused by the 2008 quake.

""It's a testimony to the disaster's tragedy,"" Fan says. ""The brightest moment for two people starting their shared lives instantly became their dark end.""

Zhao Kaisheng, curator of the 5.12 Wenchuan Earthquake Memorial Museum, says the tremor contrasted the worst side of nature with the best of humanity.

Crushed cars, clocks stuck at the time of the quake and victims' shoes fill the 1.5-sq-km museum in Beichuan county. Many displays show the heroism of rescuers and ordinary survivors, while missing person notices line the walls of the chronologically arranged halls.

The museum's focus extends beyond the tragedy to its transformative power, propelled by people's compassion trumping nature's ruthlessness.

The first section introduces the disaster's recovery and rebuilding process. Statues commemorate the progress. An LED screen shows the changes in devastated areas.

Beichuan museum's interior is contemporary, but its exterior is built with antiquated rust-colored panels.

""This contrasts with the green when seen from above, where it looks like a tectonic fissure, and also appears old and solemn, like a memorial should,"" Zhao says. ""And since the building already looks rusty, it won't change over time.""

Beichuan, like many towns and cities in the quake zone, has opened ruins to the public as museums, memorials and historical relics.

Visitors can now investigate destroyed settlements, where stairwells spill in all directions, something akin to an M.C. Escher painting.

Constructed at the entrance of Hanwang's ruins is the Mianzhu Relief and Reconstruction Hall. The six-hall museum is adjacent to the town's iconic clock tower, which remains frozen at 2:28 pm — the moment disaster struck in 2008. The ruins opened to the public last year.

Visitors can walk over glass floors above items retrieved from the rubble — puckered fire extinguishers, crumpled bicycles and school children's dust-stained backpacks. One corridor is flanked by TV screens of people telling their stories, from the disaster to the recovery.

These recordings, like other museum relics, have much to say that is worth remembering from that day in 2008 that will guide construction for years to come.","Thu, 09 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/images/2013512/attachement/jpg/site1/20130509/0023ae9885da12f57ac556.jpg,"['museums', 'earthquake', 'museum', 'educate', 'memorial', 'fan', '2008', 'wenchuan', 'relics', 'ruins', 'commemorate', 'quake']",

13,13,FL-2013-000054-CHN,China Hits Back at Magazine Over Labor Camp Expose - Radio Free Asia,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/expose-05062013151906.html,"Authorities in the Chinese capital have halted publication of a cutting-edge magazine after it published a harrowing expose of life inside a labor camp, an employee said via social media.



The magazine Lens, which is published by the Beijing Caixun Media Group, had its May issue delayed after the article, which ran as the cover story in the April edition, sparked widespread horror and debate online.



A number of former inmates have detailed torture and ill-treatment which they said were a way of life at the Masanjia Women's Re-education Through Labor facility outside the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang.



Production of the May edition of Lens magazine has been temporarily halted, a staff member said on Monday.



The employee, who answered the phone at the magazine's editorial department in Beijing, said work had halted on the May edition for more than a week.



""We are already a week late with the magazine,"" the employee said. ""But it will come out; you should be able to buy it.""



Asked the reason for the delay, the employee replied: ""It's that [article]. The contents got us into some trouble.""



""It's definitely that one [about Masanjia],"" he said.



""It's not convenient for me to speak,"" he said. ""It's not easy, actually doing [reporting].""



Warned by police



Liaoning-based petitioner Gai Fengzhen said that Liaoning petitioner Zhao Min, the former inmate quoted in the Lens article, had received a call from her local police station last week, warning her not to give any interviews to overseas media.



""She sent me a text to say that the police called her .. .to warn her not to talk to foreign journalists, or they would sort her out,"" Gai said.



""Another [former inmate], Gao Fenglan, got a call from police, who wanted to come to her home, but she wouldn't open the door.""



A third former Masanjia inmate, Li Wenjuan, declined to comment following a visit to her home by police, during which she too refused to open the door.



She has said in previous interviews that a team set up by the Liaoning prosecutor's office to investigate the Masanjia facility appeared to be a front to appease popular opinion.



China's public has become increasingly angry over the ""re-education through labor"" system, which can be invoked by police for up to four years without need for a trial.



Officials had declined to put her evidence on file when she visited to testify about her time inside the camp, she said in interviews with RFA last month.



Media attacks



Meanwhile, the Lens article has also come under attack from China's state-run media, which is tightly controlled by the ruling Chinese Communist Party's central propaganda department.



An April 19 article in the Legal Daily newspaper said the article had relied mostly on overseas sources with close ties to the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement.



It said it had made use of ""counterfactual"" descriptions, with pernicious results.



But the Lens journalist in Beijing, who declined to give his name, said the investigation had been led by the magazine's bureau in Liaoning province.



""There was a very long lead time to research this article,"" he said. ""We have our own process of fact-checking our own interviews, and establishing a chain of evidence.""



""It is pretty reliable.""



He said next month's issue has a number of articles lined up about cancer. ""Lens has always covered social issues, and has a lot of human interest stories,"" he added.



Hard to ignore



A veteran journalist on the China Economic Times newspaper said it is becoming increasingly hard for Chinese media to ignore stories that surface on social media sites.



""There are so many ways of getting information, apart from the printed media. There is no way to stop the flood of information on any number of topics online,"" he said.



""But they are still in the old mindset, and they haven't moved with the times,"" he said of China's state-controlled media.



Calls to Liaoning provincial government offices and the police department went unanswered during office hours on Monday.

(CNN) — Police in China have spent three months seizing bogus meat, some of it fake beef or mutton made out of fox, mink and rat.

They snatched up around 20,000 tons of illegal products, according to state news agency Xinhua.

In 382 cases, officials arrested 904 suspects for passing off counterfeit meat, meat injected with water or diseased flesh to consumers, the news agency said.

Other offenders allegedly added chemicals illegally to their products, the agency said.

Two “meat processing and selling dens” in southwest China allegedly used hydrogen peroxide to process chicken claws, Xinhua said.

The raids were the first part of a food safety enforcement campaign from the Ministry of Public Security, Xinhua reported.

Next phase: dairy product crimes.

A ministry official told the news agency it expects to find deep-rooted safety problems.

The maps for the state are old and don't include flooding from fast-rising rivers and streams, the kind of flooding that tore up Vermont during Tropical Storm Irene.

Karin Hardy's house, built in 1850, once stood in Jamaica, Vt., across from the tranquil Ball Mountain Brook. But when Irene hit in August 2011, she heard boulders tumbling.

""The brook was really getting full, and it had an energy about it that made me uncomfortable, but I had no idea what was in store,"" Hardy says.

Hardy left her house without even packing a bag. After all, the house had stood there for well over a century. But the floodwaters charged downstream, plucking her house whole and hurling it against a bridge. Three of her neighbors also lost their homes.

The neighbors applied for a FEMA program that buys flood-damaged property in order to reduce future flood hazards. But FEMA determined these properties, and six others in Vermont, are not eligible for the program, in part because they are not located in ""Special Flood Hazard Areas"" on national flood maps.

These areas are where FEMA predicts there is a 1 percent chance every year that a flood of a certain size will occur. The maps, however, don't predict all floods, even the largest ones, including those caused by Irene.","Sun, 28 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/04/28/vermont_irene-6ddcac0257f0aed79f60e45642820154c1f6cb44.jpg?s=6,"['vermont', 'house', 'program', 'stood', 'irene', 'fema', 'flood', 'floods', 'flooding', 'neighbors', 'maps']",

Matteo Ricci, the Italian missionary who arguably published the first Chinese-language world map during his long stay in China, was believed to be the source of Chinese people's knowledge of world geography. But now a newly appraised Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) world map proves that the Chinese's exploration of world geography had started long before his arrival in 1583.

The Mongolia Mountain and Water Map, a silk hand scroll that measures 30.12 meters long and 0.59 meters in width, marked 211 places from Ming Dynasty's frontier Jiayuguan Pass westward to Mecca of today's Saudi Arabia, named as Tianfang on the map. The ""Mongolia"" in the map refers to the Mongol Empire that fractured into four khanates.

Stretching over Asia, Europe and Africa, the map covers more than 10 countries which exist today, such as Uzbekistan, Tunisia and Turkey. The Chinese names of the places were transliterated from nine languages including Mongolian, Arabic and Greek. What the map depicts is the exact route of the Ming Dynasty Silk Road, so it's now also known as the Ming Dynasty Silk Road Big Map.

According to Peking University's archaeology professor Lin Meicun, the map was collected by the Kyoto-based Museum of Fujii Yurinkan in the 1930s. But for a long time, it was treated as purely a Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) landscape painting and its real value was not known to the Japanese academic circle.

It was first identified as a Ming Dynasty map by historian Fu Xi'nian in 2002 when the map came back to Beijing after various efforts. From 2004, Lin Meicun embarked on a comprehensive study of the map. The academic value of the map was finally unveiled in a 200,000-word book in 2012, the fruit of Lin's painstaking eight-year research.

After studying the construction period of the buildings on the map, Lin concluded the map was painted between 1524 and 1539. Further evidence, such as block-printed editions of this map, led to a more surprising conclusion that it's highly possible the map was used by the Ming Dynasty's Jiajing Emperor (1522-1566).

Besides its geographical value, Lin says the map possesses great artistic value. There is evidence of influence from the painting style of the Wu school, a party of Suzhou and Wuxi-based literati painters - featuring the well-known Wen Zhengming and Tang Bohu - who were particularly fond of the mountainous landscapes.

The map will tour to Jiayuguan in Gansu province, followed by Beijing, Shanghai, Suzhou and Hainan. It will then be put under the hammer during Poly Auction's spring sales. The map's reserve price is 80 million yuan ($12.8 million).","Sat, 27 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20130419/0023ae9885da12dae66608.jpg,"['world', 'dynasty', 'places', 'ming', 'lin', 'long', 'map', 'chinadailycomcn', 'painting', 'silk', 'value']", 
19,19,FL-2013-000054-CHN,New dinosaur fossil discovered in China: Meat-eating dinosaur from late Jurassic period was less than a year old - Science Daily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130503132723.htm,"Fossil remains found by a George Washington University biologist in northwestern China have been identified as a new species of small theropod, or meat-eating, dinosaur.

The discovery was made by James Clark, the Ronald B. Weintraub Professor of Biology, in the Department of Biological Sciences of GW's Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. Dr. Clark, along with his then doctoral student Jonah Choiniere and a team of international researchers, found the dinosaur specimen in a remote region of Xinjiang in China in 2006.

In a research paper published in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology, Drs. Clark and Choiniere explain recovering the skull, mandible and partial skeleton of the dinosaur. The new theropod was an estimated 1 meter or just over 3 feet long and probably weighed about 3 pounds.

""All that was exposed on the surface was a bit of the leg,"" said Dr. Clark. ""We were pleasantly surprised to find a skull buried in the rock too.""

The dinosaur is named Aorun zhaoi, after the Dragon King in the Chinese epic tale Journey to the West. It wasn't necessarily a small dinosaur species, though, because Aorun was still a youngster when it became a fossil.

""We were able to look at microscopic details of Aorun's bones and they showed that the animal was less than a year old when it died on the banks of a stream,"" said Dr. Choiniere.

Dr. Choiniere, now a senior researcher at the Evolutionary Studies Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, was a doctoral student in Biological Studies at GW when the discovery was made. He was also a Kalbfleisch Fellow and Gerstner Scholar at the American Museum of Natural History.

Aorun lived more than 161 million years ago, in the earliest part of the Late Jurassic Period. Its small, numerous teeth suggest that it would have eaten prey like lizards and small relatives of today's mammals and crocodilians.

This is the fifth new theropod discovered at the Wucaiwan locality by the team, co-led by Dr. Clark and Dr. Xu Xing of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

This research was funded by the National Science Foundation Division of Earth Sciences and the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation.","Fri, 03 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,"['chinese', 'choiniere', 'small', 'university', 'discovered', 'fossil', 'jurassic', 'theropod', 'team', 'old', 'meateating', 'dinosaur', 'sciences', 'china', 'dr', 'late', 'clark', 'period']",

Photo: CFP

Five years ago, a dancer lost her legs and her 10-month-old daughter when an earthquake struck Wenchuan, Sichuan Province in 2008, leaving about 87,000 people dead or missing and more than 370,000 injured.



Two months after the quake, she performed her signature drum dance for people who were traumatized by the earthquake, encouraging them to restart life.



On April 20 this year, when an earthquake hit Lushan county in the same province, she arrived in disaster-ridden areas on the same day and helped victims pitch tents, distribute food and water and took part in the effort to rebuild their homes.



She is Liao Zhi, a 28-year-old dancer.



She once dreamed of becoming a top dancer. However, the 2008 earthquake altered the course of her life. Her lower legs were amputated after the Wenchuan earthquake took the life of her daughter.



""I was once buried underground and rescued by someone. Now, I really want to help others as a way of expressing my gratitude for them,"" she said.



Liao arrived in Longmen village, one of the hardest-hit areas in Lushan soon after the quake. She came there to help with rescue efforts and offer psychological comfort for those who were buried under debris.



Giving back



""When I was buried underground in 2008, it was a great comfort for me if I could hear people's voices. As long as you can hear people's voices, you can keep spirits up,"" Liao told the Global Times.



However, when she arrived, she found that the most urgent problem was that local villagers lacked tents, food and water.



""It rained the first several days after the earthquake, but the local villagers had no place to take shelter, because their houses were unsafe to live in. We had to help them make tents,"" Liao said.



By that time, few disaster-relief materials had been transported to remote villages including Longmen because of traffic congestion. Liao and other volunteers drove to Ya'an, seat of Lushan county, and spent 4,000 yuan ($647.60) on plastic sheets and tarpaulins and helped villagers erect dozens of tents within five days of the quake.



They also distributed instant noodles and bottled water to local villagers, but the supply was limited. Liao and her partners were so exhausted, having barely slept or eaten during this time. In her microblog, Liao wrote, ""Aftershocks came again and again, but I didn't have the strength to stand up and run.""



Liao left the disaster area and returned to Chongqing five days after the quake. News of her volunteer work has aroused controversy, as some people doubt her motives. Web users have suggested that Liao went to the disaster zone to seize public attention, because she has been participating in a dance talent show.



""You cannot be distracted by people's doubts about you. People who really want to help do not care about criticism,"" Liao said.



Earth-shattering events



Liao has walked through the valley of the shadow of death.



When the 2008 earthquake hit, Liao, her mother-in-law and her daughter were buried under their collapsed house. Her daughter and mother-in-law died immediately by her side. Desperate, Liao had also planned to give up on her life and refused to respond to the rescuers until she heard her father's call.



""My father stood on the debris, told rescuers he would never leave the site if I did not respond. I had to answer him, and I realized I had to live,"" Liao said.



After being buried for 26 hours, she was rescued. When she was brought out from under the rubble, her neighbors all came and surrounded her, telling her to live well, because she was the only survivor who had been buried under that building.



Unfortunately, her legs had to be amputated - not only was she a mother who lost her child, she became a dancer who lost her feet. Life became a flood of tears.



Even though she is handicapped, Liao says she cannot give up dancing. ""Dancing is my life,"" Liao told the Global Times.



After these devastating events, a friend came to visit her and asked her whether she would ever dance again. She wiped away her tears and answered yes.



She began practicing walking on her prosthetic legs, which proved to be no easy task.



""She bled every time she practiced dancing. I told her to give up, but she wouldn't listen,"" Bai Jia, Liao's mother, said. The dancer was determined, drawing inspiration from childhood fairytale ""The Little Mermaid.""



""She danced and danced, even though each time she put her foot on the ground, she felt she was walking on the edge of a sword,"" she quoted from the story during her interview.



Dancing through the pain



Over time, she invented a new type of dancing, drum dance, where she stands on a drum and beats out rhythms with her prosthetic feet. Audiences have drawn much inspiration from her performances, which express the resilience of the human spirit.



As a member of the Chengdu Disabled Persons Artistic Performance Troupe, she has traveled all over Sichuan and other provinces holding charity events. She also hosted a gala with other performers to raise money for the victims of the 2008 earthquake.



Despite the passing of time, the pain of losing her daughter has not faded. When the sorrow overcomes her, she says, she dances.



On Children's Day last year, Liao wept as she performed in front of children at a local kindergarten in Chongqing. It was impossible not to think of her child.



""Chongchong never celebrated one single Children's Day before she left the world,"" Liao said. At the end of her performance, Liao sang a song for her daughter in heaven as a Children's Day present to her.



She often dreams about her daughter. In one recurring dream, Chongchong tells her she is only playing hide-and-seek and that she will come back when the game is over, leaving Liao to awaken to her pillow soaked in tears.



Her life collapsed again when her husband divorced her. He said he could never forget the image of their dead daughter as long as he could see his wife.



In 2009, Liao became a Christian. Through reading the Bible and going to church, she gradually recovered from the sadness of losing the daughter and the breakdown of her family. She began focusing on doing charity work to give back to society.



Since 2009, Liao has been teaching dance to children as part of a psychological therapy.



""Fostering children's love for dance can offer them a good path for recovering from trauma,"" Liao said.



Liao's biggest dream is to establish a charity foundation to help people who lose family members and treasured belongings in earthquakes.","Thu, 02 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.globaltimes.cn/images/gfavicon.ico,"['standing', 'earthquake', 'life', 'buried', 'villagers', 'dance', '2008', 'daughter', 'liao', 'help', 'legs', 'im']",

Istanbul on citywide shut down. Riot police gassed and fired water cannons at dozens of demonstrators

Spain and Italy -- two countries blighted by the eurozone debt crisis -- have seen street protests

As European financial markets close for the spring celebration of May Day, protesters across Europe and beyond have taken to the streets to demonstrate for workers' rights and, in many cases, against painful austerity measures.

In Istanbul, Turkey, riot police gassed and fired water cannons at dozens of demonstrators trying to get to the popular-tourist destination of Taksim Square for May 1 demonstrations.

Groups carrying May 1 international Workers' Day banners and chanting ""Longlive Workers' Day"" while trying to the square were dispersed using water cannons and tear gas in Istanbul's Besiktas district.

Istanbul is now on a citywide shut down. Traffic has been restricted and public transportation to the square has been suspended including subways, metrobuses as well as ferry services that connect the city's European side to the Asian side.

""We are expecting a problematic May 1,"" said Istanbul Governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu told broadcaster CNNTurk. ""It would have been easy to solve this,"" he said.

Across the Aegean Sea, Greeks are turning out in Athens to show their anger at austerity measures that have sent the country's economy into a tailspin.

But Nathalie Savaricas, a Greek journalist, told CNN that Labor Day protests in Athens were relatively muted this year as fewer Greeks decided to demonstrate.

""There is a sense of resignation among Greeks, she told CNN.""What we're hearing now is some 45,000 protesters have assembled in the city center to protest against austerity, and against tax hikes and all the policies that have been continued by Prime Minister Samaras and his team.""

Savaricas told CNN that the government is simply following the demands of the troika -- a group of international creditors made up of the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank -- which have led the debt-ridden nation's economy into the ""abyss.""

Greece has a debt to GDP level of 156% while government debt stands at a staggering 304 billion euros. The country -- one of four eurozone countries to request a sovereign bailout -- is also grappling with unemployment of over 27%, the highest in the single currency area, according to Eurostat, the Commission's data service.

Savaricas said many of her friends have fled abroad in search of a brighter future: ""What they're telling me is that the Greeks are very much seen with contempt and the opportunities abroad are not that great because Europe is also suffering.""

She added that many Greeks at home are pinning their hopes on Samaras retracting some of the government's harsh austerity measures while reducing domestic bureaucracy to encourage foreign investment.

Spain and Italy -- two other countries blighted by the eurozone debt crisis -- have also seen demonstrations on the streets.

In the Spanish capital Madrid and the country's second city, Barcelona, thousands of protesters marched with some displaying signs 'Bread and shelter at fair price!'

Some denounced Bankia, Spain's fourth-largest and partially state-owned bank that requested a 19 billion euro bailout in 2012. Other signs read: ""Where is our money? Swindlers.""

Francisco Carrizo , 37, a Venezuelan teacher from Madrid, told CNN that people in Spain don't feel like celebrating May Day because unemployment is so high and the ""government should be ashamed.""

In 2007, before the global economic crisis hit, Spain had 1.9 million people unemployed -- 8.6% of the active population. That figure has now risen to 6.2 million.

Figures from Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Spain's national statistics office, showed unemployment among 16 to 24 year-olds is at 57.2%. Joblessness is higher among women than men.

Carizzo told CNN: ""I feel kind of bad because in my case I have two jobs. It's the sort of thing I don't usually tell people. I feel sad, let down and I have mixed feelings about it."" He added: ""There are people who are having a really hard time.""

High unemployment and cuts to the public sector are being felt in Italy too. Unemployment reached 11% in March, while the country remained in political deadlock since the elections in February failed to yield a government.

May Day protests have reportedly taken place in Rome as well as Bologna and Parma in the Emilia Romagna region of Italy.

Martina Lunardelli , 28, interpreter, Pordenone, northern Italy, told CNN that she feels ""ashamed"" of all the political and economic turmoil that has dogged the eurozone third-largest economy since the debt crisis began in 2010.

""I am trying to flee from here,"" she told CNN. ""I have lost all the residual faith I had in what should be my home country.""","Thu, 02 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg,"['cnn', 'protests', 'told', 'greeks', 'day', 'protesters', 'flood', 'watch', 'watched', 'streets', 'europe', 'unemployment', 'debt']",

25,25,FL-2013-000054-CHN,New bay dawning - The Economist,https://www.economist.com/asia/2013/04/27/new-bay-dawning,"UNDER British colonial rule Sittwe, or Akyab as it was then called, was one of the busiest ports in Burma, or Myanmar as it is now called. Burma was the world’s biggest exporter of rice and a lot of it was shipped from Sittwe, in Rakhine state. Now the city is more associated with ethnic cleansing; it was the site of murderous riots last year against Muslim Rohingyas. Old rice mills and river steamers are rotting away in the tropical damp, much like the rest of the place—except the port itself.

This shines like a beacon of bustle amid the torpor, as a large new terminal takes shape beside the old harbour. This is a joint project between India and Myanmar drawing in $100m. Taking advantage of the port’s site at the mouth of the river Kaladan, which empties into the Bay of Bengal, India hopes to open its own landlocked and impoverished north-eastern states. Container ships would offload at Sittwe onto smaller vessels that can ferry goods up the Kaladan. Lorries would take them the final leg over the Indian border. If that sounds tortuous, enthusiasts say it could cut days off the overland route from the Indian “mainland” to the north-east, round the top of Bangladesh (though improvements to those road and rail links could yet imperil the whole project).

But that is only one of many ambitious ventures under way along the eastern half of the Bay of Bengal. Once home to one of the world’s great trading networks, the bay looks poised to rise again.

Booming Asian economies have long since outgrown their ports. Sprawling Kolkata, for instance, the oldest colonial port on the Bay of Bengal, has been unable to take in bigger modern vessels for years. It lies 232km (144 miles) inland up the river Hooghly, which has gradually silted up. As the head of its port trust, Raj Pal Kahlon, notes dryly, “We cannot survive just on dredging.” Local and national governments have approved the construction of a spanking new deepwater port on Sagar island, at the mouth of the Hooghly, at a cost of 80 billion rupees ($1.5 billion). Any such work must contend with ramshackle state politics, but tenders are out for a container terminal farther upstream, too.

Bangladesh’s Chittagong, the biggest port this side of the bay, has also become a bottleneck. The Bangladeshis are modernising it, but pin hopes of further growth on the site of a vast new deepwater container terminal to its south. China is putting $200m towards upgrading the airport at Cox’s Bazar, the country’s southernmost tip, to attract investment and tourists.

Myanmar’s opening overshadows the rest. Its new government, keen for foreign inflows to help rebuild the economy, has been approving projects that sat idle for years. Sittwe is one, but it looks small compared with the Dawei project on Myanmar’s Tenasserim coast. This is mainly a Thai affair: a deepwater port, industrial zone and highways to connect it with distant Bangkok, estimated to cost $8.5 billion.

Thailand’s rulers dabbled for centuries with the idea of building a canal across the Kra isthmus, which would link their own gulf directly to the Andaman Sea and save days of costly shipping through the Strait of Malacca. Dawei should do the trick. There are also grand plans to improve roads from Bangkok to Cambodia and Vietnam, giving those countries easy access to Dawei and the bay beyond. The Japanese are taking advantage of Myanmar’s opening to build a riverine port called Thilawa, south of Yangon. This should cost about 20 billion yen ($200m)—and displace Yangon’s clapped-out port.

The Chinese are exploring ways round their own Malacca-strait dilemma. They have been building new oil and gas pipelines across the whole of Myanmar starting from a new port-terminal at Kyaukphyu, near Sittwe. The lines run through Mandalay to Ruili on the border and beyond to Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province. This ends China’s need to ship all its oil from Africa and the Middle East through the choke-points of Singapore and the South China Sea.

In commercial terms, the trans-shipment terminals of Malaysia and Singapore could lose out. But Sukh Deo Muni, of Singapore’s Institute of South Asian Studies, reckons they “would not necessarily suffer, as the new connectivity will generate more economic activity”. As for the strategic rivalry between China and India, Mr Muni argues that China’s activity in the Bay of Bengal is purely “defensive”. Maybe, but Indians versed in the “string of pearls” theory, which sees Chinese-built ports encircling India, will not be much comforted.

Amid the sometimes airy speculation, it is relatively easy to predict the effects on the repurposed waters of the bay. Yugraj Yadava, the director of an environmental watchdog in Chennai, says increased shipping is already eroding traditional livelihoods and polluting the sea. About 31% of the world’s coastal fishermen live and work on the Bay of Bengal, and they stand to lose huge tracts to the port-builders (and to rising sea levels, too). Mr Yadava says the bay still has some of the world’s healthiest natural fisheries, but they are under threat, not least from non-native species that stow away in long-haulers’ ballast.

Collisions between fishing vessels and commercial ships are becoming more frequent, as are snagged nets. All this will probably accelerate in the next few years. Before the Bay of Bengal falls victim to its new-found popularity, it might be good if some of its beneficiaries were to build a transnational maritime authority, to limit the damage.","Sat, 27 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.economist.com/engassets/og-fallback-image.f1ea908894.png,"['bay', 'bengal', 'india', 'sittwe', 'dawning', 'terminal', 'port', 'worlds', 'vessels', 'ports', 'south']",

Though Realism is popular among the general public, it has its critics, says Zhang Kun in Shanghai, who reports on a new show at the Long Museum.

Despite the heavyweight artworks and big name artists, Long Museum's new exhibition has met with challenges from critics.

Experiencing Simplicity: Realistic Paintings from Long Collection in Shanghai's Pudong will be held until Aug 30.

It showcases more than 50 works created by Chinese Realist artists such as Jin Shangyi, Chen Danqing, Yang Feiyun, and Chen Yifei.

The artists include respected professors and those who have fetched record prices at auctions, while many of the paintings are familiar works because of media exposure.

Yet Jia Fangzhou, curator of the show, says organizing the exhibition was a risk since Realism is frequently criticized by contemporary art critics for being little more than photographic replicas, like the portrait of a flutist by Chen Yifei.

Lyu Peng, a critic, once challenged artist Leng Jun on his meticulous painting style and asked, ""What's the point?""

Jia defends Leng by saying that the artist's obsessive attention to detail may seem unnecessary, yet have strong expressive power.

The media launch ceremony was aired live on ZIZ Broadcasting Corporation with DJ ‘G-Cue’ who interacted ‘in- house’ with Digicel St. Kitts-Nevis’ newly-appointed Country Manager Johnny Ingle and Customer Experience Manager Kenneth Bobb.

One of the hot selling phones was the Alcatel 903 handset at EC$ 199 which has 4G capability.

Eye-catching and creative human interactive advertisement mechanisms used for the 4G launch saw Digicel brand-attired Mocko Jumbies, a full-body painted ‘4G’ man with marketing sign on his legs.

Speaking with SKNVibes, Ingle expressed his delight with the support of the public who came out in their numbers.

“It was absolutely fantastic. We couldn’t have wished forbetter,” he said.

Ingle pointed out that there was no disruption in service on that day and that the company had sold many 4G mobile handsets during the launch.

He revealed that people visited the stores on the following day and also earlier today (Apr. 27).

“We are so excited to provide to the good people of St. Kitts and Nevis,” Ingle remarked.

Ingle highlighted that 4G stands for “Fourth Generation” which he said is a “new standard” based on HSPA + technology which gives speed “100 times faster than Edge” when it comes to activities like surfing the net and downloading videos.

He pointed out that these are challenging economic times for people, noting that Digicel is making sure it provides the “best service at all time”.

SKNVibes understand that there was a similar level of excitement on sister isle Nevis on the 4G launch day.

In a press release issued yesterday (Apr. 26), Ingle disclosed that his company has built the first all-island 4G coverage.

""When Digicel launched in St. Kitts and Nevis almost seven years ago, we changed the face of telecommunications across the country. With this launch, we are about to do the same again. With this investment in our St. Kitts and Nevis business, we have built the first all island coverage 4G cellular network in the country giving customers the fastest mobile data speeds-while continuing to deliver best service and best value with our affordable data packages and latest handsets the market has to offer. Digicel is delivering the best mobile experience for choice, value, speed and coverage in St. Kitts and Nevis.""

As of Monday (Apr. 29), customers can access the 4G network by purchasing a 4G plan for their phones.

Alain Merieux, founder of the global IVD (in vitro diagnosis) company BioMerieux meets the press in Beijing April 27, 2013.

Mr. Alain Merieux, founder of the global IVD (in vitro diagnosis) company BioMerieux, member of the French political and commercial mission led by the French president Francois Holland, met with Yang Xiong, mayor of Shanghai Municipality today and signed ""the Cooperation Agreement on Biological Sample Extraction and Program Training"" with relevant departments after the meeting. Mr. Alain Merieux disclosed at the subsequent press conference that BioMerieux is researching on a type of method through which H7N9 virus may be detected in a rapid and accurate. In view of the rapidly developing market in China, BioMerieux is expected to expand its Phase II project at its Shanghai Site as early as in the end of this year after obtaining the approval of local government. By that time, the new medical program of bacterial detection will be put into operation.

Ever-growing Chinese market

BioMerieux has long been the world leader in VID in the past five decades. With 41 subsidiaries covering more than 160 countries in the world, BioMerieux is blessed with a strong business network. It recorded EURO1.57 billion in operating income in 2012 and 87% of which came from its operations outside of France. Although the proportion of operations in the United States, Europe and other developed countries takes the lead, its continuous growth on the Chinese market has been remarkable.

In 2011, BioMerieux registered a 27% of annual growth rate in China; in 2012, the growth rate exceeded 40%, far much higher than that of previous years. It's because of the high-speed development in China that BioMerieux has realized continuous increase in operating income despite of the weak economic landscape in the world in general, and in Europe in particular.

As things stand, the history of BioMerieux's entrance into China could be traced back to 1978. Back then, Mr. Alain Merieux led the Institut Merieux to visit China, opening the door of serving the Chinese market; in 1985, BioMerieux sold its first medical instrument in China; in 1995, BioMerieux set up its sales office in Shanghai which is responsible for its sales and marketing operation in China. The development of BioMerieux in China in the past more than thirty years has been truly expressive thanks to China's reform and opening-up policy and medical system reform, especially the astounding advances in rational use of antibiotics, food safety monitoring and other fields.

After rapid development in the past two years, BioMerieux China has ranked the third among the Organization and next only to America and France; and its Shanghai office has become one of the top three global strategic centers of BioMerieux.

According to Mr. Alain Merieux, Shanghai is of strategic importance for BioMerieux in two aspects: first, it can provide technologies more suitable for China; and second, it can produce high quality products both China and the wider international community need. Between April 2010 and March 2011, 7.4 million HIV/AIDS detection kits and 5 million Hepatitis B detection kits of BioMerieux produced by its China joint ventures were exported to 73 countries.

The Chinese government is planned to invest US$90 billion in medical treatment from 2010 to 2020 and the IVD market has increased from US$600 million five years ago to today's US$2 billion, next only to the emerging market in the US and Germany.

""In view of the rapidly developing market in China, BioMerieux is expected to expand its Phase II project at its Shanghai Base as early as in the end of this year after obtaining the approval of local government. By that time, the new medical program of bacterial detection will be put into operation,"" said Mr. Alain Merieux, ""China will become the base camp of BioMerieux's global development.""

All-round Cooperation Contributes to Win-win Scenario

BioMerieux has developed its unique culture –Win-win Cooperation - after more than thirty years of development in China. In 2007, it joined forces with Kehua Bio-engineering in establishing the joint venture Shanghai BioMerieux IVD Company; in 2009, Transgene, its biotech arm specializing in producing therapeutic cancer vaccines, worked with China's largest TCM enterprise Tasly Group in establishing Tasly-Transgene (Tianjin) Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd.. On top of that, it also collaborated with Silliker China and Beijing Quality Supervision and Inspection Center in establishing the joint venture in the field of food safety detection in Shanghai. These joint ventures have contributed a lot to the ever-rising growth rate of BioMerieux in China.

In addition, BioMerieux has also greatly benefited from cooperation programs it launched in the field of public health. In late-2012, it signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the Changzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention in officially using the demonstrative lab for microbiological detection standardization built by the two sides. With 9 latest detecting instruments and 1 central processing system introduced from BioMerieux, the lab can rapidly detect pathogenic bacterium among numerous bacteria, complete the analysis on the source of pathogenic bacterium after food poisoning and find the first transmitter, playing an important role in effectively controlling infection source and epidemic.

It is worth mentioning that Foundation Mérieux, the non-profit organization affiliated to BioMerieux, also actively participates in the prevention and control of infectious diseases and the resistance of antibiotic abuse. For instance, the second round of tuberculosis prevention and control program launched last year, the result of cooperation with the Ministry of Health, is designed to help western China build up its capacity in rapid diagnosis of multi-drug resistance tuberculosis.","Sun, 28 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20130428/eca86bd9d54312e728b701.jpg,"['chinese', 'shanghai', 'merieux', 'alain', 'detection', 'cooperation', 'program', 'grows', 'biomerieux', 'china', 'medical', 'market']",

Xi, Hollande vow to push ties and build multipolar world order

Beijing and Paris signed 18 deals on Thursday, including deals for 60 Airbus planes and a nuclear project, as President Xi Jinping hosted his first head of state from a major Western country, French President Francois Hollande.

The trip by Hollande, described by many in the French media as ""a sales tour"" since he brought along a planeload of businessmen, also saw the two countries agree to establish an economic and financial high-level dialogue to further promote economic cooperation.

President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan welcome French President Francois Hollande and partner Valerie Trierweiler in Beijing on Thursday. Xu Jingxing / China Daily

Analysts said the visit will help the countries renew dialogue under new leaderships and enhance China-EU ties.

A significant portion of the 60 planes will be manufactured at an Airbus factory in Tianjin, an industry source told AFP on condition of anonymity.

The countries signed 17 other agreements ­on tourism, agricultural products, nuclear power and urbanization.

French nuclear giant Areva and Chinese energy group China National Nuclear Corporation signed letters of intent on the construction of a nuclear-waste treatment plant.

""I look forward to the future of our global strategic partnership and to working with you to make our relationship closer, healthier and more vibrant,"" Xi said at a news conference with Hollande.

Hollande said he brought a group of businessmen to provide the most suitable and most needed products for the Chinese market.

He promised that Chinese investments will not encounter obstacles as long as they bring jobs and development.

""I welcome them all, and the sooner the better,"" the French president said.

Observers said the visit comes amid the most difficult time for Hollande since being elected in May last year.

His domestic approval rating has been driven to a record low 26 percent by stubbornly high unemployment amid the protracted financial crisis.

France registered a $34 billion trade deficit with China last year, and the country accounts for less than 2 percent of China’s foreign trade.

""There is an imbalance in our foreign trade, and we hope to correct that,"" Hollande said. ""Not by reducing our investment and exports, but by increasing them further, and we will be discussing this throughout our meetings and on this trip.""

More Chinese investment in France and further opening up in transportation, energy and urban services, where French firms excel, are part of the solution to correct the deficit, said Francois Godement, China specialist and professor at the Paris Institute of Political Studies.

But the imbalance, partly from France’s economic structure, can hardly be changed overnight, said Ding Yifan, deputy director of the World Development Research Institute at the Development Research Center of the State Council.

""For example, nuclear energy and aircraft are two pillars of the French economy, while exports of these products are limited,"" he said.

Martine Aubry, special representative of the French Foreign Affair Ministry to China, said France should develop its market share in China.

""China has major challenges in which France has huge potential, such as the ageing population and chronic diseases, urbanization and sustainable development, and healthy diets,"" Aubry said.

Jean-Marie Le Guen, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly, said tightening ties with China will facilitate the access of EU companies to the Chinese market.

""Growth in China is a chance not only for Asian countries, but for the EU as well. Our mutual responsibility is to ensure that everybody can benefit from it,"" he said.

Xi said at the news conference that the two countries would ""actively promote a multipolar world and the democratization of international relations"".

""China and France both want a multipolar world. We want there to be a balance. We refuse a world of powers, and of superpowers,"" Hollande said. ""When China and France agree on a position, we can drive the world.""

The two-day visit will also take Hollande to Shanghai.

Bamboo processing is a major industry in Zhejiang province's Anji county, which produces about 20 percent of the country's bamboo. Photos by Erik Nilsson / China Daily

The prosperity of the bamboo industry in Zhejiang province's Lin'an county has come from community-driven development, in which farmers reach consensus with agricultural scientists, the local government says.

""The farmers' prosperity has been self-determined rather than from policies derived by government decree,"" Chinese Forest Academy of Bamboo Professionals committee member Wang Anguo explains.

""Farmers must be involved if their situation is to improve. We can't just give them orders.""

The county's bamboo production is 3 billion yuan ($487 million) a year, accounting for 55 percent of the local GDP. About 253 million yuan comes from exports.

Lin'an's population of 250,000 dwell on 3,100 square kilometers, 65,833 hectares of which are covered with bamboo. About 32,600 hectares of those are for edible shoots.

It hosts about 100 processing factories. About 70 percent of the staff are farmers, including administration, Wang says.

The county even publishes the Lin'an Bamboo Newsletter.

Various levels of government also provide bamboo producers 1,500-3,000 yuan in annual subsidies.

The county is host to 67 types of moso (giant) bamboo, although moso bamboo represents only about 30 percent of its total bamboo coverage. There are 20 species in the county.

The most common is huangtian zhu (yellow-sweet bamboo), which is celebrated not only for being delicious but also for its ability to draw toxic substances from soil and prevent erosion.

""Farmers across the country used hazardous pesticides from the 1960s until the '90s,"" Wang says.

""So, we've been planting huangtian zhu around China to clean the earth.""

This is especially important in Lin'an, which is a major producer of edible shoots.

Workers in Zhejiang province's Anji county process bamboo strips, which is the first step in producing virtually all bamboo goods.

Bamboo also absorbs CO2 at an incredible rate, Wang explains, waving his hand toward a slew of glass domes containing moso bamboo plants.

Lin'an trains up to 5,000 people from poor communities in China, especially ethnic areas. It also trains about 500 from developing countries.

The county is a major producer of ornamental bamboo and hosts the 70-hectare Hangzhou Lin'an Taihuyuan Ornamental Bamboo Planting Garden.

""Bamboo makes Lin'an beautiful in every way,"" Wang says.

In addition to the dune projects, he said, some farmers in western parts of the Netherlands collect rainwater from the roofs of their greenhouses during the fall and winter, inject it into a well for storage and retrieve it during the growing season, he said.

Storing water underground also may reduce the need to dam up rivers, and avoids losing water to evaporation. Evaporation can be such a problem that some reservoirs in arid areas of the world, including western Texas, lose more water each year into the air than people actually use.

The aquifer itself can also serve as something of a natural cleanser, according to Mr. Missimer. This especially helps in instances in which water utilities store treated wastewater in the ground, as happens in El Paso, Texas, for example.

However, not every aquifer is well-suited to the technology. Florida, where underground-reservoir technology has been used for several decades, faced some early struggles with arsenic in the water, and other challenges as well.

“It’s been a learning process,” said Bob Verrastro, the lead hydrologist with the South Florida Water Management District, which has financed several projects that use the technology.

Florida utilities like the idea because demand for water is seasonal: Americans flock to Florida in the winter, but it rains the hardest in the summer. So storage is important.","Wed, 01 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2013,"['utilities', 'florida', 'storage', 'safe', 'winter', 'western', 'projects', 'technology', 'water', 'underground', 'reservoirs', 'texas']",

Forty-one years after former US president Richard Nixon's landmark visit to China, the two sides are seeking to improve bilateral ties, which are facing ""another turning point"", as a 40-member delegation from the United States retrace the trip's legacy.

""China has become a strong economy. I think the legacy of the trip will endure, and I've seen that through my travels throughout the world,"" said Christopher Nixon Cox, the son of the 37th US president's daughter, Tricia, on Friday.

""He always said we should never leave a billion of the world's most hard-working people in isolation,"" Cox said. ""His philosophy was that a strong and prosperous China would be a pillar for the peace and stability of the world.""

Cox, the head of the delegation, was born in 1979, the year that Sino-US diplomatic relations were established. After arriving in Beijing on Thursday, he is leading a 10-day ""Nixon Centennial Legacy Journey"" tour to the same venues in Beijing, Hangzhou and Shanghai that Nixon and his entourage visited in 1972.

Nixon's visit that ended 25 years of mutual silence, paved the way for the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between China and the US. The tour is also being regarded as a tribute to Nixon a century after his birth in 1913.

It was not easy for Beijing and Washington, with vastly different mindsets and economic strengths, to break the ice and the countries' current leaderships should learn from their predecessors how to properly address their differences. The shared interests of China and the US are much larger than before, said Jia Qingguo, a professor at Peking University's School of International Studies.

As a challenge to break these habits and avoid the rut, every few weeks Shanghaiist will explore one of the more intriguing options out of China’s endless array of curious cookery. Although bizarre to most Western palates, these oft-avoided edibles usually boast unique medicinal properties, nutritional benefits, and intriguing culinary histories. We’ll explore for you where they came from and where you can sample these rare eats for yourselves.

YELLOW MUD SNAIL (黄泥螺, huáng ní luó)

Regions of use: China (Ningbo, Shanghai, other coastal areas)

Tasted at: Chang Jiao Hai Xian (长脚海鮮) // 429 Pingliang Lu, Tongbei Lu (平凉429路, 近通北路) // Closest metro stop: Yangshupu Road (杨树浦路) Line 4

With a pale, gelatinous body that dwarfs its shell, a live yellow mud snail looks more like a glob of jelly with a skullcap than like your typical garden snail. It’s name, which comes from the yellowish mud flats of Ningbo where it abounds, didn’t exactly stir the appetite either. But neither did “hairy crab,” “this chicken has no sexual experience,” or names of other Chinese eats I now enjoy, so I gave it an escar-go.

Culinary history/medicinal properties

Historical documents show that the mud snail was first eaten by coastal Chinese in the Song Dynasty (960-1279). However, it only became popularized in Shanghai 50 years ago by Ningbo immigrants who had brought the snails with them during a massive immigration wave. In fact, many Shanghaiers today keep containers of snails preserved in salty sauce or yellow wine. They enjoy both their flavor and their reputed benefits to the eyes, kidney, lungs, and liver that come from the minerals in the mud they inhabit. Consuming them with wine is also said to help prevent TB and laryngitis.

Where to get them





Live yellow mud snails

Most mud snails in Shanghai come salted and/or preserved in yellow wine in jars or cans. For live ones, you have to hit up Tongchuan Road or our favorite depot, Chang Jiao Hai Xian, a down-home seafood eatery on Tongbei Lu offering every sea eat from cuttle fish eggs to geoduck. You pick your live snails from one of the fish tanks and choose to have them cooked in soup, served drunken with yellow wine, or probably the tastiest method, stir fried. Though raw and drunken is more in the spirit of this column, not only do they taste overly salty in our mind, but eating raw seafood can be hazardous in this increasingly warm weather.

For stir-frying, they’re doused with salt so they expel their water and shrink drastically in size like a grape shriveling into a raisin, and then tossed about with chilies, onions, soy, and other seasonings. They’re served shell-on like mussels.

Reactions

After polishing off a plate, we surmised that the biggest turn-off to expats isn’t the name nor globular appearance when live. It’s that they’re freaking tiny! Each shell is as small and brittle as the nail on your pinky finger, and houses less meat than a hermit crab claw. You have to first tease the flesh nub out with your teeth, and then discard that black speck of digestive tract, a task so tedious we eventually gave up and scarfed them bad bits and all. After an hour of gold-panning-like sifting and dissecting, the meat we ate amounted to less than several clams worth.

But we’d be lying if we told you that these weren’t the tastiest snails we’ve ever had. Brinier and tenderer than most clams, these guys beat out escargot, pork-stuffed river snails, or those little river periwinkles. Just bring friends along so it doesn’t take you an hour to finish the plate, and order plenty of other dishes so you won’t leave hungry.

Our verdict

The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.

After the acquisition, iQiyi CEO Gong Yu will remain at the helm, while PPS founder Zhang Hongyu and president Xu Weifeng will serve as co-presidents at the new entity, Baidu said.

The acquisition is Baidu's latest step to diversify businesses beyond its core search sector.

China's online video industry has struggled for profits due to the high cost of content, but eyeing long-term advertising revenues in the booming mobile Internet sector, major market players have stepped up efforts to foster mobile user base despite current difficulties.

The latest deal would make iQiyi a more competent contender to industry leader Youku Tudou Inc., which was created last year through the merger of the country's two major video giants Youku and Tudou.

Other players in the field include Internet giant Sohu's video unit, PPTV, Letv and Funshion.","Tue, 07 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20130507/f04da2db148412f3094f01.jpg,"['video', 'youku', 'baidu', 'pps', 'players', 'iqiyi', 'latest', 'online', 'search', 'buys', '370m', 'business', 'mobile']",

[Photo/Agencies]

Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands abdicated on Tuesday, handing over to her eldest son, Willem-Alexander, who became the first king of the Netherlands in more than 120 years.

An estimated 25,000 well-wishers cheered outside the Royal Palace in Amsterdam as the abdication and automatic succession were broadcast live.

The crowds had gathered in Dam Square from early on Tuesday to see the new king and his wife, Queen Maxima, as they stepped out onto the balcony of the Royal Palace. Beatrix blinked back tears as she presented her son.

""Some moments ago I abdicated from the throne. I am happy and thankful to present to you your new king,"" said Beatrix, 75, who now takes the title of princess.

Wearing a sober purple dress, Beatrix signed the abdication document in front of the Dutch cabinet, Willem-Alexander and Maxima, who wore a pale rose-colored dress with a shimmery skirt and enormous bow on her left shoulder.

Willem-Alexander, a 46-year-old water management specialist, is expected to bring a less formal touch to the monarchy together with Maxima, a former investment banker from Argentina.

Beatrix chose to retire after 33 years in the role, following in the tradition of her mother and grandmother.

April 30, or Queen's day, is always a day for partying in the Netherlands, and this year's investiture has provided another excuse to celebrate at a time when plummeting house prices, rising unemployment and slumping consumer confidence have pushed the country into recession.

Amsterdam has been awash with orange, the royal color, for days. Houses were covered in bunting and flags and shop windows were stuffed with orange cakes, sweets, clothes and flowers.

Many people took Monday off work and started celebrating in earnest from Monday evening. Nearly a million people were expected to join the street party with dancing to bands and DJs, helping create a carnival atmosphere.

""He (Willem-Alexander) knows what is needed. He unites people. He has made it possible for the different generations to mingle more,"" said 40-year-old Margriet Dantuma, dressed in an orange skirt, as she joined others on the Amsterdam pavements putting out impromptu stalls of bric-a-brac for sale.

The royals are broadly popular, with 78 percent of Dutch in favour of the monarchy, up from 74 percent a year ago, according to an Ipsos poll.

But they have been stripped of their political influence and no longer appoint the mediator who conducts exploratory talks when forming government coalitions.

Britain's Prince Charles and Japan's Crown Princess Masako, who was making her first foreign trip since falling ill a decade ago, were among the visitors at the official investiture ceremony on Tuesday afternoon.

The royal family headed from the palace to the 600-year-old Nieuwe Kerk, or New Church, to watch the king swear an oath to uphold the Dutch constitution.

The Dutch monarch is never crowned, since, in the absence of a state church, there is no cleric available to carry out the coronation. But there is a crown, which sat on a table next to him throughout the ceremony, along with other regalia that constitute the crown jewels.

Willem-Alexander wore a royal mantle that has been used for investitures since 1815, although it has been repaired and altered at least twice over the past century, for the investitures of his mother and grandmother.

At a time of austerity and billions of euros of budget cuts, the government promised to keep the cost of the pageantry down.

This week's ceremonies will cost about 12 million euros, but that excludes the bill for the extensive security measures.

45,45,FL-2013-000054-CHN,The rights and wrongs of Belo Monte - The Economist,https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2013/05/04/the-rights-and-wrongs-of-belo-monte,"THE biggest building site in Brazil is neither in the concrete jungle of São Paulo nor in beachside Rio de Janeiro, which is being revamped to host the 2016 Olympics. It lies 3,000km (1,900 miles) north in the state of Pará, deep in the Amazon basin. Some 20,000 labourers are working around the clock at Belo Monte on the Xingu river, the biggest hydropower plant under construction anywhere. When complete, its installed capacity, or theoretical maximum output, of 11,233MW will make it the world’s third-largest, behind China’s Three Gorges and Itaipu, on the border between Brazil and Paraguay.

Everything about Belo Monte is outsized, from the budget (28.9 billion reais, or $14.4 billion), to the earthworks—a Panama Canal-worth of soil and rock is being excavated—to the controversy surrounding it. In 2008 a public hearing in Altamira, the nearest town, saw a government engineer cut with a machete. In 2010 court orders threatened to stop the auction for the project. The private-sector bidders pulled out a week before. When officials from Norte Energia, the winning consortium of state-controlled firms and pension funds, left the auction room, they were greeted by protesters—and three tonnes of pig muck.

Since then construction has twice been halted briefly by legal challenges. Greens and Amerindians often stage protests. Xingu Vivo (“Living Xingu”), an anti-Belo Monte campaign group, displays notes from supporters all over the world in its Altamira office. James Cameron, a Hollywood film-maker, has chimed in to compare Brazil’s dam-builders to the villains in “Avatar”, one of his blockbusters.

But visit the site and Belo Monte now looks both unstoppable and much less damaging to the environment than some of its foes claim. The project has made it through Brazil’s labyrinth of planning and environmental rules. Norte Energia has hired a second consortium comprising a roll-call of Brazil’s big construction companies, which expects to finish work by 2019. Protected by a temporary cofferdam holding back the river’s flow, labourers are digging a 20km canal to funnel water from the river to the site of the main power plant, where dozens of excavators are digging down through 70 metres of rock.

The appeal of hydropower

With tens of millions of its citizens moving out of poverty, Brazil can satisfy demand only if it adds around 6,000MW each year for the next decade to its installed generating capacity of 121,000MW. It has plenty of choices. Apart from huge deposits of offshore oil and gas, Brazil has the world’s third-biggest hydropower potential (behind China and Russia), and its potential for solar and wind energy is probably among the three biggest, too. The world’s largest sugarcane crop provides bagasse, a fibrous residue which burns in high-pressure boilers. The country may also have shale gas. “Brazil is very lucky: it has many choices about how to expand its electricity supply,” says Claudio Sales of Acende Brasil, an energy-research institute. “But they are choices, and they need to be made.”

These choices will be watched closely elsewhere. In half a dozen other South American countries Brazil is planning joint dams or offering financing for hydropower projects. Countries in Africa and Asia are also looking to hydropower. Lenders such as the World Bank are once again keen.

Brazil’s energy ministry has ranked the various sources of energy according to availability, cheapness, renewability and whether Brazil has the necessary technology, says Altino Ventura, its secretary of planning and development. Hydropower comes top, followed by windpower and biomass (mostly bagasse). To spread risks, it decided to generate 50% of new supply from hydropower, 30% from wind and biomass, and most of the rest from gas.

Brazil already generates 80% of its electricity from hydro plants—far more than other countries. But two-thirds of its hydro potential is untapped. The snag is that most of it lies in untouched rivers in the Amazon basin. Of 48 planned dams, 30 are in the rainforest (see map). They include the almost completed Jirau and Santo Antônio on the Madeira river, which will add 6,600MW to installed capacity. But it is Belo Monte, the giant among them, that has become the prime target of anti-dams campaigners. Opponents say that dams only look cheap because the impact on locals is downplayed and the value of other uses of rivers—for fishing, transport and biodiversity—is not counted. They acknowledge that hydropower is low-carbon, but worry that reservoirs in tropical regions can release large amounts of methane, a much more powerful greenhouse gas. In the 20th century thousands of dams were built around the world. Some were disasters: Brazil’s Balbina dam near Manaus, put up in the 1980s, flooded 2,400 square km (930 square miles) of rainforest for a piffling capacity of 250MW. Its vast, stagnant reservoir makes it a “methane factory”, says Philip Fearnside of the National Institute for Amazonian Research, a government body in Manaus. Proportionate to output, it emits far more greenhouse gases than even the most inefficient coal plant. But many dams were worth it (though the losers rarely received fair compensation). Itaipu, built in the 1970s by Brazil’s military government, destroyed some of the world’s loveliest waterfalls, flooded 1,350 square km and displaced 10,000 families. But it now supplies 17% of Brazil’s electricity and 73% of Paraguay’s. It is highly efficient, producing more energy than the Three Gorges, despite being smaller.

Of Brazil’s total untapped hydropower potential of around 180,000MW, about 80,000MW lies in protected regions, mostly indigenous territories, for which there are no development plans. The government expects to use most of the remaining 100,000MW by 2030, says Mr Ventura. But it will minimise the social and environmental costs, he insists. The new dams will use “run of river” designs, eschewing large reservoirs and relying on the water’s natural flow to power the turbines. And they will not flood any Indian reserves.

That approach is being pioneered at Belo Monte. In the 1970s the military government dreamed of a sequence of five dams and huge reservoirs on the Xingu, which would have generated 20,000MW by displacing tens of thousands of people and flooding 18,000 square km, including Indian reserves. In all, it planned to flood 2% of the rainforest for reservoirs.

With democracy restored, the government ordered a rethink. The new plan for the Xingu involves just one dam complex, at the Volta Grande (“Big Bend”), where the river descends 93 metres in 140km—a large drop for Amazonia. Instead of from a reservoir, most of the water to drive the turbines will come by channelling part of the river’s flow through a new canal, from Pimental to the main generating station.

That added more than 2 billion reais to the project’s cost, but it avoids flooding Indian lands. Belo Monte will flood only 500 square km, mainly at the canal, according to Henrique di Lello Filho of the construction consortium. This area was already largely deforested by the building of the Transamazon Highway in the 1970s. Methane emissions should be small. Only 200 Amerindians will be directly affected (by the loss of fishing grounds).

Norte Energia has set aside 3.9 billion reais for mitigation and compensation payments. The constructors must build fish ladders, a boat-hoist to keep the river navigable, homes for 8,000 families (including 700 living in flood-prone palafitas, or wooden huts on stilts, by the riverside in Altamira), schools and health-care facilities, sewage connections and much more.

For activists in Altamira and some local Indians, this is not enough. They reject the project’s impact on the life of the town, where the population has swollen to 100,000, raising rents and putting pressure on health services and schools. Xingu Vivo claims the cofferdam at Pimental has turned the river below it into stagnant pools of dead fish; it says neither the boat hoist nor the fish ladder will work.

More heat than light

Most of the Indian protesters live in villages several days upstream by voadeira (fast launch), and will not be directly affected by Belo Monte. But they say they feel threatened by it. Asked if any hydropower project on the Xingu could be acceptable, Juma Xipaia, who now lives in Altamira, replies: “No. It is impossible. For us, the water is everything.” Nevertheless, a recent poll of 1,222 Amerindians from 20 tribes across the country found that most wanted the same things as other Brazilians: better health care and education, sanitation and electricity, more income and jobs.

The protesters’ legal challenge to Belo Monte is based on the claim that they have not been properly consulted, something the government denies. The constitution says that before exploiting any resource on Amerindian lands, the government must consult the inhabitants. But it is silent on how this should be done. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has a similar clause in its Convention 169 on indigenous rights, to which Brazil is a signatory.

The government says that since no demarcated territories will be flooded, such formal protections do not apply. “We hold consultations about the projects we’re doing not because we have to, but because it is right,” says Mr Ventura. Between 2007 and 2010 there were four public hearings and 12 public consultations about Belo Monte, as well as explanatory workshops and 30 visits to Indian villages.

In 2011, in response to a complaint filed by Indian groups, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights called for a halt to construction pending further consultation. That was “precipitate and unjustified”, said the government, refusing the request. The ILO has asked Brazil’s government for more information on how it intends to fulfil its legal obligations.

The legal uncertainty surrounding Belo Monte is bad for both the Indians and contractors, says Mr Sales—not to mention Brazil as a whole. A draft law detailing how to consult indigenous people is expected by the end of the year. But before Congress legislates, ground is likely to have been broken on most of the new dams.

Run-of-river hydropower has a much smaller environmental impact than big reservoirs. But it is also less efficient. Belo Monte is an extreme example. The Xingu’s highly seasonal flow means it will produce just 4,500MW on average, only 40% of its installed capacity. In the two driest months it will barely produce 1,000MW.

As run-of-river projects proliferate, generation will increasingly be at the mercy of rainfall. After successive dry years, in 2001-02 Brazilians lived through an apagão (“big blackout”), when electricity was rationed, hitting the economy hard. To prevent a repeat, the government commissioned thermal-power plants, fuelled by oil, coal and gas. They now make up a sixth of Brazil’s total installed capacity, and supply around a tenth of its electricity.

But rising demand and the declining proportion of reservoirs mean this is no longer enough. “The capacity to store energy—that is, water—is now small for the size of the system,” says Mauricio Tolmasquim of the Energy Research Agency, an arm of the energy ministry. “The country has started to run risks.” A lack of rain meant that Brazil’s reservoirs finished last year at just 30.5% of capacity, lower even than in the run-up to the apagão. This year the rains were more abundant; even so the national-grid operator has kept the thermal plants on right through the rainy season. That is costly: plants intended for irregular use are generally inefficient, and buying fuel at short notice is expensive. But the reservoirs must be kept as full as possible for 2014, when Brazil will host the football World Cup. A repeat of the apagão then would bring national humiliation.

Reservoirs or gas?

In the longer term Brazil plans to increase reliability by building more gas-powered plants, to be run permanently. An auction of up to five promising areas for shale gas is planned for December. “In about three years we’ll have a clearer idea of the role non-conventional gas can play,” says Mr Tolmasquim. “But from whatever source, thermal power is going to have to grow to at least 20% of our supply. The only other option would be more big reservoirs.”

This would be a better option, argue some energy experts. Antonio Dias Leite, a minister of mines and energy during the military government, thinks that run-of-river hydropower constitutes an unjustifiable waste of energy. “It’s strange the way people protest against reservoirs and not against gas-powered plants,” he says. “I think there is still an argument for building some big reservoirs, chosen prudently.”

Some greens argue that the choice between reservoirs and gas is a false one. Reducing transmission losses and modernising older hydropower plants would cut the need for both, says Célio Bermann, a hydropower specialist at the University of São Paulo. He thinks the rest of the gap could be filled with sugarcane bagasse—20,000MW could be added quickly—and windpower. Conveniently, the winds in Brazil’s north-east, where many wind farms are being installed, are strongest during the dry season, when hydro output falls. Current plans involve using only a small fraction of Brazil’s potential windpower of 143,000MW.

Such disagreements are best settled by estimating costs accurately. Brazil’s institutions are ill-suited to this. Planning and environmental laws are Byzantine: getting licences and fighting legal challenges routinely adds years to schedules and billions to budgets. The result is more like an obstacle course than a cost-benefit analysis. The environment ministry and regulator play almost no part in deciding which projects go ahead: their main role is harm-reduction after the energy ministry has decided what to do. Both have seen bosses resign rather than sign up to infrastructure projects in the Amazon. These failures mean that the most important question—whether Belo Monte is really cheaper than the alternatives—has never been satisfactorily answered.

Recent windpower auctions, with hundreds of private-sector bidders, produced winning bids of 90-100 reais per megawatt-hour (MWh), a price that is hard to beat. Belo Monte was given an initial budget of 16 billion reais, which had risen to 19 billion reais by the time of the auction. Norte Energia’s winning bid for Belo Monte offered a price of 77.97 reais/MWh. Since then, its budget has risen by a third.

Officials insist that the costs are Norte Energia’s problem. That looks disingenuous. The group is almost wholly state-owned. In November, the national development bank gave Norte Energia a loan of 22.5 billion reais—its largest-ever credit. If Belo Monte turns out to be a white elephant, the bill will fall on the taxpayer.","Sat, 04 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.economist.com/img/b/595/335/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20130504_AMP003_0.jpg,"['river', 'hydropower', 'wrongs', 'belo', 'monte', 'xingu', 'capacity', 'brazils', 'energy', 'rights', 'reservoirs', 'brazil']",

At a ceremony in Fangchenggang city, Liu Ancheng, head of the ministry's criminal investigation department, urged the two countries to boost cooperation to stop human trafficking.

The abducted baby boys were in poor health and suffered from pneumonia and other diseases when they were rescued by Chinese police on July 15, 2011, according to a notice released on the ministry's website.

One infant was unconscious because the human traffickers gave him sleeping pills to stop him from crying, it said.

The children - from 10 days old to seven months old when they were rescued - received medical treatment and promptly recovered, it said.

Chinese police informed their Vietnamese counterparts of the children's situation and asked them to check their identities and find their parents - partly the reason why the children were handed over more than a year after being rescued.

Before the handover on Friday, some of the children were living in a welfare institution, while others were with foster families in Fangchenggang.

Police from Guangxi and Guangdong also arrested 43 suspects, including 10 from Vietnam, in the joint action.

Some months before the operation, police from Fangchenggang were tipped off that a criminal gang was smuggling children from Vietnam and selling them to places including Shanwei and Jieyang in neighboring Guangdong province.

Liu, at the Ministry of Public Security, said the criminal gang was experienced and organized, made use of the complex geographic conditions of the border area in Guangxi, and that its members were assigned specific tasks.

The difficult terrain near the Beilun River, the cross-border river, has made human trafficking possible as smugglers are able to avoid checkpoints at the border by using countryside roads at night, Liu was quoted by China Central Television as saying.

He said the criminal suspects in Vietnam ""used flashlights and body language at the border to communicate with their associates who came to pick up the babies instead of using phones"".

It remains unclear whether the suspects have been sentenced.

According to data released by the Ministry of Public Security, Chinese police have rescued 1,804 trafficked women and 41 children from Vietnam since 2009.

Chen Wei, a lawyer from the Beijing Yingke Law Firm, urged the Chinese government to stop granting buyers immunity from prosecution to eliminate human trafficking.

Chinese law stipulates that whoever buys an abducted woman or child can face a sentence of up to three years in prison, but adds that buyers who neither obstruct the police's rescue actions nor abuse the child can be exempted from prosecution.

""Cracking down on buyers is the key to eliminate human trafficking,"" Chen stressed, adding that the government should also tighten up patrols at the border.","Sat, 04 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20130503/180373d2873012ee389307.jpg,"['vietnam', 'handed', 'abducted', 'border', 'children', 'human', 'rescued', 'guangxi', 'suspects', 'security', 'criminal', 'stop']",

When Saddam Hussein's regime collapsed, it appeared Iraq's once-abundant marshlands had been destroyed forever.The former president had transformed the largest wetland ecosystem in Southwest Asia into desert in retaliation for a Shi'ite uprising in the early 1990s.As a result, a 20,000-square-kilometer sanctuary for fish, migratory birds, and water buffalo was feared lost, along with the traditional way of life carried out for centuries by the inhabitants of the marshes, located between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers in southern Iraq.By the time Hussein was toppled in 2003, some 90 percent of Iraq's marshland had been drained. Leading experts provided a dire assessment, predicting that the marshes could never be restored.But local residents soon tore breaches in the earth dykes that Hussein had constructed, allowing water from the north to flow into the area again.Within six months, the reed forests began to return. Broader efforts to restore and monitor the marshes followed. As a result, according to the United Nations, more than 40 percent of southern Iraq's marshes have been regenerated.The return of wildlife highlights the positives, but questions remain about whether the lives of the marshland people can be fully restored.Hasan Ali was raised as a fisherman in Chibayish, where he lived with his parents in a traditional arched house made from marsh reeds and kept alive a centuries-old way of life.In the 1990s, he became one of 175,000 marshland Iraqis who were displaced by the Hussein regime's effort to drain the marshes.Their restoration has allowed Ali to return to take up his former trade as a fisherman, but it is not an easy transition for him and his family.""The situation has improved now [since the era of Hussein's rule]. But many who had been fishermen are not interested in returning because they think it is better to live and work in the cities,"" Ali says. ""They are no longer thinking about the marshes as the land of their fathers and grandfathers -- as a land for hunting and fishing and agriculture. Most of them have become accustomed to the city lifestyle and would rather live in the cities than return to the marshes.""But others are reestablishing their roots in the hope that they can make a living the way their ancestors did.Hasan Jum'a has built an arched reed house on a small, floating islet that he constructed from reeds, mud, and rushes -- much like ancient Mesopotamian marsh inhabitants built their homes.""We hope that the marshes will be completely restored to the way they were before because the Chibayish inhabitants depend on them for grass and fish,"" Jum'a says. ""Most of their livelihood comes from nature here and on the birds that come through for about two months every year. Without the marshes, there would be nothing to benefit the people here -- no water buffalo, no grass for livestock, no fish, and no birds.""In the Maysan marshes east of Chibayish, one woman tells RFE/RL that this year's record winter rainfall was a blessing.""The animals are now doing well. The fish have returned with the increase of water,"" she says. ""In Saddam's time, we really suffered. We were displaced and went through dire times. But now we can fish again. We have grass where we can take the animals out to graze. So we have come back and have settled down.""Dangerous threats remain to the ecosystem, however.Azzam Alwash is a marshland Iraqi who fled to the United States to escape Hussein’s crackdown in the 1990s. Trained as a civil engineer, he returned to Iraq in late 2003 and created a nongovernmental organization called Nature Iraq -- a group that is now warning about how upstream dams alter vital seasonal floods.""The floods made agriculture sustainable in Iraq for 7,000 years. Every year we'd have a new flood that comes in and renews life. And, in fact, we now have no floods,"" Alwash says. ""What we have is a constant stream of water that is reducing in quality and increasing in salinity. The reason for that is because dams are being built upstream in Iraq, in Syria, in Turkey, and Iran. We have to manage this place together. Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Syria need to work together across boundaries to manage the water resources of the Tigris and Euphrates. To share.""The process of returning water to Iraqi marshlands is being watched closely thanks to individuals like Alwash, oversight bodies such as the, and the Iraqi government.Iraq's deputy minister of agriculture, Mahdi al-Qaisi, says record rainfall last winter caused salinity to drop in recent months and bring a fresh, almost miraculous burst of plant growth and wildlife.""The more water that is introduced into the marshes, the lower the levels of salinity are in the water,"" he says. ""This allows life in the ecosystem to rebound within the wetlands.""Qaisi tells RFE/RL that the lower salinity levels have allowed the government to push ahead with regeneration projects.""We have started strategic plans to revive the marshes,"" he says. ""We are focused on restoring conditions that will help support water buffalo livestock because they are an economically important animal for marshland agriculture. We also consider the marshes as an important resource for fish -- and the [General Authority for the Development of Fisheries] has pushed to restock the marshes with small carp.""For those who have returned to the marshlands, the stakes are high.They say their livelihoods depend on the marshes providing enough to sustain their families. And they worry that any reversal in the restoration of the marshes, such as a rise in salinity that could kill fish, could mark the end of their return.","Sun, 05 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://gdb.rferl.org/0506CDE9-8FF3-46F0-A35B-02A3B7FFB52C_w1200_r1.jpg,"['restoring', 'agriculture', 'life', 'iraq', 'fish', 'traditional', 'return', 'marshlands', 'chibayish', 'way', 'iraqs', 'marshes', 'water', 'salinity', 'bloom', 'marshland']",

Liz Barron, 63, left exactly a century after her grandfather Lesie Pardoe left

Mr Pardoe was starting a new life as a deputy engineer in the Chinese city

Mrs Barron, and her husband Tony, are recreating his train route exactly

Route takes them across the channel, through Europe and into Russia

They then take the Trans-Siberian railway onto China

Whole journey should take Mr and Mrs Barron 24 days - if all goes to plan



A mother is following in the footsteps of her grandfather and setting off to China by train 100 years after he departed to the very minute.



Liz Barron, 63, and her husband Tony, 71, set off on their 6,000 mile journey from Barry, South Wales, to Shanghai last Saturday.



Her grandfather Leslie Pardoe, then a 21-year-old bachelor, left the town on April 20, 1913, to start a new life as a deputy engineer in Shanghai.

Two tickets to Shanghai! Mr and Mrs Barron stand on the platform at Barry station waiting for their first train as they embark on their epic journey to China last Saturday Their route: Liz Barron and her husband Tony have embarked on a 6,000 mile journey from Barry, south Walers, to Shanghai. The red arrow (right) shows the only point that their journey differs from Liz's grandfather's 100 years ago

Recreating his steps: Leslie Pardoe and his wife Margaret who he met while living in Shanghai. They are pictured here on their honeymoon in Japan in 1916

Destination: Shanghai's glittering high-rise skyline which has shot up in the last 20 years - and is unrecognisable from the city Mr Pardoe lived in 100 years ago

VIDEO Liz Barron fondly details plans for the Wales to China trip...

At the time there was a large expatriate community in the Chinese coastal city as it was used by the West as a trading port.

The British, the Americans and the French had all set up concession zones in the city which were not run under local law.



RECREATING HER GRANDFATHER'S ROUTE: HOW LIZ AND HER HUSBAND WILL GET TO SHANGHAI

Train from Barry, South Wales, to Cardiff

Train to London Paddington from Cardiff

Onward travel to Ramsgate where they will get the ferry to Ostend

Train to Moscow across central Europe via Brussels, Cologne, Berlin and Warsaw

Trans-Siberian railway from Moscow to Changchun, northern China

Overnight train from Changchun to Shanghai which passes through Beijing

The whole journey should take Liz 24 days while her grandfather managed it in just 15 - and he suffered a train derailment. However, Mrs Barron and her husband are stopping en route to do some sight-seeing.

The only major difference in the route is Mr Pardoe got a ferry from Dailen through the East China Sea to Shanghai. The service no longer runs, so Mrs Barron is doing the three-day journey in one night on a train.



As he headed off to the East a century ago, Mr Pardoe took the train first class to Moscow - for the princely sum of £10 7s 3d.

He then continued on his journey through Russia, Siberia and Manchuria before arriving in China after 15 days.

His grandaughter Liz and her husband started off outside his old redbrick home in Barry as they embarked on their epic £25,000 journey.



They boarded the 15.45 train at the local station - and copied Mr Pardoe by telling the guard: 'Two first class tickets to Shanghai please.'



The local train took them the short distance to Cardiff where they caught the First Great Western service to London Paddington.

In London they dined at the same Whitehall hotel as Mr Pardoe did a century ago before crossing the Channel from Ramsgate to Ostend.

Liz and Tony, who have five children and ten grandchildren between them, are now retracing his route across Europe to Moscow, via Brussels, Cologne, Berlin and Warsaw.

Unlike their forerunner, they will be taking short breaks in some of those cities before joining the Trans-Siberian Railway.

They will spend four nights on the train from Moscow to Listvyanka on Lake Baikal in Siberia. From there the Trans-Manchurian railway will take them via Harbin to Changchun in northern China.

Departure point: Liz and Tony leave from the same spot in Barry, south Wales that her grandfather Leslie left from

Departure point: Leslie Pardoe's former home in Barry, South Wales, which he left on April 20, 1913. Exactly 100 years later his granddaughter departed for Shanghai from outside the same property On their way: Recreating Mr Pardoe's journey, Liz and Tony walk down to the train station on the way to Shanghai from Barry, South Wales His departure: Leslie Pardoe (second from the right) on April 20, 1913, when he left for China.

First ticket: Liz and Tony buy their tickets for the half hour 10-mile journey to Cardiff as they embark on the first leg of their 6,000 mile journey On his way: A newspaper announcement about Leslie Pardoe's departure. He was presented with a coat, a book and a compass as a gift by the Local Government Officers' Association

Their route maps Liz's grandfather's journey as closely as possible - although a number of the railway lines have been replaced over the last century.

Only the last leg of their route differs significantly, as Mr Pardoe as he took a three-day ferry ride from Dalien in China to Shanghai.

The service is no longer available so Liz and Tony will instead take an overnight sleeper train from Changchun - finally arriving in Shanghai on May 14.

They plan to spend a week in Shanghai visiting some of the places associated with Mr Pardoe who lived in the Far Eastern port for 27 years.

Ready to go: Liz and Tony's first train arrives at Barry train station last Saturday to take them to Cardiff on the first leg of their journey

Farewell: Mrs Barron and her husband wave goodbye to relatives at the station as they head to Cardiff - and on to Shanghai

He met Liz's grandmother Margaret in Shanghai and married her in 1916 and they had four children. Liz's father John was the youngest of their three sons.

Mr Pardoe left Shanghai for good in 1940 when the Japanese took over the city and escaped back to England via Canada.

After the war, China turned Communist in a revolution in 1949.



Mr Pardoe died in 1965 - but left detailed notes and photographs of his epic journey.

They have been handed to Liz so she could faithfully recreate the journey.



Liz, a childrens' author and former county councillor, said: 'As a little girl I was fascinated with all the Chinese artefacts in my grandma's house.

'One day grandpa's diary turned up and I decided that I had to follow what he'd done.

'I then realised we were close to the 100-year anniversary of his trip and everything fell into place.

'We're even starting from his old house in Barry - with the current owner's permission - and following grandpa as closely as possible.

'He kept a diary, written in pencil on 25 loose sheets of paper, so we have a pretty good idea of where he went.

'He travelled with four other young men and went the entire way by first class, which was a major achievement all those years ago.

'His train de-railed just outside Moscow - where the line had only been completed around 15 years earlier - but it was repaired within seven hours.

'It really was a remarkable adventure and the start of a very eventful life in Shanghai.'

Liz and Tony, from Southampton, will travel virtually all the way by first class train, and will shun the grim Chinese hard seat carriages in favour of the more luxurious sleepers.



Tony, a quantity surveyor, said: 'We are expecting to face some challenges on this trip.

'But I'm sure my experiences of travelling on other trains around the world when I was working abroad will not be repeated.

'They were often overcrowded with families, their baggage and their animals and were hot, smelly and uncomfortable.

'We are not faint-hearted but that would be a step too far.'

The couple plan to spent another three weeks touring China and another visiting relatives in Hong Kong before returning home at the beginning of June.

Their seven-week holiday has taken 11 months to plan with train operators First Great Western providing them with free first class return tickets to Paddington.

The last time there was this much carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere, modern humans didn't exist. Megatoothed sharks prowled the oceans, the world's seas were up to 100 feet higher than they are today, and the global average surface temperature was up to 11°F warmer than it is now.

As we near the record for the highest CO2 concentration in human history — 400 parts per million — climate scientists worry about where we were then, and where we're rapidly headed now.

According to data gathered at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, the 400 ppm mark may briefly be exceeded this month, when CO2 typically hits a seasonal peak in the Northern Hemisphere, although it is more likely to take a couple more years until it stays above that threshold, according to Ralph Keeling, a researcher at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography.

CO2 levels are far higher now than they have been for anytime during the past 800,000 years.

Keeling is the son of Charles David Keeling, who began the CO2 observations at Mauna Loa in 1958 and for whom the iconic “Keeling Curve” is named.

Carbon dioxide is the most important long-lived global warming gas, and once it is emitted by burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil, a single CO2 molecule can remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. Global CO2 emissions reached a record high of 35.6 billion tonnes in 2012, up 2.6 percent from 2011. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases warm the planet by absorbing the sun’s energy and preventing heat from escaping back into space.

The news that CO2 is near 400 ppm for the first time highlights a question that scientists have been investigating using a variety of methods: when was the last time that CO2 levels were this high, and what was the climate like back then?

There is no single, agreed-upon answer to those questions as studies show a wide date range from between 800,000 to 15 million years ago. The most direct evidence comes from tiny bubbles of ancient air trapped in the vast ice sheets of Antarctica. By drilling for ice cores and analyzing the air bubbles, scientists have found that, at no point during at least the past 800,000 years have atmospheric CO2 levels been as high as they are now.

That means that in the entire history of human civilization, CO2 levels have never been this high.

Other research, though, shows that you have to go back much farther in time, well beyond 800,000 years ago, to find an instance where CO2 was sustained at 400 ppm or greater.

For a 2009 study, published in the journal Science, scientists analyzed shells in deep sea sediments to estimate past CO2 levels, and found that CO2 levels have not been as high as they are now for at least the past 10 to 15 million years, during the Miocene epoch.

“This was a time when global temperatures were substantially warmer than today, and there was very little ice around anywhere on the planet. And so sea level was considerably higher — around 100 feet higher — than it is today,” said Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann, in an email conversation. “It is for this reason that some climate scientists, like James Hansen, have argued that even current-day CO2 levels are too high. There is the possibility that we’ve already breached the threshold of truly dangerous human influence on our climate and planet.”

Sea levels are increasing today in response to the warming climate, as ice sheets melt and seas expand due to rising temperatures. Scientists are projecting up to 3 feet or more of global sea level rise by 2100, which would put some coastal cities in peril.

While there have been past periods in Earth's history when temperatures were warmer than they are now, the rate of change that is currently taking place is faster than most of the climate shifts that have occurred in the past, and therefore it will likely be more difficult to adapt to.

A 2011 study in the journal Paleoceanography found that atmospheric CO2 levels may have been comparable to today’s as recently as sometime between 2 and 4.6 million years ago, during the Pliocene epoch, which saw the arrival of Homo habilis, a possible ancestor of modern homo sapiens, and when herds of giant, elephant-like Mastadons roamed North America. Modern human civilization didn’t arrive on the scene until the Holocene Epoch, which began 12,000 years ago.

Regardless of which estimate is correct, it is clear that CO2 levels are now higher than they have ever been in mankind’s history. With global CO2 emissions continuing on an upward trajectory that is likely to put CO2 concentrations above 450 ppm or higher, it is extremely unlikely that the steadily rising shape of the Keeling Curve is going to change anytime soon.

“There's an esthetic to the curve that's beautiful science and troubling reality,” Keeling said. “I'd very much like to see the curve change from going steadily upward to flattening out.”

Frank Lautenberg that would require background checks on purchases of explosive materials and a permit to build homemade explosives. This bill illuminates the fact that, as of now, explosive powders, such those that were used in the Boston Marathon bombing, can be purchased easily and in large quantities (up to 50 pounds, to be exact) without a background check. If that sounds crazy to some, there are many others who say they depend on explosives for their (entirely legal) livelihoods. They include:

Dynamite and other explosives are used to demolish beaver dams that can flood farms and kill off other rodents, while ammonium nitrate—which is currently being investigated as the cause of the West, Texas, explosion that killed 14 people earlier this month—is inexpensive and commonly used as fertilizer. Farmers may also use explosives to loosen soil or break up boulders and tree stumps that get in the way of sowing crops.

The Pyrotechnicians Who Put on July 4th Displays

From action films and rock concerts to the Super Bowl and the Fourth of July fireworks display, pyrotechnics and the experts who handle them have long been an integral part of American entertainment. Fireworks and other special effects require the use of what’s known as “low explosives,” such as black powder, that do not detonate with a shock, but rather deflagrate, releasing a large amount of heated gas.

The Construction Guys Who Built Your Office

Dynamite, blasting caps, and other types of so-called “high explosives” are often the most effective tool for demolishing anything from bridges and entire buildings to chimneys and towers at the start of a new construction project.

The People Who Police Your Streets

Exploding targets are a popular training tool, whether shooting is your job (police officer? soldier?) or simply a hobby. The key components of these targets, usually a fuel, like aluminum, and an oxidizer, such as ammonium nitrate, are only considered explosives once they are combined. So companies like Tannerite or Sure Shot avoid ATF regulations by selling the targets as make-at-home kits, with the ingredients packaged separately.

Mining is the primary use of explosives in the United States, with Kentucky, Wyoming, Virginia, Indiana, and West Virginia accounting for more than half of all the country’s explosive sales.

“My dad, Victor Javier, was the mayor of the then Municipality of Navotas in the 1980s. He passed on in 2000. We were sheltered from politics as we grew up. It was not even clear to us what a mayor was back then,” said Patrick Joseph “PJ” Javier, 36, a doctor by profession.

Even from his sick bed, Javier’s father had advised not to enter politics.

To him, it sounded like one of his father’s last reminders before he died.

“I understand that there will come a time when you will be called on to serve our city, our nation. If you believe you have something to give, then go for it. But once you feel that you’ve given all you’ve got, get out because once you make politics a living, that will be the end of you,” he said.

Javier graduated with a medicine degree from the University of the East-Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center in 2003, while taking up law at Ateneo University. His calling came in 2004.

“I was at the crossroads of my life, and was surprised when community leaders went to my mom and asked her if someone from our family could run. They specifically asked for me, which was a surprise, as I was a quiet person then,” he said.

Javier ran as vice mayor in that year’s elections, and is now winding up his third term.

Should he win the mayoralty race, Javier is hoping to focus on areas which, he said, were not priorities in the city government’s programs in the last three years.

“I believe we need to prioritize areas such as education, health, and flood control. For a start, we need to realign funds to those sectors. We had many beautification programs. But what will you do with those programs if our constituents will have to evacuate because of the floods?” Javier said.

“Basically, our world stops when it floods. There is no flow of trade and goods, no classes, no businesses. How can we attract businesses when the environment is not ideal?” he said.

Javier said it was logical that he run for mayor so he can fulfill his dreams for the second-smallest local government unit in Metro Manila, next to Pateros.

“After the advice my father gave when he was dying, I kept asking myself, ‘Do I still have something to give to this city? Can I still help?’ he said. “So far, my answer to that question is yes. I still have more to give.”

It is, for me, an honour and a special privilege to have been invited to deliver this year’s Lawrence Dana Pinkham Memorial Lecture at the annual convocation of the Asian College of Journalism. This is not only because of the illustrious list of scholars and practitioners of journalism who have preceded me in this role. It is also because of the close association I have had, and continue to have, with this College ever since its conception and through its subsequent planning, creation and growth into the leading journalism school in this part of the world. But above all, I deem it a privilege to be delivering this lecture because in the course of my association with the Asian College of Journalism I was able to, on more than one occasion, meet with Professor Lawrence Pinkham, hear his views on journalism and journalism education, and of his experiences in the US, China and elsewhere while spreading the message of good and principled journalism, what a good journalist should strive to do and how to do it. That knowledge and experience, which the management of the Media Development Foundation chose to exploit by consulting with Professor Pinkham and persuading him to be, first, a distinguished Visiting Professor and then Dean of this College, played an important role in making ACJ what it is today. As for me, much of the little I know about journalism as a profession and journalism education, I learnt through those encounters, which included discussions with other stalwarts in the field like Mr. Sashi Kumar and Mr. N. Ram.

I am thankful to them for having given me that opportunity, and for being among those who invited me to deliver this lecture. As a tribute to Professor Lawrence Pinkham and in deference to the concerns of those of you who are passing out of this College today, and despite the daunting presence of the distinguished Trustees of the MDF, the accomplished faculty of the ACJ and other senior professionals with much knowledge, I decided that I shall carry my baggage as an economist and stray into the world of ‘news as business’ in this age of the Internet.

The Internet and news

That the Internet has changed the way news is gathered, processed and delivered can no longer be denied. But a question that is increasingly posed is whether news as business is fundamentally threatened, as a result, or, as some argue, if print and traditional television as means to deliver news are in a state of terminal decline.

Across the world, with some exceptions like India, the steep fall in circulation figures and advertising revenues for print journalism has supported the latter surmise. The decision of Newsweek magazine to stop publishing its print edition after nearly 80 years of presence, and to go only digital on a subscription platform as of this year, seems to confirm this assessment. The words, after the closure, from Tina Brown, editor-in-chief of Newsweek and the online-only The Daily Beast, were also a form of corroboration. “When I returned to print with Newsweek, it did very quickly begin to feel to me an outmoded medium. While I still had a great romance for it, nonetheless I feel this is not the right medium any more to produce journalism,” Brown reportedly said. Clearly, the digital revolution is fundamentally transforming news as business. So much so that, while the old model is breaking down, there is no clear alternative in sight.

This is of immense significance because the news industry, warts and all, is seen as central to democracy. Is this, then, merely a time of transition and can we expect to soon have a new model in place? Or are we at a tipping point beyond which the way news is purveyed and accessed will be fundamentally altered? If so, what could be the nature of the news business of the future? Not enough has happened to discern a clear answer to these questions. To quote news industry analyst Ken Doctor: “Anything you think you know about our digitally disrupted media future may be wrong; early in this revolution, we’re all reminded to be humble.” I will, therefore, merely focus on some possible implications of trends that matter and the directions they point to. Given the constraints of time and my competence, I shall stay largely with the impact of the Internet on the print business. Further, much of what I say will be based on global trends. But there is no doubt that with technology being triggered, those trends reflect our own future.

We now take for granted the transformation of the processes of collection, collation, storage and processing of information made possible by the digital revolution. The long-term consequences of that transformation is an issue on which much has been written based on fact, and a lot more said and written based on speculation and wishful thinking. But, underlying all that is the recognition that, in ways that are obvious and perceptible, the combination of increases in computing power, advances in communication and sheer human ingenuity have indeed brought about dramatic changes. The challenge is of course not just to the news business. In the realms of book publishing, music and film, for example, the way in which content is produced and delivered to the reader, listener and viewer has changed and is changing dramatically. This poses challenges to traditional businesses engaged in the production, marketing and distribution of these sources of information and entertainment. The physical forms—ink-and-paper books, CDs, DVDs—in which these services (such as telling a story, playing music, purveying information and analysis, or making and showing a movie) are embodied to make them products that can be sold off shelves, are disappearing. As a result, the physical wholesale and retail outlets that stock and sell these services packaged as products are also disappearing as ‘download’ becomes the mode of delivery and/or consumption.

In areas such as the book, music or film business, the challenge seems manageable. It can be met by reorganising the industry to deliver services in new forms and pricing them appropriately to retain a market. It also involves exploiting niche strengths that permit charging an adequate price or fee for old-style physical delivery in the face of competition from the Internet. The challenge is manageable because these are, in the first instance, products marketed at a price that is meant to cover costs and deliver a profit. What the digital revolution has done is to change the way in which outputs are produced and, more importantly, sold. The brick-and-mortar distribution business may be challenged, but the industry is not. The danger to the business if any comes from an older threat-piracy-through which a growing number of consumers or clients can access for free, a paid product or service. This, however, is a problem that has existed ever since cheap reproduction became possible, as was true with cassettes, say. What the Internet has done, through services like BitTorrent, is to allow this practice to go viral, thereby challenging the industry’s profits, even if not its existence. But big business seems to have even that under control now.

The newspaper business

The problem, on the other hand, in the business of collecting, collating and reporting news, and offering long-form news analysis, is that its costs are not covered by the prices charged—whether it be in print or in television. It is not just newspaper profits but newspaper production costs-newsprint, industrial (printing, shipping, delivery) and editorial costs-that are covered by revenues from advertising. Based on data from 17 representative newspaper companies, the Newspaper Association of America (NAA) estimated that in 2012, circulation revenues accounted for only 27 per cent of total newspaper media revenue, whereas print advertising delivered as much as 46 per cent, despite its long-term decline relative to advertising in competing media. The balance came from non-traditional sources such as digital marketing, promotional events and niche publishing.

Despite the dominance of advertising revenues, circulation matters, because advertising dollars or rupees are linked to the numbers and profile of the audience of any potential vehicle for advertising. This makes the news business quite unusual.

Whereas newspapers and magazines claim to cater to their readers, the reader is not typically a consumer in the conventional sense since advertisers are the ones who pay to cover most costs and returns. The reader is partly the product delivered to the advertiser in the news business model evolved by capitalism in all relevant contexts.

This, as we know, influences content-in more ways than one. If the focus is on profit, what matters is readership and circulation. In the resulting race for numbers, content can be dumbed down in the name of giving readers what they want. It can also be manipulated to suit corporate advertisers. In the process, what N. Ram identifies as the twin roles of providing credible information and adopting a critical, investigative and even adversarial stance vis-à-vis the state and corporate capital can be compromised. The more one or more newspapers in a given market adopt this stance, the greater is the pressure on others to follow. Some no doubt hold out, to their credit. But their number is small.

Further, since the evidence suggests that the responsiveness of circulation figures to price cuts — what economists term the elasticity of circulation with respect to price — is low in the news industry, there have been instances where large price reductions have been resorted to with the objective of boosting circulation. Such cuts have to be partially or wholly met by competitors if they are to stay in the business. The resulting price war can have two consequences. First, since only the larger players with deep pockets can survive such a war without much difficulty, there emerges a tendency towards consolidation, which is not good for content even if it is for profits. Second, with circulation revenues down, there is even greater dependence on advertising revenues. The adverse effect is cumulative.

The case against regulation

Thus, the business model in the news industry has two tendencies built into it: a threat to quality and the danger of consolidation, which has its feedback effects. This does have implications for the media’s role as the Fourth Estate, monitoring government and being an important part of the ‘checks-and-balances’ mechanism that sustains democracy. Corporate control implies that the press is not an independent agency representing the public interest. And when such control is in the hands of a monopoly or oligopoly, sectional influences are strong, and the reader’s choice (as consumer) with regard to content and stance is limited and almost left to chance. In other circumstances this would provide a case for state regulation and even ownership. But that is unacceptable with respect to the news business in a democracy, which needs a ‘free press’, however hobbled that may be by corporate influence.

To quote media practitioner and analyst Sashi Kumar: “The temptation to fix the media through an external regulatory authority may well seem a fashionable urge, much in the same vein as caricaturing and debunking politics is the hobby-horse of a section of the middle class. But it could mean a dangerous departure from the long nurtured and cherished principle of the freedom of the press as the sine qua non of our democracy. Inasmuch as the Fourth Estate constitutes the fourth pillar of democracy and is therefore, by implication and extension, as relevant as the three other pillars (the Executive, the Judiciary and the Legislature) in terms of the ‘checks and balances’ aspect of the principle of the separation of powers envisaged by the Constitution, any administrative tampering with it can have serious consequences for the larger democratic project itself.”

If public intervention is unacceptable, the news business must both regulate itself and address its own challenges including that faced by the newspaper industry in the age of the Internet. That challenge now appears daunting. Across the world, although with some exceptions including India, newspapers and magazines have experienced a steep decline in circulation numbers and advertising revenues.

Back in 2010, an OECD study7 found that the annual growth of global newspaper circulation, which was slowing since 2004, reached zero in 2007 and then turned negative. Relative to 2004, circulation had by 2010 fallen by 34 per cent in the United States, 22 per cent in the United Kingdom, and 18 per cent in Japan. Matters have only worsened since. In the US, in particular, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, paid weekday newspaper circulation peaked at 63.1 million in 1973, fluctuated in the 60–63 million range till 1990, then fell sharply to 50.7 million in 2007 and further to 44.4 million in 2011.

The drop in print circulation was due to larger numbers accessing news from other sources. The first shift was to television. But the substantial difference in the way news is purveyed through that medium made this more of an opportunity than a challenge. If newspapers could restructure themselves to provide the background and analysis to the events and developments captured by television’s immediacy, those whose interest was triggered by television news would turn to print. This did indeed happen in many contexts. The problem arose when both news and analysis of varying authenticity began to be made available by multiple providers through the Internet.

The importance of this alternative source of news and analysis depends of course on the spread, ease, speed and cost of access to the Internet. The digital promise lies in the fact that the world over, the pace at which universal access to high-speed connectivity is being realised, though slower than what was expected by those whom Robert McChesney9 calls the ‘celebrants’ of the Internet, is definitely much faster than predicted by the ‘sceptics’. Though not the leader in this area, the United States is one country where access has indeed spread significantly, even if at a cost. As a result, the US is often the benchmark for assessing Internet impact, in the sense of offering the less-connected an image of their future.

The US example

The news from there for the news business is not good. According to the Pew Research Center’s 2012 News Media Consumption survey, 39 per cent of respondents reported accessing news online or from a mobile device the day before they were canvassed. When combined with other online and digital news sources, the share of people who got news from one or more digital forms on an average day rose to 50 per cent. That came close to the audience for television news, and was well ahead of the figures for print newspapers and radio (29 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively). Even if accessing news is still a habit, the newspaper is clearly far less so.

The drop in circulation and the competition from the Internet for advertising dollars have in turn adversely affected print advertising revenues. According to UK’s Offcom, between 2007 and 2011, global newspaper and magazine advertising revenues declined at a compound annual rate of close to 7 per cent each, to reach £60 billion and £28 billion respectively.11 On the other hand, expenditure on all Internet advertising grew at a compound annual rate of 16 per cent, to touch £48 billion, or more than 50 per cent of advertising value in print editions of newspapers and magazine. Moreover, since only a small part of the Internet advertising revenue accrued to online editions of newspapers, it was inadequate to neutralise the loss in print. In the US, for example, print advertising revenue fell from a peak of $48.7 billion in 2000 to $18.9 billion in 2012: a fall of $29.7 billion or 61 per cent (without counting for inflation). Online newspaper advertising revenues, on the other hand, rose from a meagre $1.2 billion in 2003 to a paltry $3.4 billion in 2012. The trend seems relentless. There were only four years out of thirteen since 2000, in which print advertising revenue growth was positive, and in the crisis years of 2008 and 2009, the decline was as large as 17.7 and 28.6 per cent.

Turn to the Internet

Given the newspaper industry’s revenue structure, the conclusion must be that the sharp decline in advertising revenues is destroying the current revenue model. This is a crisis of the news business under capitalism, and not a crisis of the news industry as a result of a technological meteor called the Internet. Yet, the drive now is to find a new form for the news business, geared towards private profit. If looked at in terms of the opportunities offered by audience behavior, the appropriate strategy would seem to be an increasing emphasis on online news, repackaged to attract a larger share of netizens. The newspaper industry, which had for long considered the Internet a poor, if not inappropriate, medium to carry its editorial content, and a mere add-on to direct traffic towards print, is being forced to rethink. But going online too does not seem to be a solution to the problem, for a number of reasons.

The first is that it does not resolve the cost–price discrepancy that characterises the industry, with unit price falling far short of unit cost. As of now, online editions and news websites for print news enterprises are not substitutes but add-ons. So, there are only additional costs to be incurred when going online and no saving. But if the move, as in the case of Newsweek, is away from print to the web, some saving is inevitable. In the case of print, for example, one estimate suggests that costs can be divided into core promotional, editorial and administrative costs, amounting to 40 per cent of the total, and production and distribution costs that account for 60 per cent. The shift to the web is expected to cut production and distribution costs by at least half.

However, this does not go far enough. As of now, costs are seen as absorbing close to 90 per cent of revenues in successful news ventures. But only about a quarter of those revenues comes from sales; the remaining comes from non- circulation revenues, principally advertising. A small percentage, or virtually nothing, comes from online presence. So, even an online news venture that is substituting for declining print circulation and revenues must draw substantial advertising revenues. This is where the catch lies. Though advertising through the Internet has grown rapidly, news sites are not important vehicles for advertisers. Technology companies—such as Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and AOL—dominate the digital advertising market, taking as much as two-thirds of the total. That leaves little for print providers seeking to increasingly move online.

The paywall rush

Hence the drive to monetise the web, by creating metered or full-fledged paywalls. All of a sudden, online editions are being seen as potential sources of subscription revenue to support the industry. The practice of setting up paywalls for access to online editions, which was earlier restricted to a few newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal and Financial Times, and then adopted by some general interest papers such as The Times and The New York Times, is spreading fast. By late last year, around 250 out of 1,500 newspapers in the US, accounting for a third of newspaper readership, had opted for a paywall.14 The most recent adopters of the practice include The Washington Post, The Orange County Register, The Telegraph, The San Francisco Chronicle and The Sun. Most of these have set up metered paywalls offering free access to a specified number of articles or for a limited time period before the meter starts ticking. Pricing in most cases is aimed at transiting readers to a pay regime and is set at less than the price of the print edition per Day-and print subscribers are often given free or discounted access to transit to the web.15 Further, many newspapers allow free access to those visiting their online edition through links on search engines or the social media to boost their online traffic. All in all, however, the effort to charge for access to online content is gathering momentum. Once that practice becomes standard, the expectation seems to be that prices can be suitably adjusted.

The idea, clearly, is to make news pay for itself to the maximum extent possible. There is strong evidence to show that in print, those looking for quality reportage and news analysis are not too responsive to price. But online editions attract many occasional visitors who are discouraged by a pay model. Not surprisingly, a 2012 Paid Content Benchmarking Study by the Newspaper Association of America found that page views dropped at least 10 per cent in more than half the news sites opting for a paywall. However, more than 20 per cent experienced increased page views. Moreover, 20 per cent of newspapers that had a paid-content strategy in place for a year or more reported increases in page views of 20 per cent or more.

So, setting up price walls may not in itself damage the transition in all cases, unless what is being offered is not worthy. But gains are slow. In 2011, The New York Times saw only 390 thousand of its 33 million unique US visitors opt for a digital subscription. And there are other challenges. With advertising through news delivery channels down, advertising revenues across media have fallen. Given the current revenue model of the industry, even allowing for savings in industrial costs as a result of a shift from print to digital, the price that needs to be charged to make the news business viable appears too high for market comfort.

Second, whatever the subscription price, any increase, often from nil, must be justified by an appealing, easily navigable and content-loaded website, which must, in terms of substance, coverage and/or appearance, attract readers. However, most newspapers did not choose to invest in the transition to online delivery when times were good. Being worthy requires money, and the best time to spend it is not when times are bad.

Third, there are institutions, including the Guardian, that are investing time, money and ingenuity to build a valuable web presence. In the process, they hope to attract the audience needed to kick-start advertising flow. The Guardian has emerged as the third most visited newspaper websites across the world, but has done so while staying with a free access model. Just a third of those readers are from Britain. A foreign readership is not confined to serious newspapers like the Guardian or The New York Times, which is the second largest newspaper website. It is also true of Britain’s Daily Mail with its tabloid style. The Mail, which is the largest newspaper website in terms of readership, has only a quarter of its readers from Britain.

Global reach is an advantage that English-language newspapers can exploit, since language allows them to woo a global audience to a far greater extent than other newspapers.

When newspapers like these choose to or continue to opt for the ‘free online’ model, the presumption must be that advertising revenues will respond to finance the costs that give the news website its distinguishing character. Who are these advertisers likely to be? There are firms that would like to cater to a global audience.

But most of them would like to target their advertising to local markets, given their specificities. So, the evidence is that monetising a global presence without a subscription model is difficult. Advertising volume is limited and advertising rates for the same product are lower in each jurisdiction compared to local media with a strong national reach. It is likely that this will change with growing global Commerce of a business-to-consumer kind. But if that takes time to grow relative to national eCommerce and retailing, as it is likely to, this model must give. However, till it does, the presence of such free-on-web news sites undermines those seeking to draw revenues from readers through subscription.

Finally, the competition that news websites face from free access sources is immensely larger and more threatening than the losses the music or book publishing sectors suffer on account of piracy. Copyright in the news business is difficult to define and administer. So news collators pull out material from their original websites and feed them for free to visitors to their websites, and use the traffic to try and earn revenues from means such as advertising or e-Commerce. With no investment in editorial costs and the ability to hone content to reach well-defined target groups, some of these may turn viable. There are also innumerable netizens and their collectives who are willing and eager to use the Net to report news and analyse developments for free. Competition from sources like these is difficult to face for an industry that has its costs defined but not its revenue sources.

All this only establishes the commonly accepted principle that the old revenue model for the news business is broken. As of now, the attempt to price online news is a feeble attempt to fix it in obvious ways. But an industry grasping at every straw can find some cause for optimism. One source of such optimism is that a high proportion of those who get their news from the Web do so from the online editions of established newspapers. The result is an increase in the aggregate readership (print and online) of many established newspapers. The problem for the big players in the news business is not loss of readership, but that of a paying readership.

Moreover, globally, reading newspapers through multiple media seems to be on the rise. In its September 2012 update of World Press Trends, the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA) noted: “More people read newspapers than ever before, thanks to the many ways they now can be read, but publishers have not yet found ways to match that growth with revenues from digital platforms … more than half the world’s adult population read a newspaper: more than 2.5 billion in print and more than 600 million in digital form. That represents more readers and users than total global users of the internet.”

Online advertising

In their view the task now, therefore, is to attract advertising adequate to cover editorial costs and the costs of going digital, besides delivering a profit. So the question to ask is whether advertising will soon move towards online news sites that invest heavily in editorial content. Unfortunately, the revenue from advertising aimed at the eyeballs of those going online for news does not accrue to the newspapers that are investing in checking the facts and recording the news with an adequate degree of accuracy and balance. Given the information overload on the Web, where an uncommitted reader goes is mediated by search engines like Google and Yahoo. These gateways are the first port of call. They, in turn, have adopted a clever practice of purveying news at no cost by providing a link to the story on a newspaper’s site, so as not to be seen as violating copyright. Therefore, though they are not the immediate providers of the news story, they serve as gateways to the multiple sources that provide a story on the event or issue involved.

Advertisers, clearly, would prefer to catch the audience here rather than after they have dispersed in various directions, depending on their preferences or partialities. Moreover, digital power and the character of search engines allow for an easy match between the target audience of an advertiser’s product and the tastes of those undertaking a particular search. This gives search engines an immense advantage in the advertising market, resulting in an overwhelming share of the advertising pie accruing to them as of now. A large share of Google’s annual revenue, of close to $40 billion, reportedly comes from the sale of ‘sponsored links’ that pop up alongside free search results. Since that advertising edifice is partly built on fact- checked and accurate news from the regular media, Google is being accused of closing an avenue through which newspapers and magazines can receive returns generated from services they deliver, and of capturing the revenues for itself. Google has partly accepted this by launching a scheme under which it sells advertisements for its newspaper ‘partners’ and keeps a share of the revenue.

The newspaper industry has reacted to this perceived loss of potential revenue by throwing the copyright book at the search industry. Pressured by the print media, governments in a number of leading European countries (Germany, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland and elsewhere) are debating or planning legislation aimed at getting search engines and news aggregators like Google (the main target, for obvious reasons) to pay a fee even when they display excerpts from news articles along with a link to the relevant newspaper or magazine’s web site. Google has responded aggressively, claiming in its brief to the French government, for example, that this would (i) destroy its revenue model and threaten its very existence; (ii) damage the newspaper industry, since 30–40 per cent of traffic on news sites in France is mediated by Google search; and (iii) go against Google’s commitment to a free and open Internet (which it of course dominates). However, it is working to quell the protest. It has settled its disputes with publishers in France and Belgium for what many say is a small price. While refusing to pay a license fee for the headlines and extracts it uses to contextualise its links to newspaper stories, it agreed to pay $80 million dollars into a fund that would be used to strengthen the presence of the French media on the Internet. In Belgium, Google has promised to advertise in the newspapers involved as well as to market advertisement space for them for a share of the revenue. Small change for retaining control over a big empire.

In sum, the traditional news business is having to share its meagre advertising revenue with a technology company called Google. The power of the latter because of its presence on the Web is immense—a fact partly reflected in the evidence that while revenues of the total newspaper industry in the US in 2012 was $38.6 billion, Google’s was as much as $50.2 billion. Not all Internet companies are missing a revenue model. As Robert McChesney notes, 13 of the 30 largest publicly traded corporations in the US are Internet-related companies.

Some probable outcomes

The challenge is doubly daunting for those who have decided that providing an online edition for free is not a viable proposition. Charging for content requires ensuring that it is unique. If, for example, news aggregators on the web can, without being prosecuted for copyright violation, access and publish not just links to but actual content from the originating website, there is no guarantee that many would stay with the online edition of a newspaper. They would instead turn to aggregators providing versions for free. Newspapers would lose not just their subscriptions but their advertising as well. Thus, imposing copyright law is crucial for any strategy that seeks to monetise the web.

It is not enough that content is unique. It also needs to be of high quality. So, pursuing such a strategy requires substantial investment in editorial costs and in exploiting the benefits of the new media for purveying news and analysis. Unfortunately, the behaviour of most print media businesses has been counter-cyclical: ignoring the Internet when times are good and rushing to it when times are bad. With revenues down and margins thin, this is not the best time. This has triggered cost reduction efforts, including in editorial costs. As a result of staff reduction, the number of full-time professional employees in the newspaper industry has fallen to less than 40,000, which is the lowest reached since the middle of the 1970s. According to a report on the State of the News Media 2013 of the Project for Excellence in Journalism at the Pew Research Centre,19 the news industry is “undermanned and underprepared to uncover stories, dig deep into emerging ones or to question information put into its hands.”

As the Pew report puts it, the public is taking notice. “Nearly a third of US adults, 31 per cent, have stopped turning to a news outlet because it no longer provided them with the news they were accustomed to getting. … With reporting resources cut to the bone and fewer specialised beats, journalists’ level of expertise in any one area and the ability to go deep into a story are compromised. Indeed, when people who had heard something about the financial struggles were asked which effect they noticed more, stories that were less complete or fewer stories over all, 48 per cent named less complete stories while 31 per cent mostly noticed fewer stories.”

All said, as of now, even if newspapers find a place on the web behind paywalls, they are likely to survive only by shrinking the scale of their operations. If that remains so, the future of the industry is indeed bleak. With little spent on covering the news, checking the facts and analysing them, newspaper web sites can hardly claim or ensure any significant superiority over the many communities that pool reportage on issues of common interest. So one needs to be optimistic to believe that at least some of the print news sources will successfully go digital, implementing a revenue model that combines priced access and advertising. This is an outcome that does not look likely today, except for specialist newspapers and magazines like the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal and The Economist.

The not-for-profit alternative

A second possible outcome involves shrinking the news business and making it dependent on small and large philanthropy. Some believe that it is possible to think of news as a not-for-profit activity supported by charitable foundations which see news reporting as an element of ‘a good society’. But whether this will happen depends on how much money the activity would need to sustain itself, without compromising quality. A 2009 estimate by David Swensen and Michael Schmidt 20 suggested that the annual cost of The New York Times’ newsroom worked out to $200 million-plus at the time. This would have been covered by a $5 billion endowment that would also guarantee the paper’s editorial independence. Based on that calculation, the Nieman Journalism Lab has estimated that it might cost $114 billion to sustain every US newspaper and employing the 56,900 journalists the US print media did in its heyday, circa 1990.21 That, many may argue, is small money when compared with the trillions the US tax payer shelled out to protect the financial sector from collapsing as a result of its speculation driven by avarice. So, a combination of philanthropy, government subsidies and tax breaks which convert the print business into a not-for-profit activity may be the way to go.

In fact some analysts see this as the best possible outcome. Robert McChesney22 has this to say in response to the question, “How are people going to pay for content online?”

“There’s nothing going on with the Internet right now that answers tat question. Not a thing. To me, it’s the really great outstanding issue. In my view … journalism is a public good. It’s something that society desperately needs that the market can’t produce in sufficient quality or quantity. …

I think we’re going to have to come up with a way to subsidise journalism online. To have independent, non-censored, competing, nonprofit, non-commercial newsrooms across the country. We need ways people can support themselves to do journalism.

I think it’s depressing to glorify citizen journalists. Citizen journalists are just unpaid journalists. And unpaid journalism means you’re only going to cover the stuff you enjoy covering because, hey, no one’s paying you. Some stories aren’t fun to cover, but we need to have them covered. Someone’s got to go sit at that city council meeting. Someone we can trust, and ideally more than one person, so we have competition. We have a public interest in that. That's a public good.

That’s the great issue before us. How we’re going to get funding to have independent nonprofit, non-commercial public media.”

Others would demur that this, if feasible, will result in a subordinate and biased print media.

A third trend likely to characterise smaller, local newspapers is to look for and find synergies in combining news online with other businesses (such as eCommerce and gaming) to deliver a quantum jump in price-based and advertis-driven revenue.

Social media

Finally, there is the option of the news business turning free and anarchic. There is much talk today of how proliferation of the social media is creating a Fifth Estate that will displace the Fourth Estate.23 The Fifth Estate is indeed delivering-through tweets, Facebook posts, blogs and the like—a large volume of information and opinion on newsworthy events and other subjects. It has also been seen, as in the case of the ‘Arab Spring’ and in a number of societies with a controlled media, as a force to record injustice, to organise dissent and protest, and to contribute to a democratic transition.

This role on occasion cannot be denied. But structurally, the social media are not endowed with the democratic potential attributed to it. Being a space in which the distinction between consumers and providers of news is blurred, and where there is no coordinating agency checking facts, privileging facts over opinion and filtering out prejudice, the social media can go awry when taking on a journalistic role. Way back in 2008, Google’s chief executive Eric Schmidt had famously declared that the Internet was fast becoming a ‘cesspool’ in which false information thrives, making quality content from reputed media companies crucial.24 The ‘coverage’ of the bomb explosions at the finish-line of the Boston marathon is the most recent instance when this became clear. Moreover, there is no single, common community on the Net. The audience for any information shared or set of views expressed on the social media is self-selecting. This could create what have been described as virtual echo chambers, in which shared prejudices influence not only the information purveyed but also the conclusions arrived at. The Fourth Estate, as we knew it till now, is by no means an unsullied pillar of democracy. But the social media with no checks-and- balances cannot be a good substitute.

What then can we expect? The shift to online news access will no doubt continue. This will perhaps accompany a split between news sources (not just newspapers) that are global and those that are local. There is also likely to be a split between those online news ventures that depend on a combination of paywalls and advertising, and those in which news provision is a free add-on to a host of other services. Expect the former to be the true news sites as compared to the more gossipy or rumour-based social media equivalent. Finally, there could also be a closer alliance between technology ventures or Internet companies and news sources in the provision of news, with a pricing and advertising revenue-sharing agreement that could make the news business viable.

If successful, this would involve a redistribution of revenues between the news and Internet businesses. In the process, the pattern of ownership and control is bound to change. Expect, therefore, a major restructuring of the news business. How that will influence content, in terms of combination of fact and opinion, credible information and sensationalism, and progressive versus regressive viewpoints, is a matter for speculation.

How relevant is all this to India? At the moment it does not seem to matter, with print newspaper circulation and advertising still high and even rising. But the model here too is the one that capitalism has given to the Fourth Estate. Still low but rising incomes, enhanced literacy and education, a messy democracy and the as yet limited spread of the Internet have ensured that the Indian print media are still short of the peak on an inverted U-shaped circulation curve. That does seem to breed complacency. As N. Ram argues, “In critically assessing performance a clear distinction needs to be drawn and maintained between the state or fortunes of the news media and the state of journalism.”25 The evidence seems to be that, with some honourable exceptions, the Indian print media is slipping relative to the past. We have even entered a phase when instances of advertorials and paid news are routine. This could mean that in the face of the technological challenge from the Internet, the print news business per se will not hold. The crisis is imminent but yet to arrive. So the questions here are different. Will the industry discipline itself and invest adequately in an online presence before the downturn comes? And will it find a business model that will work? Frankly, your answers are as good as mine.","Fri, 03 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,"['advertising', 'print', 'revenues', 'internet', 'cent', 'newspaper', 'online', 'age', 'media', 'business', 'newspapers']",

That’s certainly true. However, taggants at the scene might have brought about a quicker and cleaner investigation, and perhaps avoided the death of one law enforcement officer and a city held hostage.

After the videotape was broadcast internationally, the Tsarnaev brothers appear to have armed themselves and prepared, erratically, to escape Boston or to precipitate a last stand or to bomb again. That might not have been the case with a quieter taggant investigation.

Sean S, among the commenters, also says that because the Boston bombs contained fireworks propellant, they wouldn’t have been covered by the taggants legislation that the National Rifle Assn. helped to squelch. But that is not the case. The gunpowder used in fireworks -- a secondary use of the product -- would still have had to contain taggants placed there by the gunpowder manufacturer.

And as the Op-Ed pointed out, that could have quickly yielded an important clue that would have led the FBI within hours to the Phantom Fireworks stand in Seabrook, N.H., where, as the proprietor told reporters, he remembered the odd Tsarnaev purchase. As it was, Phantom ran the name through its database three days after the bombings, after the suspects had been identified publicly, and then called the FBI.

Our Op-Ed did not hold out taggants as a magic solution. Think of them as little specks of artificial DNA at the scene that point not to an individual but to a possible place where the bomb materials were purchased. If you were a police detective, you’d really like to have that information. And if you’re the victim of a bombing, or a family member, you’re definitely going to want the police to have that information.

As rural migrants flood into the city, young men too poor to afford the pageantry of a traditional wedding opt instead to kidnap a bride. (Photo: Dean C.K. Cox)

Seven years ago Aijan was walking home from her waitressing job in central Bishkek with two girlfriends. They did not notice the three men following them. As two men tackled the other women, one dragged Aijan, 21 at the time, into a waiting car.

“I was screaming, cursing, and hitting them. […] I was crying for them to let me go, but they wouldn’t listen,” Aijan recalls. She did not know where they were headed. When the car finally stopped, a stranger opened the door. “You should be happy that I’m kidnapping you,” was the first thing Aziz, Aijan’s future husband, said.

Many know of bride kidnapping as a phenomenon in rural Kyrgyzstan. But few realize it happens in the relatively liberal capital, Bishkek, too. According to human rights ombudsman Tursunbek Akun, as rural migrants flood into the city, young men too poor to afford the pageantry of a traditional wedding opt instead to kidnap a bride – a method that anecdotal evidence suggests has increased throughout the country in the penurious post-Soviet period.

“Moving to Bishkek, they don’t become liberal-minded all at once,” Akun said of the young men.

Neither do their families. Bowing to social pressure, parents of a kidnapping victim often do not take their daughter back because, the thinking goes, a kidnapping suggests the woman has somehow been sullied. Many kidnapping victims are raped and a daughter’s virginity is prized in conservative Kyrgyz households.

“I wanted to run away, but his family followed me everywhere,” said Aijan (not her real name). She added that her own parents visited her the day after her abduction to say they would not take her home.

A new law signed by President Almazbek Atambayev in January aims to discourage bride kidnapping by increasing the criminal penalty from a 3-to-7-year prison term to 5-10 years. Such a sentence would make the punishment for bride kidnapping roughly the same as that for sheep theft. The legislation also changes the way a criminal case is registered, from a private complaint to a public one. That means a case cannot be dropped, as it could before, if both parties reconcile.

Most cases never make it to court in the first place, observers say. “We ask girls, ‘How can we help you?’ If you want to charge him, we will give you legal advice, provide you with shelter and a lawyer. But they don’t want it,” says Munara Beknazarova, head of Open Line, a Bishkek-based NGO that lobbies to end bride kidnapping.

Beknazarova says conservative mores – especially among parents afraid of being publicly shamed – constitute a major obstacle. “If I could go back to the past, I would leave… But my family told me they blessed our marriage. I was angry and lost,” said Aijan, who today lives in Bishkek and has two children with Aziz, who works in Russia.

While there is little research available, a survey conducted by Open Line found that out of 268 kidnappings that resulted in marriage, 60 percent eventually ended in divorce. At the same time, there is little incentive for women to leave their kidnappers: almost half of the divorcees – 46 percent – admitted that after returning to their parents’ house, they had no say in family issues anymore, and their status in the family diminished.

Beknazarova is optimistic about the new law. “Men should understand that girls have a right to choose. And if this [law] is a lever for action, then I support it.” Her position is widely shared among civil society activists. Ombudsman Akun calls the law an “important precondition” to stop bride kidnapping. “This is not a tradition, this is a crime that is alien to our society,” he told EurasiaNet.org.

Getting the public to see bride kidnapping as a crime is an ongoing challenge. Bubusara Ryskulova, head of the Sezim crisis center in Bishkek, thinks that the law will not be effective until society at large demands change. “Girls should learn to protect their rights. Men need to be told that women are not property, they are human beings,” she argues.

Uluk, a 23-year-old part-time driver in Bishkek, highlights the challenge for anti-bride-kidnapping advocates. “Just think about it, our parents and grandparents were raised like this. Many families that I know were created by kidnapping the bride and they live normally,” Uluk says.

Though many would argue that bride kidnapping is not a tradition, but a product of recent economic decline, that is no consolation to Aijan. “If I wasn’t kidnapped, I would have studied, I would have gotten a degree,” she said. “I can say that it negatively influenced my life.”","Fri, 10 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://eurasianet.org/sites/default/files/styles/article/public/images/051013_0.jpg?itok=wZAOTprV,"['young', 'bride', 'bishkek', 'kidnapping', 'men', 'say', 'law', 'phenomenon', 'rural', 'parents', 'kyrgyzstan', 'family', 'aijan']",

Huge numbers of people on Earth are keen to leave the planet forever and seek a new life homesteading on Mars.

About 78,000 people have applied to become Red Planet colonists with the nonprofit organization Mars One since its application process opened on April 22, officials announced today (May 7). Mars One aims to land four people on the Red Planet in 2023 as the vanguard of a permanent colony, with more astronauts arriving every two years thereafter.

""With 78,000 applications in two weeks, this is turning out to be the most desired job in history,"" Mars One CEO and co-founder Bas Lansdorp said in a statement. ""These numbers put us right on track for our goal of half a million applicants."" [Mars One's Red Planet Colony Project (Gallery)]

Mars One estimates that landing four settlers on Mars in 2023 will cost about $6 billion. The Netherlands-based organization plans to pay most of the bills by staging a global reality-TV event, with cameras documenting all phases of the mission from astronaut selection to the colonists' first years on the Red Planet.

The application process extends until Aug. 31. Anyone at least 18 years of age can apply, by submitting to the Mars One website a 1-minute video explaining his or her motivation to become a Red Planet settler. (You can also watch other applicants' videos at the site.)

Mars One charges an application fee, which ranges from $5 to $75 depending on the wealth of the applicant's home country. United States citizens pay $38, Lansdorp said.

When the application process closes, reviewers will pick 50 to 100 candidates from each of the 300 regions around the world that Mars One has identified. By 2015, this pool will be whittled down to a total of 28 to 40 candidates, officials said.

This core group will be split into groups of four, which will train for their one-way Mars mission for about seven years. Finally, an audience vote will pick one of these groups to be humanity's first visitors to the Red Planet.

So far, Mars One has received applications from more than 120 countries, officials said. The United States leads the way with 17,324, followed by China (10,241) and the United Kingdom (3,581). Russia, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Argentina and India round out the top 10.

""Mars One is a mission representing all humanity, and its true spirit will be justified only if people from the entire world are represented,"" Lansdorp said. ""I'm proud that this is exactly what we see happening.""

The announcement of Mars One's application flood comes in the middle of a big week for manned Mars exploration. Scientists, engineers, NASA officials and a range of other Red Planet exploration advocates are currently meeting in Washington, D.C. for the Humans 2 Mars summit, which runs through Wednesday (May 8).

And today, famed Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin released his new book, ""Mission to Mars: My Vision for Space Exploration"" (National Geographic Books), which was written with veteran space reporter (and SPACE.com columnist) Leonard David.

67,67,FL-2013-000054-CHN,EU embraces green infrastructure package – EURACTIV.com - EurActiv,https://www.euractiv.com/section/sustainable-dev/news/eu-embraces-green-infrastructure-package/,"The European Union adopted a new strategy yesterday (6 May) aimed at promoting green infrastructure, and putting natural processes at the heart of its spatial planning.

EU money will now encourage green solutions to infrastructure problems, such as allowing natural wetlands to absorb excess water from heavy rain, instead of building concrete flood protection infrastructure.

In what green campaigners in Brussels view as a ‘Eureka moment’, the package will allow stone beaches to receive preferential funding for coastal protection, and river banks and marsh areas to be chosen for soaking up floodwaters and reducing water pollution.

""Building green infrastructure is often a good investment for nature, for the economy and for jobs,” Environment Commissioner Janez Poto?nik said. “We should provide society with solutions that work with nature instead of against it, where that makes economic and environmental sense.”

Green infrastructure is often cheaper and more durable than traditional civil engineering solutions, according to the EU’s statement, which also noted that heat waves can be mitigated by biodiversity-rich parks, green spaces and fresh air corridors.

Europe’s biodiversity has been hammered over the last 50 years by habitat loss, land degradation and fragmentation, due to the rapid expansion of cities and transport infrastructure.

Theoretically, the new package will open the door to reversing this through the use of natural solutions that create jobs, and offer multiple health and environmental benefits.

Proposals

Specifically, the new EU package proposes:

Upgrading access to finance for green infrastructure projects with an EU financing facility by 2014, and support from the European Investment Bank.

Supporting EU-level projects and carrying out an assessment of the options for an EU-wide green infrastructure network by the end of 2015.

Developing guidance before 2014 to show how green infrastructure can be integrated into policy over the next budgetary period.

Promoting green infrastructure in areas such as agriculture, forestry, nature, water, marine and fisheries, regional and cohesion policy, climate change mitigation and adaptation, transport, energy, disaster prevention and land use policies.

Improving research and data, and promoting innovative technologies.

Green groups rushed to welcome the new proposal, which WWF hailed as “long overdue.”

Green reaction

“We cannot afford to keep pumping money into traditional engineering infrastructures when in many cases nature provides a more cost effective and lasting solution,” said Alberto Arroyo Schnell, a senior policy advisor at WWF.

The EU plans would also ease pressures on the environment caused by intensive farming and infrastructure such as dams and, levies and canals, according to the European Environmental Bureau (EEB).

Martina Mlinari?, a spokeswoman for the EEB, said that investing in green infrastructure would ""deliver significant benefits in both economic and ecological terms.”

“The move from grey to green is vital to reaching the objectives which the EU set for 2020,” she said, “and not only in the field of environment.”

The package will now need to ensure that funding is routed from the EU’s cohesion and agricultural policies, currently being negotiated between EU states and the European Parliament.

A flood of views to a company's Wikipedia page may be a sign that their stock price is about to plummet.

That's the implication of a study published on 8 May in Scientific Reports, which looked at Wikipedia page view data from 2007 to 2012 and correlated it with changes in the stock market price for companies listed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

An uptick in the number of Wikipedia page views, as compared with the average weekly views, was followed by a fall in a company's share price.

The research suggests that Wikipedia pages, which can be edited by anyone, are part of the information-gathering process for financial transactions -- potentially useful knowledge for people wanting to play the system. ""We were really intrigued by the idea that data from usage of Internet information resources such as Wikipedia might help us understand how traders gather information before making these decisions,"" lead author Suzy Moat, Senior Research Fellow at Warwick Business School, told Wired.co.uk. ""The connection we find between views of Wikipedia pages and stock market moves suggests this may indeed be the case. This suggests that data on people's usage of online information services, such as Wikipedia or Google may be used to anticipate decisions they might later take in the real world.""

Previous research has shown that the volume of financially-related searches on Google and also the

""mood"" of tweets on Twitter can be linked to changes in the stock market. Big data approaches to real world trends have also shown links between web searches and flu infections.

The correlation with a fall in share price, rather than a rise, could be because of humans' risk-averse nature. A trader might consider a sale at a lower price than previously expected of greater consequence, and therefore spend more time researching that trade.","Wed, 08 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT","https://media.wired.co.uk/photos/606dad3385fac47146ccc33e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/stockmarket.jpg","['wikipedia', 'page', 'research', 'information', 'changes', 'views', 'data', 'price', 'stock', 'suggests', 'market', 'predict']",

The James Smith First Nation, the Cowessess First Nation and the RM of Fish Creek bring the total number of communities that have declared emergencies to 13.

“We’re still seeing in the rural areas significant impact to infrastructure such as roads either overtopping or having to be cut, so most of the rural municipalities are still facing some challenges,” Duane McKay, Saskatchewan’s commissioner of emergency management, said Saturday.

Highway 3, just west of Spiritwood, was closed Saturday because of flooding.

Meanwhile, the Water Security Agency said sandbagging and other efforts to keep the water out of the town of Radisson, northwest of Saskatoon, were holding.

The agency said the good news is that water levels appear to be going down a little around Radisson.

“With the snow cover there being decreased and it seems it’s calming a little bit and we’re hoping that we’ve seen the worst of that situation,” said agency spokesman Patrick Boyle.

“The town has done a lot of mitigation work to facilitate the flow of water away from the community in Radisson.”

Almost all of the 73 people who had to leave their houses on the Poundmaker First Nation have been allowed to go home. However, a boil water order remained in place Saturday for the reserve, northwest of North Battleford.

About 200 people on the Onion Lake Cree Nation, north of Lloydminster, remain on alert to leave if water there rises.

Further south, the Water Security Agency is keeping an eye on the Qu’Appelle River watershed, including Wascana Creek, which runs through Regina.

“This is sort of the developing situation and we’re kind of waiting for the water to show up, as is everyone else,” said Boyle.

“There’s still pretty significant snow cover in that area and we’re expecting more flows to increase here over the weekend, with the peak coming next week some time. So, we’re still waiting for that to happen”

Wascana Lake, in the centre of the city, is expected to reach 571.8 metres. That’s higher than the flood level in 2011, but lower than the record flood of 572.2 metres reached in 1974.

The city of Regina has put thousands of sandbags and other water barriers along sections of the creek to protect homes.

Flooding has already led to the evacuation of a youth detention centre in Regina because of concerns about a bridge over Wascana Creek leading to the facility. Another bridge on the western edge of Regina was closed Friday due to rising water levels on the creek.

Regina city officials have sent letters to 340 homes advising residents to be ready for an evacuation by packing a kit with medication and cash and by moving valuables to higher floors.

But the city also said the potential for Wascana Creek to flood homes is extremely small.

There was more snow than normal in many areas of Saskatchewan this winter and colder-than-normal temperatures this spring delayed the melt.

The Water Security Agency has warned that the entire southern half of the province will see run-off levels above or well-above normal. It said run-off is expected to be very high and flooding is likely to occur from Moose Jaw to Indian Head, including Regina, and south past Weyburn to near the United States border. Saskatoon, Prince Albert and North Battleford are also in the red zone.","Sat, 04 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/emergencyfloodgn.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1,"['rise', 'emergency', 'officials', 'snow', 'waiting', 'nation', 'wascana', 'security', 'flood', 'water', 'creek', 'city', 'regina', 'agency', 'levels']",

I wanted a break from modern life — the hamster wheel of an email inbox, the constant flood of WWW information which drowned out my sanity. I wanted to escape.

I thought the internet might be an unnatural state for us humans, or at least for me. Maybe I was too ADD to handle it, or too impulsive to restrain my usage. I'd used the internet constantly since I was twelve, and as my livelihood since I was fourteen. I'd gone from paperboy, to web designer, to technology writer in under a decade. I didn't know myself apart from a sense of ubiquitous connection and endless information. I wondered what else there was to life. ""Real life,"" perhaps, was waiting for me on the other side of the web browser.

My plan was to quit my job, move home with my parents, read books, write books, and wallow in my spare time. In one glorious gesture I'd outdo all quarter-life crises to come before me. I'd find the real Paul, far away from all the noise, and become a better me.

My goal would be to discover what the internet had done to me over the years

But for some reason, The Verge wanted to pay me to leave the internet. I could stay in New York and share my findings with the world, beam missives about my internet-free life to the citizens of the internet I'd left behind, sprinkle wisdom on them from my high tower.

My goal, as a technology writer, would be to discover what the internet had done to me over the years. To understand the internet by studying it ""at a distance."" I wouldn't just become a better human, I would help us all to become better humans. Once we understood the ways in which the internet was corrupting us, we could finally fight back.

At 11:59PM on April 30th, 2012, I unplugged my Ethernet cable, shut off my Wi-Fi, and swapped my smartphone for a dumb one. It felt really good. I felt free.

A couple weeks later, I found myself among 60,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews, pouring into New York's Citi Field to learn from the world's most respected rabbis about the dangers of the internet. Naturally. Outside the stadium, I was spotted by a man brandishing one of my own articles about leaving the internet. He was ecstatic to meet me. I had chosen to avoid the internet for many of the same reasons his religion expressed caution about the modern world.

""It's reprogramming our relationships, our emotions, and our sensitivity,"" said one of the rabbis at the rally. It destroys our patience. It turns kids into ""click vegetables.""

My new friend outside the stadium encouraged me to make the most of my year, to ""stop and smell the flowers.""

Southern Cross the Dog

(Ecco, 2013)

Let’s get this on the table first thing: I know Bill Cheng. For years, actually. We attended grad school together, and so we often stayed up late in bars talking about things both grand and silly. I have witnessed Bill transfigure via karaoke into a young Tom Waits, pint of Guinness in his hand. I saw the guy get married, cheered from my table, and whooped. That said, to know someone is to never really know someone. Such is the trap of consciousness. And yet the gift of fiction, its privilege, is to allow the reader to inhabit the soul of another—that of a character, sure, but also that of a writer. It’s for this reason, after reading Bill’s extraordinary first novel, that I feel like I’m only just now getting to know him. Southern Cross the Dog has garnered lots of attention for its uncanny voice—and there are several voices in the novel—but most notably for Robert Chatham’s, a young black man in constant sorrow. Robert suffers the unforgiving lashes of racism, poverty, and what seems a cosmos bent on taking him down. But really it’s Cheng’s voice that impresses most, not least because he so generously steps aside and lets the others speak.

Bill and I met at an uptown café for lunch, like we often do, to talk about the novel, and, for the first time in years, I was at a loss for words. This was a new Bill Cheng, for me, anyway, because he had just written a big and beautiful book. A book about the South, about the blues, about the Devil himself. Or I should say, the Dog.



Scott Cheshire (Rail): Okay, first, tell me how you came to write this book, and I’m referring specifically to a Chinese-American, born and raised in Bayside, Queens, writing the experience of a young black male in the early 20th century South?



Bill Cheng: Blues, especially country blues, is something that’s been important to me for a long time. I listened to it almost obsessively when I was in my late teens and early 20s. So when it came time to write the book, I wanted to pay tribute to that. It has a kind of language, and landscape, and mythology all its own.



When we were in grad school together, we had this ideology drilled into us that we shouldn’t write “what we know” but what we wanted to know. It’s liberating to believe as writers that, the stories we tell aren’t limited to where and when we live, or how we’ve grown up but by the things that drive us. For me, it was blues and the kind of world it paints; that feeling of being set upon by the universe and suddenly realizing how fragile the structures in our lives are.



I already know what it’s like to be Chinese and from Bayside. I personally don’t find that experience is particularly interesting or worth sharing, right now. It hasn’t really set a fire in me the way blues music has.



Rail: Tell me more about that. Did the form of blues affect your take on the form of the novel?



Cheng: Not really. Blues has very specific structures of repetition and call and response. The book isn’t really constructed in the same way, although there are sections that do resonate with each other. The music had more of a hand in the plot and tone and setting than the actual form of the book. There were specific songs that drove the idea for certain chapters, certain lines, certain characters. For instance, the flood at the start of the book drew inspiration from John Lee Hooker’s “Tupelo,” and the first line of the epilogue is taken from a Lightnin’ Hopkins song.



Rail: There’s a lovely and sincere acknowledgement at the end of the book, naming several blues musicians. It put a knot in my throat.



Cheng: I was a teenager when I came to the blues. They were difficult years, especially if you’re a sensitive kid like I was—always feeling things a little too keenly. I spent a lot of time not being very sure of myself, worrying about the adult I’d become. I’m also what I guess are now called one of the Millennials. The W.T.C. attacks came when I was a freshman in college and suddenly the whole country became less sure of itself. Everything seemed so impossibly fragile. Blues helped make my world seem more solid. It puts our sadness into a context. It lets us commune through our grief. It both soothes us and savages us. So I wrote this book in thanks to those musicians. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to communicate completely what blues music is and all that it has done for me but I hope Southern Cross the Dog is a step in that direction.



Rail: Speaking of “savaging us,” the characters are often described in terms of “meat,” solely physical.



Cheng: So much of the blues is about pain. Emotional but also physical—the strain of hard labor, of physical exhaustion. The main character Robert goes through a lot of pain. But that pain runs parallel to his mental and spiritual anguish. In some ways, it’s very much a book about suffering and it was important to render a strong and vivid physical experience as a means of understanding that suffering.



We’ve all experienced injustice or humiliation but we don’t necessarily each experience it the same way. Pain is more ubiquitous. It speaks to something ancient and animal in us.



Rail: The book is also about evil, even the Devil. At one point Eli Cutter, says “There is a devil in everything.” Are they the same thing for you, or for Robert, or the world of the book?



Cheng: I believe more in the weakness of men than I do in evil. Robert lives in a fatalistic world where the rules of the universe run counter to his happiness. He’s a young black man living in the Jim Crow-era American South, a society where racism and poverty is systematized. I see that more as a product of greed, ignorance, laziness, fear, and apathy than I do of evil. It’s also what causes Robert and his family to vest in this belief system where the bad things that happen are viewed as punishment from on high.



Now I believe all of us have felt that way at some time or another—that we’ve been selected out by the universe for punishment. But I don’t think that’s actually how the world works.



Rail: Can you tell me about the Dog? The image strikes me as devilish, even hellish. How real is the dog for Robert, do you think?



Cheng: Dogs are a powerful image in blues culture, especially in Robert Johnson’s Hellhound on my Trail. In the book, the main character’s perception of his bad fortune is manifested in a large black dog that follows after him. How real is it for Robert? Real enough that the image frightens him and drives him to desperate measures. Now, is it an actual dog from hell or the product of an unwell mind? That I can’t decide for you.



Rail: The book is also punctuated by “offerings.” I mean like Dora’s pebble for Robert in the opening pages, Eli’s “man part,” and the devil pouch he offers Robert. At one especially lovely moment a small boy offers Robert a piece of candy. Most of the offerings are for Robert.



Cheng: In certain regions of the Delta and in New Orleans, there is a religious folk tradition called hoodoo which was formative to some of the greatest blues songs of the last century. Many of these songs feature totems like mojo hands, John the Conqueroo’, nation sacks, and black cat bones. They’re used to lay tricks, manipulating the spirit world to protect the user or cause harm to befall his or her enemies. In the same way, the physical tokens in the book are used to communicate a spiritual connection between characters.



When Eli passes the devil pouch to Robert, it’s almost as if Eli is extending protection over Robert, but with that protection comes a kind of Faustian debt.



I’m not a superstitious person by any means but I have my own totems. I don’t believe they’re magic, but when I hold them I think about their significance; I think about the people who’ve given them to me, what they’ve meant in my life. That in itself provides a kind of strength, a kind of magic.



Rail: Writers are fond of totems, no? I have my own.



Cheng: I think it comes from that part of ourselves that doesn’t fully trust or understand what we’re doing when we write fiction. There’s something audacious about writing fiction—how we make things up and then present them as real. We sit down to a blank page and construct an entirely new universe. We populate it with people that have never existed, setting them loose on each other. And to us, they are real. We watch them live and love and fight and die. They break our hearts, these little made-up things in our heads. It’s a little spooky.



So we have totems, and rituals—little things that make sense of that process, like we’re just a conduit for a more mysterious power.



Rail: Aside from the blues, I’m guessing certain fiction writers or books have had a large impact on your style, which is considerable.



Cheng: The people we studied with at grad school, for one. I’ve said this before, but we were both incredibly lucky. Without mentioning any names, I don’t think you can get a stronger tutelage in imagination, daring, humility, and technical prowess than we did.



Honestly, there are too many books to name. I can’t even remember all the novels I’ve read between when I started my draft and when I finally submitted my last round of edits. Each and every one of them has had some impact because every book, even the ones that I find only middling, teach me something about stories or language.



One that particularly sticks out in my memory is Shadow Country by Peter Matthiessen. It’s a hell of a book. Just under a thousand pages and you come out the other end of it an older person.



Rail: There is a significant shift in tone and style about two thirds of the way through the book with “The Shining New South” section.



Cheng: When I think about constructing a book, I think about it from an engineering standpoint. What structures does the story need? Where is it too slow? Where is it overly constrictive? And always, what is driving the story forward?



Sometimes that involves fracturing the narrative. Sometimes that involves giving space to a new character or changing the geography or modulating the tone. I knew before I launched into that section there’s a kind of momentum I wanted going in. We don’t see Robert right away and it builds a kind of tension that’s finally released when he re-emerges as an adult.



Rail: And there seems a kind of balance between the two white women of the book. Robert’s brother is lynched for spending time with a white woman, and this sets much of the book in motion, and then, later in the novel, Robert becomes involved with Frankie, a French white woman trapper.



Cheng: Yes. If Robert’s brother epitomizes the fate Robert wishes most to avoid—that, he, in fact spends his entire life avoiding—it is necessary that he be forced to confront it. Good advice, I think, for writing and writers both.



Rail: I think that’s true. But Robert does run, is always running from trouble. The book is largely aftermath.



Cheng: The Whitney Museum has an exhibit now called Blues for Smoke. I haven’t been able to go, but my editor went. She e-mailed me this quote on David Hammons’s piece, Chasing the Blue Train: “Hammons installation suggests the constant mobility and multiplicity of the blues––and that it must always be ‘chased’ along the tracks.” That sounds about right. We keep moving because we keep wanting.



Rail: And what does Robert want?



Cheng: To go home.","Sun, 05 May 2013 11:12:04 GMT",https://brooklynrail.org/article_image/image/11178/cheshire-web1.jpg,"['bill', 'know', 'kind', 'book', 'world', 'things', 'scott', 'dont', 'cheshire', 'robert', 'way', 'rail', 'brooklyn', 'think', 'blues', 'cheng']",

That was the year millions of people marched to stop a bill that would have made undocumented immigrants (and anyone who helped them) felons.

Many took the day off work to march—making that May Day the largest political strike in U.S. history.

Those immigrant marchers from Latin America undoubtedly knew more about the origins of May Day as International Workers’ Day than U.S. workers do.

On Saturday, May 1, 1886—a work day—35,000 Chicago workers walked off their jobs, demanding the eight-hour day for 10 hours’ pay. Strikes for the eight-hour day continued throughout the city, police rioted, and four workers who had led demonstrations (three of them German-born immigrants) were hanged.

A hundred years later, on May Day 1986, I was living in Guatemala City. Some workers at a small factory were on strike, resisting the 12-hour day their boss wanted to impose. A leader named Julio Coj spoke at a rally: “The martyrs of Chicago died for the eight-hour day, and we owe it to their memory to fight for it as well.”

I was moved to tears by Coj’s words—and embarrassed that so few U.S. workers had ever heard of “the martyrs of Chicago.”

Assault from Both Ends

Twenty-seven years further on, the eight-hour day is in worse shape than Julio Coj could have imagined—and it’s under assault from both ends. Some of us work stupefying amounts of overtime, willingly or no, and others can’t get enough hours to make ends meet. Everywhere, the trend is for management to demand “flexibility” to schedule the number of hours it decides on for a given day or week, with diminishing notice to the worker.

At least we get paid for all those extra hours, for now—but House Republicans have just introduced a bill with the Orwellian title “Working Families Flexibility Act.” The bill would let employers replace time-and-a-half overtime pay with time-and-a-half comp time. No worries, though: the bill forbids the boss to “intimidate, threaten or coerce” a worker to accept this arrangement. All you gotta do is say no. If you’re not worried about keeping your at-will job.

At UPS, which has the largest union contract in the private sector, some Teamster drivers have been agitating for a mandatory work-day of no more than 9.5 hours; 12 hours is not unusual for them, and those who try to keep it to 9.5 will find the boss riding with them in their truck. Their new tentative agreement may or may not address forced overtime.

In the auto industry, workers have fought unsuccessfully to “Stop the FOP”—a Flexible Operating Pattern that has them working 10 hours a day, four days a week, all at straight time. In this “Alternative Work Schedule,” two-thirds of the workforce is in the plant every Saturday. A third works two different shifts (day and evening) in the same week.

The Postal Workers’ 2011 contract took away the guarantee of a 40-hour job, giving management flexibility to establish work weeks anywhere from 30 to 48 hours. A worker’s regular schedule can be from six to 12 hours a day, with no overtime paid, and up to 10 percent of the clerk craft can work without a fixed weekly schedule, as “full-time flexible.” In practice, says Seattle APWU Vice President David Yao, the new options have been “a mixed bag, for both sides.” In some areas the union has used it to establish schedules that some workers actually prefer, such as four 10s.

Meanwhile a hiring freeze has many letter carriers working 10-hour days, six days a week, delivering letters after sundown to cover vacant mail routes. The contract prohibits delivery in the dark, reports recent retiree Jamie Partridge, but “they just settle all the grievances and pay people $50 each time,” since paying overtime and penalties is still cheaper than hiring more full-time workers.

In retail and fast food, meanwhile, management has workers on just-in-time non-schedules where they seldom get as many as eight hours a day. Companies like Jamba Juice, Pier One, and Aeropostale use software that predicts customer traffic based on the weather and other factors, and makes last-minute schedule changes in increments as small as 15 minutes.

A survey of 436 New York retail workers last year found that 70 percent didn’t know their schedules more than a week ahead of time and only 17 percent had a set schedule.

Walmart workers around the country are complaining that short hours are creating long lines and empty shelves while workers rush around trying to do more in less time. Walmart store managers get bonuses for keeping down payroll. OUR Walmart and the Retail Action Project—a project of the United Food and Commercial Workers—are fighting for more normal hours.

Warehouse workers at Fresh Direct, an online grocer in New York, say their shifts can last 16 hours—and that might be in a facility refrigerated to 38 degrees. But then they’ll be told to stay home the next day, to avoid overtime pay.

Incentive to Downsize Hours

The Affordable Care Act is likely to make the short-hours problem worse. A higher education publication reports that colleges in Ohio, Virginia, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania have told adjunct instructors to keep their hours, including prep time, under 30 per week. That’s because the ACA, which takes effect next January, requires employers to grant health benefits to those who work 30 or more.

For the same reason, Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell ordered in February that all part-time state employees work 29 hours or fewer. Walmart’s scheduling software warns managers when workers are approaching enough hours to make them eligible for health care benefits.

Long hours, short hours, or variable schedules don’t just make life miserable for the individual worker and her family. They also make it harder to take collective action. How do you call an after-shift meeting if no one’s shift is the same—or if the work-day is so long that folks can’t wait to get home? How do you socialize outside of work if you can’t find a time when everyone’s free?

In 1995 Labor Notes published a booklet called Time Out! The Case for a Shorter Work Week. Frankly, it wasn’t a big seller. Our readers at the time seemed more interested in working the o.t. than in cutting their hours to 35.

But a Ford worker at the Cleveland Engine Plant, sick of working nine- and 10-hour days, ordered a copy last year. “I gave it to my committeeperson [steward] and then my building chairman and told them both, ‘Read over and over until you get it,’” Teri Norris told me.

Norris’s plant worked the Alternative Work Schedule for 11 months, with mounting absenteeism, injuries, and workers’ comp claims. She made two motions at the local union meeting, for the local to support the eight-hour day, and to petition the international union to support it, too. They gathered more than 600 signatures.

A month ago, the eight-hour day returned to Cleveland Engine.

Get on the Bus

Unions and immigrant rights groups are joining together to march today. In 1886 Chicago, immigrant workers were at the forefront of the fight for decent hours. Today, many run from one part-time job to another, and another, and have even more reason than the rest of us to back the original May Day slogan.

Company was launched by Northeastern University business student in January

Both consumers and developers of apps participate

Since launching%2C the site has featured more than 250 mobile applications

When Sean Casto walks across the stage for graduation on May 3, the Northeastern business student will walk straight into a self-generated career.

A serial entrepreneur, Casto's latest company, PreApps, is pioneering a new model of marketing for the mobile application community that gives developers a chance to rise above the flood of the roughly 30,000 new apps hitting the market each month.

Users can preview upcoming mobile apps, rate them, sign up as beta testers or join a listserv to be notified of any changes – including when a particular app is going to be released through Apple's App Store or Google Play. The service is free to use for developers, although they can upgrade for more detailed analytics and marketing packages.

""We want to help create pre-launch buzz, build brand recognition, but most importantly, build a following behind up-and-coming apps,"" Casto said.

The idea seems intuitive; give the target audience a chance to try out an upcoming app, and in turn, developers have a much clearer picture of what they need to make the launch a success. The concept has even sparked interest from Microsoft, resulting in a partnership that will allow Windows 8 app developers to receive feedback from users before launch.

Mobile is the only entertainment industry that doesn't capitalize on pre-launch buzz, Casto said. ""Why did you watch that movie or buy that phone that's in your pocket? You did so because you watched a trailer, read a review or your friend told you about it.""

He hopes PreApps will make the concept of pre-screening upcoming releases an industry standard for mobile applications through ""an ecosystem that mixes critical user feedback with marketing tools for developers.""

An app user and developer himself, Casto first thought of the idea for a pre-launch platform three years ago. He wasn't able to launch the company until Jan. 24, but since then, interest in the service has boomed.

Since launching, the site has featured more than 250 mobile applications. The Boston-based company's team of six employees searches for the most promising upcoming applications, featuring between five and 10 new apps each day. The platform's exclusive look at apps not yet on the market draws thousands of visitors for daily check-ins on the latest releases.

One of the site's biggest success stories has been Overkill 2, a first-person shooter game that received more than 250,000 downloads following its launch.

Based in the Czech Republic, the game's development company, Craneballs Studios, heard about PreApps through a Czech website that covers mobile news. The idea of a platform to find beta testers and receive feedback from gamers was enough for the studio to give the website a try, said Daniel Craneballs, the company's marketing manager.

""The launch date is incredibly important for any game developer,"" Craneballs said. ""Using PreApps, we managed to secure a respectable buzz before the launch. Overkill 2 received over 500 votes from serious gamers, which is the best group you want to get in touch with.""

Another developer who has found success with the platform is Zhan Ye, a veteran entrepreneur and one of China's first-generation game developers. After PreApps staff saw a video for Ye's upcoming app, Mr. Runner 2: The Masks, they contacted his studio, Zing Games, and brought it onto their website.

""Today's app market is very crowded,"" Ye said. ""It is crucial to use every possible channel to reach the audience and engage the user community as early as possible.""

Casto hopes to offer more than just buzz generation for the developer community.

""We're building this resource for developers to help them create better-quality apps that users will want to download, as well as support them post-launch with development tools, press releases and icon creation,"" Casto said.","Thu, 02 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2013/05/02/banner-large-16_9.jpeg?width=336&height=189&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp,"['buzz', 'marketing', 'preapps', 'builds', 'developer', 'upcoming', 'launch', 'social', 'app', 'marketplace', 'developers', 'apps', 'casto', 'mobile']",

A May Day protest in downtown Seattle turned violent Wednesday night, with police saying they resorted to pepper spray to disperse demonstrators who pelted them with whatever was at hand.

Seattle Police said the crowd tossed rocks, bottles, metal pipes, fireworks -- and even a skateboard.

The clashes left eight officers with injuries, and police said they arrested 17 people, on various offenses including property destruction and assault.

The injured officers suffered mostly bumps and bruises with the exception. One officer, however, was struck in the knee by a fist-sized rock, Seattle Police said.

During the clashes, police deployed flash-bang grenades and tackled unruly protesters to the ground.

One person was arrested, U.S. Park Police said.

81,81,FL-2013-000054-CHN,The Angst in Foggy Bottom – Foreign Policy - Foreign Policy,https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/30/the-angst-in-foggy-bottom/,"The Angst in Foggy Bottom

Last week, when Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, reading from a letter sent from the White House to members of Congress, announced that the U.S. intelligence community believed that the Syrian regime may have used chemical weapons against its own people, the Obama administration wasn’t quite ready for the round-the-clock cable-news frenzy that followed.

Back in August, and on multiple occasions since, President Obama laid out his ""red line"" for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad: Don’t use chemical weapons. But now, reports had been trickling out of Syria for weeks of rebel fighters claiming they had been attacked with mysterious chemical gases. Videos emerged that appeared to show victims foaming at the mouth, in agony. Officials from Britain, France, Israel, and Qatar all said they believed chemical weapons had been used. With Hagel’s remarks, the Obama administration seemed to be confirming that the president’s red line might indeed have been crossed.

But officials told me that as late as Thursday morning, the White House had yet to assemble talking points for the State Department on the subject, a rarity for a White House famously adept at managing 23rd St.’s messaging from Pennsylvania Ave. Just minutes before Secretary of State John Kerry went to brief members of Congress in a closed-door session on Syria, his team was still scrambling to prepare talking points based on the White House letter.

""I think that they just weren’t prepared for that assessment by the intel community — it caught them off guard,"" one State Department official said, referring to the White House. (Another State Department official denied that the administration was unprepared. ""The Hill briefing was long planned and given the decision to release an unclassified letter on Wednesday night, that was naturally a part of what the secretary discussed,"" this person said. ""The language for the briefing and our public language was closely coordinated at every step with the White House. The White House hosted a briefing call with the press."" But the invitation to that call went out only minutes before the briefing.)

As for the White House letter to Congress, it was carefully hedged. ""[O]ur intelligence community does assess with varying degrees of confidence that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale in Syria, specifically the chemical agent sarin,"" it read. ""[O]ur standard of evidence must build on these intelligence assessments as we seek to establish credible and corroborated facts,"" it continued.

The use of qualifiers and the focus on the evidence from the White House is no accident: Past intelligence failures and the public’s war exhaustion loom over the entire discussion of what to do when it comes to Syria. But among many at the State Department, as the death toll from the conflict climbs toward 100,000 people and the refugee population soars into the millions, a sense of ""huge frustration"" is growing, one department source said.

""They are basically doing everything in their power to avoid the slam-dunk scenario that we are all so familiar with,"" said another State Department official, referring to CIA Director George Tenet’s claim to President George W. Bush in the lead up to the Iraq war that there was a ""slam-dunk case"" that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. ""I think the only reason we haven’t intervened is because of the Iraq experience and because of Obama’s thinking about getting out of Iraq and Afghanistan.""

The Obama administration has indeed grown more active on Syria recent months. The United States is sending food and medical supplies to the opposition Supreme Military Command, and a week ago Secretary of State John Kerry announced a doubling of non-lethal support, bringing the total announced aid to the rebels to around $250 million. Last month, President Obama vowed to work with Congress to come up with $200 million more for Jordan as it struggles with a flood of refugees, who now number more than 10 percent of the Jordanian population. A recent Washington Post story noted the stealth delivery of American humanitarian aid to refugees in rebel-held areas and America’s more than $350 million in humanitarian support.

But for many of the officials closest to the Syria issue, the ""mood is, we should have been doing more a long time ago,"" this official said. Elsewhere within the State Department there is sympathy for an Obama administration facing few good options in Syria — alongside a sense the White House should have known this day of red line reckoning would come.

And for some, that translates into great frustration with the Obama administration’s policy on Syria thus far. ""It is borderline isolationist,"" said a third State Department official familiar with deliberations on Syria, referring to the administration’s approach. ""They are learning all the wrong things from Iraq.""

In this official’s view, the White House policy to contain the crisis within Syria’s borders and to force Bashar al-Assad’s regime into negotiations faces slim odds of success because Syria’s ruler sees the conflict as an existential threat to the ruling family. The calculus grew more complicated last week when eight senators forced the White House to share its view of widespread reports of the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons, no matter how much top administration officials couched the language in qualifiers.

""The issue of chemical weapons is extremely problematic for the strategy of containment because it is not even the question of the weapons falling into wrong hands, it is the precedent this is setting,"" said the third official, noting that Turkey and the Arab Gulf states are surely watching to see how the Americans will respond to Syria’s crossing of the proverbial red line. And then of course there is Iran. ""If we are going to demonstrate an inability to respond we could be creating a big problem for us and our allies in the region down the line.""

This official and others who favor greater intervention in the region swiftly acknowledge that there are no risk-free options and a whole slew of problematic and potentially lethal unknowns. But they argue that inaction presents greater risk.

""That is not who we are and what we do and how we have protected our interests for the last 60 years,"" said this official. ""That is not how you do it in the Middle East; you can’t sit back as a country that borders a NATO ally, Iraq, Israel goes up in flames.""

And while it has become popular to invoke the Iraq example, others say Bosnia is the closest parallel given the role of Russia, the ethnic nature of the conflict, and the devastating and escalating number of civilian casualties.

The word ""Dayton"" — referring to the 1995 talks that led to the end of the fighting in the Bosnian war — was heard around the State Department last week, but it means different things to different people. And the White House is keenly aware that the American public has no appetite to engage in a new round of war after a decade of conflict in the Middle East and South Asia that has left more than

6,000 American service members dead. The president campaigned in 2008 on ending the war in Iraq and in 2012 on ending the war in Afghanistan. Getting embroiled in another conflict in the Middle East is not on the White House’s agenda.

""This is a problem they did not want to deal with and then it was just put in front of them in a way that they could not avoid,"" said the first official. ""This is a tricky one. And I have a feeling that, like a lot of these things, there is no good answer.""","Tue, 30 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/state_dept21.jpg?w=625,"['house', 'angst', 'foggy', 'chemical', 'obama', 'war', 'weapons', 'official', 'syria', 'white', 'department', 'state']",

Tuesday April 30 marks the 38th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, the annihilation of South Vietnam by the Communist North, or otherwise popularly known as the end of the Vietnam War. Without this day, I suspect there wouldn't be as many Vietnamese restaurants in your 'hood. And, without this day, certainly I wouldn't be where I am today to update you on what's been happening since then.

Having spent nearly two decades abroad before I decided to return to Vietnam back in 2007, I am often asked by people I meet on my travels about my growing up in post-war Vietnam after 1975 and how the country is doing. And what strikes me as fascinating is the fact that when I ask back what they already know about the country, there seems to be only two versions of Vietnam available:

The first is filled with horror stories and images of a ravaged land once torn by an American-led war. And the second is of a new emerging economic tiger in the Far East, the exotic 'it' destination for the young and the famous.

Brad and Angelina have kept coming back. Jeez, they even adopted a little Vietnamese boy not too long ago. While hordes of backpackers from Australia, Europe and across America have diligently followed their Lonely Planet mantra and dropped in from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, the new name for Saigon, to marvel at its culture and beauty or to sample a bowl of ""pho"" (beef noodles) before beginning their day on a shoestring budget. They could see with their own eyes that it is all peaceful now and that the people seem happy and content with their newfound fortune.

Or at least it seems that way. Until I inform them otherwise.

You see, like the other 2 million Vietnamese who have left the country since that fateful day 38 years ago, my family came to Australia as refugees in the aftermath of the war. We were in fact part of the first ever exodus of Vietnamese leaving our homeland. Despite multiple wars with our northern neighbor China throughout history, a century old independent struggle against French colonialism and a devastating famine caused by the Japanese during World War II, followed by the Vietnam War until 1975, our people have always stayed put and stoically chosen Vietnam as their home, their land -- despite all the bloodshed and all the losses.

But for the very first time in our history, soon after the war had ended, people started to leave. First there was a trickle, then later a flood as tens of thousands left by boat and on foot heedless of the dangers on the high sea and what awaits them on the other side. Though estimates range, about 10% of all boat people never made it to shore.

This inspires the question: Why flee the peace?

The answer is simple. Even though war has ended and peace has triumphed, truth and justice have never prevailed in my homeland. The current U.N. Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of assembly, Maina Kiai, recently referred to this as a ""peace coma."" That in the name of peace, we choose to ignore flagrant violations of the most basic human rights by the world's most repressive regimes.

Three months after April 30, 1975, my dad, along with hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese officers and intellectuals, were duly sent to ""re-education"" camps without trial. Upon his release three years after, he was not allowed to work as a teacher again but instead, like other families deemed ""anti-revolutionary,"" we were evicted from our home in Saigon and forced to relocate to ""new economic"" zones to make way for a new Utopian socialist state.

This created the first wave of boat people from Vietnam. My dad was one of them.

The new communist victors then set out to nationalize all businesses and embark on a new socialist economic platform, where properties and land titles belong to the state rather than individuals.

This created the second wave of refugees from Vietnam, and it only stopped when Hanoi realized that continuing to do so would lead to a total collapse of the country's economy and with that, the entire social and political system. Assisted by the spirit of ""perestroika"" in the former Soviet Union in the late 1980s, party leaders then began a series of economic reforms that for the past two decades have helped lift Vietnam out of abject poverty.

But its social and political systems remain unchanged and, to this day, all land still belongs to the state and hundreds of dissidents still remain in prison for challenging the one-party rule of the Vietnamese Communist Party. Facebook is banned, no independent news media are allowed, protests are forbidden and civil rights defenders face constant harassment and persecution. Some in the end have to flee, seeking asylum elsewhere while others stay and face imprisonment for up to 16 years for speaking out.

The brutal truth is that there are still refugees from Vietnam. Neither peace nor justice has ever been achieved in my homeland.

My question often then is: Where are all the well-meaning anti-Vietnam War protesters of the 1960s and '70s? Have they not cared to learn about what happened thereafter? More important, what can they do now to help make it a better and freer place?

Like they all had so passionately professed to care four decades ago.

Berger deconstructs the climate change denialists’ myths in simple, easy-to-read terms.

According to the Pew Research Center: “Nearly seven-in-ten (69%) [Americans] say there is solid evidence that the earth’s average temperature has been getting warmer over the past few decades, up six points since November 2011 and 12 points since 2009.” Yet implementing national-level climate change mitigation legislation is not occurring in the U.S. This is not because we lack scientific evidence. This is not because we do not know what actions to take. This is because of wordsmithing and marketing of ideas, conflating scientific concepts, obscuring reality, and deliberately applying denialism tactics within public discourse. Denialism is a culture of denying an established fact. This exhibited when a person or group chooses to refuse to believe a theory, fact, or evidence of well-established authoritative discipline.

When institutions choose to ignore the facts surrounding climate change, instead of pursuing to debate these institutions based on scientific logic, we can choose to debate their logic based on rhetorical theory. Dr. John J. Berger provides us these tools in Climate Myths: The Campaign Against Climate Science.

He describes the origins of the climate “debate”, the strategy of purposeful climate “disinformation”, and conflation of arguments used as a way to disrupt appropriate prudent immediate action.

AN INTERVIEW WITH JOHN J. BERGER

Mongabay: John Berger: , thank you for discussing climate “myths” with us. What inspired you to write Climate Myths: The Campaign Against Climate Science?

John Berger: : After following global warming issues for more than 30 years, I became concerned that despite the growing climate emergency, climate change is not being taken seriously enough by government or the people, and that much of the public is being seriously misled by arguments sponsored by the fossil fuel industry. The industrial opposition to climate science and climate-safe energy policies has grown more sophisticated and varied over the past decade. It operates through dozens of industry-funded institutes, policy centers, councils, research foundations, and societies that speak for industry on climate and energy. Their strategy has often been to hide the sponsorship and the ideologically based misrepresentations of climate science beneath a mantle of science.

I have watched for a long time now as the fossil fuel industry has put forward a succession of meritless arguments and has somehow gotten phenomenal traction with them. For example, I watched in 1997 while their arguments persuaded the Senate to reject the Kyoto Protocol, the first international agreement that strove to limit the emission of CO2 and other heat-trapping gases. Had the U.S. embraced this very modest agreement and taken the lead internationally by showing a seriousness to reduce heat-trapping gas emissions, we would have a great deal more leverage today in negotiating with developing countries which are rapidly expanding their heat-trapping gas emissions and furthermore, I daresay the world would be a lot closer today to lowering global emissions to protect the climate.

Earlier, in 1993, industry opposition halted the Clinton Administration’s efforts to pass a modest tax on the energy content of fuels, which would have helped control carbon emissions. This intervention set back the nation’s efforts to control its emissions by at least 20 years. Climate Myths is my response to the flood of misinformation that has blocked progress on climate change policy and legislation for far too long.

In the book, I not only try to rebut specific misleading claims about climate science, but I also try to offer insights into why so little progress has been made domestically and in international negotiations to cut greenhouse gas emissions at the rate and scale needed. If we as a society are to meet the climate threats we face now, people really need to understand the political and economic motivation behind climate science denial and how it’s been deliberately fostered by the fossil fuel industry.

Mongabay: What signs do you see that climate change “myths” are being replaced with scientific, reality based conversation?

John Berger: : To some extent, the conversation is changing, but not enough. On the plus side, President Obama in his Inaugural Address vowed to take action on climate change and correctly stated that failure to act would betray our children and future generations. He referred dismissively to denial of climate science, which he contrasted with “the overwhelming judgment of science” on climate change.



John J. Berger.

He repeated these themes in his State of the Union Address and added that we can either choose to believe that all the extreme weather of the past 15 years is pure coincidence, or we can believe—and he used the phrase again, in “the overwhelming judgment of science.” Then he outlined important actions that his Administration is taking or will take to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. That’s a dramatic contrast to the Bush-Cheney Administration, which preceded Obama and was a staunch supporter of the fossil fuel industry. Remember, both President Bush and Vice President Cheney were oil industry executives.

When you look at public attitudes on climate change, the polling is a bit inconsistent but you can see that we still have a long way to go. Some 42% of Americans polled by Gallup this month do not believe climate change will ever happen or believe it will happen at some time in the future. Only about half the population even understands that climate change has already begun.

A Duke University poll came to the conclusion that whereas only half the population thinks climate change is happening, roughly another third think it’s probably happening. So when you total the two groups, more people now think human activity causes climate change than at any time since 2007. But there’s a sharp ideological divide on this issue. Whereas 70 percent of Democrats are convinced the climate is changing, only 27 percent of Republicans do. It is disheartening to see decisions about nonpolitical scientific issues reached based on political ideology. I think that’s a reflection of the way the issue has been politicized by the fossil fuel industry and its allies.

That is only possible because, unfortunately, much of the American public today does not really understand science very well—our educational system has let them down. Many people therefore do not understand the scientific method, scientific reasoning, critical thinking, peer review, or what a scientific theory is or is not. And climate science is particularly complex science. It involves many other sciences from atmospheric physics to oceanography and so on. Therefore, without scientific training and knowledge, many well-intentioned people have genuine difficulty understanding what climate scientists are trying to tell them.

Mongabay: What do you think are the most pervasive and destructive climate myths currently being propagated?

John Berger: : I think the most pernicious myths are that contemporary climate change is being produced by natural causes not by human activities and that we therefore have no control over, nor any responsibility for, what is going on. Nearly 40 percent of Americans polled by Gallup this month still hold to this incorrect opinion that current climate change is natural. Another serious misconception is that global warming is not going to be a threat in our lifetime. A third destructive myth is that climate change will be mild and that we can reverse it at will by simply making some modest changes at our leisure in how much carbon dioxide we emit. People simply don’t understand that we are already in a global emergency and that positive climate feedback, climate thresholds, climate tipping points combined with what we’re doing to the climate today put us at great risk of triggering catastrophic climate changes that are irreversible on any timescale meaningful to present generations–and conceivable future generations as well.

Mongabay: What are the rhetorical tools used by climate change denialists and how can institutions challenge this rhetoric with positive proactive rhetoric?

John Berger: : One favorite tool is to raise spurious yet plausible sounding questions that confuse the nonprofessional. It is easy enough to pose a thorny, misleading question. It then may take a great deal of expert time and effort to conclusively demonstrate the incorrect nature of the assumptions underlying the question. Another favorite tactic is to cherry pick the evidence. Another is to make ad hominem arguments, for example, that climate scientists are distorting or exaggerating the scientific evidence to attract more research funding. Still other rhetorical devices involve use of logical fallacies, or misrepresenting the facts. Another favorite tactic is to propound unprovable conspiracy theories, like “global warming is a hoax.” These tactics are well described in an excellent book by Hayden Washington and John Cook called, Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand. James Lawrence Powell also has a very good book out about climate science denial called, The Inquisition of Climate Science. There’s no magic rhetorical bullet to defeat misguided climate arguments. The only effective way to defeat them is with knowledge of the facts and the truth.

Mongabay: How would you recommend institutions and citizens be proactive, as opposed to reactive, in addressing climate change “myths” as propagated by the denialists?

John Berger: : Become as well informed about these issues as you can be and speak up when nonsense is spoken. In Climate Myths: The Campaign Against Climate Science I provide pages and pages of reliable information sources that people can use to become well informed about climate change. I am also about to release a second book on climate change called, Climate Peril: The Intelligent Reader’s Guide to Understanding the Climate Crisis. You can find more about it on my website, www.johnjberger.com.

Mongabay: One way I have challenged denialist rhetoric is to ask them to explain to me “where is the data wrong?” and another way to challenge denialist rhetoric would be to mock them with humor. Do you have rhetorical advice on how to use humor to challenge denialist rhetoric?

John Berger: : I suppose you could carry their arguments to absurd length. For example if someone were trying to tell me that global warming is good, I might say, well I understand the importance of growing pineapples in Greenland and raising crocodiles in the Arctic, but is it really worth flooding lower Manhattan? Alternatively, with respect to sea level rise, perhaps you could refer to the benefits of all the new beachfront property that will be created in backyards along the coast thanks to sea level rise.

Mongabay: What is one thing you would like each of Mongabay’s global readers to do today after reading you interview?

John Berger: : I discuss this question at some length in an interview for the international online magazine Synchronized Chaos. My short answer is, become as knowledgeable as you can about climate change and then, guided by an awareness of your own skills and abilities and how you can be most effective, spring into action. If we remain passive and assume that others will take care this for us, we are complicit in the bad outcome that is likely to ensue. As Carl Sagan said, “Don’t sit this one out. Do something. You are by accident of fate alive at an absolutely critical moment in the history of our planet.” As I said in that Synchronized Chaos interview (http://synchchaos.com/?p=7560 ), “We don’t have time any more to lament the situation or make excuses for inaction. Everyone can do something. We need all hands on deck. Be determined. Fight the good fight. Do something, no matter how insignificant you may think it is. Chances are you have more power and influence than you think. Millions of other people are out there who already silently agree with you. They will stand up if you do. Use your power. Amazing and tremendous things have been done and will be done by committed individuals.”

Updated at 7:15 a.m. EST Vice President Joe Biden in a visit to Kiev urged policymakers Tuesday to remove the ""cancer of corruption"" from Ukrainian society as the White House warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that time is running short for Moscow to rein in pro-Russian separatists in accordance with an agreement struck last week. ""The opportunity to generate a united Ukraine, getting it right, is within your grasp. And we want to be your partner and friend in the project. We want to assist,"" Biden said. ""You have to fight the cancer of corruption that is endemic in your system right now,"" Biden said in a meeting with nine members of the Rada, Ukraine's parliament. He urged the legislators to enact meaningful constitutional reforms and offered Washington's assistance as the country prepares for national elections on May 25. Biden met earlier in the day with Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov to discuss economic and technical assistance amid the ongoing crisis sparked by last month's occupation and annexation of Crimea. He landed in Kiev Monday. In a briefing in Washington Monday, White House press secretary Jay Carney said Moscow could face further sanctions if it doesn't pull back Kremlin-backed insurgents occupying government buildings throughout the country's restive east. “If there is not progress within days, we remain prepared, along with our European and G-7 partners, to impose additional costs on Russia for its destabilizing actions,"" he said . During a question-and-answer session on Twitter, U.S. State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki appeared to up the ante when she conceded that the U.S. government would consider levying further sanctions against the Russian leadership, including measures targeting Putin personally, if efforts to de-escalate the crisis in Ukraine failed. ""Yes. [Important] to lay out consequences. U.S. able to sanction people, companies, and sectors. Goal not sanctions. Goal de-escalation,"" tweeted Psaki. ""Range of officials under consideration. Plenty to sanction before we would discuss President #Putin."" According to the deal reached in Switzerland on Friday between the U.S., Russia, the E.U. and Ukraine, “all illegal armed groups must be disarmed, all illegally seized buildings must be returned to legitimate owners.” In the four days since, pro-Russian forces have shown few signs of acknowledging the Geneva agreement. While many of the protesters camped out at government buildings throughout eastern Ukraine are locals, analysts and the U.S. government increasingly agree they are being supported by Russian special forces . In Moscow on Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov dismissed the use of ultimatums by U.S. officials and accused Washington of colluding with fascist elements in Ukraine. “Before giving us ultimatums, demanding that we fulfill demands within two or three days with the threat of sanctions, we would urgently call on our American partners to fully accept responsibility for those who they brought to power,” said Lavrov, according to Russia Today . Tensions in eastern Ukraine remain high in the wake of a deadly shoot-out in Slavyansk on Sunday night between progovernment and separatist forces. Reports also surfaced that separatist groups had detained at least three foreign journalists in the city on Monday. This article was updated with comments from Vice President Joe Biden in Kiev.

Upstart Internet video company Aereo will square off against the nation's largest TV broadcasters on Tuesday in one of the most closely watched Supreme Court cases involving the media business in years. The outcome of the case could have important implications for Internet streaming, cloud computing, and the future of the TV industry itself. Aereo, a two-year-old startup backed by media mogul Barry Diller, has infuriated the major broadcasters because the company pays nothing to capture free, over-the-air TV programming using thousands of dime-sized antennas that are rented to individual users. Aereo then transmits that content to its customers over the Internet for $8-$12 per month. The broadcasters, including ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX, say this amounts to blatant theft. If the Supreme Court rules that Aereo’s service is legal, the decision could throw a wrench into the highly lucrative broadcast business model, in which cable and satellite companies pay billions to the TV companies for the right to broadcast popular programming. Such retransmission fees are projected to reach $4 billion this year and $7.6 billion by 2019, according to research firm SNL Kagan. The broadcasters say that an Aereo victory could prompt them to yank their programming from free TV and move it to pay channels like Showtime. The National Football League and Major League Baseball, which are supporting the TV companies, have threatened to take high-profile broadcasts like the Super Bowl and World Series to cable. Aereo says such a move would ""disenfranchise"" millions of Americans who still rely on antennas for local news and other programming. Last year, two federal courts agreed with Aereo’s argument that it is transmitting thousands of legally protected ""private performances"" that individuals have captured using their own leased antennas housed in Aereo's antenna farms. Those verdicts relied on principles established by the landmark 2008 Cablevision decision , which allowed remote DVR technology. But in February, a federal judge in Utah sided with the broadcasters, intensifying the legal uncertainty surrounding Aereo. ""Based on the Cablevision remote DVR verdict, a one-to-one relationship between the consumer’s copy or the antenna driving the stream to the consumer is what the law requires,"" Aereo CEO Chet Kanojia told TIME in a recent interview . ""We looked at that verdict and set out to comply with the law to the fullest extent possible, and we created a great technology that is solving a real consumer problem and bringing choice to the marketplace."" The TV broadcasters say that Aereo is simply ripping them off. ""Nothing about Aereo’s convoluted scheme of miniature antennas and gratuitous copies exempts its commercial retransmission service from the same rules that govern all others,"" the companies wrote in their brief . ""Aereo’s unauthorized retransmission of broadcast television to the public is obvious and unambiguous copyright infringement."" Several prominent legal experts agree, including U.S. Second Circuit Judge Denny Chin, who called Aereo ""a sham"" and a ""Rube Goldberg-like contrivance, over-engineered in an attempt to avoid the reach of the Copyright Act and to take advantage of a perceived loophole in the law."" Judge Chin made those comments in a dissent to the Second Circuit verdict that found Aereo's service to be legal, and is now being challenged by the broadcasters in the Supreme Court. In March, the Obama administration filed a friend of the court brief claiming that Aereo is ""liable for infringement."" Last week, Diller, the billionaire media mogul who has poured millions of dollars into Aereo, blasted the White House for signaling ""that the preservation of legacy business models takes precedence over lawful technological innovation."" Meanwhile, several well-known public interest and technology advocacy groups have backed Aereo, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Public Knowledge, the Consumer Electronics Association, and Engine Advocacy. Dozens of prominent law professors and legal scholars are also supporting Aereo. ""Aereo simply provides an antenna for viewers to privately transmit free over-the-air broadcast television signals,"" says Jodie Griffin, Senior Staff Attorney at Public Knowledge. ""It does nothing more than make it easier for viewers to access already free broadcast service."" Technology advocates warn that a ruling against Aereo could imperil cloud computing services offered by companies like Google, Amazon and Dropbox, because Aereo relies on the same legal principles as the entire cloud-computing industry, a point that Kanojia made in the TIME interview . ""The Aereo case puts the cloud at risk because when broadcasters have complained about Aereo, their complaints also describe cloud computing,"" according to Matt Schruers, vice president for law & policy at the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which is supporting Aereo. When they appear before the Supreme Court on Tuesday, the TV broadcasters will marshal significant legal firepower to make the case that Aereo is illegal. The companies will be represented by Paul D. Clement , the former Solicitor General under George W. Bush who is widely regarded as one of the most skilled and experienced Supreme Court lawyers of his generation. Oral argument begins at 11 a.m. on Tuesday. Lars Tunbjörk for The New York Times

MORE: One after-effect of the Great Recession is on display now at car dealerships—where there are more and more used cars for sale, at increasingly lower prices. The used car market has gone a bit haywire over the last half-dozen years. During the height of the Great Recession, new auto sales of all shapes, sizes, and variations tanked. As a result of relatively few new cars being purchased, there were fewer used cars on the market during the years that followed—years when the economy was still struggling, when demand for cheap vehicles was understandably high, and when used car prices soared because there weren't enough pre-owned vehicles for sale to keep up with demand. Signs of a softening in used car prices began appearing around 2012, and now and in the years to come, consumers can expect better pricing and a more robust selection of most models. In particular, a trend that's stretched for several years in the lease market will soon result in a ""used-car flood"" at auto dealerships, as Automotive News put it. Leasing, which slumped during the peak recession years, has rebounded considerably lately. In 2009, according to Edmunds.com , consumers scooped up only 1.5 million or so new cars via three-year lease, down from nearly 2 million the year before. Fast-forward three years after that low for leasing, and in 2012 there were only about 1.5 million off-lease used cars hitting the market—an exceptionally small number compared to the high of 3.4 million in 2002, per the Manheim Used Car Market report . ( With Auto Sales Slumping Car Dealerships Will Wheel and Deal ) Because the pace of used-car leases has picked up each year after 2009, so too have the ranks of used cars going up for sale three years later, when the lease terms are up. This year, roughly 2.1 million off-lease vehicles will be back on the market, up from 1.7 million in 2013. Next year, the number of off-lease used cars for sale should swell to 2.5 million, and in 2016 and for the foreseeable future, Manheim predicts that there will be more than 3 million off-lease vehicles returning to the market annually. Add in the fact that cars have increasingly longer life spans , and we're seeing an across-the-board rise in supply of used cars—and the increasing supply is projected to translate to lower prices. Earlier this year, Edmunds.com forecast that used-car prices would slide 2% in 2014, and perhaps further down the road as a result of leasing trends. ""Many car shoppers might not realize how much the new- and used-car markets feed off each other,"" explained Edmunds.com Sr. Consumer Advice Editor Philip Reed. ""The boom in new car leases, for example, is leading to a higher number of lease returns, which adds to the growing inventory of used cars, forcing their prices down."" The news isn't all good for consumers, however. A decrease in used-car prices also means that drivers will get less for used vehicles they're trading in or selling. That shiny new car you purchase is likely to lose its value more quickly than it would have in the recent past. Individual car buyers also tend to simultaneously be sellers of their older cars, and from the looks of things, it'll be a buyer's market for quite some time. David Guttenfelder / AP

If you think things look bad for General Motors now, they looked even worse back in the summer of 2005. Its finances were shaky, its models were unloved and the big carmaker’s future was very much in doubt. So it had a lot riding on the reviews of its newest line of small cars that was supposed to help it shift away from the slowing SUV sales it had relied on for years. Which is why the review of the Chevy Cobalt in the New York Times on June 19, 2005 was such good news for the company. The Times called the Cobalt “a good car, if not a great one,” a “creditable competitor” to comparable Toyota and Honda models, and one of several new GM models that were “vastly improved and generally likeable.” Sadly, no one in top management read the article, according to current GM officials who are currently scrambling to manage the PR fallout of the belated recall of Cobalts earlier this year. Or at least, say the current officials, no top managers read the sidebar story that ran next to the main review and reported on a troubling phenomenon: intermittent stalling of the Chevy Cobalt and loss of electrical power due to a problem with the ignition system. GM now claims top managers only learned of the Cobalt’s ignition system problems this year, and only mid- and low-level officials have been punished. But the coverage of the ignition issue in the Times and elsewhere in June 2005 raises uncomfortable questions for GM, and for at least one former official from the time who is seeking public office. The Times review was highlighted in documents released by the House oversight committee earlier this month, and was referenced in documents released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration over Easter weekend. It reported that Chevy was telling dealers that drivers could accidentally cut power to the car's engine and should be told to lighten the load on their keyrings. It cited one example of the cutoff occurring when the reviewer's wife was driving the car, and it quoted a reviewer in a small Pennsylvania paper who said the problem happened four times in a week of testing the car. A week after the Times review, the Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote about the problem. And the House oversight committee also published a statement that had been released in June 2005 by a GM spokesman, Alan Adler, acknowledging the ignition problem and saying that dealers and “service advisers” had been told to tell customers to remove items from their keyrings that might be contributing to the shutoff problem. Apparently only good news made it up the chain to top managers in 2005, however. In comments to the media and GM employees on Oct. 17, 2005, then-CEO Rick Wagoner praised the market success of the Cobalt and other new models, saying “these products have been well-received by the enthusiasts and general press.” Wagoner was forced out as part of GM’s restructuring during the government bailout of the company in 2009 and has largely stayed out of the spotlight since then. Not all top officials from that time may find it so easy to stay out of the GM recall story as it unfolds, however. Debbie Dingell was GM’s Executive Director of External Affairs and Constituent Relations in 2005, overseeing the company’s marketing strategies, community relations and its relationships with labor, suppliers, dealers, business organizations and constituency groups. She too retired from GM in 2009. But after her husband John Dingell, the long-serving Congressman from Michigan’s 15th district, announced his retirement in February this year, she announced she would run for his seat. Debbie Dingell declined to answer questions about the 2005 coverage of the ignition shutoff problem. However, she said through a spokeswoman that she knew nothing about the troubles besetting the Cobalts and other small cars when she worked for GM. “Her responsibilities were not related to the engineering and design segment of the business and she was not part of the management group related to or responsible for recall decisions,” says Liz Boyd, Dingell’s spokeswoman. Boyd says Dingell was not aware of the articles in the Times or the Plain Dealer and was not aware of the instructions sent to dealers and service managers regarding the ignition cut-off problem. GM has named a former federal prosecutor to investigate what the company knew about the problem as it unfolded. Company spokesman Greg Martin said of the 2005 Times story, ""It was printed in the paper and we'll have further information as it becomes available."" John Moore / Getty Images

Australia's platinum-blond rapstress Iggy Azalea swaggered onto the scene in 2011 with an aggressive ode to cunnilingus (whose title can't be repeated here), but it's been the T.I. mentee's accent, not her sexual confidence, that's ruffled the most feathers in the lead-up to her debut LP, The New Classic, out today. Azalea, 23, raps in a geographically ambitious drawl she's picked from her idols and stints in various American cities; often it's a deal-breaker. You can find it endearing or fake. You can admire her studied dedication to artists she loves, or you can dismiss it as white privilege in action. Azalea defends her style as a technical necessity , but a New York Times story about her fashion career suggests a different philosophy at play: “I know how to play the game and get what I want,” Azalea told the paper . “Do you think what I wore to the Chloé show would really be something that I would wear? No. I picked the outfit out myself, because I know it’s appropriate and I know how to pander."" As she warned on her trunk-rattling rags-to-riches tale ""Work,"" you can hate it or love it. Or try to love it, at least. Azalea gets brownie points for the gutsy name, but simply calling your record a classic does not a classic make — rather, her debut is a paint-by-numbers exercise in what a modern rap album should be: a song name-dropping brands here, a chilled-out track asking for alone-time and admonishing hanger-ons there. Beyoncé may have hand-picked Azalea to go on tour , but when Azalea demands listeners ""bow down to a goddess,"" there's rather little incentive to obey. In the past year, Azalea found her footing after a few false starts with a solid string of singles that combined the intrigue of her origin story with hefty beats from producers like The Invisible Men, who handle the most of the tracks here. After discovering Tupac as a teen in small-town Australia, Azalea (born Amethyst Kelly) dropped out of high school, saved up money working dead-end jobs and told her family she was going on a vacation — then never came back. The autobiographical ""Work"" is by the far the best thing she's done, and it's no coincidence that The New Classic's strongest material — the T.I.-assisted ""Change Your Life,"" the guns-blazing opener ""Walk the Line"" — also address her unusual American dream with similar conviction and rapid-fire (if at times obnoxiously forced) delivery. But the story wears out its welcome not long after, suggesting she's perhaps already run out of things to say on her supposed classic: The platitudes of ""Impossible Is Nothing"" await whoever didn't finish putting in their 10,000 hours on Macklemore's own you-can-do-it-too anthem. Azalea has said before that she resisted making a pop record because she was dedicated to rap. In its final form, The New Classic suffers for trying to have it both ways. Her most successful single is ""Fancy,"" which features a redeeming hook by alt-pop siren Charli XCX and probably owes a good chunk of its success to the Alicia Silverstone-approved Clueless homage. The most likely candidates for future singles aren't the ones where Azalea attempts a new personal best in words-per-minute, but where she aims for melody (""New Bitch"") or outsources that job to someone else (especially Rita Ora on the ""Dark Horse"" sequel ""Black Widow""). Often, the songs don't feel like her own. That may say less about her personal tastes, though, and more about what it actually takes to be a successful female rapper in 2014: Since Azalea dropped her first mixtape in 2011, fans have watched Azealia Banks flounder and Angel Haze bust her way out of release-date purgatory only to bomb. Nicki Minaj's bipolar sophomore album and success with ""Super Bass"" and ""Starships"" reveal industry incentive to both spit a mean 16 and impress Taylor Swift , and Iggy Azalea has more or less said the same herself. ""I do believe the reason people group me and Angel Haze and Azealia Banks all in the same category,"" she said last year , ""is that none of us have had a hit yet, and once one of us has a hit, we won't be in that same category, and I want to be the first.""

A fresh bout of violence broke out on Sunday in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, the BBC reports . Demonstrators opposed to the government of President Nicolas Maduro were beaten back by police with water cannons and tear gas after launching petrol bombs in the district of Chacao. Other masked protestors burned effigies of the president in a day of demonstrations entitled “Rally for Democracy.” The demonstrations began in February when protestors demanded action against Venezuela’s high rates of crime and food shortages, and spiraling inflation rate. Over 40 people have died in the continuing violence, with hundreds arrested. Supporters of the president have also been protesting, with tens of thousands of people dressed in red taking to the streets. But many within the opposition movement have vowed to keep demonstrating until Maduro leaves power. “We’re staying in the street until we get our country back,” 22-year-old student leader Djamil Jassir told the BBC.

Note: Spoilers ahead. Fans of both Game of Thrones the TV show and Game of Thrones the book series likely noticed a Fans of both Game of Thrones the TV show and Game of Thrones the book series likely noticed a disturbing plot discrepancy between the two while watching Sunday night's episode ""Breaker of Chains,"" when Jaime Lannister raped his sister Cersei beside the body of their dead son. While plot changes aren't unheard of for the HBO show, what made this particular scene so controversial is that in George R. R. Martin's book, the sex is portrayed as consensual (albeit still incestuous and horribly morbid). While the episode's director Alex Graves told Vulture that the scene ""was meant to be consensual,"" viewers couldn't justifiably argue that it was portrayed that way. Cersei says ""no,"" ""don't"" and struggles throughout the entire scene. If consent was given, it didn't make the final cut. After the episode set off both fans and critics, Martin himself has weighed in on the scene in the comments of his blog to speculate why the show chose to make such a change: I think the ""butterfly effect"" that I have spoken of so often was at work here. In the novels, Jaime is not present at Joffrey's death, and indeed, Cersei has been fearful that he is dead himself, that she has lost both the son and the father/ lover/ brother. And then suddenly Jaime is there before her. Maimed and changed, but Jaime nonetheless. Though the time and place is wildly inappropriate and Cersei is fearful of discovery, she is as hungry for him as he is for her. The whole dynamic is different in the show, where Jaime has been back for weeks at the least, maybe longer, and he and Cersei have been in each other's company on numerous occasions, often quarreling. The setting is the same, but neither character is in the same place as in the books, which may be why Dan & David played the sept out differently. But that's just my surmise; we never discussed this scene, to the best of my recollection. Martin has discussed his theory of ""the butterfly effect"" before , which centers on the idea that any deviation the show makes from his intricate plot will logically lead to further deviations later on. Regarding Jaime and Cersei's scene, Martin keenly noted another crucial difference between the books and the TV series, namely that the books tell the story from different characters' point of views. Due to the nature of television, scenes can't quite be cast in that way: I was writing the scene from Jaime's POV, so the reader is inside his head, hearing his thoughts. On the TV show, the camera is necessarily external. You don't know what anyone is thinking or feeling, just what they are saying and doing. If the show had retained some of Cersei's dialogue from the books, it might have left a somewhat different impression -- but that dialogue was very much shaped by the circumstances of the books, delivered by a woman who is seeing her lover again for the first time after a long while apart during which she feared he was dead. I am not sure it would have worked with the new timeline. That's really all I can say on this issue. The scene was always intended to be disturbing... but I do regret if it has disturbed people for the wrong reasons. [ Vanity Fair Nick Turpin

Interviews and Talks

A day before U.S. President Barack Obama is due to arrive in Tokyo, 147 Japanese legislators visited the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japanese war dead, including top war criminals convicted of orchestrating imperial Japan’s appalling Asia campaigns. Japan’s polarizing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was not among the worshippers. Instead, he sent a traditional tree offering the day before. Tuesday's Yasukuni pilgrimage took place during a spring festival of the Shinto faith and included one Cabinet-level official. In December, when Abe became the first of Japan’s last seven leaders to worship at Yasukuni, the U.S. embassy in Tokyo expressed its disappointment. Reaction in China and South Korea, two nations most ravaged by imperial Japan’s excesses, was far angrier. Since Abe took office in December 2012 — after a campaign in which he talked tough on China and called for a potential revision to a Japanese apology to wartime Asian sex slaves — Japan’s relations with Beijing have cooled. Territorial disputes in the East China Sea and historical grievances over Japan’s attitude toward its wartime past have even affected the two nations’ trade ties. (On April 21, more than 270 activists, including descendants of Japanese war dead, filed a suit at a Tokyo court, alleging that Abe’s December visit to Yasukuni Shrine contravened Japan’s postwar constitution, which was written by the Americans to ensure the country’s commitment to peace.) Obama is to spend two nights in Tokyo, underscoring the long-standing security alliance between the two nations and pushing for a trade pact that is facing domestic opposition in both countries. As part of an Asia trip that was postponed last year because of the American government shutdown, the Commander in Chief will also visit South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. (He will not make a stop in China.) Obama will be arriving in a region noticeably tenser than when he last visited. Last year, after years of Chinese double-digit military-budget hikes, Japan upped its defense budget for the first time in more than a decade. Tokyo’s defense commitments also increased this year as well, and Abe has made clear his ambitions of normalizing a Japanese military that is precluded by the postwar constitution from many military maneuvers. On April 19, Japan broke ground on a radar facility near islands that both Tokyo and Beijing claim; it is the first new deployment of Japanese armed forces in four decades. Since 2012, when Japan nationalized some of the disputed islands, China and Japan’s military movements in and above these contested waters have markedly increased, although they appear to have dropped over the past six months. The same day as the ceremony for the future radar station on Japan’s Yonaguni Island, a maritime court in Shanghai seized a Japanese-owned ship docked at a nearby port in order to fulfill a 1930s-era contract. The ship was impounded as payment for two Chinese-owned ships leased long ago by a Japanese firm; those two carriers were commandeered by the imperial Japanese government during the Sino-Japanese war and were lost at sea. On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said the court decision “has nothing to do with Chinese-Japanese war compensation.” But Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga expressed “deep concern,” saying the impounding of the container ship — which is owned by Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, the company that is the successor to the original Japanese lessee — could have an “intimidating effect on Japanese companies doing business in China.” Was the timing of the Shanghai court’s decision, which derived from a 1988 lawsuit filed by descendants of the lost Chinese ships’ owners, a coincidence? Perhaps. But when it comes to relations between Asia’s two biggest powers, history has a way of forcing itself into the present. Fabio Bucciarelli / AFP

During the Angie Martinez Show earlier today, the radio jock and many other Hot 97 personalities came together to announce this year's lineup, which includes rappers and singers from across the nation.

Wale was the first artist to be named as a performer gracing the stage. This is the Maybach Music Group signee's fourth time performing at the event. He'll likely perform his current track 'Bad Girls.' Next up is 2 Chainz, whose debut album, 'Based on a T.R.U. Story,' spawned such hits as 'I'm Different,' 'Birthday Song' and 'No Lie.'

West Coast emcee Kendrick Lamar will grab the mic to treat fans to songs like 'Poetic Justice' and 'Swimming Pools (Drank).' Also, the entire Wu-Tang Clan are uniting to perform at Summer Jam. Surely their supporters will be graced with classic tunes like 'C.R.E.A.M.' and 'Triumph,' among others.

Fabulous, who's preparing to release his sixth studio LP, 'Loso's Way 2: Rise to Power,' is part of the lineup as well as 'No Love Lost' creator Joe Budden, 'How Many Drinks' crooner Miguel and 'Fine China' singer Chris Brown.

New York natives A$AP Rocky and French Montana are also scheduled to make appearances on the stage, performing tracks from their 'Long.Live.A$AP' and 'Excuse My French' albums, respectively.

This marks the 20-year anniversary of Summer Jam, taking place June 2 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. Like in year's past, surprise guests are sure to flood the stage. Before the big show kicks off, Joey Bada$$, A$AP Ferg, Action Bronson, Smoke DZA, Troy Ave, Vinny Cha$e, Bodega Bamz, Kid Ink and the winner of the 2013 Who’s Next Battle for the Best, Radamiz, will take the mic too on the Festival Village stage.","Thu, 02 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://townsquare.media/site/584/files/2013/05/2chainzchrisbrownasaprockymiguel.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89,"['performing', 'jam', 'french', 'chainz', 'rocky', 'lineup', 'welcomes', 'summer', 'hot', 'chris', 'stage', 'xx', 'perform', 'whos', 'mic', 'brown']",

Add to the list of step-downs to the mid-range, Lustre-based storage company, Xyratex, which today announced a pared down version of its ClusterStor offering targeted at departmental-level HPC.

The ClusterStor 1500 is targeted at mid-range users with a fully integrated Lustre-based solution that Xyratex says will help puddle-jump acquisition hassles. The goal is to let time and TCO-conscious mini-HPC’ers scale linearly and free themselves from the limitations of NFS-based approaches.

We talked with Xyratex’s Senior VP of the ClusterStor line, Ken Claffey, who told us that there’s real value in the emerging market of smaller-scale HPC shops that have powerful x86 systems at their disposal. They are the most likely to face increasing bottlenecks with the current storage and file system rigs, but the least equipped to bring the expertise to uncork those problems.

Claffey admits that in the past, getting these “departmental” level users to take a shine to Lustre would have been a challenge, but he says that it’s mature, stable and has been thoroughly validated to work stably at a terabyte per second. He pointed to the recent successes of the file system’s ability to float on the flood of Blue Waters as proof, noting that this mid-market approach is the same system scaled down to fit into smaller budgets and talent pools. He notes that while in the past, smaller-scale simulation users might have been wary of Lustre’s appeal, current performance possibilities on the horizon are making it harder to ignore.

Again, it all boils down to a matter of priorities for these shops—a gigabyte per second would be fantastic, but at what cost if they were to just roll their own versus tear into a pre-packaged performance present with a Lustreous bow?

Xyratex is filing this market under a loose categorization of x86 boxes ranking in the 16 to 128 node range. This is a rather wide swath of users who, according to Claffey, have been pushing the limits of mainstream, simple NFS-based approaches on time-critical simulations. The problem is, the performance-enhanced alternative of using a parallel file system (Lustre, GPFS, etc) requires a host of integration, hardware purchase, and other steps on the RAID and metadata side, in addition to expertise and ongoing maintenance and management. This leads to a rather high TCO and a subsequent demand from users to deliver a pre-packaged set that just gets the job done without the piecemeal hacking and stacking.

As Claffey explained, at the midrange level, users face a major challenge when it comes to building their own storage systems, especially when they need to keep up with performance possibilities in the face of actual time-to-market demands. Their storage systems need to be scalable on the backend to deliver the kind of I/O performance that’s waiting in the wings for the right configuration. “Many of these users are just concerned with getting their problem solved—they don’t want a complex storage infrastructure and can’t hire PhDs to get them running. Further, they don’t have weeks or months to built it—they need something off the shelf that can be quickly integrated.”

“Architecturally, it’s easy to scale out a cluster on the compute side, but when users want to scale the performance of their applications, it’s not possible with NFS because one can’t add new nodes in a single name space. With Lustre, you can linearly scale by adding more storage nodes at the backend and thus you can scale x86-based storage capability so that you’re left with a balanced and optimized system.”

More specifically, instead of buying independent servers, HA RAID subsystems and then cobbling it together on the file system, operating system, data protection and other software fronts, users can look a tight 2U or 4U package for less hardware and software hassles. Again, not a new concept by any means—but it might signal bigger things for Lustre’s adoption in the wake of this growing subset of HPC users.

All of the mid-market push to bring Lustre to new groups overlaps with the roadmap Xyratex is driving along with OpenSFS, EOFS and other groups who are pushing adoption and expansion of the file system.

For the curious, here are some specs on the new offering—

Architecture that blends server, network and storage platforms, which used to have their own separate software layers into a single integrated, modular, scale-out storage building block. The goal is to open both performance and capacity while reducing administrative overhead.

The reported ability to scale performance from 1.25GB/s to 110GB/s and raw capacity from 42TB to 7.3PB.

Xyratex says this is about deployment in hours, not weeks, allowing users to be productive and realize the value from their investment immediately.

Support, including assistance with setup, installation and performance optimization.

ClusterStor Manager, which consolidates management of the entire storage cluster infrastructure, RAID data protection layer, operating system and Lustre into a single UI.

(CNN) - An angry outburst at a mosque. The posting of a suspicious YouTube video. A friendship with a shadowy imam.

Those were just some of the signs that Tamerlan Tsarnaev, accused of masterminding the Boston Marathon bombings, had adopted a virulent strain of Islam that led to the deaths of four people and injury of more than 260.

But how else can you tell that someone’s religious beliefs have crossed the line? The answer may not be as simple you think, according to scholars who study all brands of religious extremism. The line between good and evil religion is thin, they say, and it’s easy to make self-righteous assumptions.

“When it’s something we like, we say it’s commitment to an idea; when it’s something we don’t like, we say it’s blind obedience,” said Douglas Jacobsen, a theology professor at Messiah College in Pennsylvania.

Yet there are ways to tell that a person’s faith has drifted into fanaticism if you know what to look and listen for, say scholars who have studied some of history’s most horrific cases of religious violence.

“There are a lot of warning signs all around us, but we usually learn about them after a Jim Jones or a David Koresh,” said Charles Kimball, author of “When Religion Becomes Evil.”

Here are four warning signs:

1. I know the truth, and you don’t.

On the morning of July 29, 1994, the Rev. Paul Hill walked up to John Britton outside an abortion clinic in Pensacola, Florida, and shot the doctor to death. Hill was part of a Christian extremist group called the Army of God, which taught that abortion was legalized murder.

Hill’s actions were motivated by a claim that virtually all religions espouse: We have the truth that others lack.

Those claims can turn deadly when they become absolute and there is no room for interpretation, Kimball says.

“Absolute claims can quickly move into a justification of violence against someone who rejects that claim,” Kimball said. “It’s often a short step.”

Healthy religions acknowledge that sincere people can disagree about even basic truths, Kimball says.

The history of religion is filled with examples of truths that were once considered beyond questioning but are no longer accepted by all followers: inerrancy of sacred scripture, for example, or the subjugation of women and sanctioning of slavery.

If someone like Hall believes that they know God’s truth and they cannot be wrong, watch out, Kimball says.

“Authentic religious truth claims are never as inflexible as zealous adherents insist,” he writes in “When Religion Becomes Evil.”

Yet there’s a flip side to warnings about claiming absolute truth: Much of religion couldn’t exist without them, scholars say.

Many of history’s greatest religious figures – Moses, Jesus, the Prophet Mohammed – all believed that they had discovered some truth, scholars say.

Ordinary people inflamed with a sense of self-righteousness have made the same claim and done good throughout history, says Carl Raschke, a theology professor at the University of Denver in Colorado.

The Protestant Reformation was sparked by an angry German monk who thought he had the truth, Raschke says.

“Martin Luther’s disgust at the worldliness of the papacy in the early 1500s inspired him to become a radical revolutionary whose ideas overturned the entire political structure in Europe,” Raschke said.

So how do you tell the difference between the healthy claims of absolute truth and the deadly? Scholars say to look at the results: When people start hurting others in the name of their religious truth, they’ve crossed the line.

2. Beware the charismatic leader.

It was one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Japanese history. In March 1995, a religious sect called Aum Shinrikyo released a deadly nerve gas in a Tokyo subway station, leaving 12 people dead and 5,000 injured.

Two months later, Japanese police found Shoko Asahara, the sect’s founder, hiding in a room filled with cash and gold bars. Kimball, who tells the story of the sect in “When Religion Becomes Evil,” says Asahara had poisoned the minds of his followers years before.

Asahara demanded unquestioned devotion from members of his sect and isolated followers in communities where they were told that they no longer needed to think for themselves, Kimball says.

Any religion that limits the intellectual freedom of its followers, he says, has become dangerous. “When you start to get individuals who are the sole interpreters of truth, you get people who follow them blindly.""

Charismatic leaders, though, often don’t start off being cruel. Jim Jones, who led the mass suicide of his followers in South America, was a gifted speaker who built an interracial church in San Francisco that did much good in the community. Few people at the beginning of his ministry could predict what he would become.

As time went on, though, his charisma turned cruel as he tolerated no questions to his authority and became delusional.

“Charismatic leadership is important, but in healthy religions, there’s always a process where questions are encouraged,” Kimball said.

Weaning followers away from corrupt charismatic leaders and bad religion can take years, but it can be done if one knows how to speak their language, says Ed Husain, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.

Countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt will often deploy imams to reach out to young men in prison who have adopted “Islamism,” or extreme forms of Islam sanctioning violence against civilians, says Husain, who has written about Muslim extremism.

These Muslim clerics know the Quran better than the extremists and can use their knowledge to reach extremists in a place that logic and outsiders cannot penetrate, Husain said.

“The antidote to extremism is religion itself,” Husain said. “The problem is not to take Islam out of the debate but to use Islam to counter Islamism.”

3. The end is near.

In 1970, an unknown pastor from Texas wrote a book called “The Late, Great Planet Earth.” The book, which linked biblical prophecy with political events like Israel’s victory in the 1967 Six-Day War, predicted the imminent return of an antichrist and the end of the world.

Author Hal Lindsey’s book has sold an estimated 15 million copies and spawned a genre of books like the “Left Behind” series. Many people are fascinated by the idea that the heavens will open soon because the end is near.

That end-times theology can turn lethal, though, when a follower decides that he or she will speed up that end-time by conducting some dramatic or violent act, says John Alverson, chairman of the theology department at Carlow University in Pittsburgh.

“A religious terrorist mistakenly believes that God has ordained or called him or her to establish the will of God on Earth now, not gradually and not according to the slow and finicky free will of other humans,” Alverson said.

Yet this impulse to see God’s intervention in human affairs now and not in some distant future can also be good, he says.

There are vibrant religious communities that teach that political and economic injustice must be addressed now. Liberation theology, for example, was a movement among pastors and theologians in Latin America that called for justice for the poor now, not in some future apocalyptic event, Alverson says.

“Hope is a good breakfast but not much of a supper,” Alverson said. “We can’t just live on the hope that justice will happen; we have to actually experience justice from time to time so that our hope can continue.”

4. The end justifies the means.

It was one of the biggest scandals the Roman Catholic Church ever faced, and the repercussions are still being felt today.

In January 2002, the Boston Globe published a story about Father John Geoghan, a priest who had been moved around various parishes after Catholic leaders learned that he had abused children. It was later revealed that Catholic officials had quietly paid at least $10 million to settle lawsuits against Geoghan.

Kimball says the Catholic scandal revealed another sign that a faith has turned toxic: Religious figures start justifying doing something wrong for a higher good.

“The common theme was trying to protect the integrity of the church,” Kimball said of some Catholic leaders who covered up the crimes. “You get all of these rationalizations that we can’t let this scandal bring the whole church down, so we have to pay off this family and send the priests off to rehab.”

Religion is supposed to be a force for good. Still, it’s common that everyone from suicide bombers to venal church figures finds ways to justify their behavior in the name of some higher good.

Those rationalizations are so pervasive that religious movements that avoid them stand out, scholars say.

Jacobsen, the theology professor from Messiah College, cited the civil rights movement. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and his fellow activists renounced violence, even as they were attacked and sometimes murdered.

“They were willing to lay down their lives for what they believed in, but what’s incredible is, they practiced not retaliating when they suffered violence,” he said. “Those people really believed that God created everyone equal, and they were committed to the point of death.”

In some ways, it’s easy to say we would never adopt a form of religion that’s evil. But when we use the word “evil” to describe those who kill in the name of their faith, we’re already mimicking what we condemn, Jacobsen says.

In his new book, “No Longer Invisible: Religion in University Education,” Jacobson writes that calling a religion evil is dangerous because “bad or wrong actions can be corrected, but typically evil needs to be destroyed.”

CNN’s Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories

“To label someone or something as evil is to demonize it, putting it in a category of otherness where the rules of normal life do not apply, where the end often justifies almost any means,” Jacobson writes.

And when we do that, we don’t have to read about radical imams or look at angry YouTube videos to see how easy it is for someone to drift toward religious extremism, he says.

We need only look at ourselves.","Sun, 28 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/130426152558-waco-story-top.jpeg,"['beliefs', 'scholars', 'religious', 'religion', 'evil', 'good', 'signs', 'say', 'followers', 'kimball', 'theology', 'truth']", 
93,93,FL-2013-000054-CHN,Windows Azure brings Genetec video surveillance to the cloud - Cloud Pro,https://www.cloudpro.co.uk/saas/5550/windows-azure-brings-genetec-video-surveillance-cloud,"Video surveillance software specialist Genetec has partnered with Windows Azure and camera manufacturer Axis Communications to provide cloud-based visual security systems to SMBs.

Dubbed Stratocast, the offering lets users install a video surveillance system without investing in infrastructure to hold the recordings, as all or parts of the video stream can be stored in the Windows Azure cloud.

Depending on the level of service chosen, recordings can be saved in the cloud for anywhere between 14 and 90 days as part of a standard SLA.

For no extra cost, users can save certain parts of recordings - such as footage of an accident, crime or other incident - indefinitely in its Vault service, which is also hosted on Azure.

The benefit of using the cloud is two-fold, Genetec claims. First, it turns this type of visual security from a capital expenditure to an operational one, which can then be reclaimed from customers.

Secondly, if a company is broken into or their place of business is damaged by fire or flood the visual data of who or what perpetrated the incident will not be damaged, destroyed or removed.

The move to provide a video security product targeted primarily at SMBs marks a sea change for Genetec, which has previously only worked at enterprise scale.

Speaking at the product's launch, Andrew Elvish, Genetec’s vice president of marketing and communications, said: “To say that Genetec is out of our comfort zone with Stratocast would be a vast understatement.

“[Traditionally] we do not deal with small installations, we deal with large, globally diverse installations of video management systems. We can have over 100,000 cameras on one job of a single client.”

Elvish said the company challenged itself to think differently about video surveillance and look for a market underserved by the software delivering the video feed.

“We felt that SMBs were under serviced in terms of strong video management solutions that would bring together the robustness of a Genetec solution with the ease of a more consumer-style product. [We also] wanted to be sure it was low cost and subscription-based so [they] could use as much or as little as they need to,” said Elvish.

This led the organisation to develop Stratocast, which offers high scalability for a lower camera count.

As well as being suitable for SMBs, the product is also useful, Elvish claimed, for small municipalities or departments within municipalities that do not have a large surveillance camera network, or who need an increased number for occasions such as outdoor concerts, sporting events, such as the Olympics, or political events like the G8 or G20.

It can also be used by primary schools or teaching facilities that are away from the main part of a university or college campus, he added.

Elvish said Genetec chose to use Windows Azure over other infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offerings for “pragmatic” reasons.

“There were several reasons...but it is just easier and cheaper to [use Microsoft],"" he said.

“We did not want to go through a whole new learning curve with our developers, forcing them to learn a whole new system, especially given how pressing the release timeframe (of one year) was,” Elvish said, adding Genetec had worked with Microsoft very closely throughout the development of the new service.

Stratocast is currently in its launch phase, Elvish said. Anyone interested in the service can register their details on the Stratocast website and they will be contacted by one of the 100 service integrators the company has brought on board to deliver the offering to consumers.","Thu, 02 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn1.cloudpro.co.uk/sites/cloudprod7/files/CCTV%20Cloud.jpg,"['video', 'visual', 'surveillance', 'azure', 'genetec', 'smbs', 'service', 'stratocast', 'windows', 'security', 'cloud', 'elvish', 'brings']",

More than 500 strong, celebrants helped raise $625,000 for the cultural center while showcasing Houston's richly diverse population.

Dr. Devinder Bhatia, who parents are Sikhs and of Indian origin, and Gina Bhatia, all-American blonde, chaired the gala that celebrated the meshing of cultures from China to Iran to Pakistan. Consider the honorary chairs in this melting pot of ethnicities — Muffet Blake, Sheida and Dr. Mohammad Etminan and Sheela and Ashok Rao.

Guests from numerous nationalities, many in national dress, arrived via red carpet to spend the cocktail hour in an open-sided pavilion tent on the festival lawn of the sleek center.

Divya Brown in Indian attire, Y. Ping Sun in a stunning gown from China, Jo Furr in all-American black-tie gown and University of Houston president Renu Kahtor in dazzling Indian sari from her homeland were just a few setting the international fashion pace. Asia Society benefactor Nancy Allen and daughter-in-law Chinhui Juhn both wore traditional Korean formal dress while Asia Society acting director John Bradshaw Jr. dressed in an authentic, lightly beaded silk sherwani.

The show-stopper of the night was Duyen Huynh in black slim-cut evening gown and Piers Atkinson gargantuan cherries. All eyes were on the towering beauty from the moment of her arrival.

On this beautiful night, the center proved its mettle as a stellar entertaining space with colorfully-decorated dinner tables spread out across all venues in the contemporary space, from the stage of the theater to water garden terrace to the intimate north gallery. In the various venues Asian musicians provided dinner music while the Jackson and Co. team served a divine five-course meal.

The guest list was a who's who of the city's international community including Anne and Albert Chao, Lilly and Hamid Kooros, Nananko and Dale Tingleaf, Neda and Mosoud Ladjevardian, Dorothee Sauter Helfenstein and Josef Helfenstein, Sultana Mangalji, Kalyani Giri, Rathana Kumar, Miya Shay and Gene Wu and Eduardo and Pilar de la Garza.

The stellar turnout included Charles Foster, Tony and Isaac Arnold, Isla and Tommy Reckling, Bill King, Jennifer Roosth and Dominic Cellitti, C.C Conner and David Groover, Kathy and Marty Goossen, Tatiana and Craig Massey and Andrea and Bill White.","Sun, 28 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://houston.culturemap.com/favicon.ico,"['celebrated', 'space', 'gown', 'tiger', 'presence', 'night', 'stunning', 'center', 'houstons', 'indian', 'ball', 'asia', 'stellar', 'society', 'texas', 'venues', 'international']",

There are yellow streaks on my hair, splattered by an overwhelmed face painter outside the stadium. It isn’t easy being a non-CSK fan in Chepauk and neither is it easy weaving my way through a flood of passionate spectators making their way into the stadium. Then there are the hawkers waving all things yellow — jerseys, caps, vuvuzelas, wigs and those harmless but intimidating-looking groups of sozzled men reeking of alcohol and slurring as they shout “Naanga than win panna porom da,” to a few young boys in Hyderabad Sun Risers jerseys. And yet I make it well in time for the toss. My colleague Udhav is already at the gate. We excitedly chatter our way to the entrance only to be stopped by the guards. “No bags allowed,” they say. A little girl in the queue hugs on to her inflatable zoozoo doll tightly and tugging onto her father’s shirt says, “Appa don’t let them take my doll away.” After we resist they allow the ‘ladies handbag’ but the ‘gents handbag’ has to be gotten rid of. So as Udhav runs around trying to get rid of his bag, I pass in through the many security checks next to which lie mounds of food packets, water bottles, pens, lipsticks… By the time I reach my designated stand Sun Risers Hyderabad is four wickets down and I am probably sweating as much as the harried players on the field. Shortly, the colleague joins me, this time with a CSK flag which he sways animatedly. It’s never really easy when fans of two opposing teams have to write a story together…but we try and luckily so far there’s no love lost.

***

The players are not the only people who are making money because of the IPL. The hawkers, face painters, auto drivers and petty shop owners also find their business booming on match days. As I reach Gate No. 3, I have this young woman, Rani, waving the local team’s flag right in front of my face. She manages to make me buy her yellow flag after guilt tripping me about how I am not being a true fan. But, I successfully resist her offer to paint CSK on my cheeks. What does IPL mean to her? “On match days, my earnings definitely see a spike,” she says. As the cops shoo her away, I ask about the things that make her unhappy, “Apart from the rude cops, it would be great if people who spend thousands to get inside the stadium don’t bargain with me when they buy a flag for 50 rupees.”

Contrary to what the cricket purists would want us to believe, the shorter, snappier and, arguably, the more entertaining version of the gentlemen’s game is here to stay. People across age groups, time and again are thrilled by the IPL be it the five-year old showing off his dappankoothu moves every time CSK hits a boundary or the 70-year-old couple in yellow (with the lady even wearing two yellow roses on her hair) who nervously prayed every time the team hit an airborne shot. Someone who has developed a fanatical liking to cricket after the success of the IPL is Sai Lakshmi, mother of a third year chemical engineering student, who has managed to go for all the matches in Chennai. What brings her to the stadium day in day out? “It is my love for Chennai, Dhoni and the entertainment that I get from these games,” she says. How does she manage to get tickets? “Most of the time, I buy. But sometimes, ask friends.”

Her son, a football fan, admits to having watched every game of the 2012 edition. He claims to have watched the full match the previous night and then switched over to the Champions League football match that went on till 3 in the morning. How does he manage to wake up and board the college bus at 6 a.m.? “I do it all the time,” he winks.

It’s probably well past their bed time, but there are still quite a number of children present in the stadium. Some of them have school the next day. Twelve-year-old Athreya, seems to have sorted out his schedule for the next morning. Even though his mother insists he could take a day off he is keen on going to school probably to tell his friends that he was at the stadium watching a clincher of a match. A Sachin Tendulkar fan, he is supporting Chennai because he says he belongs to this city and loves it.

Three night matches in a row has been quite the bonanza for Chennaiites and it’s never an easy task to be present on all days but 11-year-old Mansi has being doing so even if it means taking the train from Tiruvanmiyur every time.

There’s confetti in the air and shrill shouts of joy as CSK win the match. Many spectators watch the last over standing near the exit. “I have to quickly rush and get an auto because I have to go to Perambur,” says one of them. The others make a beeline for the MRTS. As the auto drivers outside the stadium see the elated supporters of the home team coming out whistling and cheering, they also seem delighted. A 10-minute ride to the Chintadripet station costs a whopping 200 bucks. For those staying further it gets worse. But constant conversations about the exciting moments during the match keep the fans upbeat.","Fri, 26 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article12174971.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27MP_GANESAN1,"['stadium', 'chepauk', 'match', 'yellow', 'ipl', 'flag', 'day', 'csk', 'whistle', 'way', 'fan', 'podu', 'easy']", 
96,96,FL-2013-000054-CHN,"Marks & Spencer's Shwopping, One Year Later: Progress and Potential - Triple Pundit",https://www.triplepundit.com/story/2013/marks-spencers-shwopping-one-year-later-progress-and-potential/51886,"A year has already passed since Marks & Spencer launched its Shwopping campaign in many of its United Kingdom stores. In partnership with the NGO Oxfam, Shwopping has helped move textile and garment recycling a huge step forward. The premise of the Shwopping initiative is customers can drop unwanted clothing into a specially labeled box when they shop for new garments--even if the clothing was not purchased at M&S. With beloved actress Joanna Lumley as Shwopping’s spokeswoman, the program launched in April 2012 with gusto.

So how has the program fared one year later? Yesterday morning I chatted over the phone with Adam Elman from his London office. As Marks & Spencer’s Head of Delivery for Plan A, the company’s sustainability and ethical agenda, Elman updated me on Shwopping’s successes and challenges.

Customers want to be ‘green’ but say, ‘Don’t preach at me; so help me to live more sustainably and make it easier for me’ - Adam Elman, Marks & Spencer

To recap how Shwopping works: customers can drop off unwanted garments at an M&S store in a “Shwop Drop Box” (only Ms. Lumley can elegantly articulate that term). In return, customers can enter drawings for prizes, and today, in fact, those who walk into an M&S store and “Shwop” receive a £5 voucher redeemable at the stores.

M&S delivers the garments to Oxfam, where they are sorted. Some are sold in charity shops in the UK; cold weather clothes end up in Eastern Europe while garments suitable for warmer climates end up in Africa. Clothing in poor condition is recycled into mattress bedding, carpet inlay or even into dishy winter coats sold in M&S stores and online. Each eco-fashion coat boasts a QR code that the owner can scan and understand the origins of the fibers within that coat.

As a last resort, some end up incinerated in waste-to-energy plants; none of the garments ends up in landfill.

The goal of M&S is to engender a “one-to-one shopping culture” in which consumers will eventually “shwop” a used garment for a new one. Widespread garment recycling, however, has a long road ahead.

Textile recycling has longed slumped behind the reuse and reprocessing of other goods. The numbers are daunting: globally 500,000 tons of textiles, or about 1 billion garments, are sent to landfill annually. Crunch the numbers and 114,000 clothing items hourly end up in municipal waste streams. The cycle only worsens year to year: in the UK alone, approximately 350 million new garments are sold annually.

“It’s a journey,” Elman said, “mass consumer change is not going to happen overnight.” But Shwopping has already made progress. So far almost 4 million garments have been “shwopped,” with the result that 1,300 tons of clothing have not ended up in landfill. The program has generated $3.7 million dollars for Oxfam and the programs the NGO funds worldwide.

M&S is also experimenting with procuring unwanted clothes: the company has a pilot “Shwop at Work” program in which companies can place Shwop Drops within their offices and employees receive a voucher in return for the clothes they drop off. “There is a lot we could do to make it better,” Elman said, and he listed some ideas such as Shwop Drop boxes at M&S food stores and picking up clothes when furniture is delivered. Everything is a learning process, from the location of the boxes, pick up of those boxes, and even gauging feedback from customers and employees.

Earlier this year, H&M launched a global garment recycling program. I asked Elman whether M&S would do the same. Currently M&S has pilot programs in Greece and the United Arab Emirates, but for now the focus is on the UK. Part of the challenge is the environmental trade off: in smaller markets the carbon emissions and fuel consumption would more than offset the benefits of recycling those clothes. Then there is the cultural aspect: India, for example, has many M&S stores but a culture of reuse already exists.

In Senegal, Shwopping has begun to bear fruit. Many of the recycled clothes end up in Senegal because Oxfam has long run programs in this country of almost 13 million. The focal point is Frip Ethique, Oxfam’s secondhand clothing distribution center in the business district of Dakar, Senegal’s capital. Almost 50 people, who are paid far more than the average local wage, sort through the clothes and sell them to wholesalers who in turn sell them throughout Senegal. According to Sally Williams of The Telegraph, last year the operation netted over $330,000 in profits, which Oxfam then uses to fund various programs including a rice-growing project in the northern part of the country and another assisting residents in a flood-prone slum area of Dakar.

As we wrapped up our chat, I asked Elman what he thought of other recycling programs such as the aforementioned H&M scheme. His response: “If it continues to other stores, we will be really proud . . . extremely proud.”

So while there is a long road until Shwopping truly scales, the foundation has been set. American retailers, are you listening?

98,98,FL-2013-000054-CHN,"Small Hydro, Big Opportunity - POWER magazine - POWER magazine",https://www.powermag.com/small-hydro-big-opportunity/,"Small-scale hydro generation stands to benefit from recent congressional action aimed at streamlining what historically has been a challenging federal approvals process. That action, along with technology innovations, could make it easier to develop hydro generating capacity in sources as diverse as navigable rivers, man-made conduits, and water distribution systems.



For the U.S. House of Representatives to agree on anything these days is unusual. For it to agree unanimously on a bill related to renewable energy may strike some as just short of a miracle. But in mid-February, House members voted 422-0 to approve H.R. 267, a piece of legislation aimed at streamlining regulations for small hydropower projects that tap some of the potential generating capacity available in the U.S.

Following passage, the bill moved to the Senate, which is expected to consider it later this year. If passed and signed into law, the bill would promote the development of small-scale hydropower and so-called conduit generation projects, which are powered by the force of water flowing in structures such as irrigation canals and water distribution pipes. It also aims to shorten regulatory timeframes for other low-impact hydropower projects, such as adding power generation to existing nonpowered dams and developing closed-loop pumped storage, which can help to balance intermittent renewable resources such as wind and solar. Under the current license approval regime, project developers have to wait years for approval. Such regulatory lag can be deadly to smaller-scale projects.

“There’s incredible potential right now,” said Cherise M. Oram, a partner in the Stoel Rives law firm and vice president of the National Hydropower Association (NHA). “The industry believes there have got to be ways to meet existing regulatory standards without taking so long, especially for small projects.”

The trade group’s view is that developers should more easily be able to add power generating equipment at existing dam structures when no incremental environmental impact is expected, said Jeffrey A. Leahy, NHA’s director of government affairs. “There are no tremendous additional environmental impacts, so why go through the same environmental process” as new construction, he asked.

Small is beautiful as the industry focuses attention on developing what could be up to 12 GW of hydro generating capacity across the U.S.—provided regulatory reform that has been recognized as needed for years becomes a reality.

The current licensing process for a project 50 MW or smaller can be daunting. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) exercises licensing authority, but the path to federal licensing involves a lengthy application process that may include environmental impact assessments, endangered species and water quality evaluations, and lengthy consultations with state agencies and tribal organizations, with no single decision-maker in the process.

Once a FERC license is obtained, the developer of a project at an existing federal lock or dam must repeat the application process to win approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or the Bureau of Reclamation, two federal entities whose jurisdiction extends to water resources that include locks, dams, navigable waterways, and related infrastructure. Power generation historically has fallen low on their list of priorities, superseded by uses such as commercial navigation, flood control, and recreation. By the time a hydropower application wins approval from one of these entities, the initial FERC license requirement for the start of construction may have expired.

The net effect has been to dampen small hydro generation development and drive up its cost. And it’s precisely among small-scale developments that much of the potential exists to expand hydroelectric generation in the U.S.

Before there were large-scale wind farms and thin-film rooftop solar, there was hydro. Indeed, the first engines of the Industrial Revolution were driven by water power, a use that today might be labeled “distributed generation.” The ancient Greeks made use of “Archimedes’ screw,” a machine historically used for transferring water from a low-lying body of water into irrigation ditches that is being reexamined as a potentially modern power generation source.

In the U.S., 100,000 MW of installed capacity accounts for about two-thirds of the nation’s renewable electricity and 6.5% of total generation. Hydropower enjoys even more widespread deployment outside of the U.S. Top producers, according to the International Energy Agency, are led by Norway, with hydro providing nearly 98% of generation, and Brazil, where it provides roughly 78%. And although China only provides 17% of its total generation from hydro, its 22,500-MW Three Gorges Dam is the world’s largest hydroelectric facility. Large impoundment reservoirs such as Brazil’s Itaipú and China’s Three Gorges garner a lot of headlines, but the majority of hydroelectric capacity is much smaller in scale.

In the U.S., at least, much of the focus on new hydro capacity is tied to water supplies that include existing reservoirs and man-made conduits, said Rick Miller, senior vice president of renewable energy services at HDR Inc. Many small-scale hydro power projects can connect directly to the local power distribution network, eliminating the need for significant transmission capacity. “The small stuff is very much a distributed generation technology similar to distributed solar,” he said.

Assess the Costs

A June 2012 report by the International Renewable Energy Agency, an organization comprising 158 member states plus the European Union, said that average investment costs for large hydropower plants with storage typically range from as low as $1,050/kW to as high as $7,650/kW, while the range for small hydropower projects is between $1,300/kW and $8,000/kW. Adding additional capacity at existing hydropower schemes or existing dams that don’t have a hydropower plant can be significantly cheaper and can cost as little as $500/kW.

The report considered annual operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and said these are often quoted as a percentage of the investment cost per kilowatt. Typical values range from 1% to 4%. Large hydropower projects typically have O&M costs averaging around 2% to 2.5%. Small hydropower projects lack scale economies and can have O&M costs of between 1% and 6%, or higher.

The cost of electricity generated by hydropower is generally low, although costs are site-specific. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for hydropower refurbishments and upgrades ranges from as low as $0.01/kWh for additional capacity at an existing hydropower project to around $0.05/kWh for a more expensive upgrade project, assuming a 10% cost of capital. The LCOE for large hydropower projects typically ranges from $0.02 to $0.19/kWh, assuming a 10% cost of capital. The report said this makes the best hydropower projects among the most cost-competitive generating options available today. The LCOE range for small hydropower projects for a number of projects in developing countries was between $0.02 and $0.10/kWh, making small hydro a frequently cost-competitive option to supply electricity to the grid or to supply off-grid rural electrification schemes. Very small hydropower projects, however, can have higher costs and an LCOE of $0.27/kWh or more for so-called “pico-hydro” systems.

Many Turbine Options

The most suitable and efficient turbine for a hydropower project depends on the site and the overall power scheme design, with key considerations being the head and flow rate (see the sidebar for definitions).

Common Hydroelectric Terms Cavitation: Rapid changes in pressure result in the formation of bubbles that then collapse when the water passes into higher-pressure regions of a turbine. Repeated cavitation can damage turbine blades.

Flow: The volume of water passing a point in a given period of time.

Head: Vertical change in elevation between the head water level and the tailwater level.

Headwater: The water level above the center line of the turbine.

Low head: A head of 66 feet or less.

Penstock: A closed and pressurized conduit or pipe for conducting water to the powerhouse.

Runner: The rotating part of the turbine that converts the energy of falling water into mechanical energy.

Tailrace: The channel that carries water away from a dam.

Tailwater: The water downstream of the powerhouse.

Ultra-low head: A head of 10 feet or less.

One type of turbine, known as a Francis turbine, is a reaction turbine that ranks among the most widely used hydropower turbines worldwide. Using guide vanes and wicket gates to control the water’s flow and direction on the turbine blades, Francis turbines are highly efficient and can be used for a wide range of heads and flow rates.

The Kaplan turbine was derived from the Francis turbine and allows efficient hydropower production at heads that are between 33 feet and 230 feet, typically much lower than for a Francis turbine.

Impulse turbines such as Pelton, Turgo, and cross-flow (sometimes referred to as Banki-Michell or Ossberger) designs are also in widespread use. These turbines are driven purely on the impulse of flowing water. Among impulse turbines, the Pelton turbine is most commonly used with high heads and utilizes nozzles to control the water’s flow to the runner buckets—much like a high-pressure nozzle at the end of a hose.

“Equipment innovations in the last 15 years have made it possible to use sites that were not viable because of low-head conditions,” said James Borg, group leader of Small Hydro Projects for MWH Global. Key innovations include low-rpm turbines using permanent magnet generators, fish-friendly technology, and advanced power-converting electronics. Another factor is the supply of economically competitive equipment from Asia, he said.

Hydropower plants can be built in a variety of sizes and with different characteristics. In addition to the importance of head and flow rate, hydropower schemes can fall into one of several categories:

Run-of-river hydropower projects have no, or very little, storage capacity behind the dam, with generation dependent on the size of river flows.

Reservoir (storage) hydropower schemes store water behind a dam and so decouple generation from water inflows. Reservoir capacities can be small or large, depending on site characteristics and the economics of dam construction.

Pumped storage schemes use electricity at off-peak times (often overnight) to pump water from a reservoir located after the tailrace to the top of a reservoir, thus enabling the pumped storage plant to generate electricity at peak times. Fast-reaction pumped storage facilities are being constructed to provide the grid stability needed to address the intermittent influx of energy from wind generation.

Assess the Resource

The industry has said for years, based upon the Corps of Engineers’ National Inventory of Dams database, that only around 3% of the nation’s 80,000 or so dams have electricity generation associated with them. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) published in April 2012 a study of hydropower potential in the U.S. It found that many of the monetary costs and environmental impacts of dam construction have already been incurred at these non-powered dams (NPDs), so adding power to the existing structure often can be achieved at lower cost, with less risk, and within a shorter timeframe than through new dam construction. The abundance, cost, and environmental benefits of NPDs, combined with the reliability and predictability of hydropower, make these dams a potentially attractive way to expand the nation’s renewable energy supply.

Of the more than 80,000 NPDs throughout the U.S., 54,391 dams were analyzed by ORNL, with the remainder eliminated from consideration due to faulty geographic information or erroneous flow or drainage area attributes. ORNL said that adding power generation to U.S. NPDs has the potential to contribute up to 12 GW of new renewable capacity—a potential that it said is equal to increasing the size of the existing conventional hydropower fleet by 15%. Most of this potential lies in just 100 NPDs, which could contribute some 8 GW of hydropower; ORNL said the top 10 facilities alone could add up to 3 GW of new hydropower.

The ORNL study also found that 81 of the 100 top NPDs are U.S. Army Corps of Engineers facilities, many of which, including all of the top 10, are navigation locks on the Ohio, Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas Rivers, and their major tributaries. The study also suggested that dams owned by the Bureau of Reclamation hold the potential to add another 260 MW of capacity.

Three different small-scale hydropower ventures illustrate the range of projects and technologies that could be deployed across the U.S. One is a series of hydropower installations at Corps of Engineers navigation dams. The second is a repowering of a powerhouse in the Rocky Mountains with a high head. The third represents two new technologies that could expand the distributed nature of small-scale power in water supply systems.

Power from the Ohio River

American Municipal Power-Ohio (AMP) is building five new hydroelectric projects on Corps of Engineers dams along the Ohio River. Altogether, the projects will add more than 350 MW of hydro generation to the region. Voith Hydro is manufacturing the turbines and generators for the first four projects, which include run-of-river generating facilities. Nearly 80 AMP member communities are participating in the projects, all of which consist of an intake approach channel, a reinforced concrete powerhouse, and a tailrace channel.

These projects are among the first to be developed on Corps structures in decades, and AMP had to be patient and persistent to win both a FERC license and Corps approval. The process was “a bit painful” but opened the Corps’ eyes to how the approval process might be streamlined, said Paul Blaszczyk, a vice president and the project manager for MWH, the consulting firm serving as AMP’s engineer for all of the projects. As a nonprofit, AMP was able to secure good interest rates for the projects. What’s more, it considers the projects to be 100-year investments, a point of view that helped improve the projects’ economics and keep the lengthy approval process in perspective.

AMP’s Cannelton Project will divert water from the existing Corps Cannelton Locks and Dam through bulb turbines to generate an average gross annual output of roughly 458 GWh. The “bulb” designation comes from the shape of the upstream watertight casing, which contains a generator located on the horizontal axis. The powerhouse will house three horizontal 29.3-MW turbine and generating units with an estimated total rated capacity of 88 MW at a gross head of 25 feet. A 1,000-foot-long, 138-kV transmission line interconnection is planned to connect to the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (MISO).

The Smithland Project will divert water from the Smithland Locks and Dam through bulb turbines to generate an average gross annual output of some 379 GWh. The powerhouse will house three horizontal 25.3-MW turbine and generating units with an estimated total rated capacity of 76 MW at a gross head of 22 feet. A 2-mile-long, 161-kV transmission line interconnection is planned to connect to MISO.

The Willow Island Project will divert water from the Willow Island Locks and Dam through bulb turbines to generate an average of 239 GWh annually. The powerhouse will house two horizontal 22-MW turbine and generating units with an estimated total rated capacity of 44 MW at a gross head of 20 feet. A 1.6-mile-long, 138-kV transmission line interconnection is planned to connect to PJM.

The Meldahl/Greenup projects include the run-of-river hydroelectric generating facility currently under construction at the Captain Anthony Meldahl Dam on the Ohio River and the existing generating facility at the Greenup Dam, also on the Ohio River. More than four dozen AMP member communities are participating in this project. Under a partnership agreement with the member community of Hamilton, Ohio, AMP is overseeing construction of the Meldahl project and will own 48.6% of the facility when it becomes operational. Upon commercial operation of the Meldahl project, AMP will obtain a 48.6% share of the Greenup facility.

The Meldahl Project will divert water from the existing Corps Meldahl Locks and Dam through bulb turbines to generate an average gross annual output of approximately 558 GWh. The powerhouse will house three horizontal 35-MW turbine and generating units with a FERC-licensed rated capacity of 105 MW at a gross head of 30 feet. If interconnected to MISO, an 8-mile-long, 138-kV transmission line is planned. If interconnected to PJM, a 5-mile-long, 345-kV transmission line is planned.

Rocky Mountain Hydro

The Boulder Canyon Hydroelectric Project (BCH) was built in 1910 by the Eastern Colorado Power Co. to generate electricity. During the 1950s, the facilities also began providing water for the City of Boulder’s municipal water supply. Boulder bought the BCH from Public Service Co. of Colorado (Xcel Energy) in 2001. At that time, there were two 63-year-old, 10-MW turbine/generators in the power plant, only one of which was operational. Boulder determined that a new 5-MW turbine/generator, shown in Figure 1, would be needed to keep the facility in operation. The smaller unit would be more appropriately sized for the plant and would extend the life of the hydroelectric project for at least 50 years. In addition, even though smaller, the new turbine/generator would be able to produce 30% more energy because it is more efficient.

The generator is to the right in a red housing. The new equipment is smaller but more efficient than the retired 10-MW unit, which can be seen in the background on the left. Source: POWER

In 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy provided a grant opportunity for projects such as the BCH modernization project as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Boulder received $1.2 million toward a total estimated project cost of $5.2 million.

The project scope included removing one of the two existing 10-MW turbines, installing a new 5-MW turbine/generator, upgrading wiring, installing a state-of-the-art turbine isolation valve, installing remote monitoring and operation equipment, and removing and replacing several aging, oil-cooled transformers adjacent to Boulder Creek.

A pressure line drops water more than 1,800 feet from a forebay to the powerhouse and delivers its water under a static head of 800 pounds per square inch. Because the water is used as part of Boulder’s drinking water supply, almost all the pressure needs to be removed from the flow before it can be distributed throughout the city. Before the hydro facility was built, a pressure-relief valve accomplished this function. Now the powerhouse can handle this function, provided water supplies are adequate.

Because the water is not used solely for power generation, complex water management issues come into play, said Jake Gesner, hydroelectric manager, pictured in Figure 2. For example, environmental considerations require that the adjacent Boulder Creek have a minimum water flow equal to 4 cubic feet per second. During periods of drought—such as in 2002 as well as early this year—no water is available for power generation as water managers conserve resources in the city’s 64-square-mile mountaintop watershed.

2. Inside a Pelton turbine. Using a spare 5-MW Pelton turbine that was supplied by Canyon Hydro for the Boulder Canyon Hydroelectric Project, Jake Gesner, hydroelectric manager, explains how one or more needle valves direct water onto clamshell-shaped buckets on the turbine runner. All of the available head is thus converted into kinetic energy that turns the runner and drives the generator shaft. Source: POWER

Irrigation and Other Supply Sources

Still smaller technologies are being developed for use in low-head, high-flow situations that exist in settings as diverse as irrigation canals and drinking water distribution pipes.

For example, Alameda, Calif.–based Natel Energy developed a fully flooded, two-stage impulse turbine, called the Schneider Linear hydroEngine or SLH, that resembles a series of airplane wings on a conveyor belt (Figure 3). The turbine’s innovation is that it is optimized around flow, not pressure, said Gia Schneider, chairman and CEO. Water conveyed through a pipe or penstock enters the SLH and encounters a cascade of fixed foils, called guide vanes. These guide vanes direct flow into the first cascade of moving blades. After passing over the moving blades, the water flows through a second cascade of guide vanes and then passes through a second cascade of blades moving in the opposite direction. The guide vanes are adjustable in pitch, allowing for direct control of flow rate, thus keeping the machine’s efficiency high across a range of flows.

The company has a 50-kW, 4-foot-tall unit on the market, as well as a 0.5-MW, 8-foot-tall unit. Development is under way on a unit with a capacity between 1 and 10 MW that is expected to be available in 2015. In 2009, the company installed a small unit on a canal owned by the Buckeye Water Conservation and Drainage District in Arizona. That project had 6 feet of head, produced 8 kW, and is grid connected. The generating system’s general design is shown in Figure 4.

A second small-scale technology was developed by Lucent Energy for use inside water distribution pipes. It uses a vertical-axis turbine similar to a wind turbine with the shaft perpendicular to the water flow. The turbine’s design ensures that downstream pressures are maintained. The turbine allows the water to go through it, but at the same time, because of the geometry of the blades, it’s able to turn and lift like an airplane wing and turn a generator. A prototype 20-kW system was installed in early 2012 in a water distribution pipe in Riverside, Calif. A second, four-unit, 200-kW system is being installed in a 42-inch-diameter water pipe in Portland, Ore.

“The shaft can go through the pipe wall without being exposed to water in the pipe,” said Josh Thomas, engineering program manager. The components are all certified for use in drinking water supplies, but Lucent is mindful of water quality issues such as sediment and alkalinity that can adversely affect its equipment.

Two years ago during the economic slowdown and collapse of the price of natural gas in the U.S., Hydro Green Energy, a small-scale hydropower developer, turned its focus toward Latin America, in particular Chile, Colombia, and Panama. Efforts are under way in those markets to shift from fossil fuels for generation to renewable resources such as hydro, said Michael P. Maley, president and CEO. In the U.S., the company has more than two dozen preliminary licenses to install up to 340 MW of generating capacity in 13 states. But the company views the licensing and approval process as inefficient and slow, with little urgency on the part of the Corps of Engineers or the Bureau of Reclamation to evaluate small-scale projects and coordinate efforts with FERC.

In the case of Hydro Green Energy, the focus is on modular design using off-the-shelf equipment that can be readily installed at an existing structure. Both the turbine and the generator are in frames that can be easily removed for maintenance and are designed to run for 75 years, said Maley.

Ready for a Renaissance

To better enable Hydro Green Energy’s installation of technology with a 75-year lifespan, the NHA and its member companies have to get the Senate to approve the small-hydro bill that won unanimous House support in February. Once that happens, the NHA’s Jeff Leahy said a “renaissance” in U.S. hydro development could take place. That’s something of a loaded term in the power generation industry, which heard promises in recent years of a nuclear renaissance that failed to materialize. But hydro’s fortunes may be different, buoyed by comparatively simple technology, readily adaptable existing infrastructure, and an abundant and renewable fuel source whose value as a tool has withstood the test of time. â–
