With annual rains expected to arrive in April and the threat of cyclones looming, Humanity & Inclusion staff in the camps are extremely concerned about the impact of flooding and landslides.

In August 2017, Rohingya refugees fled in masses from neighboring Myanmar and set up rudimentary shelters across a 3,000 acre area in the Cox’s Bazar region of Bangladesh. Kutupalong-Balukhali camp now hosts over 600,000 people and is the largest and most densely populated refugee settlement in the world.

“The threat posed by the upcoming rainy season is likely to worsen from April to August” explains Sophie Dechaux, HI Country Director in Bangladesh. “Almost all trees and shrubs have been cleared to make space for shelters and many have been built on steep hillsides. When the rains arrive, the ground will be unable to absorb the water so we are expecting significant flooding and multiple landslides”

The effects are likely to put even greater strain on already stretched humanitarian services. “Families will be forced to move into safer areas; they will need new shelters. Overcrowding and standing flood water will create ideal conditions for waterborne diseases.”

HI has been supporting the most vulnerable people in the camps since the beginning of the emergency in August 2017. The challenges of the coming months will disproportionately affect our beneficiaries. People with physical disabilities will not be able to move around the camp to access services due to floods and many may not be able to move quickly in the case of a landslide.

HI is working with local authorities and coordinating with other humanitarian organizations to prepare. Our priority is to ensure that vulnerable people are taken into account and will still have access to the support they need.","Fri, 30 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/report-images/hero_c_Philippa-Pousserau_HI__Bangladesh_refugee_camp_in_Dec_2017.png?itok=RlkeibE_,"['water', 'need', 'bangladesh', 'rains', 'brace', 'landslides', 'threat', 'shelters', 'camp', 'vulnerable', 'refugee', 'flooding', 'refugees', 'rohingya', 'services']", 
1,1,FL-2018-000105-BGD,Racing to avert a monsoon catastrophe in Bangladesh - UNHCR,https://www.unhcr.org/news/stories/2018/3/5aa9065f2d2/racing-avert-monsoon-catastrophe-bangladesh.html,"Their few belongings packed into rice sacks, Momena Begum and her husband Mohammad Harez squat on a damp plot of sand just above the waterline, waiting to move out.

Almost surrounded by a chest-deep stream, they know the coming wet season in Bangladesh could bring the deadly dangers they narrowly escaped in Myanmar.

“None of us can swim,” says Mohammad, a father of three. “If we are here in the monsoon, we will surely drown.”

With the rainy season a few weeks away, the Bangladeshi government, supported by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency and its partners, is in a race against time to avert a catastrophe threatening the world’s largest refugee settlement.

More than 670,000 Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh since August to escape killings, arson and rape in Myanmar’s Rakhine State, many settling spontaneously on the unsuitable hillsides around Kutupalong.

“None of us can swim. If we are here in the monsoon, we will surely drown.”

Monsoon rains reach a peak in July and August, dumping up to two inches of rain a day, and more than 150,000 residents of this mega-settlement are at risk from flooding or landslides.

“It is not if this is going to happen, it’s when,” says John Wain, until recently senior emergency shelter officer with UNHCR in Cox’s Bazar.

“The soils in that site are a combination of clay, silt and sand layers, and those soils will move. There will be landslides, there will be floods, there will be ravine floods, there will be flash floods.”

The risk of landslides has been aggravated by the felling of trees, and grubbing out of their roots, for fuel to cook.

The impending danger is keenly felt by refugee Mohammad Alam and his family, whose shelter stands beside a low-lying creek. It burst its banks one night as farmers released dam water to irrigate rice crops, flooding them out.

“We were up to our ankles in filthy water this morning,” says Alam, 40, a father of three children under four years old. “It’s not safe for us here.”

UNHCR has relocated the first of 360 families deemed at greatest risk, including those of Begum and Alam, to higher ground in the west of the settlement, in a project with its partner, the non-governmental agency, Caritas. More will be relocated by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

In an appeal launched earlier this month, UN agencies and their partners are seeking US$951 million to meet the urgent needs of Rohingya refugees and Bangladeshi host communities.

The Bangladeshi government, UNHCR and its partners are taking other urgent steps to better protect nearly 80,000 people deemed at greatest risk of flooding in the area, and 23,000 threatened by landslides.

""There will be landslides, there will be floods, there will be ravine floods, there will be flash floods.”

To reduce the danger of slope collapse in a new 123-acre site designated for relocated families, mechanical diggers are reducing the angle of some of the steepest hillsides at greatest risk of giving way. They are backfilling the valleys with soil to provide more stable ground for shelters.

Teams of paid refugee labourers and diggers are excavating and straightening clogged waterways in the camp. The goal is to allow flood water to flow unhindered into the Teknaf River and the sea, in a project with UN sister agencies IOM and the World Food Programme.

“It’s a priority activity,” says Wain. “If we don’t start now, we won’t have dry ground before the monsoon.”

Access roads into the settlements could also become blocked by landslides and inaccessible to vehicles, making it hard to provide emergency aid. To keep them open, the Bangladeshi government has said it will pave them with bricks.

Engineering projects are also under way to build bamboo-reinforced footpaths, raised bridges and sturdy retaining walls to stabilize hillsides, stripped of trees and even their roots in the daily hunt for firewood.

Contractors and refugees are using sandbags staked with bamboo to reinforce steps carved into steep hillsides, which turned into mudslides during the last wet season, as grandmother Siraj Begum discovered at great personal cost.

She lost her footing during a cloudburst and fell down the hillside from her shack into the fetid creek below, injuring her leg, which still troubles her today.

“I don’t know if we can live here through another monsoon,” she says in her home on a crumbling slope designated for levelling. “I’m worried the whole hillside might come down.”

UNHCR and its partners are this year providing 80,000 families in the camp with bamboo poles and tarpaulins to weatherproof flimsy shelters. Among the beneficiaries is father-of-seven Mohammad Ishaq, whose home clings to an exposed ridge.

Helped by neighbours, he has re-roofed it, woven sturdy bamboo walls and sealed the dirt floor with cement. “My only concern now is the wind,” he adds, casting a weather eye over the valley below.

Landslides could also sweep tube wells and latrines into creeks, in which residents wash clothes and children play, raising the threat of outbreaks of water-borne diarrhoea which last year made thousands ill.

Teams are digging boreholes to greater depths to draw cleaner water filtered through the sandy soil. Public health workers are prepositioning medicines to ensure effective treatments are available where they will be needed, although the challenges are daunting.

“We’ve managed outbreaks of diarrhoea before, but not when you are talking about nearly one million people.”

“We’ve managed outbreaks of diarrhoea before, but not when you are talking about nearly one million people,” says Mwiti Mungania, the senior public health officer with UNHCR in Cox’s Bazar, who previously worked with refugees in Chad. “If it happens, it could be a huge issue.”

Among families who have already been flooded out, health problems are already evident. As they wait to move out, Begum’s son Mohammad Anas suffered from a cough and vomiting. “It gets worse at night,” she says.

A neighbour, four-year-old Nurul Absar, has chills which his grandmother blames on contaminated water. “He has a fever now because of the water, and it could only get worse with the monsoon,” she says.

UNHCR is working with 230 refugee community outreach members, fanning out through the settlement to identify elderly and infirm refugees who are among the most vulnerable.

Ahead of the gathering storm, plans include identifying safe havens for any separated children and prepositioning food and medicines should those in need be cut off by the weather.

Other plans involve training refugees in first aid and advising people to put identity documents and other vital papers in plastic bags.

“We have been getting ready,” says refugee Azizur Rahman. “Now it’s in God’s hands.”","Thu, 29 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.unhcr.org/thumb3/5aafba343.jpg,"['monsoon', 'unhcr', 'bangladesh', 'refugee', 'shelter', 'settlement', 'mohammad', 'kutupalong', 'unhcrroger', 'avert', 'refugees', 'racing', 'catastrophe']", 
2,2,FL-2018-000105-BGD,Bangladesh Plans to Begin Moving Rohingya Refugees to Remote Island in June - Radio Free Asia (RFA),https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/island-04052018171219.html,"The voluntary relocation of about 100,000 Rohingya refugees from crowded camps in southeastern Bangladesh to a recently formed sedimentary island at the mouth of the Meghna River could start by June, government officials said Thursday.



The Bangladesh Navy has almost finished developing Bhashan Char, a low-lying and flood-prone island in southern Noakhali district in the Bay of Bengal. It is building shelters to accommodate refugees along with geographic features to protect them from cyclones and flooding, according to Bangladeshi officials.



“The construction and development work on Bhashan Char has been going on fast. We hope we can start relocating the Rohingya by June,” Habibul Kabir Chowdhury, chief of a Ministry of Disaster Management unit that handles Rohingya-related matters, told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.



Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina indicated Thursday that efforts to repatriate thousands of Rohingya refugees through a bilateral agreement struck with Myanmar late last year had made no real progress, her spokesman said.



The construction work on Bhashan Char is part of a 23.12 billion taka (U.S. $280 million) plan announced by the government in November to move them from refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar district, which borders Myanmar’s Rakhine state.



“The houses under construction on Bhashan Char will be much better in terms of facilities than the camps in Ukhia and Teknaf,” Chowdhury said, referring to the two sub-districts of Cox’s Bazar that have borne the brunt of the Rohingya refugee influx from Rakhine over the years. These include at least 670,000 Rohingya since August 2017, according to U.N. estimates.



The Rohingya who go to Bhashan Char will not be sent there against their will, said Mohammad Abul Kalam, the government’s commissioner in charge of refugee relief and repatriation.



“We will not force anyone to go to Bhashan Char,” he told BenarNews. “In line with international standards, no Rohingya will be relocated to Bhashan Char without their consent. But they will live in Bhashan Char with more facilities and safety.”



Thousands at risk of landslides, floods



On Wednesday, Shah Kamal, the government’s secretary of disaster management, briefed representatives of U.N. agencies about Bangladesh’s efforts to accommodate 100,000 refugees on Bhashan Char island.



He also talked about operations under way to move others to higher ground in Cox’s Bazar to safeguard them from the potential threat of landslides and flooding, which monsoonal rains could unleash.



So far, the government has relocated more than 11,000 Rohingya, who were living in extreme danger of landslides, floods, and cyclones, from hilly areas in Ukhia to safer ground adjacent to refugee camps, Chowdhury said.



A joint report published in late January by the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center, the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), stated about 102,000 refugees were at risk of being affected directly by landslides and floods in the Kutupalong refugee camp alone–the largest of the camps in Cox’s Bazar–and its extension area.



440 buildings



“We started the work to develop Bhashan Char in December last year. Hopefully, construction of the buildings and necessary infrastructures in the first phase of the project will be finished by the end of May,” an official with the Bangladesh Navy tasked with making the island habitable told BenarNews on condition of anonymity.



As many as 12,000 people were working to construct 440 buildings on the island, he said.



“We have built structures to protect the entire island from the risks of flooding and tidal surge. We have also built cyclone shelters to save them from cyclones,” he added.



PM meets Amnesty director



Meanwhile, in Dhaka on Thursday, Hasina met with Salil Shetty, the secretary-general of London-based Amnesty International, after he visited refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar.



In a statement form Amnesty, Shetty praised Bangladesh for its generosity in taking in thousands of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar. But he also called on Hasina’s government to “uphold its commitment that Rohingya refugees are only returned [to Myanmar] in conditions that are safe, voluntary, and dignified.”



He was referring to the bilateral deal between Dhaka and Naypyidaw last November to repatriate hundreds of thousands of the refugees to Rakhine state.



The bilateral deal called for the repatriation process to begin in late January, but the two countries have yet to repatriate any Rohingya. From a list of 8,000 refugees Bangladeshi authorities had handed over for verification by Myanmar, Naypyidaw had authorized only about 500 of them for re-entry, Kalam told BenarNews last week.



“We have taken many initiatives, but no real progress is in sight,” Hasina told Shetty during their meeting, according to her press secretary, Ihsanul Karim.



About 1 million Rohingya are sheltering in southeastern Bangladesh after having fled from spasms of violence in Rakhine.



Myanmar’s military and security forces have been widely accused of committing atrocities against Rohingya civilians during a crackdown that followed attacks on army and police posts by Rohingya insurgents in late August. Myanmar officials have denied the allegations.

3,3,FL-2018-000105-BGD,"Ten Years, Nine Floods: Local-Level Climate Adaptation in China - New Security Beat",https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2018/03/ten-years-floods-local-level-climate-adaptation-china/,"The Lanjiang river in Eastern Zhejiang, China, reached its peak water level of 100 feet the night of June 25, 2017. Lanxi residents remember this day as “6.25,” marking the worst flood since 1955. Elsewhere in China that month, 7.3 million people were affected by floods, landslides, and heavy rains in northwestern Sichuan Province alone. Northern Guangxi suffered direct economic losses of 2.9 billion RMB (US$460 million). In the autonomous regions, 92,000 people were relocated. Flash floods caused the deaths of 10 people and forced 76,800 people to evacuate from Shanxi Province.

The World Economic Forum’s most recent Global Risk Report, published in January 2018, identifies extreme weather events as the most likely and impactful risk facing the world today. China is in the top 10 percent of countries at the highest risk of major natural disasters, as well as in the top 1 percent of countries affected by drought and its impacts on agriculture. As the frequency and impact of extreme weather events and natural disasters—such as torrential rain, droughts, typhoons and heat waves—continues to increase due to global climate change, they will continue to have large impacts on small local communities like Lanxi. These problems can only be addressed through proactive measures, rather than reactive efforts.

“In the Flood, We Are Together”

In the midst of the Chinese New Year celebrations, the local government of Lanxi held a conference to draw up a “Battle Map” for the city’s safety and environmental protection efforts. A few months earlier, at the “Extraordinary Flood Summary Conference,” local officials embraced the “spirit of flood fighting” and emphasized the swift reaction of the government, army, and civilians, who all joined the “flood-fighting frontline.”

Floods, weather changes, and other environment-related events have always been considered “natural disasters.” However, like other recent extreme weather events, the 6.25 flood in Lanxi is different—it is not just a randomly occurring disaster, but a part of a pattern of increased flooding over the past few decades.

Lanxi has experienced more than one hundred floods since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, 41 of which reached critical water levels. The majority of these critical events took place in the past three decades. On June 20, 2011, the flood water levels reached 104 feet, collapsing 158 homes and affecting 16 townships, 325,000 people, and 13,800 acres of land. Direct economic losses reached 1.1 trillion RMB US($171 million). Until this past year, “6.20” was the worst flood since 1955. Although climate change is a complex phenomenon, the flooding in Lanxi is in line with local and national assessments predicting that climate change will lead to an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation and storms.

Despite Momentum, Climate Change Adaptation Gaps Persist at the Local Level

China’s National Development and Reform Commission has initiated some measures addressing adaptation planning at different levels of government. The 2013 National Adaptation Strategy, China’s first national adaptation plan, identified 14 pilot provinces and mandated the development of provincial adaptation plans. In 2016, the Urban Climate Adaptation Action Plan designated 28 pilot cities and further integrating climate adaptation into municipal governments’ urban development planning.

So far, Lanxi is not part of any of these pilots. However, some measures against flooding undertaken by the provincial government as part of the Sponge City Framework are proving to be an accidental form of adaptation.

Initiated in 2011, Yanweizhou Park (located in in Jinhua prefecture, of which Lanxi is a part) was among the first of the central government’s projects related to green infrastructure. The park is a resilient urban landscape that integrates flood-adaptive native vegetation and natural habitats in an effort to create a harmonious balance between nature and society.

Although Yanweizhou Park is part of the city’s flood and emergency management, like most climate adaptation projects, it was not planned as one. Compared to mitigation, climate adaptation’s benefits are largely invisible and require long-term planning horizons. In addition, climate adaptation involves different levels of governments, ministerial branches, and non-state actors—adding to the challenge.

A More Proactive Approach to Climate Disasters

Even though 79,200 people were affected by the flood in Lanxi in 2017, and although it received considerable attention from the district- and prefectural-level governments, it did not make international news. These fleeting moments of increased local awareness do not translate into proactive efforts to address and prepare people for climate change-related extreme weather events. Rather, ad-hoc measures continue to be the most common way of dealing with disasters not only in Lanxi, but globally.

These ad-hoc policy efforts separate natural disasters from the larger phenomenon of climate change. In this reactive pattern, the politics of attention often works against rural or impoverished populations. Human vulnerability and community exposure to climate change are sidelined by other policy demands, and adaptation is addressed only incrementally.

To integrate climate adaptation into existing disaster risk reduction frameworks, we need to connect government departments and non-state actors in different sectors. And to prepare communities like Lanxi for the future, we need to increase local-level awareness of institutional and human vulnerability to climate change—not only in China, but around the world.","Thu, 29 Mar 2018 04:04:08 GMT",https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/picture-1-huang-zezhen-300x203.jpg,"['flood', 'weather', 'lanxi', 'climate', 'natural', 'local', 'locallevel', 'change', 'extreme', 'events', 'floods', 'adaptation', 'china']", 
4,4,FL-2018-000105-BGD,Teaching girls to swim can prevent deaths during floods - India Climate Dialogue,https://indiaclimatedialogue.net/2018/03/28/teaching-girls-to-swim-would-prevent-climate-deaths/,"Teaching girls to swim can prevent deaths during floods

A global campaign to teach young girls to swim aims to save them from death by drowning during extreme weather events such as flooding that are worsened by climate change

Globally, a person dies every 1.5 seconds due to drowning, and the rate has quickened because of ever-increasing climate change impacts like large-scale flooding. The situation is all the more difficult for women and young girls who, often bound by social and cultural customs and taboos, don’t learn swimming and fall victim to such extreme weather events.

To turn this trend around, an international campaign has been launched to enhance climate resilience amongst girls by teaching them how to swim. The Teach a Girl to Swim (TAGS) campaign was publicly launched in Kolkata by Malini Mehra, an Indian civil society activist in climate change and an advisor to the head of the UN office of Disaster Risk Reduction.

After Kolkata, the campaign is scheduled to go to 12 cities across the world, with Dhaka, Beijing, Hanoi, Tokyo, Mexico and London on the immediate list. The campaign is supported and partnered by many UN bodies and organisations.

Around 360,000 people die every year due to drowning, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It is the third leading cause of preventable deaths among children after malnutrition and diarrhoea, and has been exacerbated by climate change impacts like large-scale flooding. Mehra, who swam 10 km nonstop on Sunday morning at Calcutta Swimming Club near the Ganga River to kick off the campaign, observed that women and girls are more vulnerable to flooding.

“Woman and girls often remain bound by cultural and social taboos, which do not allow them to learn swimming and are particularly vulnerable at the face of floods and related disasters, which have become more frequent and intense in recent time due to changing climate,” Mehra, who is chief executive of GLOBE International, a network of parliamentarians active on climate change, told indiaclimatedialogue.net.

Not gender-neutral

She pointed out that 90% of drowning-related deaths take place in developing countries and 50% of them involve children. “Disasters and drowning are not gender-neutral. Researches clearly point out that women and girls tend to die disproportionately higher than men and boys in disaster situations,” Mehra said. “According to IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature), in 1991, during cyclone disasters in Bangladesh, 90% of the 140,000 people who died were women. Similar trends were found during tsunamis.”

Mehra pointed out that the threat is more pronounced in countries like India, Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, Japan and the Philippines. “It is the single-largest killer of children in Bangladesh and the primary cause of injury death in children aged one to 14 in China,” she told indiaclimatedialogue.net. “We need to take the campaign to those girls who are from socioeconomically challenged parts of society and, more often than not, do not have the access and opportunity to learn swimming. “

On choosing Kolkata as the starting point of her campaign, Mehra said, “It was not only because I originally belong to this city but also because the city had a large number of swimming pools in my growing up period, almost like London.” Mehra is currently based in London.

Safety swimming

She said that a key focus of her advocacy is to ensure that “safety swimming for girls should be included in national climate change and disaster risk reduction strategies as a key element of the country’s adaptation to climate change.”

Apart from providing protection in case of a flood-like situation, swimming can also help provide appropriate lung fitness to children in this era of air pollution. “Look at the cities like Kolkata or Dhaka, and the range of diseases children have to suffer due to pollution,” Mehra said. “Regular swimming can be a great antidote and help in children getting appropriate lung fitness.”

Mehra plans to showcase the results of her campaign to the world during the next global climate summit that will be held in Poland in December this year.","Wed, 28 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://indiaclimatedialogue.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Tags.jpg,"['children', 'climate', 'teaching', 'kolkata', 'change', 'swim', 'women', 'prevent', 'mehra', 'floods', 'girls', 'campaign', 'swimming', 'deaths']",

Almost nine months later, that welcome is starting to wear thin as the exodus far exceeds past influxes of Rohingya refugees and settles into a prolonged, seemingly intractable situation, taxing one of the world’s poorest and most densely populated countries.

Bangladesh, no stranger to the Myanmar military’s paroxysms of ethno-nationalist violence, has historically provided shelter to the persecuted Muslim Rohingya minority from next door. Desperate masses arrived in 1978, followed by more in 1991 when a quarter of a million Rohingya fled violence in overwhelmingly Buddhist Myanmar. Sectarian clashes in 2012 prompted another wave.

According to the officials, who didn’t want to be identified, this project of the Central Water Commission with the help of the Survey of India and the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) of the Indian Space Research Organisation will help local administrations reduce the loss of life and damage to property during floods.

Countries such as the United States are already using digital flood maps successfully. But the flood warning system in India is based on water-level forecasting, which tries to predict how much the level will rise by calculating the flow of water into dams and reservoirs, the officials said.

“For the first time the government will predict inundation areas at different levels of water. For example, which areas will be affected when a river’s water is a foot above the danger mark, or two feet above,” a senior ministry official said. “An evacuation plan can be made accordingly.”

The atlas, officially named “inundation flood advisory”, will be most useful in Assam where the Brahmaputra swells every monsoon and submerges large tracts of land, including the Kaziranga national park, the Majuli river island and scores of villages close to its banks.

In a pilot project, the government has mapped the Brahmaputra basin from eastern Assam’s Dibrugarh district to the international border from where the river enters Bangladesh to drain out into the Bay of Bengal. The high-resolution mapping with satellite imagery includes areas within a 2km kilometer radius of the river’s banks.

According to data released by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority, the state recorded its worst floods in four years in 2017 as the Brahmaputra and its tributaries breached their banks and inundated about 2,500 villages, displacing more than 1.8 million people.

The water resources ministry’s atlas project will help the state administration work with communities to protect lives — human and livestock — and property by providing tools and information to help them understand flood risks and make cost-effective mitigation decisions, the officials said.

The ministry is also planning to issue similar flood atlases for all the 20 river basins in the country by 2020. According to the officials, this will be an important step as many regions, other than the Northeast, have struggled with floods — such as flooding by the Jhelum in Srinagar and the Koshi in Bihar.

The maps for the Brahmaputra basin have been developed using 30 years of hydrological data, information on the frequency of floods, and highest recorded flooding in a particular area.

Researchers at the University of New Hampshire have found that in the past 20 years roads along the East Coast have experienced a 90 percent increase in flooding – often making the roads in these communities impassable, causing delays, as well as stress, and impacting transportation of goods and services.

“This could be just the beginning of impact on these areas,” said Jennifer Jacobs, professor of civil and environmental engineering. “With the continued rise in sea levels, nuisance-flood frequency is projected to grow and the effect on the physical roads and the people that live along the coastline is concerning.”

In their study, Recent and Future Outlooks for Nuisance Flooding Impacts on Roadways on the US East Coast, published in the journal Transportation Research Record, the researchers found that tidal nuisance flooding threatens over 7,500 miles of roadways along the entire East Coast, with over 400 miles of that being interstate roads.

The researchers estimate that this flooding causes more than 100 million hours of delays each year for drivers on those roads and that number could rise to more than 3.4 billion hours by 2100. By the middle of the century (2056 –2065), they predict nuisance flooding could occur almost daily at specific sites along the shores of Connecticut, New Jersey, Maryland, the District of Columbia, North Carolina, and Florida under an intermediate sea-level-rise scenario.

They cite other research indicating that the cumulative cost of nuisance flooding could match or exceed costs from extreme coastal storm events. They also report that currently there are 91 communities where 10 percent or more of livable land area is flooded at least 26 times per year, a number likely to nearly double by 2035.

“As tidal coastal flooding increases in the coming years, there will also be issues with the transportation infrastructure,” said Jacobs. “We’ve already seen billions of dollars in damage to coastal roadways from recent hurricanes. In the future, with rising sea levels, we expect to see more frequent issues, more damage, and impact to roadways even farther inland.”

Researchers note that these impacts are not limited to storm events. They say that critical transportation infrastructure is at risk from sea level rise alone; which numerous transportation agencies project to be between one to eight feet, along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coasts.

The goal of the study is to better understand the type and extent of roadway infrastructures that are vulnerable to high tide flooding and the transportation impacts now and in the future due to sea level rise. This study focuses on the East Coast of the United States and includes all coastal states from Maine to Florida, including the Gulf Coast of Florida and Key West.

Vulnerable roads were identified using data from the Federal Highway Administration’s Highway Performance Monitoring System and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services. They looked at flood frequency maps, tidal gauge historic observations, and future projections of annual minor tidal flood frequencies and durations.

This research was funded by U.S. National Science Foundation research grant.

9,9,FL-2018-000105-BGD,Federal Flood Insurance Average Premium to Rise 8% - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2018/04/02/485019.htm,"A typical premium charged by the National Flood Insurance Program is slated to rise about eight percent in the coming year, with the estimated average premium going from $866 to $935.

When various surcharges are added, the total average amount billed a policyholder will increase to $1,062.

However the premium hikes are likely insufficient to keep the program from sinking into debt, according to a recent government report.

The higher premiums and other changes for new businesses and renewals began April 1, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in a bulletin summarizing NFIP program changes effective April 1, 2018. The changes bring the NFIP in line with provisions of flood insurance reform laws including the Biggert Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 and the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014.

The 2012 and 2014 flood insurance laws’ requirements behind the premium and surcharge increases include:

Premium rates for four categories of Pre-FIRM subsidized policies – non-primary residential properties, business properties, Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL) properties (which includes cumulatively damaged properties), and substantially damaged/substantially improved properties – must be increased 25 percent annually until they reach full-risk rates;

The average annual premium rate increases for all other risk classes are limited to 15 percent while the individual premium rate increase for any individual policy is simultaneously limited to 18 percent; and

The average annual premium rate increase for all other Pre-FIRM subsidized policies not covered by the 25 percent category above must be at least 5 percent.

There are some limited exceptions to the 18 percent cap on premium rate increases for individual policyholders. These include policies on the properties that are subject to 25 percent annual premium rate increases.

The surcharges are not considered premium and, therefore, are not subject to the premium rate cap limitations. As a result, the increase in the total amount charged a policyholder may exceed 18 percent in some cases.

On March 23, the NFIP was reauthorized until July 31, 2018. The extension was included in the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill signed by President Donald Trump.

The disasters of 2017 created one of the busiest years for the NFIP to date —by the end of last year, FEMA said the NFIP had paid out more than $8 billion in flood insurance claims during 2017.

State of Flood Insurance in the U.S.

Last October, Congress passed and President Trump signed into law a hurricane and wildfire disaster relief bill that provided $16 billion in debt relief to the NFIP, which was about to run out of money to pay claims from hurricanes because it had reached the $30 billion limit on its ability to borrow form the U.S. Treasury.

According to a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report issued last fall (National Flood Insurance Program Financial Soundness and Affordability), these latest premium increases are unlikely to keep the NFIP from eventually falling into the red again. That’s because the NFIP’s current approach to setting premiums has underestimated how much its claims will cost by about $1.1 billion and legislated surcharges are about $300 million shy of covering the premium discounts given to certain properties, according to the CBO.

CBO concluded that the overall NFIP shortfall is largely caused by underpricing in coastal counties, which account for three-quarters of all NFIP policies nationwide. The difference is largely due to legislated subsidies built into the NFIP and FEMA’s rate-setting system, both of which it says favor coastal policyholders.

Yet despite being favored in pricing, the number of coastal homes with flood insurance has been falling, according to a report by The Associated Press. Why the decline? The report cited rising premiums and banks not enforcing the requirement that any home with a federally insured mortgage in a high-risk area have flood coverage.

The House has passed several reforms of the NFIP but the Senate has not advanced any measures.

Preparations for the rains are in full force throughout the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, which aid workers fear will bring devastation to the thousands of shelters precariously balanced on uneven land near the Burma border.

Those on the ground fear landslides and flooding will damage the tents, render the labyrinth of tiny, unpaved roads that crisscross the camps impassable, block access roads and potentially turn the settlement into a breeding ground for contagious disease.

More than 650,000 people, mainly Rohingya, have fled neighbouring Burma since August last year – forming what is believed to be the world’s largest refugee camp.

The ethnic minority group, which is mainly Muslim, rapidly crossed the border into southern Bangladesh reporting extreme violence and human rights violations.

The land is more vulnerable to the coming conditions after the widespread destruction of forested areas for fuel and building materials as a vast number of Rohingya settled spontaneously.

The camps largely consist of tens of thousands of bamboo and tarpaulin shacks without foundations.

According to the UN refugee agency UNHCR, an area the size of almost 120 rugby fields is landslide-prone, putting 23,000 people at serious risk, while more than 30% of the main camps and nearly 80,000 people could be hit by floods.

Almost half of the 7,275 hand pumps in the camps are in landslide or flood-prone areas, as are one quarter of the 19,000-plus latrines.

Aid workers have spent the past months reinforcing hills to prevent mudslides, building drainage systems in the lower levels of the camps to channel away dirty water and waste and strengthening buildings, such as health clinics and food distribution points, with concrete.

The first of the families deemed at greatest risk have begun to be relocated to higher ground, where charities are also stockpiling key aid materials in newly built warehouses.

“Our understanding is that over 100,000 Rohingya refugees are directly threatened by landslides and floods – that is quite a conservative estimate.

“As you know there are hundreds of thousands of refugees in those camps and every single person to some degree is placed in a precarious situation because their houses are made out of flimsy materials, their floors are made out of sand, which as we know the second it starts raining will turn into mud.”

Many people approached by the Press Association in the camps expressed fears about the coming rains but said that they did not know where else they could go.

Minara Begum, 20, arrived in the Kerantoli camp six months ago with her young son. They fled Burma after her husband was shot dead.

“The tarpaulin can fly away and the rain can come into the house so we could easily get sick, and we don’t have anywhere else to go. I’m really worried because I don’t know how to keep my tent safe.”

A potential health disaster may also be on the horizon, with the risk of latrines overflowing and contaminating clean water supplies.

Dominic McEvoy, who trained as a nurse in Ireland, has been working with Save the Children in the camps for two months.

The 32-year-old said: “We’ve just come through a crisis with diphtheria, and that seems to have gotten under control, as we approach the monsoon season we are expecting a big increase in diarrhoea-causing diseases, and diseases spread by mosquitoes, so we’re trying to get mosquito nets out and also encourage better hand hygiene and access to clean drinking water.”

Save the Children, the UN and other agencies are urging governments across the globe to fund a new 950 million US dollars response plan.

So far, they have raised 1.6 million US dollars – just 0.2% of the total.

Voreqe Bainimarama said the island nation now faces a “fight for survival” as climate change brings “almost constant” deadly tropical cyclones.

The islands avoided a direct hit by Cyclone Josie on Sunday, but the storm brought heavy rains, high winds and flooding, which caused extensive damage to homes, businesses and vehicles on the main island of Viti Levu.

More than 1,000 people remained in evacuation centres this week following the cyclone.

Mr Bainimarama said climate change was causing extreme weather events to become more severe and occur more often.

In 2016 Cyclone Winston, the most intense tropical storm in the southern hemisphere on record, left 44 people dead and 40,000 homes significantly damaged or destroyed after making landfall on Fiji.

The category 5 cyclone saw ten-minute sustained wind speeds of 175kmh (110mph), and a record wind gust of 306kmh (190mph) was measured.

In the past, major storms have been less frequent on the islands, with the strongest cyclone before Winston being the Category 4 cyclone Evan, in 2012, in which no one died. The deadliest cyclone before Winston was 1979’s Cyclone Meli, which claimed 53 lives.

""We are now at an almost constant level of threat from these extreme weather events,"" Mr Bainimarama said on Tuesday.

Climate change had made the danger “more severe”, he said, and called for global action on reducing carbon emissions. “We need to get the message out loud and clear to the entire world about the absolute need to confront this crisis head on.”

“As a nation we are starting to build our resilience in response to the frightening new era that is upon us.” It is a “fight for our very survival”, he added. “We are now at an almost constant level of threat”.

Volcanic eruptions alter the climate by spewing smoke and ash into the atmosphere, but scientists now also think the opposite might be true – changes in climate could actually cause volcanic eruptions.

According to Gioachino Roberti, a PhD student at the University of Clermont Auvergne, glaciers can suppress volcanic eruptions by providing mountains with structural stability.

Recommended Natural disasters increasingly linked to climate change

As the climate becomes warmer, ice melting from these mountains removes support from their slopes, potentially leading to landslides and collapse.

“Imagine the ice like some sort of protective layer – when the ice melts away, the mountain is free to collapse,” said Mr Roberti.

“If your mountain is a volcano you have another problem.

“Volcanoes are a pressurised system and if you remove pressure by ice melting and landslide, you have a problem.”

Presenting his work at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly, Mr Roberti explained a case study he and his collaborators had investigated in Canada.

Though not famous for its volcanic activity, Canada is home to hundreds of potentially active volcanoes. The scientists chose to focus on Mount Meager, a glaciated volcano north of Vancouver.

Mount Meager’s last eruption was over 2000 years ago, but Mr Roberti chose to focus on Mount Meager for a more recent natural disaster that took place there.

In summer 2010, the largest landslide in Canadian history occurred on the southern part of the volcano.

“The glacier base of the slope retreated and during the hottest part of the summer, the slope catastrophically failed – the whole mountain started to move at a very high velocity,” said Mr Roberti.

This was followed in 2016 by the formation of ice caves in the glacier as hot volcanic gases seeped out of the volcano.

“This is the first time this has happened there – so the equilibrium of the mountain is changing,” said Mr Roberti.

To understand these events, the scientists used numerical modelling of the volcano to examine the link between melting ice on the glacier and changes to the magma “plumbing system” inside it.

They found that landslides had the potential to destabilise the magma chamber and trigger an eruption – a phenomenon that can be linked directly to a warmer climate.

“We see a correlation between high temperature, ice melting and landslides,” said Mr Roberti.

✕ Japanese volcano featured in James Bond film erupts

“Today’s increasing temperature is likely to cause other large landslides.”

Other scientists welcomed the research by Mr Roberti and his colleagues, although they noted the complexity of the systems involved and the difficulty in making direct links between climate change and eruptions.

“This new research nicely demonstrates that if you change the load on a volcanic mountain – for example by removing some ice – the likelihood of a mechanical collapse and possible ensuing eruption will be slightly increased,” said Professor David Rothery, a geoscientist at The Open University who was not involved in the research.

“Eruptions are triggered by a complex array of factors. I suspect that many eruptions caused by glacial melting might happen eventually anyway, given enough time – but this research shows that warming could increase the chances of those eruptions happening sooner rather than later.”

Dr David McGarvie, another researcher at The Open University who was not involved with the research, said that evidence is still lacking for ice-capped volcanoes like Mount Meager erupting due to ice melting. However, he noted this was not the case for volcanoes buried under ice sheets in Iceland and Antarctica.

“There is more and better evidence across Iceland that when the ice sheet underwent major reduction at the end of the last glacial period, there was a large increase in both the frequency and volume of basalt erupted – with some estimates being 30 times higher than the present day,” he said.

However, he said the scale of ice melting currently being seen is not on the same scale as the end of the glacial period.

Presenting his research alongside Mr Roberti was Matthias Schlögl, a PhD student at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna, whose studies also focused on climate change-driven landslides.

As landslides tend to be caused by heavy rainfall – which is expected to increase due to climate change – these events are likely to become more common in the future.

Mr Schlögl’s research has explored the impact such landslides will have on Europe’s transport network.

“Landslides are an important issue today, and we expect that climate change – particularly changes in rainfall patterns and changes in temperature – will increase, and will furthermore affect the slope stability and trigger additional landslide events in the future,” Mr Schlögl said.

Scientists are becoming increasingly confident in attributing the rise in frequency and severity of natural disasters to climate change.

The drought currently affecting Cape Town has been linked with climate change, as was Hurricane Harvey when it struck the south east US at the end of 2017.

The new results presented by these researchers suggests that geological phenomena as well as weather events are being fundamentally altered by the changing climate.","Wed, 11 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/11/15/mayon-volcano-erupt.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['believe', 'volcanic', 'climate', 'doesnt', 'melting', 'change', 'mr', 'ice', 'photographs', 'roberti', 'eruptions', 'trigger', 'warn', 'world', 'scientists']",

The scheme (on a 25 km stretch of the Yamuna) is currently running at half its potential and providing water to about one million people in the city — of a daily requirement of 150 litres per person.

Conserve and use plan

Floodplains are formed over millions of years by the flooding of rivers and deposition of sand on riverbanks. These sandy floodplains are exceptional aquifers where any withdrawal is compensated by gravity flow from a large surrounding area. Some floodplains such as those of Himalayan rivers contain up to 20 times more water than the virgin flow in rivers in a year. Since recharge is by rainfall and during late floods, the water quality is good. If we conserve and use the floodplain, it can be a self-sustaining aquifer wherein every year, the river and floodplain are preserved in the same healthy condition as the year before. The ‘conserve and use’ principle demands that no more than is recharged by rain and floods each year can be withdrawn from this aquifer. This ensures that the groundwater level in the floodplains remains steadily above that in the river in the lean non-monsoon months when the river is often polluted. Drawing out any more water than is recharged can contaminate and eventually finish off this precious resource.

Rivers today are facing problems of abysmally low flows due to an indiscriminate extraction of water for use in cities, industries and agriculture. They are also highly polluted because sewage and effluents are being released into them. But a floodplains ‘conserve and use’ scheme, which is a socio-economic-environmental scheme, can provide water to urban centres along rivers; it can also engage farmers by providing them an assured income and restore rivers to a healthy condition.

The Tamirabarani

Let us take the example of the Tamirabarani river in Tamil Nadu which flows for 100 km through two urban settlements, Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi. For the population of close to a million people in these two cities, the water requirement of both towns combined is less than 54 million cubic metres (MCM) per year, when calculated at 150 litres a day per person. Leaving out the area of the river banks that is built over, we are left with 75 km of river length which is agricultural land; 1 km of this stretch on both sides of the river can be preserved as a water sanctuary and used to provide water to towns.

This floodplain (75 km) absorbs about 50% of the rainfall (about 100 cm/ year) and saturates during floods late in the monsoon. Flooding can cause an approximately 4 metre rise in the water level which allows us to dewater about 3 metre depth of floodplain. The specific yield of this aquifer is about 15-20% of its volume and hence we can draw about 75-90 MCM of water from the floodplains in a year.

Floodplains have more water than the needs of cities. Half the water can be drawn and provided to meet the needs of cities by developing a grid of about 120 wells, each of which operate at 0.3 million gallons a day. If priced at the domestic Delhi Jal Board tariff of ₹30 per kilo litre, we can sell the water for ₹162 crore a year.

Engaging farmers

Preserving the floodplain in its entirety is critical for this scheme to work. This can be done by engaging farmers whose land will have to be leased for such an effort. Farmers today have an erratic income and this scheme can be realised through a public-private partnership, where farmers on this land tract of 1 km on either side of the river can be provided an assured and steady income of ₹30,000 an acre which would amount to ₹112 crore a year for the first 10 years for the entire river length (75 km) that is not encroached. In addition, farmers can grow a food forest, fruit orchards or nut trees but not water-intensive crops on this land. It would guarantee not only a good farming income but also great earnings from the water for the farmers without taking the ownership of the land away from them. The capital cost for building such a scheme would be minimal (a few hundred crores) and the revenue generated would be able to pay for the costs and for farmers’ income without any subsidy. It would also generate substantial revenue for the cities.

Ecologically, a water sanctuary would prevent erosion, heal the river ecosystem, and restore the ecological balance in floodplains. Even after withdrawal, floodplains would have enough water to slowly release back into the river in a lean season. This scheme would help curb illegal extraction of water, stop pollution by local agencies and industries and also encourage cities to be more responsible in their waste management.

This scheme will also help improve the quality of rivers, quality of life for citizens, and at the same time guarantee farmers a healthy fixed income. This is a new scheme of living. This is the philosophy of “conserve and use”.

15,15,FL-2018-000105-BGD,"India At High Risk Of Food Shortage Due To Climate Change, Says Study - Outlook India",https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-at-risk-of-food-shortage-due-to-climate-change-says-study/310396,"India is among the countries which are at the greatest risk of food insecurity due to weather extremes caused by climate change, a global study suggests.

Researchers led by the University of Exeter in the UK examined how climate change could affect the vulnerability of different countries to food insecurity - when people lack access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food.

The study, published in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, looked at 122 developing and least-developed countries, mostly in Asia, Africa and South America.

The countries at the greatest vulnerability to food insecurity when moving from the present-day climate to 2 degrees Celsius global warming are Oman, India, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, researchers said.

""Climate change is expected to lead to more extremes of both heavy rainfall and drought, with different effects in different parts of the world,"" said Richard Betts, a professor at the University of Exeter.

""Such weather extremes can increase vulnerability to food insecurity,"" said Betts.

""Some change is already unavoidable, but if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, this vulnerability is projected to remain smaller than at 2 degrees Celsius in approximately 76 per cent of developing countries,"" he said.

Warming is expected to lead to wetter conditions on average - with floods putting food production at risk - but agriculture could also be harmed by more frequent and prolonged droughts in some areas, researchers said.

Wetter conditions are expected to have the biggest impact in South and East Asia, with the most extreme projections suggesting the flow of the River Ganges could more than double at 2 degrees Celsius global warming, they said.

""Some areas are projected to see an increase in flood event lengths of 4 days or more, particularly India and Bangladesh, for which such increases are projected in all ensemble members to some extent, researchers said.

The areas worst affected by droughts are expected to be southern Africa and South America - where flows in the Amazon are projected to decline by up to 25 per cent, according to the researchers.

They examined projected changes in weather extremes and their implications for freshwater availability and vulnerability to food insecurity.

16,16,FL-2018-000105-BGD,China to resume sharing Brahmaputra hydrological data with India - Livemint,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/FIKhNhmvGzrThivAVxzEcP/China-to-resume-sharing-Brahmaputra-hydrological-data-with.html,"Beijing: China said on Wednesday it will resume sharing with India the hydrological data of the Brahmaputra river as top water resource officials of the two countries wrapped up two-day talks, the first after Beijing last year stopped providing the data crucial to predict floods.

“On the basis of humanitarian spirit and our shared will to develop bilateral ties we will continue with the cooperation on hydrological information cooperation,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a media briefing here.

He was responding to a question whether China will resume sharing of the hydrological data on Brahmaputra river, which Beijing suspended last year stating that it could not share it with India due to upgradation of data collection station in Tibet.

China’s announcement to not to share the data came soon after the 73-day long stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops at Dokalam over Chinese military’s plans to build a road close to India’s Chicken Neck corridor connecting North-Eastern states.

A team of officials of India’s Ministry of Water Resources held talks with their Chinese counterparts on the cooperation of trans-border rivers in the last two days at the Chinese city of Hangzhou, the first after Beijing last year stopped providing the data.

Lu said during the talks the two sides reviewed the achievements of the previous meetings as well as bilateral cooperation on emergency and response and hydrological information.

“The two sides have agreed to continue with such cooperation. On the grounds of humanitarian principles and the basis of bilateral relations China will continue with this cooperation with the Indian side on the provision of hydrological information and emergency response cooperation,"" Lu said.

Asked whether China would resume the data, Lu said “since you made it quite clear"", China will continue with the cooperation on hydrological information cooperation.

The two-day talks of the 11th meeting of the India-China Expert Level Mechanism (ELM) on Trans-Border Rivers concluded yesterday at Hangzhou, a statement from the Indian Embassy here said today.

The Indian side was led by Teerath Singh Mehra, Commissioner (B&B), Ministry of Water Resources and the Chinese side by Yu Xingjun, Consul, Department of International Cooperation Science and Technology, Ministry of Water Resources.

The meeting which was held in a “cordial and friendly"" atmosphere reviewed the progress made since the earlier meetings of the ELM and their continued cooperation on provision of hydrological information and emergency management in respect of trans-border rivers, the press release said.

The officials also reviewed the data utilisation report upon provision of hydrological information provided by China to India in flood season on Brahmaputra and Sutlej Rivers.

The institutional mechanism of the ELM was established in 2006 to discuss various issues related to trans-border rivers. Under existing bilateral Memorandums of Understanding, China provides to India hydrological information of Brahmaputra River (Yarlong Zangbo) and Sutlej River (Langqen Zangbo) during the flood seasons.

Under the arrangement, China provides flood season data of the Brahmaputra river between 15 May and 15 October every year. China has been building major dams on Brahmaputra river to generate hydel power. It operationalised Zangmu hydroelectric project in October, 2015 and three more are under construction.

While dams raised concerns of water shortages in India and Bangladesh, which are lower riparian states of Brahmaputra river, China said its dams were aimed at generating power and not storing water.

The data shared by upper riparian state, China, to lower riparian states, India and Bangladesh is essential every monsoon to allow anticipation of the flow of the water and take necessary measures to deal with flooding in India’s north-eastern States.

17,17,FL-2018-000105-BGD,Frivolous phone calls flood emergency helpline 999 - Dhaka Tribune,https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/special/2018/04/01/frivolous-phone-calls-flood-emergency-helpline-999,"Many people make unnecessary phone calls keeping the number busy without even knowing that it is distracting us from providing service to people who really need it

Most phone calls received by the national emergency helpline 999 are from curious people, due to the public not being aware of the fact that the service is only for emergency and on-spot services. These calls fall into three categories- prank calls, missed calls and blank calls. The helpline receives as many as 70,000 to 80,000 prank calls each month, which are basically disturbing or annoying calls while around 90,000 calls are miss calls, said officials. The number of blank calls, where people actually call but do not talk, are also high in number. “We receive 17,000 calls on average per day. Among them, the numbers of such calls is high; but still, we provide our mandated services as fast as possible if the call is actually a Call for Service (CFS),” Mohammad Tabarak Ullah, Superintendent of Police at National Emergency Service 999 said. The helpline, in fact, has three services as its mandate- police, ambulance and fire service. If services are provided, only these calls are considered as CFS. Any citizen of the country is entitled to dial the number as toll free and the services will be provided from its office at police control room in Dhaka city’s Abdul Gani Road area.Since its official launch on December 12, 2017, it has received 36,8095 calls from Dec 12 to Dec 31, 516899 in January, 478393 in February and around 30000 from March 1 to 14. Out of the CFS calls, the helpline also has many success stories for providing instant services- connecting the service seeker and the service provider immediately. On March 14 afternoon, Tofayel, a travel agency official, noticed a woman giving birth by the roadside close to Shahjalal University of Science and Technology in Sylhet. The woman did not have any clothes on and was bleeding. He immediately called 999 and within few minutes, police contacted with him and an ambulance was sent to the spot. Later, the mother and the infant were taken to MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital safely, thanks to the helpline. Citing another experience, Constable Ismat Jahan, a call taker at the helpline office, said they have foiled a child marriage after a neighbor made a phone call saying a 14 year old girl was getting married to an 18 year boy in Chittagong. The helpline immediately connected him with the nearest police station and a police contingent was immediately sent, foiling the attempt, she said. “Still people do not know we can provide only three mandated services and it is actually an on-the-spot service. We only cater to emergency situations. Many people make unnecessary phone calls keeping the number busy without even knowing that it is distracting us from providing service to people who really need it. However, the numbers of such calls were most in the beginning. It’s happening less now,” said Tabarak. Among the service seekers, people call to talk about issues such as crime, violence against women, child marriage, family problems, theft, hijack and clashes. During this period, the helpline provided mandated services to 13,804 calls including highest 7708 for police supports, 2800 for fire service and 188 for ambulance. The helpline also provides services to inquiry calls. The number of inquiry calls responded were around 46,000 in December, 68,000 in January, 85,000 in February, and 40,000 in March. “We receive around 50 calls for CFS and hotline service per shift. Currently, about 200 staff is working here in three shifts. We receive the highest number of calls from 2pm to 8pm,” said inspector Mohammad Abu Naser, supervisor and trainer at the office. The helpline can now respond to 30 calls at a time, but the authorities are working to raise it to 100 by next six to eight months because of the overwhelming response from the public, said Tabarak.","Sun, 01 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2018/04/WEB_National-helpline_edited-690x450.gif,"['flood', 'number', '999', 'cfs', 'emergency', 'tabarak', 'phone', 'immediately', 'service', 'calls', 'helpline', 'frivolous', 'services']",

The Gulf Stream current, which has not been running at peak strength for centuries, is now at its weakest point in the past 1,600 years.

Climate change resulting from rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a likely cause of this phenomenon.

The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (Amoc), the system of currents that transports warm water from the tropics via the Gulf Stream to the North Atlantic, plays a major role in regulating the world’s climate.

A fictional depiction of Amoc’s collapse was portrayed in The Day After Tomorrow, and while the film’s events were exaggerated, scientists say severe weather events are likely to result from the ongoing changes.

If the system continues to slow down, there could be weather disruption across the US, Europe and Africa, and sea levels could rise rapidly on the US east coast.

Two international teams of scientists have undertaken extensive analyses of sea surface temperature data and underwater sediments. Both studies were published in the journal Nature.

In both papers, the researchers found Amoc had slowed down by roughly 15 per cent, although the timescales over which this weakening had taken place were very different.

While one study found the dip had occurred over the past 150 years, the other concluded it had happened rapidly since the 1950s.

“We detected a specific pattern of ocean cooling south of Greenland and unusual warming off the US coast – which is highly characteristic for a slowdown of the Atlantic overturning, also called the Gulf Stream system,” said Levke Caesar from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, the lead author of one of the studies.

“It is practically like a fingerprint of a weakening of these ocean currents.”

The circulation of the Atlantic Ocean plays a key role in regulating global climate. The constantly moving system of deep-water circulation, sometimes referred to as the Global Ocean Conveyor Belt, sends warm, salty Gulf Stream water to the North Atlantic where it releases heat to the atmosphere and warms Western Europe. The cooler water then sinks to great depths and travels all the way to Antarctica and eventually circulates back up to the Gulf Stream (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)

While computer simulations have long predicted changes in ocean circulation, brought about by rising carbon dioxide levels, these studies provide direct proof this is happening.

“The evidence we’re now able to provide is the most robust to date,” said Professor Stefan Rahmstorf from the Potsdam Institute, who conceived the study with Ms Caesar.

“We’ve analysed all the available sea surface temperature datasets, comprising data from the late 19th century until the present.”

The other study used ocean sediments to explore the weakening Amoc over a longer period of time.

Taken together, the studies provide a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenon, and the scientists suggest climate change is likely to be driving the effects they are seeing.

Increased rainfall as well as melt water from Arctic sea ice – both of which are the result of global warming – are thought to be diluting the waters of the northern Atlantic.

This reduces the ocean’s salt content, making it less dense and stopping water from sinking to the seabed. This in turn slows down Amoc, which is driven by the flux of water with different densities.

Previous work has demonstrated that the decline of Amoc has the potential to exacerbate sea level rise in coastal US cities like New York and Boston, as well driving extreme weather events such as storms and even heatwaves.

While the recent studies did not attempt to predict the future of Amoc, the researchers warned that climate change is likely to continue driving this worrying trend.

“If we do not rapidly stop global warming, we must expect a further long-term slowdown of the Atlantic overturning,” said Dr Alexander Robinson of the University of Madrid, one of the study authors.

“We are only beginning to understand the consequences of this unprecedented process – but they might be disruptive.”","Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/12/09/storm-surge-us.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['low', 'photographs', 'stream', 'amoc', 'record', 'current', 'weather', 'gulf', 'scientists', 'warn', 'ocean', 'potentially', 'sea', 'believe', 'water', 'climate', 'doesnt', 'change', 'devastating', 'atlantic']",

Connected to the marshes and moss-laced bayous of southern Louisiana by two miles of narrow causeway, waters lapping high on each side, Isle de Jean Charles takes you as far into the Gulf of Mexico as you can go without falling in. But the dolour in the salt air is not just about loneliness and separation. It’s about impending demise.

Don’t call it a death sentence – the intention is the opposite – but state officials in late March made the announcement that had been a long time coming. Some on the island, nearly all members of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indian tribe, met it with relief; others with hostility.

Marking the kick-off of what will be the first climate resettlement of its kind in the entire United States, land had been chosen an hour’s drive to the north for a whole new town to be thrown up. No one will force them exactly, but the intention is clear: to evacuate those still living on the island to the new site, where at present nothing but sugar cane stands, before it is too late.

Recommended What Puerto Rico can teach us about surviving climate change

When that will be depends on whom you ask. But no one disputes that the island is sinking, thanks to a combination of subsidence and rising sea levels. Where there were 22,000 acres in 1955 there are only 320 acres today. Climate change isn’t helping, but the principal problem traces back to the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 when the corps of engineers responded by building giant levees to constrain the river. The result was stopping the flow of sediment into its delta, which once gave the state’s barrier islands the material to rebuild as fast as they eroded.

The vanishing of Isle de Jean Charles into the waves of the gulf might take another decade or even five. On the other hand, one more big storm could finally end its viability for human occupation for good, flooding homes beyond repair or cutting through the connecting road.

“The next hurricane could force all of them, at that point, to move,” Thomas Dardar notes, navigating his truck along the causeway on Palm Sunday morning. The Chief of the United Houma Nation, another large Louisiana tribe, with several close relatives on the island, has been deeply involved in helping to forge the resettlement plan with the state. He is therefore anxious for it to succeed. But he is equally aware of the multiple hurdles it still faces.

Success matters because at least in the eyes of Chief Thomas, as well as Pat Forbes, executive director of the Louisiana Office of Community Development which must execute the resettlement, a blueprint is being drawn that one day will be followed by countless other communities confronted by climate extinction, maybe in Louisiana, which is losing coastal territory at the rate of one football field per hour, or elsewhere in the country. Or the world.

“It’s really a test run,” Mr Forbes concedes in an interview from his Baton Rouge office. While Americans may have been displaced by environmental change before, notably in Alaska, no single community has been relocated lock, stock and barrel like this. “We are trying to keep the community intact and ensure that it’s economically and socially vibrant and viable. To our knowledge, it’s unique. There are places around the world who are looking at a similar type of thing but nobody in the US has done this.”

Theo Chaisson wants to know what will become of his marina business if the island is evacuated (David Usborne)

Which makes residents on Isle de Jean Charles canaries in the mineshaft. And if they are not opposed outright, they see problems and pitfalls everywhere, a couple of which emerged at the most recent of the monthly community meetings on the island, instituted by Mr Forbes to make sure their concerns are heard. For example: moving the quick is one thing, but what about the dead? What does the state propose doing about their ancestors beneath the island’s overgrown cemetery? (There may be as many as 200 resting there, but one estimate puts the number at only 50.)

Then there is the matter of Theo Chaisson and the small marina he has run for 30 years at the island’s tip. On our visit it bustled with pleasure-boaters and fisherfolk using the dock and slip. His family left for drier land in 1948, but his business is his livelihood. What will become of it if the island is abandoned? No one knows, and that leaves him unsettled and a little angry. He questions why the $48m (£34m) granted by Washington, specifically the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), to pay for the evacuation hadn’t instead been assigned to build better flood defences.

“I don’t think it’s necessary,” Chaisson, 81, says of the resettlement plan. “This here will go,” he adds, gesturing from the elevated deck at the back of his tackle shop to the dry land still remaining, “but not right now. It’s good for another 25 years for sure, or better.” He expects the state will eventually be forced to offer him cash to shut down, although nothing to that effect is settled yet. “I am not for sale,” he says defiantly. “I’ll tell them, ‘No, no no’” – maybe. “With a lot of money, I might be interested. I might be interested.”

Breaking off repeatedly to greet customers looking to buy bait, cold beers or new hooks for their lines, Chaisson argues people can make up their own minds whether to stay and brave the next hurricane or flee. “The ones that want to go, they left already,” he reckons. “They’ve gone.”

Some have. Scan the creaky wood-framed homes that line the single road on the island, many perched perilously high on 15-foot pilings, and several appear abandoned, doors and windows swung open. The fire station was shuttered long ago. There are only 45 adults and 12 children still living on Isle de Jean Charles, according to state officials. A year ago, there were 93 full-time residents. Some who left took up an offer made last November to move to interim housing in the city of Houma, further inland, while they wait for the new community to be built. But the exodus really began after Hurricane Katrina savaged the island back in 2005.

Ground should be broken at the new site north of Houma by year’s end, and the new town – homes, streets, shops, playgrounds – could be ready by 2022, not just for those still on the island but also those already gone. But there are other legal issues beyond the cemetery and the marina. Will relocation really be voluntary? (Mr Forbes is adamant it will.) If the residents do leave will they have to surrender ownership of their properties? Will they be allowed to visit them? Much depends, Mr Forbes admits, “on how far we can push the federal regulatory structure”. In other words, the money from Washington comes with conditions.

Sitting in shade beneath the stilts of the home that has been in his family for seven generations, Chris Brunet, 52, agrees that the uncertainties still make him wary. “We are working on how we can come out on the better end of the deal,” he explains. But the idea of having to leave has clearly taken root in him. “Eventually, eventually,” he says. “But things can’t be done overnight and that’s what we are dealing with right now in making my decisions. Saying ‘yes’ to it.”

Legalities aside, it’s also what they will lose that weighs heavily on some. “This is paradise. How do you transpose what you have here into town?” sympathises Chief Thomas, whose own home is on the Houma outskirts. “When you are asking people to give up what they have, it’s like death, they are dying, the community is dying.” Most importantly they will be moving away from the water that has sustained them. “They make a living out here,” notes Theo Chaisson. “What are they going to do when they get there? You think they’ll have oysters in their backyard, speckled trout, red fish, shrimp? No.”

It’s hardest for older residents, who see little attraction in giving up everything they know so late in their lives to avoid a giant storm that could come this year or may not for 10. People like Hilton Chaisson. A cousin of Theo, he raised 18 children in his modest home across from the cemetery but lost four. One drowned at the marina at just four years old. Speaking sometimes in English and sometimes in French, the first language of generations in bayou country until the latter part of the last century, he has trouble remembering his age – it seems he is 70 – but about the proposal to relocate everyone, he is quite clear.

“They will have to move me in a box. I am going to die here,” he grumbles, gesturing to the midway mark of a ground-floor window where the water got to after the last serious hurricane struck this part of the coast. He points too towards the southwest where they usually come in from. The vegetable garden he used to till out back with his grandchildren is useless now, because the saltwater has soaked the ground too often. If his neighbours are ready to uproot themselves and quit their island lives, he says, so be it. But that won’t be him and his brood. “If they want to move let them move, I don’t talk much to them people. I stay over here, I stick to my business.”

Refusing to leave is one thing, but it’s not clear if the state would maintain the island’s shaky infrastructure once the offer to relocate has been made. The mains gas line that used to run out to it under the causeway has already been shut off, though the power lines remain up. At the marina, Theo Chaisson understands he may eventually have no choice but to shut up shop. “The only problem will be if they don’t fix the road, then we are stuck out here or we’d have to get a boat to get out here. I’d just sooner close because I’m not getting in a boat to open a boat launch.”

Despite everything – the suspicion and resistance of some and the maddening number of issues still unresolved – Mr Forbes sees no alternative but to make his plan work. Letting the islanders drown isn’t an option. And, leaving aside Hilton and Theo and a few others, the response to it has been “overwhelmingly positive”, he says.

“I don’t mean for any of these complications to indicate that there is less than a full chance that we are going to make this happen. These are just things we have to figure out.”","Sat, 31 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/29/17/jeancharles.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['believe', 'forbes', 'climate', 'doesnt', 'rising', 'state', 'seas', 'island', 'change', 'americas', 'photographs', 'meet', 'chaisson', 'refugees', 'community', 'disappearing']",

The impact of which resulted in 9,503 deaths, 96 million people affected, and US$314 billion in economic damages.

The human impact of natural disasters in 2017 was much lower than the last 10 year average, where events with extremely high mortality occurred, such as the 2010 earthquake in Haiti (225,570 deaths) and the 2008 Nargis Cyclone in Myanmar (138,400 deaths).

In 2017, there was no single major event responsible for increased mortality. This is unlike more recent years where the earthquake in Nepal (2015) killed 8,831 people and Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines (2013) killed 7,354. Still both these years had a mortality below the 10 year average.

The year with the highest economic losses was 2011, at US$400 billion, mainly due to the earthquake/tsunami in Japan (a). However, 2017 is the second most costly year, reflected in the impact of three hurricanes - Harvey (US$95 billion), Irma (US$66 billion) and Maria (US$69 billion), affecting the United States and the Caribbean (cfr Cred Crunch 49).

Weather-related disasters were responsible for the majority of both human and economic losses in 2017 (B). Almost 90% of deaths in 2017 were due to climatological, hydrological or meteorological disasters.

Selling volatility and reducing credit quality don’t work because spreads are too tight and moving out on the yield curve doesn’t make sense when rates are rising. The 30-year Treasury bond, for example, is down 4% year to date.

“You have to run less risk today,” says Rieder, who spoke at a breakfast meeting with reporters. But unlike other strategists, Rieder isn’t cautious primarily because of expectations for rising inflation and consequently rising rates.

(Related: Bonds in Client Portfolios: What Advisors Need to Know)

“Inflation won’t rise that much,” says Rieder, who expects core CPI will peak at 2.5% and the core personal consumption expenditures index — the Federal Reserve’s favorite inflation gauge — slightly higher than 2%. Most job creation is occurring in the service economy, which doesn’t have the same multiplier effect as job creation in goods-producing sectors, and business spending on software tends to limit price increases, reasons Rieder.

Rather than inflation, It’s the flood of new Treasury debt to fund a $1 trillion-plus U.S. deficit that worries Rieder. The deficit is expected to explode as a result of the recent tax cut bill.

“Net issuance of Treasury debt net will be unbelievable,” says Rieder.

Given this outlook, Rieder favors two-year Treasuries, whose rates near 2.3% are well above the dividend yield of the S&P 500, at 1.87%. “You get income for two years and don’t have to take credit risk or equity risk.”

Analysing data collected since 1923, a research team examined the different factors that contributed to changes in rainfall in the Sahara region.

They found the desert, already around the size of the US, had expanded by about 10 per cent over the period covered by this data.

These results have implications for those living in the border region of the Sahara known as the Sahel, but the scientists noted that climate change-driven desertification is not a phenomenon unique to the Sahara.

""Our results are specific to the Sahara, but they likely have implications for the world's other deserts,"" said Professor Sumant Nigam, an atmospheric and oceanic scientist at the University of Maryland and the senior author of the study.

As the world’s population continues to grow, people in desert border regions cannot afford to lose more arable land to the desert.

As with any desert, the Sahara undergoes seasonal patterns of expansion and contraction, but Professor Nigam and his colleagues were able to establish the extent of its overall expansion.

In order to single out the effects of climate change, the scientists used statistical methods to remove the effects natural climate cycles such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation had on rainfall variability.

Their results revealed a combination of natural climate cycles and human-caused climate change that have caused this effect over the past century – with the latter accounting for around a third of the increase.

The study was published in the Journal of Climate.

The specially designed ‘amphibious houses’ will serve the peculiar geographic condition of the islands that are mostly inundated by water from Ashtamudi Lake. The stone laying function for the first such house was carried out by CPM politburo member S. Rama-chandra Pillai at Pooppani island in Munroe Thuruthu on Friday.

The amphibious houses will help residents overcome the constant threat of flooding in the islands. The houses will be constructed using weightless materials and will have a special design at the bottom to keep the house buoyant in the flood water. The structure of these houses has been set up on poles at a considerable height above the water level which are also immune to the high tide. The low-cost houses will also have chemical toilet facility which helps the waste disposal without harming the fragile environment of the area. The CPM has decided to construct at least one house in each local committee area.

Munroe Thuruthu has been experiencing a strange phenomenon in which several of the houses were found to be sinking in the delta which is formed by loosely constituted soil. “In Munroe Thuruthu, the issue pertains not just to the homeless alone, but the existing houses are also found to be sinking and hence inappropriate to live in. The CPM has taken up the challenge to construct light weight houses for them. The new design will not adversely affect the environment, at the same time keeping it adapted to the conditions there,” CPM district secretary K.N. Balagopal told DC. The amphibious houses are popular in countries including Japan, Vietnam, and Bangladesh where there is a constant threat of flooding.","Sat, 07 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/dc-Cover-fj73uechdvgdtbcna4m6jop8e6-20180407020926.Medi.jpeg,"['amphibious', 'water', 'houses', 'cpm', 'residents', 'threat', 'house', 'thuruthu', 'islands', 'sinking', 'munroe']",

Nitrogen is vital for plant growth, so its availability controls the amount of greenery that can exist across the planet.

The prevailing idea among scientists is that all the nitrogen used by plants comes from the air, but a new study has revealed over a quarter originates in the Earth's bedrock.

""This runs counter the centuries-long paradigm that has laid the foundation for the environmental sciences,” said Professor Ben Houlton, an environmental scientist at the University of California, Davis and co-lead author of the study.

Plant life plays a major role in shielding the world from the worst effects of climate change, as it sucks large quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and sequesters – or stores – it.

This has led many experts to call for more trees to be planted as part of global efforts to tackle climate change and meet the terms of the Paris climate agreement.

“We think that this nitrogen may allow forests and grasslands to sequester more fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions than previously thought,” said Professor Houlton.

The results of the study were published in the journal Science.

Nitrogen from rocks can enter ecosystems when rocks weather naturally, either via tectonic movements or when the rocks chemically react with rainwater.

As this previously unrecognised source could be fuelling the growth of many more plants, ecosystems around the world may be sucking more emissions from the atmosphere than past climate models have predicted.

Scientists have long observed a discrepancy between the amount of nitrogen available in the atmosphere and the amount accumulating in soil and plants.

However, until now it has not been clear how this discrepancy came about.

""We show that the paradox of nitrogen is written in stone,"" said the other co-leading author Scott Morford, a graduate student at the time of the study.

""There's enough nitrogen in the rocks, and it breaks down fast enough to explain the cases where there has been this mysterious gap.""

Recommended Warm water rapidly melting Antarctica from below due to climate change

The amount of nitrogen available from this newly discovered source varies significantly from place to place, with more weathering of nitrogen-rich rocks found at northern latitudes.

Other areas with plenty of rock nitrogen include mountainous regions like the Himalayas and Andes.

This knowledge could help guide efforts to conserve ecosystems.

""Geology might have a huge control over which systems can take up carbon dioxide and which ones don't,"" said Professor Houlton.

✕ Earth Hour: Lights turned off at Eiffel Tower and Colosseum in support of climate change awareness

""When thinking about carbon sequestration, the geology of the planet can help guide our decisions about what we're conserving.""

""These results are going to require rewriting the textbooks,"" said Kendra McLauchlan, programme director in the National Science Foundation's division of environmental biology, which co-funded the research.

""While there were hints that plants could use rock-derived nitrogen, this discovery shatters the paradigm that the ultimate source of available nitrogen is the atmosphere.”

Nitrogen is not only a crucial ingredient for life on Earth, it can also form dangerous pollutants and be used to make fertilisers essential for the world’s food supply.

“A discovery of this magnitude will open up a new era of research on this essential nutrient,” said Ms McLauchlan.","Fri, 06 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/05/15/limestone-trees-forest.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['nitrogen', 'believe', 'water', 'projections', 'climate', 'doesnt', 'massive', 'carbon', 'change', 'source', 'photographs', 'rocks', 'world', 'revolutionise', 'missing']",

A new study has used data from satellites to determine how much underwater ice is melting.

This has allowed researchers to map the retreat of the “grounding lines”, where large floating ice shelves connect to the layer of bedrock underneath Antarctica.

These shelves can be particularly vulnerable to collapse as sea water melts them from beneath.

Based on their analysis, the scientists found an area of underwater ice the size of Greater London had melted within the space of five years.

Recommended Global sea levels could rise up to five metres if Antarctic ice melts

The most alarming change was seen in West Antarctica, where over a fifth of the entire ice sheet had retreated rapidly across the sea floor – outpacing the rate of overall melting above.

""Our study provides clear evidence that retreat is happening across the ice sheet due to ocean melting at its base, and not just at the few spots that have been mapped before now,” said Dr Hannes Konrad, a researcher at the University of Leeds who led the study.

The research was published in the journal Nature Geoscience.

As the climate gets warmer, the rising sea level is one of the most significant threats facing humanity.

The number of people directly affected by such rises could run into the hundreds of millions by the end of the century, according to some estimates.

At the moment, most sea level rise is the result of thermal expansion – that is, sea water expanding as its temperature increases – and small glaciers melting.

However, as global warming continues its current trend, the contribution to sea levels made by the larger ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica is expected to increase.

Past studies have shown that the “catastrophic collapse” of major regions such as the West Antarctic ice sheet by themselves have the capacity to raise global sea levels by over 3 metres.

Understanding the different ice dynamics contributing to sea level rise is vital to build an accurate projection of life on a warmer Earth – and the shifting of the Antarctic’s grounding lines inland suggests a significant contribution coming from land-based ice melting.

The scientists found variation in rates of melting across different parts of the region, and emphasised the importance of monitoring this variation.

""These differences emphasise the complex nature of ice sheet instability across the continent, and being able to detect them helps us to pinpoint areas that deserve further investigation,” said Dr Konrad.

In particular, the scientists noted extreme underwater melting at eight of Antarctica’s biggest glaciers. The retreat of the grounding line at these glaciers was over five times the average rate of glacier melting.

Grounding lines are difficult to measure due to their location around a kilometre below sea level.

Dr Konrad and his colleagues were able to assess the position of these lines by using measures of ice sheet elevation obtained from the satellite CryoSat-2, combined with knowledge of ice sheet geometry.

""We were delighted at how well CryoSat-2 is able to detect the motion of Antarctica's grounding lines,” said Professor Andy Shepherd, one of the study’s co-authors.

“They are impossible places to access from below, and usually invisible on the ground, so it's a fantastic illustration of the value of satellite measurements for identifying and understanding environmental change.""","Mon, 02 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/02/16/antarctica-ice-sheet.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['glaciers', 'warm', 'water', 'antarctica', 'climate', 'melting', 'doesnt', 'believe', 'rapidly', 'change', 'ice', 'photographs', 'sheet', 'sea']",

As the price of clean energy technology plummets, it has become an increasingly attractive prospect for world governments.

China was by far the world’s largest investor in renewable energy in 2017, accounting for nearly half of the new infrastructure commissioned.

This was mainly a result of its massive support for solar power, which globally attracted nearly a fifth more investment than in the previous year. Other countries including Australia, Sweden and Mexico more than doubled the amount of money they pumped into clean energy projects.

“Yet again, this was a record year for new renewable power capacity being financed,” Francoise d’Estais from UN Environment’s energy and climate branch told The Independent.

“We had a record 157 gigawatts commissioned last year, far outstripping the fossil fuel generating capacity, which we estimated as 70 gigawatts.”

In just over a decade, concerted investment has increased the proportion of world electricity generated by wind, solar and other renewable sources from around 5 per cent to 12 per cent.

The global replacement of traditional fuels with renewables led to around 1.8 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions being avoided last year – the equivalent of removing the entire US transport system.

“The extraordinary surge in solar investment around the world shows how much can be achieved when we commit to growth without harming the environment,” said the head of UN Environment, Erik Solheim.

“By investing in renewables, countries can power new communities, improving the lives and livelihoods of the people who live in them, and at the same time cleaning up the air they breathe.”

As China’s electricity demands have risen rapidly, renewable energy has become an increasingly appealing prospect that has the added benefit of avoiding the toxic air pollution blighting many of the nation’s major cities.

“A dominant trend over the last couple of years has been the falling cost of renewables – wind but particularly also solar – and that has been important for China,” Professor Ulf Moslener, a sustainable energy expert at Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, told The Independent.

“In China there has also been a strong government push for increasing solar, and that was motivated not only by climate but also other environmental reasons.”

Recommended Wind and solar overtake nuclear as source of UK electricity

Besides revealing the leading lights in renewable energy investment, the report, commissioned by the UN in cooperation with Bloomberg New Energy Finance, also revealed that some major countries were falling behind.

“The growth globally in terms of investment hides the fact that there is strong growth in China, a slight decline in the US, and a considerably strong fall in investment in Europe – and that is strongly driven by Germany and the UK,” said Professor Moslener.

The UK has been performing well in clean energy generation, with recent figures showing wind and solar sources had overtaken nuclear as suppliers of electricity.

However, despite these positive trends, 2017 saw a big drop of 65 per cent in British renewables investment.

This is partly due to the timing of large projects being financed – there were several major offshore wind projects funded in 2016 and only one in 2017 – but here has also been a decline in government support.

“The government stopped offering subsidy support for onshore wind after the 2015 election,” Angus McCrone, the lead author of the report, told The Independent.

“For solar there was a big cutback in support as well.”

Experts have criticised the withdrawal of UK support for onshore wind, as previous analysis has demonstrated it already has the capacity to outcompete fossil fuels as a power source.

As renewable energy prices continue to fall, however, Professor Moslener said government subsidies are likely to become less and less important.

While the figures in the new report are encouraging from a global perspective, experts warned that there was still plenty of progress to be made.

“The world added more solar capacity than coal, gas and nuclear plants combined,” said Nils Stieglitz, president of the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, which helped produce the report.

“This shows where we are heading, although the fact that renewables altogether are still far from providing the majority of electricity means that we still have a long way to go.”","Thu, 05 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/05/11/china-solar-power.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['believe', 'solar', 'climate', 'doesnt', 'gas', 'change', 'combined', 'wind', 'photographs', 'report', 'coal', 'nuclear', 'invested', 'energy', 'investment', 'world', 'reveals']",

Renewables’ share of electricity generation shot up to 29 per cent, while nuclear sources accounted for around 21 per cent.

The increase means low carbon energy sources – which include both renewables and nuclear – now account for over half of all electricity generated.

Wind had a particularly good year, giving weight to renewable energy leaders who are calling on the government to end its ban on wind-power subsidies.

Recommended Transport becomes most polluting UK sector as emissions drop overall

“These official figures confirm that it’s been another record-breaking year for wind energy, which generated 15 per cent of the UK’s electricity in 2017,” said Emma Pinchbeck, executive director of trade body RenewableUK.

“The move to a smart, renewables-led energy system is well underway.”

The figures published by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy showed renewable energy generation was up nearly a fifth due to increased capacity and higher wind speeds.

Greenhouse gas emissions also fell by 3 per cent across the country, thanks largely to a drop in coal use.

Output from renewable energy sources is now nearly 10 times higher than coal, a notable achievement considering coal’s output was the higher of the two only five years ago.

“The plunging price of renewables is allowing low carbon energy to replace coal and gas,” said Nina Schrank, energy campaigner for Greenpeace UK.

“This meant that at the end of last year over half of our electricity came from low carbon sources, and most of that from wind and solar, overtaking nuclear power.

“These fast-moving trends will continue into the next decade as a new generation of offshore wind turbines come online and demonstrate the technology’s ability to provide the bulk of UK demand.”

Technological improvements in recent years have led to a dramatic fall in the cost of renewable energy.

Previous analysis by the International Renewable Energy Agency has demonstrated that onshore wind farms in particular already have the capacity to outcompete fossil fuels.

Experts have called for an end to the government’s current subsidy ban on new onshore wind farms, which they say is holding back the development of the UK’s energy infrastructure.

“The cost of new offshore wind halved in 2017 and onshore wind is already the cheapest of any new power source in the UK,” said Ms Pinchbeck.

“So it’s vital that new onshore wind should be allowed to compete in the market for the sake of consumers.”

Though many environmentalists and scientists see nuclear as a vital component in a green energy system, plans by the government to invest in new nuclear infrastructure have been met with criticism.

Specifically, campaigners have taken issue with the investment in new nuclear facilities instead of large scale wind and solar projects.

“These figures show the government should capitalise on our global lead in this area and stop wasting time and money propping up nuclear power, a failing and increasingly obsolete technology,” said Ms Pinchbeck.","Fri, 30 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/30/14/wind-power-sunlight.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['believe', 'overtake', 'solar', 'climate', 'doesnt', 'change', 'wind', 'source', 'photographs', 'nuclear', 'energy', 'renewable', 'sources', 'uk', 'electricity']",

However, there are no recorded incidents of Danes turning away Jewish refugees, and it is not equitable to fault a country a bit larger than Maryland for not being proactive in accepting Jewish refugees.

Still, the point is well-made: Jews were largely alone, so we swore “never again” would we allow something like the Holocaust to occur.

Never again also meant that no people should face atrocities while others allow it to happen. Rwanda, Sri Lanka, Biafra, and elsewhere testify to less success on that issue.

We can and must do better.

Today, Bangladeshi Hindus are alone as they face extinction. Pakistan’s 1951 census counted Hindus as almost a third of East Pakistan’s population. When East Pakistan became Bangladesh in 1971, they were under a fifth of the population. Thirty years later, they were less than a tenth. Today’s estimates are about one in 15.

A continuous flood of verified, targeted atrocities have driven that population decline. My book, A Quiet Case of Ethnic Cleansing: The Murder of Bangladesh’s Hindus, documents many of them. The Bangladeshi government is not carrying out these atrocities, but it lets them proceed with impunity. It lets the criminals escape prosecution and even profits from their crimes.

On a just-concluded trip to Bangladesh, I observed these conditions firsthand. Working with human rights attorney Rabindra Ghosh, I saw remnants of destroyed Hindu temples, Hindu properties occupied by Muslims, and heard testimony from witnesses testifying to assaults, gang rape, and murder.

In the capital of Dhaka we toured a Hindu home shortly after it was ransacked and looted. The attack lasted four and a half hours in broad daylight, with no police intervention. We confronted police and secured armed protection for the family, but the promised arrests nabbed only minor participants. The better-connected culprits got away without any sanction.

That same day, we received a call from a Hindu temple. It was under siege by angry Muslims, who claimed the land for themselves and threatened to seize it. Attempts by Hindu religious leaders to get police protection were in vain, and the police officer in charge was refusing to take their calls. We confronted him, got the armed guards, but wondered why it took our intervention.

In my fight against this oppression, I’ve interviewed hundreds of Hindu gang rape victims, families whose children were abducted and forced to convert to Islam, and survivors of attacks. I’ve seen charred remnants of homes, religious desecration, and an entire village attacked. My “baptism by fire” occurred in 2009, when I interviewed a 14-year-old girl who said that she was chased down and raped by Muslim neighbors who seized her family’s land.

With Bangladeshi elections scheduled for the end of 2018, things will get even worse for Hindus there. Targeted anti-Hindu violence always accompanies Bangladeshi elections. We know it will happen, and we have eight months to prepare — to let Bangladeshi Hindus know they are not alone.

While I believe that the Bangladeshi government and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina want all citizens to practice their faith in peace and security, the reality is otherwise. Even police officials are getting frustrated. One lamented that they are dealing with the same challenges that their predecessors faced; and they know that their successors will face them, too.

If we are not to be like those who sat idly by while their Jewish neighbors were dragged away in the night, we must act. We must tell our US senators and members of Congress that lives are hanging in the balance, and the victims are looking to the United States for help.

We have leverage. Bangladesh’s economy needs us to buy its garments and fund UN Peacekeeping missions. Or perhaps those peacekeepers should be returned to Bangladesh to prevent these atrocities if the government will not.

On March 25, Rabindra Ghosh, human rights giant and president of the Bangladesh Minority Watch, became the latest victim of anti-Hindu violence. His home was broken into and looted. Police action has been anemic at best, and Mr. Ghosh and others are fearful of more attacks. Even appeals to government ministers have failed to move them to action.

Ghosh said that the attackers wanted to intimidate him into abandoning his human rights work. It is not the first time that he and his family have been attacked, and he believes that it will not be the last. Still, he told me, it will not change what he does. With anti-Hindu atrocities on the uptick, he has been true to his word.

Cyclone Debbie hit the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales from March 28, 2017 until the early part of April.

This fourth and final loss estimate is level with the third loss estimate, which was was issued by PERILS on 28 September 2017, six months after the event.

This is the first Australian catastrophe event for which a market loss footprint, based on loss data collected from affected insurance companies, is available at a postcode level and by property line of business, said PERILS.

In addition, the data has been divided between those losses classified as “cyclone” and those classified as “flood.” The combination of loss information with PERILS market sums insured allows users to derive damage degree functions as a percentage of total sums insured (TSI) for both cyclone and flood, PERILS continued.

As already available in the third loss report, the loss footprint information is complemented by postcode-level gust-speed values sourced from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and Risk Frontiers, and by postcode-level rain intensity measures provided by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM). This allows subscribers to validate vulnerability functions in probabilistic Cat models with actual, high-quality, independent market data, among other uses.

“This final footprint for Debbie has again been produced by collecting detailed loss data from affected insurance companies,” commented Darryl Pidcock, head of PERILS Asia-Pacific.

“The coverage and quality of this information has enabled us to create an accurate loss picture for what was a complex storm, impacting a wide area with flood and wind, and resulting in materially different impacts over the affected areas. This real data also enables subscribers to validate their model assumptions,” he added.

“The preparation of this data requires considerable effort on the part of the data-providing companies. We are extremely grateful for their continued support and remain committed to returning value in the form of high-quality industry data which helps them to manage their exposure to Australian cat risk,” Pidcock went on to say.

37,37,FL-2018-000105-BGD,Philippines: Disaster Management Reference Handbook (March 2018) - Philippines - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/philippines-disaster-management-reference-handbook-march-2018,"Executive Summary

The Philippines has a high vulnerability to natural hazards which are attributed to the nation’s geographic position in Southeast Asia. Natural disasters such as typhoons, earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and fires affect the country. Volcanic eruptions and tsunamis are related to the continental plate activity around “the Ring of Fire”. Because it is one of the most geologically active areas, it is nicknamed “The Ring of Fire”. This is a circular arm of active volcanoes that surrounds the Pacific Ocean basin. This area in the Pacific Ocean covers nearly 25,000 miles from the southern tip of South America, to the west coast of North America, across the Bering Strait, through Japan, and into New Zealand. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan (also known as Typhoon Yolanda), one of the deadliest disasters to strike the Philippines, affected 26 million people and claimed at least 8,000 lives. Rising sea levels are also a direct threat to approximately 70 percent of the Philippine population, which has forced many to relocate as a result. In addition, climate change has also increased the severity and frequency of natural disasters in the country.

The agricultural tradition and rapid development in some areas of the country leave large portions of the population and the economy vulnerable to natural hazards. Apart from the metropolitan regions, the agricultural workers and fishermen are the most affected population by natural disasters. Approximately one-third of the Philippines total population are employed in the agriculture sector and natural disasters pose significant threats to this population’s food security and sources of income.

The Philippine Government, International Non-government Organizations (INGOs) and local NGOs are all making attempts to address the impact of disasters and climate change at various levels. The Philippine Government has made significant strides in the implementation of disaster risk reduction (DRR) planning and activities through the development of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) which acts as the lead agency for DRR in the Philippines. The disaster focal points are the NDRRMC and the Office of Civil Defence (OCD). The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) is responsible for leading immediate disaster relief efforts.

The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is a primary responder in disasters and have been deployed frequently to several disaster relief operations in the country in recent years. The Philippines has endured disasters that involve national and international assistance.

There is increased awareness on disaster risk reduction in the Philippines, but proper integration with climate change adaptation and sustainable development policies can be improved. Disaster risk reduction management and climate change adaptation have been integrated in various plans and framework; however, multiple plans can be overwhelming for local government units. The Philippine Government has learned from Typhoon Haiyan that risk communication is essential and through the NDRRMC has issued very specific warnings regarding potential storm impacts as a result.","Fri, 30 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1069114-Philippines_2018-0318.png?itok=K4BErkNf,"['development', 'population', 'climate', 'natural', 'disaster', 'handbook', 'reference', 'change', 'reduction', 'philippines', 'disasters', '2018', 'management', 'risk']", 
38,38,FL-2018-000105-BGD,Bangladesh's rice import volume to drop by one-fourth - Dhaka Tribune,https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/agriculture/2018/04/10/bangladeshs-rice-import-volume-drop-one-fourth,"After a bad crop year Bangladesh appears to be bouncing back with prospects of a good rice output this year. The country's dependency on rice import is expected to drastically reduce by a fourth from a record import of the staple – 3.6 million metric tons (MT) in 2017-18 marketing year (MY) to just eight lakh MT in 2018-19 MY. According to a just-released grain report by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Bangladesh's total rice production is forecast to increase to 34.7 million MT in 2018-19 MY (in May-April) from the 32.6 million MT produced in 2017-18 MY. USDA largely attributed a higher Boro production for this year-on-year output surge. Last year rice production fell due to a devastating haor flashflood and rice blast attacks. In 2018-19 MY, which begins with the harvesting of Boro, the production of rice is forecast to exceed the government's target, stated the USDA report, as farmers increased cultivation areas with an expectation of good prices, and to recoup the Boro and Aman production losses from the previous year. ""Farmers have switched to Boro rice from wheat and potato cultivation as they attempt to avoid loss from wheat blast and the lower price of potato. The government’s procurement price of Boro and Aman paddy [unhusked] and rice [milled] of last year offers an opportunity to get good prices for this season's Boro rice,"" said USDA. However, USDA noted, farmers' expectation of a higher price may be dampened if production is higher as expected and imports continue to follow the pace of the last few months. ""As highly fluctuating husked rice price is mostly controlled by millers, past experience indicates that millers manage to keep the paddy purchase price lower through imports of more rice [husked] before the harvest season."" USDA estimated that rice imports will fall to 0.8 million MT in 2018-19 MY, comparing it to an estimated 3.6 million MT in 2017-18 MY, due to higher domestic production backed by favourable weather conditions. The rice import estimate is revised upward to 3.6 million MT in 2017-18 MY due to increased imports to fill the supply shortfall caused by the previous year's devastating flood and the application of a 2% import tariff. According to the Ministry of Food, from July, 2017 to March, 2018, total rice imports were a little over 3.5 million MT. Of these, over 0.95 million MT has been imported by the government while the rest by private traders. This is the highest ever rice import in Bangladesh while the previous highest record stood at 3 million MT during the 1998-99 financial year. Around 67% of Bangladesh's cultivated land area is used for rice production. A study by the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) reported that in the period 1990-91 to 2016-17, adoption of modern varieties (MV) increased area by 11% in Boro, 246% in Aus and 135% in Aman season rice. Although government has a long term plan to reduce Boro rice area and increase Aus and Aman rice production, the yield of Boro rice is still dominant in producing 54% higher yield than Aus and 40% higher than Aman.","Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2017/07/Web_Rice_import.jpg,"['drop', 'million', 'volume', 'price', 'usda', 'higher', 'bangladeshs', 'onefourth', 'boro', 'rice', 'import', 'mt', 'imports', 'production']",

The forest land lies to the west of the existing Kutupalong camps in Ukhiya of Teknaf. Previously 3,000 acres, and later 2,800 acres of land had already been allocated for the Rohingyas. District Commissioner of Cox's Bazar Md Kamal Hossain has confirmed that the risk-prone Rohingya camps will be evicted and the Rohingyas will be relocated in the newly allocated lands within a few days. Kamal Hossain said: ""We have identified 200,000 Rohingyas as being directly subject to flood, landslide, cyclone and tidal waves in the coming monsoon. ""RRRC, UNHCR, UNDP, and other organizations are jointly working to relocate these 200,000 Rohingyas to safer zones,"" said Kamal. The district commissioner further said that the risky areas have been marked with red flags. ""UNDP, UNHCR and other aid organizations have already started leveling the hilly grounds of the newly allocated land,"" continued the district commissioner. ""Soon the Rohingyas will be moved."" Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner Md Abdul Kalam said: ""Initiatives have been taken to move the Rohingyas at the end of April. Already, 15,000 Rohingyas have been relocated. ""Other than that, 100,000 Rohingyas will be sent to Bhashan Char,"" Abdul said. ""There, the Bangladesh Navy has already started building houses and cyclone shelters following a specific model."" On the other hand, several Rohingya refugees from Kutupalong camp have expressed their fears of living in hilly areas because of soft, unstable grounds. Ever since August 24 last year, more than 1 million Rohingyas have been living in the hilly portions of Ukhiya-Teknaf after being forced out of Myanmar by the Myanmar military and radical Moghs. Currently, Rohingyas are staying in 12 camps, most of which have been built by cutting hills. This makes the residences of almost 200,000 Rohingyas extremely vulnerable to landslides. If these refugees are not relocated to a safe zone soon, many will fall victim to the coming inclement weather, and its impact will be felt throughout the country.","Sat, 07 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2015/01/kutupalong_rohingya_DT_14.1.18.gif,"['allocated', 'rohingyas', 'relocated', 'hilly', 'living', 'commissioner', 'kamal', 'acres', 'teknaf', 'land', 'refugees', '540', 'rohingya']",

Last year’s natural catastrophe activity set a record for the highest insured losses ever at $144bn, according to Swiss Re’s latest Sigma study.

American weather events led the loss sheet.

Hurricanes Harvey (pictured), Irma and Maria (HIM) together resulted in insured losses of some $92bn to the US and Caribbean.

Last year’s natural catastrophe activity set a record for the highest insured losses ever at $144bn, according to Europan reinsurer Swiss Re’s latest Sigma study.

HIM’s toll was equal to 0.5% of the entire US GDP last year, Swiss Re said, making 2017 the second costliest North Atlantic hurricane season since 2005 – the year of Katrina.

The economic cost of the three hurricanes taken together was estimated at $217bn by Swiss Re.

Harvey and Irma each cost the insurance sector some $30bn, Maria added on $32bn, giving the $92bn combined HIM bill.

“After 12 years of no major hurricane making US landfall, 2017 is likely to go down as one of the most expensive North Atlantic hurricane seasons in history, in terms of both economic and insured losses,” said Martin Bertogg, Swiss Re’s head of catastrophe perils.

Global economic losses from natural disasters and man-made catastrophes were reached $337bn in 2017, the reinsurer reported.

Continuing the reinsurer’s “protection gap” narrative, Swiss Re noted a “worldwide catastrophe protection gap of $193bn” between the insured and economic loss figures.

The economic cost of big disaster events was almost double 2016’s figure, and the second highest on record.

The reinsurer also tallied the human cost of 2017’s disastrous events.

More than 11,000 people lost their lives or went missing in disaster events last year, with 8,000 of those falling victim to natural catastrophes.

A landslide and floods in Sierra Leone in mid-August took most lives, with 1,141 people declared dead or missing, Swiss Re reported.

Elsewhere, heavy monsoon rains and separate flood events led to more than 1,000 deaths across India, Nepal and Bangladesh, the reinsurer added.

Asia’s biggest economic loss to natural catastrophe was in China, but low insurance penetration muted insured losses.

“Elsewhere, in China heavy rains caused the Yangtze River to flood, with pluvial and river flooding across 11 provinces inundating more than over 400,000 homes,” Swiss Re reported.

“The economic losses were estimated to be $6bn, making it the costliest loss disaster event in 2017 in Asia,” the reinsurer continued.

Wildfires reached another insurance loss record, costing the sector $14bn in claims costs in 2017, the highest ever in a single year, according to Swiss Re.

In October and December 2017, separate wildfire outbreaks led to record losses of $13bn across northern and southern California.

The Tubbs fire in the Sonoma and Napa counties caused $7.7bn in insured losses, making it the world’s costliest wildfire ever in terms of insured losses, Swiss Re noted.

There were also major wildfires in Europe and Canada last year.

“In Portugal, high temperatures and strong winds provided the fuel for uncontrollable forest fires. The number of hectares burned from the beginning of the year through to the end October was 53 times more than the annual average of the previous 10 years,” the Sigma study.","Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://d17mj6xr9uykrr.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/2/3/5/60235_iStock-841445032-Hurricane-Harvey.jpg,"['highest', 'natural', 'economic', 'insured', 'loss', 'swiss', 'losses', '2017', 'reinsurer', 'record', 'catastrophe']",

44,44,FL-2018-000105-BGD,What the gig economy can learn from the mistakes of microfinance - Quartz,https://qz.com/work/1247877/what-the-gig-economy-can-learn-from-the-mistakes-of-microfinance/,"Fifteen years ago, I was often told I took the fun out of financial innovation. At the time, microfinance (the provision of small-scale loans and savings products to the economically active poor around the world) was in the early stages of commercialization. Many colleagues, bankers and the general public pooh-poohed the concept, viewing it either as merely a rebranded form of charity or a passing fancy that might get a few eclectic investors but unlikely more than that.

I was an analyst and, later, legal counsel to microfinance institutions (MFIs), investors, and governments in developing countries. My focus on the public policy needs and ramifications of what were effectively new financial services for the world’s unbanked was often seen as a wonky reality check on an otherwise half-baked idea.

Then, in November 2007, Muhammad Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize for his pioneering work with Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Almost overnight, microfinance heated up, and unprecedented amounts of capital began flowing into MFIs from India to Kenya, Peru, Bosnia and beyond. Investors began to see the economically active poor as bankable, and the power not only to alleviate poverty, but also to empower women (who represent the majority of microfinance clients) and develop emerging economies. They could return a healthy profit and social return as well. When the global financial crisis of 2008 struck, MFIs were largely unscathed, because their success was not tied to synthetic derivatives in London or Hong Kong, but rather hard-working, entrepreneurial individuals striving daily to build good businesses and provide for their families.

MFIs were the darlings of the day. Investors could not get enough of their “impact investment” promise, and before long, capital flows became a flood. MFIs who previously had struggled for growth capital found the new funding irresistible and began loosening their lending criteria and due diligence. Interest rates went from high (which is not inherently bad, so long as rates are appropriately risk-adjusted) to usurious. Loans were made to individuals who lacked financial (and sometimes foundational) literacy, so even a duty or promise to inform was often impossible to fulfill in reality. In many cases there was no effective legal or policy regime to regulate MFIs or protect customers; the rules were outdated, poorly enforced, and failed to account for the role of social capital within MFIs’ communities. Much of the industry that began as an act of generosity, enforced by group social norms, became a payday loan operation to consumers.

What happened next should come as no surprise. As MFIs made more loans while paying lip service to their broader responsibilities, more clients became unable to repay. Those clients faced enormous pressure and had limited alternatives to respond. We saw rashes of MFI client suicides and, periodically, a massive exodus when it became clear an MFI had put financial profits before social mission. High-profile MFIs that went public during this time, including SKS Microfinance in India and Compartamos in Mexico, saw their share prices sink and came under intense public scrutiny.

What the gig economy can learn from microfinance

Five years later, as I began venturing into the (then very nascent) sharing economy—another much buzzed-about economic system—I couldn’t help but draw parallels to what I had experienced in microfinance.

Back then, the sharing economy was a term that usually caused people’s eyes to glaze over. “Oh, you mean like hippies?” “I would never share my car or home with someone; that’s creepy.” “Ownership is the American Dream!”

Needless to say, these skeptics have been soundly disproven through the meteoric growth of sharing economy platforms since then: Airbnb now hosts over one million people every week, bikesharing is the fastest growing form of transportation in the world, and it’s now possible to share everything from desks to dogs, clothing, and kitchen utensils.

We’ve also seen the emergence of a bewildering array of new terms to describe what’s going on: the collaborative economy, on-demand economy, peer production (and a non-trivial amount of “sharewashing.”) Perhaps no term has come to be more popular, or loaded, as the gig economy, which refers to the array of online platforms that now connect freelancers for work that is often short-term or temporary in nature (gigs). Not only is this version of the sharing economy increasingly defining new opportunities for income generation and flexible work; it also is revealing a series of blind spots and spurring debate—not unlike microfinance years ago.

There is no doubt that sharing presents distinct advantages over ownership, and flexible work arrangements are often preferable to fixed schedules. The reasons that people flock to these platforms are many: saving money, earning income in new ways, using resources more efficiently, and—ideally—building stronger community, relationships and social fabric. But just as with microfinance, these upsides are not guaranteed, nor do they exist in a vacuum. We have to look at the bigger picture and unexpected ripple effects.

When a driver who had seen his livelihood nearly decimated in recent years killed himself in front of New York City’s city hall last month, I stopped in my tracks. It was as though I was watching a rerun of a movie I’d watched many times before, albeit on the other side of the earth and within entirely different cultures.

The driver, Doug Schifter, blamed “structural cruelties,” politicians and new policy measures for his dire situation. With no hope and no solution in sight, he wished to bring the challenges of many others like him to the public conscience.

The set of dynamics faced by Mr. Schifter are remarkably similar to those at play in microfinance, when clients began committing suicide rather than face the penalties of loan default. Finally MFIs, investors and policy makers began to see the long-term devastation that lack of appropriate regulations could inflict upon society, and they began to make changes.

Worldwide, we saw new rules addressing financial literacy, transparency of loan terms, national credit and loan registries established to protect against over-indebtedness, and private sector initiatives such as the Smart Campaign and CGAP’s Financial Capability program. These efforts did not solve the problem overnight, but they represented a key first step. They helped clients to make informed decisions about whether to take on a loan, develop repayment (and contingency) plans in advance, and ultimately contribute far more to local economic development.

How the gig economy can mitigate its downsides

It is time for platforms and policy makers to take similar steps, both to ensure healthy, responsible economic growth and to mitigate potential downsides. Both carrots and sticks can be effective. A robust foundation for this includes:

Planning and strategy for more challenges ahead: ​Small loans were but the beginning of microfinance; later, the advent of mobile banking was even more disruptive, as developing countries leapfrogged brick-and-mortar banks altogether. The gig economy today in some ways sidesteps social safety nets and protections that workers have taken for granted for decades. The trillion-dollar question is how to update policies, systems and norms for a 21st century workforce.

Moving forward, we must pay equal attention to the dynamics of “new economy” business models and their potential blind spots. In particular, flexible platforms for income generation can be incredibly helpful, even transformational, but they must be harnessed responsibly and with appropriate rules—and an eye towards the public good—in place.

Shortly before he took his life, Mr. Schifter said in a Facebook post, “The clues are all about you if you take the time to seek them.” Microfinance today is in a much better, more sustainable (and profitable!) place than it was ten years ago, thanks to a concerted effort by private, public and social sector stakeholders. Now it’s the gig economy’s turn to rise to the occasion. The clues—and solutions—are all around us.","Mon, 09 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/rtsscsf1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['platforms', 'microfinance', 'sharing', 'mistakes', 'began', 'gig', 'social', 'mfis', 'learn', 'economy', 'public', 'policy', 'financial']", 
45,45,FL-2018-000105-BGD,Meet the river people: who speaks for the rivers? - Stuff.co.nz,https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/102741097/meet-the-river-people-who-speaks-for-the-rivers,"OPINION: Last March, the New Zealand Parliament passed ground-breaking legislation declaring that the Whanganui River catchment (Te Awa Tupua) has ""all the rights, powers, duties and liabilities of a legal person"", as part of a political settlement with Māori.

Days later, in India, the Uttarakhand High Court ruled that the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers, sacred in the Hindu religion, have the same legal rights as a person. These cases received widespread media attention, but less well-known is the recent landmark decision of the Constitutional Court of Colombia, which found that the Atrato River catchment is an ""entidad sujeto de derechos"" (legal person), as a consequence of cultural connections and rights of river-dependent Indigenous and Afro-descendent communities (adopting an ecocentric perspective and theory of biocultural rights).

Interest in this novel approach to river protection appears to be building momentum, and new river guardians have just been announced in both New Zealand and Colombia. But what does it mean to give legal rights to rivers? And how will these new guardians speak for their river?

Murray Wilson/ Fairfax NZ. Flooding in Whanganui. If the Whanganui River is ""legal person"", does that mean it couold be sued for flood damage?

A watershed moment?

Giving a river legal personality means that rivers are the subject of legal rights, and can go to court, enter into contracts, and hold property in their own name. In the New Zealand, Indian and Colombian cases, the granting of legal rights to the river is an imaginative legal and political solution to a major environmental problem, upending the traditional approach to water resource management, which assumes that water resources should be managed primarily for human benefit.

DAVID UNWIN/FAIRFAX NZ Multiple personalities: Low cloud rolls into the hills in the Whanganui National park on Whanganui River Road.

Each of the four rivers are threatened by over-exploitation, pollution and cultural desecration. The Whanganui River has been degraded, including being quarried for gravel and diverted for hydroelectric development, since British colonisation. The Ganges and Yamuna Rivers have been extensively polluted by industry, urbanisation and agriculture. The Atrato River has been devastated by illegal mining; destroying the natural course of the river, inundating the rainforest, and contaminating the river with chemicals in what the Constitutional Court describes as a grave humanitarian and environmental crisis.

Declaring rivers legal persons, with the rights that entails, gives the rivers the ability to protect themselves, and broadens water resource management objectives to include protecting rivers as an end in itself.

In each case, giving the rivers legal rights also recognises the interests of local communities who live alongside and advocate for the river. These communities are deeply concerned about the state of their river, and feel a strong obligation to protect and restore its physical and metaphysical qualities. In contrast to the Western, utilitarian view of a river as a resource to be exploited by humans, the communities claim distinct relationships with the river based on guardianship, symbiosis and respect, in which the rivers have an intrinsic right to exist. That is the core-concept of biocultural rights.

In New Zealand, the distinct relationship of the Whanganui iwi and the river emerges from tikanga Māori (Māori law), which positions humans and nature as intrinsically interconnected and interdependent, manifest in their tribal idiom, ""I am the river, and the river is me"".

Who speaks for the rivers?

Each river will be represented by nominated legal guardians, who will speak and act in (and if necessary, fight for) the river's best interests. The Whanganui River will be represented by Te Pou Tupua, an entity comprised of one representative nominated by the Crown and one by the Whanganui iwi.

In all three countries, governments are responsible for the appointment of guardians and the creation of new institutions and organisations to give effect to the new legal status of the rivers, but the reaction from governments has varied greatly.

In New Zealand, the government has committed new funding, and, in September 2017, two representatives, both Māori with links to the Whanganui, were appointed to Te Pou Tupua, to act as the ""human face"" of the river. In the same week, in Colombia, the river communities have appointed 14 guardians to act on behalf of the Atrato River, with the Ministry for Environment nominated as the President's representative.

However, in India, the court-appointed guardians have been reluctant to assume their new responsibilities. The state government has appealed the decision of the High Court to the Supreme Court of India, arguing that it is unclear how far their responsibilities for the rivers extend, particularly as the Ganges River eventually flows into Bangladesh. The state government also argued that acting in loco parentis could make the guardians responsible for the actions of the rivers, and that the guardians could be held liable for damages caused by future flood events. The Supreme Court has stayed the effect of the original ruling while it reaches a decision on the appeal, leaving the current status of the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers unclear.

A cultural shift

Many questions remain about the practical impact of the legal person approach. However, aside from any direct legal consequences, including the ability of the river to take to the courts to protect its interests in its own name, the recognition of a river as a ""person"" produces a profound cultural shift in the way we think about, and interact with, rivers. As a legal person, the river is now viewed as an interconnected, living entity rather than a collection of separate legal parts (or even rights), and the condition and health of the river is respected as an end in of itself. However, giving rivers legal rights also increases the willingness of people to hold the rivers, or their guardians, legally liable for damage like flooding – and people are already asking: can we sue the river?

Despite this, the new legal status of rivers is cause for optimism: in an increasingly competitive and degraded world, legal personality may offer a new way to protect the environment for itself and for present and future generations. Where existing laws and institutions have failed us, we owe it to nature to give legal personality a try.

She made the call when Regional Director of WHO-SEARO Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh met her at the PM’s official residence, Ganobhaban, on Wednesday. Prime Minister's Press Secretary Ihsanul Karim briefed reporters after the meeting. The Prime Minister informed the WHO Regional Director that Bangladesh has given shelter to Rohingyas on humanitarian grounds. She said the Bangladesh government has completed the biometric registration of the Myanmar's displaced nationals who have entered Bangladesh facing atrocities unleashed by the Myanmar forces in Rakhine state. Sheikh Hasina said the government has given identity cards to Rohingyas so that they could be identified easily and the Myanmar government could take them back. She said some 28,000 people are working round the clock to manage more than 1,000,000 Rohingyas. Dr Khetrapal Singh highly appreciated Bangladesh government's move over the Rohingya issue. ""The Bangladesh government is doing a great job,"" she said. She also mentioned that the WHO will help Bangladesh provide immunization and medical services to the Rohingyas. Dr. Khetrapal Singh expressed concern that health conditions, sanitation and waterborne diseases of the Rohingyas would only exacerbate during the upcoming monsoon season, and urged the government to continue its immunization activities. She said that the huge number of Rohingya refugees, which is more than the total population of Bhutan, is the main problem to manage. ""This is a gigantic job,"" she added. Hasina said her government is in touch with five neighbouring countries bordering with Myanmar, including Thailand, China and India, on the issue of the Rohingya crisis.

By Nellie Peyton

SAINT-LOUIS, Senegal, April 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - "" Mum, mum, get up - the water's here!""

Fatou Ndiaye's children shook her awake in the night, as waves crashed against their house on the coast of Saint-Louis, a city in northern Senegal.

They were used to sleeping with the sound of the ocean a few feet away - but this time Ndiaye stretched out her hand and felt water rising inside the room. They fled.

Two weeks later, she told the story standing by a pile of rubble where her childhood home used to be.

The disaster surprised no one in this crowded fishing neighbourhood. Since 2016, two or three times a year, the ocean has swelled and knocked another row of houses off the coast.

Saint-Louis, a city that spans a thin peninsula between the Senegal River and the Atlantic Ocean, is particularly vulnerable to the rising sea levels and urban crowding that are putting pressure on West Africa's coast.

With damage now unavoidable, Senegal's government and the World Bank are mobilising to resettle nearly 10,000 people from the city's riskiest zone.

The effort reveals the challenges other countries will also face as their shorelines retreat due to a combination of higher seas linked to global warming and coastal erosion driven by natural processes and manmade factors, such as poorly planned infrastructure and sand mining.

In Saint-Louis' dirt streets, crisscrossed with laundry lines and filled with sheep, residents described their predicament.

""They took people to Khar Yalla, but Khar Yalla is not good,"" said Ndiaye, referring to a temporary relocation site about 6 km (4 miles) inland that now houses about 1,000 people.

Not wanting to go to a place where most people are living in tents without electricity or running water, she instead moved in with neighbours whose house was still standing - but could be the next to go.

Other residents near the water's edge said they were afraid and ready to leave, but had not received help.

""For two years now, the water has been rising. It doesn't recede,"" said Soda Mbengue, eight months pregnant, walking through her shell of a home.

""The government told us they'd come here to help us, and give us houses, but up until today we've seen nothing,"" she said. Water seeps into her bedroom all the time.

FISHERMEN COMMUTE

Tourists still stroll through art galleries in the centre of Saint-Louis, the former French capital of colonial West Africa, but it is in the poor neighbourhoods, just across a short bridge, that buildings are disappearing into the ocean.

A school and a large mosque have already succumbed to the waves, with pupils redistributed to other packed classrooms.

Khalifa Faye, 21, was among the first to lose his home to a storm, two years ago. After living in a tent for a few months, he and his family were given a small concrete house at the relocation site in Khar Yalla.

""In the beginning it was bad. We didn't know this place,"" said Faye, standing in a yard where his aunts made couscous and children played. Now he is happy, he said, though he wishes they had plumbing.

But other residents, especially those newly displaced, were less content. The temporary settlement sits on the side of a highway, surrounded by barren fields.

Tauty Fall lifted the flap of a blue canvas tent to reveal a small space where she lives with her husband, their five children, and another family. ""Life is not good here,"" she said.

Almost all the men earn a living from fishing and must now commute to the sea, said their wives. They take a bus for 150 CFA francs ($0.30) but in the off-hours they have to take expensive taxis.

Deputy Mayor Balla Gueye said the people shifted to Khar Yalla are living in ""precarious, very difficult conditions"". The city is working to provide them with better temporary lodging, such as mobile homes, before the permanent relocation scheme gets underway, he added.

In the meantime, the government is ordering more tents.

Another 59 families lost their homes in the most recent storm at the end of February, and some don't even have a canvas roof yet, Gueye said.

WEST AFRICA FUNDING

The World Bank project in Saint-Louis aims to relocate about 10,000 people at a cost of $30 million. It covers residents within 20 metres of the waterline on a 3.5 km stretch of shore, said the deputy mayor.

But erosion threatens thousands of kilometres of coast from Mauritania to Gabon. About 105 million people live in West Africa's coastal areas, which generate 56 percent of the region's gross domestic product, according to the World Bank.

In some places, the land is receding as much as 10 metres a year, it said.

To deal with the larger problem, the bank has launched a West Africa Coastal Areas Management Program (WACA), with a first funding round of about $220 million due to be approved this month.

The money will be used to build sea walls and other defences, plant vegetation along shores and support communities, said Benoit Bosquet, WACA manager at the World Bank. But it will not be enough to move everyone out of harm's way.

""When it comes to relocation, it's very tricky,"" Bosquet told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""It's not clear that we will have the time or money sufficient to do relocation everywhere.""

Saint-Louis has identified a few potential plots where the 10,000 people at risk or already displaced could move, and is negotiating with neighbouring communes for the land, said Ousmane Sow, director of the regional development agency.

In the best-case scenario, houses could be built and people relocated within two years, he said.

""We are counting on the state,"" said Faye in Khar Yalla - a sentiment echoed by others who have already seen their homes disappear.

But Sow anticipates challenges in resettling people the water has yet to reach. ""We will have to convince them,"" he said.

One of the potential relocation sites is close to Saint-Louis, but the city may not be able to seal a deal for the land, he said.

Another option is about 30 km away. It is close to the sea, so fisherman would not have to travel too far.

But it is only a matter of time - perhaps several decades - before the water arrives there too, Sow said.

Researchers led by the University of Exeter in the UK examined how climate change could affect the vulnerability of different countries to food insecurity - when people lack access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food.

The study, published in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, looked at 122 developing and least-developed countries, mostly in Asia, Africa and South America.

The countries at the greatest vulnerability to food insecurity when moving from the present-day climate to 2 degrees Celsius global warming are Oman, India, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, researchers said.

""Climate change is expected to lead to more extremes of both heavy rainfall and drought, with different effects in different parts of the world,"" said Richard Betts, a professor at the University of Exeter.

""Such weather extremes can increase vulnerability to food insecurity,"" said Betts.

Representational Image

""Some change is already unavoidable, but if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, this vulnerability is projected to remain smaller than at 2 degrees Celsius in approximately 76 per cent of developing countries,"" he said.

Warming is expected to lead to wetter conditions on average - with floods putting food production at risk - but agriculture could also be harmed by more frequent and prolonged droughts in some areas, researchers said.

Wetter conditions are expected to have the biggest impact in South and East Asia, with the most extreme projections suggesting the flow of the River Ganges could more than double at 2 degrees Celsius global warming, they said.

""Some areas are projected to see an increase in flood event lengths of 4 days or more, particularly India and Bangladesh, for which such increases are projected in all ensemble members to some extent, researchers said.

AP

The areas worst affected by droughts are expected to be southern Africa and South America - where flows in the Amazon are projected to decline by up to 25 per cent, according to the researchers.

They examined projected changes in weather extremes and their implications for freshwater availability and vulnerability to food insecurity.","Mon, 02 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://im.indiatimes.in/facebook/2018/Apr/facebook_food_crisis_india_1522667866.jpg,"['deepens', 'extremes', 'greatest', 'climate', 'shortage', 'countries', 'crisis', 'vulnerability', 'degrees', 'change', 'projected', 'global', 'insecurity', 'food', 'expected', 'india', 'risk']",

Wright has been selected as the next president and chief executive officer of the organization, succeeding Julie Rochman who is retiring after more than 10 years at the helm.

Wright joins IBHS from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), where he most recently led the agency’s resilience, risk management, risk reduction, and flood insurance programs. Wright served as chief executive for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and led the reinsurance and risk transfer program that helped financially support the NFIP in the context of 2017’s record breaking storms.

The non-profit IBHS is dedicated to researching and promoting effective strategies to strengthen homes and businesses against a variety of natural hazards. IBHS is wholly supported by the property insurance industry.

Wright is expected to assume his new roles on April 25. He will be based at the IBHS Research Center in Chester County, South Carolina.

A California native, Wright has a Master of Public Administration degree from The George Washington University, and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Azusa Pacific University.

“After conducting an exhaustive nationwide search, we are confident that Roy has the right blend of experience, vision, and leadership skills to accelerate IBHS’ progress toward tangibly reducing the terrible losses Mother Nature inflicts each year with wind, hail, wildfire and other perils,” said Eric Nelson, senior vice president for CAT Strategy & Analysis at The Travelers Companies, Inc., and IBHS vice chairman. Nelson led the IBHS CEO search committee.

“IBHS has only begun to realize its full, incredible potential as an organization and dynamic force for positive change, and I am honored to take the helm,” Wright said. “I look forward to working with IBHS members and the institute’s highly talented leadership team and staff. We will continue to prove the value of resilience and encourage home and business owners to take steps large or small to reduce disaster response and recovery expenditures. Whether those costs are borne by homeowners, business owners, insurers, or a government agency at some level, we all benefit by favorably bending the cost curve and keeping the fabric of lives, commerce and society intact.”

Since joining IBHS as president and CEO in late 2007, Rochman has re-oriented and grown the organization. Under her leadership, IBHS has gained new insights into structural vulnerabilities – particularly involving roofing systems – and provided information about how to strengthen both new and existing buildings.

In addition, Rochman spearheaded creation of IBHS’ one-of-a-kind research facility in South Carolina, which is capable of simulating hurricanes and wind storms, hail storms, wildfire ember storms, and wind-driven rain to test the strength and durability of full-scale residential and commercial building systems and materials.

IBHS is supported by the property/casualty insurance industry. Its board of directors includes representatives from leading insurers including Travelers, Nationwide, State Farm, Liberty Mutual, Swiss Re, General Re, USAA and others.

The ASEAN region is one of the most disaster-prone regions in the world, and extreme climate events are projected to increase in frequency and intensity due to climate variation and change.

We have seen the impacts that proper preparation and resilience -building efforts can have in the face of disaster events. The APEC Climate Center believes that science and policy, when merged and effectively utilized together, can truly enhance disaster risk reduction and disaster management. Through the ASDMP project, funded by the Republic of Korea government, the APEC Climate Center has worked closely with the AHA Centre, ASEAN Secretariat, and the ASEAN Committee on Disaster Management to enhance DRR and DRM in the region.

This research roadmap provides a guideline on a potential process that will help achieve the ASEAN region’s goal of becoming a global leader on disaster management by 2025. The ASDMP project team has travelled the ASEAN region to ensure the reflection of local knowledge in this roadmap, and surveys have been distributed widely in an attempt to fully understand the status of DRR and DRM in the region.

This roadmap has identified key research and initiatives that need to take place in the short and long term on both the country and regional level, in order to greatly enhance resilience to disasters in the ASEAN region.

APCC would like to thank the Republic of Korea government, AHA Centre, ASEAN Secretariat, the ASEAN Committee on Disaster Management, and the respective governments of the ASEAN Member States for their active participation and support throughout the project duration.

Dr. Hong-Sang Jung Executive Director APEC Climate Center

Message from the ACDM Chair

The ASEAN region sits between several tectonic plates, which cause many extreme climate events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis. Also being between the Pacific and Indian oceans causes seasonal typhoons. The ASEAN region is prone to almost all types of natural disasters including typhoons, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, landslides, forest fires, epidemics, and droughts. These extreme climate events often transcend the boundaries of individual nations, and that is why we must work together across boundaries to limit the potential damages of these events.

Therefore, the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community Blueprint 2025 stipulates on the paragraph D.1. that: A Disaster Resilient ASEAN that is able to Anticipate, Respond, Cope, Adapt, and Build Back Better,

Smater, and Faster.

I still remember my participation in the Kickoff Workshop for the ASEAN Science-Based Disaster Management Platform Project (ASDMP), which was taking place between 30th-31st March 2016 in Busan, Korea.

One of the above-mentioned workshop’s objectives is to Increase APCC’s network in the ASEAN region to increase the likelihood of cooperation and collaboration not only on the ASDMP Project but also on the future needs/projects. Today the objectives have been translated into concrete work. The Research Roadmap is an outstanding result, because this Disaster Roadmap management creates hope for all ten ASEAN Member States to use this as a guiding process for achieving the goal of becoming a global leader on Disaster Management by 2025.

On behalf of the ASEAN Committee on Disaster Management I would like to extend my gratitude and sincere thanks to the Republic of Korea Government, APCC, ASEAN Secretariat, AHA Center, and the respective organisations, and especially all of the experts for their close and fruitful contributions to the Research Roadmap.

""Five family members who fled their homes were returned to relatives' houses in Maungdaw town in Myanmar's Rakhine state via Taung Pyo Letwei receiving center,"" the Myanmar government's information committee said in a statement.

However, Saturday's repatriations come despite warnings from the UN that Myanmar is not ready to receive returning Rohingya people.

Myanmar's military launched a brutal crackdown against the country's Muslim minority last August, forcing almost 700,000 Rohingya to flee across the border into neighboring Bangladesh.

Myanmar justified the crackdown, saying it was waging a counterinsurgency operation after Rohingya militants attacked a series of police outposts in Rakhine.

However, Rohingya people and rights groups reported that Myanmar security forces carried a series of extrajudicial killings, rapes and arson attacks as they forced the Muslim minority out of the country. The United Nations and the United States described the crackdown as an ""ethnic cleansing"" campaign.

A prosecutor for the International Criminal Court in the Hague this week asked the court to rule whether it has jurisdiction over the exodus of Rohingya to Bangladesh, citing possible crimes against humanity.

UN wary of Rohingya safety concerns

Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed in January to complete the voluntary repatriation of the Rohingya refugees over two years. Myanmar said it had set up two reception centers and a temporary camp on the border in Rakhine to house the first arrivals.

However, during a visit to the camps last week, UN Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Ursula Müller said the conditions were ""deplorable"" and not conducive to the return of refugees.

Müller also raised concern about the safety and protection of the Muslim minority once back in Myanmar, adding that Rakhine was still suffering from dangerous lack of access to health services.

Rohingya recognition on the cards?

The Myanmar government also said in its statement that the Rohingya family was issued with a so-called ""National Verification Card,"" or NVC.

The NVCs are part of Myanmar's ongoing efforts to register Rohingya Muslims for the first time without granting them full citizenship. Rohingya community leaders, however, have largely rejected the card, saying it allows the government to treat life-long residents like new immigrants.

The Muslim minority group has largely shunned a form national identification. Most Burmese consider the Rohingya as unwanted Bangladeshi immigrants and the Myanmar government has forced them to register as ""Bengali"" ethnics, inferring that they are of Bangladeshi origin.

57,57,FL-2018-000105-BGD,Which Cities Are Most Vulnerable to Climate Change Conflict? - Pacific Standard,https://psmag.com/environment/the-cities-most-vulnerable-to-climate-conflict,"As food and water sources become threatened by changing weather patterns, experts say these are the areas most susceptible to instability and bloodshed.

People collect drinking water from pipes fed by an underground spring, in St. James, about 25km from Cape Town's city center, on January 19th, 2018. (Photo: Rodger Bosch/AFP/Getty Images)

We know that climate change imperils coastal communities around the world and endangers food and water sources, and that political and religious extremism feed off instability and cause bloodshed. But because each contributes to the other, the future of millions may be at risk.

A 2013 University of California–Berkeley study analyzed 60 previous studies and concluded that the connection between climate change and human conflict is strong. Droughts and famines, floods, wildfires, and other events caused at least in part by climate change lead to instability that extremist groups can take advantage of to create conflict.

A more recent report by CNA, a research non-profit with national-security expertise, focuses on the connection between water stress and conflict. ""Water stress can empower violent extremist organizations and place stable governments at risk,"" the authors write. Some experts believe we are heading toward a point where water will be more difficult to come by and brutal wars will be fought over control of fresh-water resources.

Sherri Goodman, a senior fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center and the United States' former deputy undersecretary of defense for environmental security, coined the term ""threat multiplier"" to describe how climate change accelerates security risks. She said water stress is a source of instability around the globe. ""When there is a shortage or scarcity of water, it can be used to make people vulnerable and can be used by combatants, terrorists, or others to put innocents in precarious positions for exploitation, to force migration, and to target vulnerable populations,"" Goodman said. ""You can see that that's happened now in Yemen. You can see the patterns of prolonged drought in Syria, which forced migration."" Where else could climate change prove especially destabilizing? Experts say the cities below are among those most at risk of climate-related conflict. The good news is that at least two of them are taking measures to prevent it.

Cape Town

If you've been following the global news, you know that taps may be turned off completely in Cape Town, South Africa, in coming months because of water scarcity. (However, officials recently announced that ""Day Zero"" may be averted, thanks to conservation measures in place now.) If taps are shut off, residents will have to go to collection points in the city to get water, and the army and police would be deployed to maintain order. Residents are bracing for ""chaos."" Violence could flare, Goodman said.

Mismanagement of resources and unsustainable development have been blamed for the water crisis in Cape Town. Though climate experts warned of a looming water shortage literally for decades, city officials continued to approve commercial developments that drained water resources and allowed rich residents to consume more than their fair share of the water supply.

This is the city's worst drought in over a century, so it's possible that running out of water may have been unavoidable. But it's clear this disaster could have, at minimum, been delayed with better resource management.

Karachi

In some parts of Pakistan's largest city, taps have run dry for extended periods of time, and the water drawn from wells is too salty to drink. According to Karachi's water utility, a full 42 percent of the municipal water supply is either lost to leakage or stolen. Water thieves siphon it off to sell to thirsty residents.

Neil Bhatiya, a research associate at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank, pointed to Karachi as an example of the nexus between climate change and conflict. India and Pakistan share water sources and have, Bhatiya said, a ""contentious"" relationship when it comes to water management (among other issues).

""Pakistan has a pretty well documented link between rhetoric around resource scarcity—in particular, water—and a lot of the anti-Indian terrorists that operate out of either Kashmir or Pakistan itself,"" Bhatiya said. ""It's something extremist groups have used as a recruiting tool.""

Protests are already frequent on Karachi's streets and often turn violent. With its population growing fast, demand for water—and for food crops that need water—will rise too. Meanwhile, the Indus River, the source of most of Pakistan's water, is supplying less than it did 50 years ago. Some of the newcomers swelling Karachi's population of 15 million are climate migrants, who have left rural areas due to extreme heat, drought, or flooding. If their numbers increase, so will competition for resources.

Meanwhile, the city on the Arabian Sea is at high risk from rising sea levels, which could displace many residents in coming decades.

Dhaka

Bangladesh's largest city faces problems related to sea-level rise, water and food shortages, overpopulation, and other risks. But the country is also a renewable energy model. The national-government-sponsored company Idcol has installed small solar systems in millions of homes across the country, and a solar plant now supplies electricity to the national grid. Dhaka's climate-resilience initiatives include improving trash collection to keep drains clear and promoting green roofs to offset the urban heat-island effect and soak up stormwater.

""In [Dhaka's] poor neighborhoods, communities are training emergency response volunteers, installing solar panels, starting community savings schemes and providing job training,"" according to a report from the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""Of all of the governments of the developing world, I think Bangladesh is the one that has been fairly good about articulating the nature of the crisis and placing it within a larger political and diplomatic context,"" Bhatiya said.

Political instability in the country threatens its ability to respond to disasters. But Goodman said many national officials see the connection between climate issues and conflict and want to make sure citizens aren't taken advantage of by extremist groups. ""Extremists thrive on conditions of vulnerability, where people can't provide for themselves and their families,"" she said.

Manila

As Typhoon Haiyan tragically showed in 2013, the island nation of the Philippines is among the countries that are most exposed to natural hazards. It is also at high risk from climate change. (See this map for a region-by-region breakdown.)

""Heat stress, extreme precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, as well as drought and water scarcity pose risks"" to Manila and other tropical and sub-tropical coastal cities, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Coastal areas of Metro Manila are ""faced with the possibility of having ... huge portions of their communities submerged."" Last September, torrential rains led to a landslide that killed two people outside of the city.

As part of the Paris Agreement, the Philippines pledged to meet a 70 percent reduction of climate emissions by 2030. Back in 2009, it created a national climate-change commission, which runs adaptation and mitigation initiatives. President Rodrigo Duterte's stance on climate change has fluctuated, but a $500 million flood-control system for Metro Manila—part of the president's ""golden age of infrastructure""—is set to begin construction soon.

Terrorist groups including Abu Sayyaf and ISIS are active in the Philippines, and radicalization could thrive in the uncertainty and hardship following a major disaster. Goodman said that, arguably, the country's proactive measures on climate change could help it avoid a major increase in conflict.

Because climate change and conflict are so inextricably tied, efforts to make a city more sustainable often double as increasing stability and security. Cities that prepare may be able avoid a breakdown of order. But cities that fail to act could come apart at the seams.

60,60,FL-2018-000105-BGD,It Is Water Not China That Has Ruined Nepal’s Relations With India - Outlook India,https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/it-is-water-not-china-that-has-ruined-nepals-relations-with-india/310684,"Khadga Prasad Oli, after assuming the office of the Prime Minister of Nepal in February, has come to India on his first foreign visit. This three-day visit with a 53 member delegation has started from 6 April 2018. Narendra Modi government is rolling out the red carpet for the Commrade Oli, who is also the Chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) and ideologically and politically close to China. In spite of his return to power after his left coalitions’ decisive victory over pro-India parties in the last election, Oli has decided to respect the tradition and select India for his first visit abroad. However, the relations between India and its smaller but strategically critical neighbor Nepal is not the same as it used to be in the past.

Large number of people move across the border regularly for jobs and other economic opportunities. Over and above, both the countries are Hindu majority countries. However, contrary to expectation, the relationship between these two countries have become openly conflictual and even hostile in recent years. Strong anti-India sentiment among Nepalese population is not new. The anti-India constituency in Nepal has been growing for decades, but what is new is due to China’s emergence as a global power has emboldened the political elites of Nepal to openly challenge India. A number of Nepalese political leaders are regularly using anti-India tirade to strengthen their political base. India is not in a position anymore to take Nepal for granted.

It is true that China has provided the strength to the political elites of Nepal to not to always listen to India anymore. But, the question one needs to ask that why Nepalese Hindu electorates, instead of being pro-India are mostly cheering for anti-India tirade of pro-China politicians. The anti-India popular sentiments in Bangladesh has been usually blamed by Indian analysts as the manifestation of religious divide between two countries. If that is so, there should not have been any anti-India sentiment in a predominantly Hindu country like Nepal. India and Nepal have disagreement over the issues of trade and transit and also on areas of security concerns. In recent years, India support for Madhesis has also become a major irritant. However, if one looks closely the bilateral relationship between India and Nepal, the most consistent and highly emotional reason of Nepalese anger has been India’s perceived exploitation of Nepal’s rich water resources for its own agricultural and energy needs.

Nepal might be an economically poor country, but it is extremely rich with river water resources. However, Nepal lacks the capital and technology required to build large dams and other water projects and also needs a buyer to sell its hydropower. In the past, India used to be the only country that was willing and able to provide assistance as it needed the water projects in Nepal for its own irrigation and hydropower needs and also for the flood control. Thus, India’s direct involvement in the utilization of the river water in Nepal has been crucial till now. But, there is a strong feeling in Nepal that the country has not been treated equitably under the various past water agreements with India.

The water issue has made the bilateral relations bitter even before India’s independence. The Colonial administration had signed the Sarada Treaty with Nepal in 1920, on the basis of which India contsructed the Sarada barrage on Mahakali River after exchanging 4,000 acres of territory. However, people of Nepal considerd the treaty being partial to India and became angry over the less amount of water allocated to them. After independence, India again pushed Nepal to sign agreements to build Kosi barrage in 1954 and Gandak Barrage in 1959. These India financed projects in Nepal were increasingly being perceived as ‘sell out’ of the national interest by most of the Nepalese and has been the catalyst for popular opposition to any of India’s new projects in Nepal.

India is increasingly facing water scarcity. Besides adding to its water supply for the irrigation and drinking water needs, India also aims at developing river water resources in Nepal to produce hydro-power for its growing economy. However, increasing popular opposition within Nepal against ‘Indian’ water projects has delayed the implementation of several of them. Lack of trust in Nepal for India has brought an impasse to the implementation of the Mahakali Treaty, which had offered an opportunity in 1996 to both the countries to make a new start in re-conceptualizing their bilateral river water cooperation. Inspite of repeated promises, Narendra Modi government has also failed to start the construction of Pancheswar dam project under the Mahakali Treaty, instead the plan has started a new round of popular opposition in Nepal against India.

Nepal lacks the capital and technology required to build large dams, which are critical for the poor mountainous country to industrialize and develop. The perceived unfair treatment in its past water agreements and the ever increasing anti-India constituency in the country have pushed Nepal to explore Chinese finance and collaboration to develop its water resources in recent years. India’s unofficial economic blockade of Nepal after the Himalayan state’s promulgation of the new constitution on 20 September 2015, created unprecedented energy crisis in the country and the growing anger against India ignited Nepal’s desire for further closer ties with China. However, India continues to oppose China’s involvement in developing Nepal’s water resources. Just before the election in Nepal, in November 2017, the previous government under Nepalese Congress leader Sher Bahadur Deuba coming under Indian pressure had to cancel the US $2.5 billion deal with China’s Gezhouba Group to build Budhi Gandaki Hydro Electric Project. This turned out to be a big election issue for anti-India political establishment in Nepal. Prime Minister Oli now wants to give back the project to China to build but Modi government has made clear that it will not buy power if China builds the dam.

Water unites the countries and divides the countries as well. The water sharing issues have been adversely affecting bilateral relationship between India and Nepal for almost a century now. People in Nepal continue to believe that India has been unfair and unjust while ‘exploiting’ their water resources. Disagreement over water resource development has been the constant and dominant reason for the anti-India constituency to gain strength in Nepal. With the blessings of China, it is not reluctant anymore to challenge India. Prime Minister Oli’s visit to India in this backdrop is not going to bring any change to the pitiable status of the bilateral relationship. Oli politically benefits by opposing India rather than being seen by his supporters as an Indian ally. If India wants to keep China out of a democratic Nepal, it needs to find ways to build goodwill and trust among the people of Nepal. The first step in that direction for India will be to find a formula of developing Nepal’s water, which will be perceived by Nepalese fair and just. It is not Oli or China, it is water which is the key for India to keep Nepal at her side.

Express News Service

GUWAHATI: An Assam woman’s love affair and elopement with a young man from Bangladesh has ended in arrest. Bangladeshi authorities picked her up on Tuesday for entering the country without valid travel documents.

The arrest came days after 21-year-old Mousumi Das, a final-year college student from Karimganj in southern Assam’s Barak Valley, converted to Islam and married Numan Badshah of Dhaka. She met Badshah at a recent trade expo in Karimganj and fell in love with him.

After she went missing on March 12, her parents lodged a kidnapping case. That she was in Bangladesh emerged when videos of her went viral on social media.

In a video, she is clad in a burqa. In another, she is heard saying she was not kidnapped but had eloped with Badshah.

Karimganj police said the duo had entered Bangladesh via Tripura.

“Badshah came to India on a business visa. He works with a company that deals in sarees. There was a trade expo in Karimganj where she met him,” Karimganj Superintendent of Police, Gaurav Upadhyay, told The New Indian Express. He said Bangladesh police had taken Mousumi into custody and was to have been produced before a magistrate on Wednesday.

“There are two possibilities. She might be given a sentence under their law for illegal entry. The Indian high commissioner in Bangladesh may seek consular access to her. If it is granted, the high commission will record her statement and get her nationality verified. Once that is done, she will be repatriated,” Upadhay said.

“The second possibility, which I don’t think is realistic, is that she will be pushed back. Things have gone beyond the control of the police. They are now between two countries.” The incident has set tongues wagging that this is a case of “love jihad”.","Thu, 05 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2018/4/5/w600X390/Prisoners.jpg,"['high', 'trade', 'indian', 'expo', 'bangladesh', 'arrested', 'went', 'mousumi', 'bangladeshi', 'man', 'college', 'eloping', 'student', 'karimganj', 'met', 'love', 'assam']",

It also plans to gradually change the spellings of a few other districts as well, an additional secretary of the Cabinet Division made the disclosure on Friday. The secretary, on condition of anonymity, said: “Officials concerned are working to identify inconsistencies in the current Bangla and English spellings of districts across Bangladesh.” According to a proposal being considered, officials recommend changing the English spellings of districts from Chittagong to ""Chattagram,"" Barisal to ""Barishal,"" Comilla to ""Kumilla,"" Jessore to ""Jashore,"" and Bogra to ""Bagura."" When asked about the possible date for project completion, the government official said: “These things take time. Before making the changes, we have to consider a district’s historical origin, local dialect, Bangla and English pronunciation, and meaning of the name. “We may have to discuss the matter with linguists as the project gradually moves forward.” On March 29, Cabinet Secretary Mohammad Shafiul Alam announced an initiative to update the English spellings of Barisal, Chittagong, Comilla, Bogra and Jessore, in accordance with their Bangla pronunciation. Speaking to the reporters, Shafiul said: “A proposal will be placed in this regard at the meeting of the National Implementation Committee for Administrative Reorganization-Reform (NICAR) meeting on April 2.” The meeting, set to be chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, will be held at the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) in Tejgaon.

While many have welcomed the move saying the new spelling – Bogura – is the correct one, others think it will just create unnecessary confusion and problems for the government and the locals. A number of people, however, appeared indifferent to the issue. Dalia Nasrin Rikta, Bogra district unit general secretary of Jubo Mohila League, an affiliated organization of ruling Awami League, said the previous spelling was wrong and the government had corrected the spelling now. “People should not be confused about this,” she said. Abdus Salam Babu, a central leader of the Jatiya Party, also echoed Dalia’s response to the government decision. A meeting of the National Implementation Committee for Administrative Reorganizations-Reforms (Nicar), which works under the Cabinet Division, last Monday had taken the decision to change the English spellings of five districts’ names. Many people complained that the decision will require them to spend additional money to change the spelling of Bogra in all important documents, including National Identity cards, educational certificates, passports and birth certificates, which might lead to prolonged harassment. However, officials of different government organizations, including the Election Commission, said the change would not be in effect for the time being. The government would bear the cost in changing the spelling gradually. Bogra District Election Officer Dewan Md Sarwar Jahan said: “If the government decides to introduce new software, the spelling will be changed in every document including the National ID. This is the state’s decision. The people will not have to bear the responsibility for this.”Asadur Rahman, a businessman from Dupchanchia Upazila, said because of this decision Bogra spelling would also have to be changed in different databases used for foreign trade and personal communication. According to locals and academics, Bogra district was named after Sultan Nasiruddin Bughra Khan, the second son of Sultan Ghiyas ud din Balban of the Mamluk dynasty of Delhi, when he became the independent ruler of Bengal in 1200 AD. Some said changing Bogra’s English spelling to Bogura would be tantamount to distortion of history. One of them was Dhunot Upazila Chairman and district BNP Joint Secretary AKM Touhidul Alam Mamun. He said: “This has distorted the history. The spelling will now have to be changed everywhere and that will cost a huge amount of money.” Government Shah Sultan College Principal Prof Ezazul Haque also said this move was unnecessary.","Thu, 05 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2013/09/bogra-edited-3.jpg,"['english', 'reactions', 'weigh', 'district', 'decision', 'locals', 'pros', 'cons', 'bogra', 'bogura', 'change', 'sultan', 'including', 'spelling', 'national', 'mixed']",

DGDA to adopt tougher stance

The value of pharmaceutical products sold in Bangladesh is expected to double over a five-year period due to improper food habits and medical illiteracy among patients, health experts have warned. According to the Bangladesh Investment Guide 2018 made by local financial service institution LankaBangla, the pharmaceuticals sector is on course to reach $4.75 billion, or Tk390 billion, by 2022. As of June 2017, annual sales were at $2.28 billion, or Tk187.56 billion. The guide said over 50% of the total revenue is currently generated from the sales of gastronomical drugs. The other top-selling drugs were from the anti-ulcerant category, the antibiotic molecule category (2 medicines), anti-pyretic molecule category (2 medicines), one from among anti-allergens, and one from the sedative molecule category. More than providing statistics, this makes an alarming comment on the state of the country’s population-wide health. Physicians said that the trend of sales showed that the eating habits of the country are deteriorating, consequently leading to health complications requiring expensive medication. As a result, most of the patients were approaching pharmacies directly in search of cheaper alternatives, rather than going to medical professionals. “Despite tremendous effort from the government and NGOs, a huge portion of the poorer section of society does not know where to go for primary treatment,” Associate Professor AFM Saidur Rahman of Bangladesh Medical College Hospital said. “As they feel better faster by taking medicine, they avoid going for proper treatment. The medicine here is also very expensive.”Professor Rahman said that although most Bangladeshi families have increased their expenditure on food in recent times, patients still have improper food habits. “If people could ensure a balanced diet, that would be more beneficial to us in building a healthier nation, rather than depending on medicine,” he said. According to tradingeconomics.com, the cost of food in Bangladesh increased by 7.13% in December 2017 compared to the previous year. Food Inflation in Bangladesh averaged 6.70% from 2013 until 2017, reaching an all-time high of 9.09% in May 2014 and a record low of 3.77% in February 2016. The Preliminary Report on the Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2016 by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics said the highest portion of household expenditure has been on food and beverages (47.69%). However, the survey said the expenditure has reduced compared to 2010. Furthermore, the list of food items purchased shows that consumers were selecting food items based on price. The survey said that consumption of food items such as wheat, potato, vegetables, mutton, milk, fruits, and sugar had reduced, whereas items like edible oil, onion, beef, chicken, eggs and fish had increased. President of the National Heart Foundation of Bangladesh Professor Brig (rtd) Abdul Malik told the Dhaka Tribune that the faulty food habits of the people would bring more expensive, complex diseases. “Most of these Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) could be prevented if people changed their food habits and started exercising, without resorting to taking medicines for minor reasons,” he said. The Household Survey 2016 said 20.54% of the population suffered from gastric ulcers, making it the most prevalent disease, followed by rheumatic fever which afflicts 13.15%, and asthma which afflicts 10.62%. Dr Saidur Rahman said that taking medicine for these conditions for too long without consulting doctors may cause health complications, and could even lead to cancer. “To ensure the proper sale of drugs and to avoid further problems, the directorate general of Drug Administration (DGDA) must perform the necessary duties and set up a procedure so that no medicine can be sold without a prescription,” he added.According to the investment guide, pharmacists and drug store attendants often suggest unnecessary medicine for common ailments due to the lax enforcement of drug control laws. Industry insiders attribute some 20% of sales to over-the-counter drug products. The actual percentage including sales without prescriptions is likely to be closer to 30%. Professor ABM Faroque of the Department of Pharmaceutical Technology at Dhaka University said that these medicines are available at drug stores without prescription, and so people are able to buy them easily, increasing market demand. “Following the market demand the companies are also taking different marketing strategies to promote these drugs,” he added. Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA) Superintendent ATM Golam Kibria Khan said to keep the situation under control and under proper surveillance, the guideline for model pharmacy was approved in 2017. According to DGDA, 119,217 drug stores are registered pharmacies, with more than 12,000 in Dhaka alone. There are around 30,000 more drug stores around the country which are running illegally, according to the DGDA.The DGDA began the distribution of placards to drug stores in recent months, attempting to raise awareness about the sale of antibiotics without prescriptions. Several pharmacies in Dhanmondi said they received the placards last week. Mohammad Rasel, an attendant at Lazz Pharma, told the Dhaka Tribune that they had been instructed by the authorities not to sell any antibiotics without proper prescriptions. DGDA Director Ruhul Amin said the initiative to distribute the placards was launched after surveillance of pharmacies revealed that neither attendants nor buyers were aware of the purpose of prescriptions. He added that while the focus was on antibiotics, the placards would also help to raise awareness about the necessity of prescriptions for other drugs.","Sat, 07 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2018/04/20140630-zakir-0096.jpg,"['products', 'pharmaceutical', 'improper', 'illiteracy', 'drugs', 'medicine', 'bangladesh', 'sale', 'taking', 'prescriptions', 'sales', 'diet', 'medical', 'habits', 'food', 'drug', 'dgda', 'fuels']",

69,69,FL-2018-000105-BGD,'Enemy Property' Cases: HC for quick settlement - The Daily Star,https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/enemy-property-cases-hc-quick-settlement-1556821,"The High Court has issued directives for properly and quickly settling the “enemy property” cases and ordering public officials not to make any attempt in future to include any property in the official gazette as “vested” one.

An HC Bench comprising Justice Obaidul Hassan and Justice Krishna Debnath came up with nine directives in the full text of its verdict on a 2011 writ petition regarding the enemy property ordinance and laws.

In the verdict, the court observed that the 1962 Pakistan constitution is not a constitution at all in the eye of law. So, enactment of the Enemy Property Act under the so-called charter was a “misnomer”.

The HC delivered a short verdict on November 23 last year, and its full text was released yesterday.

One Md Abdul Hye had filed the writ petition challenging the legality of the Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provisions) (Repeal) Act-1974 and the Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provisions) (Repeal) Amendment Ordinance-1976.

The petition also challenged all actions taken pursuant to the said ordinance, and fresh listing of “enemy property” subsequent to enactment of the 1974 act and section 6 (Ga) and (Gha) of the Vested Property Return Act-2001.

Petitioner's lawyer Mohammad Imtiaz Farooq told the HC that the concept of “enemy property” emerged from the 1965 war between Pakistan and India.

The break in the history of Pakistan and the Independence of Bangladesh in 1971 diminished the need or justification for continuance of the 1969 ordinance. Against this backdrop, the 1974 act was enacted repealing the ordinance, he added.

But successive governments, in utter disregard for the proclamation of independence and the history of struggle for the liberation, continued the process of listing “enemy property” in an independent Bangladesh, the lawyer added.

He argued that any inclusion of “enemy property” after the enactment of the 1974 act is liable to be declared to have been done illegally.

Barrister Imtiaz further said that section 6 (Ga) and (Gha) of the 2001 act makes an exception to return of the property which had been disposed of by the government without taking into consideration that such right to dispose of any property of a citizen of Bangladesh terming it “the property of enemies of Pakistan” is violation of the constitution.

In the full verdict, the HC ruled that the government may set up an exclusive tribunal having no other jurisdiction but only to dispose of the applications under section 10 of the Vested Property Return Act-2001 in every district, and more than one tribunal may be set up in the district where a huge number of petitions are pending.

The court directed the tribunals already set up under that law to dispose of the applications maintaining the timeframe strictly as provided in the act.

It said the Limitation Act-1908 should be made applicable in filing application under section 10 (1) of the 2001 act.

Section 5 of Limitation Act reads, “Any appeal or application for a revision or a review of judgment or for leave to appeal or any other application to which this section may be made applicable by or under any enactment for the time being in force may be admitted after the period of limitation prescribed therefore, when the appellant or applicant satisfies the Court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such period.”

The HC also directed the authorities concerned to implement the decision of the appellate tribunal where no appeal has been preferred within the time of limitation.

It asked the government officials not to make any delay in executing the decree of the tribunal concerned on the plea of filing writ petition or any other plea in any way or in any other form.

The government by enacting the 2001 act decided to give back the property to the owner or successors-in-interest within shortest period of time, the court noted.

The judges said they believe the legislature should come forward in taking further legislative measures regarding the property listed under section 6 (Ga) and (Gha) of the 2011 act.

There should be a special appellate tribunal in each district as the law provides for setting it up to decide the appeal against the verdict of the tribunal concerned, the court said.

It further observed, “The property which has been lying with the government as vested property having no legal claimant should be utilised by the government for the purpose of human development only.

“The government may take necessary measures by enacting law in respect of properties which were vested to the government and where institutions have already been developed for the purpose of the development of the country may be named after the original and lawful owner.

“The legislature may enact law to give sufficient and just compensation to a lawful claimant in lieu of returning the property to him whose property has already been made non-returnable under the provision of section 6.”

The HC judges also observed that the 1962 constitution of Pakistan was not a constitution at all in the eye of law because it was given to the nation not by the people's representatives but by a usurper abrogating the 1956 constitution which was duly framed and adopted by the then Constituent Assembly.

“Thus the Enemy Property Act [EPA], which was promulgated under a void constitution of 1962 given by a usurper, the Pakistan Defence Rule 1965 and the Ordinance I of 1969 and its continuance under the garb of Act XLV of 1974 were a misnomer.

The success of these projects depends, in part, on our understanding of how delta plains evolve over time scales longer than the instrumental record. Building on a new set of optically stimulated luminescence ages, we demonstrate that a large portion (~10,000 km2) of the late Holocene river–dominated Mississippi Delta grew in a radially symmetric fashion for almost a millennium before abandonment. Sediment was dispersed by deltaic distributaries that formed by means of bifurcations at the coeval shoreline and remained active throughout the life span of this landform. Progradation rates (100 to 150 m/year) were surprisingly constant, producing 6 to 8 km2 of new land per year. This shows that robust rates of land building were sustained under preindustrial conditions. However, these rates are several times lower than rates of land loss over the past century, indicating that only a small portion of the Mississippi Delta may be sustainable in a future world with accelerated sea-level rise.

INTRODUCTION Many of the world’s largest deltas undergo rapid transformations due to reductions in sediment supply (1), accelerating rates of sea-level rise (2), plus some of the world’s highest subsidence rates (3). The Holocene stratigraphic record contains abundant information on the ability of delta plains to grow within the constraints of these controls. However, this archive has only partially been explored, in part due to a historic lack of geochronological tools that are necessary to quantify rates of change. Previous studies have assessed the timing of delta lobe (subdelta) activity through radiocarbon dating of bounding peat (4) and shoreline progradation through optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of beach-ridge deposits (5). However, delta growth is fundamentally driven by distributary channel activity. Currently available records of delta growth rely largely on instrumental data obtained over the recent decades. For example, the mean land growth rate of the Wax Lake Delta, a recent bayhead delta within the Mississippi Delta, United States (Fig. 1, A and B), has been reported at 0.8 to 3.1 km2/year (6, 7). However, the assessment of delta growth over small temporal and spatial scales may reveal little about how river-dominated deltas operate over longer time scales. Fig. 1 Major past and present paths of the Mississippi River. (A) Channel belts and avulsion sites in the Lower Mississippi Valley and Mississippi Delta (for location, see inset), after the study of Saucier (43). (B) Mississippi Delta, including the Lafourche subdelta, the Modern (Balize) subdelta with the birdfoot delta, and the Atchafalaya subdelta with the Wax Lake and Atchafalaya deltas. Trunk channels that feed these subdeltas branch into multiple distributaries at polyfurcation points, which define the landward limit of bayhead deltas. The two most recent deltaic avulsion sites are the Lafourche-Modern (L-M) and Modern-Atchafalaya (M-A) avulsions. Previous work (18) was conducted at Paincourtville (PV) and Napoleonville (NV). (C) Location of cross sections, with distance in river kilometers from the Lafourche subdelta polyfurcation point shown in parentheses. Understanding the rates and patterns of delta growth through distributary channel activity is essential for predicting future deltaic land change (8), managing sediment resources (9), and understanding the effects of human perturbations on deltas (4). This information will be of paramount importance in the 21st century as major population and economic centers in large deltas struggle with rapid environmental change. These issues are exemplified well by the Mississippi Delta, where the deposition of clastic sediment by the trunk channel of the Mississippi River (the primary population and infrastructure corridor) is severely hampered by flood protection levees. Despite the growth of new land in the Wax Lake and Atchafalaya deltas and, to a lesser extent, in the birdfoot delta (Fig. 1B), net land loss rates for the delta plain are about 45 km2/year, averaged over the past century (10). The postindustrial sea-level acceleration is likely a relatively small factor herein. Direct human activities—including reduced sediment delivery, dredging of canals, subsequent saltwater intrusion and wave erosion, and fluid extraction—have played a primary role in the recent degradation of the delta plain (11). Land loss in deltas can be offset by the controlled delivery of new sediment to the delta plain (9, 12, 13). For example, a $50 billion management plan for coastal Louisiana includes proposals to create new land by the year 2065 through engineered river diversions (13) that would reintroduce clastic deposition by means of sediment-laden river water. Developing realistic expectations for the efficacy of these strategies requires an understanding of the natural deltaic processes (for example, distributary channel growth rates and drivers of avulsion) that govern land growth over time scales well beyond decadal-scale instrumental records and the slightly longer historical records (~165 years) (14). In addition to information on fluvial sediment loads (15) and deltaic sediment retention efficiency (16), centennial- to millennial-scale records of rates of land growth in the Mississippi Delta are needed to evaluate whether it is possible to significantly offset the high rates of present-day land loss by means of river diversions. There is currently a lack of field data to answer these questions. Here, we use OSL dating of mouth bar deposits from the Lafourche subdelta (Fig. 1B) to determine the rates and patterns of growth in the Mississippi Delta. Luminescence techniques enable the direct dating of both subaqueous and subaerial fluviodeltaic deposits (17) and have proven successful for dating the deposition of Mississippi Delta sediment (18). Mouth bars form as distributaries deliver their sediment load to a receiving basin and reflect deposition of the coarsest sediment fractions as flow decelerates when it meets a standing water body. This results in a sand-dominated deposit that progrades and aggrades to fill the basin (19). Vertical accretion of mouth bars occurs more rapidly than can be resolved by OSL. OSL samples taken from any depth within Lafourche subdelta mouth bars therefore reveal the timing of both mouth bar formation and land emergence. Other chronometers, such as radiocarbon dating of peats (20), may provide chronologies for the initiation and termination of subdelta activity, but they are less powerful for the direct dating of fluviodeltaic clastic strata. OSL dating of mouth bar sand is therefore the preferred tool to directly capture the time of emergence of new land and thus the progradation of the Lafourche subdelta shoreline. The Mississippi Delta is composed of a series of subdeltas that formed when quasi-periodic avulsions of major distributaries relocated the depocenter (21). The 10,000-km2 Lafourche subdelta was active from about 1.6 to 0.6 thousand years (ka) ago (18, 20) under conditions of fairly constant relative sea-level rise. Water and sediment discharge was shared with the Modern (Balize) subdelta after 1.4 to 1.0 ka ago (22). The abandonment of the Lafourche subdelta likely preceded the initiation of the Atchafalaya subdelta (22, 23), so river discharge was never shared between these two subdeltas. We selected the Lafourche subdelta for this study because it is the most recently abandoned subdelta in the Mississippi Delta. The Lafourche subdelta has experienced a complete delta cycle (24) and therefore provides an archive for river-dominated delta growth from initiation to termination, yet it has experienced limited reworking compared with older subdeltas. In addition, this system has a well-constrained sea-level history with a long-term sea-level rise trend of 0.6 mm/year (25). In the uppermost reach (about 55 river km long), the Lafourche system essentially features one trunk distributary channel that fed sediment to the surrounding delta plain through episodic overbank deposition, including abundant crevassing on top of a widespread wood peat bed (18). This demonstrates that the region between the avulsion site (L-M) and the furcation of the trunk channel (Fig. 1B) was subaerial before the initiation of the Lafourche subdelta (20). Here, we focus on the lower reach of the subdelta (seaward of the trunk channel) based on 10 cross sections roughly perpendicular to both the main distributary (Bayou Lafourche) and the lesser distributaries (Fig. 1C). Ages are presented in ka relative to 2010.

RESULTS Stratigraphy The Lafourche trunk channel splits into multiple smaller distributaries at 55 river km downstream of its divergence from the modern Mississippi River. This polyfurcation (that is, a furcation of the distributary network resulting in more than two channels) marks the pre-Lafourche shoreline and produced a distributary network that geomorphologically resembles a bayhead delta. Similar polyfurcations mark the antecedent shorelines of modern bayhead deltas, such as the Wax Lake and Atchafalaya deltas, and give rise to the birdfoot shape of the Modern (Balize) subdelta (Fig. 1B). Downstream of the Lafourche polyfurcation point, the Lafourche distributary system built new land by prograding into a shallow bay (Fig. 2). We refer to the area of new land created during Lafourche activity as the “bayhead delta” (~6000 to 8000 km2) and the broader area in which Lafourche sedimentation occurred as the “subdelta” (~10,000 km2). Fig. 2 Schematic illustration of the stratigraphy associated with bayhead delta progradation and aggradation. Red, sand (S); yellow, silt (Si); green, clay (Cl); OK, overbank deposits; MB, mouth bar deposits; DF, delta front deposits; BF, bay floor deposits. The bayhead delta exhibits a common succession of shell-rich bay-floor muds overlain by 1.3 ± 0.5–m–thick laminated delta front silts and then 2.1 ± 0.8–m–thick mouth bar sands, capped by overbank sediments of varying textures that thin both seaward and away from the channel (Figs. 3 and 4 and fig. S1). Overbank deposits are relatively fine-grained and somewhat organic near the base. In the more mature regions of the subdelta, the overbank unit grades vertically into a patchwork of relatively coarse deposits that pinch out coastward and away from the channel (Fig. 4). This shows that initial, channel-proximal elevation gain in the newly formed bayhead delta was dominated by the deposition of clays, likely through annual flooding. Later, elevation gain was characterized by deposition of predominantly silts associated with crevasse channels. The thickness of bayhead delta strata is similar between the main and lesser distributaries (fig. S2). The combined thickness of mouth bar and delta front deposits (referred to as “foundation deposits”) that aggraded to sea level and subsequently supported the growth of the subaerial delta through overbank deposition is consistent throughout the bayhead delta (Fig. 4). Fig. 3 Cross sections illustrating the stratigraphy adjacent to Bayou Lafourche. (A) Example of a cross section perpendicular to the main distributary at Galliano; additional cross sections are shown in the Supplementary Materials (fig. S1). Location and orientation of cross sections are shown in Fig. 1 (B and C). (B) Cross section parallel to the main distributary of the Lafourche subdelta. Deposits underlying the Lafourche bayhead delta that formed in a subaerial setting are referred to as “Pre-Lafourche.” In (B), weighted mean OSL ages and average sample depths are shown for locations seaward of the polyfurcation point, and the chronology for the PV I and NV II boreholes is from the previous studies (18, 20). Note that the uppermost portion of the overbank unit is highly generalized; for details, see the study of Shen et al. (18). All ages are presented as thousands of years (ka) ago, relative to 2010. Fig. 4 Downstream trend in the thickness of lithogenetic units. The average thickness of the MB and DF deposits for each transect is plotted against distance with reference to the Lafourche polyfurcation point (Fig. 1C). The thickness of the bayhead delta (BD) and foundation (FN) strata is also shown. The colored horizontal lines show the average thickness of the MB, DF, and FN deposits, and the orange line indicates the trend in thickness of the BD deposits. See the Supplementary Materials (fig. S2 and table S2) for uncertainties on the average thickness. Growth patterns Modern bayhead deltas have been shown to prograde in a radially symmetric pattern at their onset (26). This finding is consistent with observational and modeling studies demonstrating that the most seaward portion of a delta is characterized by bifurcations that produce coeval distributaries (27, 28). However, other studies suggest that radial growth of deltas may be restricted to these early stages, whereas more mature systems may prograde in succession by means of repeated avulsions within the subdelta distributary network. Such a mechanism has found support from a widely used Holocene Mississippi Delta radiocarbon chronology (29), as well as historical records of the human-modified Po (30) and Huanghe (31) deltas that feature distributary avulsions within 20 and 100 km of the present-day shoreline, respectively. Our results show that distributary mouth bars of the Lafourche subdelta at similar distances from the polyfurcation point have matching OSL ages (see Materials and Methods), indicating that growth was characterized by coeval distributary channels throughout its period of activity (Fig. 5). Contrary to what has been proposed by the previous work of Frazier (29), there is no evidence for avulsions within the distributary network of the Lafourche bayhead delta. We therefore conclude that the Lafourche distributaries formed by means of bifurcation. This demonstrates that radial growth through distributary channel progradation can persist in river-dominated deltas for nearly a millennium. These data also underscore a principle of distributary evolution evident in both modern and past landscapes of the Mississippi Delta: River-dominated delta systems branch at polyfurcation points associated with the paleo-shoreline (Fig. 1B). Fig. 5 Growth history of the Lafourche bayhead delta. (A) Weighted mean OSL ages determine the timing of new land creation through progradation of the bayhead delta of the Lafourche subdelta (inset). The bayhead delta is bounded to the north and west by the paleo-shoreline, to the south by transgressive Lafourche barrier islands, and to the east by open water (interdistributary lakes). (B) The progradation history of MB deposits associated with the main channel (filled symbols) and lesser distributaries (open symbols) is fit with a linear regression (r2 = 0.89). Growth rates It has been previously hypothesized that progradation slows and ultimately reverses with delta maturity because the area of the delta plain becomes too large to be supported by a constant sediment supply under conditions of constant accommodation creation (32). This process of “autoretreat” has been replicated in laboratory and model experiments (33) and has been offered as a possible explanation for transgressive successions found in the ancient stratigraphic record (34). Autoretreat has been proposed as a fundamental element of any deltaic system where the evolution of the system may be described by the ratio of accommodation creation to sediment supply rates (35). Progradation rates of deltas during the late Holocene have been assessed elsewhere (4, 36); however, the autoretreat concept has never been tested in a real-world setting with a well-constrained sea-level history and geochronology. The Lafourche bayhead delta grew at an average rate of 6 to 8 km2/year, associated with distributary mouth bar progradation at a relatively constant rate of 100 to 150 m/year (r2 = 0.89; see Materials and Methods) throughout most of the Lafourche activity (Fig. 5). This is a surprising result, considering that discharge was shared between the Lafourche distributaries and the modern Mississippi River after 1.4 to 1.0 ka ago (22). Furthermore, at least one major crevasse splay in the upstream reach of the Lafourche subdelta extracted a considerable amount of sediment from 0.8 to 0.6 ka ago (18). The constant progradation rate of the Lafourche shoreline indicates that autoretreat did not occur in this system during the time period of interest. Avulsions Avulsions constitute the principal mechanism that shift the depocenter within deltas, thereby driving delta evolution over centennial to millennial time scales. Our new results show that avulsions did not occur within the Lafourche subdelta, suggesting that subdeltas function fundamentally differently and should not be seen as miniature versions of the broader delta. Here, we zoom out to the entire Mississippi Delta and Lower Mississippi Valley to identify avulsion sites and to test the degree to which avulsions are preferentially located near a single node (37, 38) versus a broader zone (39, 40), corresponding to the backwater transition where channel-bed deposition is relatively rapid (39, 41). The link between backwater dynamics, bed aggradation, and avulsion has been described by the backwater number. The backwater number is defined as the backwater length divided by the avulsion length (the channel length between the avulsion site and the shoreline at the time of avulsion) (42) and is reported to range from 0.5 to greater than 4 (39, 40). The two most recent avulsion sites within the Mississippi Delta include the partial shift of the modern Mississippi River to the Atchafalaya River (M-A avulsion) and the partial shift of Bayou Lafourche to the modern river (L-M avulsion) (Fig. 1, A and B). The M-A avulsion was initiated at 0.5 to 0.3 ka ago (22). The M-A avulsion length is 490 river km (see Materials and Methods), comparable to the backwater length of the modern Mississippi River, yielding a backwater number of roughly 1 (41). The L-M avulsion occurred between 1.4 and 1.0 ka ago (22). Our data show that the Lafourche bayhead delta had prograded between 20 and 70 km beyond the polyfurcation point at this time, yielding an avulsion length of 75 to 125 km (see Materials and Methods), significantly shorter than the M-A avulsion length. Assuming similar backwater dynamics as in the modern system, the L-M backwater number is roughly 5. The backwater numbers of the two well-constrained avulsions within the Holocene Mississippi Delta are therefore generally compatible with backwater theory, but not with the concept of repeated avulsion around a single, backwater-mediated node. Evidence of other Holocene Mississippi River avulsions, in the form of relict channel belts, can be found more than 700 linear km inland, within the uppermost reaches of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Fig. 1A) (43). Assuming a sinuosity of 1.9 (44), this corresponds to avulsion lengths greater than 1300 km. This region has seen considerable (10 m or more) (43) Holocene aggradation, making avulsions almost inevitable. The locations of the two most recent avulsion sites in this region are relatively well defined, yet three or more older avulsions likely occurred within an ~250-km linear zone centered around Memphis, TN (see Materials and Methods). From this evidence, we conclude that avulsions of the Mississippi River are at least partially dictated by fluvial processes that occur far landward of the delta and extend well beyond the backwater transition. Our findings are consistent with observations of avulsion nodes occurring over an ~80-km linear distance and extending beyond the backwater transition in the Rhine-Meuse Delta (45), Netherlands, an area with significantly more data to address this problem (46). Within the Mississippi Delta, as well as in other muddy, river-dominated deltas, avulsions may be partly steered by factors such as sediment cohesion (39), which may drive the river to reoccupy easily erodible (sandy) channel belts (47) rather than forging new tracks through cohesive, muddy overbank strata.

DISCUSSION The consistent thickness of foundation deposits indicates that the pre-Lafourche bay floor depth was fairly uniform (3.4 ± 0.8 m) and remarkably similar to basin water depths of modern incipient bayhead deltas of the Atchafalaya subdelta (48). The Lafourche subdelta is therefore a good analog for present-day processes of bayhead delta growth, such as the proposed river diversions that are planned to convert open water into land. This similarity to the modern system enables a direct evaluation of the ability of present-day depositional systems (that is, incipient bayhead deltas and engineered diversions) to offset contemporary rates of Mississippi Delta land loss. Our finding that distributary networks polyfurcate at the coeval shoreline provides a framework by which the antecedent shoreline and stratigraphy of other river-dominated deltas may be inferred. On the basis of this, we hypothesize that the paleo-shoreline of the Modern (Balize) subdelta may have been positioned near the polyfurcation point of the birdfoot delta (Fig. 1B) at the time of Modern subdelta initiation. Although our work tests many fundamental principles of delta growth, our results are limited to describing deposits immediately proximal (at most a few kilometers) to distributary channels. The timing of land emergence in the distal, interdistributary flood basins of the Lafourche subdelta was not tested with our approach. It is possible that progradation and land creation rates varied over decadal or even centennial time scales. However, the precision of the OSL ages does not allow for confidently inferring this higher frequency variability. Furthermore, the nature of the discharge split between the Lafourche subdelta and the Modern (Balize) subdelta from 1.4 to 1.0 ka onward is not known. Despite these limitations, our work makes considerable contributions to the understanding of delta growth, which are relevant to the management of deltas. Avulsions of the Mississippi River are shown to most likely occur over a broad spatial zone that is only partly mediated by backwater dynamics, with a considerable density of avulsion sites 450 to 700 linear km inland that are unrelated to backwater hydraulics. In contrast, because no evidence was found for avulsions in prograding distributary channels, it seems unlikely that new bayhead deltas associated with river diversions will exhibit avulsions. Rather, they can be expected to grow radially by means of bifurcation. There are a number of potential reasons why autoretreat is not observed in the Lafourche subdelta, including a relatively slow rate of sea-level rise and a relatively high sediment supply, which may reduce the efficacy of autoretreat (35). It is also possible that other mechanisms, for example, higher sediment retention efficiency with increasing delta maturity, exert a primary control over delta growth. Alternatively, deltas situated on relatively open coasts and unconstrained by topography may avulse before they enter a state of autogenic decline. Regardless of the mechanism(s) that may enable sustained progradation, our findings raise questions about the applicability of the autoretreat concept to large deltas and their stratigraphic records. We document high average progradation rates of 100 to 150 m/year and land area creation rates of 6 to 8 km2/year within the Lafourche subdelta, sustained for nearly a millennium, that is, rates that are at least two times higher than present-day growth rates in the Wax Lake Delta (6). These rates are especially noteworthy considering that the sediment input was shared between the Lafourche subdelta and the Modern (Balize) subdelta (at least during the latter part of its existence). This finding is relevant to coastal planning because it shows that channels with diminished sediment flux, including the proposed river sediment diversions that siphon only a fraction of modern Mississippi River discharge during relatively short time periods, can be very effective in building new land. However, the average prehistoric rates of land growth are several times (by a factor of about 5 to 7) lower than the recent human-enhanced rates of Mississippi Delta land loss (10). Although areas beyond the Lafourche subdelta such as the Modern (Balize) subdelta may have also experienced growth during the time period of concern, there was undoubtedly significant decline in other portions of the Mississippi Delta (that is, pre-Lafourche subdeltas); thus, it is unlikely that net growth of the delta plain exceeded 6 to 8 km2/year. Furthermore, land building by the Lafourche subdelta occurred under the lowest rates of relative sea-level rise experienced by the Mississippi Delta throughout the Holocene (25). Considering recent land loss rates (~45 km2/year) (10) in combination with the global sea-level rise acceleration (49), net land loss in the modern delta will likely continue regardless of coastal restoration strategies, ultimately producing a deltaic landscape that will be very different from the present one.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This study used stratigraphic data obtained through hand coring and OSL dating through a combination of well-established and novel methods. Boreholes were drilled using an Edelman hand auger and gouge. Cores were discretized to 10-cm intervals and described in the field with attention to grain size following the U.S. Department of Agriculture texture classification scheme, sedimentary structures, and fossil content, which informed the interpretation of lithogenetic units (see table S1). The surface elevation at borehole sites was obtained from publicly available LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data. OSL samples were captured using a stainless steel Eijkelkamp sampler that prevents light exposure. Below, we describe the OSL dating approach, as well as the calculation of progradation and land change rates, and avulsion lengths. OSL sample preparation and measurement OSL samples were prepared under amber light at Tulane University following standard procedures (50, 51). Luminescence measurements were performed at the University of Liverpool using 1- to 2-mm aliquots of 75 to 125 μm (~110 grains) or 125 to 180 μm (~50 grains) purified quartz sand, adhered to 10-mm stainless steel discs. The coarsest grain-size fraction for which sufficient sediment was available was used. Descriptions of measurement facilities are given in the previously published work (52). A standard single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) protocol (53, 54) with a 200° or 220°C preheat, 180°C cut heat, three to four regenerative points, one recuperation point, and recycling checks including infrared (IR) depletion of the OSL signal (table S3) (55) was used to extract the equivalent dose (D e ). Note that D e herein refers solely to the absorbed radiation dose estimated from luminescence measurement for a single aliquot. Luminescence measurements were made for 40 s over 250 channels. The OSL signal was integrated over the first 0.48 s, and an early background interval, integrated over 0.48 to 1.76 s, was subtracted (56). Aliquot acceptance criteria included recycling and OSL IR depletion ratios of 10% (55), a maximum test dose error of 20%, and recuperation of 5% relative to the natural signal. OSL age calculation D e data sets were cleaned to remove potential outliers before age modeling (see the Supplementary Materials) and then treated with a bootstrap minimum age model (bootMAM) (57, 58) to obtain the paleodose for each sample. The paleodose is defined as the best estimate of the true burial dose (the average dose absorbed by the dated quartz sand grains within the sample since burial). The bootstrap approach provides the benefit of incorporating uncertainty on the width of the D e distribution (sigma_b) expected for well-bleached sands in this setting (57). To define the sigma_b input to bootMAM, this study used a new method for quantifying overdispersion based on the assumption that at least some samples contain only well-bleached quartz grains. This assumption was supported by initial tests, which showed that some samples (n = 5) had overdispersion values equal to or less than those considered characteristic of well-bleached Mississippi Delta sands by previous studies (18, 52). First, each D e data set (n = 23; see the Supplementary Materials) was analyzed with a central age model (CAM) (58), which gives a central value and overdispersion of the D e distribution of the sample (table S4). The values for overdispersion obtained through the CAM were grouped by grain size (75 to 125 μm or 125 to 180 μm) and input with their uncertainties into bootMAM (57) with sigma_b = [0,0]. The output revealed the overdispersion that is characteristic of the best-bleached samples within a given grain-size fraction. Overdispersion quantified with this approach was 11 ± 3% for 75- to 125-μm sand and 11 ± 4% for 125- to 180-μm sand. The exclusion and addition of samples to the overdispersion analysis are discussed in the Supplementary Materials. The natural radiation of bulk sediment was determined using activity concentrations of 40K and several radionuclides from the uranium and thorium series, measured using a gamma spectrometer at Tulane University (table S5). The dose rate was calculated using standard dose rate conversion (59) and cosmogenic contribution (60) factors (table S5). No external alpha contribution was included because the outer layer of the quartz grains was removed by etching. Beta dose attenuation was corrected for grain size (61), and attenuation due to pore water was calculated (62). Water content was measured by drying bulk sediment for each sample in a low-temperature oven, with 5% uncertainty added. OSL ages were calculated by dividing the paleodose obtained from the bootMAM by the dose rate shown in table S5. Two samples were dated per cross section, and paired ages that agreed within 2σ unshared uncertainty were accepted. One age (St. Charles I-2) was rejected; this is discussed further in the Supplementary Materials. Paired ages and their unshared uncertainties were treated with a weighted mean following the separation of shared (that is, instrument source calibration, dose rate conversion factors, and gamma spectrometer calibration) and unshared (that is, the spread of the D e distribution assigned by the age models, dose rate measurement error due to counting statistics, and water content) errors (63) to obtain a single age for land emergence at each cross section. Shared errors were returned in quadrature to the uncertainty of the weighted mean ages after application of the weighted mean. Progradation and land change rates The range of the Lafourche bayhead delta progradation rates (100 to 150 m/year) was obtained by dividing the distance between the most landward (St. Charles) and most seaward (Fourchon) cross sections (101 river km) by the minimum and maximum time span between emergence at these localities (0.65 to 0.97 ka, based on the 1σ uncertainty of the weighted mean OSL ages). The land area produced by the Lafourche bayhead delta was obtained by estimating different shoreline positions at the time of Lafourche subdelta abandonment; other boundaries are better constrained (Fig. 5). The minimum area (6000 km2) was calculated using the current position of the transgressive barrier island chain. The maximum area (8000 km2) was estimated by projecting the Lafourche subdelta beyond the most seaward cross section (Fourchon, 0.74 ± 0.06 ka), assuming a progradation rate of 150 m/year sustained by all distributaries for the final ~150 years of subdelta activity. The contemporary rate of land loss for the deltaic plain was calculated as the sum of areas lost from the Atchafalaya Delta, Barataria, Breton Sound, Mississippi River Delta, Pontchartrain, Teche-Vermilion, and Terrebonne basins over the time period of 1932 to 2016 (10). Avulsion lengths Avulsion lengths in the Mississippi Delta are presented in river kilometers, obtained along the center of river channels using Google Earth. The avulsion length range associated with the establishment of the present-day Mississippi River in the Mississippi Delta was obtained from the distance between the L-M avulsion site and the most seaward and landward positions possible for the Lafourche paleo-shoreline at the time of the avulsion (1.4 to 1.0 ka ago) and by placing the timing of Lafourche subdelta initiation at 1.6 ka ago. The most landward position was determined by multiplying the minimum time that the Lafourche subdelta had been active when the L-M avulsion occurred (0.2 ka ago) by the minimum rate of progradation (100 m/year). Multiplying the maximum time (0.6 ka ago) by the maximum rate of progradation (150 m/year) projected the most seaward position of the paleo-shoreline beyond the realistic region constrained by the OSL ages, and so we established this boundary by using the 1-ka isochron (Fig. 5). Holocene channel belts and their relative chronology have been mapped by Saucier (43). Avulsion sites associated with the creation of new channel belts were identified on the basis of the following criteria: (i) likely redirection of all flows to form a new channel belt, rather than partial redirection of flow via bifurcation; and (ii) the most inland departure between two sequential channel belts, rather than a point where channel belts may cross-cut downstream. Distinction was made between avulsion sites that unequivocally met these criteria versus those that were classified as plausible avulsion sites (Fig. 1A). Other avulsions within this region have been suggested by previous work (47). However, those phenomena cannot be ruled out as instances of cross-cutting, given the lack of chronologic data. Holocene channel belt avulsion sites were estimated in linear kilometers relative to the modern shoreline using Google Earth and rounded to the nearest 50 km. The sinuosity of the entire Lower Mississippi River is 1.9 (44); this value was used to approximate the avulsion lengths as measured along channels.

74,74,FL-2018-000105-BGD,No freedom fighters list before national polls - Dhaka Tribune,https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2018/04/03/no-freedom-fighters-list-national-polls,"Resumption of FF list work to take time

The work on preparing a list of freedom fighters will not take place during the remainder of the incumbent government’s tenure ahead of the national polls and the Freedom Fighters’ Central Command Council election. A new list will be made after the general election, said officials of the Liberation War Affairs Ministry and the Jatio Muktijoddha Council (Jamuka). On the other hand, the ministry has said that people accused of irregularities will not be part of the local scrutiny committees. New committees will be formed in areas where allegations of irregularities have been raised. An official of the ministry said that the government took initiative to prepare the list to provide facilities to the freedom fighters that were dropped from the previous lists and those who were never included in them. “We received about 170,000 applications online and later forwarded them to local committees for scrutiny. These committees recommended including more than 25,000 applicants in the list,” the official said. But later, the ministry started receiving complaints against many of these applications. Intelligence reports also found irregularities in the recommendations of the local committees. The process to prepare the list was halted on March 11. In the last 47 years, the list of freedom fighters has been amended six times. During the same period, changes have been brought 11 times to the process to define freedom fighters and their age. The National Freedom Fighters Council said a gazette was published on January 12 last year on forming 480 committees for scrutinizing freedom fighters. These committees started work on January 21 that year. Of them, 365 committees recommended 25,000 names for inclusion in the list. Liberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Haque has said that at least 100 of these committees provided faulty reports. “Most of them did not follow the guidelines we recommended for including freedom fighters in the list. Only 10% of the recommendations are correct. That’s why we have suspended activities of these committees,” he said. Meanwhile, a large number of freedom fighters have been thronging the Jatio Muktijoddha Council (Jamuka) with applications and appeals. One of them is Nawaz Ali, a resident of Brahmanbaria’s Bijoynagar upazila. “I fought in Sector 3. My father Modhu Mia was killed by the razakars. Once I received a grant of Tk20,000 from the prime minister as a freedom fighter. But the local union commander did not recommend my name due to a family feud. That is why I have come to file an appeal,” he said.Jamuka officials have said that the prime minister ordered preparation of the list to ensure that freedom fighters in need receive some facilities. But the process has been obstructed because of irregularities. Complaints began to flood in from various parts of the country as soon as work to prepare the list started. Local freedom fighters in Kurigram held a rally protesting the irregularities on December 21. They alleged that the local committee had made recommendations in exchange for money. The work of the scrutiny committees was suspended on March 11 mainly because of these allegations. Ministry sources say the government is not rushing to prepare a list because of the upcoming national polls and the central freedom fighters command election. The committees that have been accused of irregularities will be scrapped and work will resume with new committees in their places. The work will take time and the government is unwilling to take risks by hastily drawing up a list. Jamuka Director General Mizanur Rahman said they have stopped the work on the list based on specific allegations. “The committees ignored our request to provide information about freedom fighters in the categories we suggested. More clarity is needed. A decision will be taken later following a meeting,” he said. Mizanur said that an increase in facilities provided to the freedom fighters have enticed many people to be included the list. “Numerous people were included in the freedom fighter list during the previous [BNP-led] alliance government even though they did not take part in the Liberation War,” he said. Liberation War Affairs Minister Mozammel declined to comment when asked about the resumption of preparing the list. “The committee will decide on it after holding a meeting. We wanted to include the freedom fighters who were left out. We assumed that 10,000 to 15,000 freedom fighters would be included in the list. But the work could not be done with clarity,” he added. The minister further said: “We have information on the accused people. We will drop them when we form new local committees who will do the scrutiny.” This article was first published on banglatribune.com","Tue, 03 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2018/01/Photo-Pabna.jpg,"['list', 'minister', 'war', 'polls', 'freedom', 'committees', 'work', 'local', 'fighters', 'irregularities', 'ministry', 'national']", 
75,75,FL-2018-000105-BGD,When Facebook becomes 'the beast': Myanmar activists say social media aids genocide - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/06/asia/myanmar-facebook-social-media-genocide-intl/index.html,"(CNN) As tens of millions of Americans come to grips with revelations that data from Facebook may have been used to sway the 2016 presidential election, on the other side of the world, rights groups say hatemongers have taken advantage of the social network to widely disseminate inflammatory, anti-Muslim speech in Myanmar.

The rhetoric is aimed almost exclusively at the disenfranchised Rohingya Muslim minority, a group which has been the target of a sustained campaign of violence and abuse by the Myanmar military, which claims it is targeting terrorists.

Human rights activists inside the country and out tell CNN that posts range from recirculated news articles from pro-government outlets, to misrepresented or faked photos and anti-Rohingya cartoons.

A Rohingya refugee looks out from a school window at Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh's Ukhia district.

In response to the flood of hate-filled posts, a cross-Myanmar group of tech firms and NGOs has written an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, lambasting what they term the ""inadequate response of the Facebook team"" to escalating rhetoric on the platform in Myanmar.

Citing conversations the group says it unearthed on Facebook's Messenger service, which issue calls to arms against Muslims over a fabricated ""jihad"" planned for September 2017, it stated that the examples show ""clear examples of (Facebook) tools being used to incite real harm.

Facebook Messenger conversations, screenshotted and included with an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg from Myanmar tech companies.

""Far from being stopped, they spread in an unprecedented way, reaching country-wide and causing widespread fear and at least three violent incidents in the process.""

The letter cited an interview Zuckerberg did with Vox's Ezra Klein , in which he said Facebook's ""systems detected"" the hate speech. The letter surmised that by ""systems"" Zuckerberg meant the signatories of the letter -- third party vendors in Myanmar which, the letter admits, were ""far from systematic"" in their detection of hate speech.

Calling it ""the opposite of effective moderation,"" the group also chided Facebook for what it called a lack of proper mechanisms for emergency escalation, a reticence to engage local stakeholders and a lack of transparency.

Zuckerberg told Vox hate speech is ""a real issue, and we want to make sure that all of the tools that we're bringing to bear on eliminating hate speech, inciting violence, and basically protecting the integrity of civil discussions that we're doing in places like Myanmar, as well as places like the US that do get a disproportionate amount of the attention.""

Sudden surge

New research suggests Facebook played a key role as extremists sought to escalate the conflict in Myanmar.

Data analyst Raymond Serrato looked at posts from Myanmar citizens over the course of 2017, determining that there was a massive spike in hate-speech posts following an August military campaign in the country's western Rakhine state, home to the majority of the country's Rohingya.

The campaign was initially sparked when an insurgent group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, called for an uprising -- one which was easily quelled by the government.

The failed attempt led to the large-scale purge, which the UN has called ""ethnic cleansing,"" and a subsequent refugee crisis, which has seen 700,000 Rohingya forced from their homes and across the border into neighboring Bangladesh. Myanmar denies the intentional killing of civilians, and insists that operations targeted terrorists.

Serrato said he was ""surprised by the intensity"" and frequency of the anti-Rohingya posts.

""In August, when ARSA called on the Rohingya to rise up, (we were) surprised by the speed at which (anti-Rohingya voices) weaponized social media.""

Facebook has 'turned into a beast'

In March, Facebook was accused by the UN of ""substantively"" contributing to the ""level of acrimony"" against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.

Marzuki Darusman, the chair of a United Nations probe into human rights in Myanmar, said ""hate speech and incitement to violence on social media is rampant, particularly on Facebook"" and largely ""goes unchecked.""

His colleague, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, added that ""we know ultra-nationalist Buddhists... are really inciting a lot of violence and a lot of hatred against the Rohingya or other ethnic minorities.

""I'm afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast, and not what it originally intended"" to be, she said.

Instrument of 'hate and racism'

Human rights activist Zarni, who like some in the country, goes by only one name, told CNN the platform is neutral, but ""what is toxic is the state. (Lee) said Facebook has turned into a beast, (but in fact) the beasts are using Facebook.""

He says the main provocateurs are ""operating in very powerful institutions -- the military and monastic networks; the two major pillars of Burmese society."" Among the offenders, at least until his ban from the platform, was the infamous ultra-nationalist monk Wirathu.

Controversial Myanmar monk Wirathu speaking during an interview at a monastery in Myanmar's second biggest city of Mandalay.

In 2015, he told CNN that Muslims ""take many wives and they have many children. And when their population grows they threaten us."" ""And,"" he concluded, ""they are violent.""

Thaw Parka, a spokesman for Ma Ba Tha, a Buddhist nationalist group associated with the controversial monk, says critics ""cherry pick (Wirathu's) extreme words.""

A Facebook spokesperson told Reuters it suspends and sometimes removes anyone that ""consistently shares content promoting hate,"" in response to a question about Wirathu's account.

Others are not letting the social media giant off the hook. It would be ""superficial"" to ""ignore the conflict between ethnicities,"" Serrato says, ""but Facebook has definitely facilitated it.""

Jes Kaliebe Petersen, CEO of Myanmar-based startup accelerator Phandeeyar, says while there is a lot of racist content shared on the platform, ""there are also moderate voices that are doing good work not only countering this but spreading moderate narrative, but ""get drowned out.""

New users, new problems

Myanmar's relative callowness in engaging online is part of the reason the rhetoric has exploded, and been so influential.

The country experienced a ""digital leapfrog effect,"" says Petersen. ""Until 2014, there was less than 5% mobile phone penetration, but overnight, SIM cards were offered for (as little as) $1.50,"" allowing a much greater number of people to buy smartphones.

Myanmar has a ""whole new generation of internet users, just coming to terms with what you can do online,"" he says.

Facebook's ubiquity in the country -- the UN's Darusman says, in Myanmar, ""social media is Facebook, and Facebook is social media"" -- only serves to multiply hate speech's virality.

Activist Sein Thein says the burden of responsibility for the online rhetoric should not fall entirely on Facebook's shoulders, and that Myanmar's citizens ""need to be mature"" when they are online.

Facebook: We're combating hate

In order to combat the platform being used for hate speech against the Muslim minority, Facebook said it has ""invested significantly in technology and local language expertise"" in Myanmar following the UN accusations.

""There is no place for hate speech or content that promotes violence on Facebook, and we work hard to keep it off our platform,"" a spokesperson told CNN.

The spokesperson said the company has worked with experts in Myanmar for several years to produce a community standards page for Myanmar ""and regular training sessions for civil society and local community groups across the country.""

It is hard for Facebook to monitor the rise of hate speech in the country, Petersen says, partly due to language difficulties.

""There's an intention to enforce them but it's not being followed."" Petersen says his company, Phandeeyar, helped Facebook translate its community standards into Burmese.

In response to the March UN accusations, Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay said his government and Facebook are ""promoting cooperation and coordination for the Myanmar people to understand the community standards of Facebook.""

On Facebook he said supporters of the Rohingya were also using social media to ""spread... disinformation around the world.""

The group that sent the open letter to Zuckerberg, co-signed by Phandeeyar, urged the tech mogul ""to invest more into moderation -- particularly in countries, such as Myanmar, where Facebook has rapidly come to play a dominant role in how information is accessed and communicated.""

Long history

Zarni says the country has a ""long ideological tradition by which genocides are acceptable,"" which can partially be explained by support of the enemies of the then-British empire, including the Nazis, in resistance to British rule in the 1930s and 40s.

""I came from that society, I grew up with it. In the 1930s, we were quoting Hitler left and right in Burma,"" he said, using the colonial-era name for the country.

""What really has emboldened the Burmese public behavior in terms of their social media interactions is the military -- the military has taken up an entirely new function, it's not only the (defense of what it sees as its) territory, but defense of culture, society, religion and race.""

Silence condemned

The country's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has been criticized for her silence in the face of the country's treatment of the minority.

""She will not do anything (to defend the Rohingya) -- she struggled more than 15 years to get this position,"" Rohingya rights defender Nay San Lwin says.

77,77,FL-2018-000105-BGD,Bhutan’s balancing act - thethirdpole.net,https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/energy/bhutans-balancing-act/,"Bhutan is caught in an increasingly fragile balancing act. The country aims to build 10-12,000 MW of hydropower – mostly for export to India. These dams are the bedrock of its economy and part of ambitious plans to stay a “carbon negative” nation.

Meanwhile, concerns are growing around the impact of dams on Bhutan’s biodiversity and pristine forests, on the local society and economy. Experts also question the safety of building so many projects in the fragile mountains of the Himalayas – particularly as the country shifts from light impact run-of-the-river dams, to larger scale reservoir dams.

Dawa Gyelmo spoke to Chhewang Rinzin, the managing director of Bhutan’s Druk Green Power Corporation, who recently received a contract extension in this very important position, about how the country can navigate its way through these murky waters.

The Third Pole (TTP): What are the environment costs of Bhutan’s dams? How will they affect vulnerable species?

Chhewang Rinzin (CR): Bhutan’s National Environment Commission (NEC) has some of the strictest guidelines on all activities associated with the construction of hydropower projects. These guidelines are in keeping with best international practices.

Of particular interest in Bhutan is the preservation of the habitats for the endangered white bellied herons and the golden mahseer. The [developers behind the] Punatsangchhu hydropower projects and the government are aware of the need to preserve their habitats and investments are being made to implement mitigation measures in the form of hatcheries and conservation centres.

There are emerging questions on the need to align project specific requirements to the larger national priorities. Dams and hydropower projects are being built to fulfill certain socio-economic development needs of the people who aspire for a better future. Water and energy security are also becoming critical considerations. The preservation of its pristine ecosystems and environment is at the core of Bhutan’s sustainable development policy. Unless the environment concerns are addressed appropriately, confidence in hydropower projects could be eroded. A balanced approach to development is something that Bhutan is pursuing with some success.

TTP: While Bhutan’s dams are run-of-the-river, the cement tunnels through which the water flows have some impact on the river bank, destroy the biodiversity of the river, and also interrupt the breeding patterns of fish. What actions are being taken to deal with this?

CR: Over the last couple of decades, there has been a lot of discussion on what should constitute the level of environmental flows [the amount of water in a river] and how to preserve fish habitats and migration should a dam get built. There is also a growing acceptance of the need for catchment area “cumulative” environmental assessments and mitigation measures, rather than project specific assessments and measures.

A first attempt to provide a fish ladder has been made for the Kurichhu project. The fish ladder is a success in that there is fish migration, but the adequacy of the fish ladder will need to be ascertained. Considering the deep and steep ravines, fish ladders might not always be a solution. In the Punatsangchhu and Mangdechhu projects, concerted efforts and investments are being made to specifically address such concerns.

In the case of the Tala and Dagachhu projects, the streams flowing into the rivers just below the dams are, for the moment, considered sufficient for catering to the minimum flows required to safeguard biodiversity downstream of the dams. Bhutan is in the process of adopting minimum environmental flow regimes to be released from the dams notwithstanding such other inflows into the rivers downstream of the dams.

Bhutan only has four operating dams at present with three more under construction. Of course, there are more dams under consideration. Other countries have made successful ventures out of using dams and reservoirs for fisheries. By any international standards, Bhutan is ensuring that all efforts and investments are being made into preserving the riverine biodiversity that might otherwise be affected by its dams.

TTP: What are the impacts of climate change on Bhutan’s dams?

CR: Climate change is unlikely to affect the physical aspects of Bhutan’s dams. Today’s design and engineering of dams take into consideration seismicity, glacier melt, and flash floods. But having said that, it is a grave concern that global warming and climate change could impact hydrological flows in the rivers and this could subsequently impact the electricity generation and therefore the economic viability of investments made in hydropower projects. It is definitely observed that the glaciers are receding and snowfall during the winter months is rare.

There is a lot of interest as to what happens to the Third Pole [the glaciers in the Himalayan region contain the most ice after the South and North Pole] with global warming and climate change. Recent studies (including the IPCC report) predict that the monsoons might actually bring more rains and that there could actually be an overall increase in river discharges. The monsoons, however, might be quite intense and there could be a risk of cloud bursts and flash floods, which could lead to natural disasters.

A forecast of more intense monsoons and higher discharge makes a strong case for dams with reservoirs in the long term. While the June 2013 cloudburst and ensuring disasters in Uttarakhand is often blamed on dams, sometimes we forget that had the Tehri dam not been there, the disaster could have been much more severe downstream of the Tehri dam.

During Cyclone Aila in May 2009, the Wangchhu river also swelled suddenly from 31 cubic metres per second (cumecs) to 2,415 cumecs as depicted below at the Tala dam.

Had a dam like Tehri been built on the Wangchhu, much of the damage downstream might have been averted. Large dams with reservoirs also have multiple benefits beyond water and energy security such as flood control, irrigation, tourism, fisheries and navigation.

TTP: Given how fragile the mountain ranges are, is it safe to have too many dams on one river? For example Punatsangchhu River, which already has two major dams and Sunkosh is also planned.

CR: Looking at developed countries in Europe and in the Americas, construction of dams in a cascade does not seem to create actual physical problems with the dams. In actuality, these developed countries use a cascade of such dams to manage river discharges in a manner to optimize water availability for energy generation, drinking water, irrigation, fisheries, navigation, flood control, and meet the environmental flow requirements for the downstream flora and fauna. While a few older dams are being decommissioned, many more new dams are being built in these countries.

Bhutan only has a few dams today. But of course, we are now building the Punatshangchhu 1 and 2, the Mangdechhu and the Kholongchhu projects. These are all run-of-river schemes. It is planned to build the Sankosh project that would create the first reservoir in Bhutan. The detailed project reports for the Kuri Gongri are being taken up. A pre-feasibility study has been completed for the Manas project.

Care must be taken to ensure that the dams are designed, engineered and constructed so that they do not fail. The safety and integrity of the dams being built in Bhutan receive a lot of attention to ensure every safeguard against all eventualities, and consideration given to seismicity and the young and fragile Himalayan geology.

TTP: Bhutan has seen constant, high, flooding in recent years? If one dam is flooded, how will it affect other dams on the same river?

Over the period where records are available, Bhutan has experienced normal floods. Even the floods following Cyclone Aila in 2009 could be considered as a recurrence of past floods. In an age of information, such floods are otherwise being construed as high compared to earlier ones, but the data does not support such conjecture.

Recorded hydrological data does not show any significant changes in the river discharges as depicted below for the Wangchhu over the last decade.

The dams in Bhutan are being built to cater to much higher levels of probable maximum floods considering the probability of a glacier lake outburst. In case of, god forbid, a dam failure, the management of river discharge could be much better coordinated within a cascade of dams.

Normal floods, of course, would be easier to regulate [with dams]. Should there be an extreme flood for which the dams are not able to provide storage for, there would be flooding downstream with or without dams.

TTP: The Indian government has said that they have a power surplus. With such statements coming from the only electricity importer of Bhutan, what is your plan? Will the electricity market be hampered?

CR: India has recently enjoyed a surplus in electricity generation with even some small exports to Bangladesh and to Nepal. However, India still has a huge demand coupled with its plans for a very vibrant economy. India’s energy capacity demand is projected to reach 1,250,000 MW by 2030 while generation capacity might touch only 725,000 MW by then. India is also pursuing a very aggressive wind and solar policy under its commitment to renewable energy to combat global warming and climate change. India will need all the hydropower capacity that Bhutan could generate, if not for the base load, then definitely for meeting the huge balancing power requirements for a stable grid with solar and wind power.

Considering India’s emerging energy markets, Bhutan is slightly shifting its priorities away from run-of-river to reservoir schemes. Sankosh and Kuri Gongri are reservoir schemes that could complement India’s investments in solar and wind renewables. Whatever Bhutan could inject into the Indian grid from its realistic 10,000-12,000 MW generation capacity addition by 2030 would be a very small proportion. The present generation surplus in India is therefore unlikely to hamper the market for Bhutan’s hydropower.

With talks on sub-regional and regional grid integration, there could also be opportunities for Bhutan’s electricity to flow elsewhere, especially Bangladesh.

TTP: The major part of Bhutan’s debt burden comes from building the dams. How quickly will it be dealt with?

The hydropower sector sustains the Bhutanese economy on its own. The loans are serviced from the revenues from electricity sales. The Chhukha and Kurichhu loans have already been paid off. The loan for the Tala project will be liquidated by the end of 2018.

The government has never had to intervene and inject funds to service the debt financing provided to these hydropower projects. On the contrary, today revenues in the form of taxes and dividends from the hydropower sector accounts for at least 27% of the revenues to the government.

With more hydropower projects under construction, there is of course the growing level of debt. There is also concern that the mode of financing has changed somewhat with increasing debt vis-à-vis the grant component for projects that are financed by the Government of India, which is by far the biggest partner in Bhutan’s hydropower development. There is also concern that some of the projects are delayed and project costs are escalating. Still, when compared to similar hydropower projects built in India and elsewhere, the costs are comparable and therefore Bhutan’s hydropower should continue to be able to service the loans and pay taxes and declare dividends to the government. After all, these are commercial investments being made in hydropower.

TTP: Should Bhutan look at other options, including micro hydro projects, or solar, for villages off the grid, which also have limited environmental impact?

CR: Bhutan has been extremely successful in reaching grid extension and electricity supply to even the remotest parts of the country. Over 99.7% of the households in Bhutan have access to grid power supply. Therefore, there is no need for Bhutan to pursue micro hydro projects or solar or for that matter wind for providing off-grid power supply as in the case of some other countries in the region. While costs of solar PV have been falling, cost of electricity from wind and micro hydro continues to remain high. In Bhutan, grid supply remains the cheapest source of electricity.

In a few of the very remote areas where grid supply is not possible and could have environmental impact due to long transmission lines, micro hydro still continues to be explored but that is limited to just a few locations.

TTP: What is the future of hydropower for Bhutan?

CR: With the evolving energy markets in India and the region, and the priorities being placed on developing wind and solar resources in the region, the opportunity for Bhutan’s hydropower will always be there. There is definitely a need to give more priority to reservoir schemes to meet the balancing power that the evolving energy markets would need in the future. There is also a need to continue to remain tariff competitive against other forms of energy. Therefore, Bhutan will need to continue to ensure timely completion of projects and within reasonable costs.

There is also a need to consider a wider benefit from the hydropower sector to the Bhutanese at large – from employment to contracts to supplies – especially during the construction stages.

While Bhutan considers hydropower the cornerstone of its economy, there is the need to further diversify its economic base and also diversify within the hydropower sector to add value and to generate employment.

Above all else, Bhutan needs to consider hydropower development at a pace that it is comfortable with and along the way, ensure that its people derive the maximum benefits from this very important resource long into the future. This will mean the sustainable harnessing of the hydropower resource that will depend largely on how Bhutan manages its watersheds and protects and preserves its pristine environment and eco-systems.","Wed, 28 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thethirdpole.net/content/uploads/2016/11/Bhutan-dam-CR.jpg,"['hydropower', 'bhutans', 'river', 'bhutan', 'grid', 'balancing', 'projects', 'act', 'energy', 'dams', 'india', 'need']",

DU Vice-chancellor Professor Md Akhtaruzzaman confirm the matter and said: ""He has been temporally suspended from all academic and administrative activities for distorting the history of the Liberation War and making offensive remarks about Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in his article titled 'Jyotirmoy Zia' published in a national daily on March 26,"" reports UNB. In his article, Morshed claimed Ziaur Rahman, founder of BNP, was the man who declared independence during the Liberation War and also also claimed that Awami League leaders including Sheikh Mujibur Rahman left the country during the time, leaving the country in turmoil. Prof Morshed cited a number of former Indian politicians, including Indira Gandhi and Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, to support his claims. The article was published in Bangla daily newspaper Naya Diganta. Prof Morshed is the assistant training affairs secretary of the Executive Committee of BNP.After the article was published, Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) last Tuesday declared the professor “persona non grata” on campus and submitted a memorandum to the vice-chancellor demanding his suspension. Dhaka University Teachers Association (DUTA) also demanded his resignation. As a part of the protest, Chhatra League activists burnt an effigy of the professor and a copy of the Naya Diganta newspaper. However, the Dhaka Tribune found that a version of the article was earlier published in the daily Jai Jai Din on January 19. In this earlier version, there was no mention of who declared independence or Bangabandhu’s escape, and the citations from former Indian politicians were also missing. When contacted, Prof Morshed Hasan Khan said he had sent the same version of the story to both Naya Diganta and Jai Jai Din on the same day, though the former may have saved the story to publish it on Independence Day. He further said that the current situation had arisen as a result of a misunderstanding between him and the newspapers. “I have already withdrawn the article, and had no intention to humiliate him (Sheikh Mujibur Rahman),” Prof Morshed added. The professor also issued an apology on Facebook following the Chhatra League protest. Naya Diganta has removed the article from their website. When the Dhaka Tribune tried to contact him about his temporary suspension, Professor Morshed was unreachable.","Mon, 02 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2018/04/DU-Prof-Morshed-Hasan-Khan_Facebook.jpg,"['article', 'rahman', 'defaming', 'sheikh', 'morshed', 'naya', 'suspended', 'professor', 'prof', 'mujibur', 'du', 'published', 'allegedly', 'league', 'bangabandhu']",

While trains carrying passengers and goods run between the two countries, this is the first container service.

According to the Indian Express, the 30-container train will carry food grains and other materials in its maiden run from Kolkata to the west station of the Bangabandhu Bridge in Bangladesh.

Exporters' forums from both countries had long been lobbying for container trains as they could save time and cut trade costs significantly apart from making trade safer and more organized.

Container trains are usually used to ferry machine parts, chemicals, automobiles and consumer durables that involve a shorter transit time.

“Once established, the movement of container cargo is expected to transform the logistics pattern of movement of goods between the two countries,” Railway Board Member (traffic) Mohammad Jamshed told The Indian Express.

The thrust for the Bangladesh-India route for container movement comes even as Pakistan has put a spanner in the ambitious plan of a similar container movement from Dhaka to Istanbul through Pakistan and Iran, despite all parties being on board under the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the route being ready.

Pakistan has refused to agree to container movement through the Attari border since last year citing security concerns.","Tue, 03 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2015/03/7-photo_6-copy.jpg,"['indian', 'trade', 'route', 'begins', 'trial', 'countries', 'trains', 'dhakakolkata', 'train', 'movement', 'run', 'container', 'pakistan']",

Habiganj Superintendent of Police (SP) Bidhan Tripura formed the panel on Thursday with Additional SP ASM Shamsur Rahman Bhuiyan as its head. The two other members of the committee were Baniachong circle Additional SP Shoilen Chakma and Sadar circle Assistant SP Rabiul Islam. The probe team was asked to submit its findings within three working days, Bidhan said.

Babul then raped Beauty numerous times holding her hostage in unknown places for a month. Last month, after Babul let Beauty go, her father had filed an abduction and rape case against the rapist and his mother, a member of Brahmandora Union Parishad, at the district’s Woman and Children Repression Prevention Tribunal on March 1. As Babul started to threaten Beauty's family to withdraw the case, she was sent to her grandfather's house at Gunipur village in Lakhai upazila. On the night of March 16, Babul reportedly abducted Beauty again from there and raped her before killing her. Police recovered her body from the haor area in Shayestaganj the next day. The incident had created a widespread outcry among people when a photograph of her body lying on a field went viral on Facebook. On March 18, Beauty’s father Sayed filed the murder case accusing Babul and several unknown others at Shayestaganj police station.

Indonesian parents and an autism support group have accused the government of not doing enough to help a growing number of autistic children in the country.

They said many autistic children are abandoned by their parents, and at the very least, the government should provide rehabilitation centers and care homes for them.

According to Statistic Central Agency, there are 1.5 million children with autism in Indonesia.

""The Indonesian government has shown good intent through seminars, but in practice it has done very little such as provide cheap therapy centers,"" according to Melly Budhiman, chairwoman of the Indonesian Autism Foundation.

She was speaking at a gathering at the National Monument in Jakarta, on April 1, at the start of a publicity campaign to seek government support and make Indonesian society more aware of the condition.

There is a misunderstanding about the condition in Indonesia, she said.

Autism is a condition where a child suffers developmental delays and is not a disease, which means these children desperately need to undergo therapy, she explained.

There are autistic people who are brilliant academically and go on to become doctors, archaeologists or whatever. But those with low intelligence quotient (IQ) need special treatment, she said.

She called on the Ministry of Social Affairs to provide therapy, work training and even care homes for those abandoned by parents who could not cope with raising an autistic child.

""Parents can't pay for private therapy centers because it's expensive so the government should provide them,"" she said.","Wed, 04 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ucanews.com/uploads/2018/04/1522745329.jpg,"['care', 'therapy', 'provide', 'autism', 'autistic', 'parents', 'govt', 'centers', 'ignoring', 'children', 'indonesian', 'support']",

Sonali Bank has filed twelve cases against Bangladesh Bank, seeking reimbursement for the funds debited by the central bank from its account in connection to the Hallmark financial scam incident. The Hallmark scam took place at Sonali Bank’s Ruposhi Bangla branch between 2010 and 2012. The central bank had to pay out Tk892 crore to other banks and used funds debited from Sonali Bank’s account to do so. According to several officials from Sonali Bank, the cases were filed recently with Dhaka’s first joint district judge’s Court, and more cases are set to be lodged soon. The Sonali Bank is currently seeking a repayment of Tk71.57 crore from the Bangladesh Bank. Speaking to the Dhaka Tribune, Sonali Bank’s panel lawyer Jahangir Alam said: “Despite my client’s objection, the central bank had debited Sonali Bank’s funds and gave them to other banks. “However, investigations carried out by both the central bank and Sonali Bank have revealed evidence of many irregularities.” According to Sonali Bank officials, the central bank had debited Tk892 crores from the bank’s account. The Sonali bank filed the cases against the Bangladesh Bank stating that the deduction was illegal, as the central bank in its own investigation found that Hallmark used fraudulent means to obtain those loans. The central bank had previously mentioned that other banks will reimburse Sonali Bank’s funds if tangible evidence supporting the scam allegation is found. Case documents at a glance In its case statements, the bank mentioned that a major credit scam such as Hallmark occurred, due to the central bank’s inability to properly supervise the Ruposhi Bangla branch of Sonali Bank. The statement further read that the central bank must repay the money back with interest. The bank had also sent repeated requests to the central bank not to debit funds from its account several times, but received no response. One of the 12 cases was filed seeking a reimbursement of Tk4.6 crores. Along with Bangladesh Bank, Jamuna Bank Ltd, Islami Bank Ltd, National Bank Ltd, Dutch Bangla Bank Ltd, Eastern Bank Ltd, Prime Bank Ltd, Southeast Bank Ltd, and Basic Bank Ltd have been named in the case. Suspended Sonali Bank officials and authorities of a number of companies have also been accused. Another case was filed seeking a repayment of Tk1.37 crore. In that case, the central bank, Hallmark, Al-Arafah Islami Bank Ltd, Jamuna Bank Ltd, Mutual Trust Bank Ltd, National Bank Ltd, Prime Bank Ltd, Trust Bank Ltd, Woori Bank, and a number of suspended officers of Sonali Bank were named. The other ten cases also have many of the above mentioned banks and companies named as the accused. Sonali Bank filed its first case over the matter on February 28 this year, and two cases were filed that day. Two more cases were filed on March 7, two on March 11, one on March 12, three on March 14, and two on March 18.The documents of one of the cases, which was filed seeking a reimbursement of Tk4.6 crore, stated that on January, 2008, Dress Me Fashion Ltd opened a current account with the Sonali Bank’s Hotel Sheraton Corporate branch. Dress Me applied for a loan with the Sonali Bank with facilities such as cash letter of credit, back to back letter of credit, and shipment cash credit loan for importing garment machinery and export garments products. Following the application submitted by Dress Me Fashion Ltd Managing Director Md Tawhid Hossain, Sonali Bank head office approved the loan through the Hotel Sheraton Corporate branch. The company enjoyed the highest credit limit of Tk16 crores and PSC limit of Tk1.60 crore. The company applied again for LCs to import band new machinery. Dress Me Fashion later requested the branch manager to open a number of the LCs without depositing any margin money. The bank also opened back to back LCs, but the company did not pay the due amount. Chairperson of Dress Me Fashion Jinat Fatema, MD Tawhid Hossain, and Director Md Taslim Hassan also took out multiple loans amounting to crores of taka using several front companies, such as T and Brothers Nit Composite Ltd, Spartek Ltd, and LNS Accessories. Later the company made fabricated documents to misappropriate the funds. The case document further stated that several officers of Sonali Bank’s Sheraton branch helped the company make fabricated documents at a rented apartment near the bank. The act of preparing fabricated documents took place on nights or weekends when the branch was closed. They used the names of front companies such as AG Trading, Apparel 21 Ltd, Arif Nit spin Ltd, Hossain Dyeing and Printing Mills Ltd, NRG Composite Yarn Dyeing, NRG Composite Spinning Mills Ltd, Saleha Printing, and Trade Mode Trimming. None of these companies had any offices or factories. In October of 2012, Bangladesh Bank exposed the scam, which became infamous as the Hallmark financial scam, involving funds amounting to Tk3,700 crores. Criminal cases were filed in this connection. This particular case statement stated that Sonali Bank had sent six letters to the Bangladesh Bank requesting it not to make payments against the non-funded liability of the bill. However, Bangladesh Bank made payments amounting to Tk3.13 crores from Sonali Bank’s account to Jamuna Bank Ltd, Islami Bank Ltd, Dutch-Bangla Bank Ltd, Eastern Bank Ltd, Prime Bank Ltd, Southeast Bank Ltd, and Basic Bank Ltd, despite knowing the facts that the loan documents were false.","Thu, 05 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2018/04/20180129-Mehedi-Hasan00077.jpg,"['banks', 'filed', 'case', 'funds', 'reimbursement', 'bangladesh', 'tk71cr', 'bank', 'branch', 'seeks', 'sonali', 'cases', 'central']",

MVRDV won a competition organised by urban redeveloper Zeestad to create the public landmark for the municipality of Den Helder with its proposal SeaSaw.

The brief called for a structure to give the area a ""sense of identity"" and foster a better visual connection with the Wadden Sea, which is obscured by a defensive dike that keeps flood waters at bay.

The walkway, which will be lens-shaped in profile, will cantilever from the ground in opposing directions to create a pair of landings.

""The SeaSaw for Den Header is a memorable, undulating public art installation which responds to its context and history, while literally representing the dynamics of the sea in its infinite movement,"" said a statement from MVRDV co-founder Jacob van Rijs.

""The installation respects the existing dike whilst allowing visitors and inhabitants to experience both city and sea from a whole new perspective.""

The Wadden Sea is a UNESCO World Heritage site most recognised for its tidal mudflats, which attract vast amounts of migrating birds each year. Its waters also run through parts of Germany and Denmark, where last year Copenhagen practice Dorte Mandrup completed a thatched visitors centre for the region in Ribe.

The walkway is designed to rock like a seesaw, but the exact workings are yet to be confirmed.

""The movement is an aspect of the design that is still under development and investigation of feasibility,"" a spokesperson for the studio told Dezeen.

""The system to create the movement could either be an electrical/mechanic system with plungers, or it could be done by literally shifting weight from one side to the other,"" they continued. ""As said this is still in a research phase and it needs to be seen if this feature will be integrated or not.""

As well as erecting The SeaSaw, the project will also see MVRDV create a five-kilometre pathway for walking, cycling and hiking parallel to the dike.

The architects hope the route will further ""activate the seafront"", encouraging visitors to climb the barrier and enjoy different perspectives of the landscape.

MVRDV will work alongside Dutch engineers IMD to construct the viewpoint, which is set for completion in 2019.

The practice is also currently working on an office building in Germany that will feature an interactive mirrored facade, and a constructivist-inspired tower block in Moscow.

Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, two detained Reuters journalists, returned to a Yangon courtroom on March 28 for the latest hearing in their trial for handling ""secret documents"" related to security operations in Myanmar's northern Rakhine State.

The pair had been investigating the killing of 10 Rohingya men at a village in Maungdaw Township, a chilling expose the wire service published in February.

They face potential charges under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.

At the hearing, Wa Lone made an appeal to Myanmar's new president Win Myint to work for their release and ""bring about media freedom for the press.""

""We are now in Insein prison just because we covered the news. We have to go to court because we discovered [examples of] injustice,"" said Wa Lone.

The pair have been incarcerated for over three months. Former US president Bill Clinton and current UN secretary-general Antonio Gutteres are among a raft of high-profile figures who been calling for their release.

The case has drawn attention to how press freedom is backsliding in Myanmar, particularly since the civilian government led by State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi came to power two years ago.

Optimism fades

It wasn't long ago that Myanmar was regarded as a shining light in terms of press freedom in Southeast Asia.

After decades of isolated military rule, real democratic reform began in 2011 under the administration of former general Thein Sein. After the high-profile release of political prisoners and the cancellation of a controversial billion-dollar hydropower project in the country's north, one of Thein Sein's most significant early reforms was abolishing decades of pre-publication censorship.

In August 2012, the country’s Press Scrutiny and Registration Department, which had existed in various forms since the early days of military rule in 1964, was eliminated.

Then, in early 2013, daily publications were granted licenses to operate for the first time. Overnight, dozens of independent daily publications could be seen on Yangon’s streets.

But that was about as good as things got.

In July 2014, a court in central Myanmar sentenced four journalists and the chief executive of the now-defunct Unity journal to 10 years' hard labor.

Months earlier, the publication had run a front-page story claiming a factory in the town of Pakokku was being used by the military to manufacture chemical weapons — a charge the military denied.

The Unity Five, as they became known, were released in April 2016 under a presidential amnesty.

""Since the end of 2014, media reforms in Myanmar have stalled,"" said Edgardo Legaspi, executive director of the Southeast Asia Press Alliance.

""The reforms put in place by the then-quasi-military government under Thein Sein reached their limit with the arrest of journalists,"" he said, referring to the Unity reporters.

""We had hoped reforms would resume after the NLD [National League for Democracy] won the election in November 2015, but we have been very disappointed.""

A new threat

The backsliding on press freedom has been a hot topic since the NLD came to power. One of the most notorious examples has been the increased use of a vaguely worded clause used to incarcerate people — specifically, journalists and civilians — for ""online defamation.""

Meanwhile, the Telecommunications Law was enacted in 2013 with the aim of monitoring the telco industry, which was emerging from a decades-long state-run monopoly.

But tagged onto this new legislation was a little-known clause, section 66(d), which provides up to three years in prison for ""extorting, coercing, restraining wrongfully, defaming, disturbing, causing undue influence or threatening any person using a telecommunications network.""

Under the Thein Sein administration, which ended in March 2016, 11 cases were raised under 66(d), according to data collected by Athan, a free speech advocacy group.

In the two years since the NLD came to power, more than 100 cases have come to light under the clause, the research shows. About a quarter involve journalists.

""The situation has not improved, they [the government] still use 66(d) to protect themselves from criticism from opposition forces,"" said Maung Saungkha, executive director of Athan.

He spent six months behind bars for violating the same clause by writing a poem deemed critical of Thein Sein.

""Article 66(d) is not suited to the Telecommunications Law and is vaguely worded,"" said Maung Saungkha.

""It doesn’t meet international standards on freedom of expression and is confusing for people,"" he said, adding that Myanmar’s Penal Code already has a provision against defamation.

Climate of fear

This has caused frayed nerves among journalists operating in the country and tension has grown since the uptick in violence in Rakhine State in August.

The trigger for that was a series of attacks by fighters from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA).

The military responded with a heavy-handed crackdown and in the ensuing months an estimated 700,000 Rohingya fled across the border into Bangladesh.

The international community has accused the army of using disproportionate force in its operation — including charges of ethnic cleansing — but officers and government officials claim they are conducting a legitimate clearance operation.

Set against this context, Myanmar journalist Aung Naing Soe was arrested alongside two international journalists and their driver last October while reporting in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw.

They were charged under the 1934 Anti-Aircraft Law and accused of flying a drone near parliament before they were released in December.

""We thought we would have press freedom but you can be in danger if you write something that makes the government or a public figure look bad,"" Aung Naing Soe told ucanews.com. ""Especially under this government, we are seeing more cases that oppose freedom of expression.""

He said reporters in the country face significant pressure to toe the line, citing the case involving the Reuters journalists.

""But we have to keep doing our job, and we will,"" he said.

""We also have to take care of each other, like speaking up on behalf of our friends who are in danger due to their work.

""Journalists, and especially foreign ones, are portrayed as public enemies and are accused of selling the country’s information. This can make the situation worse. Journalists are just doing their jobs, and the public should stand up for the press.""","Wed, 11 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ucanews.com/uploads/2018/04/1522824766.jpg,"['siege', 'journalists', 'freedom', 'soe', 'reforms', 'military', 'thein', 'aung', 'wanes', 'media', 'myanmar', 'rohingya', 'press']",

Telecom and ICT Minister Mustafa Jabbar placed the proposed law before the House, which was sent to the parliamentary standing committee on the ministry concerned for scrutinising it. The committee had also been asked to submit a report to parliament within four weeks.

“One of the main objectives of the proposed law is to ensure the country's security from digital crimes and ensure security of people's lives and assets,” the minister said while placing the bill.

Different quarters, including Shampadak Parishad, an organisation of editors of the country's national dailies, Newspapers Owners' Association of Bangladesh, senior journalists, rights activists and ambassadors of different countries in Dhaka expressed deep concern over the proposed law, specially over the inclusion of the controversial section 57 of the ICT Act and some strict provisions in the Digital Security Bill.

They also demanded that the Digital Security Bill be finalised following discussions among all stakeholders, saying that the law should not be enacted hastily.

The government on several occasions said section 57 of the ICT Act would be removed that deals with defamation, hurting religious sentiments, causing deterioration of law and order and instigating against any person or organisation through publishing or transmitting any material in websites or in electronic form. It stipulates maximum 14 years in prison for the offences.

The Digital Security Bill-2018 splits these offences into four separate sections (21, 25, 28 and 29) with punishment ranging from three to 10 years' jail term.

Amid growing concern, several ministers had assured the journalist community not to worry about the Digital Security Bill, saying that all stakeholders would be consulted before getting it passed.

The cabinet on January 29 approved the draft Act.

Journalists and rights defenders fear the freedom of the press and expression was put to the sword due to the proposed law. They also observed that there would be every chance of the proposed law being misused against people's right to express themselves.

WHAT THE DRAFT LAW SAYS

Section 21 of the proposed law says anyone spreading negative propaganda against the Liberation War or the Father of the Nation, using digital devices or instigates to do so, will risk being sentenced up to 14 years in jail or a fine of up to Tk 1 crore or both.

He or she will face up to life sentence or Tk 3 crore in fine or both for committing the offence for the second time, it said.

Section 25 says a person may face up to three years in jail or Tk 3 lakh in fine or both if he or she is found to have deliberately published or broadcast in a website or electronic form -- something which is attacking or intimidating or which can make someone dishonest or disgruntled; knowingly publish or broadcast false and distorted (full or partial) information to annoy or humiliate someone; knowingly publish or broadcast false and distorted (full or partial) information to tarnish the image of the state or to spread rumour.

A person will face up to five years in jail or Tk 10 lakh or both for committing the offence for the second time, it said.

Section 28 says a person may face up to seven years in jail or Tk 10 lakh in fine or both if he or she is found to have deliberately published or broadcast something in the website or in electronic form or get it done to hurt one's religious sentiment and values.

A person will face up to 10 years in jail or Tk 20 lakh or both for committing the offence for the second time, it said.

Section 29 says a person may face maximum three years in jail or Tk 5 lakh in fine or both if he or she commits offence stipulated in section 499 of the Penal Code through website or in electronic form.

He or she will face up to five years in jail or Tk 10 lakh in fine or both for committing the offence for the second time, it said.

Section 31 says a person may face up to seven years in jail or Tk 5 lakh in fine or both if he or she is found to have deliberately published or broadcast something in the website or in electronic form which can spread hatred and create enmity among different groups and communities and can cause deterioration of law and order.

Punishment will be up to 10 years in jail or Tk 10 lakh in fine or both for committing the offence for the second time, it said.

According to section 32 of the proposed law, a person may face up to 14 years in jail or Tk 25 lakh in fine or both on charges of computer spying or digital spying if he or she illegally enters the offices of government, semi-government, autonomous or statutory bodies and collect or preserve or send any top secret or secret documents through a computer, digital device, computer network, digital network or any electronic form and help others to do that.

He or she will face imprisonment of up to a life sentence or Tk 1 crore in fine or both for committing the crimes for the second time.

A person may face up to 14 years in jail or Tk 1 crore or both for hacking, section 34 of the bill says.

SOME OTHER PROVISIONS

According to the proposed law, the government will form a Digital Security Agency to ensure national digital security and combating cyber crimes. A director general will lead the body.

To discuss the overall digital security of the country and to take “nationally important decision” over the issue, there will be a National Digital Security Council headed by the prime minister, the draft law reads.

The government, through a gazette notification, will declare some specific computer systems, networks and information infrastructures, as “Essential Information Infrastructures” to serve the purpose of the proposed act.

NO NEED FOR ARREST WARRANT

As per section 43 of the draft law, a police official can search or arrest anyone without any warrant issued by a court.

If a police officer believes that an offence under the proposed law has been committed in a certain place or is being committed, or there is a possibility of crimes, or there is a possibility of destroying evidence, he or she can search the place or any person present there.","Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/57_4.jpg?itok=ICRH2JvC,"['js', 'tk', 'fine', 'concern', 'placed', 'security', 'face', 'digital', 'law', 'jail', 'person', 'lakh', 'proposed', 'amid', 'bill']",

The dam, built at an estimated cost of Rs 588 crore, washed away the hopes of people living in Malsisar, Khetri, Jhunjhunu, Sikar and 1473 other surrounding villages who were waiting for it to quench their thirst from the Indira Gandhi canal water.

The village surrounding the dam Kakreyu submerged in water flowing thick and fast from the dam. The district administration and police have rushed to the spot pushing the rescue operation. No loss of life has been reported so far. Teams of State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) have reached the spot from Jaipur. Hemant Gera, Secretary of Disaster Management, is keeping a close watch on the situation. Meanwhile, Jhunjhunu Collector Dinesh Kumar Yadav told DNA that there has been no loss of life and no major damage to property so far. Rescue operations are on. The administration declared a red alert in the district and have closed down some routes as a precautionary measure.

“It’s a matter of investigation. The flood water has entered a few houses, government buildings, buildings of police station, tehsil, power station and treasury inflicting damages to walls. But government records are safe. We have diverted the flow of water to open areas by deploying JCBs and putting sandbags in the stream of flow. We will not spare the guilty,” said Yadav.

How it happened

The water in the dam breached the walls and inundated the surrounding areas. It created panic and people ran for cover as the flowing water created a flood-like situation and washed uprooted trees and electricity poles on its way down.

Several low-lying areas were flooded as water from the collapsed dam rushed into the residential areas in Malsisar.

""The newly-built dam with the total capacity of 47000 million litres of water was filled with around 44000 million litres when gushes of water breached through newly constructed but ‘weak’ wall of the dam. The water then flooded the surrounding areas damaging the pump house and machines of Dechlorination House. The dam is being maintained by Nagarjuna Constructions. It has not been handed over to the government.

Project Factfile:

Launch of the project: August 2013

Total budget: Rs 588 crore

Beneficiary areas: Jhunjhunu, Sikar and 1473 surrounding villages

Work completion date: December 2018 (as announced in Assembly)

Area of the reservoir: 1.5 lakh sq metre

Capacity: 47000 million litres

Politics over dam

Chief minister Vasundhara Raje, on her recent visit to Jhunjhunu, had claimed that the state government completed the Kumbharam Arya Lift canal in a record four-year time which the Congress government could not do in 40 years. Former MLA from Congress Rita Choudhary blamed BJP government for this mishap. She said that the government, just to inaugurate this project before elections to bag poll benefits, expedited the work without taking care of the quality.

“BJP has rushed the work just to cut the ribbon. It’s the negligence of the government which has cost us this damage,” said Choudhary.

On the other hand, Member of Parliament from Jhunjhunu Santosh Ahlawat said that Congress should not play politics with disaster.

“It’s a major setback for us. It has damaged the project which is meant to cater to the water requirements of people of this area. Congress should not view it with a political angle,” she said.

Outcome:

The project will miss its date crashing dreams of lakhs of people pinning their hopes on this dam for water supply in this desert area. Three months ago, the government has started supplying water to few areas on a pilot basis in some part of Jhunjhunu and Malsisar.

Committee of 3 chief engineers formed to inquire about the cases of this incident. Who so ever is found negligent, action will be taken against that official, said PHED minister Surendra Goyal and added that people won't face any trouble related to water Rajat Mishra, principal secretary PHED and groundwater department has reached the spot.","Sun, 01 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2018/04/01/667209-malsisir.jpg,"['congress', 'water', 'jhunjhunu', 'million', 'rushed', 'areas', 'malsisar', 'project', 'surrounding', 'dam', 'spot', 'damned']",

Koko’s wife, daughters meet Khaleda

Several BNP men arrested

Nearly two months after she was sent to Old Dhaka Central Jail, BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia came out of it for the first time on Saturday and underwent some medical tests at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) for her reported illness. A black Pajero jeep carrying Khaleda reached the BSMMU around 11:30am amid heightened security, reports UNB. Upon her arrival at the hospital, the 73-year old former prime minister was offered a wheelchair to go to the Cabin Block on the 4th floor of the hospital. But she declined and walked to the lift and went to room No 512 for her check-up. After the doctors concerned examined her health, she was taken to the radiology and imaging department on the ground floor of a building opposite the Cabin Block, where x-rays on her knees and hands were conducted. The BNP chief went there on foot as well. The jeep carrying Khaleda, escorted by a huge number of law enforcers, left the BSMMU at 1:33pm and reached the jail around 1:46pm.After the BNP chief’s departure, BSMMU Director Brig Gen Abdullah-Al-Harun said Khaleda seemed to be in good health but her condition would be better assessed upon receipt of her medical reports. “Khaleda Zia’s physical condition is apparently good, but a better assessment of her health can be done after her x-ray report is released,” he told a press briefing at the BSMMU. Harun said: “We arranged a wheelchair for her but she preferred walking from the Cabin Block to the radiology and imaging department. Four doctors – Wahidur Rahman, Md Mamun, FM Siddique and one of her personal physicians in jail – accompanied her during the whole process. He said the test reports would be released today and then they would send them to the jail authorities. On April 1, a medical broad involving four professors of Dhaka Medical College Hospital was formed to examine Khaleda’s health condition and ensure her treatment as she suddenly fell sick in the jail on Nazimuddin Road on March 29. The former prime minister has been in the jail since February 8, after a trial court sentenced and convicted her to five years’ rigorous imprisonment in the Zia Orphanage Trust graft case.Sharmila Rahman Shithi, wife of the BNP chairperson’s late son Arafat Rahman Koko, and her two daughters Zafiya Rahman and Zahiya Rahman met with Khaleda at the BSMMU after completion of her medical tests. BNP Joint Secretary General Mahbub Uddin Khokan claimed he had arranged the brief meeting in consultation with the jail authorities. “Our chairperson had a very brief conversation with her daughter-in-law and two granddaughters.” Earlier, police barred Sharmila, her daughters and Jatiyatabadi Mahila Dal President Afroza Abbas from entering the Cabin Block as they tried to meet her there. Having failed to enter the building at that time, Sharmila and her daughters went back to their car and waited there for some time. Mahbub and Sanaullah Miah, two members of the BNP chief’s defence counsel, also met with her at the hospital.Law enforcers dispersed BNP leaders and activists as they started chanting anti-government slogans and tried to stage a demonstration in front of the hospital. At least five of the demonstrators were detained from the spot, claimed the party.","Sat, 07 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2018/04/DSC_7925.jpg,"['rahman', 'khaleda', 'cabin', 'bsmmu', 'undergoes', 'daughters', 'health', 'checkup', 'jail', 'medical', 'sent', 'hospital', 'bnp']",

(Photo by Thomas Ora)

Party leaders in Timor-Leste have agreed to maintain peace and national stability during an electoral campaign set to begin officially April 10 ahead of the election in May, which is already seeing signs of tension.

At the signing of a ""pact of national unity"" on April 7 at the Election Commission of Timor-Leste the eight parties and alliances competing in the poll also pledged ""not to insult other parties during the campaign.""

President Francisco Guterres 'Lu-Olo', in a speech, called on the country's elites to show maturity in politics and democracy and reminded them that leadership is not about power but serving the people.

He encouraged them to show the world that Timor-Leste, despite being a new democracy in Southeast Asia and the Asia Pacific, has something to offer the world through a fair election.

""The most important thing is to show people your programs, how to liberate people from poverty, not insult other parties,"" Lu-Olo said.

Timor-Leste's 1.2 million people are facing their second election in just 10 months after the minority government of Mari Alkatiri's Fretilin (Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor) Party, which narrowly scored the most votes, but not an outright majority on July 23, 2017, failed to secure enough support over eight months to pass any legislation including a budget.

But already Fretilin's competitor, a coalition led by the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CRNT) Party of former president and prime minister Xanana Gusmao, claims Fretilin is using its muscle in rural regions, where it is popular, to block their campaign.

In early March community leaders from six villages in Watulari sub district told local authorities they were rejecting efforts to conduct any flag raising in the villages.

On March 23, Taur Matan Ruak, another former president and head of the People's Liberation Party, a member of the coalition, tried to conduct a pre-campaign event in the sub district.

""Today some people told me that some Watulari people tried blocking my journey. I say to you nobody in East Timor even Fretilin will be able to stop me and Xanana Gusmao moving around,"" Taur Matan Ruak said at the time.

Mari Alkatiri, caretaker prime minister and secretary-general of Fretilin, on March 31 accused Gusmao and Taur Matan Ruak of trying bring down his government.

""Over the last seven months, the opposition's secret arm [Gusmao] was hiding abroad. Now he has returned he is trying to regain power — we should not allow him to,"" Alkatiri said to his followers during a pre-campaign rally in the capital Dili.

""I promise to you all my comrades, I will be deaf to their provocations.""

On April 6, in the mountain district of Lete Foho Ermera, a group of people ambushed and stoned the vehicle of Jacinto Rigoberto, a member of parliament and vice secretary-general of CNRT.

""They targeted me. They stoned my car,"" Jacinto Rigoberto told ucanews.com after lodging a complaint with the police.

The president said he also hoped that parties will speak about the maritime agreement between Timor-Leste and Australia signed on March 6 in New York.

""The maritime border is national affair, not of any single party,"" he said, and believed that Xanana Gusmao, who successfully led the negotiations, will not exploit this success during the campaign.

Gusmao has held several public meetings explaining the new deal with Australia. Still, the crucial issues of where the gas will be processed — in the northern Australian city of Darwin or on Timor-Leste's south coast, has not been settled and until then, no fresh revenue can flow.

Deputy Fretilin chairman, Francisco Miranda Branco, said his party would ensure all its members maintain peace and stability, adding the party was optimistic it would win the election on May 12.

""Our goal for the next five years is to build from the peripheries, to address the lack of clean water, agriculture, education, electricity, and roads,"" he said.

Fidelis Magalhaes, who represents the People's Liberation Party said the three-party opposition coalition will follow the unity pact during the campaign and when the election results are revealed.

""The pact is a symbol of a democratic state, to strengthen bonds among parties,"" he said.

In last year's election Fretilin won 23 seats in the national parliament, followed by the CNRT with 22, PLP eight seats, Democrats with seven and Khunto with five seats.

For the May 12 election, there will be two other coalitions competing, namely the Front of Democratic Development, consisting of four parties and the Coalition of National Movement, also with four parties.","Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ucanews.com/uploads/2018/04/1523351069.JPG,"['poll', 'party', 'timorleste', 'coalition', 'tension', 'rising', 'fretilin', 'election', 'president', 'kicks', 'gusmao', 'parties', 'xanana', 'campaign', 'amid', 'national']",
