• Delayed and below-average cumulative rainfall has delayed planting by at least three weeks in northern and parts of eastern Uganda. Near-average rainfall is forecasted in May and will likely support the development of late-maturing crops. However, the timing of the first season cereal and legume harvests will likely be delayed through early July, and aggregate production is expected to vary by subregion depending on the local amount and distribution of rainfall. Subnational production deficits are likely in northern and eastern Uganda, where rainfall may not be spread evenly in the crop cycle.

• Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes are expected through at least September in most bimodal areas, driven by carryover stocks from 2020, below-average staple food prices, seasonal agricultural labor income during the March to May planting season, and the anticipated average harvest in July. However, Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are likely among households in flood-affected areas and some urban areas, where livelihood activities were significantly disrupted in 2020 and income sources are still below pre-pandemic levels.

• In Karamoja, an increasing number of households face widening food consumption gaps and are utilizing negative livelihoods coping strategies, increasing the share of the population that is experiencing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. While food prices are generally stable and below average in most reference markets, the casual labor wage and the price of firewood, charcoal, and goats are declining, resulting in significantly below-average terms of trade and reduced household purchasing power. Below-average rainfall to date resulted in limited on-farm labor opportunities and delayed land preparation and planting, while others lack access to seeds.

• Planned and funded food assistance (cash and in-kind) equivalent to a 60 percent ration has sustained Crisis! (IPC Phase 3!) outcomes in April. Thereafter, an anticipated pipeline break in food assistance funding may result in further reductions in rations and food security outcomes. Refugees with arable plots are engaging in plowing and planting activities, though some lack access to inputs like seeds as others have yet to recover from the impacts of earlier COVID-19 movement restrictions on food and income sources. According to UNHCR/OPM, Uganda hosted 1,470,858 refugees and asylum seekers as of March 31st.","Mon, 03 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1565482-UGANDA_FSOU_04_2021_final.png?itok=ZR47nJcr,"['ipc', 'outlook', 'belowaverage', 'rainfall', 'food', 'phase', 'security', 'planting', 'delayed', 'outcomes', 'karamoja', 'update', 'uganda', 'likely', 'persist']",

By Stephen Otage More by this Author

The Ministry of Water and Environment has warned all people living on river banks and lakeshores to vacate before impending floods expected from the current rising water levels.

Dr Florence Grace Odongo, the director for water resources management at the Ministry of Water and Environment, said the water level on Lake Victoria, has risen to 13.4 meters, which is only short of 8cm to reach the levels of last year and yet the rain season has just started.

“Lake Victoria is getting full and the only way water exits it is through the River Nile, which drains into Lake Kyoga and Lake Albert that empty it but all these are also getting full of water. The only thing we are going to see is flooding of River Banks and Lake Shores,” she said.

Dr Odongo was on Monday presenting her ministry’s performance in the implementation of the 2016 NRM Manifesto in Kampala on Monday.

Dr Odongo explained that from last year’s experience where the water level on Lake Victoria hit 13.48 meters, the highest in 124 years, the situation is not looking good. This is because, she said, Lake Victoria basin traps water from Rwanda, Tanzania, DR Congo, Kenya, Tanzania and all the rain in Uganda yet the underground water system is full because of encroachment on wetlands and forests.

Mr Willis Bashasha, the director in-charge of the Manifesto Implementation Unit, noted that much as the ministry has performed well in increasing access to water and sanitation services across the country, it has done little to contain encroachment and destruction of forests and wetlands across the country.

Mr Sam Cheptoris, the minister of Water and Environment, admitted that much as they promised to increase wetland coverage from 10 per cent in 2016 to 12.4 per cent in 2021, it currently stands at 8.9 per cent due to increased population pressure. He attributed this to low enforcement of the existing laws.

“We have very few enforcement officers under the environment police. Under the 2019 Environment Act, we were supposed to recruit our own force like the Uganda Wildlife Authority but unfortunately, we do not have command over the Environmental Police to protect wetlands and forests,” Mr Cheptoris said.

The Environmental Protection Police Unit was created in December 2011 to support the Ministry of Water and Environment in enforcing environmental laws and regulations.

On Monday, the ministry was among the four ministries, which presented how they implemented the promises the ruling government made to Ugandans during the 2016 election campaigns. Other ministries are those of Science Innovations and Technology, Agriculture and Public Service.

Government has ordered all people living in flood-prone areas around Lake Victoria to relocate to safer areas as the country continues to receive heavy rain.

Mr Raphael Magyezi, the Minister for Local Government, asked district authorities to make arrangements and ensure that people swiftly vacate the affected landing sites on the lake shores.

“Heavy rains have already caused floods in some parts of the country and it is upon the victims with the help of district leaders to vacate flood prone areas for their safety,” Mr Magyezi said in an interview on Wednesday.

Last year, thousands of people were displaced after the rising water levels submerged a number of landing sites and islands around Lake Victoria and Lake Albert.

The victims were temporarily housed in makeshift shelters on the mainland as they waited for government to resettle them.

However, before government implemented the planned resettlement plan, many victims started returning to the islands and landing sites, claiming that the resettlement programme had delayed.

“The government’s plan to resettle the victims is underway although we have been constrained by lack of funds. However, people should not wait for floods to sweep them away. Let them relocate to safer places to save their lives,” Mr Magyezi said.

Masaka District alone has close to 20,000 flood victims, who were left homeless after water submerged Lambu, Kaziru, Kisuku, Malembo, and Kachanga landing sites last year.

Mr Aron Ahikiriza, a fisherman at Bukakkata Landing Site in Masaka District, said although the water levels are rising again, the lake remains their only source of livelihood.

“We can decide to sleep in rented houses far away from the landing site like we did the whole of last year but we cannot completely abandon the landing site because this where we earn a living,” he said.

Mr Rashid Babu, the manager of Mpongo Company Limited, which manages Lambu Landing Site, said government should expedite the process to permanently resettle the victims.

“Government should not be just talking, let them walk the talk because these people have been patient ever since they were promised to be resettled,” he said.

Mr Aloysius Jjuko, the chairperson of Bukakkata Sub-county, said the fishermen and their families are already scared of the rising water levels.

“We ask President Museveni to provide a permanent solution to the flood victims at landing sites. These people cannot resettle themselves unless they are helped by government,” he said.

Issue

Last year, rising water levels in various areas on Lake Victoria, Lake Kyoga, and Lake Albert shorelines wreaked havoc on many landing sites in the districts of Wakiso, Masaka, Mpigi, Kyotera, Kalangala, Mukono, Buikwe, Buvuma, Mayuge, Kayunga, Nakasongola, and Ntoroko displacing more than 40,000 people.

In Kasese District more than 100,000 people were displaced after major rivers in the area including Nyamwamba, Mubuku, Nyamughasana, and Lhubiriha burst their banks.

3,3,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Battling Rising Water in Uganda's Wetlands - Global Press Journal,https://globalpressjournal.com/africa/uganda/battling-rising-water-ugandas-wetlands/,"KIKUUBE, UGANDA — Standing on the shore of Lake Albert, on Uganda’s western border, Sanyu Sanday looks out past the surf to where her small mud house stands partially submerged in the water. She’s salvaged what she can — her mattress and other possessions sit on a small motorboat — but after living on the lakeshore for the past two years, she’s unsure about where she will go.

“The raging waters have cut us off from what we knew as home,” Sanyu says.

Severe flooding has stricken Uganda in recent years, as changing weather patterns have led to increased rainfall, causing lakes and rivers to swell. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced across the country, particularly in flood-prone areas surrounding Lake Victoria to the south, Lake Albert to the west, and Lake Kyoga in the center of the country. It’s a situation that is likely to become worse as global temperatures rise and people continue to destroy Uganda’s wetlands to build roads, houses and other infrastructure.

Since October 2019, rising temperatures in the Indian Ocean have led to intense and prolonged rainfall in Uganda, causing water levels in Lake Victoria, one of Africa’s Great Lakes, to reach historic highs not seen since the 1960s. This has caused extreme flooding in the Lake Victoria basin.

“Too much rain means too much collected in the basin, which overspills and floods neighboring places,” says George William Omony, a senior meteorologist at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority.

Edna Namara, GPJ Uganda Sanyu Sanday’s mattress and other possessions are loaded in a small motorboat on Lake Albert. Her house, in the background, lies partially submerged in the water.

The government has been working to relocate thousands impacted by the flooding. But people like Sanyu, who built homes in parts of the Lake Victoria basin without obtaining official authorization, haven’t been included in these resettlement plans, according to Jackson Twinomujuni, commissioner of International and Transboundary Water Affairs at the Ministry of Water and Environment.

Achidria Tony, a spokesperson for the National Environment Management Authority, says that while the government can’t stop climate change or the increased rainfall it brings, officials are trying to prepare for rising water levels.

“What we do is ensure natural flood control systems such as wetlands and forests are not degraded and are instead used sustainably,” he says.

Decades ago, Uganda’s wetlands were able to absorb such flooding. But infrastructure development has caused the country’s wetlands to dwindle — from 32,000 square kilometers (12,355 square miles) in 1964 down to 26,308 square kilometers (10,158 square miles) as of 2005, according to the Ministry of Water and Environment.

“In 1961, 1964, the water was contained without alarm, because there was enough forest cover and swamps,” says Twinomujuni, referring to the historic rainfall Uganda experienced in the 1960s. “There were no paved homes and drainage channels, which do not retain any rainwater, but leave it with the only alternative to flow into the lake, hence the rise.”

Edna Namara, GPJ Uganda Nankya Amina points to the flooded ground floor of her house, along the shores of Lake Victoria in Kampala. Uganda’s wetlands have been severely depleted, due to construction and development.

Rising water is a problem in Uganda’s capital city of Kampala as well. Annual damages from flooding, which were less than $10 million in 2013, could increase to between $33 million and $102 million by 2050, according to a report by Wilson Truman Okaka, a lecturer at Kyambogo University in Kampala, who researches climate change.

In 2014, Nankya Amina built a house with rental units in a wetland area within the city’s Makindye division, along the shores of Lake Victoria. She hoped to generate income to help support herself and her six children. By law, property owners must obtain authorization from the National Environment Management Authority before they can build. But Nankya didn’t submit her plans for approval.

“I knew environmentalists would not approve my plot, since it was in the wetland,” Nankya says. “Also, I did not want to spend my money on processing the plan.”

Now she regrets the decision. The ground floor of the house is submerged in water and continues to sink, forcing her to live in a small wooden structure nearby. Even this living situation may be temporary.

“Nankya and 385 households in Makindye West division have to relocate and give back the water its territory,” says Achidria. “We sent out early warnings telling them to move before the floods.”

Sanyu, for her part, has grown accustomed to being uprooted. She initially came to Uganda in 2018 after fleeing violence in her native Democratic Republic of Congo, just across Lake Albert. She has been living in Uganda without legal documents, making money by catching and selling fish, while taking periodic trips back to DRC to check on her aging mother.

She had hoped to remain in the area and find employment cooking for workers coming to labor in the nearby oil fields. With her home destroyed, that future is now in doubt.

“We are turned double refugees,” Sanyu says, “unable to sit in either the host or mother country.”","Sun, 21 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://globalpressjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GPJ-NEWS-UGANDA-EN-DOUBLE-REFUGEES-54_web2048-650x434c.jpg,"['square', 'lake', 'house', 'sanyu', 'wetlands', 'rising', 'uganda', 'water', 'flooding', 'ugandas', 'victoria', 'battling']", 
4,4,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Poor human activities aiding Butaleja floods - Daily Monitor,https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/poor-human-activities-aiding-butaleja-floods-3394406,"By Yahudu Kitunzi More by this Author

Environmental experts and local leaders in Butaleja District have blamed the re-occurrence of floods to massive environmental degradation and lack of a political will to mitigate the effects of such disasters.

The experts say swamps and river banks of Manafwa and Nakwasi have been mismanaged by the locals due to poor agricultural methods.

They also blame the floods on failure by the government to erect embankments on River Manafwa and River Nakwasi and restore flood early warning systems.

The system, which stopped functioning in 2016, had been installed by the government in 2015 to alert locals of the rising water levels.

The concern comes following the occurrence of floods that hit the district on Friday, killing one person, destroying property worth millions of shillings and displacing many residents.

The yet unidentified resident was swept by water as he attempted to cross Nakwasi River in Leresi Cell.

Houses were submerged and household items such as beddings, clothes and crops were washed away by the ravaging floods triggered by the downpour from Mt Elgon. Transport was also paralysed and schools rendered inaccessible.

The most affected areas were Butaleja Town Council and Busolwe Town Council.

When Daily Monitor visited the affected areas, the displaced people were wandering without food, shelter, clothing, among other necessities.

The district has been experiencing back-to-back floods since 1976, and environmentalists further predict that this is likely to continue.

“Environmental degradation is rife in Butaleja District and it has been worsened by the laissez-faire approach to the disaster by authorities,” Mr James Wire, an agribusiness consultant, said.

“As of now, there are no visible efforts at an institutional level to stop this problem and it is worrying,” he added.

Mr Wire said there is a need for the district to enact by-laws that will protect the environment.

“Simple approaches such as requiring a permit before a tree is cut down in public or private land may seem harsh but bear fruits in the long run,” he said, adding that residents should be given seedlings to plant trees on the river banks.

The chairperson of Masulula “B” Village in Himutu Sub-county, Mr Mesulamu Wabaye, said there is limited land and this has forced the populace to encroach on what should be the green spaces, especially the swamps.

Ms Lamula Were, the district senior environmental officer, said the situation has been worsened by locals erecting residential houses on the river banks while others are farming and quarrying near the rivers.

“People should stop digging up to the river banks. Butaleja District is on a low land area,” she said.

Ms Were said about 60 per cent of wetlands in the district have been encroached on. She, however, said the environmental law will not spare those who are encroaching on the wetlands.

She said the district environment office has started implementing a presidential directive to restore wetlands.

Encroachment

Mr Higenyi Kemba, a resident and an opinion leader, said the main cause of the floods is human encroachment.

“Human encroachment around the river banks causes heavy silting that fills up the river bed, hence reducing the size of the waterway. When this happens, the route that water should take becomes shallow,” Mr Kemba said.

Mr Kemba said people should plant bamboo trees on either side of the river banks all the way from Bugisu Sub-region to Butaleja and Bugwere.

“Bamboo trees will stop the silting. When this is done, the deposits already in the river can then be removed...,” he said.

Mr Moses Wegulo, a resident, said repeated floods have affected them, especially in terms of food security and road network.

For example since this year started, the district has been hit by floods four times leaving hundreds of people homeless.

“This road from Mbale-Butaleja-Busolwe, which is the main link between the two districts is always cut off by floods,” he said.

Ms Madina Hifudde, another resident of Butaleja, said the affected families need urgent financial and moral support.

“We appeal to the government and other non-governmental organisations to intervene because the situation is bad,” Ms Hifudde said.

The chairperson-elect for Butaleja District, Mr Michael Higenyi Bory, said about 15,000 families have been affected by floods.

He said the crops destroyed include rice, sweet potatoes and cassava.

“We request the government to intervene and help our people. We need shelter and food,” he said.

The district environmental officer, Mr Tom Wandera, said the district is making an assessment report to submit to the Office of the Prime Minister for assistance to the affected families.

“We ask our people who are in flood-prone areas to relocate to safer places as we wait for any assistance from the government,” Mr Wandera said.

He said they have gazetted Doho Rice Scheme offices and some schools for people who have been displaced.

The Resident District Commissioner, Mr Stanly Bayole, said the government has the political will and it’s aware of the damage caused by floods.

Pupils in the Rwenzori Sub-region, whose classroom blocks and school buildings were swept off by floods in Kasese and Bundibugyo districts, can now smile again after they got new classroom blocks, pit-latrines and other facilities.

The pupils had lost any hope of resuming classes after the reopening of schools by the government.

At Bikone Primary School in Kasese District in May last year, all the classroom blocks were washed away by floods after River Mubuku burst its banks, leaving more than 500 learners stranded with nowhere to study from.

The floods from River Thaku also swept away classrooms at Kisabu Primary School also in Kasese District, leaving more than 300 pupils helpless.

Others affected by floods include Budenge and Bughonga primary schools in Bundibugyo District.

In Ntoroko District, floods from rising water levels of Lake Albert submerged all the classrooms at Umoja, Rwangara and Kachwakumu primary schools.

The new classroom blocks and other facilities were built by Save the Children, a non-governmental organisation.

The head teacher of Bikone Primary School, Mr Shem Tabura, said during lockdown in May last year, all classrooms and school records were destroyed by floods as River Mubuku burst its banks.

“We are now happy because we had lost hope for the future of our pupils as all the classroom blocks were swept away by floods. We did not have any records as text books, PLE result slips from 1989 to 2019, among others were destroyed. We are happy to see that our pupils have resumed school,” he said.

Mr Josephat Muhindo, the head teacher of Kisabu Primary School, said three classroom blocks were swept away by floods.

He said the school currently has 380 learners and have been struggling to accommodate more students.

“Our community members and other stakeholders raised about Shs12 million, which we used to buy land elsewhere to relocate the school because we were advised that where the school was located is not good, but now we have got four new classrooms and pupils are studying comfortably,” Mr Muhindo said.

He said last year in July, officials from the Office of Prime Minister promised to build seven classrooms but up to now they have not received any communication.

Mr Colenelius Masereke, a parent in Ibanda-Kyanya town council, said when floods swept away the school they lost hope about the future of their children to go back to school.

“Some people in the community died in floods and good enough it was lockdown. We did not lose any students. We are happy to see that we got new classrooms for our pupils. We shall wait for the government to make additional infrastructure,” he said.

Mr Muhindo Bagonza Libbum, the project manager of Enabling teacher approach at Save the Children, said with Shs291.4 million, they built four classrooms each at Kisabu and Bikone in Kasese District while in Bundibugyo District, they built latrines at Budenge and Bughonga primary schools.

He said they have also given the affected schools Wash facilities and SOPs, motorcycles, digital cameras, among others.

Floods

Kasese and Bundibugyo districts are prone to floods. In May 2020, rivers Mubuku and Nyamwaba burst their banks, causing floods which displaced many people and destroyed several property.

In Ntoroko District, floods displaced more than 10,000 people in Kanara Sub-county and up to now those displaced remain stranded.

Frightened voices told her, her seven children and their neighbors to run. Heavy rains had soaked western Uganda’s mountainous Kasese region the day before, and now the area’s rivers had burst their banks. Torrents of water rushed into the valley, destroying homes, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure.

Bambu, 37, tried to escape. “I was stuck. The water was to my knees, and my hands held two of my youngest children,” she says. “We held onto whatever we could until help came in the morning.”

Bambu’s house was swept away in the flooding, but she and her children survived. Her husband was not so lucky. “My husband, who was at a bar when it happened, tried to get to us but was injured by a moving log,” she says. “As we could not get medical help in time, he died.”

The Kilembe Mines Hospital, the region’s primary medical center, which serves more than 20,000 residents, would normally have been accessible by an easy 15-minute walk. But the flooding destroyed the hospital and made area roads impassable, cutting off the region from other health care facilities.

Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda Water, rocks and mud swept through the Kilembe Mines Hospital and destroyed the medical center. Staff members were able to evacuate patients, and the hospital has reopened on a provisional basis at a new location.

The flooding affected more than 100,000 people in the region. At least 1,200 were left homeless and 18 were killed, says Godfrey Kabbyanga, mayor of the Kasese Municipal Council.

The dire situation is a consequence of environmental changes, as well as growing political and socioeconomic concerns. As a result, disasters like this are likely to become more common in the years ahead.

“In Kasese, rivers have been known to flood periodically since the 1940s,” says Evelyn Mugume, environment officer for the Kasese municipality. Climate change is causing snow in the mountains to melt, she says, increasing the frequency and severity of the flooding. Local residents also have been illegally building homes and farms along the banks of River Nyamwamba, one of the main rivers in the region, making the land too unstable to control the floodwaters.

“Areas along the riverbanks are supposed to be managed by government, but people have got to own plots there,” Mugume says. “They have degraded this land, because not all of them know how to manage it. Politicians use lip service to protect illegal occupants. They do not advocate enough for environment protection.”

The government has put forward plans to restore the riverbanks by constructing barriers to protect infrastructure and calling on residents to plant bamboo and reeds, which can help control erosion.

Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda Flooding from River Nyamwamba cut off one of the main roads in the Kasese area, affecting thousands of residents. Local officials are still assessing damage in the region and deciding how to proceed with reconstruction.

But Centenary Robert Franco, a member of Parliament who represents the Kasese municipality, says the responsibility for managing the land lies elsewhere.

“It’s not my duty to protect the environment – there are organizations for that,” he says. “We do not make these people stay on the land.”

Local residents say they are aware of efforts to restore the riverbanks, but the plans don’t put food on their tables, leaving them with no choice but to continue to build and farm along the river. “I cannot grow bamboo on the small land I have,” says Bera Edith, 36, a mother of five whose house was destroyed in mudslides last May.

Since the flooding, Bera, Bambu and approximately 900 other residents of the region have been living in tents and semipermanent houses in the Kibota Seventh Day Adventist Camp for internally displaced people.

Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda The Kibota Seventh Day Adventist Camp houses approximately 900 people from the Kasese region. Conditions in the camp have been deteriorating, and residents have appealed to the government to provide better accommodations and sanitation.

Conditions in the camp are deteriorating, according to Sikabyahoro Jimmy, the camp’s chairman.

“Many have symptoms of typhoid and malaria, and there are no drugs in the nearest health center,” he says. He adds that aid workers at the camp have been overwhelmed and that the last delivery of supplies was in October.

“There is no food, the hospital is far,” he says. “We have called for help, but no one is coming.”

Centenary says the government is aware of conditions in the camp and is trying to get the displaced residents food and other necessities, and permanently resettle them in areas less prone to flooding. But finding available land to house them has proven challenging, and many Kasese residents say they would like to return to their original homes, despite the risk of flooding.

Kabbyanga, Kasese’s mayor, says local officials are still working to assess the damage to the area. For Bambu and other Kasese residents, however, rebuilding has become a way of life.

“The mountains do get angry, but sometimes you get a rainbow after the storm,” she says. “I just hope to never experience the rage of the rivers again. I pray that for my children as well.”","Tue, 26 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://globalpressjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GPJNews_Uganda_PL_Hospitalbridge_-34_web2048-650x434c.jpg,"['devastation', 'camp', 'rivers', 'coming', 'land', 'help', 'region', 'residents', 'kasese', 'floods', 'uganda', 'flooding', 'hospital', 'face']",

But the River Unyama still poured in from the east and swallowed him, says Raymond’s mother, Sylvia Gimono, her eyes wet with tears. Raymond was two weeks shy of celebrating his third birthday when he tumbled off the bed into water pooling on the floor. His mother, in a nearby room, didn’t hear a sound.

An hour after his sister found him, Raymond was pronounced dead.

Gimono, who runs a small motel in this burgeoning community on the border of Uganda and South Sudan, blames the flood for taking her child’s life and decimating her business. She moved to the northern town of Elegu to make a living off increased trade as both countries, after years of internal conflict, settled into periods of peace. But she encountered a new kind of threat.

The November flood, which left thousands homeless and ruined numerous operations like Gimono’s, wasn’t the first. Destructive floods have overwhelmed the area multiple times in recent years as increasingly heavy rains meet with the side effects of a swelling population, including uprooted trees along the river’s banks and the destruction of wetlands through farming. While some officials point to the ramifications of growth, residents accuse the government of failing to implement a long-promised flood mitigation plan that may have spared businesses and saved the lives of children like Raymond.

Nakisanze Segawa, GPJ Uganda Ugandans who live near the border with South Sudan chopped trees along the riverbank to make room for an increasing population. This has made it more difficult to prevent flooding.

Government officials “are not feeling the pitch of the suffering of the people,” says Michael Lakony, a chairperson of the district where Elegu is located, about 163 kilometers (101 miles) from the nearest big city, Gulu. “This is a known disaster and should be easy to deal with.”

The town sits in a low-lying area especially susceptible to floods. “When it rains in Gulu,” he says, “in Elegu we cry.”

Uganda is experiencing more frequent and fierce droughts and floods, according to a 2018 climate change profile by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Rainfall is expected to increase, particularly here in the country’s north, escalating the risk of natural disasters.

Floods killed seven people last year, displaced more than 4,000 community members, and ruined billions of Ugandan shillings’ worth of goods, including cement and maize, Lakony says. Gulu received more than 90 centimeters (35 inches) of rainfall from September to November, about double the usual average, according to data from the national weather agency.

Nakisanze Segawa, GPJ Uganda Elegu sits in a low-lying area susceptible to flooding. Residents say the government hasn’t done enough to address the increased risk.

The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives could have solved the flooding problem in 2018, Lakony says, when it signed a memorandum of understanding with TradeMark East Africa, a Nairobi-based nonprofit focused on trade, to implement a flood mitigation plan worth 1.8 billion shillings (about $490,000). The plan called for constructing a drainage system to contain the floods and creating channels 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from Elegu to divert the water.

The area, by that point, had grown from a scattering of grass-thatched homes to a substantial community with a tarmacked road, the groan of breaking trucks and the constant buzz of moving commerce.

The growth started in 2008, soon after the end of Uganda’s two-decade civil war, which displaced nearly 2 million residents and, according to some estimates, killed more than 100,000 people. Three years later, South Sudan gained independence from Sudan and officially became a country. And the village of Elegu became a town.

Elegu’s population has grown about 30 times since 2012, when it had 4,000 residents, Lakony says. But nothing has come of the flood plan.

Government officials disagree. Amelia Kyambadde, the minister for Trade, Industry and Cooperatives, says an initial evaluation showed the area was too swampy to implement the mitigation plan. Government engineers are aware of the situation, she says, and are working with TradeMark East Africa on an alternative solution. She declined to discuss the timeframe.

TradeMark East Africa didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Nakisanze Segawa, GPJ Uganda Elegu’s main road lacks a drainage system that would help ward against devastating floods.

Wilfred Baguma, a local councilman, says water overflow has been an issue since the 1970s. But increased rain and farming near the snaking Unyama riverbank have worsened the problem.

Low-lying areas like Elegu tend to flood because residents have chopped down the trees near and along the river that could have contained overflow, says Joshua Zaake, executive director of Environmental Alert, a nongovernmental organization based in Kampala.

Many who have benefitted from growth are now the ones suffering. Sarah Nakizza, a household goods trader at Elegu market, has lost products to the floods. When the water flows through the market at night, she says, most of her stored goods get swept away.

Ugandans in the region initially made money exporting food, water, soap, eggs and construction materials to the newly independent South Sudan. But Elegu quickly grew into a way station for people who desired goods from either side — cooking oil, sugar and tinned milk are cheaper in South Sudan, for example — and for traders in need of accommodation.

Trucks lining the main road have Kenyan, Tanzanian and Ugandan license plates. Vendors sell sliced pineapples along a street crammed with lodges and a boisterous market.

Some now fear the repercussions of that development. Residents like Gimono demand a clearer strategy to deal with the lack of drainage channels and other mitigation techniques. If for nothing else, she says, than for her son.

Otherwise, “next time it will be another woman’s child killed by floods.”

For most of that time, Uganda’s government has been trying to chase him away.

Now, it is the water itself that has driven him from his small house on the edge of Entebbe, a Ugandan town that juts into Africa’s largest lake.

Thousands have been displaced from their homes along the shoreline by the worst flooding since records began more than a century ago. Musasizi, who works as a truck driver, is renting a room on higher ground until the waters recede.

“Homes have been destroyed,” said Musasizi, whose family came here originally seeking cheap land. “My friends are now on the streets.”

The Ugandan government has said people like Musasizi are partly to blame for the floods, and wants them to leave the wetlands for good.

It plans to start evicting people without compensation this month - in the middle of a coronavirus lockdown that has hit the poor hardest.

‘RICH WILL REMAIN’

Alfred Okot Okidi, the top civil servant at the ministry of water and environment, said 700,000 Ugandans had been affected by flooding nationwide, almost all of whom live illegally in the protected zones around lakes and rivers.

Settlement, cultivation and industry were destroying the wetlands, which act as “natural sponges” to absorb excess rainfall, Okidi told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The evictions are in line with a directive issued by President Yoweri Museveni, who warned in an address last week that the floods “should be an eternal lesson to all of us”.

That is a message heard with scepticism in the swamps of Entebbe, where houses crumble into the water and men fish in flooded gardens.

Peter Kisakye Zzimula, the pastor of a church on the wetlands, argued that people only build there because they cannot afford to rent property elsewhere.

“Nobody would wish to be here but people are oppressed,” he said. “If you evict them, where will they go?”

The rains over east Africa have been unusually heavy since last year and climate scientists have predicted more such weather in future.

But the flooding is exacerbated by local factors including the destruction of forests and wetlands, said Frank Muramuzi, executive director of the National Association of Professional Environmentalists, a civil society group.

Muramuzi said wealthy investors were snapping up land to grow rice or flowers for sale, and set up hotels and resorts.

“All those establishments are being done by rich people and some them have connections in government,” he said.

“The poor people will be evicted, but the rich people will remain.”

‘GOD HAS COME’

Last year, wetlands covered just 8.4% of Uganda, down from 15.5% in 1994, according to the environment ministry.

In 2014 the government ordered the cancellation of all land titles there, issued illegally by local officials because the law prohibits private ownership of wetlands.

A subsequent survey of four central districts identified 1,700 titles in wetlands, said Collins Oloya, the acting director of environmental affairs at the environment ministry.

But the process has become bogged down in lengthy court proceedings and only 300 titles have so far been cancelled.

Now the rising waters are forcing people out of the wetlands, doing Oloya’s work for him.

“I’m very happy that God has come,” he said.

But the political pressures that have stymied past threats of eviction may do so again, with elections scheduled for next year.

Police fired teargas at protesting vendors last month as they shut down a flooded market on another stretch of shoreline.

“We need to conserve the environment, but at the same time we need to be conscious that we are dealing with human beings,” said Kayanja Vincent de Paul, the mayor of Entebbe.

“It is a hotcake. If you handle it badly, it can burn you up.”

SUSPICION

Tensions are heightened by popular suspicion. Musasizi, the truck driver, believes governments have engineered the floods to grab land from the poor.

“After this water has chased these poor people, more hotels are going to be built here,” he said.

Meanwhile Judith Amojong, another resident, is hoping for divine intervention.

She used to sleep in the local church with a few other homeless worshippers.

One day she foresaw a great flood. “I got a dream where the world was full of water,” she recalled.

Soon after, the waters started seeping under the corrugated iron walls, bringing coldness and snakes.

Amojong, who is now sheltering at the house of a fellow churchgoer, hopes that she will not have to return.

Heavy rainfalls experienced in the Eastern parts of Uganda in the months of May and June 2019 caused flooding and landside disasters within the Elgon region, directly affecting 569 households (2,845 individuals) in four districts of Bududa, Sironko, Mbale and Butaleja. The landslides in Bududa district caused six (6) deaths, and injuries to 27 persons who were all treated and recovered. Pease refer to the EPoA for details on impact per affected district.

As anticipated, an outbreak of cholera was later confirmed by the Ministry of Health in Bududa district two weeks after the launch of this DREF operation, which affected the same community affected by the landslides. A total of 72 cholera cases, with 3 deaths were recorded (Case Fatality Rate=4.17%). The operation therefore refocussed its strategy towards provision of safe water, improved sanitation, and hygiene behaviours among the affected and other at-risk communities in Bududa, Sironko, Butaleja and Mbale districts. The Ministry of Health later launched Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaign in Bududa where the operation supported with community mobilization that increased uptake of the vaccine among all at-risk individuals. All these efforts led to rapid interruption of the cholera outbreak spread in Bududa that prevented it from affecting other at-risk areas in neighbouring Manafwa, Namisindwa, Butaleja, Sironko, Mbale and Bulambuli districts.

On 20 June 2019, IFRC launched a DREF operation worth CHF 151,041 to support Uganda Red Cross Society respond to humanitarian needs of 2,845 people affected by landslides and floods disasters in Bududa, Mbale, Butaleja, and Sironko district. The emergency operation successfully ran from June to September 2019, although the heavy rainfall situation was still widespread, which caused fresh flooding events in completely new areas around November 2019, just two months after closure of this operation.","Wed, 24 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1557103-MDRUG042dfr.png?itok=UygFxY8C,"['cholera', 'mdrug042', 'landslides', 'final', 'mbale', 'butaleja', 'sironko', 'operation', 'report', 'dref', 'district', '2019', 'affected', 'floods', 'uganda', 'n', 'bududa']",

The Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA) has warned that some parts of the country are likely to experience strong winds and hailstorms as the rainy season sets in.

The authority has asked Ugandans to take precaution because there will be cases of thunderstorm, lightning and hailstorms.

The alert issued by the authority in a tweet on Monday said: “Alert! The rains expected in most parts of the country are likely to be associated with medium to strong winds. Be sure to reinforce your roofs for living houses, granary stores, and others; if there is need. Keep safe.”

Dr Festus Luboyera, the UNMA executive director, said there is a high likelihood of having rains above normal levels in several parts of the country.

“The onset of seasonal rains is anticipated to be characterised by severe isolated lightning, thunder and hailstorms,” he warned.

He said the predicted rains forecast should be used for planning in all rain-fed economic activities so as to improve economic welfare and livelihoods for all communities in their localities.

“UNMA will continue to monitor the evolution of relevant weather systems, particularly the state of the Seas Surface Temperature and Indian Ocean Dipole, and issue appropriate rainfall alerts, updates and advisories to the users regularly, especially to those areas that have been heavily affected by floods and landslides disasters,” he added.

Dr Luboyera said the major physical conditions that are likely to influence the increased rainfall for the next three months in Uganda include the current and evolving Sea Surface Temperature anomalies over global oceans.

He specifically pointed out the increased probability for Neutral El Nino Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole through the months of March, April and May period.

Dr Luboyera said the expected rains in most parts of the country may, however, present good prospects for improved agricultural production.

“Farmers and other agricultural practitioners are highly encouraged to take advantage of the expected good rains to optimise food and crop production,” he said.

He also advised farmers to plant trees, restock livestock farms, fish ponds and apiaries.

Dr Luboyera warned that there will be floods in central Uganda and landslides in mountainous areas of Kigezi, Rwenzori and the Elgon regions. He also warned that there could be an invasion of locusts.

“The disaster risk management institutions should review their contingency plans,” he said.

He said areas expected to receive average to above average rainfall should undertake integrated flood management, flood preparedness and mitigation strategies in flood-prone areas and plans for optimisation of power generation and distribution should be enhanced due to the expected increased discharge of seasonal rain water into the water bodies.

He said the urban areas should prepare for the flash floods by clearing water and drainage channels.

“Urban authorities need to clear and reduce blockages of the drainage systems to avoid water logging on streets. Strong winds may be experienced, which can cause structural damages to buildings,” he said.

Impact on health

Dr Festus Luboyera, the UNMA executive director, said there is high risk of malaria in wetter areas of Teso, Lake Victoria basin, Lake Kyoga basin, lowlands adjacent to Elgon region, and risk of cholera is expected in Buliisa, Busia, South western, Bulambuli, Karamoja sub-region and Namayingo District.

“There is, therefore, need to conduct community awareness about the potential outbreak of the diseases in context and surveillance,” he said.

Then came the alarms raised by those living in the hilltop areas, those who could run, racing down to warn people along the valley and lowlands to run. A torrent of water was on its way down the mountain. Four rivers in Kasese district – the Nyamwamba, Mubuku, Nyamughasana and Lhubiriha – had burst their banks.

“I realised a disaster was coming. It was a matter of life and death,” Masika, 34, tells the Guardian. “I ran back to the house to wake up my husband and children. I knocked and alerted our neighbours. The floods and stones are coming to kill us,” she says.

That night heavy rains in the area of western Uganda swept away homes, schools, submerged farms, cut off bridges and left several roads inaccessible, affecting 24,760 houses and an estimated 173,000 people, according to a disaster committee interim assessment report.

Dorothy Masika and her son cook at their makeshift home in Kilembe

“We couldn’t sleep on the hill. It was so cold. The children were crying. There was nothing I could do,” says Masika as she lights a fire to cook at a makeshift home in Kilembe, about 10km north-west of Kasese town.

“We came back in the afternoon after the water had receded and saw the great devastation of the floods. The water destroyed and swept away everything,” she says. “We have been left homeless and very desperate. Where do we start from? We need urgent assistance.”

A few kilometres down the road of this tourist region, Philly Donald Baluku, a travel guide, said the impact was a disaster. “I have been working as a tour guide on a contract basis. The tourism sector closed because of Covid-19 restrictions. The floods have rendered me homeless now,” says Baluku.

“What do I do? I have nine dependents. My brother has offered us a single room to stay. But we don’t have bedding and food. We are living in a very hopeless and desperate situation.

“All my property, banana plantations, vanilla and crops which I was supposed to harvest in September were swept away.”

The floodwater destroyed the Nyamwamba hydroelectric power station, and overran the wards, mortuary and drug stores of Kilembe Mines hospital.

The villages of Kyanjuki, Bulembia and Katiri are now buried under mud and huge stones that were propelled down the mountain. Homes on lower land are submerged in water.

“I haven’t seen anything like this. I’m seeing for the first time where everything has been run down,” says Stephen Oluka, the director of Uganda’s National Emergency Coordination and Operations Centre, on a visit to Kasese town.

“The infrastructure has been damaged. The hospital and power station has been overrun. People’s houses along the path have all been swept away. Gardens, crops and cows have been taken away,” he says.

Buildings damaged by the flooding at Kilembe

Schools and churches have been designated temporary displacement camps.

“The living conditions are bad and alarming. The basic facilities are lacking,” says Catherine Kugoza, 37, a mother of six, sheltering in Karusandara church, about 20km south of Kasese.

“We are starving. People are taking dirty water from the stream. The one latrine is full. People are defecating in the open. This is a recipe for disease outbreaks like cholera and dysentery.”

When the Guardian visited Karusandara on Saturday, the camp was hosting more than 1,000 people, mostly women and children, with just 18 tents supplied by Save the Children.

“It’s a crisis situation. We have children in the camps. They don’t have blankets, they need mosquito nets, people don’t have food,” says Robert Centenary, a lawmaker for Kasese municipality. “People don’t have supplies for purifying water; they don’t have utensils to use in the camps. The situation has caused an appalling sanitation crisis. We may end up degenerating into a cholera outbreak.

“We really need a lot of water and sanitation support. We want the government to immediately come to the rescue of the people.”

The Uganda Red Cross Society says the immediate needs include shelter, food, bedding, mosquito nets, utensils, mobile toilets, water storage facilities and tarpaulins. It is appealing for more resources.

Oluka says overcrowding in makeshift centres had complicated efforts to combat Covid-19. “The guidelines have been compromised. I didn’t see anyone [displaced] in the camps with a mask. The leaders are telling people to maintain social distancing but it’s not attainable. There is overcrowding in camps.”

He adds: “I don’t think they are now bothered about coronavirus, which they haven’t seen. They are bothered about what has affected them now [floodings], safety from waters and their livelihoods.”

In its outlook for March to May, Uganda’s National Meteorological Authority warned of heavy rainfall over several parts of the country, which could lead to flooding and landslides, causing loss of lives, destruction of property and infrastructure.

The most affected sub-counties include; Lotome, Ngoleriet, Kangole town council and Matany with many families affected as well. The floods covered the newly constructed road of Moroto, Soroti near Presidential state lodge in Moruling.

Betty Nangiro, one of the affected residents of Kangole town council told Uganda Radio Network (URN) that her houses are full of water and all her food has been soaked in water. “I don’t know where to start from, because right now I don’t have anything to give to the children for supper because all the food has been soaked in water,” said Nangiro.

Another resident Joseph Lokol told URN that floods have swept away eight of his birds and two pigs that he received from the Operation and Wealth Creation programme. “I don’t know where the floods have taken my eight birds and two pigs. I had a lot of hope to see the pigs change my situation in the long run,” he said.

Simon Kotol, the vice-chairman LC1 of Kangole chini told URN that many birds have been washed away by running water. He said the floods would worsen already starving families who have been facing a big challenge to afford food. “We have been receiving rains but this is too much and abnormal am sure many families are going to be affected,” he said.

Jimmy Tebanyang, the LCV councillor for Ngoleriet sub-county in Napak district appealed to development partners and the office of the prime minister to come and support the flood victims. He said although the people of Napak have been eager to have rain, the current rains are too much that they are washing away plantations.

By Justus Wanzala

BUDALANGI, Kenya, Aug 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Women dashed around open kitchens dotted across the playground of Bubango Primary School, preparing to feed the hundreds of children who now call the school in western Kenya their home.

About 400 families from Budalangi, in Busia County, have been living at the school since April, when the Nzoia River that flows from Kenya's western highlands into Lake Victoria burst its banks in the worst flooding the area has seen in decades.

After more than a year of unusually heavy rainfall, over 800,000 Kenyans have been displaced by flooding, according to the government.

The situation has been made worse by flooded rivers channelling huge volumes of water into Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake, causing it to spill over onto its shores - a phenomenon called ""backflow"".

""We lost everything when our homes got inundated with water. Houses have been destroyed, livestock and crops swept away,"" said Hesborne Opondo, 45, who lost his shop to the rising lake.

His wife now sells flatbread to others living at Bubango school to support their six children, he added.

Scientists warn that other massive flood events may be ahead as climate change strengthens, and some have urged the three countries that share the lake - Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania - to work together to put systems in place to lessen flood damage.

""There should be a joint effort in dealing with disaster management and preparedness in the lake region,"" said Alfred Owuor Opere, a climate and water expert at the University of Nairobi.

Management of the dams that regulate the flow of water into Lake Victoria should especially be a regional concern, as the area is expected to receive enhanced rainfall in future, he added.

While Budalangi is no stranger to flooding, in recent years the damage has been limited by two dykes the government built 20 years ago along the Nzoia River and on the southern shore of Lake Victoria, according to local elders.

But this year, the dykes could not contain the flooding - the most severe the area has seen since the 1960s, say experts, who attribute it to a combination of climate change and the erosion of shores by urbanisation and farming.

A year of extraordinarily heavy rains, which started in April 2019 following a drought, pushed the lake's water level up to 13.4 metres (44 feet) in May, breaking the previous 1964 record, according to the Lake Victoria Basin Commission.

In normal years, the lake has an average level of 12 metres.

While the waters that burst from the Nzoia have started to recede, the backflow from the lake is still flooding surrounding areas, residents said.

DAM DIPLOMACY

With climate change likely a major contributor to the recent flooding, the nations around Lake Victoria must work together to tackle the problem, said Joseph Awange, a professor of earth sciences at Curtin University in the Australian city of Perth.

""Engineering measures such as damming and planting trees to regulate the use of water could be considered,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email interview.

Uganda, where Lake Victoria feeds into the Nile River, is seen as a key player in preventing flooding in the region, he noted.

Since its construction in 1954, Uganda's Nalubaale dam has controlled the flow of water out of Lake Victoria into the Nile, in line with a treaty between Uganda and Egypt, he explained.

If the water in the dam rises above a certain level, Uganda must release some to maintain the natural flow of the Nile.

Leaders in western Kenya have accused Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni of not doing enough to control backflow.

In June, Raphael Wanjala, a member of parliament for Budalangi, called on the East African Legislative Assembly to intervene and urged Museveni to complete the ongoing construction of another dam along the Nile.

But Sam Cheptoris, Uganda's environment minister, told media in May that the rapid rise of Lake Victoria was due to a mix of environmental degradation, poor land use practices and urbanisation that has stopped the ground absorbing rainfall.

These factors resulted in the ""speedy movement of water into the lakes and rivers"" feeding into Lake Victoria, he said.

SILTED RIVERS

George William Omony, a senior meteorologist at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority, said that above-average rainfall plays a major role in causing backflow but the phenomenon has been amplified by human activities.

He pointed to the growing number of villages and farms on Lake Victoria's shores, which are protected areas where human settlement and farming is prohibited.

When forests along the rivers that feed into the lake are cleared for farming, they lose trees whose roots hold onto soil and minimise the amount of mud and silt that end up in rivers.

When rivers become silted, they can hold less water before overflowing or pushing it back into the lake, he explained.

He and other climate experts said the recent extreme flooding is linked to a cyclical process of drought and heavy rainfall that happens in the Lake Victoria area every 50 years or so.

""While it is difficult to tell when the cycle will repeat, the chances of it happening again are high,"" Omony added.

BENEFITING COMMUNITIES

Opere, at the University of Nairobi, said Lake Victoria communities and the government could also work together to reduce the risk of backflow and flooding.

He suggested planting trees along rivers and building channels to carry floodwater away from the lake and into water pans and reservoirs to use for livestock and irrigation.

He also stressed the importance of dams in regulating the amount of water flowing into Lake Victoria.

Plans by Kenya's government to build major dams to curb flooding along the Nyando, Nzoia and Yala rivers - the first of which is due to start construction on the Nyando in September - will help protect and support local communities, he added.

Government officials have said residents will be allowed to fish in the water behind the dams and use it for domestic and agricultural purposes.

""The dams will have a huge impact in reducing this flooding menace around the lake while providing economic opportunities for people living in these areas,"" Opere said.

Hundreds of people have been killed by floodwaters in Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Rwanda and Ethiopia which have also displaced hundreds of thousands across the region.

Heavy overnight rains flooded areas around Mountain Rwenzori in Western Uganda after the River Nyamwamba burst its banks, forcing people to seek refuge in nearby schools and destroying roads and bridges, a senior government official said.

“What complicates the matter is that this is the era of COVID. People are expected to maintain social distance but how do you maintain distance in such a situation?” Julius Mucunguzi, spokesman for the prime minister’s office, said by telephone.

One of the hospitals in the area, Kilembe, was also overrun by the gushing waters despite being built on a raised bank and reinforced with sandbags.

“There are wards which were completely washed away. The mortuary was swept away. You wouldn’t know that once upon a time there was a mortuary there. The drugs and drug stores were washed away,” Mucunguzi said.

In Ethiopia, the Somali region in the east of the country has borne the brunt of the floods, which have displaced more than 100,000 people, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

In neighbouring Somalia, an unspecified number of people were killed when floods washed away an entire small town in the semi-autonomous Puntland region, officials said.

The heavy rains stem from moisture dumped in the region by winds coming in from the Indian Ocean where temperatures have risen in recent months, Chris Shisanya, a professor of climatology at Nairobi-based Kenyatta University, said.

“This is a carry-over of what we had last year,” he said, referring to floods and landslides in the region.

Nearly 200 people in Kenya have been killed by the floods, which have also displaced 100,000 more.

“This is compounding the COVID-19 response,” Kenya Health Ministry Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman told a news conference.

“The displaced people have been forced to congregate in makeshift camps with the risk of banding together exposing them to the possibility of contracting the virus.”

“As members of from sugar growing areas, we would like to register our dismay at the casual nature in which the trade ministry has continued to handle an issue that has potential of destroying the livelihoods of eight million Kenyans who depend on the industry,” Koyoo said.

“While the Agriculture Committee investigating the circumstances under which 10 companies belonging to two individuals imported 47,000 metric tons without the prerequisite pre-shipment inspection from the Sugar Directorate, the same Trade ministry which has been mentioned as having overstepped mandate has gone ahead to sign a communiqué’, a clear affront to Parliament and its institutions.”

Okelo said they will not allow a grain of the imported sugar to enter into the country and flood the market linking the importation deal to the coming 2022 elections campaign funding.

“Towards elections, things like sugar importation and hike in fuel prices become common since sugar barons and cartels are trying to raise money for campaigns,” Okelo said.

Odege said Uganda has no advantage over Kenya in terms of sugar production faulting the government for doing little to revive the country’s sugar sector.

“This will open floodgates for other people to import sugar from other countries through Uganda and the net effect is that all our factories will die,” Naicca said.

At least 16 bodies have been recovered after torrential rain caused landslides in western Uganda, the Red Cross has said.

“Our team continues to recover more bodies including some that are trapped by cocoa trees in Bundibugyo hills. It is a very devastating moment,” the humanitarian agency said in a tweet on Sunday.

An aid team has been deployed to search and recover bodies in Bundibugyo district, which was affected by the landslides after days of heavy rainfall.

“We have provided body bags and blankets to manage the dead in a dignified manner before handing them over to families and hospitals,” Irene Nakasita, Red Cross spokeswoman, said.

The East African nation is undergoing its second rainy season, which has reached its peak in most parts of the country. The Uganda National Meteorological Authority has predicted heavy rainfall will continue throughout December.

The heavy rains have caused destructive flooding in several low-lying parts of the country and landslides in the mountainous regions. Destructive wind and hailstorms have ravaged plantations and crops across Uganda.

More than 20 people have been killed as a result of floods and mudslides in the last week in Uganda. The eastern parts of the country have also been suffering floods and landslides around the Mount Elgon region.

In a statement on Friday, Musa Ecweru, Uganda’s minister of state for disaster preparedness, said: “Four people were killed in Bududa district and another four including two children in Sironko district.”

“Over 10,000 people have been displaced in eastern Uganda alone and we are currently reviewing villages’ household registers to establish the number and names of missing persons,” Ecweru said.

The government has now released more than $5.4m for emergency procurement.

These include inflatable boats, tarpaulins, blankets, relief food, drugs for water-borne diseases and culverts for fixing washed away bridges.

The extreme weather has been blamed on the Indian Ocean Dipole – a climate system defined by the difference in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the ocean.

At the moment, the ocean around East Africa is far warmer than usual, resulting in higher evaporation and moist air flowing inwards over the continent as rain: the hallmarks of a “positive” dipole.

Description of the disaster

On 12 December 2019, Uganda Red Cross Society (URCS) with support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), launched a DREF operation in response to landslide events which occurred following prolonged rainfall from 29 November and 3 December 2019 the districts of Mbale and Bududa in Eastern Region of Uganda. These landslides affected 380 households (1,900 people). These landslides occurred in the broader context of extensive flooding across the whole of Uganda, which started in October and continued throughout December 2019.

During the assessments, URCS working with government (district and National teams such as the DDMCs) rescued and provided temporary shelters as well as psychosocial support to the affected and most vulnerable persons using resources at hand. Indeed, within the same period, Uganda had experienced another major flood and landslide in the Western region of Bundibugyo with 4,436HH 30,919 individuals (14,873Males and 16,046 Females) affected with 2,450 of those displaced and living in the two camps of Simuliki and Bubukwanga camps. As such, the NS extended the scope of the response to provide WASH assistance to the families affected in this district, which allowed URCS to reach 37,603 people (approx. 7,520 HH) through this DREF operation.","Mon, 01 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1557671-Uganda%20-%20Landslides%20Final%20Report%20-%20DREF%20Operation%20MDRUG043.png?itok=KKz80Nxs,"['mdrug043', 'landslides', 'urcs', 'red', 'final', 'operation', 'report', 'support', 'dref', 'response', 'region', 'occurred', 'affected', 'uganda']",

A week of heavy rains caused floods and mudslides in Eastern Uganda’s Bugisu and Bundibugyo regions near Rwenzori Mountain.



Authorities say the flooding has taken a toll with the loss of life and property, and with thousands more left stranded.



The Ugandan Red Cross’s Irene Nakasita says search and rescue operations in the regions are hampered as most roads have been washed away.



“And the decision has been taken to put up a transit shelter until the situation normalizes. So, most likely Bubukwang transit center is going to house close to 700 people who are displaced in Bundibugyo,” she said.



Meanwhile, Uganda’s State Minister for Disaster Preparedness and Relief Musa Ecweru says there are concerns about water-borne disease outbreaks in flood-affected areas.



“Now, there’s a risk of contamination of water and if that is not handled well, then we are going to risk another phase of a challenge, an outbreak of cholera which will compound our humanitarian intervention,” he said.



Ecweru says the government has released $5.4 million for emergency drugs to treat water-borne diseases, inflatable boats, tarps, blankets, food, and repairing bridges.



Ugandan authorities say the flooding is expected to recede in January as the weather improves.



Scientists have long warned that rising ocean temperatures are making seasonal rains more severe and more frequent.



The United Nation’s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) last week (Dec 4) said unusually heavy rainfall and flooding in East Africa has affected over 2.8 million people and left at least 280 dead.

UNOCHA said the unusually heavy rainfall was driven by the differences in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the Indian Ocean.

The UN office said rains were expected to diminish in the weeks ahead but heavy rains would likely persist into December and intensify in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

As the world battles a pandemic, large swaths of the African continent have been —literally — submerged by floods.

Since March, this crisis has left more than 400 people dead in East Africa. A separate round of flooding has hit West Africa’s Sahel region.

In Uganda, Catholic Relief services estimates that as many as 580,000 people are affected.

Country director Niek de Goeij says ""It's kind of affecting all kinds of people. You know, in Kampala, our capital city, it affects people who have nice houses on the lakeshore. But if you are in the Mount Elgon area, on the border with Kenya; or you're in the Kasese area, on the border with the D.R. Congo, and you’re a smallholder farmer normally benefits from farming on a river bank. And suddenly there’s this raging flash floods that comes down to hills and mountains because of this very intense rainfall — you know, you lose everything. You lose your house, you lose your land. And so it's a very diverse group of people that is affected.”

In the eastern town of Jinja, along the shores of Lake Victoria, radio host and environmental activist John Hillary says flooding doesn’t just destroy homes it ruins the very fabric that holds society together.

“The public hospital, the only public hospital in the Chilembwe region, was completely destroyed. So people as a result of the floods got sick. But they could not get anywhere else to go to because the hospital had been destroyed,” he said.

De Goeij says heavy rainfall is normal in East Africa — what isn’t, he says, is their frequency and intensity. And, he says, the pandemic makes it harder for groups like his to respond.

“It's like a triple crisis in Uganda, right? We have the locusts, we have all the floods. And then, on top of everything else, we have COVID-19. And so it's been, for the affected people, it’s been an especially hard year, you know, to be on a lockdown and be affected by floods, and then because of the lockdown, accessing the support and the relief that that they're entitled to,” he said.

Hillary, who speaks often about climate change on his radio show, says that to him and other activists, this is personal.

“My mom is a gardener. My grandparents, and many people in my family, are farmers. That's what I've known,"" he said. ""Growing up, I always went with my mom to the garden to dig, and we ate food from the gardens.

I'm only 26. I have seen over time my world deteriorating. I don't want to see the same for my children.”

This, he says, is a living nightmare.

Recognizing that many parts of Uganda including Lake Victoria received above normal rainfall between mid- April to late June, 2020, water levels have risen further resulting in floods with severe effects around the country.

At Ggaba landing site located North of Lake Victoria and Port Bell, a small industrial Centre in the South of the Lake, life and settlement has been disrupted by the flooding water that has submerged the areas.

Places such as Ggaba and Port Bell markets have all been submerged by water and traders have resorted to selling food and other items on the road that leads to the markets. Similarly, happening places such as Ggaba Beach, K.K Beach, Miami Beach have been swallowed by water. Others that have been affected are Ggaba Water Works offices, Serena- Kigo Hotel, Speke Resort Hotel- Munyonyo, and several others surrounding the great water body.

The question on most people’s minds when they see a flooded market, homes and businesses on the shores of Lake Victoria is whether the beaches, landing sites, and some islands they have known all their life will resurface.

Standing at the flooded part of Ggaba landing site is Kassim Katende, the chairperson of the fishermen at Ggaba.

“Most of the community members here depend on fishing, but right now we do not have fish because the lake is full of water and security forces are guarding the waters,” lamented Katende.

Sarah Kaine, a businesswoman who sells food items at Gaba, expresses her fears for the dying business because of the flooding of the area.

""Our customers have disappeared and we are worried that we may not be able to continue with our business again. My selling point has been flooded and I have no other option but to wait until it dries up,” narrates Kaine in agony.

Mzee Sulaiman Kassujja a trader dealing in fish selling at the same landing site for the past 25 years narrates that, “we who sell fish are affected so much because fishermen no longer catch good fish and in large quantities. The few fish caught are very expensive.”

According to Sulaiman, the rise in the price of the fish has made their customers to opt for other substitutes such as meat and chicken. He further noted that the rise is also as a result of the challenge in accessing the catch from the lake and increase in costs as a result of lockdown.

Currently, a big tilapia goes for UGX 35,000 ($9.21), up from UGX 20,000 ($5.26), an initial price before the disaster outbreak.

Hamis Gamwero, the LC1 for Ggaba landing site and has lived in Ggaba for four decades said, “Since I came here in 1986, I have never seen this kind of flood. The people, especially traders are at a high risk of contracting other diseases, and it is worse that we have coronavirus.”

Kamadha Kakooza, the Katoogo Village, chairperson, told us that at least 500 families have already left the place and hundreds, which have been rendered homeless, have been accommodated in other peoples’ homes that are yet to be invaded by the overflowing water.

“When the water levels started rising, those who could, chose to vacate the area. Some [who had nowhere to go] remained. What we did was to talk to those who are yet to be affected to at least accommodate those affected for some time,” he said.

Meanwhile, at Port Bell in Luzira, which is also a rail link and a railroad ferry wharf used for International traffic across Lake Victoria to Tanzania and Kenya, the story is not different. The water has entered into houses of the dwellers and forced them to seek refuge somewhere else.

“People are trying to desilt the water by pouring sand but the environment authorities are against it,” said Teopista Nankinga, a women’s leader at Port Bell.

Markets and settlements near the Lake have severely been affected and homes submerged by the flooding water. The disaster has also been recorded at the same time when the country is under lockdown in March because of COVID-19. This means that the affected people are left with a few options for survival since most of them could not travel to their villages.

Many of these businesses and government installations were located outside the 200 perimeter buffer zone recommended by the government. Their destruction raises tough questions about the level of government planning. If the 200 meter perimeter buffer zone recommended by the government is not safe, what is safe? Suppose businesses move farther away from the expanded lake shore, what happens when the lake shore eventually recedes?

The continued downpour and flooding has had negative impacts on the people and property downstream of Lake Victoria during the time when the country and region at large is on a lockdown, as a means of controlling the potential spread of coronavirus.

Environment experts warn that the flooding of the lake tributaries has been accelerated by environmental degradation, which has caused a disruption of the water bodies.

Dr. Daniel Babikwa, the District Support Coordinator at the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), said that the communities encroached on the shores of the Lake, thus disturbing nature.

“Unfortunately, many people encroached on the shoreline and what you see now are the results of the impact,” said Babikwa.

On the same note, Beatrice Anywar, the Uganda State Minister for Environment, told us that most of the structures including Beaches set up around the Lake were illegal.

The Minister revealed that the government is encouraging voluntary migration of the settlement away from the endangered zones of the lake shores, and warned that action will be taken against those who will not leave.

In the same call, Dr. Tom Okurut, the Executive Director for NEMA, advises the affected residents to vacate the natural habitats lest they will be forcefully evicted.

A statement issued by the Ministry of Water and Environment on 1st May, stated that the Lake Victoria water level continues to rise to critical levels despite increased releases due to the increasing inflows and heavy rains in Lake Victoria Basin. At the same time, the Rivers discharging into Lake Victoria from upstream countries have uncontrollably more than doubled their inflows.

The current water levels that started last October (2019), have consistently continued to rise up from 12:00 meters to the current 13:32 meters, the second highest increase recorded since 1964, when the water level rose to 13:46 meters.

What Caused the Rise of Water Level?

Sam Cheptoris, Uganda’s Minister for Water and Environment, explained that Lake Victoria has over 23 rivers flowing into it from the three East African Countries that include Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

According to the Minister, when it rains, an increase in the waters from those rivers results into the direct increase in the water they pour into the largest freshwater lake in the continent.

“Some of these rivers originate from as far as Rwanda and Burundi: therefore, when it rains in those countries, water finds its ways into Lake Victoria,” explained the Minister.

Mr Cheptoris further noted that, “a number of areas around lakes and rivers have been identified as high flood risk areas and essential features such as schools, health facilities and places of worship are at risk.”

Is the Government Taking Any Measures?

In a communication by Minister Cheptoris, the government has put into place a number of measures to help address the problems of the rising water levels and associated floods.

Government has since instituted measures to immediately get water out of Lave Victoria through increased releases at Jinja which is now at the rate of 2200 cubic meters per second, up from the rate of 1000 cubic meters per second in October 2019.

A national Response team comprising the Ministry of Works and Transport, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, Ministry of Defense and Veteran Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries and, Ministry of Water and Environment. The team has ready equipment and Machinery to carry out surveillance and monitoring of the movement of the floating islands and removed those that are considered a threat to the electricity power generation.

The Inter-Ministerial committee has also been set up, under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister, comprising 14 Ministries and seven Agencies to implement Government response to the disaster.

In line to that, a multi-sectoral Technical Task team chaired by the Ministry of Water and Environment provides support to the Inter-Ministerial Committee and has already started on emergency works on: ensuring safety of Hydropower dams, protection of lives and, monitoring and surveillance of water resources and floating islands.

At the time of compiling this report, the lockdown in the country was preventing people from using public means of transport, some businesses such as salons, bars and open access markets were restricted from operation- and potentially putting the survival of the affected people at stake.

Although the number of COVID-19 infections have reached more than 1000, Uganda has continued to register almost 100% recoveries by July, 2020.

Lake Victoria which is shared by three countries; Tanzania (49%), Uganda (45%), and Kenya (6%), hit 1,134.38 metres above mean sea level (mamsl) on May 07. That is a difference of about 1.32 meters and is significant because Lake Victoria is a very shallow lake, especially on the Ugandan side where it averages a depth of just 40 meters.

Lake Victoria lies on an average elevation of 3,720 feet (1,134 meters) above sea level. Kampala is just 1,200 meters above sea level, a difference of about 70 meters. Ggaba, which is 60 meters above at 1,140 meters above sea level, is already inundated.

If the current rate of rise in water levels were to continue, the State House in Entebbe, and Parliament of Uganda in Kampala itself could easily find itself submerged.

Episode 31

About six million people were affected by floods in 2020, from Rwanda to South Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania and beyond. Flooding can lead to disease outbreaks, such as cholera, and damage livelihoods, crops and the environment.

Why have floods become so bad in East Africa, and what can be done to prevent them?

Last Monday, Water and Environment was one of the ministries that presented their performance in the implementation of the 2016 NRM manifesto.

The ministry’s director for water resources management, Dr Florence Grace Odongo, revealed that the water levels on Lake Victoria have risen to 13.4 metres short of 8cm to reach last year’s levels and yet the rainy season has just started. People living on river banks and lake shores were, therefore, warned to vacate the areas before floods begin to rage.

Such warnings have become an annual repetition albeit in good faith as they are meant to avoid loss of lives and property.

Unfortunately, they are usually taken lightly by the audience for whom they are intended.

But then again, these people rightly referred to as encroachers would not even be there in the first place if environment laws were observed. Clearly, there seems to a problem when it comes to implementation of laws.

In a Daily Monitor story of May 14 titled, “Govt issues flood alerts, tells lakeside residents to vacate”, Mr Sam Cheptoris, the minister of Water and Environment, says one of the reasons they have not been able to contain encroachment and destruction of forests and wetlands is because of low enforcement of laws which is exacerbated by the fact that there are few enforcement officers under the environment protection police unit.

In a statement on the rising water levels of Lake Victoria and the Nile system last year in May, Mr Cheptoris directed that people living within the protection zones of wetlands, lakes, rivers, and forest reserves vacate with immediate effect.

He said the ministry was working with the Ministry of Local Government and other government agencies to evict people living within 100 metres of river banks, 30 metres of wetlands and 200 metres of lake shores, and in forest reserves.

He said the respective government offices, from the central to local levels, up to the sub-county and parish levels, has been informed about the directive and requested to take the required actions with immediate effect.

Was there an attempt to implement these directives in spite of the shortage of enforcement officers? What action is being taken against encroachers and how is government making sure that they do not settle in those areas again? How can the communities near the said areas be involved in stopping encroachment?

It would be prudent to present an audit of whether these directives were successfully implemented and if not, what can be done this time to get a better results.

This way, we can avoid repetitions of the same directives year after year with no lasting solutions.

HOIMA- As the country gears up for the reopening of schools for finalists, pupils of Primary Seven at Toonya Primary School in Buseruka sub-county, Hoima district, remain in uncertainty after their school was cut off by floods from Lake Albert.

The floods, which began in early April, have moved inland by over a kilometre from the shore, paralysing the activities of the fishing community on several landing sites.Henry Katalibabo, the Toonya A LCI chairperson, told New Vision that 222 houses, accommodating 1,068 people, have been affecteVd.

""The water levels keep rising. We are worried of the likely destruction of our homes,"" he said. Katalibabo said some pupils will be required to board canoes twice before accessing the area designated to accommodate them.

Moses Kyaligonza, the Toonya Primary School headteacher, said when schools were closed in March, they had 450 pupils with 38 in Primary Seven. Kyaligonza said it would be better to have these children accommodated in one place for their safety because trekking daily from their homes is risky.

Accommodation for teachers is also a big challenge because the flooded school had eight staff quarters. The houses that would have been rented by the teachers have also been affected by floods.

Dr Fredrick Byenume, the Hoima district health inspector, said waterborne diseases such as cholera and dysentery are likely to result from the floods.

""There is no doubt that the water is contaminated with faecal matter because all the pit latrines are filled up by water,"" Byenume said. He said they are planning to distribute chlorine tablets to purify the water as one way of preventing waterborne diseases.Byenume appealed to the public to desist from open defecation to avoid further contamination of the water.He said both the school and Toonya Health Centre III have been declared unfit for human use.

Joselyne Nyangoma, the Hoima district natural resources officer, said the flood waters have brought with them crocodiles and hippopotami, which are a danger to residents.

""You need to be careful with your movements in these flood waters because crocodiles have now left the main lake and settled outside,"" she said.

Dr Charles Kajura, the chairperson of Hoima district disaster management committee, said they had asked parents and school management committees to agree on the best modalities to safeguard the children returning to school.","Thu, 08 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['hoima', 'toonya', 'primary', 'flood', 'pupils', 'uganda', 'uncertainty', 'district', 'crocodiles', 'cut', 'floods', 'water', 'school', 'waters', 'schools']",

Try refreshing your browser, or MANDEL: Toronto doc in fentanyl trafficking scheme disappears Back to video Despite being sworn to do no harm, his greedy need to feed his extravagant lifestyle led this family doctor to endanger vulnerable addicts, and at the time of his arrest, he was even hoping to flood more of the drug onto the streets in return for more cash. So Otto, 62, more than deserved the stiff sentence handed down on Nov. 14, 2019. But he’s not behind bars — instead, he’s believed to be leading the good life somewhere in his native Uganda, far from the grasp of Canadian law. How did this happen? A week after his conviction, he filed notice to appeal his conviction and sentence, claiming his Charter rights had been violated during a police search and his sentence was “harsh and excessive.” The doctor was released on $100,000 bail — no deposit –put up by one of his brothers. He was ordered to remain in Richmond Hill, not work as a physician and turn himself into the Lindsay jail on the eve of his appeal, Nov. 27, 2020.

Article content He never showed. “Our records show that he absconded and was therefore in breach of his release order,” explained a manager with the Ontario Court of Appeal. “His appeal was therefore dismissed as abandoned.” Lawyer Michael McKee was working on Otto’s appeal when his client failed to show up for a meeting at his office or respond to his calls. He finally called his family and was told he’d disappeared on his way to visit another brother in Thunder Bay. “He may have crossed the border at Sault Ste. Marie and from there, all bets are off,” said McKee, who was left with an unpaid bill for legal services and transcripts. The last he heard, a family member had received a call from Otto that had an Ethiopian country code. Shockingly, the Ugandan-born Otto wasn’t required to surrender his passport when he was released on bail pending appeal.

The court found he’d been paid about $1,500 per script and prescribed 4,400 fentanyl patches between August 2015 and January 2016 — 3,800 of them dispensed from El-Azarak’s pharmacy. Patients would be paid $500 to fill the prescriptions and hand them over to opioid addicts and pharmacy delivery driver Liridon Imerovik, who would then sell them to other drug dealers, including Sean Holmes of Sudbury.

Article content It was Sudbury Police’s 2015 investigation of Holmes that led to the unravelling of the scheme and the arrests of Otto and El-Azarak. Ontario Superior Court Justice Joseph Di Luca found the doctor was shamefully motivated by greed. At the time, Otto was living with his family in a “small mansion” in Richmond Hill that had a substantial mortgage and had been recently refinanced. He owed “a significant debt” to the Canada Revenue Agency. And he had been suspended for two months and fined $10,000 fine the College of Physicians and Surgeons found he’d been cheating the system by falsifying Special Diet Allowance forms for patients. Suffering “financial pressures,” Otto turned to peddling a dangerous narcotic. While El-Azarak, the mastermind of the scheme, had been sentenced to 13 years, Di Luca said she couldn’t have done it without the assistance of doctors like Otto. And so he imposed the harsh 12-year sentence.

30,30,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Landslides Mar the “Pearl of Africa” - Eos,https://eos.org/articles/landslides-mar-the-pearl-of-africa,"Behind Uganda’s lavish beauty, climate change has taken its toll: Death, destroyed properties, and displaced communities increase as above-normal rainfall floods the country.

Uganda is known as the “Pearl of Africa” because of its stunning natural beauty and biodiversity. Its lush vegetation is associated with regular tropical rainfall, but the East African nation is now struggling to deal with more frequent and intense rains that are causing landslides.

Landslides can dump millions of tons of muddy debris in Uganda’s rivers and streams, said Mary Goretti Kitutu, Uganda’s minister of energy and mineral development and an expert on geology and landslides. Such debris can dam rivers, flood surrounding areas, and cause damage to infrastructure.

“The main landslide types [in Uganda] are debris slumps, which occur on concave slopes where water concentrates. Slopes facing northeast are most prone to landslides, which coincide with the dominant rainfall direction,” Kitutu said.

The region’s soil profile is significant, she continued, explaining that “topsoils have a high infiltration rate, which allows fast flow of water into the deeper, clay-rich horizons—promoting water stagnation and causing slope failure.”

Landslide Losses

Although Uganda has always experienced some loss of life due to landslides, the number of casualties has increased this century.

Over the past 25 years, catastrophic landslides have regularly hit the foothills of Mount Elgon, for instance, which straddles the border between eastern Uganda and Kenya. The region’s most devastating landslide swept the slopes in 2010. Although more than 300 people are thought to have perished, only about 100 bodies were recovered. Thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed.

In 2012, a landslide followed 2 days of heavy rains in the same area. At least 18 people were killed, and 15 houses were destroyed. In December 2019, five people died in mudslides following heavy rainfall, 150 houses were destroyed, and the crops of smallholder farmers were swept away.

The most obvious trigger for Uganda’s slump landslides is rainfall. Rainfall events of low intensity but long duration are thought to be the most disastrous, a pattern that is well known among Ugandan farmers.

Callist Tindimugaya, commissioner for water resources planning and regulation in Uganda’s Ministry of Water and Environment, attributed the increase in rainfall to changing climate patterns and rapid loss of forest cover due to trees being cut down to be used as fuel. Tindimugaya said climate change is likely to increase average temperatures in Uganda by up to 1.5°C in the next 20 years and by up to 4.3°C by the 2080s.

“Changes in rainfall patterns and total annual rainfall amounts are also expected,” he added, “but these are less certain than changes in temperature.”

“Rain Has Become My Enemy”

“Rain has become my enemy. When it rains, my heart sinks.” “Rain has become my enemy. When it rains, my heart sinks,” said Gerald Masaba, a coffee farmer in the Bududa District in eastern Uganda.

Masaba said many forests in the area have been turned into farms. The thin topsoil of converted forest often fails to retain water during heavy downpours, increasing the farm’s vulnerability to flood. In addition, terraced agriculture is not popular among farmers “because they believe terraces promote water infiltration, which triggers landslides,” Kitutu added.

Clovis Kabaseke, however, said farmers can be trained on how to successfully engage in terraced agriculture. Kabaseke is a lecturer and researcher in the School of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences at Mountains of the Moon University in Uganda.

Kabaseke said the agricultural method can be effective in maximizing arable land area in variable terrains and reducing soil erosion and water loss, but farmers need to be taught the most effective practices.

Displaced Communities

Alfred Okidi, the permanent secretary in Uganda’s Ministry of Water and Environment, said that in 2020, more than 850 people were permanently displaced by mudslides.

With assistance from partners such as the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Ugandan government was able to safely relocate these displaced people. Okidi said IOM and CERF provided $818,000 in emergency relief.

Musa Ecweru, the state minister for relief and disaster preparedness in the Ugandan cabinet, was hopeful that the relocation would ultimately help build communities and economies. “The landslide victims were settled in Kiryandongo District,” he said, “where each household was given land to farm so that they can move on with their new lives.”

Rosemary Nandudu, however, says the transition will not be easy. Nandudu was relocated from the wet, fertile ecosystem of eastern Uganda to the drier one of the western Kiryandongo District and said the land provided by the government is not fertile. “It has been hard for us to adjust to a dry land, when most crops we used to know and grow cannot grow there,” she said.

Margaret Kemigisa, who grows tea in the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains in western Uganda, said farmers who formerly grew crops such as beans, millet, and bananas have switched to tea. Tea requires heavy seasonal rainfall and is grown at altitudes that are less vulnerable to debris slumps.

“Farmers from Bushenyi, Kanungu, Mityana, Mbale, and Mukono—which are hilly—have been trained to grow tea, which can also be grown in greenhouses provided the soils are acidic,” Kemigisa said.

According to Nandudu, relocated communities also face lifestyle changes. They are unable to keep cattle in the new area and have to buy food, which was not the case in their former self-sufficient community.

Joseph Mafabi, who was relocated to Kiryandongo, had to find a new job in a refugee settlement to make ends meet. “I would have wanted to go back to the Elgon region, but the government is telling us that it is not safe to go back,” he said.

What Is Being Done

Community groups, government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations are working to reduce the frequency of landslides in Uganda, mostly by planting trees in vulnerable areas. In one settlement, a group of more than 100 teenagers began their own tree planting campaign to reduce the chance of future landslides.

Tom Obong Okello, executive director of Uganda’s National Forestry Authority (NFA), said the NFA has started planting trees on the slopes of Elgon to control soil erosion. “We are restoring the lost vegetation and trees to mitigate landslides in the area,” he said.

Trees for the Future, an international nonprofit organization, says it has planted more than 16 million trees in Uganda to help farmers restore their land and mitigate landslides.

David Duli, country director of World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Uganda, said WWF Uganda has helped organize community groups to reforest areas that have been the most affected by landslides. “Forests play a significant role in national development through their contribution to the ecological balance, energy, and industrial activities.…We have formed community groups to replant trees in areas that were affected by landslides, but we also wanted the community to own these initiatives,” Duli said.

Reports say the overflow of two rivers in western Uganda exacerbated the situation, causing buildings to submerge. A major hospital in western Kasese had partly been submerged according to the Red cross.

Betty Mbambu, flood victim spoke to the media: “I had just bought a plot. The flood came and washed away my property, cupboards, mattresses. Right now, we are here trying to see what things of ours we can dig out.

“We woke up and business and the property were destroyed. Right now we are trying to find the remaining properties (items) that could been buried in our house.”

The rains also led to damage of infrastructure, including roads, bridges and several farms were washed away.

In a related development in East Africa, floods have killed 65 people in Rwanda on Thursday and nearly 200 in Kenya last month.

Kasese floods death toll now 11 – Relief Web

The district and Uganda Red Cross authorities said the deceased included two students, and Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF) soldier, Lothorach Lokwang, attached to the Bwera-based Mountain Brigade.

At least 11 people have been confirmed dead following the new wave of floods that hit the Uganda-DR Congo border district Kasese on Thursday.

Nine of the deaths occurred in Kitholhu sub-county while the other two were killed in Mpondwe-Lhubiriha town council when floods washed them into River Lhubiriha, which burst its banks.

Also River Thako in the Town Council flooded.

The floods were as a result of River Lhubiriha, which borders Uganda and DR Congo along Kitholhu sub-county, in Bukonzo West Constituency. It burst its banks following the overnight torrential rains in Mt Rwenzori.

Cholera Oral Vaccination 2020

Ministry of Health will next month embark on Cholera vaccination in flood-prone areas following reports of anticipated heavy rains.



Oral Cholera Vaccine is used as part of the Ministry of Health’s Integrated Cholera prevention and control strategy. The others include the provision of safe water, improved sanitation, and high-quality case management.



Dr Joyce Moriku, the State Minister for Primary Health Care, says that the government has imported additional 1 Million vaccines which will be rolled out in May to complete vaccination of those that had earlier received the first dose last year 2020.



//Cue in: “In November 2020…



Cue out: districts as mentions.”//



According to Moriku, the flood-prone districts include Kasese, Busia, Namayingo, Obongi, Madi-Okolo, Ntoroko targeting to reach between 800,000 and one million people. These received the first dose and have been considered high-risk areas to flood reports during the rainy season.



During the floods, the districts face threats of an outbreak of cholera and other water-borne diseases. In Kasese district, River Nyamwamba bursts its banks displacing several people and washing away latrines. The residents also deposit human waste in polythene bags and dump it in the flowing water.



Dr Godfrey Bwire, the Assistant Commissioner of Public Health Emergency, urged the public to also follow preventive guidelines like regular hand washing, opening up drainage channels, drinking boiled water and clearing bushes around their homes.



//Cue in: “To open the…



Cue out: ...also sanitary facilities”//



In September 2018, the government launched a national cholera vaccination campaign that aimed to vaccinate over one million people in cholera prone areas.



Cholera is an infection caused by bacteria and affects the intestines. The main symptoms are watery diarrhoea and vomiting. This may result in dehydration and severe cases of greyish-bluish skin. Transmission occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the faeces of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms.

Gardens, roads, and homes in five sub-counties of Dokolo district have been submerged by the rising water levels of Lake Kwania, making over a thousand families homeless.

The people affected have moved to higher grounds as the devastating floods continue to wreak havoc in the district.

Olga Hope Eriong, a resident of Acungapenyi, Kachung parish in Agwata sub-county says the community whose homes have been submerged by floods is experiencing problems of lack of food and shelter.

She says there is a scarcity of building materials, so they are facing difficulties in constructing new houses.

Middy Amek, a mother of four, whose home was affected says the water level started rising last year and since then, it has covered more than 700 metres inland towards her home.

""I have to leave this place but it's not easy, due to lack of building materials,"" she said.

Karina Akite, a resident of the place says she last witnessed such flooding in 1962 but that time, there was much rain.

The ceremonial ground near her home is all flooded. Dokolo RDC Lawrence Egole said they recently used the ground during a funeral.

Kuranimo Dai, another resident said their homes are greatly affected.

Dai said at night, it's very cold, there're many mosquitoes and snakes. He also said the flood water smells bad.

Nelson Okello, a youthful retail trader in the village said he is being forced out of his home by the flood.

Ronny Opio Okodi, a resident in the area said over 490 houses have been affected by the water in the village. He is appealing for emergency assistance to enable them to relocate to high land.

Ongom Apita, 66, says floods have destroyed his citrus farm.

""Even my fish pond and bananas that NAADS gave me were destroyed,"" he said.

Agwata sub-county LC3 Chairperson Geofrey Ojungu says most of the people in nine villages, are affected by the water from the lake Kwania.

""We are planning to relocate them to schools and sub-county headquarter's land,"" he said.

The district chairperson Fredrick Odongo says the floods have affected the sub-counties of Agwata, Adok, Kwera, Adeknino, Okwongdul, and Kangai.

""Last week we went to the sub-counties of Kwera, Adeknino, and Okwongodul and found a number of homes destroyed, gardens flooded, and roads destroyed,"" Odongo said.

He said the road network in the district has been greatly affected and they have to be reconstructed when the flood subsides.

He said in Agwata, where they visited on Monday, they found a similar situation.

""A number of farms and homes have been destroyed,"" Odongo said.

He said they wrote to the office of the Prime Minister who sent a consignment of relief items including 15, 000kg of maize flour, 5000kg of beans, and 50 bundles of tarpaulin.

Odongo added that they have not received 300 pieces of blankets as indicated in a letter dated May 28, 2020, signed by Rose Nakabugo on behalf of the Permanent Secretary.

The Chief Administrative Officer of Dokoo district Isa Mbooge says although the consignment was not enough, he shared with his colleagues of Amolatar and Kwania.

""We have to appreciate what they have given us because everybody is looking at the same source,"" Mbooge said.

ENVIRONMENT

Musa Ecweru, the Minister of state for relief, disaster preparedness and refugees, has released a statement on the floods, landslides and windstorms disaster situation in the county. Here goes:

____________________________

The second rain season has reached its peak in most parts of the country and heavy rainfall will continue upto end of December 2019, according to the Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA). It has caused many destructive flooding in several lowlying parts of the country and landslides in the Mountanious parts of the Country. Destructive wind and hailstorms have ravaged plantations and crops across the whole country.

1.1 On Monday 2nd December rains began falling in the Mt Elgon subregion and several parts of the country at about 11.00 pm and continued upto 3.00 pm (15 hrs of rainfall) on Tuesday 3rd December. This heavy unusual rainfall followed a near daily rainfall for the past three Months of November, September and August.

1.2 It caused multiple landslides in the villages of Namasa, Naposhi and shukururu in Bushika subcounty of Bududa district killing 4 people, injuring 5 and displacing over 6,000 people (750 hhs). Review of villages households registers is ongoing to establish number and names of missing persons. Assessment of the number of hectares of houses, plantations, crop and livestock destroyed is also on-going.

1.3 In Sironko District, 2 adults and 2 children were killed in Nabodi village, Bumumulo Parish of Zesui subcounty. A rapid assessment established over 4,000 people (500 hhs) were affected and they lost hundreds of acres of plantations, crop and livestock. A detailed assessment is taking place to determine exact numbers of houses and livelihood assets were lost.

1.4 Multiple landslides / floods also occurred in the following subcounties of Sironko District; Bukise , Bumasifwa, Masaba, Bumalimba and Budadiri Town Council without deaths and injuries as most people in the affected areas had shifted earlier to safer locations.

1.5 River Manafwa a major river draining Mt Elgon burst its banks and washed away 25 houses downstream whose occupants had early heeded OPM alert messages and shifted to safer areas.

1.6 Sironko Town the Headquarters of Sironko District was flooded with water flowing along all streets and into houses, however, no person within the Town council was injured.

1.7 A number of villages in the districts of Bukedea, Serere, Ngora, Katakwi, Amuria, Kapelebyong, Tororo and Otuke are submerged, however, no injuries reported as residents had early shifted to safer locations.

1.8 Murchison falls got filled up submerging the tourist viewing rocks, protection fencing and access staircase.

1.9 River Nile cut off road transport to West Nile subregion when its submerged the road near Pakwach bridge.

1.10 The risk of more flooding and landslides is real.

1.11 Warning messages urging the population to keep away from river banks, and steep slopes are continuously being sent out.

1.12 People should not walk, or allow boda-boda riders and cars carry them across flooded section of roads and bridges.

1.13 Government has released shs 20.0 billion for emergency procurement of inflatable boats, tarpaulins, blankets, relief food, drugs for water borne diseases and culverts for fixing washed away bridges under the life-saving and rescue phase (Nov 2019- Jan 2020) of the flooding/landslides situation.

1.14 Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) will be conducted in January 2020 to determine total level of damage and losses and actions for the Recovery and Reconstruction.

1.15 A rapid assessment conducted in the most affected subregion - Mt Elgon ( Bududa, Sironko, manafwa, Namisidwa and Mbale puts the number of displaced persons at 25,000; affected households at 85,000 and damaged acreage of crop and plantations at 21,500 hectares.

1.16 The number displaced in the two subregions of Teso and Bukedi subregions stands at 55,000 people with over 120,000 hectares of crop destroyed. The population affected (not displaced) in these two subregions is bigger but the impact is comparatively lower compared to Bugisu.

1.17 Districts along the banks of river Nile in West Nile subregion have equally suffered losses of crop and homes to flooding. Assessments are on-going 1.18 Also affected are the hilly parts of the subregions of Kigezi and Rwenzori, and the low-lying district of Ntoroko.

1.19 The subregions of Buganda, Ankole, Bunyoro, Acholi, and Karamoja suffered more infrastructure losses (roads and bridges) and less livelihood ( plantations, crop and livestock) losses.

MITIGATION, PREPAREDNESS, RESPONSE ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENT AND THE COMMUNITY

1.20 The IGAD Climate Outlook is held Quarterly. It brings together National, Regional and International Climate Scientists and in that forum they forecast rainfall for the next three months.

1.21 The 53rd Forum for the Greater Horn of Africa Climate Outlook was held in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania from 26 th to 28th August 2019 for the period September to December, 2019.

1.22 Above normal rainfall was predicted.

1.23 Relevant sectors of government that would be affected positively and negatively were informed and they did preparations early.

1.24 On receipt of the Sept-Dec Forecast, The OPM Disaster Dept reviewed the satellite images of the landslides prone and risky areas of the subregions of the hilly Elgon and flat areas of the subregions of Teso and Bukedi.

1.25 Villages at high risk were physically visited and awareness and sensitization meetings held with persons at risk.

1.26 Safe homes in the neighbourhoods were identified and requested to accept to host households at risk for the period September – December 1.27 OPM provided hosting and hosted families with 200kgs of rice (China donation), 100 kgs of beans, 5 pcs of tarpaulins and 5 pieces of Mosquito nets.

1.28 Early warning messages were also run on TV stations, FM radio Stations, News Papers and SMS on phones.

1.29 As the rains began pouring, OPM acquired and stocked for rapid response: 100 roles of tarpaulins, 5,000 pieces of blankets, 5,000 pieces of sleeping-mats, 1,500 pieces of jerricans, 500 cartons of soap, 2,000 pieces of buckets and 2,000 pieces of spades.

1.30 National Emergency Coordination Center (NECOC) was fully activated to operate 24 hours to receive information from all parts of the country with a Toll Free line 0800177777.

1.31 Our partners from the Police, UPDF, UNRA, MoH, MWE and MAAIF were also stocked relevant disaster response requirements including rehearsals, culverts, waterborne treatment drugs, livestock treatment drugs etc.

1.32 The killer flooding and landslides is not a new disaster in this country, you will recall on 1st March 2010 a landslide disaster in Bulambuli District claimed the lives of over 150 people and displaced over 5,000.

1.33 Cabinet then directed two solutions (1) resettlement of the survivors in part of the Refugee settlement land in Kiryandongo and (2) long term solution for those at risk of future landslides.

1.34 The 5,000 survivors were all transferred and resettled in Kiryandongo. The number of Bagisu from Bududa resettled in Kiryandongo, however, has now increased to 10,300 people as many others voluntarily followed on their own and settled alongside those brought to Kiryandongo by Government. This is contrary to reports that most Bududa landslides survivors resettled in Kiryandongo have abandoned the place and gone back to their former homes in the risky steep slopes of Bududa because of alleged poor services.

1.35 In 2011, a standing Cabinet Subcommittee headed by Rt. Hon. 1st Deputy Prime Minister and Deputy Leader of Government Business in Parliament Gen. Moses Ali was appointed by Cabinet to established the population at high risk of landslides in the districts of Bududa, Sironko, Manafwa and Bulambuli.

1.36 The committee together with technical officers after three weeks of field work established that close to 100,000 people were at high risk of landslides and recommended their relocation to safer places, giving Bugisu sub region priority.

1.37 A ten year resettlement project for the 100,000 people (12,500hh) at risk of landslides was drawn and approved by Cabinet. It was entitled, ‘RESETTLEMENT OF LANDLESS PERSONS AND PERSONS AT RISK OF LANDSLIDES.’ The project was supposed to be implemented in a phased manner with on average 10,000 people each year.

1.38 The resettlement project, however, did not start in the year 2011 as had been planned because a few negative minded politicians from Bugisu subregion misled the population to resist the resettlement plan. 1.39 As a result, there was an eight-year delay in operationalization of the resettlement plan.

1.40 Implementation of the resettlement plan only resumed in November 2018, following a directive from H.E.The President and after another landslide had killed 53 people in Bukalasi subcounty of Bududa District.

1.41 The Engineering Brigade of UPDF, together with the Constructions Unit of the Uganda Police Force and the Mechanical Unit of Uganda Prison Services have managed to construct 241 houses of which the first 101 have been occupied and the 140 are at completion stages.

1.42 If the eight years of negative political mis-guidance had not occurred, by now the challenges of landslide would be minimal in Bugisu subregion.

1.43 This Bulambuli Resettlement Project is being implemented in three phases and will take a total of 7,200 people in 900 houses at its completion in June next year.

1.44 After the Bulambuli Project which is being implemented on Government land; the subsequent resettlement strategies will include identification and procurement of land for resettlement in safely locations within the districts of Bududa, Manafwa, Namisidwa, Sironko and Bulambuli. And in situations of places of high population densities and no land for purchase at subcounty level, the people at risk in such areas will be consulted and upon agreement be relocated to other parts of the Country.

1.45 The beneficiary families of the Bulambuli project, have each receive a permanent two-bedroomed house made of concrete blocks and iron-sheet roofs of gauge 28, sitting on one acre of land, piped water, solar and hydro power lighting.

1.46 The purpose of this media statement is to enable me appeal to the media, Hon Members of Parliament especially those from the most affected subregions of Bugisu Teso, Bukedi, Kigezi, Rwenzori, Lango and West Nile; Cultural Leaders, Opinion Leaders and all persons in leadership positions to convince our people to:

a. Desist from crossing walking across flooded sections of any road or bridge

b. Not to allow boda-boda riders and vehicle drivers carry them across sections of flooded roads and bridges

c. Shift from their homes located in risky steep slopes especially in Bugisu subregion to homes of relatives, friends, Churches, Mosques and School buildings, as a temporary emergency safety measure.

d. Government will continuously provide them with relief food while at those places of safety as it has done in the past. The above-normal rains are expected to subside within the next three weeks, i.e by end of December 2019, and people can then after begin going back to their homes.

1.47 On behalf of the Government, I convey condolences to families who have lost their dear members.","Sun, 08 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['landslides', 'resettlement', 'risk', 'rainfall', 'sironko', 'parts', 'subregions', 'govt', 'disaster', 'situation', 'affected', 'floods', 'uganda', 'speaks', 'bududa']",

Malteser International is preparing assistance for people affected in the Kasese district of western Uganda following the region’s worst flooding in almost 50 years. Days of torrential rains have triggered devastating floods that have caused four major rivers to burst their banks, forcing thousands from their homes and destroying roads, bridges and public buildings.

Laura Beutler, Technical Coordinator for Malteser International in Uganda, said: ""The largest hospital in Kasese has had to be evacuated, leaving people there without much-needed medical care. We will be sending eight ambulances and a medical team in support of health facilities in the district. A lack of urgent medical care would be catastrophic, especially under the present circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic.”

The floodwaters have damaged homes, latrines and water sources in Kasese district. Some 30,000 people are now homeless. “This disaster could have major implications for the COVID-19 response in the area,” said Beutler. “Those displaced have been forced to seek refuge in makeshift shelters where social distancing is practically impossible. The risk of COVID-19 spreading there is now high. To reduce the risk of infection, Malteser International will be providing daily access to clean water for up to 1,000 people affected by the flooding. We will also be working with our partners to provide information on safety measures against the novel coronavirus.”

Since late April, exceptional heavy seasonal rains have resulted in widespread across East Africa, killing nearly 300 people and causing a heavy loss of property. The disaster is compounding the risks to human health and food security from the COVID-19 pandemic and the worst locust infestation in decades.

For the past few days, it has been raining in many parts of the country and as is the unfortunate norm, whenever it rains, many areas including roads flood and are rendered impassable not to mention the destruction of property and sometimes lives. While we might not have control over the rain, we surely should be able to control the after effects.

Year after year, the country grapples with the problem of rain floods which are mainly caused by poor drainage systems, disregard of environmental guidelines such as erecting buildings in swampy areas that are prone to floods, poor garbage disposal which usually blocks drainage systems, in turn hindering passage of water, among others.

The Kampala Capital City Authority 2017 Kampala drainage master plan cites poor design and construction of drains, poor inter connectivity of drains, limited sensitisation of the public, unplanned settlements and poor enforcement mechanisms and mindsets of the people as some of the issues that affect drainage.

In Kampala for instance, the same areas keep flooding every time it rains heavily even for just a few hours, causing an aftermath of traffic jam and in unfortunate circumstances, accidents where people and vehicles are washed away by the floods.

Some of these areas include Industrial Area, where motorists can be seen daring the raging filthy water that takes over road space turning them into mini rivers. Since this is a recurring problem and is almost expected every year, it should be continually planned for and a lasting solution found.

The areas in different parts of the country that are prone to flooding should be identified before the rains start and a plan to prevent the effects of flooding be devised.

We shouldn’t have to keep crying foul about the same problem year in, year out as if it is impossible to solve. We could start with simple steps such as ensuring that man hole covers are intact as these have also been a death trap, especially when rain floods occur.

Then there’s the emphasis on the state of the drainage system. With well-planned and constructed drainage systems, we can alleviate floods.

As has been suggested before by many concerned and expert parties, these systems must undergo regular maintenance which includes unclogging and revaluating their ability and effectiveness to serve their purpose as the water volumes may keep increasing.

Better planning for urban settlement, harvesting rain water, respecting the natural water catchment areas are also probable steps to take.

While we appreciate that some work has been done to alleviate floods in some areas, more has to be done as the rain and consequent floods wait for no man.","Mon, 15 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.monitor.co.ug/resource/blob/3292088/9f8f53425beb42c7b5cb1151b22090c6/editpix-data.jpg,"['solution', 'areas', 'lets', 'kampala', 'lasting', 'drainage', 'rain', 'rains', 'floods', 'systems', 'water', 'poor', 'problem']",

People living in flooded areas or water lodged conditions are at risk of suffering from waterborne diseases like diarrhoea, dysentery, cholera, etc.

KALAKI - Rising water levels on Lake Kyoga have ravaged three sub-counties in Kalaki district, leaving over 1,400 people helpless.

Scores of residents have fled their homes for safety. Some stay with relatives, while others have rented small units in trading centres.

The LC1 chairperson of Akura village in Kakure sub-county, Kalaki district, Charles Ochung, said the water levels started rising five months ago, but residents did not take it seriously.

Ochung said the most affected sub-counties are Kalaki, Bululu and Kakure.

Florence Engoru, a resident of Akura village, said the rising waters have paralysed transport since roads have been cut off.

Engoru said children in candidate classes from the affected sub-counties were finding it hard to access schools and are worried about how they will sit their examinations.

Engoru said she realised earlier that water levels were going up and left the village before the situation could get worse.

Those who remained behind are now crying out for assistance to be evacuated as more homes get submerged.

Another resident, Rogers Ajaro, said pregnant mothers are finding it hard to access antenatal services and the nearby areas have started reporting cases of waterborne diseases.","Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['started', 'kalaki', 'subcounties', 'waterborne', 'rising', 'resident', 'residents', 'floods', 'uganda', 'water', 'levels', 'ravaged', 'village']",

• The June to September 2020 seasonal rains over the northern and western sector of the region were above average across much of the region. Devastating floods occurred at the peak of the rainfall season, affecting over 2.5 million people and causing significant crop damage in riverine areas in Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, Ethiopia,

Somalia, Uganda, and Kenya.

• Crop losses were significant in several riverine areas, including along the Awash River in Ethiopia, the While and Blue Nile Rivers in South Sudan and Sudan, and the Juba and Shabelle Rivers in Somalia.

Outside of flood-affected areas, the seasonal rains were generally beneficial for crop and livestock production, water availability, and hydro-power generation across East Africa. The water-levels in major lakes, rivers, and dams are among the highest on record, especially in the Lake Victoria basin, major Rift Valley lakes, and White and Blue Nile Rivers.

• Desert locust swarms continue to form, and breeding is underway in Ethiopia, north-central Somalia, Yemen, and eastern Sudan. The situation in Ethiopia is of high concern, where government and other sources report significant damage to meher crops in Amhara, Tigray, and Oromia regions.

• Rangeland resources and livestock production conditions are exceptionally above average across most pastoral and agropastoral regions of East Africa due to two consecutive rainfall seasons of above average rainfall performance since late 2019. However, atypically high disease prevalence and livestock deaths are reported in South Sudan due to severe floods in 2019 and 2020.

• The 1-2 weeks rainfall outlook depicts the gradual southward shift of the tropical rainfall system from the northern to equatorial sectors. This marks a timely onset of the seasonal rains in bimodal South Sudan and Uganda, while the rains will gradually subside and reduce the risk of associated flooding in Sudan, unimodal South Sudan, Yemen, and Ethiopia. However, much of eastern Horn is expected to remain sunny and dry, with a delayed and erratic onset of the short/deyr rains in eastern Ethiopia and southern Somalia.","Sat, 10 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539740-EAST_AFRICA_Seasonal_Monitor_2020_09_06_final.png?itok=kRTluo5N,"['africa', 'significant', 'south', 'seasonal', 'rainfall', 'livestock', 'rivers', '2020', 'east', 'yemen', 'monitor', 'ethiopia', 'sudan', 'rains', 'world']",

NAKASONGOLA- Flash floods have submerged a section of the Lwampanga Health Centre IV in Nakasongola District, paralysing normal operations at the maternity unit.

Currently, expectant mothers are unable to access antenatal services at the medical centre.

The floods have displaced about 717 people in the district and many of them are camping at schools and churches.

Nakasongola District Health Officer, Dr Agaba Byamukama, said at the weekend that water from the flooding Lake Kyoga has forced administrators of the health centre to temporarily shift particular services antenatal services to a safer area.

“The floods have partly inconvenienced normal service delivery because several families have been displaced and forced to seek shelter in areas that are far from the health centre,” Dr Agaba said.

He said that sanitation facilities like pit-latrines at the health facility have been flooded which could trigger water-borne diseases.","Mon, 06 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['health', 'hundreds', 'forced', 'nakasongola', 'dr', 'normal', 'district', 'services', 'displaced', 'floods', 'uganda', 'displace', 'centre', 'antenatal']",

Respective National Societies, with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), are working to respond to each of these disasters through different means. Some have Disaster Relief Emergency Funds (DREFs) or Emergency Appeals (EAs) launched, and others may require additional support in the future.

The situation

Within a month (August to September) 2020, more than 1.21 million people in 12 different countries have been affected by floods across Africa and many other countries are currently experiencing more widespread rainfall than usual in the long rain season leading to transboundary flooding in several areas. Countries most affected by floods during the last five weeks are; Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Kenya, Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Mali. More countries are in trajectories of being affected by floods during the monsoon season which will continue till November. A brief overview of the situation is given below:

In Sudan, 17 of the country's 18 states have been affected, with North Darfur, Sennar, West Ordofan, and Kassala being the worst affected. More than 0.5 million people have been affected and 99 people have lost their lives and over 100,000 houses have been damaged. Thirty-four (34) schools and 2,671 health facilities have also been damaged. It has also been stated that the magnitude of rain and floods this year exceeds the 1988 and 1946 floods. The affected families are seeking shelter with relatives and host communities. Following a meeting with the Council of Ministers, the Security and Defence Council in Sudan has declared a state of emergency for three months in the whole country and formation of a higher committee to mitigate the effects of the floods

In South Sudan, over 600,000 people were displaced by floods according to the United Nations (UN). Flooding along the White Nile has affected four counties in six states since July 2020. Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding in vast areas and settlements along the White Nile in the center of the country, with the states of Jonglei and Lakes being the worst affected. According to a Rapid Needs Assessment, priorities include water, purification tablets, plastic sheeting for temporary shelter, mosquito nets, fishing kits, and medicines for Malaria, Diarrhea and other waterborne diseases

In Kenya, rains led to the displacement of over 100,000 people and 194 people lost their lives. In Ethiopia, rains affected over 200,000 people and caused 8 deaths. Flooding in Uganda saw 5,000 people displaced and 6 deaths with 3,800 people on the Lake Islands in Mayuga District evacuated due to an increased water level in Lake Victoria.

According to the Niger Red Cross Society and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), in Niger, more than 88,000 people have been affected by floods in 8 regions of Niger – Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Niamey, Tahoua, Tillaberi and Zinder – with 33 deaths and 9,568 houses collapsed. Many people have been displaced and had to seek refuge in schools and host families.

In Chad, almost 120,000 people have been displaced by floods during the August 2020 rains. According to a report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 32,000 of those displaced were in N’Djamena, where 10 people lost their lives. Previously, 1,000 homes on the Maingama Site were damaged, forcing 430 households to flee their destroyed homes.

The Bunyoro Kitara Kingdom has called for the immediate relocation of all persons who were displaced by floods in the districts of Buliisa, Hoima, Kagadi and Kikuube.



More than 2000 homes have been submerged by floods from the rising water levels of Lake Albert in the four districts over the last nine months. Records show that up t0 38,000 people were displaced affected in Buliisa district alone, especially in the areas of Wanseko, Katanga, Kawaibanda, Butiaba, Boma, Kigangaizi, Tugombili and Walukuba.



Also affected are the areas of Bugoigo, Kamagongoro, Kigungu, Serule, Piida, Waisoki, Triangle and Magali in Butiaba Sub-county, Kabolwa and Kigoya landing sites in Kigoya sub-county. In Kagadi district, the floods have swept through the areas of Kabukanga, Rwebigongoro, Nkuse and Ndaiga.



Those affected in Hoima are Tonya, Kijangi, Kaiso, Rwentali, Hoimo, Fofo, Mbegu, Waaki and Kiryamboga among others, while the affected areas in Kikuube include Nkondo, Sebigoro, Ususa, Senjojo, Wangjok, Busiki and Nsonga.



Andrew Byakutaga, the Bunyoro Kitara Kingdom Prime Minister says the situation has gone out of hand, and that the government needs to intervene and save the lives of people that are now at risk. The flood victims are currently occupying churches and schools, whole others are sleeping in the cold.

Francis Kazini, the Kikuube LCV Chairperson wonders why the government has not taken appropriate action to have the flood victims relocated.



In August, The Bunyoro Kitara Kingdom petitioned the government to immediately extend relief food to thousands of people affected by floods in the region. The petition followed an assessment of the destruction undertaken across the various landing sites by Kingdom officials led by Byakutaga.","Wed, 11 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://ugandaradionetwork.net/a/helpers/image.php?fileId=234960&m=0&w=960&h=960,"['radionetwork', 'immediate', 'kitara', 'areas', 'bunyoro', 'victims', 'relocation', 'demands', 'landing', 'district', 'affected', 'floods', 'uganda', 'flood', 'wanseko', 'districts', 'buliisa', 'kingdom']",

• The March to May (MAM) rainfall period was one of the wettest the region has seen since 1981 (Figure 1), following an already record wet 2019 October to December (OND) rainfall period.

• The early onset of rains and above-average rainfall since February promoted land preparation and planting activities for the MAM season across Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, along with the Belg season in Ethiopia.

• However, the abundant rains have also caused localized flooding, mudslides, flashfloods, and river overflows over the past months causing casualties, population displacement, infrastructure damage, and crop damage in parts of Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and Yemen.

• Cropping conditions remain generally favourable as rains are expected to be beneficial to planting and crop development across much of the region; however, localized losses and crop damage are expected in areas worst affected by flooding (Figure 2).

• Abundant rains have also promoted the breeding and development of desert locusts and protracted the outbreak across the region, which continues to pose a significant threat to main season crops.

• Above-average rainfall is expected to continue across much of the region through May which will increase the flood risk across many areas and further protract the desert locust outbreak (See May Outlook Pg. 8).","Tue, 19 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1518254-Special_Report_East_Africa_202005.png?itok=2ce-Vf7E,"['africa', 'crop', 'rainfall', 'east', 'uganda', 'updated', 'flood', '2020', 'rains', 'tanzania', 'special', 'expected', 'season', 'report', 'damage', 'region', 'agriculture', 'impacts', 'somalia']",

Torrential rains have triggered devastating floods and landslides across East Africa in recent weeks, aggravating an already challenging situation as countries in the region battle the coronavirus pandemic.

The destruction caused by the heavy rainfall has killed hundreds of people in Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Rwanda and Ethiopia and has also forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.

This week, officials in Kenya and Rwanda said nearly 200 and 65 people had died in both countries, respectively, with floodwaters and mudslides destroying houses, washing away bridges and straining critical infrastructure.

On Saturday, Kenyan and Uganda suffered nationwide electricity outages, leaving tens of millions of people without power.

Health experts are worried about the implications of the flooding on the countries’ response to the coronavirus pandemic.

“This is compounding the COVID-19 response,” Kenya Health Ministry Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman said.

“The displaced people have been forced to congregate in makeshift camps with the risk of banding together exposing them to the possibility of contracting the virus.”

Floodwaters also recently swept away most parts of an entire small town in Somalia and swept away roads, bridges and a hospital in Uganda.

Heavy rains flooded areas around Mountain Rwenzori in western Uganda after Nyamwamba River burst its banks, forcing people to seek refuge in nearby schools and destroying roads and bridges, according to officials.

“What complicates the matter is that this is the era of COVID. People are expected to maintain social distance, but how do you maintain distance in such a situation?” Julius Mucunguzi, spokesman for the prime minister’s office, was quoted as saying by the Reuters News Agency.

One of the hospitals in the area, Kilembe, was also washed away despite being built on a raised bank and reinforced with sandbags.

“There are wards which were completely washed away. The mortuary was swept away. You wouldn’t know that once upon a time there was a mortuary there. The drugs and drug stores were washed away,” Mucunguzi said.

The Somali region in eastern Ethiopia has also been hard hit by the floods, with more than 100,000 people displaced, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

Meanwhile, an unspecified number of people were killed in the semi-autonomous Puntland region in Somalia when flash floods swept away most buildings in Qardho town, officials said.

The heavy rains stem from moisture dumped in the region by winds coming in from the Indian Ocean where temperatures have risen in recent months, said Chris Shisanya, a professor of climatology at Kenyatta University in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.

“This is a carry-over of what we had last year,” he said, referring to floods and landslides in the region.

The floods are coming as swarms of locusts are wreaking havoc across East Africa where millions of people struggle for food.

Billions of desert locusts have already chomped their way through Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti, Eritrea, Tanzania, Sudan and Uganda.

Their breeding has been spurred by one of the wettest rainy seasons in the region in four decades.","Sat, 09 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5e5b9d1d53694cb7927899e63b9abf77_18.jpeg?fit=998%2C562,"['somalia', 'kenya', 'devastating', 'east', 'countries', 'region', 'african', 'losses', 'away', 'rains', 'floods', 'count', 'ethiopia', 'displaced', 'swept', 'washed']",

The rising water levels of River Nile, which started in June, have left Obongi Landing Site and the neighbouring Obongi Town Council submerged.

By last Thursday, floods had submerged nearly half of Obongi Town, filling more than 100 homes, the town's main mosque, shops and primary schools.

The water has also cut off the road connecting Obongi to Moyo and Adjumani districts.

""Livestock such as cows, goats and chicken have died in the floods while very many remain stranded,"" Mr Taban Data, the Adjumani Resident District Commissioner (RDC), said at the weekend.

Area leaders and residents say they last experienced such flooding in 1964 when the then Obongi County suffered severe flooding, which submerged up to five kilometres of land from the original banks of River Nile.

The district authorities have warned of a potential rise in the water levels and asked residents in the low-lying areas to vacate.

""The water is claiming where exactly it used to be some years back and we have asked residents to leave that area because no one knows if the water levels may recede soon since the floods have persisted for long now,"" Mr Goffin Gore, the Obongi RDC, said at the weekend.

He added that people started settling on the banks of River Nile that are demarcated as wetlands without authorisation.

According to the district disaster management committee, 118 homesteads with nearly 380 people have been displaced by the floods.

Mr Gore said the district disaster management committee has petitioned the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), seeking its intervention. According to him, flood victims lack basic necessities such as food, clean water and accommodation.

Two of its biggest plants, the 180-megawatt Nalubaale and 200-megawatt Kiira plants outside Jinga, are being battered by rising flood waters and floating papyrus.

On April 14, a floating mass of papyrus mats (used across Lake Victoria and now cast afloat like islands) crunched into the dam wall. Bits of papyrus were sucked into the turbines. The country was plunged into a blackout as around 20% of the grid’s capacity suddenly went offline.

The story of that moment started six months earlier, in October, when it started raining in Uganda. It hasn’t stopped since. Lake Victoria’s levels have risen by 1.3m and are just 8cm away from their highest-ever level. Similar downpours filled the lake in the early 1960s and mid 1990s.

With 23 rivers feeding the lake and only one exit, past Jinga and into the Nile, Lake Victoria is perfect for hydropower. To help alleviate the pressure, the amount of water being released at Jinja has more than doubled.

But this isn’t just an issue of too much rain. Human expansion has played a large role.

In a press release detailing the government response, Uganda’s water and environment minister, Sam Cheptoris, said a loss of forest cover as well as encroachment on wetlands and river banks meant that there was more silt in the lake and fewer natural barriers to fast-flowing flood waters. Towns and roads also mean more cement and tar, so rainwater doesn’t soak into the ground and instead goes straight into rivers.

The higher water levels have meant jetties and landing sites being submerged, leading to a halt in ferries. The floating mats have also become a hazard to other shipping; so vital to local economies. Resorts, hotels and homes have been flooded. The flooding is also affecting Lake Kyoga, with flooding at a much lower level in Lake Albert.

Cheptoris noted that drinking water and sanitation systems have also been affected by the deluge, with a likely increase in water-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, malaria and bilharzia.

In response to the crisis, Cheptoris said the government will “remove” anyone encroaching on water bodies and forests. Chiefs who have not taken “action against encroachers” will also be dismissed.

By John Marsham and colleagues

A year of exceptional rainfall, floods and locust outbreaks is decreasing the resilience of vulnerable populations in East Africa just at the time of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The combination of these disasters is not random, as the floods, lake level and locusts can all been linked to climate change.

Covid-19 is a zoonotic virus, which means it has been transmitted from animals to humans. The illegal global trade in wild animals (notably Pangolins, which are largely exported to China) has been directly damaging East Africa’s ecology for years and, even if not yet proven to be the case for Covid-19, such trade increases the chance of zoonotic pandemics.

Water levels of Lake Victoria have just reached the highest point ever in the 120 year record, displacing thousands and flooding infrastructure.

Other floods in the region have displaced tens of thousands of people and killed hundreds. The locust outbreak is the worst in 70 years and may, according to the UN, grow 400-fold by June.

Combined, these increase vulnerability and reduce the ability of the population to engage in social distancing and to practise basic hygiene just as the Covid-19 crisis hits East Africa.

The Lake Victoria basin is home to around 40 million people. The lake is the largest tropical lake in the world and its outflow is a major hydropower source.

The lake has major cities of around 5 million people on its shores, including Kampala, the capital of Uganda.

Lake Victoria is unusual in that it receives most of its water directly from rainfall, not from rivers, and loses most by evaporation, rather than through its outflow: the lake level has varied by around 3m over the last 120 years.

The rise in Lake Victoria levels is one of the fastest on record. East Africa has experienced major flooding since October 2019.

The exceptional 2019 rainfall was caused by warm waters in the western Indian Ocean (called a positive “Indian Ocean Dipole”, which also contributed to the Australian fires). Together with effects of tropical cyclones and westerlies between October and December this led to the Lake Victoria basin experiencing 150 to 200% of its usual rainfall.

January and February 2020 also had above average rain, possibly related to persistent warm water in the western Indian Ocean. Climate change is expected to have increased the probability of these events and so the rapid lake level rise. March to May 2020 have seen further heavy rainfall, pushing up lake levels to the near record-breaking level.

Although we do expect climate change to favour such rapid rises in lake level, it is too early to say for certain whether we expect climate change to give higher or lower lake levels overall in the long term.

It is clear though that water management plans must plan for changes due to climate change, such as the recent rapid rise.

The fact that Lake Victoria spans three nations, and is a source of the White Nile that then supplies water to South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt, means that plans for Lake Victoria have international implications, so agreements and plans should be made well in advance, to allow adequate time to address the complex issues this will raise.

Climate change will continue to intensify rainfall and flood management must adapt.

The event illustrates how ‘natural disasters’, sometimes enhanced by climate change, are often interconnected. The exceptional rain of 2019/2020 has led to flooding directly from the rainfall, as well as from rivers and the lake, and has been linked to disease outbreaks.

The weather has affected crop growth and food prices, and has contributed to the locust outbreak. People in the region are suffering impacts of these events and Covid-19 simultaneously, or in quick succession, reducing their ability to cope, and acute food insecurity is growing.

Projected impacts of climate change on populations and ecosystems, and plans to increase resilience, must account for such systematic sequences of inter-connected events, as well as random sequencing of unrelated disasters.

The work reported on in this story is part of two projects: (1) FCFA’s HyCRISTAL project (funded by DFID and NERC) which is working to both improve climate information for East Africa, and use this to inform long-term decision making in the region, (2) HyTpp (funded by DFID, through the Corridors for Growth Trust Fund administered by the World Bank), which is analysing possible Lake Victoria water levels under climate change.

More than 150 families, part of the 10,000 people who were displaced by the floods two years ago after water levels in Lake Albert rose, are living in a dire condition.

The lives of many locals who have gathered in Kanara Sub-county, Ntoroko District near Lake Albert, are being threatened since the temporal houses erected in water are on the verge of collapsing. The families are also in dire need of food and other essential basic needs.

The unstable houses, made of iron sheets, and reeds are being held by timber poles erected in water, some of which are rotting away and can no longer hold their weight.

Mr Justice Kabagambe,46, a resident of Kamuga Village in Kanara Sub-county, Ntoroko District, one of the affected people, in April last year erected a temporary house above the water after his house that is a few metres away from the shores of Lake Albert, was submerged by floods.

Following the incident, he joined another family whose house was submerged days later. “I decided to build a temporary four-room house where I am staying with my family,” he said.

“The family is not sure of a single meal in a day but we get support from friends and well-wishers. My house is not stable and it shakes whenever it gets windy, especially at night, we fear it may collapse,” Mr Kabagambe added.

Mr Kabagambe’s house is surrounded by 40 others in the same condition. The houses are hard to access and one has to use a boat as a means of transport to visit friends and family members settled away from the flooded area. Similarly, food and other requirements are transported by boat from the dry areas. The operators of the few available boats demand a fee for their services.

There are a few makeshift shops built above the flooded areas. Mr Kabagambe’s family is forced to keep indoors since they have no compound.

The communities also lack clean water for domestic use and are forced to draw contaminated water from the lake.

The families lack toilets too and are forced to defecate in the water. “We use the same water to ease ourselves since our toilets and tap stands were submerged,” Mr Kabagambe said.

His plight is shared by more than 150 families who have found shelter above the water.

The sub-counties that are mostly affected include Kamuga, Kachwakumu and Rwangara. The affected families are, however, holding on to hope that the government will come to their rescue.

Those who were displaced in 2019 and later in 2020, were first sheltered in nearby schools of Umoja, Rwangara and Kachwakumu, which were later submerged. The floods left homes, shops, schools, gardens and health facilities submerged.

Last year when the State minister for Disaster Preparedness and Refugees, Mr Musa Ecweru, and other officials visited the area, local leaders requested government to relocate them to Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve.

Current situation

The chairperson of Kachwakumu Village, Mr Rwaheru Byaruhanga, said while some people sought refuge with friends and family, others have nowhere to go.

He said more than 200,000 houses are still submerged and only rooftops are seen floating on top of water. “People spend days indoors and school-going children have not reported to school because their schools were submerged. Our people have also risked their lives because any time, these makeshift houses may collapse. They will also contract disease because they use contaminated water,” Mr Byaruhanga said.

Lack of food

Ntoroko District’s main economic activity is fishing and cattle keeping. The livelihood of locals was greatly hit since the floods affected livestock farming.

Accessing health centres is also a big challenge and they have to hire boats to reach Butungama or Rwebisengo sub-county for medical service. The nearby Rwangara Health Centre III was submerged.

Dr James Kato, the officer-in-charge of Rwebisengo Health Centre III, said they have to travel long distances to pick drugs.

Mr Byaruhanga said since 2019, they have been requesting the government to relocate them to Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve.

The chairperson of Kanara Sub-county, Mr Friday Mugiisa, said they have never received any relief food.

“People who are stuck in floods have no food to eat and they have been depending on fish. Last month, the UPDF fishing unit on Lake Albert destroyed all boats after accusing our people of illegal fishing,” Ms Mugiisa said.

The Ntoroko County Member of Parliament, Mr Gerald Rwemurikya Ibanda, last year told Daily Monitor that the government had promised to relocate the displaced people and settle them at Tooro Semliki Wildlife Reserve. This has not been fulfilled.

“The acres they are talking about are not enough, but sadly, they haven’t been availed to the people,” he said.

The acting chairperson of Ntoroko District, Mr Ben Muthahinga, said they recently received some relief items such as beans, posho and blankets from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), which they want to distribute to displaced people.

He said last week, the Minister for Tourism, Mr Tom Butiime, was in the area to discuss the relocation plan.

Mr Butiime confirmed that he visited Rwebisengo Town Council and held a meeting with local leaders and they agreed that Uganda Wildlife Authority reduces the restrictions on cattle keepers so that they can graze their animals in certain parts of the park.

He said the restrictions will only be applicable for farmers who have cattle but not for people who want to construct shelters in the park.

The Tourism boss also said the affected locals are being registered by the sub-county chief and they will soon be allowed to graze in the park.

Mr Julius Muchunguzi, the head of communications at the OPM, said: “The government is in the process of identifying land where the affected people can be relocated to. We have been supporting them with relief food.”

More than 10,000 people who were displaced by the recent floods in Kasese District face starvation amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Kasese District Covid-19 taskforce is facing a hard time enforcing the Ministry of Health and Presidential directives aimed at stemming the spread of the pandemic in the 27 camps.

Kasese District was on May 7 and 22 hit by floods when five rivers; Lhubiriha, Mubuku, Nyamwamba, Nyamughasana and Sebwe burst their banks and affected communities in seventeen sub-counties as well as Bulembia and Nyamwamba Divisions in Kasese Municipality.

Speaking to Daily Monitor in an interview at the weekend, Mr Joshua Kisembo Masereka, the Kasese Deputy Resident District Commissioner, said the state of people living in camps scattered across various sub-counties is appalling.

“Those living in camps are traumatised and are faced with emotional and mental stress emanating from the losses they registered at an individual level,” he said.

The camps housing stranded people include; Kanyangeya, Nkaiga and Kiraro primary schools having the highest number of people concentrated in one place.

When *Daily Monitor *visited one of the camps at Kiraro Primary School, no one was seen wearing a facemask.\ Despite presence of a hand washing facility that the taskforce have improvised, no one was seen washing hands.

Mr Peter Mutooro, the camp chairperson, said they have failed to enforce the directives against Covid-19 because they are facing hunger.

""Because of Covid-19, we have started decongesting families to the nearby churches and schools so that they reduce on the numbers,"" said Mr Mutooro.

Ms Harriet Kabugho, who chairs the committee overseeing affairs for girls within the camp, said their rights as girls were being violated every day. She explained that five of her friends have been sexually harassed by the boys within the same camp.

""We do not have bathrooms, we use the same latrines and we might contract sexually transmitted diseases,"" Ms Kabugho said.

The coordinator for Centre for Gender Quality, a non-governmental organisation based in Kasese town, Ms Jolly Mbambu, advised that people who are living in camps need to be resettled.

""This will not be the first time government is resettling flood victims. It was properly done during the Bududa landslides saga,"" Ms Mbambu said.

Damage

A tentative impact assessment by the district disaster committee that was presented to the State Minister for Disaster Preparedness, Mr Musa Ecweru, in May indicates that a total of 123,800 people, most of them women and children from more than 24,760 households have been directly affected by the floods.

The most affected areas include Kilembe, Karambi, Bugoye, Maliba, Mpondwe Lhubiriha Town Council, Karusandara, Kyarumba, Mubuku Town Council and the three divisions of Kasese Municipality.","Mon, 08 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flash-flood.png,"['living', 'town', 'starvation', 'mr', 'victims', 'district', 'covid19', '10000', 'kasese', 'affected', 'camps', 'uganda', 'ms', 'washing', 'face', 'flood']",

The landslides hit several sub-counties with most affected being Buwali and Bukalasi/Bundesi, Bumayoka and parts of Bubiita in the lower stream being affected by flash floods. As a direct consequence of these heavy rains, a total of four (4) major landslides occurred in Bududa: one in Bumayoka subcounty, one in Bukalasi/ Bundesi and two in Buwali. The landslides caused six (6) deaths, and injuries to 27 persons (13 males & 14 females) with all still admitted at Bududa Hospital. Amongst the injured, two (2) are children under 5 years (1 male and 1 female). First rapid assessments identified eighty (80) households as displaced (480 people), out of the 100 affected households and 669 people affected. In the neighbouring Sironko District, along the Mount Elgon slope, a devastating flood incident occurred in Buyobo Sub-County on 4th of June at around 4:00am. The continuous rains that started at 2:20am and continued consecutively for hours triggered flooding from uphill, which carried a huge mass of soil down the hills into river Bugibuni, prompting it to burst its banks and causing havoc to the communities downhill. The river carried massive water, logs of huge trees, soil debris down the slope and swept off houses and crops adjacent to it. The flash floods damaged houses of 111 households, with a population of 426 persons. Fortunately, no deaths were registered. Crops, merchandise, animals and properties worth millions of shillings were destroyed by the floodwaters. (IFRC, 24 Jun 2019)

Several landslides and floods across Bulambuli District (eastern Uganda) have resulted in 1 death and 19 missing. The most affected areas include Nabiwutulu, Gimadu Bugatiisa, and Buluganya Counties. The Uganda Red Cross Society is conducting an assessment to establish magnitude of the disaster and the needs of the people affected. Eastern Uganda was already affected by a series of landslides in early June this year, when at least 5 died. Moderate to locally heavy rain is forecast across most of Uganda on 2-3 September.

As we conclude the celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, lets remind ourselves about cities across the globe that have been designed to embrace livable and sustainable human settlement while putting a comparison with Uganda’s capital that poses as a flopped state seeking emergence renaissance. A ‘1.7 million people City’ seated on 189 square kilometers gives an average density of 8994 persons per square kilometer approximately (UBOS data 2019), with numerous hills and beautiful sceneries that have attracted the largest number of Ugandan elites.

The uncontrolled organic urban development taking pace on the look of urban authorities that has rendered ex-green belts, swamps and public harbours susceptible to a risk of being eaten up by human activities. The increasing land value in the city centre is sending away the urban poor and directing them to settling in wetlands and other protected areas due to lack of alternatives.

Kampala has for a longtime proved to be a city with imbalances between population growth and settlement patterns. It is a place of sarcastic and adverse urban development, city-wide decay and low rate of response to emergencies. Pavements and rooftops mean that less rainwater can soak into the ground. The pattern of streets and buildings has interrupted some of the natural drainage ways and reduced the width of some channels. As a result, more water runs off more quickly, and the drainage system has often become overloaded.

The city is majorly challenged with lack of hydraulic and hydrological-related data where it has failed to manage a clear record of its rainfall amounts, wetland distribution, drainage systems and general water flows data, uncontrolled urban expansion, abandoned buildings, illegal connections of sewage into the separate drainage network, and great amounts of sediments and organic matter which decrease the performance of the drainage facilities, lack of legal instruments and difficulty to approve new legislation, urban planning restrictions, institutional and political problems, opposition by the population, designers and public managers.

Additionally, it’s identified with overlooked scramble and partitioning of land within the wetlands hence bleeding with limited space for catchment of storm water. Land managers spearhead wetland destruction through personalisation and issuing of land titles in these vulnerable places.

The notion, “water is life” is gradually decelerating in the city centre since a dream of a heavy rain is a nightmare to many. The manner in which wetland resources have been depleted is a disgrace to the face of urban planning as a profession and provokes ridiculers into questioning the prevailing urban management systems. The massive erosion, silting of drainage channels, poor waste management as well as reclamation all contribute to this ‘city of floods.’

Natives interpret the status quo as a normal phenomenon that seasonally comes and goes, forgetting the long-term consequences that are left behind. People seem not to be bothered because after a flood wash, business resumes ordinarily.

The urban authority in-charge of the city alleges that it formulated a drainage master plan to curb the flood and its effects which has been challenged with limited funding and skilled workmanship. The drainage master plan that was formulated in 2003 was a way of directing storm water that increased steadily due to the reduction in the green spaces that have been pressurised by the ever-increasing population.

Until now its workability is questioned. This has overtime hyped the concern of many government bodies including the National Physical Planning Board that has responded by cautioning the city managers to take concern of the known flooding, housing and planning challenges to ensure improved livelihoods for the citizens. The challenges of excess storm water management in Kampala can be wrapped under one theme “lack of an operational and easily implementable urban and environmental master plan”.

In 2016, an Italian based consultancy firm specialised in water and land scape designing called “SGI Studio Galli Ingegneria” was contracted to review the 2003 Kampala Drainage Master Plan to check its operationability, its challenges and to pledge a way forward, a project that lasted for five months.

As a result, different additions were observed and taken onboard. It has also been noted with great concern that drainage has been given priority under KIIDP 2, a project that supports Kampala City improvement through world bank funding. However, it is ironical to say that with all such consideration, the drainage system has continued to smack as the biggest challenge that the ‘country’s capital’ battles with especially during a heavy rain.

The central government’s silence over the castrophe makes one to think that there is a ‘burning solution’ that is being planned indoors that is yet to be unveiled, only to hear tales. Kampala metropolitan is a home of numerous wetlands including Bwaise, Ndeeba, Katwe, Nakivubo, Namasuba among others but soon will be living in a shadow of its glamorous natural resources as more swamps continue to be reclaimed.

The city of floods is this town that has been built on wetlands without safeguards to stormwater/flooding and yet city buildings and infrastructure seat on former water catchment arenas. Therefore, city wide developments should be established in a manner that advocates for the wellbeing of natural resources, drainage channels should be reconstructed, waste should be properly disposed at household level, buildings close to drainage channels should have paved compounds as ways of controlling blockages in stormwater flow.

Management of a flood wash should be handled by respective risk management committees at local council level, maintain records of the people/areas affected and have constant checkups and monitoring tours within these sections but most importantly to utilize the use of a GIS system to predict future hazards.

Finally, the city authority must perceive the fact that people settling in these low-lying areas are to stay with the flood until our contemporary political and budgetary system support proper urban planning.

Enforcement of non-structural planning laws is particularly challenging due to the physically extensive informal housing in wetlands which is exacerbated by political, policy, and socioeconomic arrangements.

“There may not be enough time to prepare after you are notified of a flood watch…” (Boulder, 2002). Therefore, urban managers should also empower communities to maintain their drainage systems, through regular inspection and cleaning of drains, an important task that can be performed without specialized skills.

Mr Rahim Lubadde is a physical planner.

61,61,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Massive flooding latest crisis to hit East Africa - Crux Now,https://cruxnow.com/church-in-africa/2020/10/massive-flooding-latest-crisis-to-hit-east-africa/,"YAOUNDÉ, Cameroon – East Africa has been suffering a series of intense floods that have affected an estimated 6 million people.

The natural disaster is just one of several challenges facing the region, including continuing invasions by locust swarms and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Countries affected include Rwanda, Kenya, Somalia, Burundi, Ethiopia, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti and Tanzania.

“In some areas, the lack of infrastructure or damage to roads, bridges and airstrips has made accessing flood zones far more difficult, which in turn makes it more difficult to provide assistance,” said Matt Davis, the East Africa regional director of the Catholic Relief Services.

He told Crux the crises affecting East Africa can all be linked back to climate change.

“To help prevent floods in the future and mitigate the impact, we need to make more concerted efforts to preserve and restore watersheds and landscapes. We need to support communities to improve their livelihoods while restoring and maintaining the natural environment,” Davis said.

What follows are excerpts of his conversation with Crux.

Crux: Widespread flooding has once again hit East Africa. Can you give us a sense of the enormity of the disaster?

Davis: East Africa has been experiencing torrential rains and flooding since July and almost six million people have been impacted. Around 1.5 million people have lost their homes or have been displaced by the floods and many areas are still underwater. People’s homes, crops, livestock and personal possessions have been washed away, and there has been significant damage to infrastructure.

This is all happening before the start of the short rains, which should peak in November. In some areas, the lack of infrastructure or damage to roads, bridges and airstrips has made accessing flood zones far more difficult, which in turn makes it more difficult to provide assistance. This flooding is putting hardship upon hardship for people in the region, who have also been impacted by COVID-19 and pests like desert locusts.

Catholic Relief Services is on the ground working with local partners and national governments to distribute emergency food and other necessities. Working in partnership, we’ve been providing life-saving assistance to tens of thousands of people across affected areas.

However, there is an urgent need for more funding to ensure that basic needs continue to be met, and to prevent the spread of malaria and other waterborne diseases. Though our response varies country-by-country, we are generally support families with food, water, shelter, basic essentials, sanitation, and providing cash or vouchers which in turn supports the local economy. We also support health systems to address things like malnutrition and other health-related risks. In some areas, families receive seeds, tools and fishing kits so they can have a livelihood and feed themselves.

How do these flood compare to previous flooding in the region?

Even if you just look at the floods over the last four years, the impacts and the number of people affected have grown exponentially. From Ethiopia to South Sudan to Uganda, we’re seeing communities that year after year are impacted by both floods as well as recurring drought in some places.

Our staff in various countries often comments on how weather patterns have changed, or how rain is erratic. They also say that this is the worst flooding they have seen in decades.

Many environmentalists and other experts are blaming climate change.

The locust swarms, floods, recurring drought and COVID-19 all link back to climate change in some way, and East Africa in particular is feeling the effects.

To help prevent floods in the future and mitigate the impact, we need to make more concerted efforts to preserve and restore watersheds and landscapes. We need to support communities to improve their livelihoods while restoring and maintaining the natural environment. Alternatives to charcoal, a big reason for deforestation, need to be scaled up and promoted more widely. We also have to prioritize to support communities to protect forests and plant trees.

It’s difficult to protect against some of the risks, but there are measures that can be taken to help people cope with disasters like droughts and floods that have been made worse by climate change.

For example, it’s important to ensure that people live far enough away from rivers and channels to prevent disasters like flash flooding and landslides while also better managing excess runoff.

In East Africa, we’re increasing our efforts toward landscape restoration and re-greening while at the same time providing people with a more diverse set of income opportunities and training on how to be better prepared should disaster strike.

As you said, the floods are coming amid the COVID-19 pandemic and a series of locusts swarms. This really is a triple crisis.

The combined impacts of the floods, recurrent drought, conflict, desert locust swarms, COVID-19 and the pandemic-related economic downturn are making it really hard for people to recover. Like here, months-long lockdowns also mean that many people in the region haven’t been able to work, thus losing their ability to put food on the table.

For governments and humanitarian organizations like CRS, this also creates additional strain on already scarce resources. For example, the teams sent out to manage pests like desert locusts have to take additional precautions because of coronavirus. In some remote areas, people have not even heard of the coronavirus and are not aware of the potential risk. There are a lot of misconceptions, creating more risk for frontline workers.

Early on when COVID-19 emerged as a threat in the region, we adjusted how we interacted with project participants so we could continue to provide critical support while adhering to the necessary safety precautions. So, while we had to adapt quickly, we have also largely managed to continue our emergency responses, like food or cash distributions, for example.

For example, in South Sudan, we haven’t been able to do food air drops because airstrips have been flooded. And hunger is growing because farmland is flooded, too.

In terms of COVID-19, overall, our donors have been really flexible and supportive, encouraging us to continue to provide critical support in the communities where we work. That said, funding for a large-scale COVID-19 response has not really materialized, so communities have mostly had to make do with what they had, and weather the pandemic as best they can.","Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cruxnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1000-3-5.jpeg,"['africa', 'crisis', 'food', 'support', 'east', 'massive', 'covid19', 'hit', 'communities', 'need', 'floods', 'flooding', 'latest', 'difficult']",

Ntoroko District's main economic activity is fishing and cattle keeping. The livelihood of locals was greatly hit since the floods affected livestock farming.

Accessing health centres is also a big challenge and they have to hire boats to reach Butungama or Rwebisengo sub-county for medical service. The nearby Rwangara Health Centre III was submerged.

Dr James Kato, the officer-in-charge of Rwebisengo Health Centre III, said they have to travel long distances to pick drugs.

Mr Byaruhanga said since 2019, they have been requesting the government to relocate them to Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve.

The chairperson of Kanara Sub-county, Mr Friday Mugiisa, said they have never received any relief food.

""People who are stuck in floods have no food to eat and they have been depending on fish. Last month, the UPDF fishing unit on Lake Albert destroyed all boats after accusing our people of illegal fishing,"" Ms Mugiisa said.

The Ntoroko County Member of Parliament, Mr Gerald Rwemurikya Ibanda, last year told Daily Monitor that the government had promised to relocate the displaced people and settle them at Tooro Semliki Wildlife Reserve. This has not been fulfilled.

""The acres they are talking about are not enough, but sadly, they haven't been availed to the people,"" he said.

The acting chairperson of Ntoroko District, Mr Ben Muthahinga, said they recently received some relief items such as beans, posho and blankets from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), which they want to distribute to displaced people.

He said last week, the Minister for Tourism, Mr Tom Butiime, was in the area to discuss the relocation plan.

Mr Butiime confirmed that he visited Rwebisengo Town Council and held a meeting with local leaders and they agreed that Uganda Wildlife Authority reduces the restrictions on cattle keepers so that they can graze their animals in certain parts of the park.

He said the restrictions will only be applicable for farmers who have cattle but not for people who want to construct shelters in the park.

The Tourism boss also said the affected locals are being registered by the sub-county chief and they will soon be allowed to graze in the park.

Mr Julius Muchunguzi, the head of communications at the OPM, said: ""The government is in the process of identifying land where the affected people can be relocated to. We have been supporting them with relief food.""","Tue, 13 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['floodaffected', 'family', 'ntoroko', 'living', 'plight', 'house', 'submerged', 'dangerously', 'subcounty', 'families', 'affected', 'uganda', 'water', 'houses', 'wildlife', 'mr']", 
63,63,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Uganda: Flood Victims Hosted At Schools Stranded As Candidates Return - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/202010050623.html,"People who were displaced by rising water levels in Lake Kyoga and settled at various public schools in Nakasongola District are pondering their next move after government announced plans to reopen schools for candidate classes.

The flood victims from 18 fishing landing sites totaling up to 1,800 have been hosted at the public schools since April while others are sleeping in churches.

""We are unsettled as district leaders because we must have a relocation plan for families that are currently hosted at the public schools because they will open for candidate classes on October 15 as planned by government,"" Mr Sam Kigula, the Nakasongola District chairperson, said in an interview last Saturday.

""We have received relief items, including the food and some tarpaulins, two times since the month of May but our worry now is about families that are staying at the different public schools,"" he added.

Mr Kigula revealed that they had hoped that the flood victims would be resettled on Kyalubanga Central Forest Reserve land as directed by President Museveni but the process is very slow.

Ms Margaret Komuhangi, the district Woman Member of Parliament, named some of the schools hosting the flood victims as Katuba Primary School, Busone Primary School and Kimaga Primary school.

""As leaders in Nakasongola, our plans are for a permanent relocation of the flood victims but the fact that some of the families now occupy school premises, which candidates are going to use, is a big concern,"" Ms Komuhangi told Daily Monitor.

""The children cannot share the same space with the displaced families because of the Covid-19 guidelines, including many other social problems that make such schools not fit for the candidate classes,"" she added.

Nabiswera Sub-county chairperson David Sserubombwe said many parents in his area are wondering how their children in candidate classes will attend schools currently hosting the displaced families.

""We have about 40 households that have camped at Katuba Primary School since April. We are yet to get information from the relevant government departments on how the children will mix up with the families whose members move out to look for the basics, including food, and return to the school,"" Mr Sserubombwe explained.

But Local Government minister Raphael Magyezi in an interview explained that government has a relocation plan where different districts that have displaced flood victims were tasked to identify some free public land for their permanent relocation.

""Let me find out from my commissioner the current status for Nakasongola District. I will brief you by Monday [today],"" Mr Magyezi said.

Meanwhile, a section of other people displaced by rising water levels in

Lake Victoria have started returning to their homes despite concerns about their safety.

Between March and June, thousands of people occupying the lake shores and some islands were displaced after water submerged various landing sites in various districts near Lake Victoria. Since then, the victims have been temporarily housed in makeshift houses on the mainland.

Government had directed local leaders in the affected districts to look for public land where flood victims can permanently be resettled. However, before government implements the planned resettlement, some victims have started returning to their homes, claiming the program has delayed.

Masaka District alone has close to 20,000 flood victims who were displaced from the landing sites of Lambu, Kaziru, Kisuku , Malembo and Kachanga in March. ""Government should allow us return to the landing sites because it has no clear programme for us,"" Mr Samuel Ssemwanga, a fisherman at Lambu Landing Site, said.

According to Mr Willy Lugoloobi, the Kalangala District chairperson, the district has not received any assistance from government to resettle the displaced people.

""Good enough the water levels are now going down, and those who want to go back can start moving, but they should keep away from the protected buffer zones,"" Mr Lugoloobi said.

Landing sites that were affected in Kalangala include Kaaya, Ssemawundo and Kitobo in Bufumira Sub-county, and Senero, Kasekulo and Kaazi Malanga in Mugoye Sub-county

In Jinja the story is not different. Those displaced from three Islands of Wabitooke, Samoka, Kisima I and Kisima II have also started returning to their homes as water levels recede.

Mr Andrew Musana, a councilor representing Walukuba and Masese in Jinja South Division, said the fishermen who have started returning risk losing their lives.

""As local leaders, we wrote letters to government to help resettle those people but we have not got a response yet. It will be risky for those people to return to those islands and government should swiftly work out a clear resettlement plan for them,"" he said.

64,64,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Drowned land: hunger stalks South Sudan's flooded villages - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/mar/19/drowned-land-hunger-stalks-south-sudans-flooded-villages,"After the unprecedented floods last summer, the people of Old Fangak, a small town in northern South Sudan, should be planting now. But the flood water has not receded, the people are still marooned and now they are facing severe hunger.

Unusually heavy rains began last July, and the White Nile burst its banks, destroyed all the crops and encroached on farms and villages, affecting Jonglei and other states, leaving people to scramble for a few strips of dry land.

Fields are still submerged, mud homes and stiff sticks of dead maize are slowly collapsing into the water, entire villages have been abandoned and large areas turned into swamps. Of the 62 villages served by Old Fangak’s central market, 45 are devastated by the flooded river.

The July harvest would have fed the local people through to this spring but all the crops were lost. Families sleep in abandoned schools or in the open on scraps of higher land. There is no question of migrating to dry areas as the flood extends for miles and at least Old Fangak is secluded from the constant conflict that besets much of the rest of the country.

The UN says that about 1.6 million people have been affected by the floods in a country where already at least 7.5 million people need assistance. A recent report by the Integrated food security Phase Classification, (IPC), an initiative by 15 organisations to tackle malnutrition, estimates that 6.4 million people, about half the population, will face acute food insecurity in 2021, and for half of them their lack of food will be an emergency.

Some people in South Sudan, such as those from Old Fangak, are partially or completely cut off from humanitarian aid. Access to the town is difficult in normal times, but the detritus of the floods has blocked the airstrip, which was cleared from the bush, and boat access from the river.

Data from South Sudan suggests that more erratic and unpredictable weather patterns are now the norm.

The floods were caused by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), also known as the “Indian El Niño, a weather pattern discovered only in 1999. The strongest IOD to strike east Africa in 61 years happened in 2019. So when the rains arrived in 2020 in South Sudan, the water from the previous year had not yet receded, resulting in more devastating floods. This year’s rainfall could further worsen the situation, making the resultant hunger catastrophic.

“People will die of hunger. Everyone in Old Fangak is lacking food and lost what they cultivated. Hunger is the one that will kill people,” says Peter Kak, a fisherman and grandfather of five who lives on a grass island with his son Samuel. The two men stayed behind after sending the rest of the family to higher ground. Here, they fish every day.

“Flooding, conflict, Covid-19 and poverty make the situation here dire,” says Sulaiman Sesay, of Action Against Hunger, one of the few aid organisations active in this area of South Sudan. “The world needs to know that people are suffering in this way.”

The socioeconomic measures adopted in response to the pandemic have affected already critical hunger situations in vulnerable places such as South Sudan. A joint report by the World Food Programme and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that threatening global hunger levels seem to be reaching new highs.

In Old Fangak people grew sorghum, a cereal that is easy to cultivate. Now they can eat only water lilies and fish. But not everyone has fishing nets and for those who do the catches are rarely enough to satisfy the appetite.

“There’s not enough sorghum, so we have to resort to the water lily,” explains Samuel Gai. The flowers have to be collected in great numbers to grind and make a small amount of cereal.

Despite the severity of the floods, the people of Old Fangak refuse to give up. In the face of rising waters, hunger and isolation from the rest of the country, the community shows extraordinary resilience.

“We cooperate,” says Joseph Martin, a villager helping to repair the constantly collapsing airstrip dyke. “The women take the water out with buckets and we put the mud on the dykes to prevent water leaking in. They do their part and we do our part.

“When there is work, men and women work together and they cooperate. Some of the people come and work even without us asking them … this is how we do it, if there is work to save the town, we work together,.”

Moving water by the bucketload all day takes a huge toll on hungry people. “Because of this water, I’ve lost weight. We are doing this alone, all day and night throwing water over the dyke. Nobody comes to help us. We are all exhausted,” says Nyayen Chuol, who works on the dyke with her elderly mother.

Samuel Yong in the makeshift shelter he made on a grass mound to escape the rising water

Where dykes have already been breached many people move on to neighbours’ homes and start again, helping to keep other dykes strong.

“I’m worried all the time. At night I’m trying to stay awake with a fire so I can burn a bit of grass and go check if the dyke is leaking or about to break. Every night. I’m so worried I can’t even sleep thinking that if I fall asleep the dyke could break and I can drown,” says Nyayang Kich, who had to abandon her flooded home for the higher ground of her neighbour.

The water sitting stagnant is compromising health too, leading to a spike in malaria-carrying mosquitoes.

“The climate has changed from the years when I was young because we have never experienced floods like this before. What we are experiencing now is horrible. We are suffering from hunger and we didn’t before. The climate has changed. For old people it’s horrible. It’s hard moving in this water; we don’t know where to sleep or what to eat. We are in God’s hands,” says 83-year-old Mary Nyamat.","Fri, 19 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98594f91e045de1aa58e97ae674b51bf2afed6fa/0_650_8272_4963/master/8272.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=11e7d9fdab4148e3e033de26dd5f581e,"['south', 'hunger', 'villages', 'food', 'work', 'night', 'land', 'drowned', 'old', 'sudans', 'flooded', 'floods', 'sudan', 'water', 'fangak', 'stalks']", 
65,65,FL-2011-000132-UGA,KCCA names most risky roads during rainy season - Daily Monitor,https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/kcca-names-most-risky-roads-during-rainy-season-3337244,"By Franklin Draku More by this Author

In December 2019, five people were killed by floods in Kampala after a downpour.

The dead included a police officer, an army officer and three others.

Earlier on May 26, 2019, eight other people died in a similar manner.

The floods hit many parts of the capital, cut off roads and destroyed several property in Kampala and surrounding areas of Bwaise, Nateete, Nalukolongo, Bugolobi, Nakawa ,Industrial Area, and Kyambogo. About 500 households were affected.

Following these incidents, Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) carried out a risk assessment and identified the most dangerous or risky roads that are vulnerable to floods during rainy season.

Based on the findings of the assessment, on March 24, 2021, KCCA issued a warning to Kampala residents about the flood hotspots and warned road users and residents.

This comes shortly after the Uganda weather authorities forecast that the country will be seeing more heavy rain characterised by flooding, strong winds, and lightning.

“Due to the current heavy rain, the public is warned that there will be a number of inconveniences from flooding i.e. submerging some of our roads and collapse of our aged infrastructure. Further, our transport infrastructure will be directly or indirectly damaged during these weather conditions posing a threat to human safety and causing significant disruption,” a KCCA public notice states.

“This arises from an inefficient storm water drainage system that is intended to manage overland flow. Government is organising funding to implement the Kampala Drainage Master Plan, which is intended to solve this problem,” the notice added.

Damaged roads

Many city roads are in poor state with potholes and a big number have been washed away.

Last week, a drainage channel at Mukwano Road roundabout that was completed last month caved in. The public accused Uganda National Roads Authority, KCCA officials, and contractors of connivance to do shoddy work on the channel.

One Twitter user, Mr Keith Ahumuza, posted that such shoddy works points to the issue of bad governance that Uganda is grappling with.

“The events playing out in our country currently from debts, injustices, corruption scandals, substandard works, and judicial issues are fruits of the kind of system that has been sown. Africa’s problem is not its people but the governance systems. God has His way of embarrassing,” he tweeted.

Ms Sharon Keitesi, another Twitter user, drew parallels with Tanzania, noting that if such had happened there, heads would have rolled at KCCA.

“If this had happened in Tanzania under the late Magufuli leadership, all the KCCA engineering team would be in jail but since this is Uganda, that’s normal and it cannot make any of the concerned authorities panic,” she tweeted.

On their part, the city authorities said: “There were defects on the recently completed works by one of our contractors on a Nakivubo Channel section at Mukwano Roundabout on Sixth Street, Industrial Area. The contractor, who undertook the failed works, shall be required to remedy according to the contract.”

“We appeal to the public to take precautions while using public infrastructure during the rainy season as government puts in place mechanisms to improve it,” a KCCA statement read.

Hopeful

Kampala drainage master plan

The city authorities completed the new Kampala Drainage Master Plan in December 2017.

According to a report to Parliament, the master plan provides structural measures to improve the city drainage and non-structural measures such as improving solid waste management and promoting use of green/pervious compounds to absorb floods.

KCCA officials say the implementation will cost $208m (about Shs758.6 billion). It is not clear if the funding for the master plan has been secured.

66,66,FL-2011-000132-UGA,"Floods, storms and searing heat: 2020 in extreme weather - The Guardian",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/30/floods-storms-and-searing-heat-2020-in-extreme-weather,"This year has broken a series of unwelcome weather records. Last month was the warmest November in history. This followed the hottest January, May and September. All-time temperature peaks were registered from the Antarctic to the Arctic. Since the start of the year, Australia, Siberia and California have suffered record fires. The Atlantic has generated record storms. Ice in the Laptev Sea has started forming later than ever.

The coronavirus pandemic may have dominated the news and temporarily reduced emissions. But 2020 has also demonstrated the increasingly evident impact of human-driven global heating. The six hottest years in human history have all occurred since 2014. That sequence will certainly continue for a seventh year. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) will soon know whether 2020 will take first, second or third place in the all-time ranking.

Scientists are surprised temperatures have been so high in the absence of an El Niño, the phenomenon that boosts warmer years such as the current record, 2016. On the contrary, the latter half of this year there was the emergence of a cooling La Niña, which churned up chillier-than-normal waters in the equatorial Pacific. Petteri Taalas, the secretary-general of the WMO, said that without this influence, 2020 would certainly have been the warmest year ever measured.

In climate terms, the long-term trend is more important than individual records, but it is the latter that directly affects lives and livelihoods. Unusual heat, drought, fires or storms can be caused by natural variation, local factors or industrial emissions, but scientists are increasingly able to identify that extreme weather events are more frequent and intense as greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere.

“2020 has been another very hot year. We see very strongly the impact of what that means on the changing intensity and likelihood of extreme weather events,” said Friederike Otto, the associate director of the Environmental Change Institute at University of Oxford and co-lead of the World Weather Attribution initiative (WWA). “Every year of more emissions and increasing global mean temperature has an impact on people.”

Humankind’s fingerprint was particularly evident in the Siberian heatwave, which was made at least 600 times more probable by humans, and the Australian bushfires, which were made more than 30% more likely.

Here is how this year unfolded with global heating at 1.1C above pre-industrial levels. This toll may seem horrifying, but it is just a sample – and will be modest compared with a future world on course for more than 3C of warming.

JANUARY

1 January

Record floods in Indonesia kill at least 19 people, with 62,000 evacuated. The national meteorological agency reports the highest daily rainfall seen in Jakarta since records began in 1866: “This is not ordinary rain.”

4 January

Temperatures in the Sydney basin hit a new high of 48.9C, the latest in a series of records in Australia. Bushfires create a 620 miles (1,000km) wide, 21 miles high smoke cloud, three times bigger than anything seen in the world before. It spreads so far that black charcoal reaches Antarctica. Scientists describe it as “a new benchmark on the magnitude of stratospheric perturbations”.

6 February

Record mainland Antarctic heat. The Argentinian research base Esperanza on the northern tip of the Antarctic peninsula, measures a new high for the southern continent of 18.4C (65.3F).

9 February

Record Antarctic island heat. The 20.75C logged by Brazilian scientists at Seymour Island is almost a full degree higher than the previous record of 19.8C in 1982. This has still to be confirmed by the WMO.

MARCH

31 March

The Australian bushfire season comes to an end after more than six months of destruction – 33 fatalities, 3,000 homes burned, and more than 10m hectares (25m acres) razed. Wildlife deaths are estimated at more than 1bn mammals, birds and reptiles combined, and hundreds of billions of insects. From the beginning of September 2019 to 23 February 2020, bushfires have emitted 434m tonnes of carbon dioxide, equivalent to about three-quarters of the discharges of Australian industry. Studies by the WWA indicate the bushfires were made at least 30% more probable by human-driven climate change. The summer of 2019-2020 is the second-hottest ever, after the previous year’s summer.

APRIL

20 June

Record Arctic heat. The Russian town of Verkhoyansk registers 38C (more than 100F) amid a freakishly prolonged Siberian heatwave. Siberian wildfires cover almost 1m hectares and release 59m tonnes of carbon dioxide, surpassing last year’s record. On average, temperatures in this region of the Arctic have been 5C above average in the first six months of the year. Scientists from the WWA say this was made at least 600 times more probable by human emissions.

13 August

Two months of record rainfall in southern China kills 219 people, prompts the evacuation of 4 million, and causes $26bn in economic losses. The Three Gorges Dam inflow hits a record 72,000 cubic meters a second. The megacity of Chongqing is put on its highest flooding alert since 1981.

16 August

Hottest summer ever in the northern hemisphere. Death Valley records a temperature of 54.4C (129.9F), the third-highest on Earth since 1931 (and the two previous records are in question).

26 August

Record fires in California. More than 405,000 hectares burn in nine days – more than three times the average in the “normal” wildfire season. At least five people are killed, and more than 100,000 evacuated.

28 August

Record flooding in the Sahel region of Africa affects 500,000 people. The White and Blue Nile burst banks. The average level of the Blue Nile reaches 17.43 metres (57.19ft), the highest since Sudan started measuring in 1912. Senegal records 124mm of rain over a seven-hour downpour – the amount that would usually be expected across the entire rainy season from July to September. Sudan imposes a three-month state of emergency on 4 September, after rains destroys about 100,000 houses and kills more than 100 people. In Nigeria, flooding damages 500,000 hectares of farm produce, amounting to about 5bn naira (£9.8m), according to NKC African Economics.

12 September

1 December

Record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season ends. Thirty storms grew strong enough to earn a name, beating 2005’s record of 28 storms. The WMO ran out of storm names by September, turning to the Greek alphabet for labels for the first time since 2005.

4 December

The bushfire season starts early in Australia with devastating wildfires on Fraser Island as experts worry that the months ahead could be disastrous.

12 December

The World Meteorological Agency says 2020 is certain to be among the three hottest years ever recorded. Although global emissions are likely to have fallen by 7% this year, carbon concentrations in the atmosphere continue to rise. The UN reports global heating in on course to reach 3.2C by the end of the century because governments are not taking sufficient climate action to keep temperatures to the Paris Agreement target of 1.5C to 2C.

Almost one year on from the first reported case of Covid-19 in Wuhan, China, the worldwide death toll of the pandemic has passed 1.6 million people and is estimated to cause $28tn of losses. Scientists have warned such outbreaks will become more common as the world’s natural life support systems, including the climate, break down as a result of rising temperatures, deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade. The UN secretary general says humanity has been waging war on nature, and that making peace will be the defining task of the 21st century.","Wed, 30 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fb9db4f80d4a4b71ebd3db63097319d092c6f50/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=014552998e4de138981ddd3ae07f737e,"['searing', 'records', 'record', 'hectares', '2020', 'photograph', 'fires', 'million', 'storms', 'average', 'floods', 'extreme', 'world', 'hottest', 'heat', 'weather']",

KAMPALA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- At least two children were killed by floods following heavy rains in the western Ugandan district of Rubanda on Saturday, police said here Sunday.

Elly Maate, the Kigezi regional police spokesperson in a statement, said two female juveniles were swept away by running water at Karengyere village, Muko Sub County, amid a heavy down pour.

""Police in Muko received information that two female juveniles were yesterday (Saturday) swept by running water amid heavy down pour. Bodies were retrieved pending postmortem,"" said Maate.

Several parts of the east African country, especially western and eastern regions, are currently experiencing normal to above normal rainfall, with destructive effects, according to the weather department.

In its March-May seasonal rainfall outlook, the Uganda National Meteorological Authority warned of enhanced rainfall over several parts of the country that could result into disasters such as landslides and foods, leading to loss of lives and destruction of property in the first major rain season.

Continuous rains and inflows from rivers around the Rwenzori region are responsible for the rising water levels in Lake Albert and flooding of surrounding areas.



The floods have devastated several areas in Ntoroko district, where more than 70,000 people are living in camps in Kanara Sub-county, 1,300 homes are abandoned and uncountable properties destroyed.



Jaconius Musingwire, the Western Region Manager of the National Environment Management Authority -NEMA observes that heavy water inflows especially from rivers streaming out of the Rwenzori mountains have significantly increased the water volumes in Lake Albert.



The situation, he says, has been worsened by silt that has been carried down into the lake raising the water levels. Musingwire says there is a need for a multi-sectoral approach to deal with environmental degradation in the region which has left the earth clear of natural vegetation cover.



//Cue in; “That water no longer…

Meanwhile, Ntoroko district administration needs at least 4 billion Shillings to resettle flood victims displaced by the rising water levels. In an interaction with a URN, the flood victims appealed to the government to resettle them anticipating that the floods may not rescind soon.



Ben Muthahinga, the acting District Chairperson says the money will be used to construct temporary resettlement structures, pit latrines, installation of water tanks and boreholes.","Fri, 23 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://ugandaradionetwork.net/a/helpers/image.php?fileId=230894&m=0&w=960&h=960,"['rwenzori', 'uganda', 'albert', 'mountainsnema', 'subcounty', 'l', 'floods', 'levels', 'inflows', 'district', 'region', 'uncountable', 'fed', 'radionetwork', 'ntoroko', 'lake', 'victims', 'water', 'heavy']",

Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) has significantly dealt with the challenge of flooding in the City.

A year ago, Kampala was experiencing floods at certain black spots that made navigation at those points impossible to go past for several hours after a downpour.

These locations included; Clock Tower on Entebbe Road that often covered the Fire Brigade headquarters parking; Mulwana Road in Bugoloobi Parish; at the Electoral Commission head office on Jinja Road; and the Bwaise communities in Kawempe Division. The floods disrupted navigation in the city, damaged both business and household property as well as affecting livelihoods in vulnerable communities.

KCCA embarked on an aggressive drainage infrastructure development programme in line with the Kampala Drainage Master Plan (KDMP) and the Kampala Capital City Strategic Plan 2020/2021-2024/2025 whose strategic goal is that “by June 2025 Kampala will be an inclusive, liveable, resilient and well planned city that provides economic opportunities to all”. The strategic plan is anchored on four pillars; Economic growth, governance and citizen engagement, quality of life and city resilience.

Some of the projects done or in progress include the construction of the Lubigi and Nakamiro channels with a combined stretch of 5.88Km at Shs82.7B launched in August 2020 by President Museveni. The two channels will solve the flood water menace in the low lying areas of Bwaise, stretching into Kawala in Rubaga Division.

The Clock Tower area and Mulwana Road flooding has been significantly dealt with by downstream interventions on Nakivubo Channel in the Kanyogoga swamp catchment area in Makindye and Nakawa divisions.

Here KCCA is desilting and widening the channel by removing gravel and other sediments that affect the breadth, depth and flow of water. The box culvert constructed on Mulwana Road plus widening and constructing the open drain that feeds into Nakivubo channel is already proving that the area shall be floodless when works are completed. The drainage works under the Kampala Flyover Project are to further solve the stagnation challenge at Clock Tower.

Other drainage improvement works including construction of St Dennis Channel that flows through Kulekana and Nakinyuguzi Channel in Salaama Parish, both in Makindye Division. In Central Division, KCCA is working on Kitamanya’agamba drain (below the Law Development Centre) in Kagugube Parish. In Rubaga Division, Nabulagala Channel and the box culvert along Sentema Road have been constructed, hence mitigating the flooding incidences.

Also in Rubaga Division, interim interventions on sections of Nalukolongo Primary Channel are ahead of the planned reconstruction once funds are obtained for both the channel works and remaining compensation of persons.

One of the key challenges affecting the efficiency of drainage channels is garbage. There is a lot of irresponsible dumping of garbage (polythene, plastic bottles and trade refuse) that ends up blocking the drainage system once it is swept away by surface water run-off or when dumped in the channels causing surface runoff build up and stagnation (floods). Whereas KCCA has emergency teams at the drainage channels during the rain, we appeal to the public to responsibly manage waste.

Another challenge is the illegal developments and encroachments on drainage reserves of primary and secondary channels. Some developers have constructed over the drains while others have illegally diverted the course of drainage channels. Consequently, the capacity of these drains has decreased and maintenance affected resulting in flooding as seen in Bugolobi, Nalukolongo Kamwokya, and Kansanga areas.

The KDMP was developed to improve the old, dilapidated and inefficient existing drainage systems. It recommends both structural and non-structural measures.

Sorting out Kampala’s drainage challenges may not be a fortnight or season’s work but great strides have been taken for one to confidently note that the floods are no more in Kampala, save for the temporal stagnation that usually clears within 10 to 15 minutes after a heavy downpour.

71,71,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Heavy rains may mar quality of Ugandan coffee crop: official - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-coffee-idUSKBN2330PZ,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - The quality of Uganda’s coffee crop may decline in the coming months as heavy rains across the east African nation have reduced the amount of sunshine necessary for bean drying, an industry official told Reuters on Wednesday.

Uganda is Africa’s largest exporter of coffee followed by Ethiopia and grows mostly robusta variety.

The country has been pounded by unusually heavy rains that started in August resulting in deaths, displacement and extensive damage to roads and other infrastructure.

Western Uganda, including the foothills of the Rwenzori mountains that are among the biggest coffee growing areas, has received some of the most intense rains.

“The drying process is a major problem in most of the places...the weather is not good for drying,” David Muwonge, head of marketing at the National Union of Coffee Agribusiness and Farmer Enterprises (NUCAFE) told Reuters.

“There’s a higher risk of beans becoming mouldy unless farmers are well sensitised.”

Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA), the state-run regulator, forecasts Uganda’s bean exports will climb 16% to 5.1 million 60-kg (132-pound) bags in the current crop year ending September.

The country’s coffee output has surged in recent years, the fruition of a government programme that has been distributing free seedlings to farmers to expand acreage and replace aging trees.

Authorities say their target is to help boost annual production to 20 million bags by 2025.

The beans have traditionally been Uganda’s biggest commodity export but were recently overtaken by gold which now annually earns the country over $1 billion.

Muwonge said the damage to transport infrastructure by the rains and flooding was likely slow the flow of beans from farms and collection centres from some of the deep rural areas.","Tue, 26 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['drying', 'farmers', 'official', 'crop', 'quality', 'beans', 'million', 'coffee', 'damage', 'ugandan', 'rains', 'mar', 'ugandas', 'heavy', 'told']",

Three months after Kasese District was hit by floods that, among others, destroyed roads, schools and health centres, authorities are faced with humanitarian challenges.

More than 10,000 people were displaced by the floods and some primary schools, which include Bulembia and Kyanjuki, were submerged. Kilembe Hospital was also submerged while roads and bridges were damaged.

The May floods hit the district after five rivers burst their banks following days of torrential rains. Government then delivered some relief items to support the displaced persons and promised more interventions, which are yet to be fulfilled.

As a result, several people are living in camps where they are facing serious health, financial and sanitation challenges.

Daily Monitor at the weekend Kanyangeya, Nkaiga and Kiraro primary schools that are host to thousands of displaced families.

Kilembe Mines Hospital was immensely affected by the floods and was later relocated to Kasese Town where it is hosted by Kasese Catholic Diocese. This has denied residents of Kilembe the much needed health services. They now have to trek long distances in search of better health services.

Mr Deogratius Isemamba, the chairperson of Namuhuga Ward in Bulembia Division, Kasese Municipality, said close to 100 families are camped at Kanyangeya Primary School, which is congested while pregnant mothers struggle to access health facilities due to the impassable roads that were affected by the floods.","Thu, 06 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['health', 'primary', 'kanyangeya', 'submerged', 'grapples', 'kilembe', 'kasese', 'displaced', 'floods', 'uganda', 'issues', 'roads', 'sanitation', 'schools']",

Despite rain reducing in most parts of the country, many others continue to experience devastating effects of floods.

The raging floods have claimed about 20 lives and left thousands homeless. The worst hit are eastern, northern and western parts of the country.

In western region, Kasese District has experienced back-to-back floods after five major rivers burst their banks, sweeping away homes, schools, hospitals, and churches.

The recent episode was on May 21 when rivers Thaku and Lhubiriha burst their banks near the Uganda-DR Congo border, killing eight people.

The Kasese District environment officer, Mr Augustine Kooli, said the rainfall pattern in the area was the highest in April and May more than any other time of the year.

“The district experiences a bimodal rainfall pattern. The first rains are short but fall with high intensity and occur between March and May, and the longer rains from August to November have a low intensity,” he explained.

He added: “Annual rainfall ranges from 800mm to 1,600mm and is greatly influenced by altitude. At the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains, the rainfall amount is between 1,200mm and 1,400mm.” Mr Kooli explained that under the District Integrated Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan 2017-2020, they encouraged the communities to plant trees on mountain slopes to reduce the runoff.

Western region

In Isingiro District, five people died in Kabuyanda Town Council and Kabuyanda Sub-county on May 2 following heavy rain, according to Isingiro South MP Alex Byarugaba.

The rain also triggered landslides and floods in the hilly area characterised by deep valleys. “We have always experienced these catastrophes but this time the impact was far too great; I had never seen this extent of damage by rains,” Mr Byarugaba said on Monday.

The floods and landslides destroyed houses, banana plantations, vegetable gardens, fishponds, roads and bridges.

Mr Byarugaba added that more than 800 households of between 4,000 and 5,000 people were affected in Kikagati and Kabuyanda Town Council, while bridges in Kaburara, Rwabisheri, Kabumba, and Kamwotsya were destroyed. “These are crossing points within these sub-counties, connecting health centres, schools and markets. People now can’t easily access these places. Local leaders have mobilized people who just worked on temporary measures for crossing,” he remarks.

In Kanungu District, the area vice chairman, Mr Gad Byomuhangi, on Monday said most roads and bridges were destroyed by rain and yet they do not have money to work on them.

The Kisoro District chairperson, Mr Abel Bizimana, said Rubuguri-Katojo road was cut off after Rushaga Bridge was washed away by floods.

He added that Ruhezamyenda Bridge that connects Rubuguri-Kisoro Town road was also washed away and local people have resorted to using community paths to connect to either side.

In eastern Uganda, floods mostly hit Manafwa, Kween, Bududa, Sironko, Pallisa, Butaleja, and Bukedea districts.

In Pallisa, more than 30 families were displaced at the beginning of the month after floods swept away their homes and gardens.

In Kween District, landslides killed three people and displaced about 50 families in Chepsukunya Town Council and Ngenge Sub-county.

In Budaka District, hundreds are stranded with nowhere to sleep after a heavy storm hit several villages.

Northern region

In Lango Sub-region, more than 350 households in Apac District have been left homeless.

The affected are residents of Acholi Inn Landing Site, Kayei Landing Site, Wansolo Landing Site, and Kampala Kagoi, all in Akokoro Sub-county.

The flash floods also affected residents of Aganga, Tarogali and Alworoeng parishes in Ibuje Sub-county.

Overflowing water from Lake Kyoga and River Nile is currently invading dry land along the shorelines every day, submerging homes and gardens of crops.

The Apac Resident District Commissioner (RDC), Ms Beatrice Akello Akori, said a team from the district visited the affected areas last week to assess the damage and is compiling a report that will be sent to the Office of the Prime Minister. “We are looking at resettling them at Maruzi Ranch but these people are very tricky; once you give them land, they don’t want to leave it,” she said.

In Busoga Sub-region, increasing water levels on Lake Victoria have displaced about 4,000 residents at Masese Landing Site, Rippon and Gomba, all in Jinja Municipal Council.

The councillor representing Masese at Jinja Municipal Council, Mr Ronald Katongole, said there is a need to relocate all people at Masese Landing site. “We (local leaders) have tried to do what is necessary to ensure that people are safe but due to this pandemic, sometimes people turn violent that implementing some of the health directives is challenging,” he said.

Central region

In Masaka District, increasing water levels at landing sites on Lake Victoria shoreline have started extending to villages, sparking fear among residents.

By last week, the floods had swept through Makonzi Parish, Bukakata Sub-county, displacing 450 households across five villages of Kasaka, Bwami, Bukoko, Kisuku and Makonzi .

The floods first submerged the landing sites of Lambu, Kaziru, Kisuku, Malembo and Kachanga, forcing about 20,000 people to relocate to safer places on the mainland where they have since set up makeshift houses.

Although government has extended them some relief assistance such as food and tarpaulins, the victims are still in dire need of more humanitarian assistance.

Bukakkata Sub-county chairperson Aloysius Jjuko said no deaths have been recorded though residents are at high risk of contracting water -borne diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera and Hepatitis A due to the deteriorating sanitation situation in the area.

“Our focus has been on those displaced from landing sites but the problem has escalated, residents have lost houses and crops and government should assist them as well,” he said The Resident District Commissioner, Mr Herman Ssentongo, said area leaders have been tasked to identify free government land where victims can permanently be resettled. “This tragedy is unprecedented and as government we cannot leave our people to continue suffering; a lasting solution has to be found,” he said.

Kalangala cut off

In Kalangala, flash floods have also caused similar havoc, cutting off three landing sites and separating them from the main Bugala Island. The affected landing sites are Kaazi-Malanga, Mukalanga and Kasamba in Bujumba Sub-county.

Access to the three landing sites from Bugala Island has been by road but currently, residents have to use boats to connect to the area. Mr Federico Ssekatawa, the chairperson Kaazi- Malanga Village, said life on the ‘new island’ has become very difficult as residents lack food, clean water and medical supplies.

Currently, an estimated 7,500 residents in the area have no access to electricity supply after the devastating floods forced the service provider, Kalangala Infrastructure Services, to disconnect power lines to avoid electrocution.

Above-average 2020 second season cereal harvest expected in bi‑modal rainfall areas

In bi‑modal rainfall areas covering most of the country, harvesting of the 2020 second season crops is about to start and will be completed in January. The September‑November rainy season was characterized by abundant precipitations, especially in northern areas, favouring crop establishment and development. Vegetation conditions are good across the country (see ASI map) and an above-average crop production is expected. However, the torrential rains triggered flooding in September and October near Lake Albert and Lake Kyoga, in northwestern Amuru, Adjumani, Obongi, Packwach, Moyo, Lamwo and Arua districts and in eastern Butaleja and Mbale districts. In addition, landslides occurred in mountain areas of eastern Mbale, southern Kisoro and western Bunyangabo districts. Floods and landslides affected about 16 500 people and caused losses of lives, damage to infrastructure and localized crop losses. Subsequently, in late November, heavy rains caused floods in Mbarara District and landslides in Kasese District, both located in the South-Western Region, affecting more than 2 000 people.

The first season harvest concluded in July and production was estimated at above‑average levels due to abundant seasonal rains, despite localized but significant flood-related production shortfalls.

Total cereal production for 2020 is put at about 3.6 million tonnes, nearly 4 percent up from 2019 and similar to the average of the previous five years.

In February 2020, a desert locust outbreak affected northeastern Teso and Karamoja subregions and northern Acholi and Lango subregions. Damage to pastures and crops was localized as swarms were of relatively small size and the Government, with the support of FAO, carried out effective control operations. Although as of late November no swarms were present in the country, Cyclone Gati hit northern Somalia on 22 November 2020 bringing heavy rains and creating a conducive environment for the formation of several immature swarms in early December. Some of these swarms could reach northern Kenya by mid‑December. As a result, there is a concrete risk of another locust invasion of northeastern and northern areas of the country, characterized by an already fragile food security situation. The desert locust response plan is 90 percent funded through multiple donors and agencies, and contingency plans are in place for surveillance and control measures.

In the uni‑modal rainfall agro‑pastoral Karamoja Region, the April‑September rainy season had an early onset in March, with heavy rains triggering flooding and waterlogging which resulted in delayed and reduced plantings, also due to seed shortages. As a result, although the good performance of seasonal rains benefitted yields, cereals and pulses were harvested in October, with about a one‑month delay, and production is estimated at 10‑20 percent below average due to a reduced planted area and to the continuation of seasonal rains into October, which resulted in increased post-harvest losses.

Abundant seasonal rains benefitting pastoral livelihoods

In the agro‑pastoral areas of Cattle Corridor and Karamoja Region, abundant rains between September and November have resulted in above‑average rangeland conditions (see Vegetation Condition Index Map). Ample availability of water and pasture benefitted animal body conditions, with above‑average levels of meat and milk production. However, in Cattle Corridor significant losses of pasture due to floods have been reported in western Ntoroko and Bullisa districts and in central Nakasongola District. In Karamoja Region, the restrictive measures introduced to curb the spread of the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and the COVID‑19 pandemic, coupled with persisting insecurity related to cattle raids, have disrupted livestock movements and, animal and milk sales.

Prices of maize at low levels due to adequate availabilities and depressed demand

Prices of maize decreased by about 50 percent between May and August in all monitored markets, including the capital, Kampala, as the commercialization of the first season harvest increased market availabilities. The COVID‑19‑related restrictions exerted further downward pressure on prices, as demand by restaurants, hotels, schools and urban households was constrained by a lower economic activity and declines in incomes. Prices increased by about 15‑20 percent in September, as seasonal patterns were compounded by flood‑related trade disruptions, remaining subsequently mostly stable in October and November. Prices of maize in November were almost 40 percent below their year‑earlier levels.

In the cereal deficit Karamoja Region, the availability of low priced cereals from neighbouring surplus producing areas in Soroti, Lira and Acholi regions has resulted in a generalized decline of cereal prices, despite the below‑average local harvest. In several markets of the region, including Moroto, Kaabong and Napak, prices of sorghum in September were up to 20 percent below their year‑earlier levels.

Food security situation affected by measures adopted to contain spread of COVID‑19 pandemic

The restrictive measures introduced in March and April 2020 by the Government to curb the spread of the COVID‑19 pandemic had a substantial adverse impact on the food security situation. Despite the easing of restrictions in June/July, the economic and livelihood recovery has been slow.

According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, conducted in Karamoja Region, refugee settlements, host communities and urban areas, 2 million people (17 percent of the analyzed population) are estimated to be severely food insecure (IPC Phase 3: “Crisis” and Phase 4: “Emergency”) in the period September 2020-January 2021.

KEY MESSAGES

After an early onset, the March to May rainfall season peaked in late April and early May. Torrential rain caused floods in the Lake Victoria basin, major river basins, and low-lying flood-prone areas. At least 845,000 people were displaced across the Horn, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, according to data available from OCHA and country governments.

The rainfall season began to subside by mid-May, marking an earlier-than-normal end to the season in some short rains- and Gudependent areas of the Horn and an atypical dry spell in parts of Uganda. Dry and hot conditions are expected in bimodal areas of the Horn until the onset of the short rains/Deyr rains in late September/October.

Rangeland conditions remain exceptionally favorable in most bimodal areas. However, crop production prospects in eastern and southeastern Kenya, southern and northwestern Somalia, southwestern Ethiopia, parts of Uganda, and southeastern South Sudan are being closely monitored due to the mixed effects of heavy rainfall and floods, early end of season, and desert locusts.","Sat, 13 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1522366-EAST_AFRICA_Seasonal_Monitor_2020_06_07_final.png?itok=o2uM5OJJ,"['africa', 'seasonal', 'season', 'rainfall', '2020', 'areas', 'parts', 'east', 'horn', 'early', 'short', 'monitor', 'southeastern', 'rains', 'world', 'uganda', '12']",

SPRINGFIELD - Water continues to rise in some parts of Livingston Parish as Tropical Depression Beta brews in the Gulf.

The storm surge produced wind speeds up 30 mph, causing flooding along the immediate coasts of the Gulf, Lake Maurepas and Lake Pontchartrain. Livingston Parish officials say the water has risen a few feet in just 24 hours.

Along the Tickfaw River, you can find high water signs, roadways submerged in water, and businesses that were forced to close because of the flooding.

Cameron Ferachi, a resident in the Terry Harbor neighborhood, says it floods every time a storm comes their way.

""I need a boat to get to and from my truck,"" Ferachi said.

Ferachi's camp sits at the end of a flooded road. To avoid pushing water into homes or damage to his vehicle, he and his best friend Mike have come up with a solution. They kayak to and from their trucks, which are parked at the end of the street.

Paddling up and down the roads they usually travel down in a vehicle is not a situation they're excited to be in.

""When the water comes up, you get people out here sightseeing, pushing water in front of everybody. It really sucks,"" Ferachi said.

These conditions are so inconvenient for some locals, like Ferachi, that they plan to move away.

""I'm actually moving Oct. 13 to get away from the flooding. I can't deal with it anymore,"" Ferachi said from his kayak.

In the meantime, flash flood warnings and advisories remain active in the area through Wednesday, Sept. 23.

Livingston Parish officials say they will continue to monitor the area. If you are in need of sand or sandbags, supplies are available at your local fire department.

Residents of Ntoroko District have tasked all candidates seeking elective positions to address the issues of floods and drought that have persistently plagued the area.

The district experiences extreme floods during the wet season and drought during the dry season every year. Cattle keepers lose hundreds of cows to drought while during the rainy season, thousands are displaced.

Since May, floods have displaced about 10,000 people in the district as water from Lake Albert spilled into the communities about 10kms away. The most affected residents are from Kanara and Butungama sub-counties and Kanara Town Council.

Mr James Balinda, who now lives in Butungama Sub-county after he was displaced by floods from Kamuga Village in Kanara Sub-county, says over the years, their leaders, especially the MPs, have failed to address the challenge of floods.

""The leaders come here and make empty promises. Years have passed yet we have not seen any leader in his or her manifesto talking about issues of drought and floods on how they can be addressed,"" Mr Balinda says.

He adds due to the current floods, residents have lost their livelihoods and there is no plan by the government to help them get back to their feet.

The current floods have damaged roads, schools, and health facilities, among others, but residents say the government must look for solutions to see that people access social services.

Residents puzzled

Ms Agnes Muhindo, another flood victim, says: ""We have been told that the current floods will take more than three years for our area to normalise and our concern is where we shall be staying during this period?""

She suggests that government should consider relocating all the displaced people to safer areas to avoid losing their lives. Mr Abraham Asiiimwe, a cattle keeper from Rwebisengo Town Council, says government has in the past promised to construct valley dams in the area to tap excess water to be used during the dry season by cattle keepers but this has never happened.

The area MP, Mr Gerald Rwemurikya Ibanda, says he has been in talks with the central government through the Prime Minister's office, which has promised to relocate the displaced flood victims on 30 acres of land that is part of Tooro-Semuliki game reserve.

Umoja, Kachwakumu and Rwangara primary schools and Rwangara Health Centre III are submerged in water.

The candidates in the submerged schools were shifted to others in the nearest sub-counties not affected by floods.

Crux of the matter

According to Mr Gideon Masereka, a geographer, the northern part of Ntoroko has an escarpment (a long steep slope) that starts from Kichwamba side in Kabarole District up to Bundibugyo and the lower land up to Lake Albert.

Mr Masereka explains that during the wet season, rivers in the Mount Rwenzori range, which Ntoroko is close to, are always in the youthful stage when it rains.

They keep rising and flowing with a lot of water. By the time they reach the low lands of Ntoroko, they are in an old stage that ends up causing floods.","Tue, 10 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['campaigns', 'candidates', 'ntoroko', 'water', 'schools', 'season', 'fix', 'drought', 'land', 'district', 'voters', 'displaced', 'floods', 'uganda', 'start', 'task', 'mr']",

Leaders in Kikuube and Hoima districts are demanding the government to allocate part of Kabwoya Kaiso-Tonya Community Wildlife conservation area to resettle thousands of flood victims.



Kabwoya Kaiso-Tonya Community wildlife conservation area is situated in Kabwoya and Buseruka sub-counties in Hoima and Kikuube districts.



Over 20,000 people have been displaced by floods in the two districts of Hoima and Kikuube since March.



The most affected landing sites in Hoima are Tonya, Kijangi, Kaiso, Rwentali, Hoimo, Fofo, Mbegu, Waaki and Kiryamboga among others, while the affected areas in Kikuube include Nkondo, Sebigoro, Ususa, Senjojo, Wangjok, Busiki and Nsonga.



The flood victims have sought refuge in churches and schools while others are sleeping out in coldness under trees as the floods continue to ravage the area. Area leaders and the affected persons say the only option is to resettle them to the game reserve.



Peter Kyasimire a resident of Nkondo landing site in Kabwoya Sub County in Kikuube district says the government should consider the lives of the people and have them resettled.



//Cue in;”Abataka ba Nkondo…

Joyce Akumu who was displaced by floods at Kaiso landing site says currently she is settling at Kaiso Primary School with her five children since she has nowhere to construct another house because her house was completely submerged by floods.



Rashid Sunday, a resident of Sebigoro landing site says he was hit hard by the floods that submerged his house and currently he has nowhere to go.



He wants the government to come to their rescue and allocate part of the Kabwoya-Kaiso-Tonya community wildlife conservation area to resettle them.

The recent rains remind me of how poor our drainage system is. All you have to do is look at the roads every time it rains to know there is something fundamentally wrong with our infrastructure. And the most ridiculous thing about all this is that it has been happening since time immemorial. It is as if we are supposed to learn to live with the floods and normalise them. I have never travelled to other countries so I don’t know whether it is the same case elsewhere.

Do rain floods paralyse movement from one place to another in other countries too or is it just us? Do people have to be carried from one side of the road to another, do cars “drown” in mini rivers? And for those countries that have managed to solve this problem, how did they do it? Can we learn from them? What role can we all play in trying to create a clean and flood-free country?

I know for sure that if we followed a well-organised garbage dumping system, we would not have to deal with the consequences of a clogged drainage system. I also know that if we stopped settling in water catchment areas, we wouldn’t mess up the eco-system and the water would follow a natural drainage flow. What I don’t know is why we don’t do these things and yet continue to cry foul.

Every so often we wake up to huge factories built in what we all know to be swampy areas and yet we say nothing.

I wonder who we think will speak up for us. We have abused our environment way too much to expect any favours from nature.

There’s a song by the Swedish pop group, Ace of Bace titled, Everytime it rains. The chorus of that song says, “Cause every time it rains, I fall to pieces. So many memories the rain releases, I feel you, I taste you. I cannot forget. Every time it rains, I get wet”.

Well, here is a Ugandan rendition of those lines. “Every time it rains, Uganda falls to pieces. So much sewage and dirt and all manner of garbage the rain releases. We smell it, we are even doused in it, every time it rains.

Seriously though, we must do something about our drainage system and put an end to this man-made mess.

• Torrential rains are being experienced across Uganda. According to the Uganda National Meteorological Department (UNMA), abovenormal rains will continue until the end of the year.

• At least 38 people have died due to floods and landslides in Bundibugyo, Bududa and Sironko districts, and over 150 people have been injured. At least 300,000 have been affected and an estimated 65,000 people are displaced, according to Government sources.

• The floods and landslides have left a trail of destruction, including damaged homes, infrastructure, agriculture and livelihoods.

• The Government of Uganda, with the support of humanitarian partners, is responding to the most urgent needs of people affected.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

Due to heavier than normal rains since September—enhanced by the positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)—several districts in Uganda have been experiencing flash floods (mostly in urban areas) and landslides (in rural/hilly areas).

According to preliminary estimates from a rapid assessment conducted by the Office of the Prime Minister in the most affected sub-regions of Mount Elgon and South Western Uganda in early December, at least 300,000 people have been affected, including 65,000 people reportedly displaced by the impact of heavy rains since September 2019. Over 21,500 hectares of crop and plantations are reportedly damaged in these areas. As of 17 December, 38 people have reportedly lost their lives, including in the mountainous Bundibugyo district in the western region and the Mount Elgon area in eastern Uganda. Water systems in Bundibugyo have been destroyed, exacerbating the risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases. In the week of 16 December, three suspected cholera cases were reported in Bundibugyo district. However, they tested negative and there have been no confirmed cholera cases since November 2019, according to the Ministry of Health and WHO.

In the eastern lowland sub-regions of Teso and Bukedea sub-regions, thousands of people have been affected and hectares of crops destroyed. Damage to infrastructure, including roads and bridges, has been reported in the hilly south-western parts of Kigezi and Ruwenzori, the low-lying district of Ntoroko, the central sub-region of Buganda, western sub-regions of Ankole and Bunyoro, and northern sub-regions of Acholi, and Karamoja regions. This has hampered access to affected communities. Districts along the banks of the River Nile in West Nile sub-region have also suffered losses of crops and destroyed and damaged homes due to flooding.","Thu, 19 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1429368-ROSEA_20191219_Uganda_Floods_FlashUpdate%231.png?itok=t_WNKUX8,"['landslides', 'reportedly', 'western', 'flash', 'subregions', '2019', 'update', 'affected', 'rains', 'floods', 'uganda', 'including', 'bundibugyo', '19']",

The East African Community (EAC) Council of Ministers suggests Uganda may have breached the agreements on how much water to release from Nalubaale dam — the main outlet of the world’s largest freshwater lake.

Lake Victoria flows into River Nile, with the dam being one of the two major outlets.

Documents filed at the EAC Council of Ministers say Uganda has refused to execute a new policy governing the release of water in Jinja, a decision that has led to flooding of the lake that could claim more lives and cause destruction.

The council ordered EAC member states to implement the policy in 2012, but over four years, despite protests by Uganda.

Kenya, Tanzania and Burundi voted for its implementation at a Council of Ministers meeting that year.

Uganda insists that the policy, which determines volumes of water to be released based on Lake Victoria levels, cannot be implemented as it does not take into consideration several factors, like extraction in the affected countries.

Life and death

The policy is yet to be implemented. “The 26th EAC Council of Ministers directive on the policy has taken more than four years to implement, not only by Uganda, but also by the partner state,” Uganda says in its appeal to the council.

“Studies that had been directed to be completed by November 2014 have never started. Uganda is, therefore, of the view that the policy cannot be implemented and needs review.”

Nalubaale dam was built as part of a hydropower station in Jinja after Uganda and Egypt signed agreements that the East African country would not do anything to interfere with the flow of the Nile, the world’s longest river.

However, power station operators have, over the years, increased or reduced the volumes of water flowing from the lake based on how much is needed to meet the East African country’s electricity demand.

The release of too much water means Lake Victoria’s depth will decrease, a situation blamed on drought for many years.

Releasing less water means the level of the lake increases and could lead to floods in towns and villages surrounding it.

Floods killed at least six people and displaced 32,000 in Kisumu County and its environs in April and May. Ugandan authorities want the original natural flow out of the lake maintained.

The regional bloc ordered implementation of the schedule after it emerged that Uganda had been violating agreements to maintain the natural Lake Victoria outflow volumes before Nalubaale dam was built.

Mitigation measures

Uganda says the studies that led to the policy failed to consider major water extractions in the three countries.

It adds that the EAC Council of Ministers ordered the implementation of the policy before more data and information on water extraction in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania had been collected, yet that was recommended by experts whose reports were used in formulating it.

“The developed and adopted blueprint is therefore only a release policy and not a release and abstraction one,” Uganda says in its appeal.

“Potential impacts of the policy in Lake Victoria Basin countries as well as downstream states was not carried out to provide mitigation measures for a win-win situation as directed by the Council of Ministers.”

“Uganda has more than 600 kilometres of River Nile across her territory that includes lakes Kyoga and Albert. It has made significant developments based on the agreed curve policy that came into existence in 1954, which will be affected by the new water release and abstraction policy.”

The construction of Nalubaale hydroelectric power station in 1954 provided a reliable source of electricity for Uganda, but the decision has come to haunt hundreds of thousands of families living around the lake.

Before the construction of Nalubaale, the Owen and Ripon waterfalls were the main links between Lake Victoria and the Nile.

The waterfalls also acted as a natural tap, controlling the Nile and Lake Victoria outflows. After signing the agreements with Egypt, Uganda built Owen Falls dam, later renamed Nalubaale.

Preparations for building the giant dam and power station meant that Ripon Falls was to be excavated.

Moderating factor

Eventually, Nalubaale was submerged but Ripon Falls remained.

But as Uganda celebrated its increased electricity supply capacity, it was the beginning of problems for millions of people around areas touched by the lake in the three countries.

Since the commissioning of Nalubaale in 1959, its operators have either increased or reduced Lake Victoria outflows, depending on volumes required for the production of electricity.

When more water is needed to meet growing power demands, operators allow more water to flow out of Victoria, which in turn leads to lower levels in the lake.

Whenever rain falls heavily, Nalubaale has sufficient water. It means less water is released, increasing levels in Lake Victoria in turn.

To increase power production and utilise excess water spills from Nalubaale, Uganda built another dam called Kiira just a kilometre away. President Yoweri Museveni commissioned it in 2003.

In 2005, World Bank senior disaster risk management specialist Daniel Kull led a study that showed that Uganda released more than 50 per cent of the allowed water volumes from Nalubaale and Kiira dams over the previous two years.

Fish population

Mr Kull’s team also found that the drastic fall in Lake Victoria water levels at the time was more as a result of the releases in Jinja than drought as had been widely believed.

“Based on the results of this analysis, it must be concluded that the severe Lake Victoria drops occurring in 2004 and 2005 were about 45 per cent due to drought and 55 per cent due to over-releases from Nalubaale and Kiira dams,” the World Bank disaster risk specialist’s report said.

It added that the rains that followed could not raise the levels of the lake, which was partial evidence that water release had more impact that drought.

Nalubaale dam is operated by Eskom Uganda Ltd — a subsidiary of South Africa’s state-owned Eskom Holdings Ltd.

Eskom has been spilling large volumes of water from Nalubaale and Kiira dams between February and May. The water reached its peak limits after the heavier-than-normal rainfall, leading to floods.

The effects of water releases go beyond flooding. When the water level in the lake drops, it affects the fish population.

As marine creatures move inwards to deeper waters, fishermen follow them. They at times get arrested after ending up in Uganda or Tanzania.

At least 70 Kenyan fishermen were arrested after crossing into Uganda between May and October last year.

They were released after paying heavy fines. Others had their boats confiscated. Some complained of being tortured and beaten by Ugandan security officials.","Fri, 22 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.monitor.co.ug/resource/blob/1891214/b3b31c7a34adabef0a3b28da04b1f481/latest07pix-data.jpg,"['lake', 'policy', 'releasing', 'dam', 'council', 'lvictoria', 'floods', 'uganda', 'water', 'release', 'volumes', 'ugandas', 'nalubaale', 'victoria', 'blamed']",

The continuous rising water level in Lake Kwania has forced thousands of people in Dokolo district from their homes. The water has submerged several homes and gardens over the past three months forcing residents to take shelter in schools, churches and community facilities.



More than 5000 households have been affected in different Sub Counties in Dokolo District. Agwata, Adok, Adeknino and Kwera sub counties are the most affected where the water levels seem to be increasing each day. At least 166 households have been displaced in Agwata Sub County.



The affected families have temporarily moved in with their relatives or friends while others are renting in areas that are not affected by the flooding. At least 20 households have taken shelter at Kachung Junior, a private Primary school.



However, their biggest challenge is lack of clean drinking water. The families are currently depending on the flood water for drinking and domestic chores since the only borehole at the school has been dysfunctional for the past five months. They are also forced to share classrooms and open dormitories.



John Obel, a resident of Kachung Western Ward, says the area is flooded to the point that all their feet is rotting. He says their need small canoes to navigate the area.

Musa Ecweru, minister of state for relief and disaster preparedness, told Xinhua by telephone that torrential rains which started last month, marking the first major rainfall season in the country, have displaced people, destroyed homes, farms, washed away roads and other infrastructure.

He said most of the affected areas include the mountainous and hilly areas in eastern and western Uganda, low lying and plain areas in eastern region.

“This problem is across the whole country. Now there are thousands of people who are displaced. The officers in my office are compiling the figures (numbers of people) and extent of damage for each district across Uganda,” said Ecweru.

“We are going to sit down and see how to handle the magnitude of the problem. We shall see how to dispatch some support to the affected persons,” he said.

The Office of the Prime Minister has been running alert messages, warning that the country will face floods, landslides, strong winds and lightning as the first rain season peaks.

“We have been running alert messages on televisions and radios. These alerts started running about five months ago. We have been telling and warning the country of heavy rains and its dangerous effects,” said Ecweru.

He said landslides have hit the hilly western district of Kabale.

Ecweru said people living in mountainous areas, flood prone areas as well as wetlands should immediately vacate to safe places as heavy rains continue.

At least two children were killed by floods following heavy rains in the western district of Rubanda on Saturday, according to police.

According to the weather department, several parts of the country especially western and eastern regions, are currently experiencing normal to above normal rainfall, with destructive effects.

More than 150 families in Dei A Village, Panyimur Sub-county in Pakwach District are homeless after their houses were submerged following the rising water levels of Lake Albert.

Mr Nicholas Opar, the village chairperson, said the floods destroyed several houses and washed away crops.

The most affected communities are mainly fishermen from Singla Market, Kayonga and Wangkado in Panyimur Sub-county.

Mr Opar said most of the affected families were temporarily hosted by their relatives while others have sought refuge in nearby government primary schools.

“We are living in fear and anticipate a possible cholera and typhoid outbreak among others that may affect the community who live near the Nile and have occasionally been using the lake as their water source for domestic purposes,” he said.

Mr Shaban Ofoy, the sub-county chairperson, said the situation could create a food crisis in the area.

“We anticipate hunger because huge acres of gardens with crops were washed away,” Mr Kinobe said. He said they had previously warned the communities against settling in the wetlands but they have been hesitant to adhere to the directives because they had no place to relocate to.

Mr Robert Omito, the district chairperson, appealed to government and well-wishers for relief.

“We have notified the [Ministry] of Relief, Disaster and Preparedness, and Uganda Red Cross regional office to assess the level of devastation and come to our rescue urgently and attend to the village,” Mr Omito said.

He added that said since most of the affected families mainly rely on fishing as source of their livelihood, there is urgent need of relief supplies such as food, tents and blankets to temporarily settle the affected families.

Recurrent

In December last year, floods cut off Pakwach-Karuma road, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded. The Uganda National Meteorology Authority, in its “seasonal rainfall outlook for March to May 2020,” warned that there would be an overall increased likelihood of near normal to above normal (wetter than average) rainfall in several parts of the country. Floods have also ravaged other districts, including Kasese, Ntoroko, Bundibugyo, Kabale, Ntungamo and Isingiro.

93,93,FL-2011-000132-UGA,Vanessa Nakate: 'Many people are not yet aware of the dangers of climate change' - DW (English),https://www.dw.com/en/fridays-for-future-uganda-climate-change-africa-activism-food-security-water/a-54732304,"From Uganda and in her early 20s, Vanessa Nakate started protesting against climate inaction outside the Ugandan government gates in 2019. She's on a mission to raise awareness about the issue within Africa and internationally because she has seen the impacts of climate change already on her own community.

DW: When you started Fridays for Future activism in Uganda, you were very much alone right at the beginning. At what point did you think, 'OK, I should continue this or I'm going to give up'?

Vanessa Nakate: I just felt like I had to continue striking, especially because I was still doing it by myself. But then as time went on, more and more people started to get involved in different parts of the country doing the climate strikes. And also in the entire African continent, more activists started coming up and doing the climate strikes and demanding action. And to me, that is enough of a motivation to keep me doing activism, knowing that I am not doing it alone, and that there are millions of young people from different parts of the world striking and demanding climate action.

How does climate activism in your country differ from what it looks like in Europe? We're used to seeing big Fridays For Future strikes here, but what does it look like in Uganda?

Well, of course there is a big difference between the activism in Uganda and in Europe. This is mainly because of two things.

One is awareness. Many people are not yet aware of the dangers. They don't have the facts. They don't have the clear science about what is happening when it comes to the climate crisis.

And then the other thing is freedom of expression. Freedom of expression is not the same as we see it is in Europe and it's also harder for students here to walk out of school and do the climate strikes.

If I want to do climate strikes with students, I have to go in the schools because many of them, they have a fear of walking out of school. Just walking out would subject you to either suspension or expulsion.

Also getting permits for marches every Friday is very hard, especially if you don't have a strong organization that is behind you, that is supporting you. So activism in my country — or probably in any other African country — is different because of such restrictions.

With that in mind, how do you get people motivated to go on strikes?

By sharing on social media. That is — mainly on Twitter and Facebook — I would share my strikes every Friday and many people would ask questions about what I was doing and why I was doing that.

The other way is going into schools and requesting principals, director of schools to talk to students on Friday so that I get to discuss with them the challenges that our planet faces and their role in securing a better future.

One other way, we've been doing community reach-outs where we go to local communities and do cleanups, because most of these people, they don't have access maybe to a television. They don't watch the news. They don't know the challenges that the world is facing. So through these local reach-outs or doing cleanups, we get to speak to them, we get to explain to them how they can protect the planet, what they can do for our home, because all of us have a responsibility to play.

The Global Strike 4 Climate in Uganda's capital Kampala in 2019

Climate change is obviously a difficult thing to explain to anybody in the world. But for you, what are the main issues locally that you are dealing with?

I have clearly seen the danger that climate change places on people's lives and the danger is mainly an issue of food scarcity and water scarcity for people.

A large percentage of the people in Uganda are heavily dependent on agriculture as a source of survival, and that is mainly the people in the rural communities. It also affects those in the urban centers because they get food from the rural communities. It also brings about other problems of seeing more street children on the streets of Kampala. This is because many of them, they're trying to run away from their lands. They're trying to find a better way of survival.

Also, availability of access to clean water for the people, because when it floods, that means the water will still be contaminated. It's submerged even toilets, not just the farms, it also submerged drainage. That means any water source that the community was relying on was also contaminated by the dirt from the toilets. So you find that, even in the flood there is a water scarcity.

You, as well as I guess your colleagues one could call them from Europe, have a whole set of different agendas regarding what issues are important within Europe, as opposed to what is important across Africa or Asia. Has it ever been difficult working with them?

No. I believe in a way, yes, the demands are different, the urgency is different — when it comes to Europe, it isn't as urgent as it is in Africa with the climate crisis. So in Europe, you find that most of the activists, they are mainly targeting the politicians and the leaders in making decisions that will ensure that different parts of the world are protected, that will ensure that the Earth is protected.

I personally may not have reach to the leaders who determine the existence of the fossil fuel industry, who determine whether we are going to transition to a more sustainable future. Most of those leaders, they have so much influence as well in some of the countries on the African continent. So I feel like if they're able to reach out to those leaders in the European Parliament and put pressure on them to take the decisions that would save our planet, that also helps me out, that also helps the people of my country.

As you point out, places across Africa, whether it's the Sahel, whether it's the coastal areas, they have much more to lose than what we see in Europe. But for you, how does this make you feel when you can see that Africans are actually in a more dangerous position than the Europeans are, but that Africans have so little influence on that?

As a climate activist, of course, I understand that we have tried so much to ask for representation of every activist on the world stage, in discussions. But it is one thing to see that representation, but it's another thing for that representation to carry the same weight.

The weight of influence — it is not the same. The question is: Will they listen to what I will say? Will they find it important if I say it? What if I say the same thing today and no one pays attention to it and another activist from Europe says the same thing and it's given much attention?

What's your message to people across Africa about climate? No pressure.

For the people of Africa, no one is going to fight for you when it comes to the climate crisis.

If Africa experiences issues with the climate crisis, many times, we first look out for international media to talk about it. But now we need African media.

We can only save our continent if we work together. And unfortunately, it's not something that we are seeing right now.

Recently, you've actually been tweeting in German to try and get the message across. What made you do this?

Well, I did that because I was really angry and disturbed by the fact that Germany chose to push coal to 2038. I feel like that helps them and that doesn't help communities that are already being affected by the climate crisis. I feel like 2038 is too late. It's unnecessary and very dangerous for communities that are already facing devastating impacts of climate change.

So tweeting in German was a message to Germany, to the entire world. It was a message saying: 'I am watching you, as an activist. We are watching you and the decisions that you are making, they are not good for us. They are not good for our future. You have to reconsider and understand that we have no time left.'

The year 2020 will, without a shadow of a doubt, be etched into the collective memory of human society for a long, long time. It began with the novel coronavirus emerging out of China’s Wuhan and reaching all corners of Earth. It's only now, with the year coming to an end, that the world has begun its retort against COVID-19 through vaccination drives.

While a majority of the global population remained indoors all year to escape the clutches of the pandemic, natural disasters were out in full force, confronting many parts of the world with a catastrophic double whammy.

Here are five such major natural calamities from across the world in the bleak year that was 2020:

Locust Attacks in East Africa and Asia

Swarms of locusts invade Jaipur, Rajasthan on May 26, 2020. (Bhagirath/BCCL Jaipur)

The 2020 locust outbreak was the worst Kenya has seen in 70 years, and the worst in 25 years for countries like Ethiopia, Somalia, and India. It began in May 2018, when Cyclone Mekunu produced heavy rains over a vast, unpopulated desert in the southern Arabian Peninsula, thereby allowing locusts to breed there undetected. Thereafter, Cyclone Luban in October 2018 exacerbated the locust breeding, enabling three generations of locusts to mass-reproduce over a nine-month period. This led to an 8,000-fold increase in the locust population across the Arabian desert.

These mega-swarms then began migrating as per the wind direction, and by April 2020, the aerial armies had successfully invaded 23 countries—African nations like Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Uganda; Arabian countries like Yemen, Saudi Arabia; Paraguay and Argentina in South America; and South Asian nations such as Iran, Pakistan, and India.

The outbreak in India began in late 2019 and January 2020, with kilometre-wide swarms disrupting lives across ten states—Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Haryana, and Uttarakhand.

Subsequently, the Rajasthan government reported crop damage of 33%, while less than 33% crop damage was reported by the governments of Haryana (6520-hectare area), Madhya Pradesh (4400 ha), Maharashtra (806 ha), Uttar Pradesh (488 ha), and Uttarakhand (267 ha).

Bushfires in Australia

Bushfires in Australia tend to be a regular and widespread occurrence. However, the fires witnessed on the continent last summer—towards the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020—were unusually intense and far more destructive, earning this bushfire season the name ‘Black Summer’. While both natural and manmade causes started these fires, factors like high temperatures, drought conditions, high fuel load (accumulation of fallen bark, leaf litter, small branches), and global warming combined to enhance this disaster.

These raging bushfires led to tremendous destruction across the eastern half of the country, burning an estimated 18.6 million hectares of forests, destroying over 5,900 buildings, and directly killing at least 34 people. A further 445 fatalities were caused due to smoke inhalation, and 65,000 people were displaced, as this disaster affected nearly 80 per cent of Australians one way or another.

The fires also reportedly killed or affected at least 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs, also pushing some threatened species such as the long-footed potoroo, the marsupial, and the Kangaroo Island glossy black cockatoo closer to extinction! These ecological consequences aside, the bushfires also caused tremendous air pollution and carbon emission.

Overall, economists estimate the 2020 bushfires may have cost over 103 billion Australian Dollars in property damage and economic losses, thereby making them Australia's costliest natural disaster to date.

Cyclone Amphan

The year 2020 was another active year in terms of cyclones in the North Indian Ocean, with nine depressions forming in the region and five of them intensifying into cyclonic storms and more. Together, these systems caused damage worth $15.78 billion (one lakh fifty-seven thousand crore rupees), and killed about 269 people.

Advertisement Among these, Amphan—the first super cyclonic storm to have formed in the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 Odisha cyclone—was one of the strongest cyclones to hit India, while also being the costliest cyclone ever recorded in the North Indian Ocean in terms of damage caused.

On May 18, Amphan hit its peak intensity with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 260 km/h (160 mph), and two days later, made landfall over West Bengal. It caused great damage across coastal West Bengal, Odisha, Northeast India, and Bangladesh claiming 128 lives and causing overall destruction worth $13.7 billion (one lakh thirty-seven thousand crore rupees).

A few months later, Cyclone Nivar became the second-most destructive cyclone to hit India in 2020, as it made landfall over Tamil Nadu in late November and caused damage worth $600 million (four thousand crore rupees), killing 14. Other cyclones, namely Nisarga, Gati and Burevi, did cause significant local impacts. But, fortunately, the damages were not as high as Amphan and Nivar.

China Floods

Southern China, particularly the Yangtze basin and its tributaries, was affected by severe floods this year, as heavy rains wreaked havoc across the region during the rainy season between June-September. This disaster also extended to central and eastern China during July, effectively creating the worst flood situation the region has experienced since at least 1998. A total of 443 rivers were flooded nationwide, with 33 of them swelling to the highest levels ever recorded!

As per the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), a spike in rainfall activity—caused by climate change-induced rise in vapours emergence from the Indian and Pacific oceans—led to the flooding. Furthermore, anthropogenic factors like the reclamation of lakes and wetlands, urban development, and mass-disappearance of lakes also helped escalate the events.

By August, the floods had killed at least 219 people across the country, affected about 63.46 million people, and damaged 54,000 houses, 76 key national cultural relics, and 187 provincial cultural heritage sites. Overall, the disaster caused a direct economic loss of 178.96 billion CNY.

The destruction in China aside, the release of water from these swollen rivers may also have contributed to the flooding that occurred in adjoining India’s northeastern state of Assam during this period.

Monsoon floods are a common occurrence for northeast India. But, the year 2020’s Indian monsoon season was particularly difficult for Assam, as the state remained constantly flooded due to persistent spells of heavy rainfall and above-average seasonal precipitation in the region.

The initial flooding began with heavy showers in May, and it wasn’t until October that the statewide situation began to improve. By then, however, the floods had already affected over 50 lakh residents across 30 districts and 5,474 villages, killed 123 and forced over 1.5 lakh people to seek refuge in 627 relief camps and 1662 relief distribution centres set-up by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA). The floods also induced landslides, which further claimed 26 more lives.

Floods also exacerbated the spread of novel coronavirus in Assam, with the state recording over 2 lakh confirmed COVID-19 cases in this period. Stagnant waters and lack of access to clean water, hygiene supplies are also believed to have caused a spike in dengue, malaria, and Japanese encephalitis cases.

The inundation and subsequent landslides damaged bridges, government buildings, roads, embankments, and schools while putting at least 2.67 lakh hectares of crops to ruin. The flooding also affected the wildlife within the state, with more than 45,000 domesticated animals forced to flee or be abandoned, more than 150 wild animals rescued from the Kaziranga National Park, and 125 animals in the park, including 12 rhinoceros, succumbing to the floodwaters.

Seventeen people are confirmed dead in the south western region of the country, and a child is still missing.

Speaking to RFI Emmanuel Okecho, a Disaster Protect Officer with Uganda's Office of the Prime Minister explained “the south-west in flood prone because of naturally low-lying areas and marshes.”

Bridges and roads have been submerged by the heaviest rainfall to hit Uganda in over 25 years, complicating relief and rescue efforts.

“The floods have caused millions of shillings worth of damage,” Monica Azuba, Uganda’s Transport Minister, told RFI by telephone from Kampala adding, “the government is prioritising the humanitarian situation before assessing the full extent of infrastructural damage.”

The government dispatched an assessment team on Monday, and the Red Cross are leading search and rescue efforts in the east and south west of the country.

Scores of people are unaccounted for after mudslides engulfed homes killing at least eight people in the foothills of Mount Elgon over the weekend. This, despite concerted efforts by the government and environmental organisations to combat deforestation.

East Africa has been hit by torrential rains in recent weeks unleashing deadly flooding in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania and now Uganda. Two million people have been affected.

“These floods are worse than in 2010 because it has been raining almost constantly for two months,” says Okecho.

The rains are expected to continue at least until the end of December.

December 09, 2019 09:45 AM

KAMPALA - Ugandan authorities say the death toll from a week of floods and mudslides has risen to 36 people and left thousands stranded after heavy rains swept across a mountainous region.

A week of heavy rains caused floods and mudslides in Eastern Uganda’s Bugisu and Bundibugyo regions near Rwenzori Mountain.

Authorities say the flooding has taken a toll with the loss of life and property, and with thousands more left stranded.

The Ugandan Red Cross’s Irene Nakasita says search and rescue operations in the regions are hampered as most roads have been washed away.

“And the decision has been taken to put up a transit shelter until the situation normalizes. So, most likely Bubukwang transit center is going to house close to 700 people who are displaced in Bundibugyo,” she said.

Meanwhile, Uganda’s State Minister for Disaster Preparedness and Relief Musa Ecweru says there are concerns about water-borne disease outbreaks in flood-affected areas.

“Now, there’s a risk of contamination of water and if that is not handled well, then we are going to risk another phase of a challenge, an outbreak of cholera which will compound our humanitarian intervention,” he said.

Ecweru says the government has released $5.4 million for emergency drugs to treat water-borne diseases, inflatable boats, tarps, blankets, food, and repairing bridges.

Ugandan authorities say the flooding is expected to recede in January as the weather improves.

Scientists have long warned that rising ocean temperatures are making seasonal rains more severe and more frequent.

The United Nation’s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) last week (Dec 4) said unusually heavy rainfall and flooding in East Africa has affected over 2.8 million people and left at least 280 dead.

UNOCHA said the unusually heavy rainfall was driven by the differences in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the Indian Ocean.

The UN office said rains were expected to diminish in the weeks ahead but heavy rains would likely persist into December and intensify in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.","Mon, 09 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['continue', 'heavy', 'ugandas', 'say', 'week', 'waterborne', 'ugandan', 'rains', 'floods', 'uganda', 'flooding', 'death', 'toll', 'unusually', 'left', 'rises']",

Currently, Kanyangeya primary school is hosting over 98 households. The area LCI chairperson, Deogracious Isemamba said the school premises and toilets are now being used by a large community.

KASESE - Following the outbreak of floods and landslides that ravaged several areas of mountainous Kasese district, residents continue to express worry over the next course of education after several schools were washed away.

Allan Kambale a resident of Namuhuga ward in Bulembia said schools such as Bulembia primary school, Kilembe and Royal ranges secondary schools, were greatly affected by the floods, whereas others cannot be accessed after several roads and bridges were damaged.

Currently, Kanyangeya primary school is hosting over 98 households. The area LCI chairperson, Deogracious Isemamba said the school premises and toilets are now being used by a large community.

""Even if the school lock-down is lifted soon, pupils will have nowhere to study from unless an alternative area is gazetted for resettlement,"" Isemamba reasoned.

Similar concerns were raised by Rehema Aryema who decried the inevitable pressure on surviving school-premises, saying, learners are bound to meet a big challenge on how to resume studies when the lock-down is lifted.

In May this year, Kasese was hit by disastrous floods. The floods started on May 7 and peaked on the morning of May 10. Another disaster followed on May 21, in areas of Mpondwe-Bwera, where flash floods and landslides further destroyed bridges and infrastructure, leading to the death of more than 10 people.

The current flooding started with river Nyamwamba bursting its banks in areas of Kasese municipality sweeping away Kyanjuki-Katiri bridge and Kilembe mines hospital infrastructure. Simultaneous floods also occurred along rivers of Lhubiriha in Bukonzo west with impacts in the sub-counties of Kitholhu, Karambi and Mpondwe-Lhubiriha town council while river Nyamugasani in Bukonzo East had impacts in the Sub-counties of Kyondo, Kyarumba and Kisinga.

River Mubuku floods, on the other hand, had impacts on the communities of Maliba, Bugoye and Karusandara. Equally affected, were town councils of Ibanda-Kyanya, Kisinga and Mubuku.

Health services still a challenge

Asinet Kabugho recounts the incident of flooding which left several communities cut-off from each other. Some pregnant mothers remained stuck up in the hilly areas and couldn't access medical services.

""The situation was only mitigated by a certain group of volunteers who transported affected people in ambulances,"" Kabugho recollects.

After the nearest Kilembe mines hospital premises were damaged by floods, medical services were shifted to premises of St. Micheal Kindergarten and at Catholic social centre (Karitus hall) in Kasese town.

Dr Edward Wefula the hospital superintendent calls for an urgent alternative water source, mortuary, incinerator, placenta pit and more toilets, saying, the new premises were not designed for a hospital.

However, Sr. Teopista Basemera the Kilembe hospital senior administrator, expressed hope of having more structures with a 200-bed capacity.

Malteser International a worldwide humanitarian relief agency, through the prime minister's office and the ministry of health, committed relief and recovery aid worth sh868m for the period of 3months since May 12.

According to Laura Beutler the technical coordinator for emergency medical services under Malteser, as of May 13, over 39,000 people had been affected by the floods.

""We have made more than 1,317 transferals out of which, 171 babies were successfully delivered from complicated pregnancies,"" noted Laura, adding that, eight of the born babies, were delivered from within ambulances.

She hence expressed a need to build capacity in pre-hospital care, where a formidable team of residents and health workers can be trained to administer first aid before or while transferring a patient to the hospital.

For over 3months of rescue and providing relief support, Malteser trained and passed out 23 Kasese residents in providing emergency medical services among which include, first aid and ambulance operations.

""We are striving to establish an Emergency Medical Services project in Kasese so that people can respond by themselves and activate support in an immediate and structured way,"" noted Laura.

She, however, expressed fear over the possible outbreak of diseases especially the COVID-19. She said the preventive measures are largely missing at all settlement camps.

The population of the people in camp is high, the implementation of the COVID-19 SOPs is hard. Social distancing and hand washing are hard to implement.","Mon, 03 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['worried', 'health', 'medical', 'areas', 'kilembe', 'victims', 'services', 'kasese', 'affected', 'floods', 'uganda', 'premises', 'school', 'hospital', 'education']",

• Delayed and below-average cumulative rainfall has delayed planting by at least three weeks in northern and parts of eastern Uganda. Near-average rainfall is forecasted in May and will likely support the development of late-maturing crops. However, the timing of the first season cereal and legume harvests will likely be delayed through early July, and aggregate production is expected to vary by subregion depending on the local amount and distribution of rainfall. Subnational production deficits are likely in northern and eastern Uganda, where rainfall may not be spread evenly in the crop cycle.

• Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes are expected through at least September in most bimodal areas, driven by carryover stocks from 2020, below-average staple food prices, seasonal agricultural labor income during the March to May planting season, and the anticipated average harvest in July. However, Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are likely among households in flood-affected areas and some urban areas, where livelihood activities were significantly disrupted in 2020 and income sources are still below pre-pandemic levels.

• In Karamoja, an increasing number of households face widening food consumption gaps and are utilizing negative livelihoods coping strategies, increasing the share of the population that is experiencing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. While food prices are generally stable and below average in most reference markets, the casual labor wage and the price of firewood, charcoal, and goats are declining, resulting in significantly below-average terms of trade and reduced household purchasing power. Below-average rainfall to date resulted in limited on-farm labor opportunities and delayed land preparation and planting, while others lack access to seeds.

• Planned and funded food assistance (cash and in-kind) equivalent to a 60 percent ration has sustained Crisis! (IPC Phase 3!) outcomes in April. Thereafter, an anticipated pipeline break in food assistance funding may result in further reductions in rations and food security outcomes. Refugees with arable plots are engaging in plowing and planting activities, though some lack access to inputs like seeds as others have yet to recover from the impacts of earlier COVID-19 movement restrictions on food and income sources.

By Stephen Otage More by this Author

The Ministry of Water and Environment has warned all people living on river banks and lakeshores to vacate before impending floods expected from the current rising water levels.

Dr Florence Grace Odongo, the director for water resources management at the Ministry of Water and Environment, said the water level on Lake Victoria, has risen to 13.4 meters, which is only short of 8cm to reach the levels of last year and yet the rain season has just started.

“Lake Victoria is getting full and the only way water exits it is through the River Nile, which drains into Lake Kyoga and Lake Albert that empty it but all these are also getting full of water. The only thing we are going to see is flooding of River Banks and Lake Shores,” she said.

Dr Odongo was on Monday presenting her ministry’s performance in the implementation of the 2016 NRM Manifesto in Kampala on Monday.





Water levels

Dr Odongo explained that from last year’s experience where the water level on Lake Victoria hit 13.48 meters, the highest in 124 years, the situation is not looking good. This is because, she said, Lake Victoria basin traps water from Rwanda, Tanzania, DR Congo, Kenya, Tanzania and all the rain in Uganda yet the underground water system is full because of encroachment on wetlands and forests.

Mr Willis Bashasha, the director in-charge of the Manifesto Implementation Unit, noted that much as the ministry has performed well in increasing access to water and sanitation services across the country, it has done little to contain encroachment and destruction of forests and wetlands across the country.

Mr Sam Cheptoris, the minister of Water and Environment, admitted that much as they promised to increase wetland coverage from 10 per cent in 2016 to 12.4 per cent in 2021, it currently stands at 8.9 per cent due to increased population pressure. He attributed this to low enforcement of the existing laws.

“We have very few enforcement officers under the environment police. Under the 2019 Environment Act, we were supposed to recruit our own force like the Uganda Wildlife Authority but unfortunately, we do not have command over the Environmental Police to protect wetlands and forests,” Mr Cheptoris said.

The Environmental Protection Police Unit was created in December 2011 to support the Ministry of Water and Environment in enforcing environmental laws and regulations.

On Monday, the ministry was among the four ministries, which presented how they implemented the promises the ruling government made to Ugandans during the 2016 election campaigns. Other ministries are those of Science Innovations and Technology, Agriculture and Public Service.

Government has ordered all people living in flood-prone areas around Lake Victoria to relocate to safer areas as the country continues to receive heavy rain.

Mr Raphael Magyezi, the Minister for Local Government, asked district authorities to make arrangements and ensure that people swiftly vacate the affected landing sites on the lake shores.

“Heavy rains have already caused floods in some parts of the country and it is upon the victims with the help of district leaders to vacate flood prone areas for their safety,” Mr Magyezi said in an interview on Wednesday.

Last year, thousands of people were displaced after the rising water levels submerged a number of landing sites and islands around Lake Victoria and Lake Albert.

The victims were temporarily housed in makeshift shelters on the mainland as they waited for government to resettle them.

However, before government implemented the planned resettlement plan, many victims started returning to the islands and landing sites, claiming that the resettlement programme had delayed.

“The government’s plan to resettle the victims is underway although we have been constrained by lack of funds. However, people should not wait for floods to sweep them away. Let them relocate to safer places to save their lives,” Mr Magyezi said.

Masaka District alone has close to 20,000 flood victims, who were left homeless after water submerged Lambu, Kaziru, Kisuku, Malembo, and Kachanga landing sites last year.

Mr Aron Ahikiriza, a fisherman at Bukakkata Landing Site in Masaka District, said although the water levels are rising again, the lake remains their only source of livelihood.

“We can decide to sleep in rented houses far away from the landing site like we did the whole of last year but we cannot completely abandon the landing site because this where we earn a living,” he said.

Mr Rashid Babu, the manager of Mpongo Company Limited, which manages Lambu Landing Site, said government should expedite the process to permanently resettle the victims.

“Government should not be just talking, let them walk the talk because these people have been patient ever since they were promised to be resettled,” he said.

Mr Aloysius Jjuko, the chairperson of Bukakkata Sub-county, said the fishermen and their families are already scared of the rising water levels.

“We ask President Museveni to provide a permanent solution to the flood victims at landing sites. These people cannot resettle themselves unless they are helped by government,” he said.

Issue

Last year, rising water levels in various areas on Lake Victoria, Lake Kyoga, and Lake Albert shorelines wreaked havoc on many landing sites in the districts of Wakiso, Masaka, Mpigi, Kyotera, Kalangala, Mukono, Buikwe, Buvuma, Mayuge, Kayunga, Nakasongola, and Ntoroko displacing more than 40,000 people.

In Kasese District more than 100,000 people were displaced after major rivers in the area including Nyamwamba, Mubuku, Nyamughasana, and Lhubiriha burst their banks.

Susan Afoyocan’s fear of losing her restaurant business started when she saw the first drops of rain.

It was at the onset of the rainy season last month, as the farming communities eagerly began preparing their gardens that she knew she had to do something about these warning signs. Last year, around the same time, heavy rains destroyed Afoyocan’s local eatery and washed away her fruit stall in the process.

And now the 33-year-old was determined to protect her source of livelihood as she set about renovating and remodeling her restaurant as a measure to mitigate the floods.

“I know what happens when it rains here heavily…” Afoyocan, a mother of three, said as she instructed local laborers who were busy carrying tin roofs for covering her restaurant.

“I have to act very fast now or else I will lose everything again.”

As climate changes continues to take toll on Uganda –and globally— the adverse effects of the extreme weather—characterized by erratic rains and raging floods—have triggered growing concerns from climate activists and civil society organization (CSOs) who blame the government of failing to build infrastructures and enforcing preventing policies (such as tree planting along river banks and flood plains to act as a drag on flood waters) that protect disaster–prone areas like Elegu.

The business community operating at the border town have for years continuously battled the raging floods, especially during the rainy season. River Unyama, a nearby water course which often bursts its banks, has also on many occasion not spared the low-lying border town whenever it rains heavily. In November last year, more than 700 people were displaced by floods, and eight others killed, leaving 2,000 acres of crops destroyed following heavy rains in the marshy border town.

Revenue washed away

And now local leaders are accusing the government of making ‘empty promises’ instead of addressing the problem urgently. In 2018, government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Trade and Industries for the 18 billion shillings-project meant to mitigate floods in Elegu. The project, funded by Trade Mark East Africa, was meant to widen the banks of River Unyama to improve the drainage system at Elegu Town.

But four years later, nothing has been done except for only the feasibility study that was carried out by an engineering team at the construction site.

“We were promised air and now the rains are back [again],” said Bosco Onen who works at a retail shop. “For how long shall we wait while we suffer?”

Elegu, a border town with a population of close to 12,000 people, is the biggest revenue earner for Amuru district. Operations by Amuru’s local government fail to run smoothly due to financial constraints resulting majorly from the low revenue collections from the local businesses that are affected by floods.

‘[Trade ministry officials] are not feeling the pinch of the suffering of our community members whose businesses are affected [by] floods,” said Michael Lakony, Amuru District Chairman, adding, ""[They should] come to our rescue...in making sure that we curb the disaster.”

There is also information deficit regarding the progress of the project. And at moment, the Trade Ministry officials are being accused of being cagey— when it comes to giving out information about the project— by local leaders who claim they’ve been left in the dark for most of the time.

When this reporter contacted Julius Kasirye, the Project Manager for Border Export Zone–BEZ under the Ministry of Trade and Industries for comment, said:” …the matter can only be best responded to by either the Permanent Secretary [of] the Minister of Trade and Industry.”

The Trade Ministry Permanent Secretary didn’t respond to our repeated phone calls either.

But for now, as the rainy season continues to pound on, the business community at Elegu have to remain resilient and survive on their own as they wait for government support. On a recent day, as the clouds began to open up, a group of young women rushed to collect pieces of cassava spread outside on thin plastic paper for sun drying. Nearby, a young mother was busy rebuking some of kids who were playing outside in the middle of the chaos.

""If nothing is done [to help us], we will keep suffering,"" said Afoyocan.","Mon, 26 Apr 2021 15:50:05 GMT",https://www.blackstarnews.com/sites/all/themes/blackstar/favicon.ico,"['project', 'demand', 'mitigate', 'season', 'ministry', 'town', 'border', 'stalls', 'uganda', 'promised', 'elegu', 'rains', 'mega', 'floods', 'traders', 'local', 'trade']", 
4,4,FL-2020-000132-UGA,Battling Rising Water in Uganda's Wetlands - Global Press Journal,https://globalpressjournal.com/africa/uganda/battling-rising-water-ugandas-wetlands/,"KIKUUBE, UGANDA — Standing on the shore of Lake Albert, on Uganda’s western border, Sanyu Sanday looks out past the surf to where her small mud house stands partially submerged in the water. She’s salvaged what she can — her mattress and other possessions sit on a small motorboat — but after living on the lakeshore for the past two years, she’s unsure about where she will go.

“The raging waters have cut us off from what we knew as home,” Sanyu says.

Severe flooding has stricken Uganda in recent years, as changing weather patterns have led to increased rainfall, causing lakes and rivers to swell. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced across the country, particularly in flood-prone areas surrounding Lake Victoria to the south, Lake Albert to the west, and Lake Kyoga in the center of the country. It’s a situation that is likely to become worse as global temperatures rise and people continue to destroy Uganda’s wetlands to build roads, houses and other infrastructure.

Since October 2019, rising temperatures in the Indian Ocean have led to intense and prolonged rainfall in Uganda, causing water levels in Lake Victoria, one of Africa’s Great Lakes, to reach historic highs not seen since the 1960s. This has caused extreme flooding in the Lake Victoria basin.

“Too much rain means too much collected in the basin, which overspills and floods neighboring places,” says George William Omony, a senior meteorologist at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority.

Edna Namara, GPJ Uganda Sanyu Sanday’s mattress and other possessions are loaded in a small motorboat on Lake Albert. Her house, in the background, lies partially submerged in the water.

The government has been working to relocate thousands impacted by the flooding. But people like Sanyu, who built homes in parts of the Lake Victoria basin without obtaining official authorization, haven’t been included in these resettlement plans, according to Jackson Twinomujuni, commissioner of International and Transboundary Water Affairs at the Ministry of Water and Environment.

Achidria Tony, a spokesperson for the National Environment Management Authority, says that while the government can’t stop climate change or the increased rainfall it brings, officials are trying to prepare for rising water levels.

“What we do is ensure natural flood control systems such as wetlands and forests are not degraded and are instead used sustainably,” he says.

Decades ago, Uganda’s wetlands were able to absorb such flooding. But infrastructure development has caused the country’s wetlands to dwindle — from 32,000 square kilometers (12,355 square miles) in 1964 down to 26,308 square kilometers (10,158 square miles) as of 2005, according to the Ministry of Water and Environment.

“In 1961, 1964, the water was contained without alarm, because there was enough forest cover and swamps,” says Twinomujuni, referring to the historic rainfall Uganda experienced in the 1960s. “There were no paved homes and drainage channels, which do not retain any rainwater, but leave it with the only alternative to flow into the lake, hence the rise.”

Edna Namara, GPJ Uganda Nankya Amina points to the flooded ground floor of her house, along the shores of Lake Victoria in Kampala. Uganda’s wetlands have been severely depleted, due to construction and development.

Rising water is a problem in Uganda’s capital city of Kampala as well. Annual damages from flooding, which were less than $10 million in 2013, could increase to between $33 million and $102 million by 2050, according to a report by Wilson Truman Okaka, a lecturer at Kyambogo University in Kampala, who researches climate change.

In 2014, Nankya Amina built a house with rental units in a wetland area within the city’s Makindye division, along the shores of Lake Victoria. She hoped to generate income to help support herself and her six children. By law, property owners must obtain authorization from the National Environment Management Authority before they can build. But Nankya didn’t submit her plans for approval.

“I knew environmentalists would not approve my plot, since it was in the wetland,” Nankya says. “Also, I did not want to spend my money on processing the plan.”

Now she regrets the decision. The ground floor of the house is submerged in water and continues to sink, forcing her to live in a small wooden structure nearby. Even this living situation may be temporary.

“Nankya and 385 households in Makindye West division have to relocate and give back the water its territory,” says Achidria. “We sent out early warnings telling them to move before the floods.”

Sanyu, for her part, has grown accustomed to being uprooted. She initially came to Uganda in 2018 after fleeing violence in her native Democratic Republic of Congo, just across Lake Albert. She has been living in Uganda without legal documents, making money by catching and selling fish, while taking periodic trips back to DRC to check on her aging mother.

She had hoped to remain in the area and find employment cooking for workers coming to labor in the nearby oil fields. With her home destroyed, that future is now in doubt.

“We are turned double refugees,” Sanyu says, “unable to sit in either the host or mother country.”","Sun, 21 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://globalpressjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GPJ-NEWS-UGANDA-EN-DOUBLE-REFUGEES-54_web2048-650x434c.jpg,"['square', 'lake', 'house', 'sanyu', 'wetlands', 'rising', 'uganda', 'water', 'flooding', 'ugandas', 'victoria', 'battling']", 
5,5,FL-2020-000132-UGA,Poor human activities aiding Butaleja floods - Daily Monitor,https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/poor-human-activities-aiding-butaleja-floods-3394406,"By Yahudu Kitunzi More by this Author

Environmental experts and local leaders in Butaleja District have blamed the re-occurrence of floods to massive environmental degradation and lack of a political will to mitigate the effects of such disasters.

The experts say swamps and river banks of Manafwa and Nakwasi have been mismanaged by the locals due to poor agricultural methods.

They also blame the floods on failure by the government to erect embankments on River Manafwa and River Nakwasi and restore flood early warning systems.

The system, which stopped functioning in 2016, had been installed by the government in 2015 to alert locals of the rising water levels.

The concern comes following the occurrence of floods that hit the district on Friday, killing one person, destroying property worth millions of shillings and displacing many residents.

The yet unidentified resident was swept by water as he attempted to cross Nakwasi River in Leresi Cell.

Houses were submerged and household items such as beddings, clothes and crops were washed away by the ravaging floods triggered by the downpour from Mt Elgon. Transport was also paralysed and schools rendered inaccessible.

The most affected areas were Butaleja Town Council and Busolwe Town Council.

When Daily Monitor visited the affected areas, the displaced people were wandering without food, shelter, clothing, among other necessities.

The district has been experiencing back-to-back floods since 1976, and environmentalists further predict that this is likely to continue.

“Environmental degradation is rife in Butaleja District and it has been worsened by the laissez-faire approach to the disaster by authorities,” Mr James Wire, an agribusiness consultant, said.

“As of now, there are no visible efforts at an institutional level to stop this problem and it is worrying,” he added.

Mr Wire said there is a need for the district to enact by-laws that will protect the environment.

“Simple approaches such as requiring a permit before a tree is cut down in public or private land may seem harsh but bear fruits in the long run,” he said, adding that residents should be given seedlings to plant trees on the river banks.

The chairperson of Masulula “B” Village in Himutu Sub-county, Mr Mesulamu Wabaye, said there is limited land and this has forced the populace to encroach on what should be the green spaces, especially the swamps.

Ms Lamula Were, the district senior environmental officer, said the situation has been worsened by locals erecting residential houses on the river banks while others are farming and quarrying near the rivers.

“People should stop digging up to the river banks. Butaleja District is on a low land area,” she said.

Ms Were said about 60 per cent of wetlands in the district have been encroached on. She, however, said the environmental law will not spare those who are encroaching on the wetlands.

She said the district environment office has started implementing a presidential directive to restore wetlands.

Encroachment

Mr Higenyi Kemba, a resident and an opinion leader, said the main cause of the floods is human encroachment.

“Human encroachment around the river banks causes heavy silting that fills up the river bed, hence reducing the size of the waterway. When this happens, the route that water should take becomes shallow,” Mr Kemba said.

Mr Kemba said people should plant bamboo trees on either side of the river banks all the way from Bugisu Sub-region to Butaleja and Bugwere.

“Bamboo trees will stop the silting. When this is done, the deposits already in the river can then be removed...,” he said.

Mr Moses Wegulo, a resident, said repeated floods have affected them, especially in terms of food security and road network.

For example since this year started, the district has been hit by floods four times leaving hundreds of people homeless.

“This road from Mbale-Butaleja-Busolwe, which is the main link between the two districts is always cut off by floods,” he said.

Ms Madina Hifudde, another resident of Butaleja, said the affected families need urgent financial and moral support.

“We appeal to the government and other non-governmental organisations to intervene because the situation is bad,” Ms Hifudde said.

The chairperson-elect for Butaleja District, Mr Michael Higenyi Bory, said about 15,000 families have been affected by floods.

He said the crops destroyed include rice, sweet potatoes and cassava.

“We request the government to intervene and help our people. We need shelter and food,” he said.

The district environmental officer, Mr Tom Wandera, said the district is making an assessment report to submit to the Office of the Prime Minister for assistance to the affected families.

“We ask our people who are in flood-prone areas to relocate to safer places as we wait for any assistance from the government,” Mr Wandera said.

He said they have gazetted Doho Rice Scheme offices and some schools for people who have been displaced.

The Resident District Commissioner, Mr Stanly Bayole, said the government has the political will and it’s aware of the damage caused by floods.

Pupils in the Rwenzori Sub-region, whose classroom blocks and school buildings were swept off by floods in Kasese and Bundibugyo districts, can now smile again after they got new classroom blocks, pit-latrines and other facilities.

The pupils had lost any hope of resuming classes after the reopening of schools by the government.

At Bikone Primary School in Kasese District in May last year, all the classroom blocks were washed away by floods after River Mubuku burst its banks, leaving more than 500 learners stranded with nowhere to study from.

The floods from River Thaku also swept away classrooms at Kisabu Primary School also in Kasese District, leaving more than 300 pupils helpless.

Others affected by floods include Budenge and Bughonga primary schools in Bundibugyo District.

In Ntoroko District, floods from rising water levels of Lake Albert submerged all the classrooms at Umoja, Rwangara and Kachwakumu primary schools.

The new classroom blocks and other facilities were built by Save the Children, a non-governmental organisation.

The head teacher of Bikone Primary School, Mr Shem Tabura, said during lockdown in May last year, all classrooms and school records were destroyed by floods as River Mubuku burst its banks.

“We are now happy because we had lost hope for the future of our pupils as all the classroom blocks were swept away by floods. We did not have any records as text books, PLE result slips from 1989 to 2019, among others were destroyed. We are happy to see that our pupils have resumed school,” he said.

Mr Josephat Muhindo, the head teacher of Kisabu Primary School, said three classroom blocks were swept away by floods.

He said the school currently has 380 learners and have been struggling to accommodate more students.

“Our community members and other stakeholders raised about Shs12 million, which we used to buy land elsewhere to relocate the school because we were advised that where the school was located is not good, but now we have got four new classrooms and pupils are studying comfortably,” Mr Muhindo said.

He said last year in July, officials from the Office of Prime Minister promised to build seven classrooms but up to now they have not received any communication.

Mr Colenelius Masereke, a parent in Ibanda-Kyanya town council, said when floods swept away the school they lost hope about the future of their children to go back to school.

“Some people in the community died in floods and good enough it was lockdown. We did not lose any students. We are happy to see that we got new classrooms for our pupils. We shall wait for the government to make additional infrastructure,” he said.

Mr Muhindo Bagonza Libbum, the project manager of Enabling teacher approach at Save the Children, said with Shs291.4 million, they built four classrooms each at Kisabu and Bikone in Kasese District while in Bundibugyo District, they built latrines at Budenge and Bughonga primary schools.

He said they have also given the affected schools Wash facilities and SOPs, motorcycles, digital cameras, among others.

Floods

Kasese and Bundibugyo districts are prone to floods. In May 2020, rivers Mubuku and Nyamwaba burst their banks, causing floods which displaced many people and destroyed several property.

In Ntoroko District, floods displaced more than 10,000 people in Kanara Sub-county and up to now those displaced remain stranded.

7,7,FL-2020-000132-UGA,'No One Is Coming': Residents Face Devastation After Floods - Global Press Journal,https://globalpressjournal.com/africa/uganda/no-one-coming-residents-face-devastation-floods/,"KASESE, UGANDA — Around 1 a.m. on May 7, 2020, Lorna Bambu heard screams.

Frightened voices told her, her seven children and their neighbors to run. Heavy rains had soaked western Uganda’s mountainous Kasese region the day before, and now the area’s rivers had burst their banks. Torrents of water rushed into the valley, destroying homes, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure.

Bambu, 37, tried to escape. “I was stuck. The water was to my knees, and my hands held two of my youngest children,” she says. “We held onto whatever we could until help came in the morning.”

Bambu’s house was swept away in the flooding, but she and her children survived. Her husband was not so lucky. “My husband, who was at a bar when it happened, tried to get to us but was injured by a moving log,” she says. “As we could not get medical help in time, he died.”

The Kilembe Mines Hospital, the region’s primary medical center, which serves more than 20,000 residents, would normally have been accessible by an easy 15-minute walk. But the flooding destroyed the hospital and made area roads impassable, cutting off the region from other health care facilities.

Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda Water, rocks and mud swept through the Kilembe Mines Hospital and destroyed the medical center. Staff members were able to evacuate patients, and the hospital has reopened on a provisional basis at a new location.

The flooding affected more than 100,000 people in the region. At least 1,200 were left homeless and 18 were killed, says Godfrey Kabbyanga, mayor of the Kasese Municipal Council.

The dire situation is a consequence of environmental changes, as well as growing political and socioeconomic concerns. As a result, disasters like this are likely to become more common in the years ahead.

“In Kasese, rivers have been known to flood periodically since the 1940s,” says Evelyn Mugume, environment officer for the Kasese municipality. Climate change is causing snow in the mountains to melt, she says, increasing the frequency and severity of the flooding. Local residents also have been illegally building homes and farms along the banks of River Nyamwamba, one of the main rivers in the region, making the land too unstable to control the floodwaters.

“Areas along the riverbanks are supposed to be managed by government, but people have got to own plots there,” Mugume says. “They have degraded this land, because not all of them know how to manage it. Politicians use lip service to protect illegal occupants. They do not advocate enough for environment protection.”

The government has put forward plans to restore the riverbanks by constructing barriers to protect infrastructure and calling on residents to plant bamboo and reeds, which can help control erosion.

Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda Flooding from River Nyamwamba cut off one of the main roads in the Kasese area, affecting thousands of residents. Local officials are still assessing damage in the region and deciding how to proceed with reconstruction.

But Centenary Robert Franco, a member of Parliament who represents the Kasese municipality, says the responsibility for managing the land lies elsewhere.

“It’s not my duty to protect the environment – there are organizations for that,” he says. “We do not make these people stay on the land.”

Local residents say they are aware of efforts to restore the riverbanks, but the plans don’t put food on their tables, leaving them with no choice but to continue to build and farm along the river. “I cannot grow bamboo on the small land I have,” says Bera Edith, 36, a mother of five whose house was destroyed in mudslides last May.

Since the flooding, Bera, Bambu and approximately 900 other residents of the region have been living in tents and semipermanent houses in the Kibota Seventh Day Adventist Camp for internally displaced people.

Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda The Kibota Seventh Day Adventist Camp houses approximately 900 people from the Kasese region. Conditions in the camp have been deteriorating, and residents have appealed to the government to provide better accommodations and sanitation.

Conditions in the camp are deteriorating, according to Sikabyahoro Jimmy, the camp’s chairman.

“Many have symptoms of typhoid and malaria, and there are no drugs in the nearest health center,” he says. He adds that aid workers at the camp have been overwhelmed and that the last delivery of supplies was in October.

“There is no food, the hospital is far,” he says. “We have called for help, but no one is coming.”

Centenary says the government is aware of conditions in the camp and is trying to get the displaced residents food and other necessities, and permanently resettle them in areas less prone to flooding. But finding available land to house them has proven challenging, and many Kasese residents say they would like to return to their original homes, despite the risk of flooding.

Kabbyanga, Kasese’s mayor, says local officials are still working to assess the damage to the area. For Bambu and other Kasese residents, however, rebuilding has become a way of life.

“The mountains do get angry, but sometimes you get a rainbow after the storm,” she says. “I just hope to never experience the rage of the rivers again. I pray that for my children as well.”","Tue, 26 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://globalpressjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GPJNews_Uganda_PL_Hospitalbridge_-34_web2048-650x434c.jpg,"['devastation', 'camp', 'rivers', 'coming', 'land', 'help', 'region', 'residents', 'kasese', 'floods', 'uganda', 'flooding', 'hospital', 'face']", 
8,8,FL-2020-000132-UGA,Uganda 'When It Rains … We Cry': River Submerges Livelihoods - Global Press Journal,https://globalpressjournal.com/africa/uganda/rains-cry-overflowing-river-submerges-livelihoods/,"ELEGU, UGANDA — It didn’t rain the day 2-year-old Raymond Giga was found submerged in water next to the bed he shared with his mother.

But the River Unyama still poured in from the east and swallowed him, says Raymond’s mother, Sylvia Gimono, her eyes wet with tears. Raymond was two weeks shy of celebrating his third birthday when he tumbled off the bed into water pooling on the floor. His mother, in a nearby room, didn’t hear a sound.

An hour after his sister found him, Raymond was pronounced dead.

Gimono, who runs a small motel in this burgeoning community on the border of Uganda and South Sudan, blames the flood for taking her child’s life and decimating her business. She moved to the northern town of Elegu to make a living off increased trade as both countries, after years of internal conflict, settled into periods of peace. But she encountered a new kind of threat.

The November flood, which left thousands homeless and ruined numerous operations like Gimono’s, wasn’t the first. Destructive floods have overwhelmed the area multiple times in recent years as increasingly heavy rains meet with the side effects of a swelling population, including uprooted trees along the river’s banks and the destruction of wetlands through farming. While some officials point to the ramifications of growth, residents accuse the government of failing to implement a long-promised flood mitigation plan that may have spared businesses and saved the lives of children like Raymond.

Nakisanze Segawa, GPJ Uganda Ugandans who live near the border with South Sudan chopped trees along the riverbank to make room for an increasing population. This has made it more difficult to prevent flooding.

Government officials “are not feeling the pitch of the suffering of the people,” says Michael Lakony, a chairperson of the district where Elegu is located, about 163 kilometers (101 miles) from the nearest big city, Gulu. “This is a known disaster and should be easy to deal with.”

The town sits in a low-lying area especially susceptible to floods. “When it rains in Gulu,” he says, “in Elegu we cry.”

Uganda is experiencing more frequent and fierce droughts and floods, according to a 2018 climate change profile by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Rainfall is expected to increase, particularly here in the country’s north, escalating the risk of natural disasters.

Floods killed seven people last year, displaced more than 4,000 community members, and ruined billions of Ugandan shillings’ worth of goods, including cement and maize, Lakony says. Gulu received more than 90 centimeters (35 inches) of rainfall from September to November, about double the usual average, according to data from the national weather agency.

Nakisanze Segawa, GPJ Uganda Elegu sits in a low-lying area susceptible to flooding. Residents say the government hasn’t done enough to address the increased risk.

The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives could have solved the flooding problem in 2018, Lakony says, when it signed a memorandum of understanding with TradeMark East Africa, a Nairobi-based nonprofit focused on trade, to implement a flood mitigation plan worth 1.8 billion shillings (about $490,000). The plan called for constructing a drainage system to contain the floods and creating channels 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from Elegu to divert the water.

The area, by that point, had grown from a scattering of grass-thatched homes to a substantial community with a tarmacked road, the groan of breaking trucks and the constant buzz of moving commerce.

The growth started in 2008, soon after the end of Uganda’s two-decade civil war, which displaced nearly 2 million residents and, according to some estimates, killed more than 100,000 people. Three years later, South Sudan gained independence from Sudan and officially became a country. And the village of Elegu became a town.

Elegu’s population has grown about 30 times since 2012, when it had 4,000 residents, Lakony says. But nothing has come of the flood plan.

Government officials disagree. Amelia Kyambadde, the minister for Trade, Industry and Cooperatives, says an initial evaluation showed the area was too swampy to implement the mitigation plan. Government engineers are aware of the situation, she says, and are working with TradeMark East Africa on an alternative solution. She declined to discuss the timeframe.

TradeMark East Africa didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Nakisanze Segawa, GPJ Uganda Elegu’s main road lacks a drainage system that would help ward against devastating floods.

Wilfred Baguma, a local councilman, says water overflow has been an issue since the 1970s. But increased rain and farming near the snaking Unyama riverbank have worsened the problem.

Low-lying areas like Elegu tend to flood because residents have chopped down the trees near and along the river that could have contained overflow, says Joshua Zaake, executive director of Environmental Alert, a nongovernmental organization based in Kampala.

Many who have benefitted from growth are now the ones suffering. Sarah Nakizza, a household goods trader at Elegu market, has lost products to the floods. When the water flows through the market at night, she says, most of her stored goods get swept away.

Ugandans in the region initially made money exporting food, water, soap, eggs and construction materials to the newly independent South Sudan. But Elegu quickly grew into a way station for people who desired goods from either side — cooking oil, sugar and tinned milk are cheaper in South Sudan, for example — and for traders in need of accommodation.

Trucks lining the main road have Kenyan, Tanzanian and Ugandan license plates. Vendors sell sliced pineapples along a street crammed with lodges and a boisterous market.

Some now fear the repercussions of that development. Residents like Gimono demand a clearer strategy to deal with the lack of drainage channels and other mitigation techniques. If for nothing else, she says, than for her son.

Otherwise, “next time it will be another woman’s child killed by floods.”

For most of that time, Uganda’s government has been trying to chase him away.

Now, it is the water itself that has driven him from his small house on the edge of Entebbe, a Ugandan town that juts into Africa’s largest lake.

Thousands have been displaced from their homes along the shoreline by the worst flooding since records began more than a century ago. Musasizi, who works as a truck driver, is renting a room on higher ground until the waters recede.

“Homes have been destroyed,” said Musasizi, whose family came here originally seeking cheap land. “My friends are now on the streets.”

The Ugandan government has said people like Musasizi are partly to blame for the floods, and wants them to leave the wetlands for good.

It plans to start evicting people without compensation this month - in the middle of a coronavirus lockdown that has hit the poor hardest.

‘RICH WILL REMAIN’

Alfred Okot Okidi, the top civil servant at the ministry of water and environment, said 700,000 Ugandans had been affected by flooding nationwide, almost all of whom live illegally in the protected zones around lakes and rivers.

Settlement, cultivation and industry were destroying the wetlands, which act as “natural sponges” to absorb excess rainfall, Okidi told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The evictions are in line with a directive issued by President Yoweri Museveni, who warned in an address last week that the floods “should be an eternal lesson to all of us”.

That is a message heard with scepticism in the swamps of Entebbe, where houses crumble into the water and men fish in flooded gardens.

Peter Kisakye Zzimula, the pastor of a church on the wetlands, argued that people only build there because they cannot afford to rent property elsewhere.

“Nobody would wish to be here but people are oppressed,” he said. “If you evict them, where will they go?”

The rains over east Africa have been unusually heavy since last year and climate scientists have predicted more such weather in future.

But the flooding is exacerbated by local factors including the destruction of forests and wetlands, said Frank Muramuzi, executive director of the National Association of Professional Environmentalists, a civil society group.

Muramuzi said wealthy investors were snapping up land to grow rice or flowers for sale, and set up hotels and resorts.

“All those establishments are being done by rich people and some them have connections in government,” he said.

“The poor people will be evicted, but the rich people will remain.”

‘GOD HAS COME’

Last year, wetlands covered just 8.4% of Uganda, down from 15.5% in 1994, according to the environment ministry.

In 2014 the government ordered the cancellation of all land titles there, issued illegally by local officials because the law prohibits private ownership of wetlands.

A subsequent survey of four central districts identified 1,700 titles in wetlands, said Collins Oloya, the acting director of environmental affairs at the environment ministry.

But the process has become bogged down in lengthy court proceedings and only 300 titles have so far been cancelled.

Now the rising waters are forcing people out of the wetlands, doing Oloya’s work for him.

“I’m very happy that God has come,” he said.

But the political pressures that have stymied past threats of eviction may do so again, with elections scheduled for next year.

Police fired teargas at protesting vendors last month as they shut down a flooded market on another stretch of shoreline.

“We need to conserve the environment, but at the same time we need to be conscious that we are dealing with human beings,” said Kayanja Vincent de Paul, the mayor of Entebbe.

“It is a hotcake. If you handle it badly, it can burn you up.”

SUSPICION

Tensions are heightened by popular suspicion. Musasizi, the truck driver, believes governments have engineered the floods to grab land from the poor.

“After this water has chased these poor people, more hotels are going to be built here,” he said.

Meanwhile Judith Amojong, another resident, is hoping for divine intervention.

She used to sleep in the local church with a few other homeless worshippers.

One day she foresaw a great flood. “I got a dream where the world was full of water,” she recalled.

Soon after, the waters started seeping under the corrugated iron walls, bringing coldness and snakes.

Amojong, who is now sheltering at the house of a fellow churchgoer, hopes that she will not have to return.

As anticipated, an outbreak of cholera was later confirmed by the Ministry of Health in Bududa district two weeks after the launch of this DREF operation, which affected the same community affected by the landslides. A total of 72 cholera cases, with 3 deaths were recorded (Case Fatality Rate=4.17%). The operation therefore refocussed its strategy towards provision of safe water, improved sanitation, and hygiene behaviours among the affected and other at-risk communities in Bududa, Sironko, Butaleja and Mbale districts. The Ministry of Health later launched Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaign in Bududa where the operation supported with community mobilization that increased uptake of the vaccine among all at-risk individuals. All these efforts led to rapid interruption of the cholera outbreak spread in Bududa that prevented it from affecting other at-risk areas in neighbouring Manafwa, Namisindwa, Butaleja, Sironko, Mbale and Bulambuli districts.

On 20 June 2019, IFRC launched a DREF operation worth CHF 151,041 to support Uganda Red Cross Society respond to humanitarian needs of 2,845 people affected by landslides and floods disasters in Bududa, Mbale, Butaleja, and Sironko district. The emergency operation successfully ran from June to September 2019, although the heavy rainfall situation was still widespread, which caused fresh flooding events in completely new areas around November 2019, just two months after closure of this operation.","Wed, 24 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1557103-MDRUG042dfr.png?itok=UygFxY8C,"['cholera', 'mdrug042', 'landslides', 'final', 'mbale', 'butaleja', 'sironko', 'operation', 'report', 'dref', 'district', '2019', 'affected', 'floods', 'uganda', 'n', 'bududa']",

The Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA) has warned that some parts of the country are likely to experience strong winds and hailstorms as the rainy season sets in.

The authority has asked Ugandans to take precaution because there will be cases of thunderstorm, lightning and hailstorms.

The alert issued by the authority in a tweet on Monday said: “Alert! The rains expected in most parts of the country are likely to be associated with medium to strong winds. Be sure to reinforce your roofs for living houses, granary stores, and others; if there is need. Keep safe.”

Dr Festus Luboyera, the UNMA executive director, said there is a high likelihood of having rains above normal levels in several parts of the country.

“The onset of seasonal rains is anticipated to be characterised by severe isolated lightning, thunder and hailstorms,” he warned.

He said the predicted rains forecast should be used for planning in all rain-fed economic activities so as to improve economic welfare and livelihoods for all communities in their localities.

“UNMA will continue to monitor the evolution of relevant weather systems, particularly the state of the Seas Surface Temperature and Indian Ocean Dipole, and issue appropriate rainfall alerts, updates and advisories to the users regularly, especially to those areas that have been heavily affected by floods and landslides disasters,” he added.

Dr Luboyera said the major physical conditions that are likely to influence the increased rainfall for the next three months in Uganda include the current and evolving Sea Surface Temperature anomalies over global oceans.

He specifically pointed out the increased probability for Neutral El Nino Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole through the months of March, April and May period.

Dr Luboyera said the expected rains in most parts of the country may, however, present good prospects for improved agricultural production.

“Farmers and other agricultural practitioners are highly encouraged to take advantage of the expected good rains to optimise food and crop production,” he said.

He also advised farmers to plant trees, restock livestock farms, fish ponds and apiaries.

Dr Luboyera warned that there will be floods in central Uganda and landslides in mountainous areas of Kigezi, Rwenzori and the Elgon regions. He also warned that there could be an invasion of locusts.

“The disaster risk management institutions should review their contingency plans,” he said.

He said areas expected to receive average to above average rainfall should undertake integrated flood management, flood preparedness and mitigation strategies in flood-prone areas and plans for optimisation of power generation and distribution should be enhanced due to the expected increased discharge of seasonal rain water into the water bodies.

He said the urban areas should prepare for the flash floods by clearing water and drainage channels.

“Urban authorities need to clear and reduce blockages of the drainage systems to avoid water logging on streets. Strong winds may be experienced, which can cause structural damages to buildings,” he said.

Impact on health

Dr Festus Luboyera, the UNMA executive director, said there is high risk of malaria in wetter areas of Teso, Lake Victoria basin, Lake Kyoga basin, lowlands adjacent to Elgon region, and risk of cholera is expected in Buliisa, Busia, South western, Bulambuli, Karamoja sub-region and Namayingo District.

“There is, therefore, need to conduct community awareness about the potential outbreak of the diseases in context and surveillance,” he said.

Then came the alarms raised by those living in the hilltop areas, those who could run, racing down to warn people along the valley and lowlands to run. A torrent of water was on its way down the mountain. Four rivers in Kasese district – the Nyamwamba, Mubuku, Nyamughasana and Lhubiriha – had burst their banks.

“I realised a disaster was coming. It was a matter of life and death,” Masika, 34, tells the Guardian. “I ran back to the house to wake up my husband and children. I knocked and alerted our neighbours. The floods and stones are coming to kill us,” she says.

That night heavy rains in the area of western Uganda swept away homes, schools, submerged farms, cut off bridges and left several roads inaccessible, affecting 24,760 houses and an estimated 173,000 people, according to a disaster committee interim assessment report.

“We couldn’t sleep on the hill. It was so cold. The children were crying. There was nothing I could do,” says Masika as she lights a fire to cook at a makeshift home in Kilembe, about 10km north-west of Kasese town.

“We came back in the afternoon after the water had receded and saw the great devastation of the floods. The water destroyed and swept away everything,” she says. “We have been left homeless and very desperate. Where do we start from? We need urgent assistance.”

A few kilometres down the road of this tourist region, Philly Donald Baluku, a travel guide, said the impact was a disaster. “I have been working as a tour guide on a contract basis. The tourism sector closed because of Covid-19 restrictions. The floods have rendered me homeless now,” says Baluku.

“What do I do? I have nine dependents. My brother has offered us a single room to stay. But we don’t have bedding and food. We are living in a very hopeless and desperate situation.

“All my property, banana plantations, vanilla and crops which I was supposed to harvest in September were swept away.”

The floodwater destroyed the Nyamwamba hydroelectric power station, and overran the wards, mortuary and drug stores of Kilembe Mines hospital.

The villages of Kyanjuki, Bulembia and Katiri are now buried under mud and huge stones that were propelled down the mountain. Homes on lower land are submerged in water.

“I haven’t seen anything like this. I’m seeing for the first time where everything has been run down,” says Stephen Oluka, the director of Uganda’s National Emergency Coordination and Operations Centre, on a visit to Kasese town.

“The infrastructure has been damaged. The hospital and power station has been overrun. People’s houses along the path have all been swept away. Gardens, crops and cows have been taken away,” he says.

Buildings damaged by the flooding at Kilembe

Schools and churches have been designated temporary displacement camps.

“The living conditions are bad and alarming. The basic facilities are lacking,” says Catherine Kugoza, 37, a mother of six, sheltering in Karusandara church, about 20km south of Kasese.

“We are starving. People are taking dirty water from the stream. The one latrine is full. People are defecating in the open. This is a recipe for disease outbreaks like cholera and dysentery.”

When the Guardian visited Karusandara on Saturday, the camp was hosting more than 1,000 people, mostly women and children, with just 18 tents supplied by Save the Children.

“It’s a crisis situation. We have children in the camps. They don’t have blankets, they need mosquito nets, people don’t have food,” says Robert Centenary, a lawmaker for Kasese municipality. “People don’t have supplies for purifying water; they don’t have utensils to use in the camps. The situation has caused an appalling sanitation crisis. We may end up degenerating into a cholera outbreak.

“We really need a lot of water and sanitation support. We want the government to immediately come to the rescue of the people.”

The Uganda Red Cross Society says the immediate needs include shelter, food, bedding, mosquito nets, utensils, mobile toilets, water storage facilities and tarpaulins. It is appealing for more resources.

Oluka says overcrowding in makeshift centres had complicated efforts to combat Covid-19. “The guidelines have been compromised. I didn’t see anyone [displaced] in the camps with a mask. The leaders are telling people to maintain social distancing but it’s not attainable. There is overcrowding in camps.”

He adds: “I don’t think they are now bothered about coronavirus, which they haven’t seen. They are bothered about what has affected them now [floodings], safety from waters and their livelihoods.”

In its outlook for March to May, Uganda’s National Meteorological Authority warned of heavy rainfall over several parts of the country, which could lead to flooding and landslides, causing loss of lives, destruction of property and infrastructure.

Floods and landslides have killed 194 people in neighbouring Kenya and 65 in north-west Rwanda in the past week. On Sunday morning, there was another wave of flash floods in Uganda.

“We have looked at the magnitude of the problem. It is too huge. It requires immediate, medium and long-term interventions,” says Oluka.

By Justus Wanzala

BUDALANGI, Kenya, Aug 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Women dashed around open kitchens dotted across the playground of Bubango Primary School, preparing to feed the hundreds of children who now call the school in western Kenya their home.

About 400 families from Budalangi, in Busia County, have been living at the school since April, when the Nzoia River that flows from Kenya's western highlands into Lake Victoria burst its banks in the worst flooding the area has seen in decades.

After more than a year of unusually heavy rainfall, over 800,000 Kenyans have been displaced by flooding, according to the government.

The situation has been made worse by flooded rivers channelling huge volumes of water into Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake, causing it to spill over onto its shores - a phenomenon called ""backflow"".

""We lost everything when our homes got inundated with water. Houses have been destroyed, livestock and crops swept away,"" said Hesborne Opondo, 45, who lost his shop to the rising lake.

His wife now sells flatbread to others living at Bubango school to support their six children, he added.

Scientists warn that other massive flood events may be ahead as climate change strengthens, and some have urged the three countries that share the lake - Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania - to work together to put systems in place to lessen flood damage.

""There should be a joint effort in dealing with disaster management and preparedness in the lake region,"" said Alfred Owuor Opere, a climate and water expert at the University of Nairobi.

Management of the dams that regulate the flow of water into Lake Victoria should especially be a regional concern, as the area is expected to receive enhanced rainfall in future, he added.

While Budalangi is no stranger to flooding, in recent years the damage has been limited by two dykes the government built 20 years ago along the Nzoia River and on the southern shore of Lake Victoria, according to local elders.

But this year, the dykes could not contain the flooding - the most severe the area has seen since the 1960s, say experts, who attribute it to a combination of climate change and the erosion of shores by urbanisation and farming.

A year of extraordinarily heavy rains, which started in April 2019 following a drought, pushed the lake's water level up to 13.4 metres (44 feet) in May, breaking the previous 1964 record, according to the Lake Victoria Basin Commission.

In normal years, the lake has an average level of 12 metres.

While the waters that burst from the Nzoia have started to recede, the backflow from the lake is still flooding surrounding areas, residents said.

DAM DIPLOMACY

With climate change likely a major contributor to the recent flooding, the nations around Lake Victoria must work together to tackle the problem, said Joseph Awange, a professor of earth sciences at Curtin University in the Australian city of Perth.

""Engineering measures such as damming and planting trees to regulate the use of water could be considered,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email interview.

Uganda, where Lake Victoria feeds into the Nile River, is seen as a key player in preventing flooding in the region, he noted.

Since its construction in 1954, Uganda's Nalubaale dam has controlled the flow of water out of Lake Victoria into the Nile, in line with a treaty between Uganda and Egypt, he explained.

If the water in the dam rises above a certain level, Uganda must release some to maintain the natural flow of the Nile.

Leaders in western Kenya have accused Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni of not doing enough to control backflow.

In June, Raphael Wanjala, a member of parliament for Budalangi, called on the East African Legislative Assembly to intervene and urged Museveni to complete the ongoing construction of another dam along the Nile.

But Sam Cheptoris, Uganda's environment minister, told media in May that the rapid rise of Lake Victoria was due to a mix of environmental degradation, poor land use practices and urbanisation that has stopped the ground absorbing rainfall.

These factors resulted in the ""speedy movement of water into the lakes and rivers"" feeding into Lake Victoria, he said.

SILTED RIVERS

George William Omony, a senior meteorologist at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority, said that above-average rainfall plays a major role in causing backflow but the phenomenon has been amplified by human activities.

He pointed to the growing number of villages and farms on Lake Victoria's shores, which are protected areas where human settlement and farming is prohibited.

When forests along the rivers that feed into the lake are cleared for farming, they lose trees whose roots hold onto soil and minimise the amount of mud and silt that end up in rivers.

When rivers become silted, they can hold less water before overflowing or pushing it back into the lake, he explained.

He and other climate experts said the recent extreme flooding is linked to a cyclical process of drought and heavy rainfall that happens in the Lake Victoria area every 50 years or so.

""While it is difficult to tell when the cycle will repeat, the chances of it happening again are high,"" Omony added.

BENEFITING COMMUNITIES

Opere, at the University of Nairobi, said Lake Victoria communities and the government could also work together to reduce the risk of backflow and flooding.

He suggested planting trees along rivers and building channels to carry floodwater away from the lake and into water pans and reservoirs to use for livestock and irrigation.

He also stressed the importance of dams in regulating the amount of water flowing into Lake Victoria.

Plans by Kenya's government to build major dams to curb flooding along the Nyando, Nzoia and Yala rivers - the first of which is due to start construction on the Nyando in September - will help protect and support local communities, he added.

Government officials have said residents will be allowed to fish in the water behind the dams and use it for domestic and agricultural purposes.

""The dams will have a huge impact in reducing this flooding menace around the lake while providing economic opportunities for people living in these areas,"" Opere said.

Hundreds of people have been killed by floodwaters in Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Rwanda and Ethiopia which have also displaced hundreds of thousands across the region.

Heavy overnight rains flooded areas around Mountain Rwenzori in Western Uganda after the River Nyamwamba burst its banks, forcing people to seek refuge in nearby schools and destroying roads and bridges, a senior government official said.

“What complicates the matter is that this is the era of COVID. People are expected to maintain social distance but how do you maintain distance in such a situation?” Julius Mucunguzi, spokesman for the prime minister’s office, said by telephone.

One of the hospitals in the area, Kilembe, was also overrun by the gushing waters despite being built on a raised bank and reinforced with sandbags.

“There are wards which were completely washed away. The mortuary was swept away. You wouldn’t know that once upon a time there was a mortuary there. The drugs and drug stores were washed away,” Mucunguzi said.

In Ethiopia, the Somali region in the east of the country has borne the brunt of the floods, which have displaced more than 100,000 people, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

In neighbouring Somalia, an unspecified number of people were killed when floods washed away an entire small town in the semi-autonomous Puntland region, officials said.

The heavy rains stem from moisture dumped in the region by winds coming in from the Indian Ocean where temperatures have risen in recent months, Chris Shisanya, a professor of climatology at Nairobi-based Kenyatta University, said.

“This is a carry-over of what we had last year,” he said, referring to floods and landslides in the region.

Nearly 200 people in Kenya have been killed by the floods, which have also displaced 100,000 more.

“This is compounding the COVID-19 response,” Kenya Health Ministry Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman told a news conference.

“As members of from sugar growing areas, we would like to register our dismay at the casual nature in which the trade ministry has continued to handle an issue that has potential of destroying the livelihoods of eight million Kenyans who depend on the industry,” Koyoo said.

“While the Agriculture Committee investigating the circumstances under which 10 companies belonging to two individuals imported 47,000 metric tons without the prerequisite pre-shipment inspection from the Sugar Directorate, the same Trade ministry which has been mentioned as having overstepped mandate has gone ahead to sign a communiqué’, a clear affront to Parliament and its institutions.”

Okelo said they will not allow a grain of the imported sugar to enter into the country and flood the market linking the importation deal to the coming 2022 elections campaign funding.

“Towards elections, things like sugar importation and hike in fuel prices become common since sugar barons and cartels are trying to raise money for campaigns,” Okelo said.

Odege said Uganda has no advantage over Kenya in terms of sugar production faulting the government for doing little to revive the country’s sugar sector.

“This will open floodgates for other people to import sugar from other countries through Uganda and the net effect is that all our factories will die,” Naicca said.

At least 16 bodies have been recovered after torrential rain caused landslides in western Uganda, the Red Cross has said.

“Our team continues to recover more bodies including some that are trapped by cocoa trees in Bundibugyo hills. It is a very devastating moment,” the humanitarian agency said in a tweet on Sunday.

An aid team has been deployed to search and recover bodies in Bundibugyo district, which was affected by the landslides after days of heavy rainfall.

“We have provided body bags and blankets to manage the dead in a dignified manner before handing them over to families and hospitals,” Irene Nakasita, Red Cross spokeswoman, said.

The East African nation is undergoing its second rainy season, which has reached its peak in most parts of the country. The Uganda National Meteorological Authority has predicted heavy rainfall will continue throughout December.

The heavy rains have caused destructive flooding in several low-lying parts of the country and landslides in the mountainous regions. Destructive wind and hailstorms have ravaged plantations and crops across Uganda.

More than 20 people have been killed as a result of floods and mudslides in the last week in Uganda. The eastern parts of the country have also been suffering floods and landslides around the Mount Elgon region.

In a statement on Friday, Musa Ecweru, Uganda’s minister of state for disaster preparedness, said: “Four people were killed in Bududa district and another four including two children in Sironko district.”

“Over 10,000 people have been displaced in eastern Uganda alone and we are currently reviewing villages’ household registers to establish the number and names of missing persons,” Ecweru said.

The government has now released more than $5.4m for emergency procurement.

These include inflatable boats, tarpaulins, blankets, relief food, drugs for water-borne diseases and culverts for fixing washed away bridges.

The extreme weather has been blamed on the Indian Ocean Dipole – a climate system defined by the difference in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the ocean.

At the moment, the ocean around East Africa is far warmer than usual, resulting in higher evaporation and moist air flowing inwards over the continent as rain: the hallmarks of a “positive” dipole.

Description of the disaster

On 12 December 2019, Uganda Red Cross Society (URCS) with support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), launched a DREF operation in response to landslide events which occurred following prolonged rainfall from 29 November and 3 December 2019 the districts of Mbale and Bududa in Eastern Region of Uganda. These landslides affected 380 households (1,900 people). These landslides occurred in the broader context of extensive flooding across the whole of Uganda, which started in October and continued throughout December 2019.

During the assessments, URCS working with government (district and National teams such as the DDMCs) rescued and provided temporary shelters as well as psychosocial support to the affected and most vulnerable persons using resources at hand. Indeed, within the same period, Uganda had experienced another major flood and landslide in the Western region of Bundibugyo with 4,436HH 30,919 individuals (14,873Males and 16,046 Females) affected with 2,450 of those displaced and living in the two camps of Simuliki and Bubukwanga camps. As such, the NS extended the scope of the response to provide WASH assistance to the families affected in this district, which allowed URCS to reach 37,603 people (approx. 7,520 HH) through this DREF operation.","Mon, 01 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1557671-Uganda%20-%20Landslides%20Final%20Report%20-%20DREF%20Operation%20MDRUG043.png?itok=KKz80Nxs,"['mdrug043', 'landslides', 'urcs', 'red', 'final', 'operation', 'report', 'support', 'dref', 'response', 'region', 'occurred', 'affected', 'uganda']",

A week of heavy rains caused floods and mudslides in Eastern Uganda’s Bugisu and Bundibugyo regions near Rwenzori Mountain.



Authorities say the flooding has taken a toll with the loss of life and property, and with thousands more left stranded.



The Ugandan Red Cross’s Irene Nakasita says search and rescue operations in the regions are hampered as most roads have been washed away.



“And the decision has been taken to put up a transit shelter until the situation normalizes. So, most likely Bubukwang transit center is going to house close to 700 people who are displaced in Bundibugyo,” she said.



Meanwhile, Uganda’s State Minister for Disaster Preparedness and Relief Musa Ecweru says there are concerns about water-borne disease outbreaks in flood-affected areas.



“Now, there’s a risk of contamination of water and if that is not handled well, then we are going to risk another phase of a challenge, an outbreak of cholera which will compound our humanitarian intervention,” he said.



Ecweru says the government has released $5.4 million for emergency drugs to treat water-borne diseases, inflatable boats, tarps, blankets, food, and repairing bridges.



Ugandan authorities say the flooding is expected to recede in January as the weather improves.



Scientists have long warned that rising ocean temperatures are making seasonal rains more severe and more frequent.



The United Nation’s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) last week (Dec 4) said unusually heavy rainfall and flooding in East Africa has affected over 2.8 million people and left at least 280 dead.

UNOCHA said the unusually heavy rainfall was driven by the differences in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the Indian Ocean.

The UN office said rains were expected to diminish in the weeks ahead but heavy rains would likely persist into December and intensify in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

As the world battles a pandemic, large swaths of the African continent have been —literally — submerged by floods.

Since March, this crisis has left more than 400 people dead in East Africa. A separate round of flooding has hit West Africa’s Sahel region.

In Uganda, Catholic Relief services estimates that as many as 580,000 people are affected.

Country director Niek de Goeij says ""It's kind of affecting all kinds of people. You know, in Kampala, our capital city, it affects people who have nice houses on the lakeshore. But if you are in the Mount Elgon area, on the border with Kenya; or you're in the Kasese area, on the border with the D.R. Congo, and you’re a smallholder farmer normally benefits from farming on a river bank. And suddenly there’s this raging flash floods that comes down to hills and mountains because of this very intense rainfall — you know, you lose everything. You lose your house, you lose your land. And so it's a very diverse group of people that is affected.”

In the eastern town of Jinja, along the shores of Lake Victoria, radio host and environmental activist John Hillary says flooding doesn’t just destroy homes it ruins the very fabric that holds society together.

“The public hospital, the only public hospital in the Chilembwe region, was completely destroyed. So people as a result of the floods got sick. But they could not get anywhere else to go to because the hospital had been destroyed,” he said.

De Goeij says heavy rainfall is normal in East Africa — what isn’t, he says, is their frequency and intensity. And, he says, the pandemic makes it harder for groups like his to respond.

“It's like a triple crisis in Uganda, right? We have the locusts, we have all the floods. And then, on top of everything else, we have COVID-19. And so it's been, for the affected people, it’s been an especially hard year, you know, to be on a lockdown and be affected by floods, and then because of the lockdown, accessing the support and the relief that that they're entitled to,” he said.

Hillary, who speaks often about climate change on his radio show, says that to him and other activists, this is personal.

“My mom is a gardener. My grandparents, and many people in my family, are farmers. That's what I've known,"" he said. ""Growing up, I always went with my mom to the garden to dig, and we ate food from the gardens.

I'm only 26. I have seen over time my world deteriorating. I don't want to see the same for my children.”

This, he says, is a living nightmare. This is his home, and he wants future generations to see its beauty, too.","Tue, 13 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/kaltura-video-thumbs/1_z/1_zr629y9g.jpg,"['africa', 'large', 'lose', 'rainfall', 'youre', 'relief', 'east', 'widespread', 'know', 'destroyed', 'devastate', 'floods', 'uganda', 'world', 'hospital', 'sections']", 
26,26,FL-2020-000132-UGA,Lake Victoria Breathes Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic: Recaptures Its Tributaries - Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/lake-victoria-breathes-amidst-covid-19-pandemic-recaptures-its-tributaries,"The intensive and prolonged rainfall in Uganda and East African region has caused a rise in water levels of Lake Victoria and all major water bodies in the country.

Recognizing that many parts of Uganda including Lake Victoria received above normal rainfall between mid- April to late June, 2020, water levels have risen further resulting in floods with severe effects around the country.

At Ggaba landing site located North of Lake Victoria and Port Bell, a small industrial Centre in the South of the Lake, life and settlement has been disrupted by the flooding water that has submerged the areas.

Places such as Ggaba and Port Bell markets have all been submerged by water and traders have resorted to selling food and other items on the road that leads to the markets. Similarly, happening places such as Ggaba Beach, K.K Beach, Miami Beach have been swallowed by water. Others that have been affected are Ggaba Water Works offices, Serena- Kigo Hotel, Speke Resort Hotel- Munyonyo, and several others surrounding the great water body.

The question on most people’s minds when they see a flooded market, homes and businesses on the shores of Lake Victoria is whether the beaches, landing sites, and some islands they have known all their life will resurface.

Standing at the flooded part of Ggaba landing site is Kassim Katende, the chairperson of the fishermen at Ggaba.

“Most of the community members here depend on fishing, but right now we do not have fish because the lake is full of water and security forces are guarding the waters,” lamented Katende.

Sarah Kaine, a businesswoman who sells food items at Gaba, expresses her fears for the dying business because of the flooding of the area.

""Our customers have disappeared and we are worried that we may not be able to continue with our business again. My selling point has been flooded and I have no other option but to wait until it dries up,” narrates Kaine in agony.

Mzee Sulaiman Kassujja a trader dealing in fish selling at the same landing site for the past 25 years narrates that, “we who sell fish are affected so much because fishermen no longer catch good fish and in large quantities. The few fish caught are very expensive.”

According to Sulaiman, the rise in the price of the fish has made their customers to opt for other substitutes such as meat and chicken. He further noted that the rise is also as a result of the challenge in accessing the catch from the lake and increase in costs as a result of lockdown.

Currently, a big tilapia goes for UGX 35,000 ($9.21), up from UGX 20,000 ($5.26), an initial price before the disaster outbreak.

Hamis Gamwero, the LC1 for Ggaba landing site and has lived in Ggaba for four decades said, “Since I came here in 1986, I have never seen this kind of flood. The people, especially traders are at a high risk of contracting other diseases, and it is worse that we have coronavirus.”

Kamadha Kakooza, the Katoogo Village, chairperson, told us that at least 500 families have already left the place and hundreds, which have been rendered homeless, have been accommodated in other peoples’ homes that are yet to be invaded by the overflowing water.

“When the water levels started rising, those who could, chose to vacate the area. Some [who had nowhere to go] remained. What we did was to talk to those who are yet to be affected to at least accommodate those affected for some time,” he said.

Meanwhile, at Port Bell in Luzira, which is also a rail link and a railroad ferry wharf used for International traffic across Lake Victoria to Tanzania and Kenya, the story is not different. The water has entered into houses of the dwellers and forced them to seek refuge somewhere else.

“People are trying to desilt the water by pouring sand but the environment authorities are against it,” said Teopista Nankinga, a women’s leader at Port Bell.

Markets and settlements near the Lake have severely been affected and homes submerged by the flooding water. The disaster has also been recorded at the same time when the country is under lockdown in March because of COVID-19. This means that the affected people are left with a few options for survival since most of them could not travel to their villages.

Many of these businesses and government installations were located outside the 200 perimeter buffer zone recommended by the government. Their destruction raises tough questions about the level of government planning. If the 200 meter perimeter buffer zone recommended by the government is not safe, what is safe? Suppose businesses move farther away from the expanded lake shore, what happens when the lake shore eventually recedes?

The continued downpour and flooding has had negative impacts on the people and property downstream of Lake Victoria during the time when the country and region at large is on a lockdown, as a means of controlling the potential spread of coronavirus.

Environment experts warn that the flooding of the lake tributaries has been accelerated by environmental degradation, which has caused a disruption of the water bodies.

Dr. Daniel Babikwa, the District Support Coordinator at the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), said that the communities encroached on the shores of the Lake, thus disturbing nature.

“Unfortunately, many people encroached on the shoreline and what you see now are the results of the impact,” said Babikwa.

On the same note, Beatrice Anywar, the Uganda State Minister for Environment, told us that most of the structures including Beaches set up around the Lake were illegal.

The Minister revealed that the government is encouraging voluntary migration of the settlement away from the endangered zones of the lake shores, and warned that action will be taken against those who will not leave.

In the same call, Dr. Tom Okurut, the Executive Director for NEMA, advises the affected residents to vacate the natural habitats lest they will be forcefully evicted.

A statement issued by the Ministry of Water and Environment on 1st May, stated that the Lake Victoria water level continues to rise to critical levels despite increased releases due to the increasing inflows and heavy rains in Lake Victoria Basin. At the same time, the Rivers discharging into Lake Victoria from upstream countries have uncontrollably more than doubled their inflows.

The current water levels that started last October (2019), have consistently continued to rise up from 12:00 meters to the current 13:32 meters, the second highest increase recorded since 1964, when the water level rose to 13:46 meters.

What Caused the Rise of Water Level?

Sam Cheptoris, Uganda’s Minister for Water and Environment, explained that Lake Victoria has over 23 rivers flowing into it from the three East African Countries that include Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

According to the Minister, when it rains, an increase in the waters from those rivers results into the direct increase in the water they pour into the largest freshwater lake in the continent.

“Some of these rivers originate from as far as Rwanda and Burundi: therefore, when it rains in those countries, water finds its ways into Lake Victoria,” explained the Minister.

Mr Cheptoris further noted that, “a number of areas around lakes and rivers have been identified as high flood risk areas and essential features such as schools, health facilities and places of worship are at risk.”

Is the Government Taking Any Measures?

In a communication by Minister Cheptoris, the government has put into place a number of measures to help address the problems of the rising water levels and associated floods.

Government has since instituted measures to immediately get water out of Lave Victoria through increased releases at Jinja which is now at the rate of 2200 cubic meters per second, up from the rate of 1000 cubic meters per second in October 2019.

A national Response team comprising the Ministry of Works and Transport, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, Ministry of Defense and Veteran Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries and, Ministry of Water and Environment. The team has ready equipment and Machinery to carry out surveillance and monitoring of the movement of the floating islands and removed those that are considered a threat to the electricity power generation.

The Inter-Ministerial committee has also been set up, under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister, comprising 14 Ministries and seven Agencies to implement Government response to the disaster.

In line to that, a multi-sectoral Technical Task team chaired by the Ministry of Water and Environment provides support to the Inter-Ministerial Committee and has already started on emergency works on: ensuring safety of Hydropower dams, protection of lives and, monitoring and surveillance of water resources and floating islands.

At the time of compiling this report, the lockdown in the country was preventing people from using public means of transport, some businesses such as salons, bars and open access markets were restricted from operation- and potentially putting the survival of the affected people at stake.

Although the number of COVID-19 infections have reached more than 1000, Uganda has continued to register almost 100% recoveries by July, 2020.

Lake Victoria which is shared by three countries; Tanzania (49%), Uganda (45%), and Kenya (6%), hit 1,134.38 metres above mean sea level (mamsl) on May 07. That is a difference of about 1.32 meters and is significant because Lake Victoria is a very shallow lake, especially on the Ugandan side where it averages a depth of just 40 meters.

Lake Victoria lies on an average elevation of 3,720 feet (1,134 meters) above sea level. Kampala is just 1,200 meters above sea level, a difference of about 70 meters. Ggaba, which is 60 meters above at 1,140 meters above sea level, is already inundated.

If the current rate of rise in water levels were to continue, the State House in Entebbe, and Parliament of Uganda in Kampala itself could easily find itself submerged.

Last Monday, Water and Environment was one of the ministries that presented their performance in the implementation of the 2016 NRM manifesto.

The ministry’s director for water resources management, Dr Florence Grace Odongo, revealed that the water levels on Lake Victoria have risen to 13.4 metres short of 8cm to reach last year’s levels and yet the rainy season has just started. People living on river banks and lake shores were, therefore, warned to vacate the areas before floods begin to rage.

Such warnings have become an annual repetition albeit in good faith as they are meant to avoid loss of lives and property.

Unfortunately, they are usually taken lightly by the audience for whom they are intended.

But then again, these people rightly referred to as encroachers would not even be there in the first place if environment laws were observed. Clearly, there seems to a problem when it comes to implementation of laws.

In a Daily Monitor story of May 14 titled, “Govt issues flood alerts, tells lakeside residents to vacate”, Mr Sam Cheptoris, the minister of Water and Environment, says one of the reasons they have not been able to contain encroachment and destruction of forests and wetlands is because of low enforcement of laws which is exacerbated by the fact that there are few enforcement officers under the environment protection police unit.

In a statement on the rising water levels of Lake Victoria and the Nile system last year in May, Mr Cheptoris directed that people living within the protection zones of wetlands, lakes, rivers, and forest reserves vacate with immediate effect.

He said the ministry was working with the Ministry of Local Government and other government agencies to evict people living within 100 metres of river banks, 30 metres of wetlands and 200 metres of lake shores, and in forest reserves.

He said the respective government offices, from the central to local levels, up to the sub-county and parish levels, has been informed about the directive and requested to take the required actions with immediate effect.

Was there an attempt to implement these directives in spite of the shortage of enforcement officers? What action is being taken against encroachers and how is government making sure that they do not settle in those areas again? How can the communities near the said areas be involved in stopping encroachment?

It would be prudent to present an audit of whether these directives were successfully implemented and if not, what can be done this time to get a better results.

This way, we can avoid repetitions of the same directives year after year with no lasting solutions.

HOIMA- As the country gears up for the reopening of schools for finalists, pupils of Primary Seven at Toonya Primary School in Buseruka sub-county, Hoima district, remain in uncertainty after their school was cut off by floods from Lake Albert.

The floods, which began in early April, have moved inland by over a kilometre from the shore, paralysing the activities of the fishing community on several landing sites.Henry Katalibabo, the Toonya A LCI chairperson, told New Vision that 222 houses, accommodating 1,068 people, have been affecteVd.

""The water levels keep rising. We are worried of the likely destruction of our homes,"" he said. Katalibabo said some pupils will be required to board canoes twice before accessing the area designated to accommodate them.

Moses Kyaligonza, the Toonya Primary School headteacher, said when schools were closed in March, they had 450 pupils with 38 in Primary Seven. Kyaligonza said it would be better to have these children accommodated in one place for their safety because trekking daily from their homes is risky.

Accommodation for teachers is also a big challenge because the flooded school had eight staff quarters. The houses that would have been rented by the teachers have also been affected by floods.

Dr Fredrick Byenume, the Hoima district health inspector, said waterborne diseases such as cholera and dysentery are likely to result from the floods.

""There is no doubt that the water is contaminated with faecal matter because all the pit latrines are filled up by water,"" Byenume said. He said they are planning to distribute chlorine tablets to purify the water as one way of preventing waterborne diseases.Byenume appealed to the public to desist from open defecation to avoid further contamination of the water.He said both the school and Toonya Health Centre III have been declared unfit for human use.

Reports say the overflow of two rivers in western Uganda exacerbated the situation, causing buildings to submerge. A major hospital in western Kasese had partly been submerged according to the Red cross.

Betty Mbambu, flood victim spoke to the media: “I had just bought a plot. The flood came and washed away my property, cupboards, mattresses. Right now, we are here trying to see what things of ours we can dig out.

“We woke up and business and the property were destroyed. Right now we are trying to find the remaining properties (items) that could been buried in our house.”

The rains also led to damage of infrastructure, including roads, bridges and several farms were washed away.

In a related development in East Africa, floods have killed 65 people in Rwanda on Thursday and nearly 200 in Kenya last month.

Kasese floods death toll now 11 – Relief Web

The district and Uganda Red Cross authorities said the deceased included two students, and Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF) soldier, Lothorach Lokwang, attached to the Bwera-based Mountain Brigade.

At least 11 people have been confirmed dead following the new wave of floods that hit the Uganda-DR Congo border district Kasese on Thursday.

Nine of the deaths occurred in Kitholhu sub-county while the other two were killed in Mpondwe-Lhubiriha town council when floods washed them into River Lhubiriha, which burst its banks.

Also River Thako in the Town Council flooded.

The floods were as a result of River Lhubiriha, which borders Uganda and DR Congo along Kitholhu sub-county, in Bukonzo West Constituency. It burst its banks following the overnight torrential rains in Mt Rwenzori.

Uganda is known as the “Pearl of Africa” because of its stunning natural beauty and biodiversity. Its lush vegetation is associated with regular tropical rainfall, but the East African nation is now struggling to deal with more frequent and intense rains that are causing landslides.

Landslides can dump millions of tons of muddy debris in Uganda’s rivers and streams, said Mary Goretti Kitutu, Uganda’s minister of energy and mineral development and an expert on geology and landslides. Such debris can dam rivers, flood surrounding areas, and cause damage to infrastructure.

“The main landslide types [in Uganda] are debris slumps, which occur on concave slopes where water concentrates. Slopes facing northeast are most prone to landslides, which coincide with the dominant rainfall direction,” Kitutu said.

The region’s soil profile is significant, she continued, explaining that “topsoils have a high infiltration rate, which allows fast flow of water into the deeper, clay-rich horizons—promoting water stagnation and causing slope failure.”

Landslide Losses

Although Uganda has always experienced some loss of life due to landslides, the number of casualties has increased this century.

Over the past 25 years, catastrophic landslides have regularly hit the foothills of Mount Elgon, for instance, which straddles the border between eastern Uganda and Kenya. The region’s most devastating landslide swept the slopes in 2010. Although more than 300 people are thought to have perished, only about 100 bodies were recovered. Thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed.

In 2012, a landslide followed 2 days of heavy rains in the same area. At least 18 people were killed, and 15 houses were destroyed. In December 2019, five people died in mudslides following heavy rainfall, 150 houses were destroyed, and the crops of smallholder farmers were swept away.

The most obvious trigger for Uganda’s slump landslides is rainfall. Rainfall events of low intensity but long duration are thought to be the most disastrous, a pattern that is well known among Ugandan farmers.

Callist Tindimugaya, commissioner for water resources planning and regulation in Uganda’s Ministry of Water and Environment, attributed the increase in rainfall to changing climate patterns and rapid loss of forest cover due to trees being cut down to be used as fuel. Tindimugaya said climate change is likely to increase average temperatures in Uganda by up to 1.5°C in the next 20 years and by up to 4.3°C by the 2080s.

“Changes in rainfall patterns and total annual rainfall amounts are also expected,” he added, “but these are less certain than changes in temperature.”

“Rain Has Become My Enemy”

“Rain has become my enemy. When it rains, my heart sinks.” “Rain has become my enemy. When it rains, my heart sinks,” said Gerald Masaba, a coffee farmer in the Bududa District in eastern Uganda.

Masaba said many forests in the area have been turned into farms. The thin topsoil of converted forest often fails to retain water during heavy downpours, increasing the farm’s vulnerability to flood. In addition, terraced agriculture is not popular among farmers “because they believe terraces promote water infiltration, which triggers landslides,” Kitutu added.

Clovis Kabaseke, however, said farmers can be trained on how to successfully engage in terraced agriculture. Kabaseke is a lecturer and researcher in the School of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences at Mountains of the Moon University in Uganda.

Kabaseke said the agricultural method can be effective in maximizing arable land area in variable terrains and reducing soil erosion and water loss, but farmers need to be taught the most effective practices.

Displaced Communities

Alfred Okidi, the permanent secretary in Uganda’s Ministry of Water and Environment, said that in 2020, more than 850 people were permanently displaced by mudslides.

With assistance from partners such as the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Ugandan government was able to safely relocate these displaced people. Okidi said IOM and CERF provided $818,000 in emergency relief.

Musa Ecweru, the state minister for relief and disaster preparedness in the Ugandan cabinet, was hopeful that the relocation would ultimately help build communities and economies. “The landslide victims were settled in Kiryandongo District,” he said, “where each household was given land to farm so that they can move on with their new lives.”

Rosemary Nandudu, however, says the transition will not be easy. Nandudu was relocated from the wet, fertile ecosystem of eastern Uganda to the drier one of the western Kiryandongo District and said the land provided by the government is not fertile. “It has been hard for us to adjust to a dry land, when most crops we used to know and grow cannot grow there,” she said.

Margaret Kemigisa, who grows tea in the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains in western Uganda, said farmers who formerly grew crops such as beans, millet, and bananas have switched to tea. Tea requires heavy seasonal rainfall and is grown at altitudes that are less vulnerable to debris slumps.

“Farmers from Bushenyi, Kanungu, Mityana, Mbale, and Mukono—which are hilly—have been trained to grow tea, which can also be grown in greenhouses provided the soils are acidic,” Kemigisa said.

According to Nandudu, relocated communities also face lifestyle changes. They are unable to keep cattle in the new area and have to buy food, which was not the case in their former self-sufficient community.

Joseph Mafabi, who was relocated to Kiryandongo, had to find a new job in a refugee settlement to make ends meet. “I would have wanted to go back to the Elgon region, but the government is telling us that it is not safe to go back,” he said.

What Is Being Done

Community groups, government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations are working to reduce the frequency of landslides in Uganda, mostly by planting trees in vulnerable areas. In one settlement, a group of more than 100 teenagers began their own tree planting campaign to reduce the chance of future landslides.

Tom Obong Okello, executive director of Uganda’s National Forestry Authority (NFA), said the NFA has started planting trees on the slopes of Elgon to control soil erosion. “We are restoring the lost vegetation and trees to mitigate landslides in the area,” he said.

Trees for the Future, an international nonprofit organization, says it has planted more than 16 million trees in Uganda to help farmers restore their land and mitigate landslides.

David Duli, country director of World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Uganda, said WWF Uganda has helped organize community groups to reforest areas that have been the most affected by landslides. “Forests play a significant role in national development through their contribution to the ecological balance, energy, and industrial activities.…We have formed community groups to replant trees in areas that were affected by landslides, but we also wanted the community to own these initiatives,” Duli said.

The rising water levels of River Nile, which started in June, have left Obongi Landing Site and the neighbouring Obongi Town Council submerged.

By last Thursday, floods had submerged nearly half of Obongi Town, filling more than 100 homes, the town's main mosque, shops and primary schools.

The water has also cut off the road connecting Obongi to Moyo and Adjumani districts.

""Livestock such as cows, goats and chicken have died in the floods while very many remain stranded,"" Mr Taban Data, the Adjumani Resident District Commissioner (RDC), said at the weekend.

Area leaders and residents say they last experienced such flooding in 1964 when the then Obongi County suffered severe flooding, which submerged up to five kilometres of land from the original banks of River Nile.

The district authorities have warned of a potential rise in the water levels and asked residents in the low-lying areas to vacate.

""The water is claiming where exactly it used to be some years back and we have asked residents to leave that area because no one knows if the water levels may recede soon since the floods have persisted for long now,"" Mr Goffin Gore, the Obongi RDC, said at the weekend.

He added that people started settling on the banks of River Nile that are demarcated as wetlands without authorisation.

According to the district disaster management committee, 118 homesteads with nearly 380 people have been displaced by the floods.

Mr Gore said the district disaster management committee has petitioned the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), seeking its intervention. According to him, flood victims lack basic necessities such as food, clean water and accommodation.

Cholera Oral Vaccination 2020

Ministry of Health will next month embark on Cholera vaccination in flood-prone areas following reports of anticipated heavy rains.



Oral Cholera Vaccine is used as part of the Ministry of Health’s Integrated Cholera prevention and control strategy. The others include the provision of safe water, improved sanitation, and high-quality case management.



Dr Joyce Moriku, the State Minister for Primary Health Care, says that the government has imported additional 1 Million vaccines which will be rolled out in May to complete vaccination of those that had earlier received the first dose last year 2020.



//Cue in: “In November 2020…



Cue out: districts as mentions.”//



According to Moriku, the flood-prone districts include Kasese, Busia, Namayingo, Obongi, Madi-Okolo, Ntoroko targeting to reach between 800,000 and one million people. These received the first dose and have been considered high-risk areas to flood reports during the rainy season.



During the floods, the districts face threats of an outbreak of cholera and other water-borne diseases. In Kasese district, River Nyamwamba bursts its banks displacing several people and washing away latrines. The residents also deposit human waste in polythene bags and dump it in the flowing water.



Dr Godfrey Bwire, the Assistant Commissioner of Public Health Emergency, urged the public to also follow preventive guidelines like regular hand washing, opening up drainage channels, drinking boiled water and clearing bushes around their homes.



//Cue in: “To open the…

In September 2018, the government launched a national cholera vaccination campaign that aimed to vaccinate over one million people in cholera prone areas.



Cholera is an infection caused by bacteria and affects the intestines. The main symptoms are watery diarrhoea and vomiting. This may result in dehydration and severe cases of greyish-bluish skin. Transmission occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the faeces of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms.

Gardens, roads, and homes in five sub-counties of Dokolo district have been submerged by the rising water levels of Lake Kwania, making over a thousand families homeless.

The people affected have moved to higher grounds as the devastating floods continue to wreak havoc in the district.

Olga Hope Eriong, a resident of Acungapenyi, Kachung parish in Agwata sub-county says the community whose homes have been submerged by floods is experiencing problems of lack of food and shelter.

She says there is a scarcity of building materials, so they are facing difficulties in constructing new houses.

Middy Amek, a mother of four, whose home was affected says the water level started rising last year and since then, it has covered more than 700 metres inland towards her home.

""I have to leave this place but it's not easy, due to lack of building materials,"" she said.

Karina Akite, a resident of the place says she last witnessed such flooding in 1962 but that time, there was much rain.

The ceremonial ground near her home is all flooded. Dokolo RDC Lawrence Egole said they recently used the ground during a funeral.

Kuranimo Dai, another resident said their homes are greatly affected.

Dai said at night, it's very cold, there're many mosquitoes and snakes. He also said the flood water smells bad.

Nelson Okello, a youthful retail trader in the village said he is being forced out of his home by the flood.

Ronny Opio Okodi, a resident in the area said over 490 houses have been affected by the water in the village. He is appealing for emergency assistance to enable them to relocate to high land.

Ongom Apita, 66, says floods have destroyed his citrus farm.

""Even my fish pond and bananas that NAADS gave me were destroyed,"" he said.

Agwata sub-county LC3 Chairperson Geofrey Ojungu says most of the people in nine villages, are affected by the water from the lake Kwania.

""We are planning to relocate them to schools and sub-county headquarter's land,"" he said.

The district chairperson Fredrick Odongo says the floods have affected the sub-counties of Agwata, Adok, Kwera, Adeknino, Okwongdul, and Kangai.

""Last week we went to the sub-counties of Kwera, Adeknino, and Okwongodul and found a number of homes destroyed, gardens flooded, and roads destroyed,"" Odongo said.

He said the road network in the district has been greatly affected and they have to be reconstructed when the flood subsides.

He said in Agwata, where they visited on Monday, they found a similar situation.

""A number of farms and homes have been destroyed,"" Odongo said.

He said they wrote to the office of the Prime Minister who sent a consignment of relief items including 15, 000kg of maize flour, 5000kg of beans, and 50 bundles of tarpaulin.

Odongo added that they have not received 300 pieces of blankets as indicated in a letter dated May 28, 2020, signed by Rose Nakabugo on behalf of the Permanent Secretary.

Days of torrential rains have triggered devastating floods that have caused four major rivers to burst their banks, forcing thousands from their homes and destroying roads, bridges and public buildings.

Laura Beutler, Technical Coordinator for Malteser International in Uganda, said: ""The largest hospital in Kasese has had to be evacuated, leaving people there without much-needed medical care. We will be sending eight ambulances and a medical team in support of health facilities in the district. A lack of urgent medical care would be catastrophic, especially under the present circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic.”

The floodwaters have damaged homes, latrines and water sources in Kasese district. Some 30,000 people are now homeless. “This disaster could have major implications for the COVID-19 response in the area,” said Beutler. “Those displaced have been forced to seek refuge in makeshift shelters where social distancing is practically impossible. The risk of COVID-19 spreading there is now high. To reduce the risk of infection, Malteser International will be providing daily access to clean water for up to 1,000 people affected by the flooding. We will also be working with our partners to provide information on safety measures against the novel coronavirus.”

Since late April, exceptional heavy seasonal rains have resulted in widespread across East Africa, killing nearly 300 people and causing a heavy loss of property. The disaster is compounding the risks to human health and food security from the COVID-19 pandemic and the worst locust infestation in decades.

For the past few days, it has been raining in many parts of the country and as is the unfortunate norm, whenever it rains, many areas including roads flood and are rendered impassable not to mention the destruction of property and sometimes lives. While we might not have control over the rain, we surely should be able to control the after effects.

Year after year, the country grapples with the problem of rain floods which are mainly caused by poor drainage systems, disregard of environmental guidelines such as erecting buildings in swampy areas that are prone to floods, poor garbage disposal which usually blocks drainage systems, in turn hindering passage of water, among others.

The Kampala Capital City Authority 2017 Kampala drainage master plan cites poor design and construction of drains, poor inter connectivity of drains, limited sensitisation of the public, unplanned settlements and poor enforcement mechanisms and mindsets of the people as some of the issues that affect drainage.

In Kampala for instance, the same areas keep flooding every time it rains heavily even for just a few hours, causing an aftermath of traffic jam and in unfortunate circumstances, accidents where people and vehicles are washed away by the floods.

Some of these areas include Industrial Area, where motorists can be seen daring the raging filthy water that takes over road space turning them into mini rivers. Since this is a recurring problem and is almost expected every year, it should be continually planned for and a lasting solution found.

The areas in different parts of the country that are prone to flooding should be identified before the rains start and a plan to prevent the effects of flooding be devised.

We shouldn’t have to keep crying foul about the same problem year in, year out as if it is impossible to solve. We could start with simple steps such as ensuring that man hole covers are intact as these have also been a death trap, especially when rain floods occur.

Then there’s the emphasis on the state of the drainage system. With well-planned and constructed drainage systems, we can alleviate floods.

As has been suggested before by many concerned and expert parties, these systems must undergo regular maintenance which includes unclogging and revaluating their ability and effectiveness to serve their purpose as the water volumes may keep increasing.

People living in flooded areas or water lodged conditions are at risk of suffering from waterborne diseases like diarrhoea, dysentery, cholera, etc.

KALAKI - Rising water levels on Lake Kyoga have ravaged three sub-counties in Kalaki district, leaving over 1,400 people helpless.

Scores of residents have fled their homes for safety. Some stay with relatives, while others have rented small units in trading centres.

The LC1 chairperson of Akura village in Kakure sub-county, Kalaki district, Charles Ochung, said the water levels started rising five months ago, but residents did not take it seriously.

Ochung said the most affected sub-counties are Kalaki, Bululu and Kakure.

Florence Engoru, a resident of Akura village, said the rising waters have paralysed transport since roads have been cut off.

Engoru said children in candidate classes from the affected sub-counties were finding it hard to access schools and are worried about how they will sit their examinations.

Engoru said she realised earlier that water levels were going up and left the village before the situation could get worse.

Those who remained behind are now crying out for assistance to be evacuated as more homes get submerged.

Another resident, Rogers Ajaro, said pregnant mothers are finding it hard to access antenatal services and the nearby areas have started reporting cases of waterborne diseases.","Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['started', 'kalaki', 'subcounties', 'waterborne', 'rising', 'resident', 'residents', 'floods', 'uganda', 'water', 'levels', 'ravaged', 'village']",

• The June to September 2020 seasonal rains over the northern and western sector of the region were above average across much of the region. Devastating floods occurred at the peak of the rainfall season, affecting over 2.5 million people and causing significant crop damage in riverine areas in Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, Ethiopia,

Somalia, Uganda, and Kenya.

• Crop losses were significant in several riverine areas, including along the Awash River in Ethiopia, the While and Blue Nile Rivers in South Sudan and Sudan, and the Juba and Shabelle Rivers in Somalia.

Outside of flood-affected areas, the seasonal rains were generally beneficial for crop and livestock production, water availability, and hydro-power generation across East Africa. The water-levels in major lakes, rivers, and dams are among the highest on record, especially in the Lake Victoria basin, major Rift Valley lakes, and White and Blue Nile Rivers.

• Desert locust swarms continue to form, and breeding is underway in Ethiopia, north-central Somalia, Yemen, and eastern Sudan. The situation in Ethiopia is of high concern, where government and other sources report significant damage to meher crops in Amhara, Tigray, and Oromia regions.

• Rangeland resources and livestock production conditions are exceptionally above average across most pastoral and agropastoral regions of East Africa due to two consecutive rainfall seasons of above average rainfall performance since late 2019. However, atypically high disease prevalence and livestock deaths are reported in South Sudan due to severe floods in 2019 and 2020.

• The 1-2 weeks rainfall outlook depicts the gradual southward shift of the tropical rainfall system from the northern to equatorial sectors. This marks a timely onset of the seasonal rains in bimodal South Sudan and Uganda, while the rains will gradually subside and reduce the risk of associated flooding in Sudan, unimodal South Sudan, Yemen, and Ethiopia. However, much of eastern Horn is expected to remain sunny and dry, with a delayed and erratic onset of the short/deyr rains in eastern Ethiopia and southern Somalia.","Sat, 10 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539740-EAST_AFRICA_Seasonal_Monitor_2020_09_06_final.png?itok=kRTluo5N,"['africa', 'significant', 'south', 'seasonal', 'rainfall', 'livestock', 'rivers', '2020', 'east', 'yemen', 'monitor', 'ethiopia', 'sudan', 'rains', 'world']",

NAKASONGOLA- Flash floods have submerged a section of the Lwampanga Health Centre IV in Nakasongola District, paralysing normal operations at the maternity unit.

Currently, expectant mothers are unable to access antenatal services at the medical centre.

The floods have displaced about 717 people in the district and many of them are camping at schools and churches.

Nakasongola District Health Officer, Dr Agaba Byamukama, said at the weekend that water from the flooding Lake Kyoga has forced administrators of the health centre to temporarily shift particular services antenatal services to a safer area.

“The floods have partly inconvenienced normal service delivery because several families have been displaced and forced to seek shelter in areas that are far from the health centre,” Dr Agaba said.

He said that sanitation facilities like pit-latrines at the health facility have been flooded which could trigger water-borne diseases.","Mon, 06 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['health', 'hundreds', 'forced', 'nakasongola', 'dr', 'normal', 'district', 'services', 'displaced', 'floods', 'uganda', 'displace', 'centre', 'antenatal']",

Respective National Societies, with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), are working to respond to each of these disasters through different means. Some have Disaster Relief Emergency Funds (DREFs) or Emergency Appeals (EAs) launched, and others may require additional support in the future.

The situation

Within a month (August to September) 2020, more than 1.21 million people in 12 different countries have been affected by floods across Africa and many other countries are currently experiencing more widespread rainfall than usual in the long rain season leading to transboundary flooding in several areas. Countries most affected by floods during the last five weeks are; Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Kenya, Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Mali. More countries are in trajectories of being affected by floods during the monsoon season which will continue till November. A brief overview of the situation is given below:

In Sudan, 17 of the country's 18 states have been affected, with North Darfur, Sennar, West Ordofan, and Kassala being the worst affected. More than 0.5 million people have been affected and 99 people have lost their lives and over 100,000 houses have been damaged. Thirty-four (34) schools and 2,671 health facilities have also been damaged. It has also been stated that the magnitude of rain and floods this year exceeds the 1988 and 1946 floods. The affected families are seeking shelter with relatives and host communities. Following a meeting with the Council of Ministers, the Security and Defence Council in Sudan has declared a state of emergency for three months in the whole country and formation of a higher committee to mitigate the effects of the floods

In South Sudan, over 600,000 people were displaced by floods according to the United Nations (UN). Flooding along the White Nile has affected four counties in six states since July 2020. Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding in vast areas and settlements along the White Nile in the center of the country, with the states of Jonglei and Lakes being the worst affected. According to a Rapid Needs Assessment, priorities include water, purification tablets, plastic sheeting for temporary shelter, mosquito nets, fishing kits, and medicines for Malaria, Diarrhea and other waterborne diseases

In Kenya, rains led to the displacement of over 100,000 people and 194 people lost their lives. In Ethiopia, rains affected over 200,000 people and caused 8 deaths. Flooding in Uganda saw 5,000 people displaced and 6 deaths with 3,800 people on the Lake Islands in Mayuga District evacuated due to an increased water level in Lake Victoria.

According to the Niger Red Cross Society and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), in Niger, more than 88,000 people have been affected by floods in 8 regions of Niger – Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Niamey, Tahoua, Tillaberi and Zinder – with 33 deaths and 9,568 houses collapsed. Many people have been displaced and had to seek refuge in schools and host families.

In Chad, almost 120,000 people have been displaced by floods during the August 2020 rains. According to a report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 32,000 of those displaced were in N’Djamena, where 10 people lost their lives. Previously, 1,000 homes on the Maingama Site were damaged, forcing 430 households to flee their destroyed homes.

The Bunyoro Kitara Kingdom has called for the immediate relocation of all persons who were displaced by floods in the districts of Buliisa, Hoima, Kagadi and Kikuube.



More than 2000 homes have been submerged by floods from the rising water levels of Lake Albert in the four districts over the last nine months. Records show that up t0 38,000 people were displaced affected in Buliisa district alone, especially in the areas of Wanseko, Katanga, Kawaibanda, Butiaba, Boma, Kigangaizi, Tugombili and Walukuba.



Also affected are the areas of Bugoigo, Kamagongoro, Kigungu, Serule, Piida, Waisoki, Triangle and Magali in Butiaba Sub-county, Kabolwa and Kigoya landing sites in Kigoya sub-county. In Kagadi district, the floods have swept through the areas of Kabukanga, Rwebigongoro, Nkuse and Ndaiga.



Those affected in Hoima are Tonya, Kijangi, Kaiso, Rwentali, Hoimo, Fofo, Mbegu, Waaki and Kiryamboga among others, while the affected areas in Kikuube include Nkondo, Sebigoro, Ususa, Senjojo, Wangjok, Busiki and Nsonga.



Andrew Byakutaga, the Bunyoro Kitara Kingdom Prime Minister says the situation has gone out of hand, and that the government needs to intervene and save the lives of people that are now at risk. The flood victims are currently occupying churches and schools, whole others are sleeping in the cold.

Cue out…are having challenges.”//



Francis Kazini, the Kikuube LCV Chairperson wonders why the government has not taken appropriate action to have the flood victims relocated.



In August, The Bunyoro Kitara Kingdom petitioned the government to immediately extend relief food to thousands of people affected by floods in the region. The petition followed an assessment of the destruction undertaken across the various landing sites by Kingdom officials led by Byakutaga.","Wed, 11 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://ugandaradionetwork.net/a/helpers/image.php?fileId=234960&m=0&w=960&h=960,"['radionetwork', 'immediate', 'kitara', 'areas', 'bunyoro', 'victims', 'relocation', 'demands', 'landing', 'district', 'affected', 'floods', 'uganda', 'flood', 'wanseko', 'districts', 'buliisa', 'kingdom']",

• The March to May (MAM) rainfall period was one of the wettest the region has seen since 1981 (Figure 1), following an already record wet 2019 October to December (OND) rainfall period.

• The early onset of rains and above-average rainfall since February promoted land preparation and planting activities for the MAM season across Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, along with the Belg season in Ethiopia.

• However, the abundant rains have also caused localized flooding, mudslides, flashfloods, and river overflows over the past months causing casualties, population displacement, infrastructure damage, and crop damage in parts of Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and Yemen.

• Cropping conditions remain generally favourable as rains are expected to be beneficial to planting and crop development across much of the region; however, localized losses and crop damage are expected in areas worst affected by flooding (Figure 2).

• Abundant rains have also promoted the breeding and development of desert locusts and protracted the outbreak across the region, which continues to pose a significant threat to main season crops.

• Above-average rainfall is expected to continue across much of the region through May which will increase the flood risk across many areas and further protract the desert locust outbreak (See May Outlook Pg. 8).","Tue, 19 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1518254-Special_Report_East_Africa_202005.png?itok=2ce-Vf7E,"['africa', 'crop', 'rainfall', 'east', 'uganda', 'updated', 'flood', '2020', 'rains', 'tanzania', 'special', 'expected', 'season', 'report', 'damage', 'region', 'agriculture', 'impacts', 'somalia']",

Torrential rains have triggered devastating floods and landslides across East Africa in recent weeks, aggravating an already challenging situation as countries in the region battle the coronavirus pandemic.

The destruction caused by the heavy rainfall has killed hundreds of people in Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Rwanda and Ethiopia and has also forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.

This week, officials in Kenya and Rwanda said nearly 200 and 65 people had died in both countries, respectively, with floodwaters and mudslides destroying houses, washing away bridges and straining critical infrastructure.

On Saturday, Kenyan and Uganda suffered nationwide electricity outages, leaving tens of millions of people without power.

Health experts are worried about the implications of the flooding on the countries’ response to the coronavirus pandemic.

“This is compounding the COVID-19 response,” Kenya Health Ministry Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman said.

“The displaced people have been forced to congregate in makeshift camps with the risk of banding together exposing them to the possibility of contracting the virus.”

Floodwaters also recently swept away most parts of an entire small town in Somalia and swept away roads, bridges and a hospital in Uganda.

Heavy rains flooded areas around Mountain Rwenzori in western Uganda after Nyamwamba River burst its banks, forcing people to seek refuge in nearby schools and destroying roads and bridges, according to officials.

“What complicates the matter is that this is the era of COVID. People are expected to maintain social distance, but how do you maintain distance in such a situation?” Julius Mucunguzi, spokesman for the prime minister’s office, was quoted as saying by the Reuters News Agency.

One of the hospitals in the area, Kilembe, was also washed away despite being built on a raised bank and reinforced with sandbags.

“There are wards which were completely washed away. The mortuary was swept away. You wouldn’t know that once upon a time there was a mortuary there. The drugs and drug stores were washed away,” Mucunguzi said.

The Somali region in eastern Ethiopia has also been hard hit by the floods, with more than 100,000 people displaced, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

Meanwhile, an unspecified number of people were killed in the semi-autonomous Puntland region in Somalia when flash floods swept away most buildings in Qardho town, officials said.

The heavy rains stem from moisture dumped in the region by winds coming in from the Indian Ocean where temperatures have risen in recent months, said Chris Shisanya, a professor of climatology at Kenyatta University in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.

“This is a carry-over of what we had last year,” he said, referring to floods and landslides in the region.

The floods are coming as swarms of locusts are wreaking havoc across East Africa where millions of people struggle for food.

Billions of desert locusts have already chomped their way through Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti, Eritrea, Tanzania, Sudan and Uganda.

More than 23,000 residents of Obongi District in West Nile have been displaced from their homes as the sub-region experiences severe flooding caused by rising River Nile waters.

The rising water levels of River Nile, which started in June, have left Obongi Landing Site and the neighbouring Obongi Town Council submerged.

By last Thursday, floods had submerged nearly half of Obongi Town, filling more than 100 homes, the town’s main mosque, shops and primary schools.

The water has also cut off the road connecting Obongi to Moyo and Adjumani districts.

“Livestock such as cows, goats and chicken have died in the floods while very many remain stranded,” Mr Taban Data, the Adjumani Resident District Commissioner (RDC), said at the weekend.

Area leaders and residents say they last experienced such flooding in 1964 when the then Obongi County suffered severe flooding, which submerged up to five kilometres of land from the original banks of River Nile.

The district authorities have warned of a potential rise in the water levels and asked residents in the low-lying areas to vacate.

“The water is claiming where exactly it used to be some years back and we have asked residents to leave that area because no one knows if the water levels may recede soon since the floods have persisted for long now,” Mr Goffin Gore, the Obongi RDC, said at the weekend.

He added that people started settling on the banks of River Nile that are demarcated as wetlands without authorisation.

According to the district disaster management committee, 118 homesteads with nearly 380 people have been displaced by the floods.

Mr Gore said the district disaster management committee has petitioned the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), seeking its intervention. According to him, flood victims lack basic necessities such as food, clean water and accommodation.

Appeal

Ms Lilly Kareyo, the Obongi District chairperson, said the Shs13m supplementary budget that the district disaster committee approved to help the affected communities cannot cause an impact.

Liri Trading Centre, Namisambya Town East and Kilamin village neighbouring Obongi Landing Site as well as parts of Palorinya refugee settlement camp have been affected by the floods.

Data from the Adjumani District disaster management committee indicates that Okusijoni and Arinyapi sub-counties are worst hit while thousands of residents in Pakele and Dzaipi sub-counties struggle to cope with the floods after Tete River that drains into the Nile River burst its banks.

Two of its biggest plants, the 180-megawatt Nalubaale and 200-megawatt Kiira plants outside Jinga, are being battered by rising flood waters and floating papyrus.

On April 14, a floating mass of papyrus mats (used across Lake Victoria and now cast afloat like islands) crunched into the dam wall. Bits of papyrus were sucked into the turbines. The country was plunged into a blackout as around 20% of the grid’s capacity suddenly went offline.

The story of that moment started six months earlier, in October, when it started raining in Uganda. It hasn’t stopped since. Lake Victoria’s levels have risen by 1.3m and are just 8cm away from their highest-ever level. Similar downpours filled the lake in the early 1960s and mid 1990s.

With 23 rivers feeding the lake and only one exit, past Jinga and into the Nile, Lake Victoria is perfect for hydropower. To help alleviate the pressure, the amount of water being released at Jinja has more than doubled.

But this isn’t just an issue of too much rain. Human expansion has played a large role.

In a press release detailing the government response, Uganda’s water and environment minister, Sam Cheptoris, said a loss of forest cover as well as encroachment on wetlands and river banks meant that there was more silt in the lake and fewer natural barriers to fast-flowing flood waters. Towns and roads also mean more cement and tar, so rainwater doesn’t soak into the ground and instead goes straight into rivers.

The higher water levels have meant jetties and landing sites being submerged, leading to a halt in ferries. The floating mats have also become a hazard to other shipping; so vital to local economies. Resorts, hotels and homes have been flooded. The flooding is also affecting Lake Kyoga, with flooding at a much lower level in Lake Albert.

Cheptoris noted that drinking water and sanitation systems have also been affected by the deluge, with a likely increase in water-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, malaria and bilharzia.

In response to the crisis, Cheptoris said the government will “remove” anyone encroaching on water bodies and forests. Chiefs who have not taken “action against encroachers” will also be dismissed.

Practically, this affects people within 100m of river banks, 30m of wetlands and 200m of lake shores and forest reserves.","Wed, 06 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://bucket.mg.co.za/wp-media/2019/03/5deeba24-brisbane-besieged-by-onceinacentury-floods.jpeg,"['lake', 'started', 'cuts', 'power', 'floating', 'wetlands', 'river', 'response', 'uganda', 'water', 'flooding', 'victoria', 'waters']",

The combination of these disasters is not random, as the floods, lake level and locusts can all been linked to climate change.

Covid-19 is a zoonotic virus, which means it has been transmitted from animals to humans. The illegal global trade in wild animals (notably Pangolins, which are largely exported to China) has been directly damaging East Africa’s ecology for years and, even if not yet proven to be the case for Covid-19, such trade increases the chance of zoonotic pandemics.

Water levels of Lake Victoria have just reached the highest point ever in the 120 year record, displacing thousands and flooding infrastructure.

Other floods in the region have displaced tens of thousands of people and killed hundreds. The locust outbreak is the worst in 70 years and may, according to the UN, grow 400-fold by June.

Combined, these increase vulnerability and reduce the ability of the population to engage in social distancing and to practise basic hygiene just as the Covid-19 crisis hits East Africa.

The Lake Victoria basin is home to around 40 million people. The lake is the largest tropical lake in the world and its outflow is a major hydropower source.

The lake has major cities of around 5 million people on its shores, including Kampala, the capital of Uganda.

Lake Victoria is unusual in that it receives most of its water directly from rainfall, not from rivers, and loses most by evaporation, rather than through its outflow: the lake level has varied by around 3m over the last 120 years.

The rise in Lake Victoria levels is one of the fastest on record. East Africa has experienced major flooding since October 2019.

The exceptional 2019 rainfall was caused by warm waters in the western Indian Ocean (called a positive “Indian Ocean Dipole”, which also contributed to the Australian fires). Together with effects of tropical cyclones and westerlies between October and December this led to the Lake Victoria basin experiencing 150 to 200% of its usual rainfall.

January and February 2020 also had above average rain, possibly related to persistent warm water in the western Indian Ocean. Climate change is expected to have increased the probability of these events and so the rapid lake level rise. March to May 2020 have seen further heavy rainfall, pushing up lake levels to the near record-breaking level.

Although we do expect climate change to favour such rapid rises in lake level, it is too early to say for certain whether we expect climate change to give higher or lower lake levels overall in the long term.

It is clear though that water management plans must plan for changes due to climate change, such as the recent rapid rise.

The fact that Lake Victoria spans three nations, and is a source of the White Nile that then supplies water to South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt, means that plans for Lake Victoria have international implications, so agreements and plans should be made well in advance, to allow adequate time to address the complex issues this will raise.

Climate change will continue to intensify rainfall and flood management must adapt.

The event illustrates how ‘natural disasters’, sometimes enhanced by climate change, are often interconnected. The exceptional rain of 2019/2020 has led to flooding directly from the rainfall, as well as from rivers and the lake, and has been linked to disease outbreaks.

The weather has affected crop growth and food prices, and has contributed to the locust outbreak. People in the region are suffering impacts of these events and Covid-19 simultaneously, or in quick succession, reducing their ability to cope, and acute food insecurity is growing.

Projected impacts of climate change on populations and ecosystems, and plans to increase resilience, must account for such systematic sequences of inter-connected events, as well as random sequencing of unrelated disasters.

The work reported on in this story is part of two projects: (1) FCFA’s HyCRISTAL project (funded by DFID and NERC) which is working to both improve climate information for East Africa, and use this to inform long-term decision making in the region, (2) HyTpp (funded by DFID, through the Corridors for Growth Trust Fund administered by the World Bank), which is analysing possible Lake Victoria water levels under climate change.

More than 10,000 people who were displaced by the recent floods in Kasese District face starvation amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Kasese District Covid-19 taskforce is facing a hard time enforcing the Ministry of Health and Presidential directives aimed at stemming the spread of the pandemic in the 27 camps.

Kasese District was on May 7 and 22 hit by floods when five rivers; Lhubiriha, Mubuku, Nyamwamba, Nyamughasana and Sebwe burst their banks and affected communities in seventeen sub-counties as well as Bulembia and Nyamwamba Divisions in Kasese Municipality.

Speaking to Daily Monitor in an interview at the weekend, Mr Joshua Kisembo Masereka, the Kasese Deputy Resident District Commissioner, said the state of people living in camps scattered across various sub-counties is appalling.

“Those living in camps are traumatised and are faced with emotional and mental stress emanating from the losses they registered at an individual level,” he said.

The camps housing stranded people include; Kanyangeya, Nkaiga and Kiraro primary schools having the highest number of people concentrated in one place.

When *Daily Monitor *visited one of the camps at Kiraro Primary School, no one was seen wearing a facemask.\ Despite presence of a hand washing facility that the taskforce have improvised, no one was seen washing hands.

Mr Peter Mutooro, the camp chairperson, said they have failed to enforce the directives against Covid-19 because they are facing hunger.

""Because of Covid-19, we have started decongesting families to the nearby churches and schools so that they reduce on the numbers,"" said Mr Mutooro.

Ms Harriet Kabugho, who chairs the committee overseeing affairs for girls within the camp, said their rights as girls were being violated every day. She explained that five of her friends have been sexually harassed by the boys within the same camp.

""We do not have bathrooms, we use the same latrines and we might contract sexually transmitted diseases,"" Ms Kabugho said.

The coordinator for Centre for Gender Quality, a non-governmental organisation based in Kasese town, Ms Jolly Mbambu, advised that people who are living in camps need to be resettled.

""This will not be the first time government is resettling flood victims. It was properly done during the Bududa landslides saga,"" Ms Mbambu said.

Damage

A tentative impact assessment by the district disaster committee that was presented to the State Minister for Disaster Preparedness, Mr Musa Ecweru, in May indicates that a total of 123,800 people, most of them women and children from more than 24,760 households have been directly affected by the floods.

The most affected areas include Kilembe, Karambi, Bugoye, Maliba, Mpondwe Lhubiriha Town Council, Karusandara, Kyarumba, Mubuku Town Council and the three divisions of Kasese Municipality.","Mon, 08 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flash-flood.png,"['living', 'town', 'starvation', 'mr', 'victims', 'district', 'covid19', '10000', 'kasese', 'affected', 'camps', 'uganda', 'ms', 'washing', 'face', 'flood']",

More than 150 families, part of the 10,000 people who were displaced by the floods two years ago after water levels in Lake Albert rose, are living in a dire condition.

The lives of many locals who have gathered in Kanara Sub-county, Ntoroko District near Lake Albert, are being threatened since the temporal houses erected in water are on the verge of collapsing. The families are also in dire need of food and other essential basic needs.

The unstable houses, made of iron sheets, and reeds are being held by timber poles erected in water, some of which are rotting away and can no longer hold their weight.

Mr Justice Kabagambe,46, a resident of Kamuga Village in Kanara Sub-county, Ntoroko District, one of the affected people, in April last year erected a temporary house above the water after his house that is a few metres away from the shores of Lake Albert, was submerged by floods.

Following the incident, he joined another family whose house was submerged days later. “I decided to build a temporary four-room house where I am staying with my family,” he said.

“The family is not sure of a single meal in a day but we get support from friends and well-wishers. My house is not stable and it shakes whenever it gets windy, especially at night, we fear it may collapse,” Mr Kabagambe added.

Mr Kabagambe’s house is surrounded by 40 others in the same condition. The houses are hard to access and one has to use a boat as a means of transport to visit friends and family members settled away from the flooded area. Similarly, food and other requirements are transported by boat from the dry areas. The operators of the few available boats demand a fee for their services.

There are a few makeshift shops built above the flooded areas. Mr Kabagambe’s family is forced to keep indoors since they have no compound.

The communities also lack clean water for domestic use and are forced to draw contaminated water from the lake.

The families lack toilets too and are forced to defecate in the water. “We use the same water to ease ourselves since our toilets and tap stands were submerged,” Mr Kabagambe said.

His plight is shared by more than 150 families who have found shelter above the water.

The sub-counties that are mostly affected include Kamuga, Kachwakumu and Rwangara. The affected families are, however, holding on to hope that the government will come to their rescue.

Those who were displaced in 2019 and later in 2020, were first sheltered in nearby schools of Umoja, Rwangara and Kachwakumu, which were later submerged. The floods left homes, shops, schools, gardens and health facilities submerged.

Last year when the State minister for Disaster Preparedness and Refugees, Mr Musa Ecweru, and other officials visited the area, local leaders requested government to relocate them to Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve.

Current situation

The chairperson of Kachwakumu Village, Mr Rwaheru Byaruhanga, said while some people sought refuge with friends and family, others have nowhere to go.

He said more than 200,000 houses are still submerged and only rooftops are seen floating on top of water. “People spend days indoors and school-going children have not reported to school because their schools were submerged. Our people have also risked their lives because any time, these makeshift houses may collapse. They will also contract disease because they use contaminated water,” Mr Byaruhanga said.

Lack of food

Ntoroko District’s main economic activity is fishing and cattle keeping. The livelihood of locals was greatly hit since the floods affected livestock farming.

Accessing health centres is also a big challenge and they have to hire boats to reach Butungama or Rwebisengo sub-county for medical service. The nearby Rwangara Health Centre III was submerged.

Dr James Kato, the officer-in-charge of Rwebisengo Health Centre III, said they have to travel long distances to pick drugs.

Mr Byaruhanga said since 2019, they have been requesting the government to relocate them to Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve.

The chairperson of Kanara Sub-county, Mr Friday Mugiisa, said they have never received any relief food.

“People who are stuck in floods have no food to eat and they have been depending on fish. Last month, the UPDF fishing unit on Lake Albert destroyed all boats after accusing our people of illegal fishing,” Ms Mugiisa said.

The Ntoroko County Member of Parliament, Mr Gerald Rwemurikya Ibanda, last year told Daily Monitor that the government had promised to relocate the displaced people and settle them at Tooro Semliki Wildlife Reserve. This has not been fulfilled.

“The acres they are talking about are not enough, but sadly, they haven’t been availed to the people,” he said.

The acting chairperson of Ntoroko District, Mr Ben Muthahinga, said they recently received some relief items such as beans, posho and blankets from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), which they want to distribute to displaced people.

He said last week, the Minister for Tourism, Mr Tom Butiime, was in the area to discuss the relocation plan.

Mr Butiime confirmed that he visited Rwebisengo Town Council and held a meeting with local leaders and they agreed that Uganda Wildlife Authority reduces the restrictions on cattle keepers so that they can graze their animals in certain parts of the park.

He said the restrictions will only be applicable for farmers who have cattle but not for people who want to construct shelters in the park.

The Tourism boss also said the affected locals are being registered by the sub-county chief and they will soon be allowed to graze in the park.

Mr Julius Muchunguzi, the head of communications at the OPM, said: “The government is in the process of identifying land where the affected people can be relocated to. We have been supporting them with relief food.”

The landslides hit several sub-counties with most affected being Buwali and Bukalasi/Bundesi, Bumayoka and parts of Bubiita in the lower stream being affected by flash floods. As a direct consequence of these heavy rains, a total of four (4) major landslides occurred in Bududa: one in Bumayoka subcounty, one in Bukalasi/ Bundesi and two in Buwali. The landslides caused six (6) deaths, and injuries to 27 persons (13 males & 14 females) with all still admitted at Bududa Hospital. Amongst the injured, two (2) are children under 5 years (1 male and 1 female). First rapid assessments identified eighty (80) households as displaced (480 people), out of the 100 affected households and 669 people affected. In the neighbouring Sironko District, along the Mount Elgon slope, a devastating flood incident occurred in Buyobo Sub-County on 4th of June at around 4:00am. The continuous rains that started at 2:20am and continued consecutively for hours triggered flooding from uphill, which carried a huge mass of soil down the hills into river Bugibuni, prompting it to burst its banks and causing havoc to the communities downhill. The river carried massive water, logs of huge trees, soil debris down the slope and swept off houses and crops adjacent to it. The flash floods damaged houses of 111 households, with a population of 426 persons. Fortunately, no deaths were registered. Crops, merchandise, animals and properties worth millions of shillings were destroyed by the floodwaters. (IFRC, 24 Jun 2019)

Several landslides and floods across Bulambuli District (eastern Uganda) have resulted in 1 death and 19 missing. The most affected areas include Nabiwutulu, Gimadu Bugatiisa, and Buluganya Counties. The Uganda Red Cross Society is conducting an assessment to establish magnitude of the disaster and the needs of the people affected. Eastern Uganda was already affected by a series of landslides in early June this year, when at least 5 died. Moderate to locally heavy rain is forecast across most of Uganda on 2-3 September.

The risks include flooding, drowning, prolonged hot seasons and water scarcity, among others.

WWF Country Director David Duri (L) During a press conference at their offices in Kamwokya Kampala--

The number of people drowning due to flooding is projected to increase as Kampala city faces a shocking rise in climate change-related risks. This is according to a report; the water risk scenarios estimate research conducted by the World Wide Fund for Nature.



Launched ahead of the World Cities’ Day 2020, marked today, the reports puts Kampala on the list of 100 other cities that are expected to suffer the greatest rise in water risk problems by 2050. The risks include flooding, drowning, prolonged hot seasons and water scarcity, among others.



The report further reveals that Kampala faces the 7th highest increase in the water risks above for cities across Africa with a 10 per cent rise by the year 2050. WWF country director David Duri observes an urgent need to reclaim the preserve of urban wetlands to save the city from a high price resulting from worsening water risks.



Human activity and the destruction of wetlands has over the years been highlighted as the main cause of flooding in the city, even after light rains. Flooding is mainly seen in the city suburbs of Kyambogo-Banda, Kabuusu, Kinawataka, Kyebando-Nsooba, Bwaise, Namungoona, Nalukolongo, parts of Kasubi, Katanga, Katwe, Namasuba, Zana, and even in the city centre.



Duri mentioned Bugolobi Wetlands, Nakivubo channel, Mayanja wetland along Mityana road and others which have been encroached on, raising the risk of uncontrollable water scenarios on people’s lives and their businesses.

The natural disaster is just one of several challenges facing the region, including continuing invasions by locust swarms and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Countries affected include Rwanda, Kenya, Somalia, Burundi, Ethiopia, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti and Tanzania.

“In some areas, the lack of infrastructure or damage to roads, bridges and airstrips has made accessing flood zones far more difficult, which in turn makes it more difficult to provide assistance,” said Matt Davis, the East Africa regional director of the Catholic Relief Services.

He told Crux the crises affecting East Africa can all be linked back to climate change.

“To help prevent floods in the future and mitigate the impact, we need to make more concerted efforts to preserve and restore watersheds and landscapes. We need to support communities to improve their livelihoods while restoring and maintaining the natural environment,” Davis said.

What follows are excerpts of his conversation with Crux.

Crux: Widespread flooding has once again hit East Africa. Can you give us a sense of the enormity of the disaster?

Davis: East Africa has been experiencing torrential rains and flooding since July and almost six million people have been impacted. Around 1.5 million people have lost their homes or have been displaced by the floods and many areas are still underwater. People’s homes, crops, livestock and personal possessions have been washed away, and there has been significant damage to infrastructure.

This is all happening before the start of the short rains, which should peak in November. In some areas, the lack of infrastructure or damage to roads, bridges and airstrips has made accessing flood zones far more difficult, which in turn makes it more difficult to provide assistance. This flooding is putting hardship upon hardship for people in the region, who have also been impacted by COVID-19 and pests like desert locusts.

Catholic Relief Services is on the ground working with local partners and national governments to distribute emergency food and other necessities. Working in partnership, we’ve been providing life-saving assistance to tens of thousands of people across affected areas.

However, there is an urgent need for more funding to ensure that basic needs continue to be met, and to prevent the spread of malaria and other waterborne diseases. Though our response varies country-by-country, we are generally support families with food, water, shelter, basic essentials, sanitation, and providing cash or vouchers which in turn supports the local economy. We also support health systems to address things like malnutrition and other health-related risks. In some areas, families receive seeds, tools and fishing kits so they can have a livelihood and feed themselves.

How do these flood compare to previous flooding in the region?

Even if you just look at the floods over the last four years, the impacts and the number of people affected have grown exponentially. From Ethiopia to South Sudan to Uganda, we’re seeing communities that year after year are impacted by both floods as well as recurring drought in some places.

Our staff in various countries often comments on how weather patterns have changed, or how rain is erratic. They also say that this is the worst flooding they have seen in decades.

Many environmentalists and other experts are blaming climate change.

The locust swarms, floods, recurring drought and COVID-19 all link back to climate change in some way, and East Africa in particular is feeling the effects.

To help prevent floods in the future and mitigate the impact, we need to make more concerted efforts to preserve and restore watersheds and landscapes. We need to support communities to improve their livelihoods while restoring and maintaining the natural environment. Alternatives to charcoal, a big reason for deforestation, need to be scaled up and promoted more widely. We also have to prioritize to support communities to protect forests and plant trees.

It’s difficult to protect against some of the risks, but there are measures that can be taken to help people cope with disasters like droughts and floods that have been made worse by climate change.

For example, it’s important to ensure that people live far enough away from rivers and channels to prevent disasters like flash flooding and landslides while also better managing excess runoff.

In East Africa, we’re increasing our efforts toward landscape restoration and re-greening while at the same time providing people with a more diverse set of income opportunities and training on how to be better prepared should disaster strike.

As you said, the floods are coming amid the COVID-19 pandemic and a series of locusts swarms. This really is a triple crisis.

The combined impacts of the floods, recurrent drought, conflict, desert locust swarms, COVID-19 and the pandemic-related economic downturn are making it really hard for people to recover. Like here, months-long lockdowns also mean that many people in the region haven’t been able to work, thus losing their ability to put food on the table.

For governments and humanitarian organizations like CRS, this also creates additional strain on already scarce resources. For example, the teams sent out to manage pests like desert locusts have to take additional precautions because of coronavirus. In some remote areas, people have not even heard of the coronavirus and are not aware of the potential risk. There are a lot of misconceptions, creating more risk for frontline workers.

Early on when COVID-19 emerged as a threat in the region, we adjusted how we interacted with project participants so we could continue to provide critical support while adhering to the necessary safety precautions. So, while we had to adapt quickly, we have also largely managed to continue our emergency responses, like food or cash distributions, for example.

For example, in South Sudan, we haven’t been able to do food air drops because airstrips have been flooded. And hunger is growing because farmland is flooded, too.

In terms of COVID-19, overall, our donors have been really flexible and supportive, encouraging us to continue to provide critical support in the communities where we work. That said, funding for a large-scale COVID-19 response has not really materialized, so communities have mostly had to make do with what they had, and weather the pandemic as best they can.","Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cruxnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1000-3-5.jpeg,"['africa', 'crisis', 'food', 'support', 'east', 'massive', 'covid19', 'hit', 'communities', 'need', 'floods', 'flooding', 'latest', 'difficult']", 
61,61,FL-2020-000132-UGA,Uganda: Flood Victims Hosted At Schools Stranded As Candidates Return - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/202010050623.html,"People who were displaced by rising water levels in Lake Kyoga and settled at various public schools in Nakasongola District are pondering their next move after government announced plans to reopen schools for candidate classes.

The flood victims from 18 fishing landing sites totaling up to 1,800 have been hosted at the public schools since April while others are sleeping in churches.

""We are unsettled as district leaders because we must have a relocation plan for families that are currently hosted at the public schools because they will open for candidate classes on October 15 as planned by government,"" Mr Sam Kigula, the Nakasongola District chairperson, said in an interview last Saturday.

""We have received relief items, including the food and some tarpaulins, two times since the month of May but our worry now is about families that are staying at the different public schools,"" he added.

Mr Kigula revealed that they had hoped that the flood victims would be resettled on Kyalubanga Central Forest Reserve land as directed by President Museveni but the process is very slow.

Ms Margaret Komuhangi, the district Woman Member of Parliament, named some of the schools hosting the flood victims as Katuba Primary School, Busone Primary School and Kimaga Primary school.

""As leaders in Nakasongola, our plans are for a permanent relocation of the flood victims but the fact that some of the families now occupy school premises, which candidates are going to use, is a big concern,"" Ms Komuhangi told Daily Monitor.

""The children cannot share the same space with the displaced families because of the Covid-19 guidelines, including many other social problems that make such schools not fit for the candidate classes,"" she added.

Nabiswera Sub-county chairperson David Sserubombwe said many parents in his area are wondering how their children in candidate classes will attend schools currently hosting the displaced families.

""We have about 40 households that have camped at Katuba Primary School since April. We are yet to get information from the relevant government departments on how the children will mix up with the families whose members move out to look for the basics, including food, and return to the school,"" Mr Sserubombwe explained.

But Local Government minister Raphael Magyezi in an interview explained that government has a relocation plan where different districts that have displaced flood victims were tasked to identify some free public land for their permanent relocation.

""Let me find out from my commissioner the current status for Nakasongola District. I will brief you by Monday [today],"" Mr Magyezi said.

Meanwhile, a section of other people displaced by rising water levels in

Lake Victoria have started returning to their homes despite concerns about their safety.

Between March and June, thousands of people occupying the lake shores and some islands were displaced after water submerged various landing sites in various districts near Lake Victoria. Since then, the victims have been temporarily housed in makeshift houses on the mainland.

Government had directed local leaders in the affected districts to look for public land where flood victims can permanently be resettled. However, before government implements the planned resettlement, some victims have started returning to their homes, claiming the program has delayed.

Masaka District alone has close to 20,000 flood victims who were displaced from the landing sites of Lambu, Kaziru, Kisuku , Malembo and Kachanga in March. ""Government should allow us return to the landing sites because it has no clear programme for us,"" Mr Samuel Ssemwanga, a fisherman at Lambu Landing Site, said.

According to Mr Willy Lugoloobi, the Kalangala District chairperson, the district has not received any assistance from government to resettle the displaced people.

""Good enough the water levels are now going down, and those who want to go back can start moving, but they should keep away from the protected buffer zones,"" Mr Lugoloobi said.

Landing sites that were affected in Kalangala include Kaaya, Ssemawundo and Kitobo in Bufumira Sub-county, and Senero, Kasekulo and Kaazi Malanga in Mugoye Sub-county

In Jinja the story is not different. Those displaced from three Islands of Wabitooke, Samoka, Kisima I and Kisima II have also started returning to their homes as water levels recede.

Mr Andrew Musana, a councilor representing Walukuba and Masese in Jinja South Division, said the fishermen who have started returning risk losing their lives.

""As local leaders, we wrote letters to government to help resettle those people but we have not got a response yet. It will be risky for those people to return to those islands and government should swiftly work out a clear resettlement plan for them,"" he said.

But the flood water has not receded, the people are still marooned and now they are facing severe hunger.

Unusually heavy rains began last July, and the White Nile burst its banks, destroyed all the crops and encroached on farms and villages, affecting Jonglei and other states, leaving people to scramble for a few strips of dry land.

Fields are still submerged, mud homes and stiff sticks of dead maize are slowly collapsing into the water, entire villages have been abandoned and large areas turned into swamps. Of the 62 villages served by Old Fangak’s central market, 45 are devastated by the flooded river.

The July harvest would have fed the local people through to this spring but all the crops were lost. Families sleep in abandoned schools or in the open on scraps of higher land. There is no question of migrating to dry areas as the flood extends for miles and at least Old Fangak is secluded from the constant conflict that besets much of the rest of the country.

The UN says that about 1.6 million people have been affected by the floods in a country where already at least 7.5 million people need assistance. A recent report by the Integrated food security Phase Classification, (IPC), an initiative by 15 organisations to tackle malnutrition, estimates that 6.4 million people, about half the population, will face acute food insecurity in 2021, and for half of them their lack of food will be an emergency.

Some people in South Sudan, such as those from Old Fangak, are partially or completely cut off from humanitarian aid. Access to the town is difficult in normal times, but the detritus of the floods has blocked the airstrip, which was cleared from the bush, and boat access from the river.

Data from South Sudan suggests that more erratic and unpredictable weather patterns are now the norm.

The floods were caused by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), also known as the “Indian El Niño, a weather pattern discovered only in 1999. The strongest IOD to strike east Africa in 61 years happened in 2019. So when the rains arrived in 2020 in South Sudan, the water from the previous year had not yet receded, resulting in more devastating floods. This year’s rainfall could further worsen the situation, making the resultant hunger catastrophic.

“People will die of hunger. Everyone in Old Fangak is lacking food and lost what they cultivated. Hunger is the one that will kill people,” says Peter Kak, a fisherman and grandfather of five who lives on a grass island with his son Samuel. The two men stayed behind after sending the rest of the family to higher ground. Here, they fish every day.

“Flooding, conflict, Covid-19 and poverty make the situation here dire,” says Sulaiman Sesay, of Action Against Hunger, one of the few aid organisations active in this area of South Sudan. “The world needs to know that people are suffering in this way.”

The socioeconomic measures adopted in response to the pandemic have affected already critical hunger situations in vulnerable places such as South Sudan. A joint report by the World Food Programme and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that threatening global hunger levels seem to be reaching new highs.

In Old Fangak people grew sorghum, a cereal that is easy to cultivate. Now they can eat only water lilies and fish. But not everyone has fishing nets and for those who do the catches are rarely enough to satisfy the appetite.

“There’s not enough sorghum, so we have to resort to the water lily,” explains Samuel Gai. The flowers have to be collected in great numbers to grind and make a small amount of cereal.

Despite the severity of the floods, the people of Old Fangak refuse to give up. In the face of rising waters, hunger and isolation from the rest of the country, the community shows extraordinary resilience.

“We cooperate,” says Joseph Martin, a villager helping to repair the constantly collapsing airstrip dyke. “The women take the water out with buckets and we put the mud on the dykes to prevent water leaking in. They do their part and we do our part.

“When there is work, men and women work together and they cooperate. Some of the people come and work even without us asking them … this is how we do it, if there is work to save the town, we work together,.”

Moving water by the bucketload all day takes a huge toll on hungry people. “Because of this water, I’ve lost weight. We are doing this alone, all day and night throwing water over the dyke. Nobody comes to help us. We are all exhausted,” says Nyayen Chuol, who works on the dyke with her elderly mother.

Where dykes have already been breached many people move on to neighbours’ homes and start again, helping to keep other dykes strong.

“I’m worried all the time. At night I’m trying to stay awake with a fire so I can burn a bit of grass and go check if the dyke is leaking or about to break. Every night. I’m so worried I can’t even sleep thinking that if I fall asleep the dyke could break and I can drown,” says Nyayang Kich, who had to abandon her flooded home for the higher ground of her neighbour.

The water sitting stagnant is compromising health too, leading to a spike in malaria-carrying mosquitoes.

“The climate has changed from the years when I was young because we have never experienced floods like this before. What we are experiencing now is horrible. We are suffering from hunger and we didn’t before. The climate has changed. For old people it’s horrible. It’s hard moving in this water; we don’t know where to sleep or what to eat. We are in God’s hands,” says 83-year-old Mary Nyamat.","Fri, 19 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98594f91e045de1aa58e97ae674b51bf2afed6fa/0_650_8272_4963/master/8272.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=11e7d9fdab4148e3e033de26dd5f581e,"['south', 'hunger', 'villages', 'food', 'work', 'night', 'land', 'drowned', 'old', 'sudans', 'flooded', 'floods', 'sudan', 'water', 'fangak', 'stalks']", 
63,63,FL-2020-000132-UGA,KCCA names most risky roads during rainy season - Daily Monitor,https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/kcca-names-most-risky-roads-during-rainy-season-3337244,"By Franklin Draku More by this Author

In December 2019, five people were killed by floods in Kampala after a downpour.

The dead included a police officer, an army officer and three others.

Earlier on May 26, 2019, eight other people died in a similar manner.

The floods hit many parts of the capital, cut off roads and destroyed several property in Kampala and surrounding areas of Bwaise, Nateete, Nalukolongo, Bugolobi, Nakawa ,Industrial Area, and Kyambogo. About 500 households were affected.

Following these incidents, Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) carried out a risk assessment and identified the most dangerous or risky roads that are vulnerable to floods during rainy season.

Based on the findings of the assessment, on March 24, 2021, KCCA issued a warning to Kampala residents about the flood hotspots and warned road users and residents.

This comes shortly after the Uganda weather authorities forecast that the country will be seeing more heavy rain characterised by flooding, strong winds, and lightning.

“Due to the current heavy rain, the public is warned that there will be a number of inconveniences from flooding i.e. submerging some of our roads and collapse of our aged infrastructure. Further, our transport infrastructure will be directly or indirectly damaged during these weather conditions posing a threat to human safety and causing significant disruption,” a KCCA public notice states.

“This arises from an inefficient storm water drainage system that is intended to manage overland flow. Government is organising funding to implement the Kampala Drainage Master Plan, which is intended to solve this problem,” the notice added.

Damaged roads

Many city roads are in poor state with potholes and a big number have been washed away.

Last week, a drainage channel at Mukwano Road roundabout that was completed last month caved in. The public accused Uganda National Roads Authority, KCCA officials, and contractors of connivance to do shoddy work on the channel.

One Twitter user, Mr Keith Ahumuza, posted that such shoddy works points to the issue of bad governance that Uganda is grappling with.

“The events playing out in our country currently from debts, injustices, corruption scandals, substandard works, and judicial issues are fruits of the kind of system that has been sown. Africa’s problem is not its people but the governance systems. God has His way of embarrassing,” he tweeted.

Ms Sharon Keitesi, another Twitter user, drew parallels with Tanzania, noting that if such had happened there, heads would have rolled at KCCA.

“If this had happened in Tanzania under the late Magufuli leadership, all the KCCA engineering team would be in jail but since this is Uganda, that’s normal and it cannot make any of the concerned authorities panic,” she tweeted.

On their part, the city authorities said: “There were defects on the recently completed works by one of our contractors on a Nakivubo Channel section at Mukwano Roundabout on Sixth Street, Industrial Area. The contractor, who undertook the failed works, shall be required to remedy according to the contract.”

“We appeal to the public to take precautions while using public infrastructure during the rainy season as government puts in place mechanisms to improve it,” a KCCA statement read.

Hopeful

Kampala drainage master plan

The city authorities completed the new Kampala Drainage Master Plan in December 2017.

According to a report to Parliament, the master plan provides structural measures to improve the city drainage and non-structural measures such as improving solid waste management and promoting use of green/pervious compounds to absorb floods.

KCCA officials say the implementation will cost $208m (about Shs758.6 billion). It is not clear if the funding for the master plan has been secured.

64,64,FL-2020-000132-UGA,Uganda: Living Dangerously - the Plight of Ntoroko Flood-Affected Families - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/202104140086.html,"More than 150 families, part of the 10,000 people who were displaced by the floods two years ago after water levels in Lake Albert rose, are living in a dire condition.

The lives of many locals who have gathered in Kanara Sub-county, Ntoroko District near Lake Albert, are being threatened since the temporal houses erected in water are on the verge of collapsing. The families are also in dire need of food and other essential basic needs.

The unstable houses, made of iron sheets, and reeds are being held by timber poles erected in water, some of which are rotting away and can no longer hold their weight.

Mr Justice Kabagambe,46, a resident of Kamuga Village in Kanara Sub-county, Ntoroko District, one of the affected people, in April last year erected a temporary house above the water after his house that is a few metres away from the shores of Lake Albert, was submerged by floods.

Following the incident, he joined another family whose house was submerged days later. ""I decided to build a temporary four-room house where I am staying with my family,"" he said.

""The family is not sure of a single meal in a day but we get support from friends and well-wishers. My house is not stable and it shakes whenever it gets windy, especially at night, we fear it may collapse,"" Mr Kabagambe added.

Mr Kabagambe's house is surrounded by 40 others in the same condition. The houses are hard to access and one has to use a boat as a means of transport to visit friends and family members settled away from the flooded area. Similarly, food and other requirements are transported by boat from the dry areas. The operators of the few available boats demand a fee for their services.

There are a few makeshift shops built above the flooded areas. Mr Kabagambe's family is forced to keep indoors since they have no compound.

The communities also lack clean water for domestic use and are forced to draw contaminated water from the lake.

The families lack toilets too and are forced to defecate in the water. ""We use the same water to ease ourselves since our toilets and tap stands were submerged,"" Mr Kabagambe said.

His plight is shared by more than 150 families who have found shelter above the water.

The sub-counties that are mostly affected include Kamuga, Kachwakumu and Rwangara. The affected families are, however, holding on to hope that the government will come to their rescue.

Those who were displaced in 2019 and later in 2020, were first sheltered in nearby schools of Umoja, Rwangara and Kachwakumu, which were later submerged. The floods left homes, shops, schools, gardens and health facilities submerged.

Last year when the State minister for Disaster Preparedness and Refugees, Mr Musa Ecweru, and other officials visited the area, local leaders requested government to relocate them to Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve.

Current situation

The chairperson of Kachwakumu Village, Mr Rwaheru Byaruhanga, said while some people sought refuge with friends and family, others have nowhere to go.

He said more than 200,000 houses are still submerged and only rooftops are seen floating on top of water. ""People spend days indoors and school-going children have not reported to school because their schools were submerged. Our people have also risked their lives because any time, these makeshift houses may collapse. They will also contract disease because they use contaminated water,"" Mr Byaruhanga said.

Lack of food

Ntoroko District's main economic activity is fishing and cattle keeping. The livelihood of locals was greatly hit since the floods affected livestock farming.

Accessing health centres is also a big challenge and they have to hire boats to reach Butungama or Rwebisengo sub-county for medical service. The nearby Rwangara Health Centre III was submerged.

Dr James Kato, the officer-in-charge of Rwebisengo Health Centre III, said they have to travel long distances to pick drugs.

Mr Byaruhanga said since 2019, they have been requesting the government to relocate them to Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve.

The chairperson of Kanara Sub-county, Mr Friday Mugiisa, said they have never received any relief food.

""People who are stuck in floods have no food to eat and they have been depending on fish. Last month, the UPDF fishing unit on Lake Albert destroyed all boats after accusing our people of illegal fishing,"" Ms Mugiisa said.

The Ntoroko County Member of Parliament, Mr Gerald Rwemurikya Ibanda, last year told Daily Monitor that the government had promised to relocate the displaced people and settle them at Tooro Semliki Wildlife Reserve. This has not been fulfilled.

""The acres they are talking about are not enough, but sadly, they haven't been availed to the people,"" he said.

The acting chairperson of Ntoroko District, Mr Ben Muthahinga, said they recently received some relief items such as beans, posho and blankets from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), which they want to distribute to displaced people.

He said last week, the Minister for Tourism, Mr Tom Butiime, was in the area to discuss the relocation plan.

Mr Butiime confirmed that he visited Rwebisengo Town Council and held a meeting with local leaders and they agreed that Uganda Wildlife Authority reduces the restrictions on cattle keepers so that they can graze their animals in certain parts of the park.

He said the restrictions will only be applicable for farmers who have cattle but not for people who want to construct shelters in the park.

The Tourism boss also said the affected locals are being registered by the sub-county chief and they will soon be allowed to graze in the park.

Mr Julius Muchunguzi, the head of communications at the OPM, said: ""The government is in the process of identifying land where the affected people can be relocated to. We have been supporting them with relief food.""","Tue, 13 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['floodaffected', 'family', 'ntoroko', 'living', 'plight', 'house', 'submerged', 'dangerously', 'subcounty', 'families', 'affected', 'uganda', 'water', 'houses', 'wildlife', 'mr']", 
65,65,FL-2020-000132-UGA,Uganda: Voters Task Candidates to Fix Floods As Campaigns Start - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/202011110360.html,"By Felix Basiime

Residents of Ntoroko District have tasked all candidates seeking elective positions to address the issues of floods and drought that have persistently plagued the area.

The district experiences extreme floods during the wet season and drought during the dry season every year. Cattle keepers lose hundreds of cows to drought while during the rainy season, thousands are displaced.

Since May, floods have displaced about 10,000 people in the district as water from Lake Albert spilled into the communities about 10kms away. The most affected residents are from Kanara and Butungama sub-counties and Kanara Town Council.

Mr James Balinda, who now lives in Butungama Sub-county after he was displaced by floods from Kamuga Village in Kanara Sub-county, says over the years, their leaders, especially the MPs, have failed to address the challenge of floods.

""The leaders come here and make empty promises. Years have passed yet we have not seen any leader in his or her manifesto talking about issues of drought and floods on how they can be addressed,"" Mr Balinda says.

He adds due to the current floods, residents have lost their livelihoods and there is no plan by the government to help them get back to their feet.

The current floods have damaged roads, schools, and health facilities, among others, but residents say the government must look for solutions to see that people access social services.

Residents puzzled

Ms Agnes Muhindo, another flood victim, says: ""We have been told that the current floods will take more than three years for our area to normalise and our concern is where we shall be staying during this period?""

She suggests that government should consider relocating all the displaced people to safer areas to avoid losing their lives. Mr Abraham Asiiimwe, a cattle keeper from Rwebisengo Town Council, says government has in the past promised to construct valley dams in the area to tap excess water to be used during the dry season by cattle keepers but this has never happened.

The area MP, Mr Gerald Rwemurikya Ibanda, says he has been in talks with the central government through the Prime Minister's office, which has promised to relocate the displaced flood victims on 30 acres of land that is part of Tooro-Semuliki game reserve.

""Three government ministers came here and assessed the situation and promised to give us land and when I talked to the Prime Minister, he said they will give us 30 acres of the land part of the game park,"" Mr Rwemurikya says.

Umoja, Kachwakumu and Rwangara primary schools and Rwangara Health Centre III are submerged in water.

The candidates in the submerged schools were shifted to others in the nearest sub-counties not affected by floods.

Crux of the matter

According to Mr Gideon Masereka, a geographer, the northern part of Ntoroko has an escarpment (a long steep slope) that starts from Kichwamba side in Kabarole District up to Bundibugyo and the lower land up to Lake Albert.

Mr Masereka explains that during the wet season, rivers in the Mount Rwenzori range, which Ntoroko is close to, are always in the youthful stage when it rains.

They keep rising and flowing with a lot of water. By the time they reach the low lands of Ntoroko, they are in an old stage that ends up causing floods.","Tue, 10 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['campaigns', 'candidates', 'ntoroko', 'water', 'schools', 'season', 'fix', 'drought', 'land', 'district', 'voters', 'displaced', 'floods', 'uganda', 'start', 'task', 'mr']", 
66,66,FL-2020-000132-UGA,"Floods, storms and searing heat: 2020 in extreme weather - The Guardian",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/30/floods-storms-and-searing-heat-2020-in-extreme-weather,"This year has broken a series of unwelcome weather records. Last month was the warmest November in history. This followed the hottest January, May and September. All-time temperature peaks were registered from the Antarctic to the Arctic. Since the start of the year, Australia, Siberia and California have suffered record fires. The Atlantic has generated record storms. Ice in the Laptev Sea has started forming later than ever.

The coronavirus pandemic may have dominated the news and temporarily reduced emissions. But 2020 has also demonstrated the increasingly evident impact of human-driven global heating. The six hottest years in human history have all occurred since 2014. That sequence will certainly continue for a seventh year. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) will soon know whether 2020 will take first, second or third place in the all-time ranking.

Scientists are surprised temperatures have been so high in the absence of an El Niño, the phenomenon that boosts warmer years such as the current record, 2016. On the contrary, the latter half of this year there was the emergence of a cooling La Niña, which churned up chillier-than-normal waters in the equatorial Pacific. Petteri Taalas, the secretary-general of the WMO, said that without this influence, 2020 would certainly have been the warmest year ever measured.

In climate terms, the long-term trend is more important than individual records, but it is the latter that directly affects lives and livelihoods. Unusual heat, drought, fires or storms can be caused by natural variation, local factors or industrial emissions, but scientists are increasingly able to identify that extreme weather events are more frequent and intense as greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere.

“2020 has been another very hot year. We see very strongly the impact of what that means on the changing intensity and likelihood of extreme weather events,” said Friederike Otto, the associate director of the Environmental Change Institute at University of Oxford and co-lead of the World Weather Attribution initiative (WWA). “Every year of more emissions and increasing global mean temperature has an impact on people.”

Humankind’s fingerprint was particularly evident in the Siberian heatwave, which was made at least 600 times more probable by humans, and the Australian bushfires, which were made more than 30% more likely.

Here is how this year unfolded with global heating at 1.1C above pre-industrial levels. This toll may seem horrifying, but it is just a sample – and will be modest compared with a future world on course for more than 3C of warming.

1 January

Record floods in Indonesia kill at least 19 people, with 62,000 evacuated. The national meteorological agency reports the highest daily rainfall seen in Jakarta since records began in 1866: “This is not ordinary rain.”

4 January

Temperatures in the Sydney basin hit a new high of 48.9C, the latest in a series of records in Australia. Bushfires create a 620 miles (1,000km) wide, 21 miles high smoke cloud, three times bigger than anything seen in the world before. It spreads so far that black charcoal reaches Antarctica. Scientists describe it as “a new benchmark on the magnitude of stratospheric perturbations”.

31 March

The Australian bushfire season comes to an end after more than six months of destruction – 33 fatalities, 3,000 homes burned, and more than 10m hectares (25m acres) razed. Wildlife deaths are estimated at more than 1bn mammals, birds and reptiles combined, and hundreds of billions of insects. From the beginning of September 2019 to 23 February 2020, bushfires have emitted 434m tonnes of carbon dioxide, equivalent to about three-quarters of the discharges of Australian industry. Studies by the WWA indicate the bushfires were made at least 30% more probable by human-driven climate change. The summer of 2019-2020 is the second-hottest ever, after the previous year’s summer.

20 June

Record Arctic heat. The Russian town of Verkhoyansk registers 38C (more than 100F) amid a freakishly prolonged Siberian heatwave. Siberian wildfires cover almost 1m hectares and release 59m tonnes of carbon dioxide, surpassing last year’s record. On average, temperatures in this region of the Arctic have been 5C above average in the first six months of the year. Scientists from the WWA say this was made at least 600 times more probable by human emissions.

KAMPALA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- At least two children were killed by floods following heavy rains in the western Ugandan district of Rubanda on Saturday, police said here Sunday.

Elly Maate, the Kigezi regional police spokesperson in a statement, said two female juveniles were swept away by running water at Karengyere village, Muko Sub County, amid a heavy down pour.

""Police in Muko received information that two female juveniles were yesterday (Saturday) swept by running water amid heavy down pour. Bodies were retrieved pending postmortem,"" said Maate.

Several parts of the east African country, especially western and eastern regions, are currently experiencing normal to above normal rainfall, with destructive effects, according to the weather department.

In its March-May seasonal rainfall outlook, the Uganda National Meteorological Authority warned of enhanced rainfall over several parts of the country that could result into disasters such as landslides and foods, leading to loss of lives and destruction of property in the first major rain season.

Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) has significantly dealt with the challenge of flooding in the City.

A year ago, Kampala was experiencing floods at certain black spots that made navigation at those points impossible to go past for several hours after a downpour.

These locations included; Clock Tower on Entebbe Road that often covered the Fire Brigade headquarters parking; Mulwana Road in Bugoloobi Parish; at the Electoral Commission head office on Jinja Road; and the Bwaise communities in Kawempe Division. The floods disrupted navigation in the city, damaged both business and household property as well as affecting livelihoods in vulnerable communities.

KCCA embarked on an aggressive drainage infrastructure development programme in line with the Kampala Drainage Master Plan (KDMP) and the Kampala Capital City Strategic Plan 2020/2021-2024/2025 whose strategic goal is that “by June 2025 Kampala will be an inclusive, liveable, resilient and well planned city that provides economic opportunities to all”. The strategic plan is anchored on four pillars; Economic growth, governance and citizen engagement, quality of life and city resilience.

Some of the projects done or in progress include the construction of the Lubigi and Nakamiro channels with a combined stretch of 5.88Km at Shs82.7B launched in August 2020 by President Museveni. The two channels will solve the flood water menace in the low lying areas of Bwaise, stretching into Kawala in Rubaga Division.

The Clock Tower area and Mulwana Road flooding has been significantly dealt with by downstream interventions on Nakivubo Channel in the Kanyogoga swamp catchment area in Makindye and Nakawa divisions.

Here KCCA is desilting and widening the channel by removing gravel and other sediments that affect the breadth, depth and flow of water. The box culvert constructed on Mulwana Road plus widening and constructing the open drain that feeds into Nakivubo channel is already proving that the area shall be floodless when works are completed. The drainage works under the Kampala Flyover Project are to further solve the stagnation challenge at Clock Tower.

Other drainage improvement works including construction of St Dennis Channel that flows through Kulekana and Nakinyuguzi Channel in Salaama Parish, both in Makindye Division. In Central Division, KCCA is working on Kitamanya’agamba drain (below the Law Development Centre) in Kagugube Parish. In Rubaga Division, Nabulagala Channel and the box culvert along Sentema Road have been constructed, hence mitigating the flooding incidences.

Also in Rubaga Division, interim interventions on sections of Nalukolongo Primary Channel are ahead of the planned reconstruction once funds are obtained for both the channel works and remaining compensation of persons.

One of the key challenges affecting the efficiency of drainage channels is garbage. There is a lot of irresponsible dumping of garbage (polythene, plastic bottles and trade refuse) that ends up blocking the drainage system once it is swept away by surface water run-off or when dumped in the channels causing surface runoff build up and stagnation (floods). Whereas KCCA has emergency teams at the drainage channels during the rain, we appeal to the public to responsibly manage waste.

Another challenge is the illegal developments and encroachments on drainage reserves of primary and secondary channels. Some developers have constructed over the drains while others have illegally diverted the course of drainage channels. Consequently, the capacity of these drains has decreased and maintenance affected resulting in flooding as seen in Bugolobi, Nalukolongo Kamwokya, and Kansanga areas.

The KDMP was developed to improve the old, dilapidated and inefficient existing drainage systems. It recommends both structural and non-structural measures.

Sorting out Kampala’s drainage challenges may not be a fortnight or season’s work but great strides have been taken for one to confidently note that the floods are no more in Kampala, save for the temporal stagnation that usually clears within 10 to 15 minutes after a heavy downpour.

Traffic and business came to a standstill on Wednesday following a heavy downpour in Kampala.



The most affected roads were John Babiiha road where road construction works are on-going and Kyaggwe Road near Swaminarayan Temple. People with businesses along Kyaggwe road were forced to close after water entered their shops.



Business at Ham Shopping Grounds also came to a standstill as Nakivubo Channel overflowed and left the shops submerged in water.



The floods flowing from Clock Tower to Nakivubo Channel submerged the road making it nearly impassable for pedestrians and small cars. Some people were forced to remove their shoes, fold their trousers and wade through the floodwaters.



Some men were seen charging 1,000 shillings to carry pedestrians who didn't want to wade through the water, on their backs.



This isn't the first time Clock Tower is flooding. Various attempts have been made in vain to improve the drainage and ease the water flow.



Brian Bagala, an Engineer in charge of drainage at Kampala Capital City Authority-KCCA says the Clock Tower is bound to flood especially now that the area is excavated as works continue under the Kampala Fly Over project. He says as works proceed, some of the drainages in the area has been affected.



He, however, says the status will improve when the Flyover Project is concluded and the drainage in the area is worked upon.



//Cue in: ""When a development...""



Cue out: ""...to be there""//



The Nakibubo Channel is the converging area for storm-water in the Central Business area. Over 500 manholes are placed in the City leading storm-water into Nakivubo Channel. However, the channel is overwhelmed due to the grounding erection of buildings that have taken up the green spaces that could accommodate water.



In 2019, with funding from World Bank under the Kampala Institutional Infrastructure Development Project, KCCA contracted a consultant company, Nippon Engineering to study the channel and conduct an assessment, modelling and redesigning of the catchment area.



The consultant was supposed to conclude works by this month but Bagala says their activities were interrupted by COVID -19 Lockdown and were hence granted more time until December 2020.

71,71,FL-2020-000132-UGA,Heavy rains may mar quality of Ugandan coffee crop: official - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-coffee-idUSKBN2330PZ,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - The quality of Uganda’s coffee crop may decline in the coming months as heavy rains across the east African nation have reduced the amount of sunshine necessary for bean drying, an industry official told Reuters on Wednesday.

Uganda is Africa’s largest exporter of coffee followed by Ethiopia and grows mostly robusta variety.

The country has been pounded by unusually heavy rains that started in August resulting in deaths, displacement and extensive damage to roads and other infrastructure.

Western Uganda, including the foothills of the Rwenzori mountains that are among the biggest coffee growing areas, has received some of the most intense rains.

“The drying process is a major problem in most of the places...the weather is not good for drying,” David Muwonge, head of marketing at the National Union of Coffee Agribusiness and Farmer Enterprises (NUCAFE) told Reuters.

“There’s a higher risk of beans becoming mouldy unless farmers are well sensitised.”

Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA), the state-run regulator, forecasts Uganda’s bean exports will climb 16% to 5.1 million 60-kg (132-pound) bags in the current crop year ending September.

The country’s coffee output has surged in recent years, the fruition of a government programme that has been distributing free seedlings to farmers to expand acreage and replace aging trees.

Authorities say their target is to help boost annual production to 20 million bags by 2025.

The beans have traditionally been Uganda’s biggest commodity export but were recently overtaken by gold which now annually earns the country over $1 billion.

Muwonge said the damage to transport infrastructure by the rains and flooding was likely slow the flow of beans from farms and collection centres from some of the deep rural areas.","Tue, 26 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['drying', 'farmers', 'official', 'crop', 'quality', 'beans', 'million', 'coffee', 'damage', 'ugandan', 'rains', 'mar', 'ugandas', 'heavy', 'told']",

Above-average 2020 second season cereal harvest expected in bi‑modal rainfall areas

Delayed and reduced 2020 harvest gathered in Karamoja Region

Abundant seasonal rains benefiting pastoral livelihoods

Prices of maize at low levels due to adequate availabilities and depressed demand

Food security situation still affected by measures to contain spread of COVID‑19 pandemic, despite phasing out of some restrictions

Above-average 2020 second season cereal harvest expected in bi‑modal rainfall areas

In bi‑modal rainfall areas covering most of the country, harvesting of the 2020 second season crops is about to start and will be completed in January. The September‑November rainy season was characterized by abundant precipitations, especially in northern areas, favouring crop establishment and development. Vegetation conditions are good across the country (see ASI map) and an above-average crop production is expected. However, the torrential rains triggered flooding in September and October near Lake Albert and Lake Kyoga, in northwestern Amuru, Adjumani, Obongi, Packwach, Moyo, Lamwo and Arua districts and in eastern Butaleja and Mbale districts. In addition, landslides occurred in mountain areas of eastern Mbale, southern Kisoro and western Bunyangabo districts. Floods and landslides affected about 16 500 people and caused losses of lives, damage to infrastructure and localized crop losses. Subsequently, in late November, heavy rains caused floods in Mbarara District and landslides in Kasese District, both located in the South-Western Region, affecting more than 2 000 people.

The first season harvest concluded in July and production was estimated at above‑average levels due to abundant seasonal rains, despite localized but significant flood-related production shortfalls.

Total cereal production for 2020 is put at about 3.6 million tonnes, nearly 4 percent up from 2019 and similar to the average of the previous five years.

In February 2020, a desert locust outbreak affected northeastern Teso and Karamoja subregions and northern Acholi and Lango subregions. Damage to pastures and crops was localized as swarms were of relatively small size and the Government, with the support of FAO, carried out effective control operations. Although as of late November no swarms were present in the country, Cyclone Gati hit northern Somalia on 22 November 2020 bringing heavy rains and creating a conducive environment for the formation of several immature swarms in early December. Some of these swarms could reach northern Kenya by mid‑December. As a result, there is a concrete risk of another locust invasion of northeastern and northern areas of the country, characterized by an already fragile food security situation. The desert locust response plan is 90 percent funded through multiple donors and agencies, and contingency plans are in place for surveillance and control measures.

Delayed and reduced harvest gathered in Karamoja Region

In the uni‑modal rainfall agro‑pastoral Karamoja Region, the April‑September rainy season had an early onset in March, with heavy rains triggering flooding and waterlogging which resulted in delayed and reduced plantings, also due to seed shortages. As a result, although the good performance of seasonal rains benefitted yields, cereals and pulses were harvested in October, with about a one‑month delay, and production is estimated at 10‑20 percent below average due to a reduced planted area and to the continuation of seasonal rains into October, which resulted in increased post-harvest losses.

Abundant seasonal rains benefitting pastoral livelihoods

In the agro‑pastoral areas of Cattle Corridor and Karamoja Region, abundant rains between September and November have resulted in above‑average rangeland conditions (see Vegetation Condition Index Map). Ample availability of water and pasture benefitted animal body conditions, with above‑average levels of meat and milk production. However, in Cattle Corridor significant losses of pasture due to floods have been reported in western Ntoroko and Bullisa districts and in central Nakasongola District. In Karamoja Region, the restrictive measures introduced to curb the spread of the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and the COVID‑19 pandemic, coupled with persisting insecurity related to cattle raids, have disrupted livestock movements and, animal and milk sales.

Prices of maize at low levels due to adequate availabilities and depressed demand

Prices of maize decreased by about 50 percent between May and August in all monitored markets, including the capital, Kampala, as the commercialization of the first season harvest increased market availabilities. The COVID‑19‑related restrictions exerted further downward pressure on prices, as demand by restaurants, hotels, schools and urban households was constrained by a lower economic activity and declines in incomes. Prices increased by about 15‑20 percent in September, as seasonal patterns were compounded by flood‑related trade disruptions, remaining subsequently mostly stable in October and November. Prices of maize in November were almost 40 percent below their year‑earlier levels.

In the cereal deficit Karamoja Region, the availability of low priced cereals from neighbouring surplus producing areas in Soroti, Lira and Acholi regions has resulted in a generalized decline of cereal prices, despite the below‑average local harvest. In several markets of the region, including Moroto, Kaabong and Napak, prices of sorghum in September were up to 20 percent below their year‑earlier levels.

The restrictive measures introduced in March and April 2020 by the Government to curb the spread of the COVID‑19 pandemic had a substantial adverse impact on the food security situation. Despite the easing of restrictions in June/July, the economic and livelihood recovery has been slow.

According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, conducted in Karamoja Region, refugee settlements, host communities and urban areas, 2 million people (17 percent of the analyzed population) are estimated to be severely food insecure (IPC Phase 3: “Crisis” and Phase 4: “Emergency”) in the period September 2020-January 2021.

KEY MESSAGES

After an early onset, the March to May rainfall season peaked in late April and early May. Torrential rain caused floods in the Lake Victoria basin, major river basins, and low-lying flood-prone areas. At least 845,000 people were displaced across the Horn, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, according to data available from OCHA and country governments.

The rainfall season began to subside by mid-May, marking an earlier-than-normal end to the season in some short rains- and Gudependent areas of the Horn and an atypical dry spell in parts of Uganda. Dry and hot conditions are expected in bimodal areas of the Horn until the onset of the short rains/Deyr rains in late September/October.

Rangeland conditions remain exceptionally favorable in most bimodal areas. However, crop production prospects in eastern and southeastern Kenya, southern and northwestern Somalia, southwestern Ethiopia, parts of Uganda, and southeastern South Sudan are being closely monitored due to the mixed effects of heavy rainfall and floods, early end of season, and desert locusts.","Sat, 13 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1522366-EAST_AFRICA_Seasonal_Monitor_2020_06_07_final.png?itok=o2uM5OJJ,"['africa', 'seasonal', 'season', 'rainfall', '2020', 'areas', 'parts', 'east', 'horn', 'early', 'short', 'monitor', 'southeastern', 'rains', 'world', 'uganda', '12']",

SPRINGFIELD - Water continues to rise in some parts of Livingston Parish as Tropical Depression Beta brews in the Gulf.

The storm surge produced wind speeds up 30 mph, causing flooding along the immediate coasts of the Gulf, Lake Maurepas and Lake Pontchartrain. Livingston Parish officials say the water has risen a few feet in just 24 hours.

Along the Tickfaw River, you can find high water signs, roadways submerged in water, and businesses that were forced to close because of the flooding.

Cameron Ferachi, a resident in the Terry Harbor neighborhood, says it floods every time a storm comes their way.

""I need a boat to get to and from my truck,"" Ferachi said.

Ferachi's camp sits at the end of a flooded road. To avoid pushing water into homes or damage to his vehicle, he and his best friend Mike have come up with a solution. They kayak to and from their trucks, which are parked at the end of the street.

Paddling up and down the roads they usually travel down in a vehicle is not a situation they're excited to be in.

""When the water comes up, you get people out here sightseeing, pushing water in front of everybody. It really sucks,"" Ferachi said.

These conditions are so inconvenient for some locals, like Ferachi, that they plan to move away.

""I'm actually moving Oct. 13 to get away from the flooding. I can't deal with it anymore,"" Ferachi said from his kayak.

In the meantime, flash flood warnings and advisories remain active in the area through Wednesday, Sept. 23.

Livingston Parish officials say they will continue to monitor the area. If you are in need of sand or sandbags, supplies are available at your local fire department.

As we conclude the celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, lets remind ourselves about cities across the globe that have been designed to embrace livable and sustainable human settlement while putting a comparison with Uganda’s capital that poses as a flopped state seeking emergence renaissance. A ‘1.7 million people City’ seated on 189 square kilometers gives an average density of 8994 persons per square kilometer approximately (UBOS data 2019), with numerous hills and beautiful sceneries that have attracted the largest number of Ugandan elites.

The uncontrolled organic urban development taking pace on the look of urban authorities that has rendered ex-green belts, swamps and public harbours susceptible to a risk of being eaten up by human activities. The increasing land value in the city centre is sending away the urban poor and directing them to settling in wetlands and other protected areas due to lack of alternatives.

Kampala has for a longtime proved to be a city with imbalances between population growth and settlement patterns. It is a place of sarcastic and adverse urban development, city-wide decay and low rate of response to emergencies. Pavements and rooftops mean that less rainwater can soak into the ground. The pattern of streets and buildings has interrupted some of the natural drainage ways and reduced the width of some channels. As a result, more water runs off more quickly, and the drainage system has often become overloaded.

The city is majorly challenged with lack of hydraulic and hydrological-related data where it has failed to manage a clear record of its rainfall amounts, wetland distribution, drainage systems and general water flows data, uncontrolled urban expansion, abandoned buildings, illegal connections of sewage into the separate drainage network, and great amounts of sediments and organic matter which decrease the performance of the drainage facilities, lack of legal instruments and difficulty to approve new legislation, urban planning restrictions, institutional and political problems, opposition by the population, designers and public managers.

Additionally, it’s identified with overlooked scramble and partitioning of land within the wetlands hence bleeding with limited space for catchment of storm water. Land managers spearhead wetland destruction through personalisation and issuing of land titles in these vulnerable places.

The notion, “water is life” is gradually decelerating in the city centre since a dream of a heavy rain is a nightmare to many. The manner in which wetland resources have been depleted is a disgrace to the face of urban planning as a profession and provokes ridiculers into questioning the prevailing urban management systems. The massive erosion, silting of drainage channels, poor waste management as well as reclamation all contribute to this ‘city of floods.’

Natives interpret the status quo as a normal phenomenon that seasonally comes and goes, forgetting the long-term consequences that are left behind. People seem not to be bothered because after a flood wash, business resumes ordinarily.

The urban authority in-charge of the city alleges that it formulated a drainage master plan to curb the flood and its effects which has been challenged with limited funding and skilled workmanship. The drainage master plan that was formulated in 2003 was a way of directing storm water that increased steadily due to the reduction in the green spaces that have been pressurised by the ever-increasing population.

Until now its workability is questioned. This has overtime hyped the concern of many government bodies including the National Physical Planning Board that has responded by cautioning the city managers to take concern of the known flooding, housing and planning challenges to ensure improved livelihoods for the citizens. The challenges of excess storm water management in Kampala can be wrapped under one theme “lack of an operational and easily implementable urban and environmental master plan”.

In 2016, an Italian based consultancy firm specialised in water and land scape designing called “SGI Studio Galli Ingegneria” was contracted to review the 2003 Kampala Drainage Master Plan to check its operationability, its challenges and to pledge a way forward, a project that lasted for five months.

As a result, different additions were observed and taken onboard. It has also been noted with great concern that drainage has been given priority under KIIDP 2, a project that supports Kampala City improvement through world bank funding. However, it is ironical to say that with all such consideration, the drainage system has continued to smack as the biggest challenge that the ‘country’s capital’ battles with especially during a heavy rain.

The central government’s silence over the castrophe makes one to think that there is a ‘burning solution’ that is being planned indoors that is yet to be unveiled, only to hear tales. Kampala metropolitan is a home of numerous wetlands including Bwaise, Ndeeba, Katwe, Nakivubo, Namasuba among others but soon will be living in a shadow of its glamorous natural resources as more swamps continue to be reclaimed.

The city of floods is this town that has been built on wetlands without safeguards to stormwater/flooding and yet city buildings and infrastructure seat on former water catchment arenas. Therefore, city wide developments should be established in a manner that advocates for the wellbeing of natural resources, drainage channels should be reconstructed, waste should be properly disposed at household level, buildings close to drainage channels should have paved compounds as ways of controlling blockages in stormwater flow.

Management of a flood wash should be handled by respective risk management committees at local council level, maintain records of the people/areas affected and have constant checkups and monitoring tours within these sections but most importantly to utilize the use of a GIS system to predict future hazards.

Finally, the city authority must perceive the fact that people settling in these low-lying areas are to stay with the flood until our contemporary political and budgetary system support proper urban planning.

Enforcement of non-structural planning laws is particularly challenging due to the physically extensive informal housing in wetlands which is exacerbated by political, policy, and socioeconomic arrangements.

“There may not be enough time to prepare after you are notified of a flood watch…” (Boulder, 2002). Therefore, urban managers should also empower communities to maintain their drainage systems, through regular inspection and cleaning of drains, an important task that can be performed without specialized skills.

Mr Rahim Lubadde is a physical planner.

Leaders in Kikuube and Hoima districts are demanding the government to allocate part of Kabwoya Kaiso-Tonya Community Wildlife conservation area to resettle thousands of flood victims.



Kabwoya Kaiso-Tonya Community wildlife conservation area is situated in Kabwoya and Buseruka sub-counties in Hoima and Kikuube districts.



Over 20,000 people have been displaced by floods in the two districts of Hoima and Kikuube since March.



The most affected landing sites in Hoima are Tonya, Kijangi, Kaiso, Rwentali, Hoimo, Fofo, Mbegu, Waaki and Kiryamboga among others, while the affected areas in Kikuube include Nkondo, Sebigoro, Ususa, Senjojo, Wangjok, Busiki and Nsonga.



The flood victims have sought refuge in churches and schools while others are sleeping out in coldness under trees as the floods continue to ravage the area. Area leaders and the affected persons say the only option is to resettle them to the game reserve.



Peter Kyasimire a resident of Nkondo landing site in Kabwoya Sub County in Kikuube district says the government should consider the lives of the people and have them resettled.



//Cue in;”Abataka ba Nkondo…



Cue out: “…kyo kwi kara.”/



Joyce Akumu who was displaced by floods at Kaiso landing site says currently she is settling at Kaiso Primary School with her five children since she has nowhere to construct another house because her house was completely submerged by floods.



Rashid Sunday, a resident of Sebigoro landing site says he was hit hard by the floods that submerged his house and currently he has nowhere to go.



He wants the government to come to their rescue and allocate part of the Kabwoya-Kaiso-Tonya community wildlife conservation area to resettle them.

The Kabwoya Wildlife Reserve and the Kaiso-Tonya Community Wildlife Area were established following the revision of the protected area estate in Uganda in the late 1990s.



A decree of parliament in 2002 created the two protected areas from the former Kaiso Tonya Controlled Hunting area which had been gazetted in 1963.

The recent rains remind me of how poor our drainage system is. All you have to do is look at the roads every time it rains to know there is something fundamentally wrong with our infrastructure. And the most ridiculous thing about all this is that it has been happening since time immemorial. It is as if we are supposed to learn to live with the floods and normalise them. I have never travelled to other countries so I don’t know whether it is the same case elsewhere.

Do rain floods paralyse movement from one place to another in other countries too or is it just us? Do people have to be carried from one side of the road to another, do cars “drown” in mini rivers? And for those countries that have managed to solve this problem, how did they do it? Can we learn from them? What role can we all play in trying to create a clean and flood-free country?

I know for sure that if we followed a well-organised garbage dumping system, we would not have to deal with the consequences of a clogged drainage system. I also know that if we stopped settling in water catchment areas, we wouldn’t mess up the eco-system and the water would follow a natural drainage flow. What I don’t know is why we don’t do these things and yet continue to cry foul.

Every so often we wake up to huge factories built in what we all know to be swampy areas and yet we say nothing.

I wonder who we think will speak up for us. We have abused our environment way too much to expect any favours from nature.

There’s a song by the Swedish pop group, Ace of Bace titled, Everytime it rains. The chorus of that song says, “Cause every time it rains, I fall to pieces. So many memories the rain releases, I feel you, I taste you. I cannot forget. Every time it rains, I get wet”.

Well, here is a Ugandan rendition of those lines. “Every time it rains, Uganda falls to pieces. So much sewage and dirt and all manner of garbage the rain releases. We smell it, we are even doused in it, every time it rains.

Seriously though, we must do something about our drainage system and put an end to this man-made mess.

Despite rain reducing in most parts of the country, many others continue to experience devastating effects of floods.

The raging floods have claimed about 20 lives and left thousands homeless. The worst hit are eastern, northern and western parts of the country.

In western region, Kasese District has experienced back-to-back floods after five major rivers burst their banks, sweeping away homes, schools, hospitals, and churches.

The recent episode was on May 21 when rivers Thaku and Lhubiriha burst their banks near the Uganda-DR Congo border, killing eight people.

The Kasese District environment officer, Mr Augustine Kooli, said the rainfall pattern in the area was the highest in April and May more than any other time of the year.

“The district experiences a bimodal rainfall pattern. The first rains are short but fall with high intensity and occur between March and May, and the longer rains from August to November have a low intensity,” he explained.

He added: “Annual rainfall ranges from 800mm to 1,600mm and is greatly influenced by altitude. At the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains, the rainfall amount is between 1,200mm and 1,400mm.” Mr Kooli explained that under the District Integrated Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan 2017-2020, they encouraged the communities to plant trees on mountain slopes to reduce the runoff.

Western region

In Isingiro District, five people died in Kabuyanda Town Council and Kabuyanda Sub-county on May 2 following heavy rain, according to Isingiro South MP Alex Byarugaba.

The rain also triggered landslides and floods in the hilly area characterised by deep valleys. “We have always experienced these catastrophes but this time the impact was far too great; I had never seen this extent of damage by rains,” Mr Byarugaba said on Monday.

The floods and landslides destroyed houses, banana plantations, vegetable gardens, fishponds, roads and bridges.

Mr Byarugaba added that more than 800 households of between 4,000 and 5,000 people were affected in Kikagati and Kabuyanda Town Council, while bridges in Kaburara, Rwabisheri, Kabumba, and Kamwotsya were destroyed. “These are crossing points within these sub-counties, connecting health centres, schools and markets. People now can’t easily access these places. Local leaders have mobilized people who just worked on temporary measures for crossing,” he remarks.

In Kanungu District, the area vice chairman, Mr Gad Byomuhangi, on Monday said most roads and bridges were destroyed by rain and yet they do not have money to work on them.

The Kisoro District chairperson, Mr Abel Bizimana, said Rubuguri-Katojo road was cut off after Rushaga Bridge was washed away by floods.

He added that Ruhezamyenda Bridge that connects Rubuguri-Kisoro Town road was also washed away and local people have resorted to using community paths to connect to either side.

In eastern Uganda, floods mostly hit Manafwa, Kween, Bududa, Sironko, Pallisa, Butaleja, and Bukedea districts.

In Pallisa, more than 30 families were displaced at the beginning of the month after floods swept away their homes and gardens.

In Kween District, landslides killed three people and displaced about 50 families in Chepsukunya Town Council and Ngenge Sub-county.

In Budaka District, hundreds are stranded with nowhere to sleep after a heavy storm hit several villages.

Northern region

In Lango Sub-region, more than 350 households in Apac District have been left homeless.

The affected are residents of Acholi Inn Landing Site, Kayei Landing Site, Wansolo Landing Site, and Kampala Kagoi, all in Akokoro Sub-county.

The flash floods also affected residents of Aganga, Tarogali and Alworoeng parishes in Ibuje Sub-county.

Overflowing water from Lake Kyoga and River Nile is currently invading dry land along the shorelines every day, submerging homes and gardens of crops.

The Apac Resident District Commissioner (RDC), Ms Beatrice Akello Akori, said a team from the district visited the affected areas last week to assess the damage and is compiling a report that will be sent to the Office of the Prime Minister. “We are looking at resettling them at Maruzi Ranch but these people are very tricky; once you give them land, they don’t want to leave it,” she said.

In Busoga Sub-region, increasing water levels on Lake Victoria have displaced about 4,000 residents at Masese Landing Site, Rippon and Gomba, all in Jinja Municipal Council.

The councillor representing Masese at Jinja Municipal Council, Mr Ronald Katongole, said there is a need to relocate all people at Masese Landing site. “We (local leaders) have tried to do what is necessary to ensure that people are safe but due to this pandemic, sometimes people turn violent that implementing some of the health directives is challenging,” he said.

Central region

In Masaka District, increasing water levels at landing sites on Lake Victoria shoreline have started extending to villages, sparking fear among residents.

By last week, the floods had swept through Makonzi Parish, Bukakata Sub-county, displacing 450 households across five villages of Kasaka, Bwami, Bukoko, Kisuku and Makonzi .

The floods first submerged the landing sites of Lambu, Kaziru, Kisuku, Malembo and Kachanga, forcing about 20,000 people to relocate to safer places on the mainland where they have since set up makeshift houses.

Although government has extended them some relief assistance such as food and tarpaulins, the victims are still in dire need of more humanitarian assistance.

Bukakkata Sub-county chairperson Aloysius Jjuko said no deaths have been recorded though residents are at high risk of contracting water -borne diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera and Hepatitis A due to the deteriorating sanitation situation in the area.

“Our focus has been on those displaced from landing sites but the problem has escalated, residents have lost houses and crops and government should assist them as well,” he said The Resident District Commissioner, Mr Herman Ssentongo, said area leaders have been tasked to identify free government land where victims can permanently be resettled. “This tragedy is unprecedented and as government we cannot leave our people to continue suffering; a lasting solution has to be found,” he said.

Kalangala cut off

In Kalangala, flash floods have also caused similar havoc, cutting off three landing sites and separating them from the main Bugala Island. The affected landing sites are Kaazi-Malanga, Mukalanga and Kasamba in Bujumba Sub-county.

Access to the three landing sites from Bugala Island has been by road but currently, residents have to use boats to connect to the area. Mr Federico Ssekatawa, the chairperson Kaazi- Malanga Village, said life on the ‘new island’ has become very difficult as residents lack food, clean water and medical supplies.

Currently, an estimated 7,500 residents in the area have no access to electricity supply after the devastating floods forced the service provider, Kalangala Infrastructure Services, to disconnect power lines to avoid electrocution.

• Torrential rains are being experienced across Uganda. According to the Uganda National Meteorological Department (UNMA), abovenormal rains will continue until the end of the year.

• At least 38 people have died due to floods and landslides in Bundibugyo, Bududa and Sironko districts, and over 150 people have been injured. At least 300,000 have been affected and an estimated 65,000 people are displaced, according to Government sources.

• The floods and landslides have left a trail of destruction, including damaged homes, infrastructure, agriculture and livelihoods.

• The Government of Uganda, with the support of humanitarian partners, is responding to the most urgent needs of people affected.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

Due to heavier than normal rains since September—enhanced by the positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)—several districts in Uganda have been experiencing flash floods (mostly in urban areas) and landslides (in rural/hilly areas).

According to preliminary estimates from a rapid assessment conducted by the Office of the Prime Minister in the most affected sub-regions of Mount Elgon and South Western Uganda in early December, at least 300,000 people have been affected, including 65,000 people reportedly displaced by the impact of heavy rains since September 2019. Over 21,500 hectares of crop and plantations are reportedly damaged in these areas. As of 17 December, 38 people have reportedly lost their lives, including in the mountainous Bundibugyo district in the western region and the Mount Elgon area in eastern Uganda. Water systems in Bundibugyo have been destroyed, exacerbating the risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases. In the week of 16 December, three suspected cholera cases were reported in Bundibugyo district. However, they tested negative and there have been no confirmed cholera cases since November 2019, according to the Ministry of Health and WHO.

In the eastern lowland sub-regions of Teso and Bukedea sub-regions, thousands of people have been affected and hectares of crops destroyed. Damage to infrastructure, including roads and bridges, has been reported in the hilly south-western parts of Kigezi and Ruwenzori, the low-lying district of Ntoroko, the central sub-region of Buganda, western sub-regions of Ankole and Bunyoro, and northern sub-regions of Acholi, and Karamoja regions. This has hampered access to affected communities. Districts along the banks of the River Nile in West Nile sub-region have also suffered losses of crops and destroyed and damaged homes due to flooding.","Thu, 19 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1429368-ROSEA_20191219_Uganda_Floods_FlashUpdate%231.png?itok=t_WNKUX8,"['landslides', 'reportedly', 'western', 'flash', 'subregions', '2019', 'update', 'affected', 'rains', 'floods', 'uganda', 'including', 'bundibugyo', '19']",

Documents filed at the EAC Council of Ministers say Uganda has refused to execute a new policy governing the release of water in Jinja, a decision that has led to flooding of the lake that could claim more lives and cause destruction.

The council ordered EAC member states to implement the policy in 2012, but over four years, despite protests by Uganda.

Kenya, Tanzania and Burundi voted for its implementation at a Council of Ministers meeting that year.

Uganda insists that the policy, which determines volumes of water to be released based on Lake Victoria levels, cannot be implemented as it does not take into consideration several factors, like extraction in the affected countries.

Life and death

The policy is yet to be implemented. “The 26th EAC Council of Ministers directive on the policy has taken more than four years to implement, not only by Uganda, but also by the partner state,” Uganda says in its appeal to the council.

“Studies that had been directed to be completed by November 2014 have never started. Uganda is, therefore, of the view that the policy cannot be implemented and needs review.”

Nalubaale dam was built as part of a hydropower station in Jinja after Uganda and Egypt signed agreements that the East African country would not do anything to interfere with the flow of the Nile, the world’s longest river.

However, power station operators have, over the years, increased or reduced the volumes of water flowing from the lake based on how much is needed to meet the East African country’s electricity demand.

The release of too much water means Lake Victoria’s depth will decrease, a situation blamed on drought for many years.

Releasing less water means the level of the lake increases and could lead to floods in towns and villages surrounding it.

Floods killed at least six people and displaced 32,000 in Kisumu County and its environs in April and May. Ugandan authorities want the original natural flow out of the lake maintained.

The regional bloc ordered implementation of the schedule after it emerged that Uganda had been violating agreements to maintain the natural Lake Victoria outflow volumes before Nalubaale dam was built.

Mitigation measures

Uganda says the studies that led to the policy failed to consider major water extractions in the three countries.

It adds that the EAC Council of Ministers ordered the implementation of the policy before more data and information on water extraction in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania had been collected, yet that was recommended by experts whose reports were used in formulating it.

“The developed and adopted blueprint is therefore only a release policy and not a release and abstraction one,” Uganda says in its appeal.

“Potential impacts of the policy in Lake Victoria Basin countries as well as downstream states was not carried out to provide mitigation measures for a win-win situation as directed by the Council of Ministers.”

“Uganda has more than 600 kilometres of River Nile across her territory that includes lakes Kyoga and Albert. It has made significant developments based on the agreed curve policy that came into existence in 1954, which will be affected by the new water release and abstraction policy.”

The construction of Nalubaale hydroelectric power station in 1954 provided a reliable source of electricity for Uganda, but the decision has come to haunt hundreds of thousands of families living around the lake.

Before the construction of Nalubaale, the Owen and Ripon waterfalls were the main links between Lake Victoria and the Nile.

The waterfalls also acted as a natural tap, controlling the Nile and Lake Victoria outflows. After signing the agreements with Egypt, Uganda built Owen Falls dam, later renamed Nalubaale.

Preparations for building the giant dam and power station meant that Ripon Falls was to be excavated.

Moderating factor

Eventually, Nalubaale was submerged but Ripon Falls remained.

But as Uganda celebrated its increased electricity supply capacity, it was the beginning of problems for millions of people around areas touched by the lake in the three countries.

Since the commissioning of Nalubaale in 1959, its operators have either increased or reduced Lake Victoria outflows, depending on volumes required for the production of electricity.

When more water is needed to meet growing power demands, operators allow more water to flow out of Victoria, which in turn leads to lower levels in the lake.

Whenever rain falls heavily, Nalubaale has sufficient water. It means less water is released, increasing levels in Lake Victoria in turn.

To increase power production and utilise excess water spills from Nalubaale, Uganda built another dam called Kiira just a kilometre away. President Yoweri Museveni commissioned it in 2003.

In 2005, World Bank senior disaster risk management specialist Daniel Kull led a study that showed that Uganda released more than 50 per cent of the allowed water volumes from Nalubaale and Kiira dams over the previous two years.

Fish population

Mr Kull’s team also found that the drastic fall in Lake Victoria water levels at the time was more as a result of the releases in Jinja than drought as had been widely believed.

“Based on the results of this analysis, it must be concluded that the severe Lake Victoria drops occurring in 2004 and 2005 were about 45 per cent due to drought and 55 per cent due to over-releases from Nalubaale and Kiira dams,” the World Bank disaster risk specialist’s report said.

It added that the rains that followed could not raise the levels of the lake, which was partial evidence that water release had more impact that drought.

Nalubaale dam is operated by Eskom Uganda Ltd — a subsidiary of South Africa’s state-owned Eskom Holdings Ltd.

Eskom has been spilling large volumes of water from Nalubaale and Kiira dams between February and May. The water reached its peak limits after the heavier-than-normal rainfall, leading to floods.

The effects of water releases go beyond flooding. When the water level in the lake drops, it affects the fish population.

As marine creatures move inwards to deeper waters, fishermen follow them. They at times get arrested after ending up in Uganda or Tanzania.

At least 70 Kenyan fishermen were arrested after crossing into Uganda between May and October last year.

They were released after paying heavy fines. Others had their boats confiscated. Some complained of being tortured and beaten by Ugandan security officials.","Fri, 22 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.monitor.co.ug/resource/blob/1891214/b3b31c7a34adabef0a3b28da04b1f481/latest07pix-data.jpg,"['lake', 'policy', 'releasing', 'dam', 'council', 'lvictoria', 'floods', 'uganda', 'water', 'release', 'volumes', 'ugandas', 'nalubaale', 'victoria', 'blamed']",

The continuous rising water level in Lake Kwania has forced thousands of people in Dokolo district from their homes. The water has submerged several homes and gardens over the past three months forcing residents to take shelter in schools, churches and community facilities.



More than 5000 households have been affected in different Sub Counties in Dokolo District. Agwata, Adok, Adeknino and Kwera sub counties are the most affected where the water levels seem to be increasing each day. At least 166 households have been displaced in Agwata Sub County.



The affected families have temporarily moved in with their relatives or friends while others are renting in areas that are not affected by the flooding. At least 20 households have taken shelter at Kachung Junior, a private Primary school.



However, their biggest challenge is lack of clean drinking water. The families are currently depending on the flood water for drinking and domestic chores since the only borehole at the school has been dysfunctional for the past five months. They are also forced to share classrooms and open dormitories.



John Obel, a resident of Kachung Western Ward, says the area is flooded to the point that all their feet is rotting. He says their need small canoes to navigate the area.

Musa Ecweru, minister of state for relief and disaster preparedness, told Xinhua by telephone that torrential rains which started last month, marking the first major rainfall season in the country, have displaced people, destroyed homes, farms, washed away roads and other infrastructure.

He said most of the affected areas include the mountainous and hilly areas in eastern and western Uganda, low lying and plain areas in eastern region.

“This problem is across the whole country. Now there are thousands of people who are displaced. The officers in my office are compiling the figures (numbers of people) and extent of damage for each district across Uganda,” said Ecweru.

“We are going to sit down and see how to handle the magnitude of the problem. We shall see how to dispatch some support to the affected persons,” he said.

The Office of the Prime Minister has been running alert messages, warning that the country will face floods, landslides, strong winds and lightning as the first rain season peaks.

“We have been running alert messages on televisions and radios. These alerts started running about five months ago. We have been telling and warning the country of heavy rains and its dangerous effects,” said Ecweru.

He said landslides have hit the hilly western district of Kabale.

Ecweru said people living in mountainous areas, flood prone areas as well as wetlands should immediately vacate to safe places as heavy rains continue.

At least two children were killed by floods following heavy rains in the western district of Rubanda on Saturday, according to police.

According to the weather department, several parts of the country especially western and eastern regions, are currently experiencing normal to above normal rainfall, with destructive effects.

In its March-May seasonal rainfall outlook, the Uganda National Meteorological Authority warned of enhanced rainfall over several parts of the country that could result into disasters such as landslides and foods, leading to loss of lives and destruction of property in the first major rain season.","Sun, 03 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://africa.cgtn.com/wp-content/photo-gallery/2019/12/gettyimages-629502060-594x594.jpg,"['landslides', 'season', 'rainfall', 'western', 'areas', 'rains', 'floods', 'uganda', 'country', 'thousands', 'heavy', 'affect', 'running']",

More than 150 families in Dei A Village, Panyimur Sub-county in Pakwach District are homeless after their houses were submerged following the rising water levels of Lake Albert.

Mr Nicholas Opar, the village chairperson, said the floods destroyed several houses and washed away crops.

The most affected communities are mainly fishermen from Singla Market, Kayonga and Wangkado in Panyimur Sub-county.

Mr Opar said most of the affected families were temporarily hosted by their relatives while others have sought refuge in nearby government primary schools.

“We are living in fear and anticipate a possible cholera and typhoid outbreak among others that may affect the community who live near the Nile and have occasionally been using the lake as their water source for domestic purposes,” he said.

Mr Shaban Ofoy, the sub-county chairperson, said the situation could create a food crisis in the area.

“We anticipate hunger because huge acres of gardens with crops were washed away,” Mr Kinobe said. He said they had previously warned the communities against settling in the wetlands but they have been hesitant to adhere to the directives because they had no place to relocate to.

Mr Robert Omito, the district chairperson, appealed to government and well-wishers for relief.

“We have notified the [Ministry] of Relief, Disaster and Preparedness, and Uganda Red Cross regional office to assess the level of devastation and come to our rescue urgently and attend to the village,” Mr Omito said.

He added that said since most of the affected families mainly rely on fishing as source of their livelihood, there is urgent need of relief supplies such as food, tents and blankets to temporarily settle the affected families.

Recurrent

In December last year, floods cut off Pakwach-Karuma road, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded. The Uganda National Meteorology Authority, in its “seasonal rainfall outlook for March to May 2020,” warned that there would be an overall increased likelihood of near normal to above normal (wetter than average) rainfall in several parts of the country. Floods have also ravaged other districts, including Kasese, Ntoroko, Bundibugyo, Kabale, Ntungamo and Isingiro.

She's on a mission to raise awareness about the issue within Africa and internationally because she has seen the impacts of climate change already on her own community.

DW: When you started Fridays for Future activism in Uganda, you were very much alone right at the beginning. At what point did you think, 'OK, I should continue this or I'm going to give up'?

Vanessa Nakate: I just felt like I had to continue striking, especially because I was still doing it by myself. But then as time went on, more and more people started to get involved in different parts of the country doing the climate strikes. And also in the entire African continent, more activists started coming up and doing the climate strikes and demanding action. And to me, that is enough of a motivation to keep me doing activism, knowing that I am not doing it alone, and that there are millions of young people from different parts of the world striking and demanding climate action.

How does climate activism in your country differ from what it looks like in Europe? We're used to seeing big Fridays For Future strikes here, but what does it look like in Uganda?

Well, of course there is a big difference between the activism in Uganda and in Europe. This is mainly because of two things.

One is awareness. Many people are not yet aware of the dangers. They don't have the facts. They don't have the clear science about what is happening when it comes to the climate crisis.

And then the other thing is freedom of expression. Freedom of expression is not the same as we see it is in Europe and it's also harder for students here to walk out of school and do the climate strikes.

If I want to do climate strikes with students, I have to go in the schools because many of them, they have a fear of walking out of school. Just walking out would subject you to either suspension or expulsion.

Also getting permits for marches every Friday is very hard, especially if you don't have a strong organization that is behind you, that is supporting you. So activism in my country — or probably in any other African country — is different because of such restrictions.

With that in mind, how do you get people motivated to go on strikes?

By sharing on social media. That is — mainly on Twitter and Facebook — I would share my strikes every Friday and many people would ask questions about what I was doing and why I was doing that.

The other way is going into schools and requesting principals, director of schools to talk to students on Friday so that I get to discuss with them the challenges that our planet faces and their role in securing a better future.

One other way, we've been doing community reach-outs where we go to local communities and do cleanups, because most of these people, they don't have access maybe to a television. They don't watch the news. They don't know the challenges that the world is facing. So through these local reach-outs or doing cleanups, we get to speak to them, we get to explain to them how they can protect the planet, what they can do for our home, because all of us have a responsibility to play.

The Global Strike 4 Climate in Uganda's capital Kampala in 2019

Climate change is obviously a difficult thing to explain to anybody in the world. But for you, what are the main issues locally that you are dealing with?

I have clearly seen the danger that climate change places on people's lives and the danger is mainly an issue of food scarcity and water scarcity for people.

A large percentage of the people in Uganda are heavily dependent on agriculture as a source of survival, and that is mainly the people in the rural communities. It also affects those in the urban centers because they get food from the rural communities. It also brings about other problems of seeing more street children on the streets of Kampala. This is because many of them, they're trying to run away from their lands. They're trying to find a better way of survival.

Also, availability of access to clean water for the people, because when it floods, that means the water will still be contaminated. It's submerged even toilets, not just the farms, it also submerged drainage. That means any water source that the community was relying on was also contaminated by the dirt from the toilets. So you find that, even in the flood there is a water scarcity.

You, as well as I guess your colleagues one could call them from Europe, have a whole set of different agendas regarding what issues are important within Europe, as opposed to what is important across Africa or Asia. Has it ever been difficult working with them?

No. I believe in a way, yes, the demands are different, the urgency is different — when it comes to Europe, it isn't as urgent as it is in Africa with the climate crisis. So in Europe, you find that most of the activists, they are mainly targeting the politicians and the leaders in making decisions that will ensure that different parts of the world are protected, that will ensure that the Earth is protected.

I personally may not have reach to the leaders who determine the existence of the fossil fuel industry, who determine whether we are going to transition to a more sustainable future. Most of those leaders, they have so much influence as well in some of the countries on the African continent. So I feel like if they're able to reach out to those leaders in the European Parliament and put pressure on them to take the decisions that would save our planet, that also helps me out, that also helps the people of my country.

As you point out, places across Africa, whether it's the Sahel, whether it's the coastal areas, they have much more to lose than what we see in Europe. But for you, how does this make you feel when you can see that Africans are actually in a more dangerous position than the Europeans are, but that Africans have so little influence on that?

As a climate activist, of course, I understand that we have tried so much to ask for representation of every activist on the world stage, in discussions. But it is one thing to see that representation, but it's another thing for that representation to carry the same weight.

The weight of influence — it is not the same. The question is: Will they listen to what I will say? Will they find it important if I say it? What if I say the same thing today and no one pays attention to it and another activist from Europe says the same thing and it's given much attention?

What's your message to people across Africa about climate? No pressure.

For the people of Africa, no one is going to fight for you when it comes to the climate crisis.

If Africa experiences issues with the climate crisis, many times, we first look out for international media to talk about it. But now we need African media.

We can only save our continent if we work together. And unfortunately, it's not something that we are seeing right now.

Recently, you've actually been tweeting in German to try and get the message across. What made you do this?

Well, I did that because I was really angry and disturbed by the fact that Germany chose to push coal to 2038. I feel like that helps them and that doesn't help communities that are already being affected by the climate crisis. I feel like 2038 is too late. It's unnecessary and very dangerous for communities that are already facing devastating impacts of climate change.

So tweeting in German was a message to Germany, to the entire world. It was a message saying: 'I am watching you, as an activist. We are watching you and the decisions that you are making, they are not good for us. They are not good for our future. You have to reconsider and understand that we have no time left.'

The year 2020 will, without a shadow of a doubt, be etched into the collective memory of human society for a long, long time. It began with the novel coronavirus emerging out of China’s Wuhan and reaching all corners of Earth. It's only now, with the year coming to an end, that the world has begun its retort against COVID-19 through vaccination drives.

While a majority of the global population remained indoors all year to escape the clutches of the pandemic, natural disasters were out in full force, confronting many parts of the world with a catastrophic double whammy.

Here are five such major natural calamities from across the world in the bleak year that was 2020:

Locust Attacks in East Africa and Asia

Swarms of locusts invade Jaipur, Rajasthan on May 26, 2020. (Bhagirath/BCCL Jaipur)

The 2020 locust outbreak was the worst Kenya has seen in 70 years, and the worst in 25 years for countries like Ethiopia, Somalia, and India. It began in May 2018, when Cyclone Mekunu produced heavy rains over a vast, unpopulated desert in the southern Arabian Peninsula, thereby allowing locusts to breed there undetected. Thereafter, Cyclone Luban in October 2018 exacerbated the locust breeding, enabling three generations of locusts to mass-reproduce over a nine-month period. This led to an 8,000-fold increase in the locust population across the Arabian desert.

These mega-swarms then began migrating as per the wind direction, and by April 2020, the aerial armies had successfully invaded 23 countries—African nations like Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Uganda; Arabian countries like Yemen, Saudi Arabia; Paraguay and Argentina in South America; and South Asian nations such as Iran, Pakistan, and India.

The outbreak in India began in late 2019 and January 2020, with kilometre-wide swarms disrupting lives across ten states—Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Haryana, and Uttarakhand.

Subsequently, the Rajasthan government reported crop damage of 33%, while less than 33% crop damage was reported by the governments of Haryana (6520-hectare area), Madhya Pradesh (4400 ha), Maharashtra (806 ha), Uttar Pradesh (488 ha), and Uttarakhand (267 ha).

Bushfires in Australia

Bushfires in Australia tend to be a regular and widespread occurrence. However, the fires witnessed on the continent last summer—towards the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020—were unusually intense and far more destructive, earning this bushfire season the name ‘Black Summer’. While both natural and manmade causes started these fires, factors like high temperatures, drought conditions, high fuel load (accumulation of fallen bark, leaf litter, small branches), and global warming combined to enhance this disaster.

These raging bushfires led to tremendous destruction across the eastern half of the country, burning an estimated 18.6 million hectares of forests, destroying over 5,900 buildings, and directly killing at least 34 people. A further 445 fatalities were caused due to smoke inhalation, and 65,000 people were displaced, as this disaster affected nearly 80 per cent of Australians one way or another.

The fires also reportedly killed or affected at least 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs, also pushing some threatened species such as the long-footed potoroo, the marsupial, and the Kangaroo Island glossy black cockatoo closer to extinction! These ecological consequences aside, the bushfires also caused tremendous air pollution and carbon emission.

Overall, economists estimate the 2020 bushfires may have cost over 103 billion Australian Dollars in property damage and economic losses, thereby making them Australia's costliest natural disaster to date.

Cyclone Amphan

The year 2020 was another active year in terms of cyclones in the North Indian Ocean, with nine depressions forming in the region and five of them intensifying into cyclonic storms and more. Together, these systems caused damage worth $15.78 billion (one lakh fifty-seven thousand crore rupees), and killed about 269 people.

Advertisement Among these, Amphan—the first super cyclonic storm to have formed in the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 Odisha cyclone—was one of the strongest cyclones to hit India, while also being the costliest cyclone ever recorded in the North Indian Ocean in terms of damage caused.

On May 18, Amphan hit its peak intensity with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 260 km/h (160 mph), and two days later, made landfall over West Bengal. It caused great damage across coastal West Bengal, Odisha, Northeast India, and Bangladesh claiming 128 lives and causing overall destruction worth $13.7 billion (one lakh thirty-seven thousand crore rupees).

A few months later, Cyclone Nivar became the second-most destructive cyclone to hit India in 2020, as it made landfall over Tamil Nadu in late November and caused damage worth $600 million (four thousand crore rupees), killing 14. Other cyclones, namely Nisarga, Gati and Burevi, did cause significant local impacts. But, fortunately, the damages were not as high as Amphan and Nivar.

China Floods

Southern China, particularly the Yangtze basin and its tributaries, was affected by severe floods this year, as heavy rains wreaked havoc across the region during the rainy season between June-September. This disaster also extended to central and eastern China during July, effectively creating the worst flood situation the region has experienced since at least 1998. A total of 443 rivers were flooded nationwide, with 33 of them swelling to the highest levels ever recorded!

As per the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), a spike in rainfall activity—caused by climate change-induced rise in vapours emergence from the Indian and Pacific oceans—led to the flooding. Furthermore, anthropogenic factors like the reclamation of lakes and wetlands, urban development, and mass-disappearance of lakes also helped escalate the events.

By August, the floods had killed at least 219 people across the country, affected about 63.46 million people, and damaged 54,000 houses, 76 key national cultural relics, and 187 provincial cultural heritage sites. Overall, the disaster caused a direct economic loss of 178.96 billion CNY.

The destruction in China aside, the release of water from these swollen rivers may also have contributed to the flooding that occurred in adjoining India’s northeastern state of Assam during this period.

Assam Floods

Monsoon floods are a common occurrence for northeast India. But, the year 2020’s Indian monsoon season was particularly difficult for Assam, as the state remained constantly flooded due to persistent spells of heavy rainfall and above-average seasonal precipitation in the region.

The initial flooding began with heavy showers in May, and it wasn’t until October that the statewide situation began to improve. By then, however, the floods had already affected over 50 lakh residents across 30 districts and 5,474 villages, killed 123 and forced over 1.5 lakh people to seek refuge in 627 relief camps and 1662 relief distribution centres set-up by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA). The floods also induced landslides, which further claimed 26 more lives.

Floods also exacerbated the spread of novel coronavirus in Assam, with the state recording over 2 lakh confirmed COVID-19 cases in this period. Stagnant waters and lack of access to clean water, hygiene supplies are also believed to have caused a spike in dengue, malaria, and Japanese encephalitis cases.

The inundation and subsequent landslides damaged bridges, government buildings, roads, embankments, and schools while putting at least 2.67 lakh hectares of crops to ruin. The flooding also affected the wildlife within the state, with more than 45,000 domesticated animals forced to flee or be abandoned, more than 150 wild animals rescued from the Kaziranga National Park, and 125 animals in the park, including 12 rhinoceros, succumbing to the floodwaters.

KAMPALA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people have been displaced as a result of heavy rains, which triggered floods and landslides and caused havoc in several parts of Uganda, a top government official said on Sunday.

Musa Ecweru, minister of state for relief and disaster preparedness, told Xinhua by telephone that torrential rains which started last month, marking the first major rainfall season in the country, have displaced people, destroyed homes, farms, washed away roads and other infrastructure.

He said most of the affected areas include the mountainous and hilly areas in eastern and western Uganda, low lying and plain areas in eastern region.

""This problem is across the whole country. Now there are thousands of people who are displaced. The officers in my office are compiling the figures (numbers of people) and extent of damage for each district across Uganda,"" said Ecweru.

""We are going to sit down and see how to handle the magnitude of the problem. We shall see how to dispatch some support to the affected persons,"" he said.

The Office of the Prime Minister has been running alert messages, warning that the country will face floods, landslides, strong winds and lightning as the first rain season peaks.

""We have been running alert messages on televisions and radios. These alerts started running about five months ago. We have been telling and warning the country of heavy rains and its dangerous effects,"" said Ecweru.

He said landslides have hit the hilly western district of Kabale.

Ecweru said people living in mountainous areas, flood prone areas as well as wetlands should immediately vacate to safe places as heavy rains continue.

At least two children were killed by floods following heavy rains in the western district of Rubanda on Saturday, according to police.

According to the weather department, several parts of the country especially western and eastern regions, are currently experiencing normal to above normal rainfall, with destructive effects.

In its March-May seasonal rainfall outlook, the Uganda National Meteorological Authority warned of enhanced rainfall over several parts of the country that could result into disasters such as landslides and foods, leading to loss of lives and destruction of property in the first major rain season.

Seventeen people are confirmed dead in the south western region of the country, and a child is still missing.

Speaking to RFI Emmanuel Okecho, a Disaster Protect Officer with Uganda's Office of the Prime Minister explained “the south-west in flood prone because of naturally low-lying areas and marshes.”

Bridges and roads have been submerged by the heaviest rainfall to hit Uganda in over 25 years, complicating relief and rescue efforts.

“The floods have caused millions of shillings worth of damage,” Monica Azuba, Uganda’s Transport Minister, told RFI by telephone from Kampala adding, “the government is prioritising the humanitarian situation before assessing the full extent of infrastructural damage.”

The government dispatched an assessment team on Monday, and the Red Cross are leading search and rescue efforts in the east and south west of the country.

Scores of people are unaccounted for after mudslides engulfed homes killing at least eight people in the foothills of Mount Elgon over the weekend. This, despite concerted efforts by the government and environmental organisations to combat deforestation.

East Africa has been hit by torrential rains in recent weeks unleashing deadly flooding in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania and now Uganda. Two million people have been affected.

“These floods are worse than in 2010 because it has been raining almost constantly for two months,” says Okecho.

The rains are expected to continue at least until the end of December.

December 09, 2019 09:45 AM

KAMPALA - Ugandan authorities say the death toll from a week of floods and mudslides has risen to 36 people and left thousands stranded after heavy rains swept across a mountainous region.

A week of heavy rains caused floods and mudslides in Eastern Uganda’s Bugisu and Bundibugyo regions near Rwenzori Mountain.

Authorities say the flooding has taken a toll with the loss of life and property, and with thousands more left stranded.

The Ugandan Red Cross’s Irene Nakasita says search and rescue operations in the regions are hampered as most roads have been washed away.

“And the decision has been taken to put up a transit shelter until the situation normalizes. So, most likely Bubukwang transit center is going to house close to 700 people who are displaced in Bundibugyo,” she said.

Meanwhile, Uganda’s State Minister for Disaster Preparedness and Relief Musa Ecweru says there are concerns about water-borne disease outbreaks in flood-affected areas.

“Now, there’s a risk of contamination of water and if that is not handled well, then we are going to risk another phase of a challenge, an outbreak of cholera which will compound our humanitarian intervention,” he said.

Ecweru says the government has released $5.4 million for emergency drugs to treat water-borne diseases, inflatable boats, tarps, blankets, food, and repairing bridges.

Ugandan authorities say the flooding is expected to recede in January as the weather improves.

Scientists have long warned that rising ocean temperatures are making seasonal rains more severe and more frequent.

The United Nation’s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) last week (Dec 4) said unusually heavy rainfall and flooding in East Africa has affected over 2.8 million people and left at least 280 dead.

UNOCHA said the unusually heavy rainfall was driven by the differences in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the Indian Ocean.

The UN office said rains were expected to diminish in the weeks ahead but heavy rains would likely persist into December and intensify in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.","Mon, 09 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['continue', 'heavy', 'ugandas', 'say', 'week', 'waterborne', 'ugandan', 'rains', 'floods', 'uganda', 'flooding', 'death', 'toll', 'unusually', 'left', 'rises']",

Currently, Kanyangeya primary school is hosting over 98 households. The area LCI chairperson, Deogracious Isemamba said the school premises and toilets are now being used by a large community.

KASESE - Following the outbreak of floods and landslides that ravaged several areas of mountainous Kasese district, residents continue to express worry over the next course of education after several schools were washed away.

Allan Kambale a resident of Namuhuga ward in Bulembia said schools such as Bulembia primary school, Kilembe and Royal ranges secondary schools, were greatly affected by the floods, whereas others cannot be accessed after several roads and bridges were damaged.

Currently, Kanyangeya primary school is hosting over 98 households. The area LCI chairperson, Deogracious Isemamba said the school premises and toilets are now being used by a large community.

""Even if the school lock-down is lifted soon, pupils will have nowhere to study from unless an alternative area is gazetted for resettlement,"" Isemamba reasoned.

Similar concerns were raised by Rehema Aryema who decried the inevitable pressure on surviving school-premises, saying, learners are bound to meet a big challenge on how to resume studies when the lock-down is lifted.

In May this year, Kasese was hit by disastrous floods. The floods started on May 7 and peaked on the morning of May 10. Another disaster followed on May 21, in areas of Mpondwe-Bwera, where flash floods and landslides further destroyed bridges and infrastructure, leading to the death of more than 10 people.

The current flooding started with river Nyamwamba bursting its banks in areas of Kasese municipality sweeping away Kyanjuki-Katiri bridge and Kilembe mines hospital infrastructure. Simultaneous floods also occurred along rivers of Lhubiriha in Bukonzo west with impacts in the sub-counties of Kitholhu, Karambi and Mpondwe-Lhubiriha town council while river Nyamugasani in Bukonzo East had impacts in the Sub-counties of Kyondo, Kyarumba and Kisinga.

River Mubuku floods, on the other hand, had impacts on the communities of Maliba, Bugoye and Karusandara. Equally affected, were town councils of Ibanda-Kyanya, Kisinga and Mubuku.

Health services still a challenge

Asinet Kabugho recounts the incident of flooding which left several communities cut-off from each other. Some pregnant mothers remained stuck up in the hilly areas and couldn't access medical services.

""The situation was only mitigated by a certain group of volunteers who transported affected people in ambulances,"" Kabugho recollects.

After the nearest Kilembe mines hospital premises were damaged by floods, medical services were shifted to premises of St. Micheal Kindergarten and at Catholic social centre (Karitus hall) in Kasese town.

Dr Edward Wefula the hospital superintendent calls for an urgent alternative water source, mortuary, incinerator, placenta pit and more toilets, saying, the new premises were not designed for a hospital.

However, Sr. Teopista Basemera the Kilembe hospital senior administrator, expressed hope of having more structures with a 200-bed capacity.

Malteser International a worldwide humanitarian relief agency, through the prime minister's office and the ministry of health, committed relief and recovery aid worth sh868m for the period of 3months since May 12.

According to Laura Beutler the technical coordinator for emergency medical services under Malteser, as of May 13, over 39,000 people had been affected by the floods.

""We have made more than 1,317 transferals out of which, 171 babies were successfully delivered from complicated pregnancies,"" noted Laura, adding that, eight of the born babies, were delivered from within ambulances.

She hence expressed a need to build capacity in pre-hospital care, where a formidable team of residents and health workers can be trained to administer first aid before or while transferring a patient to the hospital.

For over 3months of rescue and providing relief support, Malteser trained and passed out 23 Kasese residents in providing emergency medical services among which include, first aid and ambulance operations.

""We are striving to establish an Emergency Medical Services project in Kasese so that people can respond by themselves and activate support in an immediate and structured way,"" noted Laura.

She, however, expressed fear over the possible outbreak of diseases especially the COVID-19. She said the preventive measures are largely missing at all settlement camps.

The population of the people in camp is high, the implementation of the COVID-19 SOPs is hard. Social distancing and hand washing are hard to implement.","Mon, 03 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['worried', 'health', 'medical', 'areas', 'kilembe', 'victims', 'services', 'kasese', 'affected', 'floods', 'uganda', 'premises', 'school', 'hospital', 'education']",

KAMPALA, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan government has released 20 billion shillings (about 5.5 million U.S. dollars) for emergency response after deadly landslides and floods hit parts of the east African country.

Musa Ecweru, minister of state for relief, disaster preparedness and refugees told reporters here on Friday that the funds have been released under the 'life-saving and rescue' phase to address the landslides situation in the mountainous areas and in flooding areas.

At least four people were killed, five injured and over 6,000 people displaced on Tuesday after landslides triggered by torrential rains hit the three villages of Namasa, Naposhi and Shukururu in the eastern district of Bududa.

In neighboring Sironko district, four people including two children were killed while 4,000 others were displaced and plantations, livestock lost after multiple landslides and floods hit Nabodi village, Zesui sub county on Tuesday, according to the Office of the Prime Minister.

Ecweru said the funds will be used for procurement of relief food, tarpaulins, blankets, drugs for water borne diseases, inflatable boats and culverts for fixing washed away bridges.

""Post disaster needs assessment will be conducted in January 2020 to determine total level of damage and losses and actions for the recovery and reconstruction,"" he said.

Ecweru said a rapid assessment conducted in the most affected mountainous districts of Bududa, Sironko, Manafwa, Namisidwa and Mbale puts the number of displaced persons at 25,000 while some 85,000 households were affected and 21,500 hectares of crop and plantation damaged.

At least 55,000 people have been displaced and over 120,000 hectares of crops destroyed by floods in the low lying Teso and Bukedi sub regions also in the eastern part of the country.

Ecweru said the northwestern part of the country has equally suffered losses of crop and homes to flooding following high water levels on River Nile.

Other parts of the country, according to the minister, have also suffered some considerable losses due to the ongoing torrential rains.","Fri, 06 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",,"['landslides', 'deadly', 'torrential', 'releases', 'govt', 'hit', 'funds', 'displaced', 'losses', 'floods', 'uganda', 'emergency', 'sub', 'suffered', 'water', 'xinhua']",

• Delayed and below-average cumulative rainfall has delayed planting by at least three weeks in northern and parts of eastern Uganda. Near-average rainfall is forecasted in May and will likely support the development of late-maturing crops. However, the timing of the first season cereal and legume harvests will likely be delayed through early July, and aggregate production is expected to vary by subregion depending on the local amount and distribution of rainfall. Subnational production deficits are likely in northern and eastern Uganda, where rainfall may not be spread evenly in the crop cycle.

• Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes are expected through at least September in most bimodal areas, driven by carryover stocks from 2020, below-average staple food prices, seasonal agricultural labor income during the March to May planting season, and the anticipated average harvest in July. However, Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are likely among households in flood-affected areas and some urban areas, where livelihood activities were significantly disrupted in 2020 and income sources are still below pre-pandemic levels.

• In Karamoja, an increasing number of households face widening food consumption gaps and are utilizing negative livelihoods coping strategies, increasing the share of the population that is experiencing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. While food prices are generally stable and below average in most reference markets, the casual labor wage and the price of firewood, charcoal, and goats are declining, resulting in significantly below-average terms of trade and reduced household purchasing power. Below-average rainfall to date resulted in limited on-farm labor opportunities and delayed land preparation and planting, while others lack access to seeds.

• Planned and funded food assistance (cash and in-kind) equivalent to a 60 percent ration has sustained Crisis! (IPC Phase 3!) outcomes in April. Thereafter, an anticipated pipeline break in food assistance funding may result in further reductions in rations and food security outcomes. Refugees with arable plots are engaging in plowing and planting activities, though some lack access to inputs like seeds as others have yet to recover from the impacts of earlier COVID-19 movement restrictions on food and income sources.

By Stephen Otage More by this Author

The Ministry of Water and Environment has warned all people living on river banks and lakeshores to vacate before impending floods expected from the current rising water levels.

Dr Florence Grace Odongo, the director for water resources management at the Ministry of Water and Environment, said the water level on Lake Victoria, has risen to 13.4 meters, which is only short of 8cm to reach the levels of last year and yet the rain season has just started.

“Lake Victoria is getting full and the only way water exits it is through the River Nile, which drains into Lake Kyoga and Lake Albert that empty it but all these are also getting full of water. The only thing we are going to see is flooding of River Banks and Lake Shores,” she said.

Dr Odongo was on Monday presenting her ministry’s performance in the implementation of the 2016 NRM Manifesto in Kampala on Monday.





Water levels

Dr Odongo explained that from last year’s experience where the water level on Lake Victoria hit 13.48 meters, the highest in 124 years, the situation is not looking good. This is because, she said, Lake Victoria basin traps water from Rwanda, Tanzania, DR Congo, Kenya, Tanzania and all the rain in Uganda yet the underground water system is full because of encroachment on wetlands and forests.

Mr Willis Bashasha, the director in-charge of the Manifesto Implementation Unit, noted that much as the ministry has performed well in increasing access to water and sanitation services across the country, it has done little to contain encroachment and destruction of forests and wetlands across the country.

Mr Sam Cheptoris, the minister of Water and Environment, admitted that much as they promised to increase wetland coverage from 10 per cent in 2016 to 12.4 per cent in 2021, it currently stands at 8.9 per cent due to increased population pressure. He attributed this to low enforcement of the existing laws.

“We have very few enforcement officers under the environment police. Under the 2019 Environment Act, we were supposed to recruit our own force like the Uganda Wildlife Authority but unfortunately, we do not have command over the Environmental Police to protect wetlands and forests,” Mr Cheptoris said.

The Environmental Protection Police Unit was created in December 2011 to support the Ministry of Water and Environment in enforcing environmental laws and regulations.

On Monday, the ministry was among the four ministries, which presented how they implemented the promises the ruling government made to Ugandans during the 2016 election campaigns. Other ministries are those of Science Innovations and Technology, Agriculture and Public Service.

Government has ordered all people living in flood-prone areas around Lake Victoria to relocate to safer areas as the country continues to receive heavy rain.

Mr Raphael Magyezi, the Minister for Local Government, asked district authorities to make arrangements and ensure that people swiftly vacate the affected landing sites on the lake shores.

“Heavy rains have already caused floods in some parts of the country and it is upon the victims with the help of district leaders to vacate flood prone areas for their safety,” Mr Magyezi said in an interview on Wednesday.

Last year, thousands of people were displaced after the rising water levels submerged a number of landing sites and islands around Lake Victoria and Lake Albert.

The victims were temporarily housed in makeshift shelters on the mainland as they waited for government to resettle them.

However, before government implemented the planned resettlement plan, many victims started returning to the islands and landing sites, claiming that the resettlement programme had delayed.

“The government’s plan to resettle the victims is underway although we have been constrained by lack of funds. However, people should not wait for floods to sweep them away. Let them relocate to safer places to save their lives,” Mr Magyezi said.

Masaka District alone has close to 20,000 flood victims, who were left homeless after water submerged Lambu, Kaziru, Kisuku, Malembo, and Kachanga landing sites last year.

Mr Aron Ahikiriza, a fisherman at Bukakkata Landing Site in Masaka District, said although the water levels are rising again, the lake remains their only source of livelihood.

“We can decide to sleep in rented houses far away from the landing site like we did the whole of last year but we cannot completely abandon the landing site because this where we earn a living,” he said.

Mr Rashid Babu, the manager of Mpongo Company Limited, which manages Lambu Landing Site, said government should expedite the process to permanently resettle the victims.

“Government should not be just talking, let them walk the talk because these people have been patient ever since they were promised to be resettled,” he said.

Mr Aloysius Jjuko, the chairperson of Bukakkata Sub-county, said the fishermen and their families are already scared of the rising water levels.

“We ask President Museveni to provide a permanent solution to the flood victims at landing sites. These people cannot resettle themselves unless they are helped by government,” he said.

Issue

Last year, rising water levels in various areas on Lake Victoria, Lake Kyoga, and Lake Albert shorelines wreaked havoc on many landing sites in the districts of Wakiso, Masaka, Mpigi, Kyotera, Kalangala, Mukono, Buikwe, Buvuma, Mayuge, Kayunga, Nakasongola, and Ntoroko displacing more than 40,000 people.

In Kasese District more than 100,000 people were displaced after major rivers in the area including Nyamwamba, Mubuku, Nyamughasana, and Lhubiriha burst their banks.

Susan Afoyocan’s fear of losing her restaurant business started when she saw the first drops of rain.

It was at the onset of the rainy season last month, as the farming communities eagerly began preparing their gardens that she knew she had to do something about these warning signs. Last year, around the same time, heavy rains destroyed Afoyocan’s local eatery and washed away her fruit stall in the process.

And now the 33-year-old was determined to protect her source of livelihood as she set about renovating and remodeling her restaurant as a measure to mitigate the floods.

“I know what happens when it rains here heavily…” Afoyocan, a mother of three, said as she instructed local laborers who were busy carrying tin roofs for covering her restaurant.

“I have to act very fast now or else I will lose everything again.”

As climate changes continues to take toll on Uganda –and globally— the adverse effects of the extreme weather—characterized by erratic rains and raging floods—have triggered growing concerns from climate activists and civil society organization (CSOs) who blame the government of failing to build infrastructures and enforcing preventing policies (such as tree planting along river banks and flood plains to act as a drag on flood waters) that protect disaster–prone areas like Elegu.

The business community operating at the border town have for years continuously battled the raging floods, especially during the rainy season. River Unyama, a nearby water course which often bursts its banks, has also on many occasion not spared the low-lying border town whenever it rains heavily. In November last year, more than 700 people were displaced by floods, and eight others killed, leaving 2,000 acres of crops destroyed following heavy rains in the marshy border town.

Revenue washed away

And now local leaders are accusing the government of making ‘empty promises’ instead of addressing the problem urgently. In 2018, government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Trade and Industries for the 18 billion shillings-project meant to mitigate floods in Elegu. The project, funded by Trade Mark East Africa, was meant to widen the banks of River Unyama to improve the drainage system at Elegu Town.

But four years later, nothing has been done except for only the feasibility study that was carried out by an engineering team at the construction site.

“We were promised air and now the rains are back [again],” said Bosco Onen who works at a retail shop. “For how long shall we wait while we suffer?”

Elegu, a border town with a population of close to 12,000 people, is the biggest revenue earner for Amuru district. Operations by Amuru’s local government fail to run smoothly due to financial constraints resulting majorly from the low revenue collections from the local businesses that are affected by floods.

‘[Trade ministry officials] are not feeling the pinch of the suffering of our community members whose businesses are affected [by] floods,” said Michael Lakony, Amuru District Chairman, adding, ""[They should] come to our rescue...in making sure that we curb the disaster.”

There is also information deficit regarding the progress of the project. And at moment, the Trade Ministry officials are being accused of being cagey— when it comes to giving out information about the project— by local leaders who claim they’ve been left in the dark for most of the time.

When this reporter contacted Julius Kasirye, the Project Manager for Border Export Zone–BEZ under the Ministry of Trade and Industries for comment, said:” …the matter can only be best responded to by either the Permanent Secretary [of] the Minister of Trade and Industry.”

The Trade Ministry Permanent Secretary didn’t respond to our repeated phone calls either.

But for now, as the rainy season continues to pound on, the business community at Elegu have to remain resilient and survive on their own as they wait for government support. On a recent day, as the clouds began to open up, a group of young women rushed to collect pieces of cassava spread outside on thin plastic paper for sun drying. Nearby, a young mother was busy rebuking some of kids who were playing outside in the middle of the chaos.

""If nothing is done [to help us], we will keep suffering,"" said Afoyocan.","Mon, 26 Apr 2021 15:50:05 GMT",https://www.blackstarnews.com/sites/all/themes/blackstar/favicon.ico,"['project', 'demand', 'mitigate', 'season', 'ministry', 'town', 'border', 'stalls', 'uganda', 'promised', 'elegu', 'rains', 'mega', 'floods', 'traders', 'local', 'trade']", 
4,4,FL-2019-000163-UGA,Battling Rising Water in Uganda's Wetlands - Global Press Journal,https://globalpressjournal.com/africa/uganda/battling-rising-water-ugandas-wetlands/,"KIKUUBE, UGANDA — Standing on the shore of Lake Albert, on Uganda’s western border, Sanyu Sanday looks out past the surf to where her small mud house stands partially submerged in the water. She’s salvaged what she can — her mattress and other possessions sit on a small motorboat — but after living on the lakeshore for the past two years, she’s unsure about where she will go.

“The raging waters have cut us off from what we knew as home,” Sanyu says.

Severe flooding has stricken Uganda in recent years, as changing weather patterns have led to increased rainfall, causing lakes and rivers to swell. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced across the country, particularly in flood-prone areas surrounding Lake Victoria to the south, Lake Albert to the west, and Lake Kyoga in the center of the country. It’s a situation that is likely to become worse as global temperatures rise and people continue to destroy Uganda’s wetlands to build roads, houses and other infrastructure.

Since October 2019, rising temperatures in the Indian Ocean have led to intense and prolonged rainfall in Uganda, causing water levels in Lake Victoria, one of Africa’s Great Lakes, to reach historic highs not seen since the 1960s. This has caused extreme flooding in the Lake Victoria basin.

“Too much rain means too much collected in the basin, which overspills and floods neighboring places,” says George William Omony, a senior meteorologist at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority.

Edna Namara, GPJ Uganda Sanyu Sanday’s mattress and other possessions are loaded in a small motorboat on Lake Albert. Her house, in the background, lies partially submerged in the water.

The government has been working to relocate thousands impacted by the flooding. But people like Sanyu, who built homes in parts of the Lake Victoria basin without obtaining official authorization, haven’t been included in these resettlement plans, according to Jackson Twinomujuni, commissioner of International and Transboundary Water Affairs at the Ministry of Water and Environment.

Achidria Tony, a spokesperson for the National Environment Management Authority, says that while the government can’t stop climate change or the increased rainfall it brings, officials are trying to prepare for rising water levels.

“What we do is ensure natural flood control systems such as wetlands and forests are not degraded and are instead used sustainably,” he says.

Decades ago, Uganda’s wetlands were able to absorb such flooding. But infrastructure development has caused the country’s wetlands to dwindle — from 32,000 square kilometers (12,355 square miles) in 1964 down to 26,308 square kilometers (10,158 square miles) as of 2005, according to the Ministry of Water and Environment.

“In 1961, 1964, the water was contained without alarm, because there was enough forest cover and swamps,” says Twinomujuni, referring to the historic rainfall Uganda experienced in the 1960s. “There were no paved homes and drainage channels, which do not retain any rainwater, but leave it with the only alternative to flow into the lake, hence the rise.”

Edna Namara, GPJ Uganda Nankya Amina points to the flooded ground floor of her house, along the shores of Lake Victoria in Kampala. Uganda’s wetlands have been severely depleted, due to construction and development.

Rising water is a problem in Uganda’s capital city of Kampala as well. Annual damages from flooding, which were less than $10 million in 2013, could increase to between $33 million and $102 million by 2050, according to a report by Wilson Truman Okaka, a lecturer at Kyambogo University in Kampala, who researches climate change.

In 2014, Nankya Amina built a house with rental units in a wetland area within the city’s Makindye division, along the shores of Lake Victoria. She hoped to generate income to help support herself and her six children. By law, property owners must obtain authorization from the National Environment Management Authority before they can build. But Nankya didn’t submit her plans for approval.

“I knew environmentalists would not approve my plot, since it was in the wetland,” Nankya says. “Also, I did not want to spend my money on processing the plan.”

Now she regrets the decision. The ground floor of the house is submerged in water and continues to sink, forcing her to live in a small wooden structure nearby. Even this living situation may be temporary.

“Nankya and 385 households in Makindye West division have to relocate and give back the water its territory,” says Achidria. “We sent out early warnings telling them to move before the floods.”

Sanyu, for her part, has grown accustomed to being uprooted. She initially came to Uganda in 2018 after fleeing violence in her native Democratic Republic of Congo, just across Lake Albert. She has been living in Uganda without legal documents, making money by catching and selling fish, while taking periodic trips back to DRC to check on her aging mother.

She had hoped to remain in the area and find employment cooking for workers coming to labor in the nearby oil fields. With her home destroyed, that future is now in doubt.

“We are turned double refugees,” Sanyu says, “unable to sit in either the host or mother country.”","Sun, 21 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://globalpressjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GPJ-NEWS-UGANDA-EN-DOUBLE-REFUGEES-54_web2048-650x434c.jpg,"['square', 'lake', 'house', 'sanyu', 'wetlands', 'rising', 'uganda', 'water', 'flooding', 'ugandas', 'victoria', 'battling']", 
5,5,FL-2019-000163-UGA,Poor human activities aiding Butaleja floods - Daily Monitor,https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/poor-human-activities-aiding-butaleja-floods-3394406,"By Yahudu Kitunzi More by this Author

Environmental experts and local leaders in Butaleja District have blamed the re-occurrence of floods to massive environmental degradation and lack of a political will to mitigate the effects of such disasters.

The experts say swamps and river banks of Manafwa and Nakwasi have been mismanaged by the locals due to poor agricultural methods.

They also blame the floods on failure by the government to erect embankments on River Manafwa and River Nakwasi and restore flood early warning systems.

The system, which stopped functioning in 2016, had been installed by the government in 2015 to alert locals of the rising water levels.

The concern comes following the occurrence of floods that hit the district on Friday, killing one person, destroying property worth millions of shillings and displacing many residents.

The yet unidentified resident was swept by water as he attempted to cross Nakwasi River in Leresi Cell.

Houses were submerged and household items such as beddings, clothes and crops were washed away by the ravaging floods triggered by the downpour from Mt Elgon. Transport was also paralysed and schools rendered inaccessible.

The most affected areas were Butaleja Town Council and Busolwe Town Council.

When Daily Monitor visited the affected areas, the displaced people were wandering without food, shelter, clothing, among other necessities.

The district has been experiencing back-to-back floods since 1976, and environmentalists further predict that this is likely to continue.

“Environmental degradation is rife in Butaleja District and it has been worsened by the laissez-faire approach to the disaster by authorities,” Mr James Wire, an agribusiness consultant, said.

“As of now, there are no visible efforts at an institutional level to stop this problem and it is worrying,” he added.

Mr Wire said there is a need for the district to enact by-laws that will protect the environment.

“Simple approaches such as requiring a permit before a tree is cut down in public or private land may seem harsh but bear fruits in the long run,” he said, adding that residents should be given seedlings to plant trees on the river banks.

The chairperson of Masulula “B” Village in Himutu Sub-county, Mr Mesulamu Wabaye, said there is limited land and this has forced the populace to encroach on what should be the green spaces, especially the swamps.

Ms Lamula Were, the district senior environmental officer, said the situation has been worsened by locals erecting residential houses on the river banks while others are farming and quarrying near the rivers.

“People should stop digging up to the river banks. Butaleja District is on a low land area,” she said.

Ms Were said about 60 per cent of wetlands in the district have been encroached on. She, however, said the environmental law will not spare those who are encroaching on the wetlands.

She said the district environment office has started implementing a presidential directive to restore wetlands.

Encroachment

Mr Higenyi Kemba, a resident and an opinion leader, said the main cause of the floods is human encroachment.

“Human encroachment around the river banks causes heavy silting that fills up the river bed, hence reducing the size of the waterway. When this happens, the route that water should take becomes shallow,” Mr Kemba said.

Mr Kemba said people should plant bamboo trees on either side of the river banks all the way from Bugisu Sub-region to Butaleja and Bugwere.

“Bamboo trees will stop the silting. When this is done, the deposits already in the river can then be removed...,” he said.

Mr Moses Wegulo, a resident, said repeated floods have affected them, especially in terms of food security and road network.

For example since this year started, the district has been hit by floods four times leaving hundreds of people homeless.

“This road from Mbale-Butaleja-Busolwe, which is the main link between the two districts is always cut off by floods,” he said.

Ms Madina Hifudde, another resident of Butaleja, said the affected families need urgent financial and moral support.

“We appeal to the government and other non-governmental organisations to intervene because the situation is bad,” Ms Hifudde said.

The chairperson-elect for Butaleja District, Mr Michael Higenyi Bory, said about 15,000 families have been affected by floods.

He said the crops destroyed include rice, sweet potatoes and cassava.

“We request the government to intervene and help our people. We need shelter and food,” he said.

The district environmental officer, Mr Tom Wandera, said the district is making an assessment report to submit to the Office of the Prime Minister for assistance to the affected families.

“We ask our people who are in flood-prone areas to relocate to safer places as we wait for any assistance from the government,” Mr Wandera said.

He said they have gazetted Doho Rice Scheme offices and some schools for people who have been displaced.

The Resident District Commissioner, Mr Stanly Bayole, said the government has the political will and it’s aware of the damage caused by floods.

Pupils in the Rwenzori Sub-region, whose classroom blocks and school buildings were swept off by floods in Kasese and Bundibugyo districts, can now smile again after they got new classroom blocks, pit-latrines and other facilities.

The pupils had lost any hope of resuming classes after the reopening of schools by the government.

At Bikone Primary School in Kasese District in May last year, all the classroom blocks were washed away by floods after River Mubuku burst its banks, leaving more than 500 learners stranded with nowhere to study from.

The floods from River Thaku also swept away classrooms at Kisabu Primary School also in Kasese District, leaving more than 300 pupils helpless.

Others affected by floods include Budenge and Bughonga primary schools in Bundibugyo District.

In Ntoroko District, floods from rising water levels of Lake Albert submerged all the classrooms at Umoja, Rwangara and Kachwakumu primary schools.

The new classroom blocks and other facilities were built by Save the Children, a non-governmental organisation.

The head teacher of Bikone Primary School, Mr Shem Tabura, said during lockdown in May last year, all classrooms and school records were destroyed by floods as River Mubuku burst its banks.

“We are now happy because we had lost hope for the future of our pupils as all the classroom blocks were swept away by floods. We did not have any records as text books, PLE result slips from 1989 to 2019, among others were destroyed. We are happy to see that our pupils have resumed school,” he said.

Mr Josephat Muhindo, the head teacher of Kisabu Primary School, said three classroom blocks were swept away by floods.

He said the school currently has 380 learners and have been struggling to accommodate more students.

“Our community members and other stakeholders raised about Shs12 million, which we used to buy land elsewhere to relocate the school because we were advised that where the school was located is not good, but now we have got four new classrooms and pupils are studying comfortably,” Mr Muhindo said.

He said last year in July, officials from the Office of Prime Minister promised to build seven classrooms but up to now they have not received any communication.

Mr Colenelius Masereke, a parent in Ibanda-Kyanya town council, said when floods swept away the school they lost hope about the future of their children to go back to school.

“Some people in the community died in floods and good enough it was lockdown. We did not lose any students. We are happy to see that we got new classrooms for our pupils. We shall wait for the government to make additional infrastructure,” he said.

Mr Muhindo Bagonza Libbum, the project manager of Enabling teacher approach at Save the Children, said with Shs291.4 million, they built four classrooms each at Kisabu and Bikone in Kasese District while in Bundibugyo District, they built latrines at Budenge and Bughonga primary schools.

He said they have also given the affected schools Wash facilities and SOPs, motorcycles, digital cameras, among others.

Floods

Kasese and Bundibugyo districts are prone to floods. In May 2020, rivers Mubuku and Nyamwaba burst their banks, causing floods which displaced many people and destroyed several property.

In Ntoroko District, floods displaced more than 10,000 people in Kanara Sub-county and up to now those displaced remain stranded.

Frightened voices told her, her seven children and their neighbors to run. Heavy rains had soaked western Uganda’s mountainous Kasese region the day before, and now the area’s rivers had burst their banks. Torrents of water rushed into the valley, destroying homes, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure.

Bambu, 37, tried to escape. “I was stuck. The water was to my knees, and my hands held two of my youngest children,” she says. “We held onto whatever we could until help came in the morning.”

Bambu’s house was swept away in the flooding, but she and her children survived. Her husband was not so lucky. “My husband, who was at a bar when it happened, tried to get to us but was injured by a moving log,” she says. “As we could not get medical help in time, he died.”

The Kilembe Mines Hospital, the region’s primary medical center, which serves more than 20,000 residents, would normally have been accessible by an easy 15-minute walk. But the flooding destroyed the hospital and made area roads impassable, cutting off the region from other health care facilities.

Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda Water, rocks and mud swept through the Kilembe Mines Hospital and destroyed the medical center. Staff members were able to evacuate patients, and the hospital has reopened on a provisional basis at a new location.

The flooding affected more than 100,000 people in the region. At least 1,200 were left homeless and 18 were killed, says Godfrey Kabbyanga, mayor of the Kasese Municipal Council.

The dire situation is a consequence of environmental changes, as well as growing political and socioeconomic concerns. As a result, disasters like this are likely to become more common in the years ahead.

“In Kasese, rivers have been known to flood periodically since the 1940s,” says Evelyn Mugume, environment officer for the Kasese municipality. Climate change is causing snow in the mountains to melt, she says, increasing the frequency and severity of the flooding. Local residents also have been illegally building homes and farms along the banks of River Nyamwamba, one of the main rivers in the region, making the land too unstable to control the floodwaters.

“Areas along the riverbanks are supposed to be managed by government, but people have got to own plots there,” Mugume says. “They have degraded this land, because not all of them know how to manage it. Politicians use lip service to protect illegal occupants. They do not advocate enough for environment protection.”

The government has put forward plans to restore the riverbanks by constructing barriers to protect infrastructure and calling on residents to plant bamboo and reeds, which can help control erosion.

Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda Flooding from River Nyamwamba cut off one of the main roads in the Kasese area, affecting thousands of residents. Local officials are still assessing damage in the region and deciding how to proceed with reconstruction.

But Centenary Robert Franco, a member of Parliament who represents the Kasese municipality, says the responsibility for managing the land lies elsewhere.

“It’s not my duty to protect the environment – there are organizations for that,” he says. “We do not make these people stay on the land.”

Local residents say they are aware of efforts to restore the riverbanks, but the plans don’t put food on their tables, leaving them with no choice but to continue to build and farm along the river. “I cannot grow bamboo on the small land I have,” says Bera Edith, 36, a mother of five whose house was destroyed in mudslides last May.

Since the flooding, Bera, Bambu and approximately 900 other residents of the region have been living in tents and semipermanent houses in the Kibota Seventh Day Adventist Camp for internally displaced people.

Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda The Kibota Seventh Day Adventist Camp houses approximately 900 people from the Kasese region. Conditions in the camp have been deteriorating, and residents have appealed to the government to provide better accommodations and sanitation.

Conditions in the camp are deteriorating, according to Sikabyahoro Jimmy, the camp’s chairman.

“Many have symptoms of typhoid and malaria, and there are no drugs in the nearest health center,” he says. He adds that aid workers at the camp have been overwhelmed and that the last delivery of supplies was in October.

“There is no food, the hospital is far,” he says. “We have called for help, but no one is coming.”

Centenary says the government is aware of conditions in the camp and is trying to get the displaced residents food and other necessities, and permanently resettle them in areas less prone to flooding. But finding available land to house them has proven challenging, and many Kasese residents say they would like to return to their original homes, despite the risk of flooding.

Kabbyanga, Kasese’s mayor, says local officials are still working to assess the damage to the area. For Bambu and other Kasese residents, however, rebuilding has become a way of life.

“The mountains do get angry, but sometimes you get a rainbow after the storm,” she says. “I just hope to never experience the rage of the rivers again. I pray that for my children as well.”","Tue, 26 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://globalpressjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GPJNews_Uganda_PL_Hospitalbridge_-34_web2048-650x434c.jpg,"['devastation', 'camp', 'rivers', 'coming', 'land', 'help', 'region', 'residents', 'kasese', 'floods', 'uganda', 'flooding', 'hospital', 'face']", 
8,8,FL-2019-000163-UGA,Uganda 'When It Rains … We Cry': River Submerges Livelihoods - Global Press Journal,https://globalpressjournal.com/africa/uganda/rains-cry-overflowing-river-submerges-livelihoods/,"ELEGU, UGANDA — It didn’t rain the day 2-year-old Raymond Giga was found submerged in water next to the bed he shared with his mother.

But the River Unyama still poured in from the east and swallowed him, says Raymond’s mother, Sylvia Gimono, her eyes wet with tears. Raymond was two weeks shy of celebrating his third birthday when he tumbled off the bed into water pooling on the floor. His mother, in a nearby room, didn’t hear a sound.

An hour after his sister found him, Raymond was pronounced dead.

Gimono, who runs a small motel in this burgeoning community on the border of Uganda and South Sudan, blames the flood for taking her child’s life and decimating her business. She moved to the northern town of Elegu to make a living off increased trade as both countries, after years of internal conflict, settled into periods of peace. But she encountered a new kind of threat.

The November flood, which left thousands homeless and ruined numerous operations like Gimono’s, wasn’t the first. Destructive floods have overwhelmed the area multiple times in recent years as increasingly heavy rains meet with the side effects of a swelling population, including uprooted trees along the river’s banks and the destruction of wetlands through farming. While some officials point to the ramifications of growth, residents accuse the government of failing to implement a long-promised flood mitigation plan that may have spared businesses and saved the lives of children like Raymond.

Nakisanze Segawa, GPJ Uganda Ugandans who live near the border with South Sudan chopped trees along the riverbank to make room for an increasing population. This has made it more difficult to prevent flooding.

Government officials “are not feeling the pitch of the suffering of the people,” says Michael Lakony, a chairperson of the district where Elegu is located, about 163 kilometers (101 miles) from the nearest big city, Gulu. “This is a known disaster and should be easy to deal with.”

The town sits in a low-lying area especially susceptible to floods. “When it rains in Gulu,” he says, “in Elegu we cry.”

Uganda is experiencing more frequent and fierce droughts and floods, according to a 2018 climate change profile by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Rainfall is expected to increase, particularly here in the country’s north, escalating the risk of natural disasters.

Floods killed seven people last year, displaced more than 4,000 community members, and ruined billions of Ugandan shillings’ worth of goods, including cement and maize, Lakony says. Gulu received more than 90 centimeters (35 inches) of rainfall from September to November, about double the usual average, according to data from the national weather agency.

Nakisanze Segawa, GPJ Uganda Elegu sits in a low-lying area susceptible to flooding. Residents say the government hasn’t done enough to address the increased risk.

The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives could have solved the flooding problem in 2018, Lakony says, when it signed a memorandum of understanding with TradeMark East Africa, a Nairobi-based nonprofit focused on trade, to implement a flood mitigation plan worth 1.8 billion shillings (about $490,000). The plan called for constructing a drainage system to contain the floods and creating channels 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from Elegu to divert the water.

The area, by that point, had grown from a scattering of grass-thatched homes to a substantial community with a tarmacked road, the groan of breaking trucks and the constant buzz of moving commerce.

The growth started in 2008, soon after the end of Uganda’s two-decade civil war, which displaced nearly 2 million residents and, according to some estimates, killed more than 100,000 people. Three years later, South Sudan gained independence from Sudan and officially became a country. And the village of Elegu became a town.

Elegu’s population has grown about 30 times since 2012, when it had 4,000 residents, Lakony says. But nothing has come of the flood plan.

Government officials disagree. Amelia Kyambadde, the minister for Trade, Industry and Cooperatives, says an initial evaluation showed the area was too swampy to implement the mitigation plan. Government engineers are aware of the situation, she says, and are working with TradeMark East Africa on an alternative solution. She declined to discuss the timeframe.

TradeMark East Africa didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Nakisanze Segawa, GPJ Uganda Elegu’s main road lacks a drainage system that would help ward against devastating floods.

Wilfred Baguma, a local councilman, says water overflow has been an issue since the 1970s. But increased rain and farming near the snaking Unyama riverbank have worsened the problem.

Low-lying areas like Elegu tend to flood because residents have chopped down the trees near and along the river that could have contained overflow, says Joshua Zaake, executive director of Environmental Alert, a nongovernmental organization based in Kampala.

Many who have benefitted from growth are now the ones suffering. Sarah Nakizza, a household goods trader at Elegu market, has lost products to the floods. When the water flows through the market at night, she says, most of her stored goods get swept away.

Ugandans in the region initially made money exporting food, water, soap, eggs and construction materials to the newly independent South Sudan. But Elegu quickly grew into a way station for people who desired goods from either side — cooking oil, sugar and tinned milk are cheaper in South Sudan, for example — and for traders in need of accommodation.

Trucks lining the main road have Kenyan, Tanzanian and Ugandan license plates. Vendors sell sliced pineapples along a street crammed with lodges and a boisterous market.

Some now fear the repercussions of that development. Residents like Gimono demand a clearer strategy to deal with the lack of drainage channels and other mitigation techniques. If for nothing else, she says, than for her son.

Otherwise, “next time it will be another woman’s child killed by floods.”

11,11,FL-2019-000163-UGA,Uganda wants people to leave flooded wetlands - and not come back - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-environment-housing-trfn-idUSKBN23I15P,"ENTEBBE, Uganda (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - For the last decade, Silus Musasizi has lived on a wetland on the shores of Lake Victoria. For most of that time, Uganda’s government has been trying to chase him away.

Now, it is the water itself that has driven him from his small house on the edge of Entebbe, a Ugandan town that juts into Africa’s largest lake.

Thousands have been displaced from their homes along the shoreline by the worst flooding since records began more than a century ago. Musasizi, who works as a truck driver, is renting a room on higher ground until the waters recede.

“Homes have been destroyed,” said Musasizi, whose family came here originally seeking cheap land. “My friends are now on the streets.”

The Ugandan government has said people like Musasizi are partly to blame for the floods, and wants them to leave the wetlands for good.

It plans to start evicting people without compensation this month - in the middle of a coronavirus lockdown that has hit the poor hardest.

‘RICH WILL REMAIN’

Alfred Okot Okidi, the top civil servant at the ministry of water and environment, said 700,000 Ugandans had been affected by flooding nationwide, almost all of whom live illegally in the protected zones around lakes and rivers.

Settlement, cultivation and industry were destroying the wetlands, which act as “natural sponges” to absorb excess rainfall, Okidi told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The evictions are in line with a directive issued by President Yoweri Museveni, who warned in an address last week that the floods “should be an eternal lesson to all of us”.

That is a message heard with scepticism in the swamps of Entebbe, where houses crumble into the water and men fish in flooded gardens.

Peter Kisakye Zzimula, the pastor of a church on the wetlands, argued that people only build there because they cannot afford to rent property elsewhere.

“Nobody would wish to be here but people are oppressed,” he said. “If you evict them, where will they go?”

The rains over east Africa have been unusually heavy since last year and climate scientists have predicted more such weather in future.

But the flooding is exacerbated by local factors including the destruction of forests and wetlands, said Frank Muramuzi, executive director of the National Association of Professional Environmentalists, a civil society group.

Muramuzi said wealthy investors were snapping up land to grow rice or flowers for sale, and set up hotels and resorts.

“All those establishments are being done by rich people and some them have connections in government,” he said.

“The poor people will be evicted, but the rich people will remain.”

‘GOD HAS COME’

Last year, wetlands covered just 8.4% of Uganda, down from 15.5% in 1994, according to the environment ministry.

In 2014 the government ordered the cancellation of all land titles there, issued illegally by local officials because the law prohibits private ownership of wetlands.

A subsequent survey of four central districts identified 1,700 titles in wetlands, said Collins Oloya, the acting director of environmental affairs at the environment ministry.

But the process has become bogged down in lengthy court proceedings and only 300 titles have so far been cancelled.

Now the rising waters are forcing people out of the wetlands, doing Oloya’s work for him.

“I’m very happy that God has come,” he said.

But the political pressures that have stymied past threats of eviction may do so again, with elections scheduled for next year.

Police fired teargas at protesting vendors last month as they shut down a flooded market on another stretch of shoreline.

“We need to conserve the environment, but at the same time we need to be conscious that we are dealing with human beings,” said Kayanja Vincent de Paul, the mayor of Entebbe.

“It is a hotcake. If you handle it badly, it can burn you up.”

SUSPICION

Tensions are heightened by popular suspicion. Musasizi, the truck driver, believes governments have engineered the floods to grab land from the poor.

“After this water has chased these poor people, more hotels are going to be built here,” he said.

Meanwhile Judith Amojong, another resident, is hoping for divine intervention.

She used to sleep in the local church with a few other homeless worshippers.

One day she foresaw a great flood. “I got a dream where the world was full of water,” she recalled.

Soon after, the waters started seeping under the corrugated iron walls, bringing coldness and snakes.

Amojong, who is now sheltering at the house of a fellow churchgoer, hopes that she will not have to return.

“We are praying God gives us money in order to leave this place because we cannot fight nature, this is fighting God.”","Thu, 11 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['leave', 'come', 'titles', 'wetlands', 'land', 'musasizi', 'god', 'local', 'flooded', 'uganda', 'water', 'poor', 'environment', 'waters', 'wants']",

Heavy rainfalls experienced in the Eastern parts of Uganda in the months of May and June 2019 caused flooding and landside disasters within the Elgon region, directly affecting 569 households (2,845 individuals) in four districts of Bududa, Sironko, Mbale and Butaleja. The landslides in Bududa district caused six (6) deaths, and injuries to 27 persons who were all treated and recovered. Pease refer to the EPoA for details on impact per affected district.

As anticipated, an outbreak of cholera was later confirmed by the Ministry of Health in Bududa district two weeks after the launch of this DREF operation, which affected the same community affected by the landslides. A total of 72 cholera cases, with 3 deaths were recorded (Case Fatality Rate=4.17%). The operation therefore refocussed its strategy towards provision of safe water, improved sanitation, and hygiene behaviours among the affected and other at-risk communities in Bududa, Sironko, Butaleja and Mbale districts. The Ministry of Health later launched Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaign in Bududa where the operation supported with community mobilization that increased uptake of the vaccine among all at-risk individuals. All these efforts led to rapid interruption of the cholera outbreak spread in Bududa that prevented it from affecting other at-risk areas in neighbouring Manafwa, Namisindwa, Butaleja, Sironko, Mbale and Bulambuli districts.

On 20 June 2019, IFRC launched a DREF operation worth CHF 151,041 to support Uganda Red Cross Society respond to humanitarian needs of 2,845 people affected by landslides and floods disasters in Bududa, Mbale, Butaleja, and Sironko district. The emergency operation successfully ran from June to September 2019, although the heavy rainfall situation was still widespread, which caused fresh flooding events in completely new areas around November 2019, just two months after closure of this operation.","Wed, 24 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1557103-MDRUG042dfr.png?itok=UygFxY8C,"['cholera', 'mdrug042', 'landslides', 'final', 'mbale', 'butaleja', 'sironko', 'operation', 'report', 'dref', 'district', '2019', 'affected', 'floods', 'uganda', 'n', 'bududa']",

The Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA) has warned that some parts of the country are likely to experience strong winds and hailstorms as the rainy season sets in.

The authority has asked Ugandans to take precaution because there will be cases of thunderstorm, lightning and hailstorms.

The alert issued by the authority in a tweet on Monday said: “Alert! The rains expected in most parts of the country are likely to be associated with medium to strong winds. Be sure to reinforce your roofs for living houses, granary stores, and others; if there is need. Keep safe.”

Dr Festus Luboyera, the UNMA executive director, said there is a high likelihood of having rains above normal levels in several parts of the country.

“The onset of seasonal rains is anticipated to be characterised by severe isolated lightning, thunder and hailstorms,” he warned.

He said the predicted rains forecast should be used for planning in all rain-fed economic activities so as to improve economic welfare and livelihoods for all communities in their localities.

“UNMA will continue to monitor the evolution of relevant weather systems, particularly the state of the Seas Surface Temperature and Indian Ocean Dipole, and issue appropriate rainfall alerts, updates and advisories to the users regularly, especially to those areas that have been heavily affected by floods and landslides disasters,” he added.

Dr Luboyera said the major physical conditions that are likely to influence the increased rainfall for the next three months in Uganda include the current and evolving Sea Surface Temperature anomalies over global oceans.

He specifically pointed out the increased probability for Neutral El Nino Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole through the months of March, April and May period.

Dr Luboyera said the expected rains in most parts of the country may, however, present good prospects for improved agricultural production.

“Farmers and other agricultural practitioners are highly encouraged to take advantage of the expected good rains to optimise food and crop production,” he said.

He also advised farmers to plant trees, restock livestock farms, fish ponds and apiaries.

Dr Luboyera warned that there will be floods in central Uganda and landslides in mountainous areas of Kigezi, Rwenzori and the Elgon regions. He also warned that there could be an invasion of locusts.

“The disaster risk management institutions should review their contingency plans,” he said.

He said areas expected to receive average to above average rainfall should undertake integrated flood management, flood preparedness and mitigation strategies in flood-prone areas and plans for optimisation of power generation and distribution should be enhanced due to the expected increased discharge of seasonal rain water into the water bodies.

He said the urban areas should prepare for the flash floods by clearing water and drainage channels.

“Urban authorities need to clear and reduce blockages of the drainage systems to avoid water logging on streets. Strong winds may be experienced, which can cause structural damages to buildings,” he said.

Impact on health

Dr Festus Luboyera, the UNMA executive director, said there is high risk of malaria in wetter areas of Teso, Lake Victoria basin, Lake Kyoga basin, lowlands adjacent to Elgon region, and risk of cholera is expected in Buliisa, Busia, South western, Bulambuli, Karamoja sub-region and Namayingo District.

“There is, therefore, need to conduct community awareness about the potential outbreak of the diseases in context and surveillance,” he said.

Then came the alarms raised by those living in the hilltop areas, those who could run, racing down to warn people along the valley and lowlands to run. A torrent of water was on its way down the mountain. Four rivers in Kasese district – the Nyamwamba, Mubuku, Nyamughasana and Lhubiriha – had burst their banks.

“I realised a disaster was coming. It was a matter of life and death,” Masika, 34, tells the Guardian. “I ran back to the house to wake up my husband and children. I knocked and alerted our neighbours. The floods and stones are coming to kill us,” she says.

That night heavy rains in the area of western Uganda swept away homes, schools, submerged farms, cut off bridges and left several roads inaccessible, affecting 24,760 houses and an estimated 173,000 people, according to a disaster committee interim assessment report.

“We couldn’t sleep on the hill. It was so cold. The children were crying. There was nothing I could do,” says Masika as she lights a fire to cook at a makeshift home in Kilembe, about 10km north-west of Kasese town.

“We came back in the afternoon after the water had receded and saw the great devastation of the floods. The water destroyed and swept away everything,” she says. “We have been left homeless and very desperate. Where do we start from? We need urgent assistance.”

A few kilometres down the road of this tourist region, Philly Donald Baluku, a travel guide, said the impact was a disaster. “I have been working as a tour guide on a contract basis. The tourism sector closed because of Covid-19 restrictions. The floods have rendered me homeless now,” says Baluku.

“What do I do? I have nine dependents. My brother has offered us a single room to stay. But we don’t have bedding and food. We are living in a very hopeless and desperate situation.

“All my property, banana plantations, vanilla and crops which I was supposed to harvest in September were swept away.”

The floodwater destroyed the Nyamwamba hydroelectric power station, and overran the wards, mortuary and drug stores of Kilembe Mines hospital.

The villages of Kyanjuki, Bulembia and Katiri are now buried under mud and huge stones that were propelled down the mountain. Homes on lower land are submerged in water.

“I haven’t seen anything like this. I’m seeing for the first time where everything has been run down,” says Stephen Oluka, the director of Uganda’s National Emergency Coordination and Operations Centre, on a visit to Kasese town.

“The infrastructure has been damaged. The hospital and power station has been overrun. People’s houses along the path have all been swept away. Gardens, crops and cows have been taken away,” he says.

Buildings damaged by the flooding at Kilembe

Schools and churches have been designated temporary displacement camps.

“The living conditions are bad and alarming. The basic facilities are lacking,” says Catherine Kugoza, 37, a mother of six, sheltering in Karusandara church, about 20km south of Kasese.

“We are starving. People are taking dirty water from the stream. The one latrine is full. People are defecating in the open. This is a recipe for disease outbreaks like cholera and dysentery.”

When the Guardian visited Karusandara on Saturday, the camp was hosting more than 1,000 people, mostly women and children, with just 18 tents supplied by Save the Children.

“It’s a crisis situation. We have children in the camps. They don’t have blankets, they need mosquito nets, people don’t have food,” says Robert Centenary, a lawmaker for Kasese municipality. “People don’t have supplies for purifying water; they don’t have utensils to use in the camps. The situation has caused an appalling sanitation crisis. We may end up degenerating into a cholera outbreak.

“We really need a lot of water and sanitation support. We want the government to immediately come to the rescue of the people.”

The Uganda Red Cross Society says the immediate needs include shelter, food, bedding, mosquito nets, utensils, mobile toilets, water storage facilities and tarpaulins. It is appealing for more resources.

Oluka says overcrowding in makeshift centres had complicated efforts to combat Covid-19. “The guidelines have been compromised. I didn’t see anyone [displaced] in the camps with a mask. The leaders are telling people to maintain social distancing but it’s not attainable. There is overcrowding in camps.”

He adds: “I don’t think they are now bothered about coronavirus, which they haven’t seen. They are bothered about what has affected them now [floodings], safety from waters and their livelihoods.”

In its outlook for March to May, Uganda’s National Meteorological Authority warned of heavy rainfall over several parts of the country, which could lead to flooding and landslides, causing loss of lives, destruction of property and infrastructure.

Floods and landslides have killed 194 people in neighbouring Kenya and 65 in north-west Rwanda in the past week. On Sunday morning, there was another wave of flash floods in Uganda.

“We have looked at the magnitude of the problem. It is too huge. It requires immediate, medium and long-term interventions,” says Oluka.

By Justus Wanzala

BUDALANGI, Kenya, Aug 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Women dashed around open kitchens dotted across the playground of Bubango Primary School, preparing to feed the hundreds of children who now call the school in western Kenya their home.

About 400 families from Budalangi, in Busia County, have been living at the school since April, when the Nzoia River that flows from Kenya's western highlands into Lake Victoria burst its banks in the worst flooding the area has seen in decades.

After more than a year of unusually heavy rainfall, over 800,000 Kenyans have been displaced by flooding, according to the government.

The situation has been made worse by flooded rivers channelling huge volumes of water into Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake, causing it to spill over onto its shores - a phenomenon called ""backflow"".

""We lost everything when our homes got inundated with water. Houses have been destroyed, livestock and crops swept away,"" said Hesborne Opondo, 45, who lost his shop to the rising lake.

His wife now sells flatbread to others living at Bubango school to support their six children, he added.

Scientists warn that other massive flood events may be ahead as climate change strengthens, and some have urged the three countries that share the lake - Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania - to work together to put systems in place to lessen flood damage.

""There should be a joint effort in dealing with disaster management and preparedness in the lake region,"" said Alfred Owuor Opere, a climate and water expert at the University of Nairobi.

Management of the dams that regulate the flow of water into Lake Victoria should especially be a regional concern, as the area is expected to receive enhanced rainfall in future, he added.

While Budalangi is no stranger to flooding, in recent years the damage has been limited by two dykes the government built 20 years ago along the Nzoia River and on the southern shore of Lake Victoria, according to local elders.

But this year, the dykes could not contain the flooding - the most severe the area has seen since the 1960s, say experts, who attribute it to a combination of climate change and the erosion of shores by urbanisation and farming.

A year of extraordinarily heavy rains, which started in April 2019 following a drought, pushed the lake's water level up to 13.4 metres (44 feet) in May, breaking the previous 1964 record, according to the Lake Victoria Basin Commission.

In normal years, the lake has an average level of 12 metres.

While the waters that burst from the Nzoia have started to recede, the backflow from the lake is still flooding surrounding areas, residents said.

With climate change likely a major contributor to the recent flooding, the nations around Lake Victoria must work together to tackle the problem, said Joseph Awange, a professor of earth sciences at Curtin University in the Australian city of Perth.

""Engineering measures such as damming and planting trees to regulate the use of water could be considered,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email interview.

Uganda, where Lake Victoria feeds into the Nile River, is seen as a key player in preventing flooding in the region, he noted.

Since its construction in 1954, Uganda's Nalubaale dam has controlled the flow of water out of Lake Victoria into the Nile, in line with a treaty between Uganda and Egypt, he explained.

If the water in the dam rises above a certain level, Uganda must release some to maintain the natural flow of the Nile.

Leaders in western Kenya have accused Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni of not doing enough to control backflow.

In June, Raphael Wanjala, a member of parliament for Budalangi, called on the East African Legislative Assembly to intervene and urged Museveni to complete the ongoing construction of another dam along the Nile.

But Sam Cheptoris, Uganda's environment minister, told media in May that the rapid rise of Lake Victoria was due to a mix of environmental degradation, poor land use practices and urbanisation that has stopped the ground absorbing rainfall.

These factors resulted in the ""speedy movement of water into the lakes and rivers"" feeding into Lake Victoria, he said.

SILTED RIVERS

George William Omony, a senior meteorologist at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority, said that above-average rainfall plays a major role in causing backflow but the phenomenon has been amplified by human activities.

He pointed to the growing number of villages and farms on Lake Victoria's shores, which are protected areas where human settlement and farming is prohibited.

When forests along the rivers that feed into the lake are cleared for farming, they lose trees whose roots hold onto soil and minimise the amount of mud and silt that end up in rivers.

When rivers become silted, they can hold less water before overflowing or pushing it back into the lake, he explained.

He and other climate experts said the recent extreme flooding is linked to a cyclical process of drought and heavy rainfall that happens in the Lake Victoria area every 50 years or so.

""While it is difficult to tell when the cycle will repeat, the chances of it happening again are high,"" Omony added.

BENEFITING COMMUNITIES

Opere, at the University of Nairobi, said Lake Victoria communities and the government could also work together to reduce the risk of backflow and flooding.

He suggested planting trees along rivers and building channels to carry floodwater away from the lake and into water pans and reservoirs to use for livestock and irrigation.

He also stressed the importance of dams in regulating the amount of water flowing into Lake Victoria.

Plans by Kenya's government to build major dams to curb flooding along the Nyando, Nzoia and Yala rivers - the first of which is due to start construction on the Nyando in September - will help protect and support local communities, he added.

Government officials have said residents will be allowed to fish in the water behind the dams and use it for domestic and agricultural purposes.

""The dams will have a huge impact in reducing this flooding menace around the lake while providing economic opportunities for people living in these areas,"" Opere said.

20,20,FL-2019-000163-UGA,"Ugandan hospital, Somali town washed away by East Africa floods - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-africa-floods/ugandan-hospital-somali-town-washed-away-by-east-africa-floods-idUSKBN22K1UC,"NAIROBI/KAMPALA (Reuters) - Flooding washed away roads, bridges and a hospital in Uganda and an entire small town in Somalia as torrential rain across East Africa compounded problems for governments struggling to respond to the new coronavirus.

Hundreds of people have been killed by floodwaters in Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Rwanda and Ethiopia which have also displaced hundreds of thousands across the region.

Heavy overnight rains flooded areas around Mountain Rwenzori in Western Uganda after the River Nyamwamba burst its banks, forcing people to seek refuge in nearby schools and destroying roads and bridges, a senior government official said.

“What complicates the matter is that this is the era of COVID. People are expected to maintain social distance but how do you maintain distance in such a situation?” Julius Mucunguzi, spokesman for the prime minister’s office, said by telephone.

One of the hospitals in the area, Kilembe, was also overrun by the gushing waters despite being built on a raised bank and reinforced with sandbags.

“There are wards which were completely washed away. The mortuary was swept away. You wouldn’t know that once upon a time there was a mortuary there. The drugs and drug stores were washed away,” Mucunguzi said.

In Ethiopia, the Somali region in the east of the country has borne the brunt of the floods, which have displaced more than 100,000 people, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

In neighbouring Somalia, an unspecified number of people were killed when floods washed away an entire small town in the semi-autonomous Puntland region, officials said.

The heavy rains stem from moisture dumped in the region by winds coming in from the Indian Ocean where temperatures have risen in recent months, Chris Shisanya, a professor of climatology at Nairobi-based Kenyatta University, said.

“This is a carry-over of what we had last year,” he said, referring to floods and landslides in the region.

Nearly 200 people in Kenya have been killed by the floods, which have also displaced 100,000 more.

“This is compounding the COVID-19 response,” Kenya Health Ministry Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman told a news conference.

“The displaced people have been forced to congregate in makeshift camps with the risk of banding together exposing them to the possibility of contracting the virus.”

Official recorded deaths from COVID-19 are at least 102 across East Africa, where the virus arrived later than many other parts of the world.","Fri, 08 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['africa', 'killed', 'somali', 'somalia', 'kenya', 'town', 'east', 'ugandan', 'region', 'away', 'displaced', 'floods', 'uganda', 'hospital', 'washed']",

“As members of from sugar growing areas, we would like to register our dismay at the casual nature in which the trade ministry has continued to handle an issue that has potential of destroying the livelihoods of eight million Kenyans who depend on the industry,” Koyoo said.

“While the Agriculture Committee investigating the circumstances under which 10 companies belonging to two individuals imported 47,000 metric tons without the prerequisite pre-shipment inspection from the Sugar Directorate, the same Trade ministry which has been mentioned as having overstepped mandate has gone ahead to sign a communiqué’, a clear affront to Parliament and its institutions.”

Okelo said they will not allow a grain of the imported sugar to enter into the country and flood the market linking the importation deal to the coming 2022 elections campaign funding.

“Towards elections, things like sugar importation and hike in fuel prices become common since sugar barons and cartels are trying to raise money for campaigns,” Okelo said.

Odege said Uganda has no advantage over Kenya in terms of sugar production faulting the government for doing little to revive the country’s sugar sector.

“This will open floodgates for other people to import sugar from other countries through Uganda and the net effect is that all our factories will die,” Naicca said.

Ndhiwa MP Martins Owino, a member of the Agriculture Committee, said leaving out the Agriculture ministry from the Uganda delegation was mischievous.

At least 16 bodies have been recovered after torrential rain caused landslides in western Uganda, the Red Cross has said.

“Our team continues to recover more bodies including some that are trapped by cocoa trees in Bundibugyo hills. It is a very devastating moment,” the humanitarian agency said in a tweet on Sunday.

An aid team has been deployed to search and recover bodies in Bundibugyo district, which was affected by the landslides after days of heavy rainfall.

“We have provided body bags and blankets to manage the dead in a dignified manner before handing them over to families and hospitals,” Irene Nakasita, Red Cross spokeswoman, said.

The East African nation is undergoing its second rainy season, which has reached its peak in most parts of the country. The Uganda National Meteorological Authority has predicted heavy rainfall will continue throughout December.

The heavy rains have caused destructive flooding in several low-lying parts of the country and landslides in the mountainous regions. Destructive wind and hailstorms have ravaged plantations and crops across Uganda.

More than 20 people have been killed as a result of floods and mudslides in the last week in Uganda. The eastern parts of the country have also been suffering floods and landslides around the Mount Elgon region.

In a statement on Friday, Musa Ecweru, Uganda’s minister of state for disaster preparedness, said: “Four people were killed in Bududa district and another four including two children in Sironko district.”

“Over 10,000 people have been displaced in eastern Uganda alone and we are currently reviewing villages’ household registers to establish the number and names of missing persons,” Ecweru said.

The government has now released more than $5.4m for emergency procurement.

These include inflatable boats, tarpaulins, blankets, relief food, drugs for water-borne diseases and culverts for fixing washed away bridges.

The extreme weather has been blamed on the Indian Ocean Dipole – a climate system defined by the difference in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the ocean.

At the moment, the ocean around East Africa is far warmer than usual, resulting in higher evaporation and moist air flowing inwards over the continent as rain: the hallmarks of a “positive” dipole.

Scientists warn that as ocean temperatures rise because of climate change, Indian Ocean dipoles will become more frequent and severe.","Sun, 08 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/a9da3b70ff634047847981db622f315d_18.jpeg?fit=998%2C562,"['team', 'red', 'dozen', 'landslides', 'cross', 'kills', 'parts', 'bodies', 'country', 'uganda', 'western', 'flooding', 'bundibugyo', 'ocean']",

Description of the disaster

On 12 December 2019, Uganda Red Cross Society (URCS) with support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), launched a DREF operation in response to landslide events which occurred following prolonged rainfall from 29 November and 3 December 2019 the districts of Mbale and Bududa in Eastern Region of Uganda. These landslides affected 380 households (1,900 people). These landslides occurred in the broader context of extensive flooding across the whole of Uganda, which started in October and continued throughout December 2019.

During the assessments, URCS working with government (district and National teams such as the DDMCs) rescued and provided temporary shelters as well as psychosocial support to the affected and most vulnerable persons using resources at hand. Indeed, within the same period, Uganda had experienced another major flood and landslide in the Western region of Bundibugyo with 4,436HH 30,919 individuals (14,873Males and 16,046 Females) affected with 2,450 of those displaced and living in the two camps of Simuliki and Bubukwanga camps. As such, the NS extended the scope of the response to provide WASH assistance to the families affected in this district, which allowed URCS to reach 37,603 people (approx. 7,520 HH) through this DREF operation.","Mon, 01 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1557671-Uganda%20-%20Landslides%20Final%20Report%20-%20DREF%20Operation%20MDRUG043.png?itok=KKz80Nxs,"['mdrug043', 'landslides', 'urcs', 'red', 'final', 'operation', 'report', 'support', 'dref', 'response', 'region', 'occurred', 'affected', 'uganda']",

A week of heavy rains caused floods and mudslides in Eastern Uganda’s Bugisu and Bundibugyo regions near Rwenzori Mountain.



Authorities say the flooding has taken a toll with the loss of life and property, and with thousands more left stranded.



The Ugandan Red Cross’s Irene Nakasita says search and rescue operations in the regions are hampered as most roads have been washed away.



“And the decision has been taken to put up a transit shelter until the situation normalizes. So, most likely Bubukwang transit center is going to house close to 700 people who are displaced in Bundibugyo,” she said.



Meanwhile, Uganda’s State Minister for Disaster Preparedness and Relief Musa Ecweru says there are concerns about water-borne disease outbreaks in flood-affected areas.



“Now, there’s a risk of contamination of water and if that is not handled well, then we are going to risk another phase of a challenge, an outbreak of cholera which will compound our humanitarian intervention,” he said.



Ecweru says the government has released $5.4 million for emergency drugs to treat water-borne diseases, inflatable boats, tarps, blankets, food, and repairing bridges.



Ugandan authorities say the flooding is expected to recede in January as the weather improves.



Scientists have long warned that rising ocean temperatures are making seasonal rains more severe and more frequent.



The United Nation’s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) last week (Dec 4) said unusually heavy rainfall and flooding in East Africa has affected over 2.8 million people and left at least 280 dead.

UNOCHA said the unusually heavy rainfall was driven by the differences in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the Indian Ocean.

The UN office said rains were expected to diminish in the weeks ahead but heavy rains would likely persist into December and intensify in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

As the world battles a pandemic, large swaths of the African continent have been —literally — submerged by floods.

Since March, this crisis has left more than 400 people dead in East Africa. A separate round of flooding has hit West Africa’s Sahel region.

In Uganda, Catholic Relief services estimates that as many as 580,000 people are affected.

Country director Niek de Goeij says ""It's kind of affecting all kinds of people. You know, in Kampala, our capital city, it affects people who have nice houses on the lakeshore. But if you are in the Mount Elgon area, on the border with Kenya; or you're in the Kasese area, on the border with the D.R. Congo, and you’re a smallholder farmer normally benefits from farming on a river bank. And suddenly there’s this raging flash floods that comes down to hills and mountains because of this very intense rainfall — you know, you lose everything. You lose your house, you lose your land. And so it's a very diverse group of people that is affected.”

In the eastern town of Jinja, along the shores of Lake Victoria, radio host and environmental activist John Hillary says flooding doesn’t just destroy homes it ruins the very fabric that holds society together.

“The public hospital, the only public hospital in the Chilembwe region, was completely destroyed. So people as a result of the floods got sick. But they could not get anywhere else to go to because the hospital had been destroyed,” he said.

De Goeij says heavy rainfall is normal in East Africa — what isn’t, he says, is their frequency and intensity. And, he says, the pandemic makes it harder for groups like his to respond.

“It's like a triple crisis in Uganda, right? We have the locusts, we have all the floods. And then, on top of everything else, we have COVID-19. And so it's been, for the affected people, it’s been an especially hard year, you know, to be on a lockdown and be affected by floods, and then because of the lockdown, accessing the support and the relief that that they're entitled to,” he said.

Hillary, who speaks often about climate change on his radio show, says that to him and other activists, this is personal.

“My mom is a gardener. My grandparents, and many people in my family, are farmers. That's what I've known,"" he said. ""Growing up, I always went with my mom to the garden to dig, and we ate food from the gardens.

I'm only 26. I have seen over time my world deteriorating. I don't want to see the same for my children.”

This, he says, is a living nightmare. This is his home, and he wants future generations to see its beauty, too.","Tue, 13 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/kaltura-video-thumbs/1_z/1_zr629y9g.jpg,"['africa', 'large', 'lose', 'rainfall', 'youre', 'relief', 'east', 'widespread', 'know', 'destroyed', 'devastate', 'floods', 'uganda', 'world', 'hospital', 'sections']",

Recognizing that many parts of Uganda including Lake Victoria received above normal rainfall between mid- April to late June, 2020, water levels have risen further resulting in floods with severe effects around the country.

At Ggaba landing site located North of Lake Victoria and Port Bell, a small industrial Centre in the South of the Lake, life and settlement has been disrupted by the flooding water that has submerged the areas.

Places such as Ggaba and Port Bell markets have all been submerged by water and traders have resorted to selling food and other items on the road that leads to the markets. Similarly, happening places such as Ggaba Beach, K.K Beach, Miami Beach have been swallowed by water. Others that have been affected are Ggaba Water Works offices, Serena- Kigo Hotel, Speke Resort Hotel- Munyonyo, and several others surrounding the great water body.

The question on most people’s minds when they see a flooded market, homes and businesses on the shores of Lake Victoria is whether the beaches, landing sites, and some islands they have known all their life will resurface.

Standing at the flooded part of Ggaba landing site is Kassim Katende, the chairperson of the fishermen at Ggaba.

“Most of the community members here depend on fishing, but right now we do not have fish because the lake is full of water and security forces are guarding the waters,” lamented Katende.

Sarah Kaine, a businesswoman who sells food items at Gaba, expresses her fears for the dying business because of the flooding of the area.

""Our customers have disappeared and we are worried that we may not be able to continue with our business again. My selling point has been flooded and I have no other option but to wait until it dries up,” narrates Kaine in agony.

Mzee Sulaiman Kassujja a trader dealing in fish selling at the same landing site for the past 25 years narrates that, “we who sell fish are affected so much because fishermen no longer catch good fish and in large quantities. The few fish caught are very expensive.”

According to Sulaiman, the rise in the price of the fish has made their customers to opt for other substitutes such as meat and chicken. He further noted that the rise is also as a result of the challenge in accessing the catch from the lake and increase in costs as a result of lockdown.

Currently, a big tilapia goes for UGX 35,000 ($9.21), up from UGX 20,000 ($5.26), an initial price before the disaster outbreak.

Hamis Gamwero, the LC1 for Ggaba landing site and has lived in Ggaba for four decades said, “Since I came here in 1986, I have never seen this kind of flood. The people, especially traders are at a high risk of contracting other diseases, and it is worse that we have coronavirus.”

Kamadha Kakooza, the Katoogo Village, chairperson, told us that at least 500 families have already left the place and hundreds, which have been rendered homeless, have been accommodated in other peoples’ homes that are yet to be invaded by the overflowing water.

“When the water levels started rising, those who could, chose to vacate the area. Some [who had nowhere to go] remained. What we did was to talk to those who are yet to be affected to at least accommodate those affected for some time,” he said.

Meanwhile, at Port Bell in Luzira, which is also a rail link and a railroad ferry wharf used for International traffic across Lake Victoria to Tanzania and Kenya, the story is not different. The water has entered into houses of the dwellers and forced them to seek refuge somewhere else.

“People are trying to desilt the water by pouring sand but the environment authorities are against it,” said Teopista Nankinga, a women’s leader at Port Bell.

Markets and settlements near the Lake have severely been affected and homes submerged by the flooding water. The disaster has also been recorded at the same time when the country is under lockdown in March because of COVID-19. This means that the affected people are left with a few options for survival since most of them could not travel to their villages.

Many of these businesses and government installations were located outside the 200 perimeter buffer zone recommended by the government. Their destruction raises tough questions about the level of government planning. If the 200 meter perimeter buffer zone recommended by the government is not safe, what is safe? Suppose businesses move farther away from the expanded lake shore, what happens when the lake shore eventually recedes?

The continued downpour and flooding has had negative impacts on the people and property downstream of Lake Victoria during the time when the country and region at large is on a lockdown, as a means of controlling the potential spread of coronavirus.

Environment experts warn that the flooding of the lake tributaries has been accelerated by environmental degradation, which has caused a disruption of the water bodies.

Dr. Daniel Babikwa, the District Support Coordinator at the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), said that the communities encroached on the shores of the Lake, thus disturbing nature.

“Unfortunately, many people encroached on the shoreline and what you see now are the results of the impact,” said Babikwa.

On the same note, Beatrice Anywar, the Uganda State Minister for Environment, told us that most of the structures including Beaches set up around the Lake were illegal.

The Minister revealed that the government is encouraging voluntary migration of the settlement away from the endangered zones of the lake shores, and warned that action will be taken against those who will not leave.

In the same call, Dr. Tom Okurut, the Executive Director for NEMA, advises the affected residents to vacate the natural habitats lest they will be forcefully evicted.

A statement issued by the Ministry of Water and Environment on 1st May, stated that the Lake Victoria water level continues to rise to critical levels despite increased releases due to the increasing inflows and heavy rains in Lake Victoria Basin. At the same time, the Rivers discharging into Lake Victoria from upstream countries have uncontrollably more than doubled their inflows.

The current water levels that started last October (2019), have consistently continued to rise up from 12:00 meters to the current 13:32 meters, the second highest increase recorded since 1964, when the water level rose to 13:46 meters.

What Caused the Rise of Water Level?

Sam Cheptoris, Uganda’s Minister for Water and Environment, explained that Lake Victoria has over 23 rivers flowing into it from the three East African Countries that include Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

According to the Minister, when it rains, an increase in the waters from those rivers results into the direct increase in the water they pour into the largest freshwater lake in the continent.

“Some of these rivers originate from as far as Rwanda and Burundi: therefore, when it rains in those countries, water finds its ways into Lake Victoria,” explained the Minister.

Mr Cheptoris further noted that, “a number of areas around lakes and rivers have been identified as high flood risk areas and essential features such as schools, health facilities and places of worship are at risk.”

Is the Government Taking Any Measures?

In a communication by Minister Cheptoris, the government has put into place a number of measures to help address the problems of the rising water levels and associated floods.

Government has since instituted measures to immediately get water out of Lave Victoria through increased releases at Jinja which is now at the rate of 2200 cubic meters per second, up from the rate of 1000 cubic meters per second in October 2019.

A national Response team comprising the Ministry of Works and Transport, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, Ministry of Defense and Veteran Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries and, Ministry of Water and Environment. The team has ready equipment and Machinery to carry out surveillance and monitoring of the movement of the floating islands and removed those that are considered a threat to the electricity power generation.

The Inter-Ministerial committee has also been set up, under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister, comprising 14 Ministries and seven Agencies to implement Government response to the disaster.

In line to that, a multi-sectoral Technical Task team chaired by the Ministry of Water and Environment provides support to the Inter-Ministerial Committee and has already started on emergency works on: ensuring safety of Hydropower dams, protection of lives and, monitoring and surveillance of water resources and floating islands.

At the time of compiling this report, the lockdown in the country was preventing people from using public means of transport, some businesses such as salons, bars and open access markets were restricted from operation- and potentially putting the survival of the affected people at stake.

Although the number of COVID-19 infections have reached more than 1000, Uganda has continued to register almost 100% recoveries by July, 2020.

Lake Victoria which is shared by three countries; Tanzania (49%), Uganda (45%), and Kenya (6%), hit 1,134.38 metres above mean sea level (mamsl) on May 07. That is a difference of about 1.32 meters and is significant because Lake Victoria is a very shallow lake, especially on the Ugandan side where it averages a depth of just 40 meters.

Lake Victoria lies on an average elevation of 3,720 feet (1,134 meters) above sea level. Kampala is just 1,200 meters above sea level, a difference of about 70 meters. Ggaba, which is 60 meters above at 1,140 meters above sea level, is already inundated.

If the current rate of rise in water levels were to continue, the State House in Entebbe, and Parliament of Uganda in Kampala itself could easily find itself submerged.

Episode 31

About six million people were affected by floods in 2020, from Rwanda to South Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania and beyond. Flooding can lead to disease outbreaks, such as cholera, and damage livelihoods, crops and the environment.

Why have floods become so bad in East Africa, and what can be done to prevent them?

Last Monday, Water and Environment was one of the ministries that presented their performance in the implementation of the 2016 NRM manifesto.

The ministry’s director for water resources management, Dr Florence Grace Odongo, revealed that the water levels on Lake Victoria have risen to 13.4 metres short of 8cm to reach last year’s levels and yet the rainy season has just started. People living on river banks and lake shores were, therefore, warned to vacate the areas before floods begin to rage.

Such warnings have become an annual repetition albeit in good faith as they are meant to avoid loss of lives and property.

Unfortunately, they are usually taken lightly by the audience for whom they are intended.

But then again, these people rightly referred to as encroachers would not even be there in the first place if environment laws were observed. Clearly, there seems to a problem when it comes to implementation of laws.

In a Daily Monitor story of May 14 titled, “Govt issues flood alerts, tells lakeside residents to vacate”, Mr Sam Cheptoris, the minister of Water and Environment, says one of the reasons they have not been able to contain encroachment and destruction of forests and wetlands is because of low enforcement of laws which is exacerbated by the fact that there are few enforcement officers under the environment protection police unit.

In a statement on the rising water levels of Lake Victoria and the Nile system last year in May, Mr Cheptoris directed that people living within the protection zones of wetlands, lakes, rivers, and forest reserves vacate with immediate effect.

He said the ministry was working with the Ministry of Local Government and other government agencies to evict people living within 100 metres of river banks, 30 metres of wetlands and 200 metres of lake shores, and in forest reserves.

He said the respective government offices, from the central to local levels, up to the sub-county and parish levels, has been informed about the directive and requested to take the required actions with immediate effect.

Was there an attempt to implement these directives in spite of the shortage of enforcement officers? What action is being taken against encroachers and how is government making sure that they do not settle in those areas again? How can the communities near the said areas be involved in stopping encroachment?

It would be prudent to present an audit of whether these directives were successfully implemented and if not, what can be done this time to get a better results.

This way, we can avoid repetitions of the same directives year after year with no lasting solutions.

HOIMA- As the country gears up for the reopening of schools for finalists, pupils of Primary Seven at Toonya Primary School in Buseruka sub-county, Hoima district, remain in uncertainty after their school was cut off by floods from Lake Albert.

The floods, which began in early April, have moved inland by over a kilometre from the shore, paralysing the activities of the fishing community on several landing sites.Henry Katalibabo, the Toonya A LCI chairperson, told New Vision that 222 houses, accommodating 1,068 people, have been affecteVd.

""The water levels keep rising. We are worried of the likely destruction of our homes,"" he said. Katalibabo said some pupils will be required to board canoes twice before accessing the area designated to accommodate them.

Moses Kyaligonza, the Toonya Primary School headteacher, said when schools were closed in March, they had 450 pupils with 38 in Primary Seven. Kyaligonza said it would be better to have these children accommodated in one place for their safety because trekking daily from their homes is risky.

Accommodation for teachers is also a big challenge because the flooded school had eight staff quarters. The houses that would have been rented by the teachers have also been affected by floods.

Dr Fredrick Byenume, the Hoima district health inspector, said waterborne diseases such as cholera and dysentery are likely to result from the floods.

""There is no doubt that the water is contaminated with faecal matter because all the pit latrines are filled up by water,"" Byenume said. He said they are planning to distribute chlorine tablets to purify the water as one way of preventing waterborne diseases.Byenume appealed to the public to desist from open defecation to avoid further contamination of the water.He said both the school and Toonya Health Centre III have been declared unfit for human use.

Joselyne Nyangoma, the Hoima district natural resources officer, said the flood waters have brought with them crocodiles and hippopotami, which are a danger to residents.

""You need to be careful with your movements in these flood waters because crocodiles have now left the main lake and settled outside,"" she said.

Dr Charles Kajura, the chairperson of Hoima district disaster management committee, said they had asked parents and school management committees to agree on the best modalities to safeguard the children returning to school.","Thu, 08 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['hoima', 'toonya', 'primary', 'flood', 'pupils', 'uganda', 'uncertainty', 'district', 'crocodiles', 'cut', 'floods', 'water', 'school', 'waters', 'schools']",

Reports say the overflow of two rivers in western Uganda exacerbated the situation, causing buildings to submerge. A major hospital in western Kasese had partly been submerged according to the Red cross.

Betty Mbambu, flood victim spoke to the media: “I had just bought a plot. The flood came and washed away my property, cupboards, mattresses. Right now, we are here trying to see what things of ours we can dig out.

“We woke up and business and the property were destroyed. Right now we are trying to find the remaining properties (items) that could been buried in our house.”

The rains also led to damage of infrastructure, including roads, bridges and several farms were washed away.

In a related development in East Africa, floods have killed 65 people in Rwanda on Thursday and nearly 200 in Kenya last month.

The district and Uganda Red Cross authorities said the deceased included two students, and Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF) soldier, Lothorach Lokwang, attached to the Bwera-based Mountain Brigade.

At least 11 people have been confirmed dead following the new wave of floods that hit the Uganda-DR Congo border district Kasese on Thursday.

Nine of the deaths occurred in Kitholhu sub-county while the other two were killed in Mpondwe-Lhubiriha town council when floods washed them into River Lhubiriha, which burst its banks.

Also River Thako in the Town Council flooded.

The floods were as a result of River Lhubiriha, which borders Uganda and DR Congo along Kitholhu sub-county, in Bukonzo West Constituency. It burst its banks following the overnight torrential rains in Mt Rwenzori.

Uganda is known as the “Pearl of Africa” because of its stunning natural beauty and biodiversity. Its lush vegetation is associated with regular tropical rainfall, but the East African nation is now struggling to deal with more frequent and intense rains that are causing landslides.

Landslides can dump millions of tons of muddy debris in Uganda’s rivers and streams, said Mary Goretti Kitutu, Uganda’s minister of energy and mineral development and an expert on geology and landslides. Such debris can dam rivers, flood surrounding areas, and cause damage to infrastructure.

“The main landslide types [in Uganda] are debris slumps, which occur on concave slopes where water concentrates. Slopes facing northeast are most prone to landslides, which coincide with the dominant rainfall direction,” Kitutu said.

The region’s soil profile is significant, she continued, explaining that “topsoils have a high infiltration rate, which allows fast flow of water into the deeper, clay-rich horizons—promoting water stagnation and causing slope failure.”

Landslide Losses

Although Uganda has always experienced some loss of life due to landslides, the number of casualties has increased this century.

Over the past 25 years, catastrophic landslides have regularly hit the foothills of Mount Elgon, for instance, which straddles the border between eastern Uganda and Kenya. The region’s most devastating landslide swept the slopes in 2010. Although more than 300 people are thought to have perished, only about 100 bodies were recovered. Thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed.

In 2012, a landslide followed 2 days of heavy rains in the same area. At least 18 people were killed, and 15 houses were destroyed. In December 2019, five people died in mudslides following heavy rainfall, 150 houses were destroyed, and the crops of smallholder farmers were swept away.

The most obvious trigger for Uganda’s slump landslides is rainfall. Rainfall events of low intensity but long duration are thought to be the most disastrous, a pattern that is well known among Ugandan farmers.

Callist Tindimugaya, commissioner for water resources planning and regulation in Uganda’s Ministry of Water and Environment, attributed the increase in rainfall to changing climate patterns and rapid loss of forest cover due to trees being cut down to be used as fuel. Tindimugaya said climate change is likely to increase average temperatures in Uganda by up to 1.5°C in the next 20 years and by up to 4.3°C by the 2080s.

“Changes in rainfall patterns and total annual rainfall amounts are also expected,” he added, “but these are less certain than changes in temperature.”

“Rain Has Become My Enemy”

“Rain has become my enemy. When it rains, my heart sinks.” “Rain has become my enemy. When it rains, my heart sinks,” said Gerald Masaba, a coffee farmer in the Bududa District in eastern Uganda.

Masaba said many forests in the area have been turned into farms. The thin topsoil of converted forest often fails to retain water during heavy downpours, increasing the farm’s vulnerability to flood. In addition, terraced agriculture is not popular among farmers “because they believe terraces promote water infiltration, which triggers landslides,” Kitutu added.

Clovis Kabaseke, however, said farmers can be trained on how to successfully engage in terraced agriculture. Kabaseke is a lecturer and researcher in the School of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences at Mountains of the Moon University in Uganda.

Kabaseke said the agricultural method can be effective in maximizing arable land area in variable terrains and reducing soil erosion and water loss, but farmers need to be taught the most effective practices.

Displaced Communities

Alfred Okidi, the permanent secretary in Uganda’s Ministry of Water and Environment, said that in 2020, more than 850 people were permanently displaced by mudslides.

With assistance from partners such as the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Ugandan government was able to safely relocate these displaced people. Okidi said IOM and CERF provided $818,000 in emergency relief.

Musa Ecweru, the state minister for relief and disaster preparedness in the Ugandan cabinet, was hopeful that the relocation would ultimately help build communities and economies. “The landslide victims were settled in Kiryandongo District,” he said, “where each household was given land to farm so that they can move on with their new lives.”

Rosemary Nandudu, however, says the transition will not be easy. Nandudu was relocated from the wet, fertile ecosystem of eastern Uganda to the drier one of the western Kiryandongo District and said the land provided by the government is not fertile. “It has been hard for us to adjust to a dry land, when most crops we used to know and grow cannot grow there,” she said.

Margaret Kemigisa, who grows tea in the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains in western Uganda, said farmers who formerly grew crops such as beans, millet, and bananas have switched to tea. Tea requires heavy seasonal rainfall and is grown at altitudes that are less vulnerable to debris slumps.

“Farmers from Bushenyi, Kanungu, Mityana, Mbale, and Mukono—which are hilly—have been trained to grow tea, which can also be grown in greenhouses provided the soils are acidic,” Kemigisa said.

According to Nandudu, relocated communities also face lifestyle changes. They are unable to keep cattle in the new area and have to buy food, which was not the case in their former self-sufficient community.

Joseph Mafabi, who was relocated to Kiryandongo, had to find a new job in a refugee settlement to make ends meet. “I would have wanted to go back to the Elgon region, but the government is telling us that it is not safe to go back,” he said.

What Is Being Done

Community groups, government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations are working to reduce the frequency of landslides in Uganda, mostly by planting trees in vulnerable areas. In one settlement, a group of more than 100 teenagers began their own tree planting campaign to reduce the chance of future landslides.

Tom Obong Okello, executive director of Uganda’s National Forestry Authority (NFA), said the NFA has started planting trees on the slopes of Elgon to control soil erosion. “We are restoring the lost vegetation and trees to mitigate landslides in the area,” he said.

Trees for the Future, an international nonprofit organization, says it has planted more than 16 million trees in Uganda to help farmers restore their land and mitigate landslides.

David Duli, country director of World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Uganda, said WWF Uganda has helped organize community groups to reforest areas that have been the most affected by landslides. “Forests play a significant role in national development through their contribution to the ecological balance, energy, and industrial activities.…We have formed community groups to replant trees in areas that were affected by landslides, but we also wanted the community to own these initiatives,” Duli said.

Cholera Oral Vaccination 2020

Ministry of Health will next month embark on Cholera vaccination in flood-prone areas following reports of anticipated heavy rains.



Oral Cholera Vaccine is used as part of the Ministry of Health’s Integrated Cholera prevention and control strategy. The others include the provision of safe water, improved sanitation, and high-quality case management.



Dr Joyce Moriku, the State Minister for Primary Health Care, says that the government has imported additional 1 Million vaccines which will be rolled out in May to complete vaccination of those that had earlier received the first dose last year 2020.



//Cue in: “In November 2020…

According to Moriku, the flood-prone districts include Kasese, Busia, Namayingo, Obongi, Madi-Okolo, Ntoroko targeting to reach between 800,000 and one million people. These received the first dose and have been considered high-risk areas to flood reports during the rainy season.



During the floods, the districts face threats of an outbreak of cholera and other water-borne diseases. In Kasese district, River Nyamwamba bursts its banks displacing several people and washing away latrines. The residents also deposit human waste in polythene bags and dump it in the flowing water.



Dr Godfrey Bwire, the Assistant Commissioner of Public Health Emergency, urged the public to also follow preventive guidelines like regular hand washing, opening up drainage channels, drinking boiled water and clearing bushes around their homes.



//Cue in: “To open the…

In September 2018, the government launched a national cholera vaccination campaign that aimed to vaccinate over one million people in cholera prone areas.



Cholera is an infection caused by bacteria and affects the intestines. The main symptoms are watery diarrhoea and vomiting. This may result in dehydration and severe cases of greyish-bluish skin. Transmission occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the faeces of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms.

Gardens, roads, and homes in five sub-counties of Dokolo district have been submerged by the rising water levels of Lake Kwania, making over a thousand families homeless.

The people affected have moved to higher grounds as the devastating floods continue to wreak havoc in the district.

Olga Hope Eriong, a resident of Acungapenyi, Kachung parish in Agwata sub-county says the community whose homes have been submerged by floods is experiencing problems of lack of food and shelter.

She says there is a scarcity of building materials, so they are facing difficulties in constructing new houses.

Middy Amek, a mother of four, whose home was affected says the water level started rising last year and since then, it has covered more than 700 metres inland towards her home.

""I have to leave this place but it's not easy, due to lack of building materials,"" she said.

Karina Akite, a resident of the place says she last witnessed such flooding in 1962 but that time, there was much rain.

The ceremonial ground near her home is all flooded. Dokolo RDC Lawrence Egole said they recently used the ground during a funeral.

Kuranimo Dai, another resident said their homes are greatly affected.

Dai said at night, it's very cold, there're many mosquitoes and snakes. He also said the flood water smells bad.

Nelson Okello, a youthful retail trader in the village said he is being forced out of his home by the flood.

The district chairperson Fredrick Odongo says the floods have affected the sub-counties of Agwata, Adok, Kwera, Adeknino, Okwongdul, and Kangai.

""Last week we went to the sub-counties of Kwera, Adeknino, and Okwongodul and found a number of homes destroyed, gardens flooded, and roads destroyed,"" Odongo said.

He said the road network in the district has been greatly affected and they have to be reconstructed when the flood subsides.

He said in Agwata, where they visited on Monday, they found a similar situation.

""A number of farms and homes have been destroyed,"" Odongo said.

He said they wrote to the office of the Prime Minister who sent a consignment of relief items including 15, 000kg of maize flour, 5000kg of beans, and 50 bundles of tarpaulin.

Odongo added that they have not received 300 pieces of blankets as indicated in a letter dated May 28, 2020, signed by Rose Nakabugo on behalf of the Permanent Secretary.

For the past few days, it has been raining in many parts of the country and as is the unfortunate norm, whenever it rains, many areas including roads flood and are rendered impassable not to mention the destruction of property and sometimes lives. While we might not have control over the rain, we surely should be able to control the after effects.

Year after year, the country grapples with the problem of rain floods which are mainly caused by poor drainage systems, disregard of environmental guidelines such as erecting buildings in swampy areas that are prone to floods, poor garbage disposal which usually blocks drainage systems, in turn hindering passage of water, among others.

The Kampala Capital City Authority 2017 Kampala drainage master plan cites poor design and construction of drains, poor inter connectivity of drains, limited sensitisation of the public, unplanned settlements and poor enforcement mechanisms and mindsets of the people as some of the issues that affect drainage.

In Kampala for instance, the same areas keep flooding every time it rains heavily even for just a few hours, causing an aftermath of traffic jam and in unfortunate circumstances, accidents where people and vehicles are washed away by the floods.

Some of these areas include Industrial Area, where motorists can be seen daring the raging filthy water that takes over road space turning them into mini rivers. Since this is a recurring problem and is almost expected every year, it should be continually planned for and a lasting solution found.

The areas in different parts of the country that are prone to flooding should be identified before the rains start and a plan to prevent the effects of flooding be devised.

We shouldn’t have to keep crying foul about the same problem year in, year out as if it is impossible to solve. We could start with simple steps such as ensuring that man hole covers are intact as these have also been a death trap, especially when rain floods occur.

Then there’s the emphasis on the state of the drainage system. With well-planned and constructed drainage systems, we can alleviate floods.

As has been suggested before by many concerned and expert parties, these systems must undergo regular maintenance which includes unclogging and revaluating their ability and effectiveness to serve their purpose as the water volumes may keep increasing.

Better planning for urban settlement, harvesting rain water, respecting the natural water catchment areas are also probable steps to take.

While we appreciate that some work has been done to alleviate floods in some areas, more has to be done as the rain and consequent floods wait for no man.","Mon, 15 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.monitor.co.ug/resource/blob/3292088/9f8f53425beb42c7b5cb1151b22090c6/editpix-data.jpg,"['solution', 'areas', 'lets', 'kampala', 'lasting', 'drainage', 'rain', 'rains', 'floods', 'systems', 'water', 'poor', 'problem']",

People living in flooded areas or water lodged conditions are at risk of suffering from waterborne diseases like diarrhoea, dysentery, cholera, etc.

KALAKI - Rising water levels on Lake Kyoga have ravaged three sub-counties in Kalaki district, leaving over 1,400 people helpless.

Scores of residents have fled their homes for safety. Some stay with relatives, while others have rented small units in trading centres.

The LC1 chairperson of Akura village in Kakure sub-county, Kalaki district, Charles Ochung, said the water levels started rising five months ago, but residents did not take it seriously.

Ochung said the most affected sub-counties are Kalaki, Bululu and Kakure.

Florence Engoru, a resident of Akura village, said the rising waters have paralysed transport since roads have been cut off.

Engoru said children in candidate classes from the affected sub-counties were finding it hard to access schools and are worried about how they will sit their examinations.

Engoru said she realised earlier that water levels were going up and left the village before the situation could get worse.

Those who remained behind are now crying out for assistance to be evacuated as more homes get submerged.

Another resident, Rogers Ajaro, said pregnant mothers are finding it hard to access antenatal services and the nearby areas have started reporting cases of waterborne diseases.","Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['started', 'kalaki', 'subcounties', 'waterborne', 'rising', 'resident', 'residents', 'floods', 'uganda', 'water', 'levels', 'ravaged', 'village']",

• The June to September 2020 seasonal rains over the northern and western sector of the region were above average across much of the region. Devastating floods occurred at the peak of the rainfall season, affecting over 2.5 million people and causing significant crop damage in riverine areas in Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, Ethiopia,

Somalia, Uganda, and Kenya.

• Crop losses were significant in several riverine areas, including along the Awash River in Ethiopia, the While and Blue Nile Rivers in South Sudan and Sudan, and the Juba and Shabelle Rivers in Somalia.

Outside of flood-affected areas, the seasonal rains were generally beneficial for crop and livestock production, water availability, and hydro-power generation across East Africa. The water-levels in major lakes, rivers, and dams are among the highest on record, especially in the Lake Victoria basin, major Rift Valley lakes, and White and Blue Nile Rivers.

• Desert locust swarms continue to form, and breeding is underway in Ethiopia, north-central Somalia, Yemen, and eastern Sudan. The situation in Ethiopia is of high concern, where government and other sources report significant damage to meher crops in Amhara, Tigray, and Oromia regions.

• Rangeland resources and livestock production conditions are exceptionally above average across most pastoral and agropastoral regions of East Africa due to two consecutive rainfall seasons of above average rainfall performance since late 2019. However, atypically high disease prevalence and livestock deaths are reported in South Sudan due to severe floods in 2019 and 2020.

• The 1-2 weeks rainfall outlook depicts the gradual southward shift of the tropical rainfall system from the northern to equatorial sectors. This marks a timely onset of the seasonal rains in bimodal South Sudan and Uganda, while the rains will gradually subside and reduce the risk of associated flooding in Sudan, unimodal South Sudan, Yemen, and Ethiopia. However, much of eastern Horn is expected to remain sunny and dry, with a delayed and erratic onset of the short/deyr rains in eastern Ethiopia and southern Somalia.","Sat, 10 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1539740-EAST_AFRICA_Seasonal_Monitor_2020_09_06_final.png?itok=kRTluo5N,"['africa', 'significant', 'south', 'seasonal', 'rainfall', 'livestock', 'rivers', '2020', 'east', 'yemen', 'monitor', 'ethiopia', 'sudan', 'rains', 'world']",

NAKASONGOLA- Flash floods have submerged a section of the Lwampanga Health Centre IV in Nakasongola District, paralysing normal operations at the maternity unit.

Currently, expectant mothers are unable to access antenatal services at the medical centre.

The floods have displaced about 717 people in the district and many of them are camping at schools and churches.

Nakasongola District Health Officer, Dr Agaba Byamukama, said at the weekend that water from the flooding Lake Kyoga has forced administrators of the health centre to temporarily shift particular services antenatal services to a safer area.

“The floods have partly inconvenienced normal service delivery because several families have been displaced and forced to seek shelter in areas that are far from the health centre,” Dr Agaba said.

He said that sanitation facilities like pit-latrines at the health facility have been flooded which could trigger water-borne diseases.","Mon, 06 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['health', 'hundreds', 'forced', 'nakasongola', 'dr', 'normal', 'district', 'services', 'displaced', 'floods', 'uganda', 'displace', 'centre', 'antenatal']",

The situation

Within a month (August to September) 2020, more than 1.21 million people in 12 different countries have been affected by floods across Africa and many other countries are currently experiencing more widespread rainfall than usual in the long rain season leading to transboundary flooding in several areas. Countries most affected by floods during the last five weeks are; Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Kenya, Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Mali. More countries are in trajectories of being affected by floods during the monsoon season which will continue till November. A brief overview of the situation is given below:

In Sudan, 17 of the country's 18 states have been affected, with North Darfur, Sennar, West Ordofan, and Kassala being the worst affected. More than 0.5 million people have been affected and 99 people have lost their lives and over 100,000 houses have been damaged. Thirty-four (34) schools and 2,671 health facilities have also been damaged. It has also been stated that the magnitude of rain and floods this year exceeds the 1988 and 1946 floods. The affected families are seeking shelter with relatives and host communities. Following a meeting with the Council of Ministers, the Security and Defence Council in Sudan has declared a state of emergency for three months in the whole country and formation of a higher committee to mitigate the effects of the floods

In South Sudan, over 600,000 people were displaced by floods according to the United Nations (UN). Flooding along the White Nile has affected four counties in six states since July 2020. Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding in vast areas and settlements along the White Nile in the center of the country, with the states of Jonglei and Lakes being the worst affected. According to a Rapid Needs Assessment, priorities include water, purification tablets, plastic sheeting for temporary shelter, mosquito nets, fishing kits, and medicines for Malaria, Diarrhea and other waterborne diseases

In Kenya, rains led to the displacement of over 100,000 people and 194 people lost their lives. In Ethiopia, rains affected over 200,000 people and caused 8 deaths. Flooding in Uganda saw 5,000 people displaced and 6 deaths with 3,800 people on the Lake Islands in Mayuga District evacuated due to an increased water level in Lake Victoria.

According to the Niger Red Cross Society and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), in Niger, more than 88,000 people have been affected by floods in 8 regions of Niger – Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Niamey, Tahoua, Tillaberi and Zinder – with 33 deaths and 9,568 houses collapsed. Many people have been displaced and had to seek refuge in schools and host families.

In Chad, almost 120,000 people have been displaced by floods during the August 2020 rains. According to a report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 32,000 of those displaced were in N’Djamena, where 10 people lost their lives. Previously, 1,000 homes on the Maingama Site were damaged, forcing 430 households to flee their destroyed homes.

Also affected are the areas of Bugoigo, Kamagongoro, Kigungu, Serule, Piida, Waisoki, Triangle and Magali in Butiaba Sub-county, Kabolwa and Kigoya landing sites in Kigoya sub-county. In Kagadi district, the floods have swept through the areas of Kabukanga, Rwebigongoro, Nkuse and Ndaiga.



Those affected in Hoima are Tonya, Kijangi, Kaiso, Rwentali, Hoimo, Fofo, Mbegu, Waaki and Kiryamboga among others, while the affected areas in Kikuube include Nkondo, Sebigoro, Ususa, Senjojo, Wangjok, Busiki and Nsonga.



Andrew Byakutaga, the Bunyoro Kitara Kingdom Prime Minister says the situation has gone out of hand, and that the government needs to intervene and save the lives of people that are now at risk. The flood victims are currently occupying churches and schools, whole others are sleeping in the cold.

Francis Kazini, the Kikuube LCV Chairperson wonders why the government has not taken appropriate action to have the flood victims relocated.



In August, The Bunyoro Kitara Kingdom petitioned the government to immediately extend relief food to thousands of people affected by floods in the region. The petition followed an assessment of the destruction undertaken across the various landing sites by Kingdom officials led by Byakutaga.","Wed, 11 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://ugandaradionetwork.net/a/helpers/image.php?fileId=234960&m=0&w=960&h=960,"['radionetwork', 'immediate', 'kitara', 'areas', 'bunyoro', 'victims', 'relocation', 'demands', 'landing', 'district', 'affected', 'floods', 'uganda', 'flood', 'wanseko', 'districts', 'buliisa', 'kingdom']",

• The March to May (MAM) rainfall period was one of the wettest the region has seen since 1981 (Figure 1), following an already record wet 2019 October to December (OND) rainfall period.

• The early onset of rains and above-average rainfall since February promoted land preparation and planting activities for the MAM season across Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, along with the Belg season in Ethiopia.

• However, the abundant rains have also caused localized flooding, mudslides, flashfloods, and river overflows over the past months causing casualties, population displacement, infrastructure damage, and crop damage in parts of Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and Yemen.

• Cropping conditions remain generally favourable as rains are expected to be beneficial to planting and crop development across much of the region; however, localized losses and crop damage are expected in areas worst affected by flooding (Figure 2).

• Abundant rains have also promoted the breeding and development of desert locusts and protracted the outbreak across the region, which continues to pose a significant threat to main season crops.

• Above-average rainfall is expected to continue across much of the region through May which will increase the flood risk across many areas and further protract the desert locust outbreak (See May Outlook Pg. 8).","Tue, 19 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1518254-Special_Report_East_Africa_202005.png?itok=2ce-Vf7E,"['africa', 'crop', 'rainfall', 'east', 'uganda', 'updated', 'flood', '2020', 'rains', 'tanzania', 'special', 'expected', 'season', 'report', 'damage', 'region', 'agriculture', 'impacts', 'somalia']",

Torrential rains have triggered devastating floods and landslides across East Africa in recent weeks, aggravating an already challenging situation as countries in the region battle the coronavirus pandemic.

The destruction caused by the heavy rainfall has killed hundreds of people in Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Rwanda and Ethiopia and has also forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.

This week, officials in Kenya and Rwanda said nearly 200 and 65 people had died in both countries, respectively, with floodwaters and mudslides destroying houses, washing away bridges and straining critical infrastructure.

On Saturday, Kenyan and Uganda suffered nationwide electricity outages, leaving tens of millions of people without power.

Health experts are worried about the implications of the flooding on the countries’ response to the coronavirus pandemic.

“This is compounding the COVID-19 response,” Kenya Health Ministry Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman said.

“The displaced people have been forced to congregate in makeshift camps with the risk of banding together exposing them to the possibility of contracting the virus.”

Floodwaters also recently swept away most parts of an entire small town in Somalia and swept away roads, bridges and a hospital in Uganda.

Heavy rains flooded areas around Mountain Rwenzori in western Uganda after Nyamwamba River burst its banks, forcing people to seek refuge in nearby schools and destroying roads and bridges, according to officials.

“What complicates the matter is that this is the era of COVID. People are expected to maintain social distance, but how do you maintain distance in such a situation?” Julius Mucunguzi, spokesman for the prime minister’s office, was quoted as saying by the Reuters News Agency.

One of the hospitals in the area, Kilembe, was also washed away despite being built on a raised bank and reinforced with sandbags.

“There are wards which were completely washed away. The mortuary was swept away. You wouldn’t know that once upon a time there was a mortuary there. The drugs and drug stores were washed away,” Mucunguzi said.

The Somali region in eastern Ethiopia has also been hard hit by the floods, with more than 100,000 people displaced, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

Meanwhile, an unspecified number of people were killed in the semi-autonomous Puntland region in Somalia when flash floods swept away most buildings in Qardho town, officials said.

The heavy rains stem from moisture dumped in the region by winds coming in from the Indian Ocean where temperatures have risen in recent months, said Chris Shisanya, a professor of climatology at Kenyatta University in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.

“This is a carry-over of what we had last year,” he said, referring to floods and landslides in the region.

The floods are coming as swarms of locusts are wreaking havoc across East Africa where millions of people struggle for food.

Billions of desert locusts have already chomped their way through Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti, Eritrea, Tanzania, Sudan and Uganda.

Africa Weather Hazards

Desert locust remain present across East Africa and continue migrating across Kenya, Sudan, and South Sudan.

Continued below-average rainfall over Liberia, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, and Nigeria has led to abnormal dryness.

Heavy rainfall during July and August has caused flooding along the Niger River basin and northern Nigeria. Heavy rainfall is forecast across western Africa next week increasing risks for additional flooding.

Heavy rainfall since July has caused significant flooding across Eritrea and the Afar region of Ethiopia. Forecast heavy rainfall next week will maintain a high flood risk.

Two of its biggest plants, the 180-megawatt Nalubaale and 200-megawatt Kiira plants outside Jinga, are being battered by rising flood waters and floating papyrus.

On April 14, a floating mass of papyrus mats (used across Lake Victoria and now cast afloat like islands) crunched into the dam wall. Bits of papyrus were sucked into the turbines. The country was plunged into a blackout as around 20% of the grid’s capacity suddenly went offline.

The story of that moment started six months earlier, in October, when it started raining in Uganda. It hasn’t stopped since. Lake Victoria’s levels have risen by 1.3m and are just 8cm away from their highest-ever level. Similar downpours filled the lake in the early 1960s and mid 1990s.

With 23 rivers feeding the lake and only one exit, past Jinga and into the Nile, Lake Victoria is perfect for hydropower. To help alleviate the pressure, the amount of water being released at Jinja has more than doubled.

But this isn’t just an issue of too much rain. Human expansion has played a large role.

In a press release detailing the government response, Uganda’s water and environment minister, Sam Cheptoris, said a loss of forest cover as well as encroachment on wetlands and river banks meant that there was more silt in the lake and fewer natural barriers to fast-flowing flood waters. Towns and roads also mean more cement and tar, so rainwater doesn’t soak into the ground and instead goes straight into rivers.

The higher water levels have meant jetties and landing sites being submerged, leading to a halt in ferries. The floating mats have also become a hazard to other shipping; so vital to local economies. Resorts, hotels and homes have been flooded. The flooding is also affecting Lake Kyoga, with flooding at a much lower level in Lake Albert.

Cheptoris noted that drinking water and sanitation systems have also been affected by the deluge, with a likely increase in water-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, malaria and bilharzia.

In response to the crisis, Cheptoris said the government will “remove” anyone encroaching on water bodies and forests. Chiefs who have not taken “action against encroachers” will also be dismissed.

By John Marsham and colleagues

A year of exceptional rainfall, floods and locust outbreaks is decreasing the resilience of vulnerable populations in East Africa just at the time of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The combination of these disasters is not random, as the floods, lake level and locusts can all been linked to climate change.

Covid-19 is a zoonotic virus, which means it has been transmitted from animals to humans. The illegal global trade in wild animals (notably Pangolins, which are largely exported to China) has been directly damaging East Africa’s ecology for years and, even if not yet proven to be the case for Covid-19, such trade increases the chance of zoonotic pandemics.

Water levels of Lake Victoria have just reached the highest point ever in the 120 year record, displacing thousands and flooding infrastructure.

Other floods in the region have displaced tens of thousands of people and killed hundreds. The locust outbreak is the worst in 70 years and may, according to the UN, grow 400-fold by June.

Combined, these increase vulnerability and reduce the ability of the population to engage in social distancing and to practise basic hygiene just as the Covid-19 crisis hits East Africa.

The Lake Victoria basin is home to around 40 million people. The lake is the largest tropical lake in the world and its outflow is a major hydropower source.

The lake has major cities of around 5 million people on its shores, including Kampala, the capital of Uganda.

Lake Victoria is unusual in that it receives most of its water directly from rainfall, not from rivers, and loses most by evaporation, rather than through its outflow: the lake level has varied by around 3m over the last 120 years.

The rise in Lake Victoria levels is one of the fastest on record. East Africa has experienced major flooding since October 2019.

The exceptional 2019 rainfall was caused by warm waters in the western Indian Ocean (called a positive “Indian Ocean Dipole”, which also contributed to the Australian fires). Together with effects of tropical cyclones and westerlies between October and December this led to the Lake Victoria basin experiencing 150 to 200% of its usual rainfall.

January and February 2020 also had above average rain, possibly related to persistent warm water in the western Indian Ocean. Climate change is expected to have increased the probability of these events and so the rapid lake level rise. March to May 2020 have seen further heavy rainfall, pushing up lake levels to the near record-breaking level.

Although we do expect climate change to favour such rapid rises in lake level, it is too early to say for certain whether we expect climate change to give higher or lower lake levels overall in the long term.

It is clear though that water management plans must plan for changes due to climate change, such as the recent rapid rise.

The fact that Lake Victoria spans three nations, and is a source of the White Nile that then supplies water to South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt, means that plans for Lake Victoria have international implications, so agreements and plans should be made well in advance, to allow adequate time to address the complex issues this will raise.

Climate change will continue to intensify rainfall and flood management must adapt.

The event illustrates how ‘natural disasters’, sometimes enhanced by climate change, are often interconnected. The exceptional rain of 2019/2020 has led to flooding directly from the rainfall, as well as from rivers and the lake, and has been linked to disease outbreaks.

The weather has affected crop growth and food prices, and has contributed to the locust outbreak. People in the region are suffering impacts of these events and Covid-19 simultaneously, or in quick succession, reducing their ability to cope, and acute food insecurity is growing.

Projected impacts of climate change on populations and ecosystems, and plans to increase resilience, must account for such systematic sequences of inter-connected events, as well as random sequencing of unrelated disasters.

The work reported on in this story is part of two projects: (1) FCFA’s HyCRISTAL project (funded by DFID and NERC) which is working to both improve climate information for East Africa, and use this to inform long-term decision making in the region, (2) HyTpp (funded by DFID, through the Corridors for Growth Trust Fund administered by the World Bank), which is analysing possible Lake Victoria water levels under climate change.

More than 10,000 people who were displaced by the recent floods in Kasese District face starvation amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Kasese District Covid-19 taskforce is facing a hard time enforcing the Ministry of Health and Presidential directives aimed at stemming the spread of the pandemic in the 27 camps.

Kasese District was on May 7 and 22 hit by floods when five rivers; Lhubiriha, Mubuku, Nyamwamba, Nyamughasana and Sebwe burst their banks and affected communities in seventeen sub-counties as well as Bulembia and Nyamwamba Divisions in Kasese Municipality.

Speaking to Daily Monitor in an interview at the weekend, Mr Joshua Kisembo Masereka, the Kasese Deputy Resident District Commissioner, said the state of people living in camps scattered across various sub-counties is appalling.

“Those living in camps are traumatised and are faced with emotional and mental stress emanating from the losses they registered at an individual level,” he said.

The camps housing stranded people include; Kanyangeya, Nkaiga and Kiraro primary schools having the highest number of people concentrated in one place.

When *Daily Monitor *visited one of the camps at Kiraro Primary School, no one was seen wearing a facemask.\ Despite presence of a hand washing facility that the taskforce have improvised, no one was seen washing hands.

Mr Peter Mutooro, the camp chairperson, said they have failed to enforce the directives against Covid-19 because they are facing hunger.

""Because of Covid-19, we have started decongesting families to the nearby churches and schools so that they reduce on the numbers,"" said Mr Mutooro.

Ms Harriet Kabugho, who chairs the committee overseeing affairs for girls within the camp, said their rights as girls were being violated every day. She explained that five of her friends have been sexually harassed by the boys within the same camp.

""We do not have bathrooms, we use the same latrines and we might contract sexually transmitted diseases,"" Ms Kabugho said.

The coordinator for Centre for Gender Quality, a non-governmental organisation based in Kasese town, Ms Jolly Mbambu, advised that people who are living in camps need to be resettled.

""This will not be the first time government is resettling flood victims. It was properly done during the Bududa landslides saga,"" Ms Mbambu said.

Damage

A tentative impact assessment by the district disaster committee that was presented to the State Minister for Disaster Preparedness, Mr Musa Ecweru, in May indicates that a total of 123,800 people, most of them women and children from more than 24,760 households have been directly affected by the floods.

The most affected areas include Kilembe, Karambi, Bugoye, Maliba, Mpondwe Lhubiriha Town Council, Karusandara, Kyarumba, Mubuku Town Council and the three divisions of Kasese Municipality.","Mon, 08 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flash-flood.png,"['living', 'town', 'starvation', 'mr', 'victims', 'district', 'covid19', '10000', 'kasese', 'affected', 'camps', 'uganda', 'ms', 'washing', 'face', 'flood']",

More than 150 families, part of the 10,000 people who were displaced by the floods two years ago after water levels in Lake Albert rose, are living in a dire condition.

The lives of many locals who have gathered in Kanara Sub-county, Ntoroko District near Lake Albert, are being threatened since the temporal houses erected in water are on the verge of collapsing. The families are also in dire need of food and other essential basic needs.

The unstable houses, made of iron sheets, and reeds are being held by timber poles erected in water, some of which are rotting away and can no longer hold their weight.

Mr Justice Kabagambe,46, a resident of Kamuga Village in Kanara Sub-county, Ntoroko District, one of the affected people, in April last year erected a temporary house above the water after his house that is a few metres away from the shores of Lake Albert, was submerged by floods.

Following the incident, he joined another family whose house was submerged days later. “I decided to build a temporary four-room house where I am staying with my family,” he said.

“The family is not sure of a single meal in a day but we get support from friends and well-wishers. My house is not stable and it shakes whenever it gets windy, especially at night, we fear it may collapse,” Mr Kabagambe added.

Mr Kabagambe’s house is surrounded by 40 others in the same condition. The houses are hard to access and one has to use a boat as a means of transport to visit friends and family members settled away from the flooded area. Similarly, food and other requirements are transported by boat from the dry areas. The operators of the few available boats demand a fee for their services.

There are a few makeshift shops built above the flooded areas. Mr Kabagambe’s family is forced to keep indoors since they have no compound.

The communities also lack clean water for domestic use and are forced to draw contaminated water from the lake.

The families lack toilets too and are forced to defecate in the water. “We use the same water to ease ourselves since our toilets and tap stands were submerged,” Mr Kabagambe said.

His plight is shared by more than 150 families who have found shelter above the water.

The sub-counties that are mostly affected include Kamuga, Kachwakumu and Rwangara. The affected families are, however, holding on to hope that the government will come to their rescue.

Those who were displaced in 2019 and later in 2020, were first sheltered in nearby schools of Umoja, Rwangara and Kachwakumu, which were later submerged. The floods left homes, shops, schools, gardens and health facilities submerged.

Last year when the State minister for Disaster Preparedness and Refugees, Mr Musa Ecweru, and other officials visited the area, local leaders requested government to relocate them to Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve.

Current situation

The chairperson of Kachwakumu Village, Mr Rwaheru Byaruhanga, said while some people sought refuge with friends and family, others have nowhere to go.

He said more than 200,000 houses are still submerged and only rooftops are seen floating on top of water. “People spend days indoors and school-going children have not reported to school because their schools were submerged. Our people have also risked their lives because any time, these makeshift houses may collapse. They will also contract disease because they use contaminated water,” Mr Byaruhanga said.

Lack of food

Ntoroko District’s main economic activity is fishing and cattle keeping. The livelihood of locals was greatly hit since the floods affected livestock farming.

Accessing health centres is also a big challenge and they have to hire boats to reach Butungama or Rwebisengo sub-county for medical service. The nearby Rwangara Health Centre III was submerged.

Dr James Kato, the officer-in-charge of Rwebisengo Health Centre III, said they have to travel long distances to pick drugs.

Mr Byaruhanga said since 2019, they have been requesting the government to relocate them to Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve.

The chairperson of Kanara Sub-county, Mr Friday Mugiisa, said they have never received any relief food.

“People who are stuck in floods have no food to eat and they have been depending on fish. Last month, the UPDF fishing unit on Lake Albert destroyed all boats after accusing our people of illegal fishing,” Ms Mugiisa said.

The Ntoroko County Member of Parliament, Mr Gerald Rwemurikya Ibanda, last year told Daily Monitor that the government had promised to relocate the displaced people and settle them at Tooro Semliki Wildlife Reserve. This has not been fulfilled.

“The acres they are talking about are not enough, but sadly, they haven’t been availed to the people,” he said.

The acting chairperson of Ntoroko District, Mr Ben Muthahinga, said they recently received some relief items such as beans, posho and blankets from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), which they want to distribute to displaced people.

He said last week, the Minister for Tourism, Mr Tom Butiime, was in the area to discuss the relocation plan.

Mr Butiime confirmed that he visited Rwebisengo Town Council and held a meeting with local leaders and they agreed that Uganda Wildlife Authority reduces the restrictions on cattle keepers so that they can graze their animals in certain parts of the park.

He said the restrictions will only be applicable for farmers who have cattle but not for people who want to construct shelters in the park.

The Tourism boss also said the affected locals are being registered by the sub-county chief and they will soon be allowed to graze in the park.

Mr Julius Muchunguzi, the head of communications at the OPM, said: “The government is in the process of identifying land where the affected people can be relocated to. We have been supporting them with relief food.”

The landslides hit several sub-counties with most affected being Buwali and Bukalasi/Bundesi, Bumayoka and parts of Bubiita in the lower stream being affected by flash floods. As a direct consequence of these heavy rains, a total of four (4) major landslides occurred in Bududa: one in Bumayoka subcounty, one in Bukalasi/ Bundesi and two in Buwali. The landslides caused six (6) deaths, and injuries to 27 persons (13 males & 14 females) with all still admitted at Bududa Hospital. Amongst the injured, two (2) are children under 5 years (1 male and 1 female). First rapid assessments identified eighty (80) households as displaced (480 people), out of the 100 affected households and 669 people affected. In the neighbouring Sironko District, along the Mount Elgon slope, a devastating flood incident occurred in Buyobo Sub-County on 4th of June at around 4:00am. The continuous rains that started at 2:20am and continued consecutively for hours triggered flooding from uphill, which carried a huge mass of soil down the hills into river Bugibuni, prompting it to burst its banks and causing havoc to the communities downhill. The river carried massive water, logs of huge trees, soil debris down the slope and swept off houses and crops adjacent to it. The flash floods damaged houses of 111 households, with a population of 426 persons. Fortunately, no deaths were registered. Crops, merchandise, animals and properties worth millions of shillings were destroyed by the floodwaters. (IFRC, 24 Jun 2019)

WWF Country Director David Duri (L) During a press conference at their offices in Kamwokya Kampala--

The number of people drowning due to flooding is projected to increase as Kampala city faces a shocking rise in climate change-related risks. This is according to a report; the water risk scenarios estimate research conducted by the World Wide Fund for Nature.



Launched ahead of the World Cities’ Day 2020, marked today, the reports puts Kampala on the list of 100 other cities that are expected to suffer the greatest rise in water risk problems by 2050. The risks include flooding, drowning, prolonged hot seasons and water scarcity, among others.



The report further reveals that Kampala faces the 7th highest increase in the water risks above for cities across Africa with a 10 per cent rise by the year 2050. WWF country director David Duri observes an urgent need to reclaim the preserve of urban wetlands to save the city from a high price resulting from worsening water risks.



Human activity and the destruction of wetlands has over the years been highlighted as the main cause of flooding in the city, even after light rains. Flooding is mainly seen in the city suburbs of Kyambogo-Banda, Kabuusu, Kinawataka, Kyebando-Nsooba, Bwaise, Namungoona, Nalukolongo, parts of Kasubi, Katanga, Katwe, Namasuba, Zana, and even in the city centre.



Duri mentioned Bugolobi Wetlands, Nakivubo channel, Mayanja wetland along Mityana road and others which have been encroached on, raising the risk of uncontrollable water scenarios on people’s lives and their businesses.

The natural disaster is just one of several challenges facing the region, including continuing invasions by locust swarms and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Countries affected include Rwanda, Kenya, Somalia, Burundi, Ethiopia, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti and Tanzania.

“In some areas, the lack of infrastructure or damage to roads, bridges and airstrips has made accessing flood zones far more difficult, which in turn makes it more difficult to provide assistance,” said Matt Davis, the East Africa regional director of the Catholic Relief Services.

He told Crux the crises affecting East Africa can all be linked back to climate change.

“To help prevent floods in the future and mitigate the impact, we need to make more concerted efforts to preserve and restore watersheds and landscapes. We need to support communities to improve their livelihoods while restoring and maintaining the natural environment,” Davis said.

What follows are excerpts of his conversation with Crux.

Crux: Widespread flooding has once again hit East Africa. Can you give us a sense of the enormity of the disaster?

Davis: East Africa has been experiencing torrential rains and flooding since July and almost six million people have been impacted. Around 1.5 million people have lost their homes or have been displaced by the floods and many areas are still underwater. People’s homes, crops, livestock and personal possessions have been washed away, and there has been significant damage to infrastructure.

This is all happening before the start of the short rains, which should peak in November. In some areas, the lack of infrastructure or damage to roads, bridges and airstrips has made accessing flood zones far more difficult, which in turn makes it more difficult to provide assistance. This flooding is putting hardship upon hardship for people in the region, who have also been impacted by COVID-19 and pests like desert locusts.

Catholic Relief Services is on the ground working with local partners and national governments to distribute emergency food and other necessities. Working in partnership, we’ve been providing life-saving assistance to tens of thousands of people across affected areas.

However, there is an urgent need for more funding to ensure that basic needs continue to be met, and to prevent the spread of malaria and other waterborne diseases. Though our response varies country-by-country, we are generally support families with food, water, shelter, basic essentials, sanitation, and providing cash or vouchers which in turn supports the local economy. We also support health systems to address things like malnutrition and other health-related risks. In some areas, families receive seeds, tools and fishing kits so they can have a livelihood and feed themselves.

How do these flood compare to previous flooding in the region?

Even if you just look at the floods over the last four years, the impacts and the number of people affected have grown exponentially. From Ethiopia to South Sudan to Uganda, we’re seeing communities that year after year are impacted by both floods as well as recurring drought in some places.

Our staff in various countries often comments on how weather patterns have changed, or how rain is erratic. They also say that this is the worst flooding they have seen in decades.

Many environmentalists and other experts are blaming climate change.

The locust swarms, floods, recurring drought and COVID-19 all link back to climate change in some way, and East Africa in particular is feeling the effects.

To help prevent floods in the future and mitigate the impact, we need to make more concerted efforts to preserve and restore watersheds and landscapes. We need to support communities to improve their livelihoods while restoring and maintaining the natural environment. Alternatives to charcoal, a big reason for deforestation, need to be scaled up and promoted more widely. We also have to prioritize to support communities to protect forests and plant trees.

It’s difficult to protect against some of the risks, but there are measures that can be taken to help people cope with disasters like droughts and floods that have been made worse by climate change.

For example, it’s important to ensure that people live far enough away from rivers and channels to prevent disasters like flash flooding and landslides while also better managing excess runoff.

In East Africa, we’re increasing our efforts toward landscape restoration and re-greening while at the same time providing people with a more diverse set of income opportunities and training on how to be better prepared should disaster strike.

As you said, the floods are coming amid the COVID-19 pandemic and a series of locusts swarms. This really is a triple crisis.

The combined impacts of the floods, recurrent drought, conflict, desert locust swarms, COVID-19 and the pandemic-related economic downturn are making it really hard for people to recover. Like here, months-long lockdowns also mean that many people in the region haven’t been able to work, thus losing their ability to put food on the table.

For governments and humanitarian organizations like CRS, this also creates additional strain on already scarce resources. For example, the teams sent out to manage pests like desert locusts have to take additional precautions because of coronavirus. In some remote areas, people have not even heard of the coronavirus and are not aware of the potential risk. There are a lot of misconceptions, creating more risk for frontline workers.

Early on when COVID-19 emerged as a threat in the region, we adjusted how we interacted with project participants so we could continue to provide critical support while adhering to the necessary safety precautions. So, while we had to adapt quickly, we have also largely managed to continue our emergency responses, like food or cash distributions, for example.

For example, in South Sudan, we haven’t been able to do food air drops because airstrips have been flooded. And hunger is growing because farmland is flooded, too.

In terms of COVID-19, overall, our donors have been really flexible and supportive, encouraging us to continue to provide critical support in the communities where we work. That said, funding for a large-scale COVID-19 response has not really materialized, so communities have mostly had to make do with what they had, and weather the pandemic as best they can.","Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cruxnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1000-3-5.jpeg,"['africa', 'crisis', 'food', 'support', 'east', 'massive', 'covid19', 'hit', 'communities', 'need', 'floods', 'flooding', 'latest', 'difficult']",

But the flood water has not receded, the people are still marooned and now they are facing severe hunger.

Unusually heavy rains began last July, and the White Nile burst its banks, destroyed all the crops and encroached on farms and villages, affecting Jonglei and other states, leaving people to scramble for a few strips of dry land.

Fields are still submerged, mud homes and stiff sticks of dead maize are slowly collapsing into the water, entire villages have been abandoned and large areas turned into swamps. Of the 62 villages served by Old Fangak’s central market, 45 are devastated by the flooded river.

The July harvest would have fed the local people through to this spring but all the crops were lost. Families sleep in abandoned schools or in the open on scraps of higher land. There is no question of migrating to dry areas as the flood extends for miles and at least Old Fangak is secluded from the constant conflict that besets much of the rest of the country.

The UN says that about 1.6 million people have been affected by the floods in a country where already at least 7.5 million people need assistance. A recent report by the Integrated food security Phase Classification, (IPC), an initiative by 15 organisations to tackle malnutrition, estimates that 6.4 million people, about half the population, will face acute food insecurity in 2021, and for half of them their lack of food will be an emergency.

Some people in South Sudan, such as those from Old Fangak, are partially or completely cut off from humanitarian aid. Access to the town is difficult in normal times, but the detritus of the floods has blocked the airstrip, which was cleared from the bush, and boat access from the river.

Data from South Sudan suggests that more erratic and unpredictable weather patterns are now the norm.

The floods were caused by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), also known as the “Indian El Niño, a weather pattern discovered only in 1999. The strongest IOD to strike east Africa in 61 years happened in 2019. So when the rains arrived in 2020 in South Sudan, the water from the previous year had not yet receded, resulting in more devastating floods. This year’s rainfall could further worsen the situation, making the resultant hunger catastrophic.

“People will die of hunger. Everyone in Old Fangak is lacking food and lost what they cultivated. Hunger is the one that will kill people,” says Peter Kak, a fisherman and grandfather of five who lives on a grass island with his son Samuel. The two men stayed behind after sending the rest of the family to higher ground. Here, they fish every day.

“Flooding, conflict, Covid-19 and poverty make the situation here dire,” says Sulaiman Sesay, of Action Against Hunger, one of the few aid organisations active in this area of South Sudan. “The world needs to know that people are suffering in this way.”

The socioeconomic measures adopted in response to the pandemic have affected already critical hunger situations in vulnerable places such as South Sudan. A joint report by the World Food Programme and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that threatening global hunger levels seem to be reaching new highs.

In Old Fangak people grew sorghum, a cereal that is easy to cultivate. Now they can eat only water lilies and fish. But not everyone has fishing nets and for those who do the catches are rarely enough to satisfy the appetite.

“There’s not enough sorghum, so we have to resort to the water lily,” explains Samuel Gai. The flowers have to be collected in great numbers to grind and make a small amount of cereal.

Despite the severity of the floods, the people of Old Fangak refuse to give up. In the face of rising waters, hunger and isolation from the rest of the country, the community shows extraordinary resilience.

“We cooperate,” says Joseph Martin, a villager helping to repair the constantly collapsing airstrip dyke. “The women take the water out with buckets and we put the mud on the dykes to prevent water leaking in. They do their part and we do our part.

“When there is work, men and women work together and they cooperate. Some of the people come and work even without us asking them … this is how we do it, if there is work to save the town, we work together,.”

Moving water by the bucketload all day takes a huge toll on hungry people. “Because of this water, I’ve lost weight. We are doing this alone, all day and night throwing water over the dyke. Nobody comes to help us. We are all exhausted,” says Nyayen Chuol, who works on the dyke with her elderly mother.

Where dykes have already been breached many people move on to neighbours’ homes and start again, helping to keep other dykes strong.

“I’m worried all the time. At night I’m trying to stay awake with a fire so I can burn a bit of grass and go check if the dyke is leaking or about to break. Every night. I’m so worried I can’t even sleep thinking that if I fall asleep the dyke could break and I can drown,” says Nyayang Kich, who had to abandon her flooded home for the higher ground of her neighbour.

The water sitting stagnant is compromising health too, leading to a spike in malaria-carrying mosquitoes.

“The climate has changed from the years when I was young because we have never experienced floods like this before. What we are experiencing now is horrible. We are suffering from hunger and we didn’t before. The climate has changed. For old people it’s horrible. It’s hard moving in this water; we don’t know where to sleep or what to eat. We are in God’s hands,” says 83-year-old Mary Nyamat.","Fri, 19 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98594f91e045de1aa58e97ae674b51bf2afed6fa/0_650_8272_4963/master/8272.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=11e7d9fdab4148e3e033de26dd5f581e,"['south', 'hunger', 'villages', 'food', 'work', 'night', 'land', 'drowned', 'old', 'sudans', 'flooded', 'floods', 'sudan', 'water', 'fangak', 'stalks']",

In December 2019, five people were killed by floods in Kampala after a downpour.

The dead included a police officer, an army officer and three others.

Earlier on May 26, 2019, eight other people died in a similar manner.

The floods hit many parts of the capital, cut off roads and destroyed several property in Kampala and surrounding areas of Bwaise, Nateete, Nalukolongo, Bugolobi, Nakawa ,Industrial Area, and Kyambogo. About 500 households were affected.

Following these incidents, Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) carried out a risk assessment and identified the most dangerous or risky roads that are vulnerable to floods during rainy season.

Based on the findings of the assessment, on March 24, 2021, KCCA issued a warning to Kampala residents about the flood hotspots and warned road users and residents.

This comes shortly after the Uganda weather authorities forecast that the country will be seeing more heavy rain characterised by flooding, strong winds, and lightning.

“Due to the current heavy rain, the public is warned that there will be a number of inconveniences from flooding i.e. submerging some of our roads and collapse of our aged infrastructure. Further, our transport infrastructure will be directly or indirectly damaged during these weather conditions posing a threat to human safety and causing significant disruption,” a KCCA public notice states.

“This arises from an inefficient storm water drainage system that is intended to manage overland flow. Government is organising funding to implement the Kampala Drainage Master Plan, which is intended to solve this problem,” the notice added.

Damaged roads

Many city roads are in poor state with potholes and a big number have been washed away.

Last week, a drainage channel at Mukwano Road roundabout that was completed last month caved in. The public accused Uganda National Roads Authority, KCCA officials, and contractors of connivance to do shoddy work on the channel.

One Twitter user, Mr Keith Ahumuza, posted that such shoddy works points to the issue of bad governance that Uganda is grappling with.

“The events playing out in our country currently from debts, injustices, corruption scandals, substandard works, and judicial issues are fruits of the kind of system that has been sown. Africa’s problem is not its people but the governance systems. God has His way of embarrassing,” he tweeted.

Ms Sharon Keitesi, another Twitter user, drew parallels with Tanzania, noting that if such had happened there, heads would have rolled at KCCA.

“If this had happened in Tanzania under the late Magufuli leadership, all the KCCA engineering team would be in jail but since this is Uganda, that’s normal and it cannot make any of the concerned authorities panic,” she tweeted.

On their part, the city authorities said: “There were defects on the recently completed works by one of our contractors on a Nakivubo Channel section at Mukwano Roundabout on Sixth Street, Industrial Area. The contractor, who undertook the failed works, shall be required to remedy according to the contract.”

“We appeal to the public to take precautions while using public infrastructure during the rainy season as government puts in place mechanisms to improve it,” a KCCA statement read.

Hopeful

Kampala drainage master plan

The city authorities completed the new Kampala Drainage Master Plan in December 2017.

According to a report to Parliament, the master plan provides structural measures to improve the city drainage and non-structural measures such as improving solid waste management and promoting use of green/pervious compounds to absorb floods.

KCCA officials say the implementation will cost $208m (about Shs758.6 billion). It is not clear if the funding for the master plan has been secured.

Last month was the warmest November in history. This followed the hottest January, May and September. All-time temperature peaks were registered from the Antarctic to the Arctic. Since the start of the year, Australia, Siberia and California have suffered record fires. The Atlantic has generated record storms. Ice in the Laptev Sea has started forming later than ever.

The coronavirus pandemic may have dominated the news and temporarily reduced emissions. But 2020 has also demonstrated the increasingly evident impact of human-driven global heating. The six hottest years in human history have all occurred since 2014. That sequence will certainly continue for a seventh year. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) will soon know whether 2020 will take first, second or third place in the all-time ranking.

Scientists are surprised temperatures have been so high in the absence of an El Niño, the phenomenon that boosts warmer years such as the current record, 2016. On the contrary, the latter half of this year there was the emergence of a cooling La Niña, which churned up chillier-than-normal waters in the equatorial Pacific. Petteri Taalas, the secretary-general of the WMO, said that without this influence, 2020 would certainly have been the warmest year ever measured.

In climate terms, the long-term trend is more important than individual records, but it is the latter that directly affects lives and livelihoods. Unusual heat, drought, fires or storms can be caused by natural variation, local factors or industrial emissions, but scientists are increasingly able to identify that extreme weather events are more frequent and intense as greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere.

“2020 has been another very hot year. We see very strongly the impact of what that means on the changing intensity and likelihood of extreme weather events,” said Friederike Otto, the associate director of the Environmental Change Institute at University of Oxford and co-lead of the World Weather Attribution initiative (WWA). “Every year of more emissions and increasing global mean temperature has an impact on people.”

Humankind’s fingerprint was particularly evident in the Siberian heatwave, which was made at least 600 times more probable by humans, and the Australian bushfires, which were made more than 30% more likely.

Here is how this year unfolded with global heating at 1.1C above pre-industrial levels. This toll may seem horrifying, but it is just a sample – and will be modest compared with a future world on course for more than 3C of warming.

JANUARY

1 January

Record floods in Indonesia kill at least 19 people, with 62,000 evacuated. The national meteorological agency reports the highest daily rainfall seen in Jakarta since records began in 1866: “This is not ordinary rain.”

4 January

Temperatures in the Sydney basin hit a new high of 48.9C, the latest in a series of records in Australia. Bushfires create a 620 miles (1,000km) wide, 21 miles high smoke cloud, three times bigger than anything seen in the world before. It spreads so far that black charcoal reaches Antarctica. Scientists describe it as “a new benchmark on the magnitude of stratospheric perturbations”.

FEBRUARY

6 February

Record mainland Antarctic heat. The Argentinian research base Esperanza on the northern tip of the Antarctic peninsula, measures a new high for the southern continent of 18.4C (65.3F).

9 February

Record Antarctic island heat. The 20.75C logged by Brazilian scientists at Seymour Island is almost a full degree higher than the previous record of 19.8C in 1982. This has still to be confirmed by the WMO.

MARCH

Second-hottest March on record

31 March

The Australian bushfire season comes to an end after more than six months of destruction – 33 fatalities, 3,000 homes burned, and more than 10m hectares (25m acres) razed. Wildlife deaths are estimated at more than 1bn mammals, birds and reptiles combined, and hundreds of billions of insects. From the beginning of September 2019 to 23 February 2020, bushfires have emitted 434m tonnes of carbon dioxide, equivalent to about three-quarters of the discharges of Australian industry. Studies by the WWA indicate the bushfires were made at least 30% more probable by human-driven climate change. The summer of 2019-2020 is the second-hottest ever, after the previous year’s summer.

APRIL

11 May

Devastating floods in Kenya and Uganda after heavy rain lead to 200 deaths, and the displacement of at least 400,000 people.

20 May

Super-cyclone Amphan is the fiercest storm to hit the Bay of Bengal this century, with winds of 118mph (190kmh). Two million people are evacuated, 129 killed. It is the costliest tropical cyclone on record, with losses in India of $14bn (£10bn).

20 June

Record Arctic heat. The Russian town of Verkhoyansk registers 38C (more than 100F) amid a freakishly prolonged Siberian heatwave. Siberian wildfires cover almost 1m hectares and release 59m tonnes of carbon dioxide, surpassing last year’s record. On average, temperatures in this region of the Arctic have been 5C above average in the first six months of the year. Scientists from the WWA say this was made at least 600 times more probable by human emissions.

13 August

Two months of record rainfall in southern China kills 219 people, prompts the evacuation of 4 million, and causes $26bn in economic losses. The Three Gorges Dam inflow hits a record 72,000 cubic meters a second. The megacity of Chongqing is put on its highest flooding alert since 1981.

16 August

Hottest summer ever in the northern hemisphere. Death Valley records a temperature of 54.4C (129.9F), the third-highest on Earth since 1931 (and the two previous records are in question).

26 August

Record fires in California. More than 405,000 hectares burn in nine days – more than three times the average in the “normal” wildfire season. At least five people are killed, and more than 100,000 evacuated.

28 August

Record rain in Karachi of 231mm (9 in) in a single day. Pakistan has the wettest month in its history.

SEPTEMBER

World’s hottest September on record

4-12 September

Record flooding in the Sahel region of Africa affects 500,000 people. The White and Blue Nile burst banks. The average level of the Blue Nile reaches 17.43 metres (57.19ft), the highest since Sudan started measuring in 1912. Senegal records 124mm of rain over a seven-hour downpour – the amount that would usually be expected across the entire rainy season from July to September. Sudan imposes a three-month state of emergency on 4 September, after rains destroys about 100,000 houses and kills more than 100 people. In Nigeria, flooding damages 500,000 hectares of farm produce, amounting to about 5bn naira (£9.8m), according to NKC African Economics.

12 September

Record fires, blazing since August, consume 28% of the Pantanal, the world’s largest tropical wetlands, spanning Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay. Fires also consume 2.2m hectares of the Amazon.

2 November

Philippines hit by Typhoon Goni, one of the strongest storms in history with gusts of up to 192 mph. At least 20 people are killed and almost a million evacuated.

17 November

Iota, the strongest hurricane on record to strike Nicaragua, triggers catastrophic flooding and landslides. At least 40 people die across Central America and Colombia. It follows Hurricane Eta – the first time on record the Atlantic has had two major hurricanes in November.

22 November

Somalia is devastated by Cyclone Gati, the strongest storm to hit this part of world since records in this region began five years ago. Rainfall in two days equals the two-year average. At least eight dead.

DECEMBER

1 December

Record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season ends. Thirty storms grew strong enough to earn a name, beating 2005’s record of 28 storms. The WMO ran out of storm names by September, turning to the Greek alphabet for labels for the first time since 2005.

4 December

The bushfire season starts early in Australia with devastating wildfires on Fraser Island as experts worry that the months ahead could be disastrous.

12 December

The World Meteorological Agency says 2020 is certain to be among the three hottest years ever recorded. Although global emissions are likely to have fallen by 7% this year, carbon concentrations in the atmosphere continue to rise. The UN reports global heating in on course to reach 3.2C by the end of the century because governments are not taking sufficient climate action to keep temperatures to the Paris Agreement target of 1.5C to 2C. All eyes are now on the UN climate conference (Cop26) in Glasgow next year.

30 December

Almost one year on from the first reported case of Covid-19 in Wuhan, China, the worldwide death toll of the pandemic has passed 1.6 million people and is estimated to cause $28tn of losses. Scientists have warned such outbreaks will become more common as the world’s natural life support systems, including the climate, break down as a result of rising temperatures, deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade. The UN secretary general says humanity has been waging war on nature, and that making peace will be the defining task of the 21st century.","Wed, 30 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fb9db4f80d4a4b71ebd3db63097319d092c6f50/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=014552998e4de138981ddd3ae07f737e,"['searing', 'records', 'record', 'hectares', '2020', 'photograph', 'fires', 'million', 'storms', 'average', 'floods', 'extreme', 'world', 'hottest', 'heat', 'weather']",

KAMPALA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- At least two children were killed by floods following heavy rains in the western Ugandan district of Rubanda on Saturday, police said here Sunday.

Elly Maate, the Kigezi regional police spokesperson in a statement, said two female juveniles were swept away by running water at Karengyere village, Muko Sub County, amid a heavy down pour.

""Police in Muko received information that two female juveniles were yesterday (Saturday) swept by running water amid heavy down pour. Bodies were retrieved pending postmortem,"" said Maate.

Several parts of the east African country, especially western and eastern regions, are currently experiencing normal to above normal rainfall, with destructive effects, according to the weather department.

In its March-May seasonal rainfall outlook, the Uganda National Meteorological Authority warned of enhanced rainfall over several parts of the country that could result into disasters such as landslides and foods, leading to loss of lives and destruction of property in the first major rain season.

Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) has significantly dealt with the challenge of flooding in the City.

A year ago, Kampala was experiencing floods at certain black spots that made navigation at those points impossible to go past for several hours after a downpour.

These locations included; Clock Tower on Entebbe Road that often covered the Fire Brigade headquarters parking; Mulwana Road in Bugoloobi Parish; at the Electoral Commission head office on Jinja Road; and the Bwaise communities in Kawempe Division. The floods disrupted navigation in the city, damaged both business and household property as well as affecting livelihoods in vulnerable communities.

KCCA embarked on an aggressive drainage infrastructure development programme in line with the Kampala Drainage Master Plan (KDMP) and the Kampala Capital City Strategic Plan 2020/2021-2024/2025 whose strategic goal is that “by June 2025 Kampala will be an inclusive, liveable, resilient and well planned city that provides economic opportunities to all”. The strategic plan is anchored on four pillars; Economic growth, governance and citizen engagement, quality of life and city resilience.

Some of the projects done or in progress include the construction of the Lubigi and Nakamiro channels with a combined stretch of 5.88Km at Shs82.7B launched in August 2020 by President Museveni. The two channels will solve the flood water menace in the low lying areas of Bwaise, stretching into Kawala in Rubaga Division.

The Clock Tower area and Mulwana Road flooding has been significantly dealt with by downstream interventions on Nakivubo Channel in the Kanyogoga swamp catchment area in Makindye and Nakawa divisions.

Here KCCA is desilting and widening the channel by removing gravel and other sediments that affect the breadth, depth and flow of water. The box culvert constructed on Mulwana Road plus widening and constructing the open drain that feeds into Nakivubo channel is already proving that the area shall be floodless when works are completed. The drainage works under the Kampala Flyover Project are to further solve the stagnation challenge at Clock Tower.

Other drainage improvement works including construction of St Dennis Channel that flows through Kulekana and Nakinyuguzi Channel in Salaama Parish, both in Makindye Division. In Central Division, KCCA is working on Kitamanya’agamba drain (below the Law Development Centre) in Kagugube Parish. In Rubaga Division, Nabulagala Channel and the box culvert along Sentema Road have been constructed, hence mitigating the flooding incidences.

Also in Rubaga Division, interim interventions on sections of Nalukolongo Primary Channel are ahead of the planned reconstruction once funds are obtained for both the channel works and remaining compensation of persons.

One of the key challenges affecting the efficiency of drainage channels is garbage. There is a lot of irresponsible dumping of garbage (polythene, plastic bottles and trade refuse) that ends up blocking the drainage system once it is swept away by surface water run-off or when dumped in the channels causing surface runoff build up and stagnation (floods). Whereas KCCA has emergency teams at the drainage channels during the rain, we appeal to the public to responsibly manage waste.

Another challenge is the illegal developments and encroachments on drainage reserves of primary and secondary channels. Some developers have constructed over the drains while others have illegally diverted the course of drainage channels. Consequently, the capacity of these drains has decreased and maintenance affected resulting in flooding as seen in Bugolobi, Nalukolongo Kamwokya, and Kansanga areas.

The KDMP was developed to improve the old, dilapidated and inefficient existing drainage systems. It recommends both structural and non-structural measures.

Sorting out Kampala’s drainage challenges may not be a fortnight or season’s work but great strides have been taken for one to confidently note that the floods are no more in Kampala, save for the temporal stagnation that usually clears within 10 to 15 minutes after a heavy downpour.

Traffic and business came to a standstill on Wednesday following a heavy downpour in Kampala.



The most affected roads were John Babiiha road where road construction works are on-going and Kyaggwe Road near Swaminarayan Temple. People with businesses along Kyaggwe road were forced to close after water entered their shops.



Business at Ham Shopping Grounds also came to a standstill as Nakivubo Channel overflowed and left the shops submerged in water.



The floods flowing from Clock Tower to Nakivubo Channel submerged the road making it nearly impassable for pedestrians and small cars. Some people were forced to remove their shoes, fold their trousers and wade through the floodwaters.



Some men were seen charging 1,000 shillings to carry pedestrians who didn't want to wade through the water, on their backs.



This isn't the first time Clock Tower is flooding. Various attempts have been made in vain to improve the drainage and ease the water flow.



Brian Bagala, an Engineer in charge of drainage at Kampala Capital City Authority-KCCA says the Clock Tower is bound to flood especially now that the area is excavated as works continue under the Kampala Fly Over project. He says as works proceed, some of the drainages in the area has been affected.



He, however, says the status will improve when the Flyover Project is concluded and the drainage in the area is worked upon.

The Nakibubo Channel is the converging area for storm-water in the Central Business area. Over 500 manholes are placed in the City leading storm-water into Nakivubo Channel. However, the channel is overwhelmed due to the grounding erection of buildings that have taken up the green spaces that could accommodate water.



In 2019, with funding from World Bank under the Kampala Institutional Infrastructure Development Project, KCCA contracted a consultant company, Nippon Engineering to study the channel and conduct an assessment, modelling and redesigning of the catchment area.



The consultant was supposed to conclude works by this month but Bagala says their activities were interrupted by COVID -19 Lockdown and were hence granted more time until December 2020.

70,70,FL-2019-000163-UGA,Heavy rains may mar quality of Ugandan coffee crop: official - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-coffee-idUSKBN2330PZ,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - The quality of Uganda’s coffee crop may decline in the coming months as heavy rains across the east African nation have reduced the amount of sunshine necessary for bean drying, an industry official told Reuters on Wednesday.

Uganda is Africa’s largest exporter of coffee followed by Ethiopia and grows mostly robusta variety.

The country has been pounded by unusually heavy rains that started in August resulting in deaths, displacement and extensive damage to roads and other infrastructure.

Western Uganda, including the foothills of the Rwenzori mountains that are among the biggest coffee growing areas, has received some of the most intense rains.

“The drying process is a major problem in most of the places...the weather is not good for drying,” David Muwonge, head of marketing at the National Union of Coffee Agribusiness and Farmer Enterprises (NUCAFE) told Reuters.

“There’s a higher risk of beans becoming mouldy unless farmers are well sensitised.”

Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA), the state-run regulator, forecasts Uganda’s bean exports will climb 16% to 5.1 million 60-kg (132-pound) bags in the current crop year ending September.

The country’s coffee output has surged in recent years, the fruition of a government programme that has been distributing free seedlings to farmers to expand acreage and replace aging trees.

Authorities say their target is to help boost annual production to 20 million bags by 2025.

The beans have traditionally been Uganda’s biggest commodity export but were recently overtaken by gold which now annually earns the country over $1 billion.

Muwonge said the damage to transport infrastructure by the rains and flooding was likely slow the flow of beans from farms and collection centres from some of the deep rural areas.","Tue, 26 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['drying', 'farmers', 'official', 'crop', 'quality', 'beans', 'million', 'coffee', 'damage', 'ugandan', 'rains', 'mar', 'ugandas', 'heavy', 'told']",

More than 1,000 families displaced by floods that ravaged Karusandara Sub County, Kasese district close to three months ago, are struggling to survive.



The families were displaced after the floods hit villages of Kivengenyi, Kabaka, Kanamba and Kyalanga in Karusandara Sub County following a heavy downpour that burst the banks of River Mubuku and Nyamwamba.



With no access to necessities, the families can hardly afford a meal a day. They accuse both government and the local leadership for deliberately refusing to address their plight.



The victims who include pregnant women, youth, children and the elderly are camped in nine IDPs spread across the sub-county.



Erias Forda, a resident of Kivengenyi village says that he lacks food to feed his family after all his garden was washed away by the floods. Forda who has camped Karusandara seed secondary school with his eight children says that they last received relief food in June.



“All our plantations were washed away, even the remaining is drying up, so we have not food or a place to return to,” Forda says

Above-average 2020 second season cereal harvest expected in bi‑modal rainfall areas

Delayed and reduced 2020 harvest gathered in Karamoja Region

Abundant seasonal rains benefiting pastoral livelihoods

Prices of maize at low levels due to adequate availabilities and depressed demand

Food security situation still affected by measures to contain spread of COVID‑19 pandemic, despite phasing out of some restrictions

Above-average 2020 second season cereal harvest expected in bi‑modal rainfall areas

In bi‑modal rainfall areas covering most of the country, harvesting of the 2020 second season crops is about to start and will be completed in January. The September‑November rainy season was characterized by abundant precipitations, especially in northern areas, favouring crop establishment and development. Vegetation conditions are good across the country (see ASI map) and an above-average crop production is expected. However, the torrential rains triggered flooding in September and October near Lake Albert and Lake Kyoga, in northwestern Amuru, Adjumani, Obongi, Packwach, Moyo, Lamwo and Arua districts and in eastern Butaleja and Mbale districts. In addition, landslides occurred in mountain areas of eastern Mbale, southern Kisoro and western Bunyangabo districts. Floods and landslides affected about 16 500 people and caused losses of lives, damage to infrastructure and localized crop losses. Subsequently, in late November, heavy rains caused floods in Mbarara District and landslides in Kasese District, both located in the South-Western Region, affecting more than 2 000 people.

The first season harvest concluded in July and production was estimated at above‑average levels due to abundant seasonal rains, despite localized but significant flood-related production shortfalls.

Total cereal production for 2020 is put at about 3.6 million tonnes, nearly 4 percent up from 2019 and similar to the average of the previous five years.

In February 2020, a desert locust outbreak affected northeastern Teso and Karamoja subregions and northern Acholi and Lango subregions. Damage to pastures and crops was localized as swarms were of relatively small size and the Government, with the support of FAO, carried out effective control operations. Although as of late November no swarms were present in the country, Cyclone Gati hit northern Somalia on 22 November 2020 bringing heavy rains and creating a conducive environment for the formation of several immature swarms in early December. Some of these swarms could reach northern Kenya by mid‑December. As a result, there is a concrete risk of another locust invasion of northeastern and northern areas of the country, characterized by an already fragile food security situation. The desert locust response plan is 90 percent funded through multiple donors and agencies, and contingency plans are in place for surveillance and control measures.

Delayed and reduced harvest gathered in Karamoja Region

In the uni‑modal rainfall agro‑pastoral Karamoja Region, the April‑September rainy season had an early onset in March, with heavy rains triggering flooding and waterlogging which resulted in delayed and reduced plantings, also due to seed shortages. As a result, although the good performance of seasonal rains benefitted yields, cereals and pulses were harvested in October, with about a one‑month delay, and production is estimated at 10‑20 percent below average due to a reduced planted area and to the continuation of seasonal rains into October, which resulted in increased post-harvest losses.

Abundant seasonal rains benefitting pastoral livelihoods

In the agro‑pastoral areas of Cattle Corridor and Karamoja Region, abundant rains between September and November have resulted in above‑average rangeland conditions (see Vegetation Condition Index Map). Ample availability of water and pasture benefitted animal body conditions, with above‑average levels of meat and milk production. However, in Cattle Corridor significant losses of pasture due to floods have been reported in western Ntoroko and Bullisa districts and in central Nakasongola District. In Karamoja Region, the restrictive measures introduced to curb the spread of the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and the COVID‑19 pandemic, coupled with persisting insecurity related to cattle raids, have disrupted livestock movements and, animal and milk sales.

Prices of maize at low levels due to adequate availabilities and depressed demand

Prices of maize decreased by about 50 percent between May and August in all monitored markets, including the capital, Kampala, as the commercialization of the first season harvest increased market availabilities. The COVID‑19‑related restrictions exerted further downward pressure on prices, as demand by restaurants, hotels, schools and urban households was constrained by a lower economic activity and declines in incomes. Prices increased by about 15‑20 percent in September, as seasonal patterns were compounded by flood‑related trade disruptions, remaining subsequently mostly stable in October and November. Prices of maize in November were almost 40 percent below their year‑earlier levels.

In the cereal deficit Karamoja Region, the availability of low priced cereals from neighbouring surplus producing areas in Soroti, Lira and Acholi regions has resulted in a generalized decline of cereal prices, despite the below‑average local harvest. In several markets of the region, including Moroto, Kaabong and Napak, prices of sorghum in September were up to 20 percent below their year‑earlier levels.

Food security situation affected by measures adopted to contain spread of COVID‑19 pandemic

The restrictive measures introduced in March and April 2020 by the Government to curb the spread of the COVID‑19 pandemic had a substantial adverse impact on the food security situation. Despite the easing of restrictions in June/July, the economic and livelihood recovery has been slow.

According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, conducted in Karamoja Region, refugee settlements, host communities and urban areas, 2 million people (17 percent of the analyzed population) are estimated to be severely food insecure (IPC Phase 3: “Crisis” and Phase 4: “Emergency”) in the period September 2020-January 2021.

KEY MESSAGES

After an early onset, the March to May rainfall season peaked in late April and early May. Torrential rain caused floods in the Lake Victoria basin, major river basins, and low-lying flood-prone areas. At least 845,000 people were displaced across the Horn, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, according to data available from OCHA and country governments.

The rainfall season began to subside by mid-May, marking an earlier-than-normal end to the season in some short rains- and Gudependent areas of the Horn and an atypical dry spell in parts of Uganda. Dry and hot conditions are expected in bimodal areas of the Horn until the onset of the short rains/Deyr rains in late September/October.

Rangeland conditions remain exceptionally favorable in most bimodal areas. However, crop production prospects in eastern and southeastern Kenya, southern and northwestern Somalia, southwestern Ethiopia, parts of Uganda, and southeastern South Sudan are being closely monitored due to the mixed effects of heavy rainfall and floods, early end of season, and desert locusts.","Sat, 13 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1522366-EAST_AFRICA_Seasonal_Monitor_2020_06_07_final.png?itok=o2uM5OJJ,"['africa', 'seasonal', 'season', 'rainfall', '2020', 'areas', 'parts', 'east', 'horn', 'early', 'short', 'monitor', 'southeastern', 'rains', 'world', 'uganda', '12']",

SPRINGFIELD - Water continues to rise in some parts of Livingston Parish as Tropical Depression Beta brews in the Gulf.

The storm surge produced wind speeds up 30 mph, causing flooding along the immediate coasts of the Gulf, Lake Maurepas and Lake Pontchartrain. Livingston Parish officials say the water has risen a few feet in just 24 hours.

Along the Tickfaw River, you can find high water signs, roadways submerged in water, and businesses that were forced to close because of the flooding.

Cameron Ferachi, a resident in the Terry Harbor neighborhood, says it floods every time a storm comes their way.

""I need a boat to get to and from my truck,"" Ferachi said.

Ferachi's camp sits at the end of a flooded road. To avoid pushing water into homes or damage to his vehicle, he and his best friend Mike have come up with a solution. They kayak to and from their trucks, which are parked at the end of the street.

Paddling up and down the roads they usually travel down in a vehicle is not a situation they're excited to be in.

""When the water comes up, you get people out here sightseeing, pushing water in front of everybody. It really sucks,"" Ferachi said.

These conditions are so inconvenient for some locals, like Ferachi, that they plan to move away.

""I'm actually moving Oct. 13 to get away from the flooding. I can't deal with it anymore,"" Ferachi said from his kayak.

In the meantime, flash flood warnings and advisories remain active in the area through Wednesday, Sept. 23.

Livingston Parish officials say they will continue to monitor the area. If you are in need of sand or sandbags, supplies are available at your local fire department.

As we conclude the celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, lets remind ourselves about cities across the globe that have been designed to embrace livable and sustainable human settlement while putting a comparison with Uganda’s capital that poses as a flopped state seeking emergence renaissance. A ‘1.7 million people City’ seated on 189 square kilometers gives an average density of 8994 persons per square kilometer approximately (UBOS data 2019), with numerous hills and beautiful sceneries that have attracted the largest number of Ugandan elites.

The uncontrolled organic urban development taking pace on the look of urban authorities that has rendered ex-green belts, swamps and public harbours susceptible to a risk of being eaten up by human activities. The increasing land value in the city centre is sending away the urban poor and directing them to settling in wetlands and other protected areas due to lack of alternatives.

Kampala has for a longtime proved to be a city with imbalances between population growth and settlement patterns. It is a place of sarcastic and adverse urban development, city-wide decay and low rate of response to emergencies. Pavements and rooftops mean that less rainwater can soak into the ground. The pattern of streets and buildings has interrupted some of the natural drainage ways and reduced the width of some channels. As a result, more water runs off more quickly, and the drainage system has often become overloaded.

The city is majorly challenged with lack of hydraulic and hydrological-related data where it has failed to manage a clear record of its rainfall amounts, wetland distribution, drainage systems and general water flows data, uncontrolled urban expansion, abandoned buildings, illegal connections of sewage into the separate drainage network, and great amounts of sediments and organic matter which decrease the performance of the drainage facilities, lack of legal instruments and difficulty to approve new legislation, urban planning restrictions, institutional and political problems, opposition by the population, designers and public managers.

Additionally, it’s identified with overlooked scramble and partitioning of land within the wetlands hence bleeding with limited space for catchment of storm water. Land managers spearhead wetland destruction through personalisation and issuing of land titles in these vulnerable places.

The notion, “water is life” is gradually decelerating in the city centre since a dream of a heavy rain is a nightmare to many. The manner in which wetland resources have been depleted is a disgrace to the face of urban planning as a profession and provokes ridiculers into questioning the prevailing urban management systems. The massive erosion, silting of drainage channels, poor waste management as well as reclamation all contribute to this ‘city of floods.’

Natives interpret the status quo as a normal phenomenon that seasonally comes and goes, forgetting the long-term consequences that are left behind. People seem not to be bothered because after a flood wash, business resumes ordinarily.

The urban authority in-charge of the city alleges that it formulated a drainage master plan to curb the flood and its effects which has been challenged with limited funding and skilled workmanship. The drainage master plan that was formulated in 2003 was a way of directing storm water that increased steadily due to the reduction in the green spaces that have been pressurised by the ever-increasing population.

Until now its workability is questioned. This has overtime hyped the concern of many government bodies including the National Physical Planning Board that has responded by cautioning the city managers to take concern of the known flooding, housing and planning challenges to ensure improved livelihoods for the citizens. The challenges of excess storm water management in Kampala can be wrapped under one theme “lack of an operational and easily implementable urban and environmental master plan”.

In 2016, an Italian based consultancy firm specialised in water and land scape designing called “SGI Studio Galli Ingegneria” was contracted to review the 2003 Kampala Drainage Master Plan to check its operationability, its challenges and to pledge a way forward, a project that lasted for five months.

As a result, different additions were observed and taken onboard. It has also been noted with great concern that drainage has been given priority under KIIDP 2, a project that supports Kampala City improvement through world bank funding. However, it is ironical to say that with all such consideration, the drainage system has continued to smack as the biggest challenge that the ‘country’s capital’ battles with especially during a heavy rain.

The central government’s silence over the castrophe makes one to think that there is a ‘burning solution’ that is being planned indoors that is yet to be unveiled, only to hear tales. Kampala metropolitan is a home of numerous wetlands including Bwaise, Ndeeba, Katwe, Nakivubo, Namasuba among others but soon will be living in a shadow of its glamorous natural resources as more swamps continue to be reclaimed.

The city of floods is this town that has been built on wetlands without safeguards to stormwater/flooding and yet city buildings and infrastructure seat on former water catchment arenas. Therefore, city wide developments should be established in a manner that advocates for the wellbeing of natural resources, drainage channels should be reconstructed, waste should be properly disposed at household level, buildings close to drainage channels should have paved compounds as ways of controlling blockages in stormwater flow.

Management of a flood wash should be handled by respective risk management committees at local council level, maintain records of the people/areas affected and have constant checkups and monitoring tours within these sections but most importantly to utilize the use of a GIS system to predict future hazards.

Finally, the city authority must perceive the fact that people settling in these low-lying areas are to stay with the flood until our contemporary political and budgetary system support proper urban planning.

Enforcement of non-structural planning laws is particularly challenging due to the physically extensive informal housing in wetlands which is exacerbated by political, policy, and socioeconomic arrangements.

“There may not be enough time to prepare after you are notified of a flood watch…” (Boulder, 2002). Therefore, urban managers should also empower communities to maintain their drainage systems, through regular inspection and cleaning of drains, an important task that can be performed without specialized skills.

Mr Rahim Lubadde is a physical planner.

The most affected landing sites in Hoima are Tonya, Kijangi, Kaiso, Rwentali, Hoimo, Fofo, Mbegu, Waaki and Kiryamboga among others, while the affected areas in Kikuube include Nkondo, Sebigoro, Ususa, Senjojo, Wangjok, Busiki and Nsonga.



The flood victims have sought refuge in churches and schools while others are sleeping out in coldness under trees as the floods continue to ravage the area. Area leaders and the affected persons say the only option is to resettle them to the game reserve.



Peter Kyasimire a resident of Nkondo landing site in Kabwoya Sub County in Kikuube district says the government should consider the lives of the people and have them resettled.

Joyce Akumu who was displaced by floods at Kaiso landing site says currently she is settling at Kaiso Primary School with her five children since she has nowhere to construct another house because her house was completely submerged by floods.



Rashid Sunday, a resident of Sebigoro landing site says he was hit hard by the floods that submerged his house and currently he has nowhere to go.



He wants the government to come to their rescue and allocate part of the Kabwoya-Kaiso-Tonya community wildlife conservation area to resettle them.

The Kabwoya Wildlife Reserve and the Kaiso-Tonya Community Wildlife Area were established following the revision of the protected area estate in Uganda in the late 1990s.



A decree of parliament in 2002 created the two protected areas from the former Kaiso Tonya Controlled Hunting area which had been gazetted in 1963.

The recent rains remind me of how poor our drainage system is. All you have to do is look at the roads every time it rains to know there is something fundamentally wrong with our infrastructure. And the most ridiculous thing about all this is that it has been happening since time immemorial. It is as if we are supposed to learn to live with the floods and normalise them. I have never travelled to other countries so I don’t know whether it is the same case elsewhere.

Do rain floods paralyse movement from one place to another in other countries too or is it just us? Do people have to be carried from one side of the road to another, do cars “drown” in mini rivers? And for those countries that have managed to solve this problem, how did they do it? Can we learn from them? What role can we all play in trying to create a clean and flood-free country?

I know for sure that if we followed a well-organised garbage dumping system, we would not have to deal with the consequences of a clogged drainage system. I also know that if we stopped settling in water catchment areas, we wouldn’t mess up the eco-system and the water would follow a natural drainage flow. What I don’t know is why we don’t do these things and yet continue to cry foul.

Every so often we wake up to huge factories built in what we all know to be swampy areas and yet we say nothing.

I wonder who we think will speak up for us. We have abused our environment way too much to expect any favours from nature.

There’s a song by the Swedish pop group, Ace of Bace titled, Everytime it rains. The chorus of that song says, “Cause every time it rains, I fall to pieces. So many memories the rain releases, I feel you, I taste you. I cannot forget. Every time it rains, I get wet”.

Well, here is a Ugandan rendition of those lines. “Every time it rains, Uganda falls to pieces. So much sewage and dirt and all manner of garbage the rain releases. We smell it, we are even doused in it, every time it rains.

Seriously though, we must do something about our drainage system and put an end to this man-made mess.

Despite rain reducing in most parts of the country, many others continue to experience devastating effects of floods.

The raging floods have claimed about 20 lives and left thousands homeless. The worst hit are eastern, northern and western parts of the country.

In western region, Kasese District has experienced back-to-back floods after five major rivers burst their banks, sweeping away homes, schools, hospitals, and churches.

The recent episode was on May 21 when rivers Thaku and Lhubiriha burst their banks near the Uganda-DR Congo border, killing eight people.

The Kasese District environment officer, Mr Augustine Kooli, said the rainfall pattern in the area was the highest in April and May more than any other time of the year.

“The district experiences a bimodal rainfall pattern. The first rains are short but fall with high intensity and occur between March and May, and the longer rains from August to November have a low intensity,” he explained.

He added: “Annual rainfall ranges from 800mm to 1,600mm and is greatly influenced by altitude. At the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains, the rainfall amount is between 1,200mm and 1,400mm.” Mr Kooli explained that under the District Integrated Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan 2017-2020, they encouraged the communities to plant trees on mountain slopes to reduce the runoff.

Western region

In Isingiro District, five people died in Kabuyanda Town Council and Kabuyanda Sub-county on May 2 following heavy rain, according to Isingiro South MP Alex Byarugaba.

The rain also triggered landslides and floods in the hilly area characterised by deep valleys. “We have always experienced these catastrophes but this time the impact was far too great; I had never seen this extent of damage by rains,” Mr Byarugaba said on Monday.

The floods and landslides destroyed houses, banana plantations, vegetable gardens, fishponds, roads and bridges.

Mr Byarugaba added that more than 800 households of between 4,000 and 5,000 people were affected in Kikagati and Kabuyanda Town Council, while bridges in Kaburara, Rwabisheri, Kabumba, and Kamwotsya were destroyed. “These are crossing points within these sub-counties, connecting health centres, schools and markets. People now can’t easily access these places. Local leaders have mobilized people who just worked on temporary measures for crossing,” he remarks.

In Kanungu District, the area vice chairman, Mr Gad Byomuhangi, on Monday said most roads and bridges were destroyed by rain and yet they do not have money to work on them.

The Kisoro District chairperson, Mr Abel Bizimana, said Rubuguri-Katojo road was cut off after Rushaga Bridge was washed away by floods.

He added that Ruhezamyenda Bridge that connects Rubuguri-Kisoro Town road was also washed away and local people have resorted to using community paths to connect to either side.

In eastern Uganda, floods mostly hit Manafwa, Kween, Bududa, Sironko, Pallisa, Butaleja, and Bukedea districts.

In Pallisa, more than 30 families were displaced at the beginning of the month after floods swept away their homes and gardens.

In Kween District, landslides killed three people and displaced about 50 families in Chepsukunya Town Council and Ngenge Sub-county.

In Budaka District, hundreds are stranded with nowhere to sleep after a heavy storm hit several villages.

Northern region

In Lango Sub-region, more than 350 households in Apac District have been left homeless.

The affected are residents of Acholi Inn Landing Site, Kayei Landing Site, Wansolo Landing Site, and Kampala Kagoi, all in Akokoro Sub-county.

The flash floods also affected residents of Aganga, Tarogali and Alworoeng parishes in Ibuje Sub-county.

Overflowing water from Lake Kyoga and River Nile is currently invading dry land along the shorelines every day, submerging homes and gardens of crops.

The Apac Resident District Commissioner (RDC), Ms Beatrice Akello Akori, said a team from the district visited the affected areas last week to assess the damage and is compiling a report that will be sent to the Office of the Prime Minister. “We are looking at resettling them at Maruzi Ranch but these people are very tricky; once you give them land, they don’t want to leave it,” she said.

In Busoga Sub-region, increasing water levels on Lake Victoria have displaced about 4,000 residents at Masese Landing Site, Rippon and Gomba, all in Jinja Municipal Council.

The councillor representing Masese at Jinja Municipal Council, Mr Ronald Katongole, said there is a need to relocate all people at Masese Landing site. “We (local leaders) have tried to do what is necessary to ensure that people are safe but due to this pandemic, sometimes people turn violent that implementing some of the health directives is challenging,” he said.

Central region

In Masaka District, increasing water levels at landing sites on Lake Victoria shoreline have started extending to villages, sparking fear among residents.

By last week, the floods had swept through Makonzi Parish, Bukakata Sub-county, displacing 450 households across five villages of Kasaka, Bwami, Bukoko, Kisuku and Makonzi .

The floods first submerged the landing sites of Lambu, Kaziru, Kisuku, Malembo and Kachanga, forcing about 20,000 people to relocate to safer places on the mainland where they have since set up makeshift houses.

Although government has extended them some relief assistance such as food and tarpaulins, the victims are still in dire need of more humanitarian assistance.

Bukakkata Sub-county chairperson Aloysius Jjuko said no deaths have been recorded though residents are at high risk of contracting water -borne diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera and Hepatitis A due to the deteriorating sanitation situation in the area.

“Our focus has been on those displaced from landing sites but the problem has escalated, residents have lost houses and crops and government should assist them as well,” he said The Resident District Commissioner, Mr Herman Ssentongo, said area leaders have been tasked to identify free government land where victims can permanently be resettled. “This tragedy is unprecedented and as government we cannot leave our people to continue suffering; a lasting solution has to be found,” he said.

Kalangala cut off

In Kalangala, flash floods have also caused similar havoc, cutting off three landing sites and separating them from the main Bugala Island. The affected landing sites are Kaazi-Malanga, Mukalanga and Kasamba in Bujumba Sub-county.

Access to the three landing sites from Bugala Island has been by road but currently, residents have to use boats to connect to the area. Mr Federico Ssekatawa, the chairperson Kaazi- Malanga Village, said life on the ‘new island’ has become very difficult as residents lack food, clean water and medical supplies.

Currently, an estimated 7,500 residents in the area have no access to electricity supply after the devastating floods forced the service provider, Kalangala Infrastructure Services, to disconnect power lines to avoid electrocution.

• Torrential rains are being experienced across Uganda. According to the Uganda National Meteorological Department (UNMA), abovenormal rains will continue until the end of the year.

• At least 38 people have died due to floods and landslides in Bundibugyo, Bududa and Sironko districts, and over 150 people have been injured. At least 300,000 have been affected and an estimated 65,000 people are displaced, according to Government sources.

• The floods and landslides have left a trail of destruction, including damaged homes, infrastructure, agriculture and livelihoods.

• The Government of Uganda, with the support of humanitarian partners, is responding to the most urgent needs of people affected.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

Due to heavier than normal rains since September—enhanced by the positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)—several districts in Uganda have been experiencing flash floods (mostly in urban areas) and landslides (in rural/hilly areas).

According to preliminary estimates from a rapid assessment conducted by the Office of the Prime Minister in the most affected sub-regions of Mount Elgon and South Western Uganda in early December, at least 300,000 people have been affected, including 65,000 people reportedly displaced by the impact of heavy rains since September 2019. Over 21,500 hectares of crop and plantations are reportedly damaged in these areas. As of 17 December, 38 people have reportedly lost their lives, including in the mountainous Bundibugyo district in the western region and the Mount Elgon area in eastern Uganda. Water systems in Bundibugyo have been destroyed, exacerbating the risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases. In the week of 16 December, three suspected cholera cases were reported in Bundibugyo district. However, they tested negative and there have been no confirmed cholera cases since November 2019, according to the Ministry of Health and WHO.

In the eastern lowland sub-regions of Teso and Bukedea sub-regions, thousands of people have been affected and hectares of crops destroyed. Damage to infrastructure, including roads and bridges, has been reported in the hilly south-western parts of Kigezi and Ruwenzori, the low-lying district of Ntoroko, the central sub-region of Buganda, western sub-regions of Ankole and Bunyoro, and northern sub-regions of Acholi, and Karamoja regions. This has hampered access to affected communities. Districts along the banks of the River Nile in West Nile sub-region have also suffered losses of crops and destroyed and damaged homes due to flooding.","Thu, 19 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1429368-ROSEA_20191219_Uganda_Floods_FlashUpdate%231.png?itok=t_WNKUX8,"['landslides', 'reportedly', 'western', 'flash', 'subregions', '2019', 'update', 'affected', 'rains', 'floods', 'uganda', 'including', 'bundibugyo', '19']",

The East African Community (EAC) Council of Ministers suggests Uganda may have breached the agreements on how much water to release from Nalubaale dam — the main outlet of the world’s largest freshwater lake.

Lake Victoria flows into River Nile, with the dam being one of the two major outlets.

Documents filed at the EAC Council of Ministers say Uganda has refused to execute a new policy governing the release of water in Jinja, a decision that has led to flooding of the lake that could claim more lives and cause destruction.

The council ordered EAC member states to implement the policy in 2012, but over four years, despite protests by Uganda.

Kenya, Tanzania and Burundi voted for its implementation at a Council of Ministers meeting that year.

Uganda insists that the policy, which determines volumes of water to be released based on Lake Victoria levels, cannot be implemented as it does not take into consideration several factors, like extraction in the affected countries.

Life and death

The policy is yet to be implemented. “The 26th EAC Council of Ministers directive on the policy has taken more than four years to implement, not only by Uganda, but also by the partner state,” Uganda says in its appeal to the council.

“Studies that had been directed to be completed by November 2014 have never started. Uganda is, therefore, of the view that the policy cannot be implemented and needs review.”

Nalubaale dam was built as part of a hydropower station in Jinja after Uganda and Egypt signed agreements that the East African country would not do anything to interfere with the flow of the Nile, the world’s longest river.

However, power station operators have, over the years, increased or reduced the volumes of water flowing from the lake based on how much is needed to meet the East African country’s electricity demand.

The release of too much water means Lake Victoria’s depth will decrease, a situation blamed on drought for many years.

Releasing less water means the level of the lake increases and could lead to floods in towns and villages surrounding it.

Floods killed at least six people and displaced 32,000 in Kisumu County and its environs in April and May. Ugandan authorities want the original natural flow out of the lake maintained.

The regional bloc ordered implementation of the schedule after it emerged that Uganda had been violating agreements to maintain the natural Lake Victoria outflow volumes before Nalubaale dam was built.

Mitigation measures

Uganda says the studies that led to the policy failed to consider major water extractions in the three countries.

It adds that the EAC Council of Ministers ordered the implementation of the policy before more data and information on water extraction in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania had been collected, yet that was recommended by experts whose reports were used in formulating it.

“The developed and adopted blueprint is therefore only a release policy and not a release and abstraction one,” Uganda says in its appeal.

“Potential impacts of the policy in Lake Victoria Basin countries as well as downstream states was not carried out to provide mitigation measures for a win-win situation as directed by the Council of Ministers.”

“Uganda has more than 600 kilometres of River Nile across her territory that includes lakes Kyoga and Albert. It has made significant developments based on the agreed curve policy that came into existence in 1954, which will be affected by the new water release and abstraction policy.”

The construction of Nalubaale hydroelectric power station in 1954 provided a reliable source of electricity for Uganda, but the decision has come to haunt hundreds of thousands of families living around the lake.

Before the construction of Nalubaale, the Owen and Ripon waterfalls were the main links between Lake Victoria and the Nile.

The waterfalls also acted as a natural tap, controlling the Nile and Lake Victoria outflows. After signing the agreements with Egypt, Uganda built Owen Falls dam, later renamed Nalubaale.

Preparations for building the giant dam and power station meant that Ripon Falls was to be excavated.

Moderating factor

Eventually, Nalubaale was submerged but Ripon Falls remained.

But as Uganda celebrated its increased electricity supply capacity, it was the beginning of problems for millions of people around areas touched by the lake in the three countries.

Since the commissioning of Nalubaale in 1959, its operators have either increased or reduced Lake Victoria outflows, depending on volumes required for the production of electricity.

When more water is needed to meet growing power demands, operators allow more water to flow out of Victoria, which in turn leads to lower levels in the lake.

Whenever rain falls heavily, Nalubaale has sufficient water. It means less water is released, increasing levels in Lake Victoria in turn.

To increase power production and utilise excess water spills from Nalubaale, Uganda built another dam called Kiira just a kilometre away. President Yoweri Museveni commissioned it in 2003.

In 2005, World Bank senior disaster risk management specialist Daniel Kull led a study that showed that Uganda released more than 50 per cent of the allowed water volumes from Nalubaale and Kiira dams over the previous two years.

Fish population

Mr Kull’s team also found that the drastic fall in Lake Victoria water levels at the time was more as a result of the releases in Jinja than drought as had been widely believed.

“Based on the results of this analysis, it must be concluded that the severe Lake Victoria drops occurring in 2004 and 2005 were about 45 per cent due to drought and 55 per cent due to over-releases from Nalubaale and Kiira dams,” the World Bank disaster risk specialist’s report said.

It added that the rains that followed could not raise the levels of the lake, which was partial evidence that water release had more impact that drought.

Nalubaale dam is operated by Eskom Uganda Ltd — a subsidiary of South Africa’s state-owned Eskom Holdings Ltd.

Eskom has been spilling large volumes of water from Nalubaale and Kiira dams between February and May. The water reached its peak limits after the heavier-than-normal rainfall, leading to floods.

The effects of water releases go beyond flooding. When the water level in the lake drops, it affects the fish population.

As marine creatures move inwards to deeper waters, fishermen follow them. They at times get arrested after ending up in Uganda or Tanzania.

At least 70 Kenyan fishermen were arrested after crossing into Uganda between May and October last year.

They were released after paying heavy fines. Others had their boats confiscated. Some complained of being tortured and beaten by Ugandan security officials.","Fri, 22 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.monitor.co.ug/resource/blob/1891214/b3b31c7a34adabef0a3b28da04b1f481/latest07pix-data.jpg,"['lake', 'policy', 'releasing', 'dam', 'council', 'lvictoria', 'floods', 'uganda', 'water', 'release', 'volumes', 'ugandas', 'nalubaale', 'victoria', 'blamed']",

The continuous rising water level in Lake Kwania has forced thousands of people in Dokolo district from their homes. The water has submerged several homes and gardens over the past three months forcing residents to take shelter in schools, churches and community facilities.



More than 5000 households have been affected in different Sub Counties in Dokolo District. Agwata, Adok, Adeknino and Kwera sub counties are the most affected where the water levels seem to be increasing each day. At least 166 households have been displaced in Agwata Sub County.



The affected families have temporarily moved in with their relatives or friends while others are renting in areas that are not affected by the flooding. At least 20 households have taken shelter at Kachung Junior, a private Primary school.



However, their biggest challenge is lack of clean drinking water. The families are currently depending on the flood water for drinking and domestic chores since the only borehole at the school has been dysfunctional for the past five months. They are also forced to share classrooms and open dormitories.



John Obel, a resident of Kachung Western Ward, says the area is flooded to the point that all their feet is rotting. He says their need small canoes to navigate the area.

Musa Ecweru, minister of state for relief and disaster preparedness, told Xinhua by telephone that torrential rains which started last month, marking the first major rainfall season in the country, have displaced people, destroyed homes, farms, washed away roads and other infrastructure.

He said most of the affected areas include the mountainous and hilly areas in eastern and western Uganda, low lying and plain areas in eastern region.

“This problem is across the whole country. Now there are thousands of people who are displaced. The officers in my office are compiling the figures (numbers of people) and extent of damage for each district across Uganda,” said Ecweru.

“We are going to sit down and see how to handle the magnitude of the problem. We shall see how to dispatch some support to the affected persons,” he said.

The Office of the Prime Minister has been running alert messages, warning that the country will face floods, landslides, strong winds and lightning as the first rain season peaks.

“We have been running alert messages on televisions and radios. These alerts started running about five months ago. We have been telling and warning the country of heavy rains and its dangerous effects,” said Ecweru.

He said landslides have hit the hilly western district of Kabale.

Ecweru said people living in mountainous areas, flood prone areas as well as wetlands should immediately vacate to safe places as heavy rains continue.

At least two children were killed by floods following heavy rains in the western district of Rubanda on Saturday, according to police.

According to the weather department, several parts of the country especially western and eastern regions, are currently experiencing normal to above normal rainfall, with destructive effects.

More than 150 families in Dei A Village, Panyimur Sub-county in Pakwach District are homeless after their houses were submerged following the rising water levels of Lake Albert.

Mr Nicholas Opar, the village chairperson, said the floods destroyed several houses and washed away crops.

The most affected communities are mainly fishermen from Singla Market, Kayonga and Wangkado in Panyimur Sub-county.

Mr Opar said most of the affected families were temporarily hosted by their relatives while others have sought refuge in nearby government primary schools.

“We are living in fear and anticipate a possible cholera and typhoid outbreak among others that may affect the community who live near the Nile and have occasionally been using the lake as their water source for domestic purposes,” he said.

Mr Shaban Ofoy, the sub-county chairperson, said the situation could create a food crisis in the area.

“We anticipate hunger because huge acres of gardens with crops were washed away,” Mr Kinobe said. He said they had previously warned the communities against settling in the wetlands but they have been hesitant to adhere to the directives because they had no place to relocate to.

Mr Robert Omito, the district chairperson, appealed to government and well-wishers for relief.

“We have notified the [Ministry] of Relief, Disaster and Preparedness, and Uganda Red Cross regional office to assess the level of devastation and come to our rescue urgently and attend to the village,” Mr Omito said.

He added that said since most of the affected families mainly rely on fishing as source of their livelihood, there is urgent need of relief supplies such as food, tents and blankets to temporarily settle the affected families.

Recurrent

In December last year, floods cut off Pakwach-Karuma road, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded. The Uganda National Meteorology Authority, in its “seasonal rainfall outlook for March to May 2020,” warned that there would be an overall increased likelihood of near normal to above normal (wetter than average) rainfall in several parts of the country. Floods have also ravaged other districts, including Kasese, Ntoroko, Bundibugyo, Kabale, Ntungamo and Isingiro.

The residents who live along the shores of Lake Kwania have remained homeless and their gardens of crops submerged after the Lake burst its banks last month.



Jimmy Emmanuel Okello Ecun, the Nambieso Sub County Male Councillor expressed fear that the affected communities will suffer severe famine since they mainly depend on subsistence farming.



He argued that it is the responsibility of the government to protect its citizen and their property.



Okello wants the government to provide relief food and compensate the flood-affected persons for losses incurred as well as temporal structures for their shelter.

91,91,FL-2019-000163-UGA,Vanessa Nakate: 'Many people are not yet aware of the dangers of climate change' - DW (English),https://www.dw.com/en/fridays-for-future-uganda-climate-change-africa-activism-food-security-water/a-54732304,"From Uganda and in her early 20s, Vanessa Nakate started protesting against climate inaction outside the Ugandan government gates in 2019. She's on a mission to raise awareness about the issue within Africa and internationally because she has seen the impacts of climate change already on her own community.

DW: When you started Fridays for Future activism in Uganda, you were very much alone right at the beginning. At what point did you think, 'OK, I should continue this or I'm going to give up'?

Vanessa Nakate: I just felt like I had to continue striking, especially because I was still doing it by myself. But then as time went on, more and more people started to get involved in different parts of the country doing the climate strikes. And also in the entire African continent, more activists started coming up and doing the climate strikes and demanding action. And to me, that is enough of a motivation to keep me doing activism, knowing that I am not doing it alone, and that there are millions of young people from different parts of the world striking and demanding climate action.

How does climate activism in your country differ from what it looks like in Europe? We're used to seeing big Fridays For Future strikes here, but what does it look like in Uganda?

Well, of course there is a big difference between the activism in Uganda and in Europe. This is mainly because of two things.

One is awareness. Many people are not yet aware of the dangers. They don't have the facts. They don't have the clear science about what is happening when it comes to the climate crisis.

And then the other thing is freedom of expression. Freedom of expression is not the same as we see it is in Europe and it's also harder for students here to walk out of school and do the climate strikes.

If I want to do climate strikes with students, I have to go in the schools because many of them, they have a fear of walking out of school. Just walking out would subject you to either suspension or expulsion.

Also getting permits for marches every Friday is very hard, especially if you don't have a strong organization that is behind you, that is supporting you. So activism in my country — or probably in any other African country — is different because of such restrictions.

With that in mind, how do you get people motivated to go on strikes?

By sharing on social media. That is — mainly on Twitter and Facebook — I would share my strikes every Friday and many people would ask questions about what I was doing and why I was doing that.

The other way is going into schools and requesting principals, director of schools to talk to students on Friday so that I get to discuss with them the challenges that our planet faces and their role in securing a better future.

One other way, we've been doing community reach-outs where we go to local communities and do cleanups, because most of these people, they don't have access maybe to a television. They don't watch the news. They don't know the challenges that the world is facing. So through these local reach-outs or doing cleanups, we get to speak to them, we get to explain to them how they can protect the planet, what they can do for our home, because all of us have a responsibility to play.

The Global Strike 4 Climate in Uganda's capital Kampala in 2019

Climate change is obviously a difficult thing to explain to anybody in the world. But for you, what are the main issues locally that you are dealing with?

I have clearly seen the danger that climate change places on people's lives and the danger is mainly an issue of food scarcity and water scarcity for people.

A large percentage of the people in Uganda are heavily dependent on agriculture as a source of survival, and that is mainly the people in the rural communities. It also affects those in the urban centers because they get food from the rural communities. It also brings about other problems of seeing more street children on the streets of Kampala. This is because many of them, they're trying to run away from their lands. They're trying to find a better way of survival.

Also, availability of access to clean water for the people, because when it floods, that means the water will still be contaminated. It's submerged even toilets, not just the farms, it also submerged drainage. That means any water source that the community was relying on was also contaminated by the dirt from the toilets. So you find that, even in the flood there is a water scarcity.

You, as well as I guess your colleagues one could call them from Europe, have a whole set of different agendas regarding what issues are important within Europe, as opposed to what is important across Africa or Asia. Has it ever been difficult working with them?

No. I believe in a way, yes, the demands are different, the urgency is different — when it comes to Europe, it isn't as urgent as it is in Africa with the climate crisis. So in Europe, you find that most of the activists, they are mainly targeting the politicians and the leaders in making decisions that will ensure that different parts of the world are protected, that will ensure that the Earth is protected.

I personally may not have reach to the leaders who determine the existence of the fossil fuel industry, who determine whether we are going to transition to a more sustainable future. Most of those leaders, they have so much influence as well in some of the countries on the African continent. So I feel like if they're able to reach out to those leaders in the European Parliament and put pressure on them to take the decisions that would save our planet, that also helps me out, that also helps the people of my country.

As you point out, places across Africa, whether it's the Sahel, whether it's the coastal areas, they have much more to lose than what we see in Europe. But for you, how does this make you feel when you can see that Africans are actually in a more dangerous position than the Europeans are, but that Africans have so little influence on that?

As a climate activist, of course, I understand that we have tried so much to ask for representation of every activist on the world stage, in discussions. But it is one thing to see that representation, but it's another thing for that representation to carry the same weight.

The weight of influence — it is not the same. The question is: Will they listen to what I will say? Will they find it important if I say it? What if I say the same thing today and no one pays attention to it and another activist from Europe says the same thing and it's given much attention?

What's your message to people across Africa about climate? No pressure.

For the people of Africa, no one is going to fight for you when it comes to the climate crisis.

If Africa experiences issues with the climate crisis, many times, we first look out for international media to talk about it. But now we need African media.

We can only save our continent if we work together. And unfortunately, it's not something that we are seeing right now.

Recently, you've actually been tweeting in German to try and get the message across. What made you do this?

Well, I did that because I was really angry and disturbed by the fact that Germany chose to push coal to 2038. I feel like that helps them and that doesn't help communities that are already being affected by the climate crisis. I feel like 2038 is too late. It's unnecessary and very dangerous for communities that are already facing devastating impacts of climate change.

So tweeting in German was a message to Germany, to the entire world. It was a message saying: 'I am watching you, as an activist. We are watching you and the decisions that you are making, they are not good for us. They are not good for our future. You have to reconsider and understand that we have no time left.'

The year 2020 will, without a shadow of a doubt, be etched into the collective memory of human society for a long, long time. It began with the novel coronavirus emerging out of China’s Wuhan and reaching all corners of Earth. It's only now, with the year coming to an end, that the world has begun its retort against COVID-19 through vaccination drives.

While a majority of the global population remained indoors all year to escape the clutches of the pandemic, natural disasters were out in full force, confronting many parts of the world with a catastrophic double whammy.

Here are five such major natural calamities from across the world in the bleak year that was 2020:

Locust Attacks in East Africa and Asia

The 2020 locust outbreak was the worst Kenya has seen in 70 years, and the worst in 25 years for countries like Ethiopia, Somalia, and India. It began in May 2018, when Cyclone Mekunu produced heavy rains over a vast, unpopulated desert in the southern Arabian Peninsula, thereby allowing locusts to breed there undetected. Thereafter, Cyclone Luban in October 2018 exacerbated the locust breeding, enabling three generations of locusts to mass-reproduce over a nine-month period. This led to an 8,000-fold increase in the locust population across the Arabian desert.

These mega-swarms then began migrating as per the wind direction, and by April 2020, the aerial armies had successfully invaded 23 countries—African nations like Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Uganda; Arabian countries like Yemen, Saudi Arabia; Paraguay and Argentina in South America; and South Asian nations such as Iran, Pakistan, and India.

The outbreak in India began in late 2019 and January 2020, with kilometre-wide swarms disrupting lives across ten states—Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Haryana, and Uttarakhand.

Subsequently, the Rajasthan government reported crop damage of 33%, while less than 33% crop damage was reported by the governments of Haryana (6520-hectare area), Madhya Pradesh (4400 ha), Maharashtra (806 ha), Uttar Pradesh (488 ha), and Uttarakhand (267 ha).

Bushfires in Australia

Bushfires in Australia tend to be a regular and widespread occurrence. However, the fires witnessed on the continent last summer—towards the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020—were unusually intense and far more destructive, earning this bushfire season the name ‘Black Summer’. While both natural and manmade causes started these fires, factors like high temperatures, drought conditions, high fuel load (accumulation of fallen bark, leaf litter, small branches), and global warming combined to enhance this disaster.

These raging bushfires led to tremendous destruction across the eastern half of the country, burning an estimated 18.6 million hectares of forests, destroying over 5,900 buildings, and directly killing at least 34 people. A further 445 fatalities were caused due to smoke inhalation, and 65,000 people were displaced, as this disaster affected nearly 80 per cent of Australians one way or another.

The fires also reportedly killed or affected at least 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs, also pushing some threatened species such as the long-footed potoroo, the marsupial, and the Kangaroo Island glossy black cockatoo closer to extinction! These ecological consequences aside, the bushfires also caused tremendous air pollution and carbon emission.

Overall, economists estimate the 2020 bushfires may have cost over 103 billion Australian Dollars in property damage and economic losses, thereby making them Australia's costliest natural disaster to date.

Cyclone Amphan

The year 2020 was another active year in terms of cyclones in the North Indian Ocean, with nine depressions forming in the region and five of them intensifying into cyclonic storms and more. Together, these systems caused damage worth $15.78 billion (one lakh fifty-seven thousand crore rupees), and killed about 269 people.

Advertisement Among these, Amphan—the first super cyclonic storm to have formed in the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 Odisha cyclone—was one of the strongest cyclones to hit India, while also being the costliest cyclone ever recorded in the North Indian Ocean in terms of damage caused.

On May 18, Amphan hit its peak intensity with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 260 km/h (160 mph), and two days later, made landfall over West Bengal. It caused great damage across coastal West Bengal, Odisha, Northeast India, and Bangladesh claiming 128 lives and causing overall destruction worth $13.7 billion (one lakh thirty-seven thousand crore rupees).

A few months later, Cyclone Nivar became the second-most destructive cyclone to hit India in 2020, as it made landfall over Tamil Nadu in late November and caused damage worth $600 million (four thousand crore rupees), killing 14. Other cyclones, namely Nisarga, Gati and Burevi, did cause significant local impacts. But, fortunately, the damages were not as high as Amphan and Nivar.

China Floods

Southern China, particularly the Yangtze basin and its tributaries, was affected by severe floods this year, as heavy rains wreaked havoc across the region during the rainy season between June-September. This disaster also extended to central and eastern China during July, effectively creating the worst flood situation the region has experienced since at least 1998. A total of 443 rivers were flooded nationwide, with 33 of them swelling to the highest levels ever recorded!

As per the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), a spike in rainfall activity—caused by climate change-induced rise in vapours emergence from the Indian and Pacific oceans—led to the flooding. Furthermore, anthropogenic factors like the reclamation of lakes and wetlands, urban development, and mass-disappearance of lakes also helped escalate the events.

By August, the floods had killed at least 219 people across the country, affected about 63.46 million people, and damaged 54,000 houses, 76 key national cultural relics, and 187 provincial cultural heritage sites. Overall, the disaster caused a direct economic loss of 178.96 billion CNY.

The destruction in China aside, the release of water from these swollen rivers may also have contributed to the flooding that occurred in adjoining India’s northeastern state of Assam during this period.

Assam Floods

Monsoon floods are a common occurrence for northeast India. But, the year 2020’s Indian monsoon season was particularly difficult for Assam, as the state remained constantly flooded due to persistent spells of heavy rainfall and above-average seasonal precipitation in the region.

The initial flooding began with heavy showers in May, and it wasn’t until October that the statewide situation began to improve. By then, however, the floods had already affected over 50 lakh residents across 30 districts and 5,474 villages, killed 123 and forced over 1.5 lakh people to seek refuge in 627 relief camps and 1662 relief distribution centres set-up by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA). The floods also induced landslides, which further claimed 26 more lives.

Floods also exacerbated the spread of novel coronavirus in Assam, with the state recording over 2 lakh confirmed COVID-19 cases in this period. Stagnant waters and lack of access to clean water, hygiene supplies are also believed to have caused a spike in dengue, malaria, and Japanese encephalitis cases.

The inundation and subsequent landslides damaged bridges, government buildings, roads, embankments, and schools while putting at least 2.67 lakh hectares of crops to ruin. The flooding also affected the wildlife within the state, with more than 45,000 domesticated animals forced to flee or be abandoned, more than 150 wild animals rescued from the Kaziranga National Park, and 125 animals in the park, including 12 rhinoceros, succumbing to the floodwaters.

KAMPALA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people have been displaced as a result of heavy rains, which triggered floods and landslides and caused havoc in several parts of Uganda, a top government official said on Sunday.

Musa Ecweru, minister of state for relief and disaster preparedness, told Xinhua by telephone that torrential rains which started last month, marking the first major rainfall season in the country, have displaced people, destroyed homes, farms, washed away roads and other infrastructure.

He said most of the affected areas include the mountainous and hilly areas in eastern and western Uganda, low lying and plain areas in eastern region.

""This problem is across the whole country. Now there are thousands of people who are displaced. The officers in my office are compiling the figures (numbers of people) and extent of damage for each district across Uganda,"" said Ecweru.

""We are going to sit down and see how to handle the magnitude of the problem. We shall see how to dispatch some support to the affected persons,"" he said.

The Office of the Prime Minister has been running alert messages, warning that the country will face floods, landslides, strong winds and lightning as the first rain season peaks.

""We have been running alert messages on televisions and radios. These alerts started running about five months ago. We have been telling and warning the country of heavy rains and its dangerous effects,"" said Ecweru.

He said landslides have hit the hilly western district of Kabale.

Ecweru said people living in mountainous areas, flood prone areas as well as wetlands should immediately vacate to safe places as heavy rains continue.

At least two children were killed by floods following heavy rains in the western district of Rubanda on Saturday, according to police.

According to the weather department, several parts of the country especially western and eastern regions, are currently experiencing normal to above normal rainfall, with destructive effects.

In its March-May seasonal rainfall outlook, the Uganda National Meteorological Authority warned of enhanced rainfall over several parts of the country that could result into disasters such as landslides and foods, leading to loss of lives and destruction of property in the first major rain season.

Seventeen people are confirmed dead in the south western region of the country, and a child is still missing.

Speaking to RFI Emmanuel Okecho, a Disaster Protect Officer with Uganda's Office of the Prime Minister explained “the south-west in flood prone because of naturally low-lying areas and marshes.”

Bridges and roads have been submerged by the heaviest rainfall to hit Uganda in over 25 years, complicating relief and rescue efforts.

“The floods have caused millions of shillings worth of damage,” Monica Azuba, Uganda’s Transport Minister, told RFI by telephone from Kampala adding, “the government is prioritising the humanitarian situation before assessing the full extent of infrastructural damage.”

The government dispatched an assessment team on Monday, and the Red Cross are leading search and rescue efforts in the east and south west of the country.

Scores of people are unaccounted for after mudslides engulfed homes killing at least eight people in the foothills of Mount Elgon over the weekend. This, despite concerted efforts by the government and environmental organisations to combat deforestation.

East Africa has been hit by torrential rains in recent weeks unleashing deadly flooding in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania and now Uganda. Two million people have been affected.

“These floods are worse than in 2010 because it has been raining almost constantly for two months,” says Okecho.

The rains are expected to continue at least until the end of December.

December 09, 2019 09:45 AM

KAMPALA - Ugandan authorities say the death toll from a week of floods and mudslides has risen to 36 people and left thousands stranded after heavy rains swept across a mountainous region.

A week of heavy rains caused floods and mudslides in Eastern Uganda’s Bugisu and Bundibugyo regions near Rwenzori Mountain.

Authorities say the flooding has taken a toll with the loss of life and property, and with thousands more left stranded.

The Ugandan Red Cross’s Irene Nakasita says search and rescue operations in the regions are hampered as most roads have been washed away.

“And the decision has been taken to put up a transit shelter until the situation normalizes. So, most likely Bubukwang transit center is going to house close to 700 people who are displaced in Bundibugyo,” she said.

Meanwhile, Uganda’s State Minister for Disaster Preparedness and Relief Musa Ecweru says there are concerns about water-borne disease outbreaks in flood-affected areas.

“Now, there’s a risk of contamination of water and if that is not handled well, then we are going to risk another phase of a challenge, an outbreak of cholera which will compound our humanitarian intervention,” he said.

Ecweru says the government has released $5.4 million for emergency drugs to treat water-borne diseases, inflatable boats, tarps, blankets, food, and repairing bridges.

Ugandan authorities say the flooding is expected to recede in January as the weather improves.

Scientists have long warned that rising ocean temperatures are making seasonal rains more severe and more frequent.

The United Nation’s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) last week (Dec 4) said unusually heavy rainfall and flooding in East Africa has affected over 2.8 million people and left at least 280 dead.

UNOCHA said the unusually heavy rainfall was driven by the differences in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the Indian Ocean.

The UN office said rains were expected to diminish in the weeks ahead but heavy rains would likely persist into December and intensify in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.","Mon, 09 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['continue', 'heavy', 'ugandas', 'say', 'week', 'waterborne', 'ugandan', 'rains', 'floods', 'uganda', 'flooding', 'death', 'toll', 'unusually', 'left', 'rises']",

Currently, Kanyangeya primary school is hosting over 98 households. The area LCI chairperson, Deogracious Isemamba said the school premises and toilets are now being used by a large community.

KASESE - Following the outbreak of floods and landslides that ravaged several areas of mountainous Kasese district, residents continue to express worry over the next course of education after several schools were washed away.

Allan Kambale a resident of Namuhuga ward in Bulembia said schools such as Bulembia primary school, Kilembe and Royal ranges secondary schools, were greatly affected by the floods, whereas others cannot be accessed after several roads and bridges were damaged.

Currently, Kanyangeya primary school is hosting over 98 households. The area LCI chairperson, Deogracious Isemamba said the school premises and toilets are now being used by a large community.

""Even if the school lock-down is lifted soon, pupils will have nowhere to study from unless an alternative area is gazetted for resettlement,"" Isemamba reasoned.

Similar concerns were raised by Rehema Aryema who decried the inevitable pressure on surviving school-premises, saying, learners are bound to meet a big challenge on how to resume studies when the lock-down is lifted.

In May this year, Kasese was hit by disastrous floods. The floods started on May 7 and peaked on the morning of May 10. Another disaster followed on May 21, in areas of Mpondwe-Bwera, where flash floods and landslides further destroyed bridges and infrastructure, leading to the death of more than 10 people.

The current flooding started with river Nyamwamba bursting its banks in areas of Kasese municipality sweeping away Kyanjuki-Katiri bridge and Kilembe mines hospital infrastructure. Simultaneous floods also occurred along rivers of Lhubiriha in Bukonzo west with impacts in the sub-counties of Kitholhu, Karambi and Mpondwe-Lhubiriha town council while river Nyamugasani in Bukonzo East had impacts in the Sub-counties of Kyondo, Kyarumba and Kisinga.

River Mubuku floods, on the other hand, had impacts on the communities of Maliba, Bugoye and Karusandara. Equally affected, were town councils of Ibanda-Kyanya, Kisinga and Mubuku.

Health services still a challenge

Asinet Kabugho recounts the incident of flooding which left several communities cut-off from each other. Some pregnant mothers remained stuck up in the hilly areas and couldn't access medical services.

""The situation was only mitigated by a certain group of volunteers who transported affected people in ambulances,"" Kabugho recollects.

After the nearest Kilembe mines hospital premises were damaged by floods, medical services were shifted to premises of St. Micheal Kindergarten and at Catholic social centre (Karitus hall) in Kasese town.

Dr Edward Wefula the hospital superintendent calls for an urgent alternative water source, mortuary, incinerator, placenta pit and more toilets, saying, the new premises were not designed for a hospital.

However, Sr. Teopista Basemera the Kilembe hospital senior administrator, expressed hope of having more structures with a 200-bed capacity.

Malteser International a worldwide humanitarian relief agency, through the prime minister's office and the ministry of health, committed relief and recovery aid worth sh868m for the period of 3months since May 12.

According to Laura Beutler the technical coordinator for emergency medical services under Malteser, as of May 13, over 39,000 people had been affected by the floods.

""We have made more than 1,317 transferals out of which, 171 babies were successfully delivered from complicated pregnancies,"" noted Laura, adding that, eight of the born babies, were delivered from within ambulances.

She hence expressed a need to build capacity in pre-hospital care, where a formidable team of residents and health workers can be trained to administer first aid before or while transferring a patient to the hospital.

For over 3months of rescue and providing relief support, Malteser trained and passed out 23 Kasese residents in providing emergency medical services among which include, first aid and ambulance operations.

""We are striving to establish an Emergency Medical Services project in Kasese so that people can respond by themselves and activate support in an immediate and structured way,"" noted Laura.

She, however, expressed fear over the possible outbreak of diseases especially the COVID-19. She said the preventive measures are largely missing at all settlement camps.

The population of the people in camp is high, the implementation of the COVID-19 SOPs is hard. Social distancing and hand washing are hard to implement.","Mon, 03 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['worried', 'health', 'medical', 'areas', 'kilembe', 'victims', 'services', 'kasese', 'affected', 'floods', 'uganda', 'premises', 'school', 'hospital', 'education']",

KAMPALA, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan government has released 20 billion shillings (about 5.5 million U.S. dollars) for emergency response after deadly landslides and floods hit parts of the east African country.

Musa Ecweru, minister of state for relief, disaster preparedness and refugees told reporters here on Friday that the funds have been released under the 'life-saving and rescue' phase to address the landslides situation in the mountainous areas and in flooding areas.

At least four people were killed, five injured and over 6,000 people displaced on Tuesday after landslides triggered by torrential rains hit the three villages of Namasa, Naposhi and Shukururu in the eastern district of Bududa.

In neighboring Sironko district, four people including two children were killed while 4,000 others were displaced and plantations, livestock lost after multiple landslides and floods hit Nabodi village, Zesui sub county on Tuesday, according to the Office of the Prime Minister.

Ecweru said the funds will be used for procurement of relief food, tarpaulins, blankets, drugs for water borne diseases, inflatable boats and culverts for fixing washed away bridges.

""Post disaster needs assessment will be conducted in January 2020 to determine total level of damage and losses and actions for the recovery and reconstruction,"" he said.

Ecweru said a rapid assessment conducted in the most affected mountainous districts of Bududa, Sironko, Manafwa, Namisidwa and Mbale puts the number of displaced persons at 25,000 while some 85,000 households were affected and 21,500 hectares of crop and plantation damaged.

At least 55,000 people have been displaced and over 120,000 hectares of crops destroyed by floods in the low lying Teso and Bukedi sub regions also in the eastern part of the country.

Ecweru said the northwestern part of the country has equally suffered losses of crop and homes to flooding following high water levels on River Nile.

Other parts of the country, according to the minister, have also suffered some considerable losses due to the ongoing torrential rains.","Fri, 06 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",,"['landslides', 'deadly', 'torrential', 'releases', 'govt', 'hit', 'funds', 'displaced', 'losses', 'floods', 'uganda', 'emergency', 'sub', 'suffered', 'water', 'xinhua']",

• Delayed and below-average cumulative rainfall has delayed planting by at least three weeks in northern and parts of eastern Uganda. Near-average rainfall is forecasted in May and will likely support the development of late-maturing crops. However, the timing of the first season cereal and legume harvests will likely be delayed through early July, and aggregate production is expected to vary by subregion depending on the local amount and distribution of rainfall. Subnational production deficits are likely in northern and eastern Uganda, where rainfall may not be spread evenly in the crop cycle.

• Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes are expected through at least September in most bimodal areas, driven by carryover stocks from 2020, below-average staple food prices, seasonal agricultural labor income during the March to May planting season, and the anticipated average harvest in July. However, Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are likely among households in flood-affected areas and some urban areas, where livelihood activities were significantly disrupted in 2020 and income sources are still below pre-pandemic levels.

• In Karamoja, an increasing number of households face widening food consumption gaps and are utilizing negative livelihoods coping strategies, increasing the share of the population that is experiencing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. While food prices are generally stable and below average in most reference markets, the casual labor wage and the price of firewood, charcoal, and goats are declining, resulting in significantly below-average terms of trade and reduced household purchasing power. Below-average rainfall to date resulted in limited on-farm labor opportunities and delayed land preparation and planting, while others lack access to seeds.

• Planned and funded food assistance (cash and in-kind) equivalent to a 60 percent ration has sustained Crisis! (IPC Phase 3!) outcomes in April. Thereafter, an anticipated pipeline break in food assistance funding may result in further reductions in rations and food security outcomes. Refugees with arable plots are engaging in plowing and planting activities, though some lack access to inputs like seeds as others have yet to recover from the impacts of earlier COVID-19 movement restrictions on food and income sources.

By Stephen Otage More by this Author

The Ministry of Water and Environment has warned all people living on river banks and lakeshores to vacate before impending floods expected from the current rising water levels.

Dr Florence Grace Odongo, the director for water resources management at the Ministry of Water and Environment, said the water level on Lake Victoria, has risen to 13.4 meters, which is only short of 8cm to reach the levels of last year and yet the rain season has just started.

“Lake Victoria is getting full and the only way water exits it is through the River Nile, which drains into Lake Kyoga and Lake Albert that empty it but all these are also getting full of water. The only thing we are going to see is flooding of River Banks and Lake Shores,” she said.

Dr Odongo was on Monday presenting her ministry’s performance in the implementation of the 2016 NRM Manifesto in Kampala on Monday.





Water levels

Dr Odongo explained that from last year’s experience where the water level on Lake Victoria hit 13.48 meters, the highest in 124 years, the situation is not looking good. This is because, she said, Lake Victoria basin traps water from Rwanda, Tanzania, DR Congo, Kenya, Tanzania and all the rain in Uganda yet the underground water system is full because of encroachment on wetlands and forests.

Mr Willis Bashasha, the director in-charge of the Manifesto Implementation Unit, noted that much as the ministry has performed well in increasing access to water and sanitation services across the country, it has done little to contain encroachment and destruction of forests and wetlands across the country.

Mr Sam Cheptoris, the minister of Water and Environment, admitted that much as they promised to increase wetland coverage from 10 per cent in 2016 to 12.4 per cent in 2021, it currently stands at 8.9 per cent due to increased population pressure. He attributed this to low enforcement of the existing laws.

“We have very few enforcement officers under the environment police. Under the 2019 Environment Act, we were supposed to recruit our own force like the Uganda Wildlife Authority but unfortunately, we do not have command over the Environmental Police to protect wetlands and forests,” Mr Cheptoris said.

The Environmental Protection Police Unit was created in December 2011 to support the Ministry of Water and Environment in enforcing environmental laws and regulations.

On Monday, the ministry was among the four ministries, which presented how they implemented the promises the ruling government made to Ugandans during the 2016 election campaigns. Other ministries are those of Science Innovations and Technology, Agriculture and Public Service.

Government has ordered all people living in flood-prone areas around Lake Victoria to relocate to safer areas as the country continues to receive heavy rain.

Mr Raphael Magyezi, the Minister for Local Government, asked district authorities to make arrangements and ensure that people swiftly vacate the affected landing sites on the lake shores.

“Heavy rains have already caused floods in some parts of the country and it is upon the victims with the help of district leaders to vacate flood prone areas for their safety,” Mr Magyezi said in an interview on Wednesday.

Last year, thousands of people were displaced after the rising water levels submerged a number of landing sites and islands around Lake Victoria and Lake Albert.

The victims were temporarily housed in makeshift shelters on the mainland as they waited for government to resettle them.

However, before government implemented the planned resettlement plan, many victims started returning to the islands and landing sites, claiming that the resettlement programme had delayed.

“The government’s plan to resettle the victims is underway although we have been constrained by lack of funds. However, people should not wait for floods to sweep them away. Let them relocate to safer places to save their lives,” Mr Magyezi said.

Masaka District alone has close to 20,000 flood victims, who were left homeless after water submerged Lambu, Kaziru, Kisuku, Malembo, and Kachanga landing sites last year.

Mr Aron Ahikiriza, a fisherman at Bukakkata Landing Site in Masaka District, said although the water levels are rising again, the lake remains their only source of livelihood.

“We can decide to sleep in rented houses far away from the landing site like we did the whole of last year but we cannot completely abandon the landing site because this where we earn a living,” he said.

Mr Rashid Babu, the manager of Mpongo Company Limited, which manages Lambu Landing Site, said government should expedite the process to permanently resettle the victims.

“Government should not be just talking, let them walk the talk because these people have been patient ever since they were promised to be resettled,” he said.

Mr Aloysius Jjuko, the chairperson of Bukakkata Sub-county, said the fishermen and their families are already scared of the rising water levels.

“We ask President Museveni to provide a permanent solution to the flood victims at landing sites. These people cannot resettle themselves unless they are helped by government,” he said.

Issue

Last year, rising water levels in various areas on Lake Victoria, Lake Kyoga, and Lake Albert shorelines wreaked havoc on many landing sites in the districts of Wakiso, Masaka, Mpigi, Kyotera, Kalangala, Mukono, Buikwe, Buvuma, Mayuge, Kayunga, Nakasongola, and Ntoroko displacing more than 40,000 people.

In Kasese District more than 100,000 people were displaced after major rivers in the area including Nyamwamba, Mubuku, Nyamughasana, and Lhubiriha burst their banks.

Susan Afoyocan’s fear of losing her restaurant business started when she saw the first drops of rain.

It was at the onset of the rainy season last month, as the farming communities eagerly began preparing their gardens that she knew she had to do something about these warning signs. Last year, around the same time, heavy rains destroyed Afoyocan’s local eatery and washed away her fruit stall in the process.

And now the 33-year-old was determined to protect her source of livelihood as she set about renovating and remodeling her restaurant as a measure to mitigate the floods.

“I know what happens when it rains here heavily…” Afoyocan, a mother of three, said as she instructed local laborers who were busy carrying tin roofs for covering her restaurant.

“I have to act very fast now or else I will lose everything again.”

As climate changes continues to take toll on Uganda –and globally— the adverse effects of the extreme weather—characterized by erratic rains and raging floods—have triggered growing concerns from climate activists and civil society organization (CSOs) who blame the government of failing to build infrastructures and enforcing preventing policies (such as tree planting along river banks and flood plains to act as a drag on flood waters) that protect disaster–prone areas like Elegu.

The business community operating at the border town have for years continuously battled the raging floods, especially during the rainy season. River Unyama, a nearby water course which often bursts its banks, has also on many occasion not spared the low-lying border town whenever it rains heavily. In November last year, more than 700 people were displaced by floods, and eight others killed, leaving 2,000 acres of crops destroyed following heavy rains in the marshy border town.

Revenue washed away

And now local leaders are accusing the government of making ‘empty promises’ instead of addressing the problem urgently. In 2018, government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Trade and Industries for the 18 billion shillings-project meant to mitigate floods in Elegu. The project, funded by Trade Mark East Africa, was meant to widen the banks of River Unyama to improve the drainage system at Elegu Town.

But four years later, nothing has been done except for only the feasibility study that was carried out by an engineering team at the construction site.

“We were promised air and now the rains are back [again],” said Bosco Onen who works at a retail shop. “For how long shall we wait while we suffer?”

Elegu, a border town with a population of close to 12,000 people, is the biggest revenue earner for Amuru district. Operations by Amuru’s local government fail to run smoothly due to financial constraints resulting majorly from the low revenue collections from the local businesses that are affected by floods.

‘[Trade ministry officials] are not feeling the pinch of the suffering of our community members whose businesses are affected [by] floods,” said Michael Lakony, Amuru District Chairman, adding, ""[They should] come to our rescue...in making sure that we curb the disaster.”

There is also information deficit regarding the progress of the project. And at moment, the Trade Ministry officials are being accused of being cagey— when it comes to giving out information about the project— by local leaders who claim they’ve been left in the dark for most of the time.

When this reporter contacted Julius Kasirye, the Project Manager for Border Export Zone–BEZ under the Ministry of Trade and Industries for comment, said:” …the matter can only be best responded to by either the Permanent Secretary [of] the Minister of Trade and Industry.”

The Trade Ministry Permanent Secretary didn’t respond to our repeated phone calls either.

But for now, as the rainy season continues to pound on, the business community at Elegu have to remain resilient and survive on their own as they wait for government support. On a recent day, as the clouds began to open up, a group of young women rushed to collect pieces of cassava spread outside on thin plastic paper for sun drying. Nearby, a young mother was busy rebuking some of kids who were playing outside in the middle of the chaos.

""If nothing is done [to help us], we will keep suffering,"" said Afoyocan.","Mon, 26 Apr 2021 15:50:05 GMT",https://www.blackstarnews.com/sites/all/themes/blackstar/favicon.ico,"['project', 'demand', 'mitigate', 'season', 'ministry', 'town', 'border', 'stalls', 'uganda', 'promised', 'elegu', 'rains', 'mega', 'floods', 'traders', 'local', 'trade']", 
4,4,FL-2019-000066-UGA,Battling Rising Water in Uganda's Wetlands - Global Press Journal,https://globalpressjournal.com/africa/uganda/battling-rising-water-ugandas-wetlands/,"KIKUUBE, UGANDA — Standing on the shore of Lake Albert, on Uganda’s western border, Sanyu Sanday looks out past the surf to where her small mud house stands partially submerged in the water. She’s salvaged what she can — her mattress and other possessions sit on a small motorboat — but after living on the lakeshore for the past two years, she’s unsure about where she will go.

“The raging waters have cut us off from what we knew as home,” Sanyu says.

Severe flooding has stricken Uganda in recent years, as changing weather patterns have led to increased rainfall, causing lakes and rivers to swell. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced across the country, particularly in flood-prone areas surrounding Lake Victoria to the south, Lake Albert to the west, and Lake Kyoga in the center of the country. It’s a situation that is likely to become worse as global temperatures rise and people continue to destroy Uganda’s wetlands to build roads, houses and other infrastructure.

Since October 2019, rising temperatures in the Indian Ocean have led to intense and prolonged rainfall in Uganda, causing water levels in Lake Victoria, one of Africa’s Great Lakes, to reach historic highs not seen since the 1960s. This has caused extreme flooding in the Lake Victoria basin.

“Too much rain means too much collected in the basin, which overspills and floods neighboring places,” says George William Omony, a senior meteorologist at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority.

Edna Namara, GPJ Uganda Sanyu Sanday’s mattress and other possessions are loaded in a small motorboat on Lake Albert. Her house, in the background, lies partially submerged in the water.

The government has been working to relocate thousands impacted by the flooding. But people like Sanyu, who built homes in parts of the Lake Victoria basin without obtaining official authorization, haven’t been included in these resettlement plans, according to Jackson Twinomujuni, commissioner of International and Transboundary Water Affairs at the Ministry of Water and Environment.

Achidria Tony, a spokesperson for the National Environment Management Authority, says that while the government can’t stop climate change or the increased rainfall it brings, officials are trying to prepare for rising water levels.

“What we do is ensure natural flood control systems such as wetlands and forests are not degraded and are instead used sustainably,” he says.

Decades ago, Uganda’s wetlands were able to absorb such flooding. But infrastructure development has caused the country’s wetlands to dwindle — from 32,000 square kilometers (12,355 square miles) in 1964 down to 26,308 square kilometers (10,158 square miles) as of 2005, according to the Ministry of Water and Environment.

“In 1961, 1964, the water was contained without alarm, because there was enough forest cover and swamps,” says Twinomujuni, referring to the historic rainfall Uganda experienced in the 1960s. “There were no paved homes and drainage channels, which do not retain any rainwater, but leave it with the only alternative to flow into the lake, hence the rise.”

Edna Namara, GPJ Uganda Nankya Amina points to the flooded ground floor of her house, along the shores of Lake Victoria in Kampala. Uganda’s wetlands have been severely depleted, due to construction and development.

Rising water is a problem in Uganda’s capital city of Kampala as well. Annual damages from flooding, which were less than $10 million in 2013, could increase to between $33 million and $102 million by 2050, according to a report by Wilson Truman Okaka, a lecturer at Kyambogo University in Kampala, who researches climate change.

In 2014, Nankya Amina built a house with rental units in a wetland area within the city’s Makindye division, along the shores of Lake Victoria. She hoped to generate income to help support herself and her six children. By law, property owners must obtain authorization from the National Environment Management Authority before they can build. But Nankya didn’t submit her plans for approval.

“I knew environmentalists would not approve my plot, since it was in the wetland,” Nankya says. “Also, I did not want to spend my money on processing the plan.”

Now she regrets the decision. The ground floor of the house is submerged in water and continues to sink, forcing her to live in a small wooden structure nearby. Even this living situation may be temporary.

“Nankya and 385 households in Makindye West division have to relocate and give back the water its territory,” says Achidria. “We sent out early warnings telling them to move before the floods.”

Sanyu, for her part, has grown accustomed to being uprooted. She initially came to Uganda in 2018 after fleeing violence in her native Democratic Republic of Congo, just across Lake Albert. She has been living in Uganda without legal documents, making money by catching and selling fish, while taking periodic trips back to DRC to check on her aging mother.

She had hoped to remain in the area and find employment cooking for workers coming to labor in the nearby oil fields. With her home destroyed, that future is now in doubt.

Environmental experts and local leaders in Butaleja District have blamed the re-occurrence of floods to massive environmental degradation and lack of a political will to mitigate the effects of such disasters.

The experts say swamps and river banks of Manafwa and Nakwasi have been mismanaged by the locals due to poor agricultural methods.

They also blame the floods on failure by the government to erect embankments on River Manafwa and River Nakwasi and restore flood early warning systems.

The system, which stopped functioning in 2016, had been installed by the government in 2015 to alert locals of the rising water levels.

The concern comes following the occurrence of floods that hit the district on Friday, killing one person, destroying property worth millions of shillings and displacing many residents.

The yet unidentified resident was swept by water as he attempted to cross Nakwasi River in Leresi Cell.

Houses were submerged and household items such as beddings, clothes and crops were washed away by the ravaging floods triggered by the downpour from Mt Elgon. Transport was also paralysed and schools rendered inaccessible.

The most affected areas were Butaleja Town Council and Busolwe Town Council.

When Daily Monitor visited the affected areas, the displaced people were wandering without food, shelter, clothing, among other necessities.

The district has been experiencing back-to-back floods since 1976, and environmentalists further predict that this is likely to continue.

“Environmental degradation is rife in Butaleja District and it has been worsened by the laissez-faire approach to the disaster by authorities,” Mr James Wire, an agribusiness consultant, said.

“As of now, there are no visible efforts at an institutional level to stop this problem and it is worrying,” he added.

Mr Wire said there is a need for the district to enact by-laws that will protect the environment.

“Simple approaches such as requiring a permit before a tree is cut down in public or private land may seem harsh but bear fruits in the long run,” he said, adding that residents should be given seedlings to plant trees on the river banks.

The chairperson of Masulula “B” Village in Himutu Sub-county, Mr Mesulamu Wabaye, said there is limited land and this has forced the populace to encroach on what should be the green spaces, especially the swamps.

Ms Lamula Were, the district senior environmental officer, said the situation has been worsened by locals erecting residential houses on the river banks while others are farming and quarrying near the rivers.

“People should stop digging up to the river banks. Butaleja District is on a low land area,” she said.

Ms Were said about 60 per cent of wetlands in the district have been encroached on. She, however, said the environmental law will not spare those who are encroaching on the wetlands.

She said the district environment office has started implementing a presidential directive to restore wetlands.

Encroachment

Mr Higenyi Kemba, a resident and an opinion leader, said the main cause of the floods is human encroachment.

“Human encroachment around the river banks causes heavy silting that fills up the river bed, hence reducing the size of the waterway. When this happens, the route that water should take becomes shallow,” Mr Kemba said.

Mr Kemba said people should plant bamboo trees on either side of the river banks all the way from Bugisu Sub-region to Butaleja and Bugwere.

“Bamboo trees will stop the silting. When this is done, the deposits already in the river can then be removed...,” he said.

Mr Moses Wegulo, a resident, said repeated floods have affected them, especially in terms of food security and road network.

For example since this year started, the district has been hit by floods four times leaving hundreds of people homeless.

“This road from Mbale-Butaleja-Busolwe, which is the main link between the two districts is always cut off by floods,” he said.

Ms Madina Hifudde, another resident of Butaleja, said the affected families need urgent financial and moral support.

“We appeal to the government and other non-governmental organisations to intervene because the situation is bad,” Ms Hifudde said.

The chairperson-elect for Butaleja District, Mr Michael Higenyi Bory, said about 15,000 families have been affected by floods.

He said the crops destroyed include rice, sweet potatoes and cassava.

“We request the government to intervene and help our people. We need shelter and food,” he said.

The district environmental officer, Mr Tom Wandera, said the district is making an assessment report to submit to the Office of the Prime Minister for assistance to the affected families.

“We ask our people who are in flood-prone areas to relocate to safer places as we wait for any assistance from the government,” Mr Wandera said.

He said they have gazetted Doho Rice Scheme offices and some schools for people who have been displaced.

The Resident District Commissioner, Mr Stanly Bayole, said the government has the political will and it’s aware of the damage caused by floods.

Pupils in the Rwenzori Sub-region, whose classroom blocks and school buildings were swept off by floods in Kasese and Bundibugyo districts, can now smile again after they got new classroom blocks, pit-latrines and other facilities.

The pupils had lost any hope of resuming classes after the reopening of schools by the government.

At Bikone Primary School in Kasese District in May last year, all the classroom blocks were washed away by floods after River Mubuku burst its banks, leaving more than 500 learners stranded with nowhere to study from.

The floods from River Thaku also swept away classrooms at Kisabu Primary School also in Kasese District, leaving more than 300 pupils helpless.

Others affected by floods include Budenge and Bughonga primary schools in Bundibugyo District.

In Ntoroko District, floods from rising water levels of Lake Albert submerged all the classrooms at Umoja, Rwangara and Kachwakumu primary schools.

The new classroom blocks and other facilities were built by Save the Children, a non-governmental organisation.

The head teacher of Bikone Primary School, Mr Shem Tabura, said during lockdown in May last year, all classrooms and school records were destroyed by floods as River Mubuku burst its banks.

“We are now happy because we had lost hope for the future of our pupils as all the classroom blocks were swept away by floods. We did not have any records as text books, PLE result slips from 1989 to 2019, among others were destroyed. We are happy to see that our pupils have resumed school,” he said.

Mr Josephat Muhindo, the head teacher of Kisabu Primary School, said three classroom blocks were swept away by floods.

He said the school currently has 380 learners and have been struggling to accommodate more students.

“Our community members and other stakeholders raised about Shs12 million, which we used to buy land elsewhere to relocate the school because we were advised that where the school was located is not good, but now we have got four new classrooms and pupils are studying comfortably,” Mr Muhindo said.

He said last year in July, officials from the Office of Prime Minister promised to build seven classrooms but up to now they have not received any communication.

Mr Colenelius Masereke, a parent in Ibanda-Kyanya town council, said when floods swept away the school they lost hope about the future of their children to go back to school.

“Some people in the community died in floods and good enough it was lockdown. We did not lose any students. We are happy to see that we got new classrooms for our pupils. We shall wait for the government to make additional infrastructure,” he said.

Mr Muhindo Bagonza Libbum, the project manager of Enabling teacher approach at Save the Children, said with Shs291.4 million, they built four classrooms each at Kisabu and Bikone in Kasese District while in Bundibugyo District, they built latrines at Budenge and Bughonga primary schools.

He said they have also given the affected schools Wash facilities and SOPs, motorcycles, digital cameras, among others.

Floods

Kasese and Bundibugyo districts are prone to floods. In May 2020, rivers Mubuku and Nyamwaba burst their banks, causing floods which displaced many people and destroyed several property.

In Ntoroko District, floods displaced more than 10,000 people in Kanara Sub-county and up to now those displaced remain stranded.

7,7,FL-2019-000066-UGA,'No One Is Coming': Residents Face Devastation After Floods - Global Press Journal,https://globalpressjournal.com/africa/uganda/no-one-coming-residents-face-devastation-floods/,"KASESE, UGANDA — Around 1 a.m. on May 7, 2020, Lorna Bambu heard screams.

Frightened voices told her, her seven children and their neighbors to run. Heavy rains had soaked western Uganda’s mountainous Kasese region the day before, and now the area’s rivers had burst their banks. Torrents of water rushed into the valley, destroying homes, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure.

Bambu, 37, tried to escape. “I was stuck. The water was to my knees, and my hands held two of my youngest children,” she says. “We held onto whatever we could until help came in the morning.”

Bambu’s house was swept away in the flooding, but she and her children survived. Her husband was not so lucky. “My husband, who was at a bar when it happened, tried to get to us but was injured by a moving log,” she says. “As we could not get medical help in time, he died.”

The Kilembe Mines Hospital, the region’s primary medical center, which serves more than 20,000 residents, would normally have been accessible by an easy 15-minute walk. But the flooding destroyed the hospital and made area roads impassable, cutting off the region from other health care facilities.

Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda Water, rocks and mud swept through the Kilembe Mines Hospital and destroyed the medical center. Staff members were able to evacuate patients, and the hospital has reopened on a provisional basis at a new location.

The flooding affected more than 100,000 people in the region. At least 1,200 were left homeless and 18 were killed, says Godfrey Kabbyanga, mayor of the Kasese Municipal Council.

The dire situation is a consequence of environmental changes, as well as growing political and socioeconomic concerns. As a result, disasters like this are likely to become more common in the years ahead.

“In Kasese, rivers have been known to flood periodically since the 1940s,” says Evelyn Mugume, environment officer for the Kasese municipality. Climate change is causing snow in the mountains to melt, she says, increasing the frequency and severity of the flooding. Local residents also have been illegally building homes and farms along the banks of River Nyamwamba, one of the main rivers in the region, making the land too unstable to control the floodwaters.

“Areas along the riverbanks are supposed to be managed by government, but people have got to own plots there,” Mugume says. “They have degraded this land, because not all of them know how to manage it. Politicians use lip service to protect illegal occupants. They do not advocate enough for environment protection.”

The government has put forward plans to restore the riverbanks by constructing barriers to protect infrastructure and calling on residents to plant bamboo and reeds, which can help control erosion.

Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda Flooding from River Nyamwamba cut off one of the main roads in the Kasese area, affecting thousands of residents. Local officials are still assessing damage in the region and deciding how to proceed with reconstruction.

But Centenary Robert Franco, a member of Parliament who represents the Kasese municipality, says the responsibility for managing the land lies elsewhere.

“It’s not my duty to protect the environment – there are organizations for that,” he says. “We do not make these people stay on the land.”

Local residents say they are aware of efforts to restore the riverbanks, but the plans don’t put food on their tables, leaving them with no choice but to continue to build and farm along the river. “I cannot grow bamboo on the small land I have,” says Bera Edith, 36, a mother of five whose house was destroyed in mudslides last May.

Since the flooding, Bera, Bambu and approximately 900 other residents of the region have been living in tents and semipermanent houses in the Kibota Seventh Day Adventist Camp for internally displaced people.

Patricia Lindrio, GPJ Uganda The Kibota Seventh Day Adventist Camp houses approximately 900 people from the Kasese region. Conditions in the camp have been deteriorating, and residents have appealed to the government to provide better accommodations and sanitation.

Conditions in the camp are deteriorating, according to Sikabyahoro Jimmy, the camp’s chairman.

“Many have symptoms of typhoid and malaria, and there are no drugs in the nearest health center,” he says. He adds that aid workers at the camp have been overwhelmed and that the last delivery of supplies was in October.

“There is no food, the hospital is far,” he says. “We have called for help, but no one is coming.”

Centenary says the government is aware of conditions in the camp and is trying to get the displaced residents food and other necessities, and permanently resettle them in areas less prone to flooding. But finding available land to house them has proven challenging, and many Kasese residents say they would like to return to their original homes, despite the risk of flooding.

Kabbyanga, Kasese’s mayor, says local officials are still working to assess the damage to the area. For Bambu and other Kasese residents, however, rebuilding has become a way of life.

“The mountains do get angry, but sometimes you get a rainbow after the storm,” she says. “I just hope to never experience the rage of the rivers again. I pray that for my children as well.”","Tue, 26 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://globalpressjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GPJNews_Uganda_PL_Hospitalbridge_-34_web2048-650x434c.jpg,"['devastation', 'camp', 'rivers', 'coming', 'land', 'help', 'region', 'residents', 'kasese', 'floods', 'uganda', 'flooding', 'hospital', 'face']", 
8,8,FL-2019-000066-UGA,Uganda 'When It Rains … We Cry': River Submerges Livelihoods - Global Press Journal,https://globalpressjournal.com/africa/uganda/rains-cry-overflowing-river-submerges-livelihoods/,"ELEGU, UGANDA — It didn’t rain the day 2-year-old Raymond Giga was found submerged in water next to the bed he shared with his mother.

But the River Unyama still poured in from the east and swallowed him, says Raymond’s mother, Sylvia Gimono, her eyes wet with tears. Raymond was two weeks shy of celebrating his third birthday when he tumbled off the bed into water pooling on the floor. His mother, in a nearby room, didn’t hear a sound.

An hour after his sister found him, Raymond was pronounced dead.

Gimono, who runs a small motel in this burgeoning community on the border of Uganda and South Sudan, blames the flood for taking her child’s life and decimating her business. She moved to the northern town of Elegu to make a living off increased trade as both countries, after years of internal conflict, settled into periods of peace. But she encountered a new kind of threat.

The November flood, which left thousands homeless and ruined numerous operations like Gimono’s, wasn’t the first. Destructive floods have overwhelmed the area multiple times in recent years as increasingly heavy rains meet with the side effects of a swelling population, including uprooted trees along the river’s banks and the destruction of wetlands through farming. While some officials point to the ramifications of growth, residents accuse the government of failing to implement a long-promised flood mitigation plan that may have spared businesses and saved the lives of children like Raymond.

Nakisanze Segawa, GPJ Uganda Ugandans who live near the border with South Sudan chopped trees along the riverbank to make room for an increasing population. This has made it more difficult to prevent flooding.

Government officials “are not feeling the pitch of the suffering of the people,” says Michael Lakony, a chairperson of the district where Elegu is located, about 163 kilometers (101 miles) from the nearest big city, Gulu. “This is a known disaster and should be easy to deal with.”

The town sits in a low-lying area especially susceptible to floods. “When it rains in Gulu,” he says, “in Elegu we cry.”

Uganda is experiencing more frequent and fierce droughts and floods, according to a 2018 climate change profile by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Rainfall is expected to increase, particularly here in the country’s north, escalating the risk of natural disasters.

Floods killed seven people last year, displaced more than 4,000 community members, and ruined billions of Ugandan shillings’ worth of goods, including cement and maize, Lakony says. Gulu received more than 90 centimeters (35 inches) of rainfall from September to November, about double the usual average, according to data from the national weather agency.

Nakisanze Segawa, GPJ Uganda Elegu sits in a low-lying area susceptible to flooding. Residents say the government hasn’t done enough to address the increased risk.

The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives could have solved the flooding problem in 2018, Lakony says, when it signed a memorandum of understanding with TradeMark East Africa, a Nairobi-based nonprofit focused on trade, to implement a flood mitigation plan worth 1.8 billion shillings (about $490,000). The plan called for constructing a drainage system to contain the floods and creating channels 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from Elegu to divert the water.

The area, by that point, had grown from a scattering of grass-thatched homes to a substantial community with a tarmacked road, the groan of breaking trucks and the constant buzz of moving commerce.

The growth started in 2008, soon after the end of Uganda’s two-decade civil war, which displaced nearly 2 million residents and, according to some estimates, killed more than 100,000 people. Three years later, South Sudan gained independence from Sudan and officially became a country. And the village of Elegu became a town.

Elegu’s population has grown about 30 times since 2012, when it had 4,000 residents, Lakony says. But nothing has come of the flood plan.

Government officials disagree. Amelia Kyambadde, the minister for Trade, Industry and Cooperatives, says an initial evaluation showed the area was too swampy to implement the mitigation plan. Government engineers are aware of the situation, she says, and are working with TradeMark East Africa on an alternative solution. She declined to discuss the timeframe.

TradeMark East Africa didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Nakisanze Segawa, GPJ Uganda Elegu’s main road lacks a drainage system that would help ward against devastating floods.

Wilfred Baguma, a local councilman, says water overflow has been an issue since the 1970s. But increased rain and farming near the snaking Unyama riverbank have worsened the problem.

Low-lying areas like Elegu tend to flood because residents have chopped down the trees near and along the river that could have contained overflow, says Joshua Zaake, executive director of Environmental Alert, a nongovernmental organization based in Kampala.

Many who have benefitted from growth are now the ones suffering. Sarah Nakizza, a household goods trader at Elegu market, has lost products to the floods. When the water flows through the market at night, she says, most of her stored goods get swept away.

Ugandans in the region initially made money exporting food, water, soap, eggs and construction materials to the newly independent South Sudan. But Elegu quickly grew into a way station for people who desired goods from either side — cooking oil, sugar and tinned milk are cheaper in South Sudan, for example — and for traders in need of accommodation.

Trucks lining the main road have Kenyan, Tanzanian and Ugandan license plates. Vendors sell sliced pineapples along a street crammed with lodges and a boisterous market.

Some now fear the repercussions of that development. Residents like Gimono demand a clearer strategy to deal with the lack of drainage channels and other mitigation techniques. If for nothing else, she says, than for her son.

Otherwise, “next time it will be another woman’s child killed by floods.”

For most of that time, Uganda’s government has been trying to chase him away.

Now, it is the water itself that has driven him from his small house on the edge of Entebbe, a Ugandan town that juts into Africa’s largest lake.

Thousands have been displaced from their homes along the shoreline by the worst flooding since records began more than a century ago. Musasizi, who works as a truck driver, is renting a room on higher ground until the waters recede.

“Homes have been destroyed,” said Musasizi, whose family came here originally seeking cheap land. “My friends are now on the streets.”

The Ugandan government has said people like Musasizi are partly to blame for the floods, and wants them to leave the wetlands for good.

It plans to start evicting people without compensation this month - in the middle of a coronavirus lockdown that has hit the poor hardest.

‘RICH WILL REMAIN’

Alfred Okot Okidi, the top civil servant at the ministry of water and environment, said 700,000 Ugandans had been affected by flooding nationwide, almost all of whom live illegally in the protected zones around lakes and rivers.

Settlement, cultivation and industry were destroying the wetlands, which act as “natural sponges” to absorb excess rainfall, Okidi told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The evictions are in line with a directive issued by President Yoweri Museveni, who warned in an address last week that the floods “should be an eternal lesson to all of us”.

That is a message heard with scepticism in the swamps of Entebbe, where houses crumble into the water and men fish in flooded gardens.

Peter Kisakye Zzimula, the pastor of a church on the wetlands, argued that people only build there because they cannot afford to rent property elsewhere.

“Nobody would wish to be here but people are oppressed,” he said. “If you evict them, where will they go?”

The rains over east Africa have been unusually heavy since last year and climate scientists have predicted more such weather in future.

But the flooding is exacerbated by local factors including the destruction of forests and wetlands, said Frank Muramuzi, executive director of the National Association of Professional Environmentalists, a civil society group.

Muramuzi said wealthy investors were snapping up land to grow rice or flowers for sale, and set up hotels and resorts.

“All those establishments are being done by rich people and some them have connections in government,” he said.

“The poor people will be evicted, but the rich people will remain.”

‘GOD HAS COME’

Last year, wetlands covered just 8.4% of Uganda, down from 15.5% in 1994, according to the environment ministry.

In 2014 the government ordered the cancellation of all land titles there, issued illegally by local officials because the law prohibits private ownership of wetlands.

A subsequent survey of four central districts identified 1,700 titles in wetlands, said Collins Oloya, the acting director of environmental affairs at the environment ministry.

But the process has become bogged down in lengthy court proceedings and only 300 titles have so far been cancelled.

Now the rising waters are forcing people out of the wetlands, doing Oloya’s work for him.

“I’m very happy that God has come,” he said.

But the political pressures that have stymied past threats of eviction may do so again, with elections scheduled for next year.

Police fired teargas at protesting vendors last month as they shut down a flooded market on another stretch of shoreline.

“We need to conserve the environment, but at the same time we need to be conscious that we are dealing with human beings,” said Kayanja Vincent de Paul, the mayor of Entebbe.

“It is a hotcake. If you handle it badly, it can burn you up.”

SUSPICION

Tensions are heightened by popular suspicion. Musasizi, the truck driver, believes governments have engineered the floods to grab land from the poor.

“After this water has chased these poor people, more hotels are going to be built here,” he said.

Meanwhile Judith Amojong, another resident, is hoping for divine intervention.

She used to sleep in the local church with a few other homeless worshippers.

One day she foresaw a great flood. “I got a dream where the world was full of water,” she recalled.

Soon after, the waters started seeping under the corrugated iron walls, bringing coldness and snakes.

Amojong, who is now sheltering at the house of a fellow churchgoer, hopes that she will not have to return.

Heavy rainfalls experienced in the Eastern parts of Uganda in the months of May and June 2019 caused flooding and landside disasters within the Elgon region, directly affecting 569 households (2,845 individuals) in four districts of Bududa, Sironko, Mbale and Butaleja. The landslides in Bududa district caused six (6) deaths, and injuries to 27 persons who were all treated and recovered. Pease refer to the EPoA for details on impact per affected district.

As anticipated, an outbreak of cholera was later confirmed by the Ministry of Health in Bududa district two weeks after the launch of this DREF operation, which affected the same community affected by the landslides. A total of 72 cholera cases, with 3 deaths were recorded (Case Fatality Rate=4.17%). The operation therefore refocussed its strategy towards provision of safe water, improved sanitation, and hygiene behaviours among the affected and other at-risk communities in Bududa, Sironko, Butaleja and Mbale districts. The Ministry of Health later launched Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaign in Bududa where the operation supported with community mobilization that increased uptake of the vaccine among all at-risk individuals. All these efforts led to rapid interruption of the cholera outbreak spread in Bududa that prevented it from affecting other at-risk areas in neighbouring Manafwa, Namisindwa, Butaleja, Sironko, Mbale and Bulambuli districts.

On 20 June 2019, IFRC launched a DREF operation worth CHF 151,041 to support Uganda Red Cross Society respond to humanitarian needs of 2,845 people affected by landslides and floods disasters in Bududa, Mbale, Butaleja, and Sironko district.

In Kabale District (South-western Uganda), rain caused havoc, collapsing the main highway to Rwanda causing diversion of all traffic via Nyamitanga hills. The Office of the Prime Minister is providing in-kind food and NFI assistance; however further assistance is required. Moderate to heavy rain is forecast over most of South and East Uganda on 11-12 May. (ECHO, 11 May 2020)

At least eight people were feared dead yesterday after floods and mudslides hit parts of Kasese District on the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Traffic between Uganda and DRC was also cut off after the main bridge was submerged by River Thaku, which separates the two countries. River Thaku burst its banks at around 5am, forcing hundreds of residents to run for their lives. (Monitor, 22 May 2020)

The Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA) has warned that some parts of the country are likely to experience strong winds and hailstorms as the rainy season sets in.

The authority has asked Ugandans to take precaution because there will be cases of thunderstorm, lightning and hailstorms.

The alert issued by the authority in a tweet on Monday said: “Alert! The rains expected in most parts of the country are likely to be associated with medium to strong winds. Be sure to reinforce your roofs for living houses, granary stores, and others; if there is need. Keep safe.”

Dr Festus Luboyera, the UNMA executive director, said there is a high likelihood of having rains above normal levels in several parts of the country.

“The onset of seasonal rains is anticipated to be characterised by severe isolated lightning, thunder and hailstorms,” he warned.

He said the predicted rains forecast should be used for planning in all rain-fed economic activities so as to improve economic welfare and livelihoods for all communities in their localities.

“UNMA will continue to monitor the evolution of relevant weather systems, particularly the state of the Seas Surface Temperature and Indian Ocean Dipole, and issue appropriate rainfall alerts, updates and advisories to the users regularly, especially to those areas that have been heavily affected by floods and landslides disasters,” he added.

Dr Luboyera said the major physical conditions that are likely to influence the increased rainfall for the next three months in Uganda include the current and evolving Sea Surface Temperature anomalies over global oceans.

He specifically pointed out the increased probability for Neutral El Nino Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole through the months of March, April and May period.

Dr Luboyera said the expected rains in most parts of the country may, however, present good prospects for improved agricultural production.

“Farmers and other agricultural practitioners are highly encouraged to take advantage of the expected good rains to optimise food and crop production,” he said.

He also advised farmers to plant trees, restock livestock farms, fish ponds and apiaries.

Dr Luboyera warned that there will be floods in central Uganda and landslides in mountainous areas of Kigezi, Rwenzori and the Elgon regions. He also warned that there could be an invasion of locusts.

“The disaster risk management institutions should review their contingency plans,” he said.

He said areas expected to receive average to above average rainfall should undertake integrated flood management, flood preparedness and mitigation strategies in flood-prone areas and plans for optimisation of power generation and distribution should be enhanced due to the expected increased discharge of seasonal rain water into the water bodies.

He said the urban areas should prepare for the flash floods by clearing water and drainage channels.

“Urban authorities need to clear and reduce blockages of the drainage systems to avoid water logging on streets. Strong winds may be experienced, which can cause structural damages to buildings,” he said.

Impact on health

Dr Festus Luboyera, the UNMA executive director, said there is high risk of malaria in wetter areas of Teso, Lake Victoria basin, Lake Kyoga basin, lowlands adjacent to Elgon region, and risk of cholera is expected in Buliisa, Busia, South western, Bulambuli, Karamoja sub-region and Namayingo District.

“There is, therefore, need to conduct community awareness about the potential outbreak of the diseases in context and surveillance,” he said.

Then came the alarms raised by those living in the hilltop areas, those who could run, racing down to warn people along the valley and lowlands to run. A torrent of water was on its way down the mountain. Four rivers in Kasese district – the Nyamwamba, Mubuku, Nyamughasana and Lhubiriha – had burst their banks.

“I realised a disaster was coming. It was a matter of life and death,” Masika, 34, tells the Guardian. “I ran back to the house to wake up my husband and children. I knocked and alerted our neighbours. The floods and stones are coming to kill us,” she says.

That night heavy rains in the area of western Uganda swept away homes, schools, submerged farms, cut off bridges and left several roads inaccessible, affecting 24,760 houses and an estimated 173,000 people, according to a disaster committee interim assessment report.

“We couldn’t sleep on the hill. It was so cold. The children were crying. There was nothing I could do,” says Masika as she lights a fire to cook at a makeshift home in Kilembe, about 10km north-west of Kasese town.

“We came back in the afternoon after the water had receded and saw the great devastation of the floods. The water destroyed and swept away everything,” she says. “We have been left homeless and very desperate. Where do we start from? We need urgent assistance.”

A few kilometres down the road of this tourist region, Philly Donald Baluku, a travel guide, said the impact was a disaster. “I have been working as a tour guide on a contract basis. The tourism sector closed because of Covid-19 restrictions. The floods have rendered me homeless now,” says Baluku.

“What do I do? I have nine dependents. My brother has offered us a single room to stay. But we don’t have bedding and food. We are living in a very hopeless and desperate situation.

“All my property, banana plantations, vanilla and crops which I was supposed to harvest in September were swept away.”

The floodwater destroyed the Nyamwamba hydroelectric power station, and overran the wards, mortuary and drug stores of Kilembe Mines hospital.

The villages of Kyanjuki, Bulembia and Katiri are now buried under mud and huge stones that were propelled down the mountain. Homes on lower land are submerged in water.

“I haven’t seen anything like this. I’m seeing for the first time where everything has been run down,” says Stephen Oluka, the director of Uganda’s National Emergency Coordination and Operations Centre, on a visit to Kasese town.

“The infrastructure has been damaged. The hospital and power station has been overrun. People’s houses along the path have all been swept away. Gardens, crops and cows have been taken away,” he says.

Buildings damaged by the flooding at Kilembe

Schools and churches have been designated temporary displacement camps.

“The living conditions are bad and alarming. The basic facilities are lacking,” says Catherine Kugoza, 37, a mother of six, sheltering in Karusandara church, about 20km south of Kasese.

“We are starving. People are taking dirty water from the stream. The one latrine is full. People are defecating in the open. This is a recipe for disease outbreaks like cholera and dysentery.”

When the Guardian visited Karusandara on Saturday, the camp was hosting more than 1,000 people, mostly women and children, with just 18 tents supplied by Save the Children.

“It’s a crisis situation. We have children in the camps. They don’t have blankets, they need mosquito nets, people don’t have food,” says Robert Centenary, a lawmaker for Kasese municipality. “People don’t have supplies for purifying water; they don’t have utensils to use in the camps. The situation has caused an appalling sanitation crisis. We may end up degenerating into a cholera outbreak.

“We really need a lot of water and sanitation support. We want the government to immediately come to the rescue of the people.”

The Uganda Red Cross Society says the immediate needs include shelter, food, bedding, mosquito nets, utensils, mobile toilets, water storage facilities and tarpaulins. It is appealing for more resources.

Oluka says overcrowding in makeshift centres had complicated efforts to combat Covid-19. “The guidelines have been compromised. I didn’t see anyone [displaced] in the camps with a mask. The leaders are telling people to maintain social distancing but it’s not attainable. There is overcrowding in camps.”

He adds: “I don’t think they are now bothered about coronavirus, which they haven’t seen. They are bothered about what has affected them now [floodings], safety from waters and their livelihoods.”

In its outlook for March to May, Uganda’s National Meteorological Authority warned of heavy rainfall over several parts of the country, which could lead to flooding and landslides, causing loss of lives, destruction of property and infrastructure.

Floods and landslides have killed 194 people in neighbouring Kenya and 65 in north-west Rwanda in the past week. On Sunday morning, there was another wave of flash floods in Uganda.

“We have looked at the magnitude of the problem. It is too huge. It requires immediate, medium and long-term interventions,” says Oluka.

“The government will look at shifting people from the dangerous areas in Rwenzori to safer areas when funds can allow.”","Sat, 16 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0803ed7e04441b3c3d6a2fbe25ce39c551c25eca/0_213_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f0e80dd557c32da16eab8c1bc615cca4,"['slides', 'water', 'children', 'dont', 'kasese', 'away', 'devastate', 'floods', 'uganda', 'western', 'run', 'masika', 'need', 'desperate', 'swept', 'rock']",

I had a lot of hope to see the pigs change my situation in the long run,” he said.

Simon Kotol, the vice-chairman LC1 of Kangole chini told URN that many birds have been washed away by running water. He said the floods would worsen already starving families who have been facing a big challenge to afford food. “We have been receiving rains but this is too much and abnormal am sure many families are going to be affected,” he said.

By Justus Wanzala

BUDALANGI, Kenya, Aug 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Women dashed around open kitchens dotted across the playground of Bubango Primary School, preparing to feed the hundreds of children who now call the school in western Kenya their home.

About 400 families from Budalangi, in Busia County, have been living at the school since April, when the Nzoia River that flows from Kenya's western highlands into Lake Victoria burst its banks in the worst flooding the area has seen in decades.

After more than a year of unusually heavy rainfall, over 800,000 Kenyans have been displaced by flooding, according to the government.

The situation has been made worse by flooded rivers channelling huge volumes of water into Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake, causing it to spill over onto its shores - a phenomenon called ""backflow"".

""We lost everything when our homes got inundated with water. Houses have been destroyed, livestock and crops swept away,"" said Hesborne Opondo, 45, who lost his shop to the rising lake.

His wife now sells flatbread to others living at Bubango school to support their six children, he added.

Scientists warn that other massive flood events may be ahead as climate change strengthens, and some have urged the three countries that share the lake - Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania - to work together to put systems in place to lessen flood damage.

""There should be a joint effort in dealing with disaster management and preparedness in the lake region,"" said Alfred Owuor Opere, a climate and water expert at the University of Nairobi.

Management of the dams that regulate the flow of water into Lake Victoria should especially be a regional concern, as the area is expected to receive enhanced rainfall in future, he added.

While Budalangi is no stranger to flooding, in recent years the damage has been limited by two dykes the government built 20 years ago along the Nzoia River and on the southern shore of Lake Victoria, according to local elders.

But this year, the dykes could not contain the flooding - the most severe the area has seen since the 1960s, say experts, who attribute it to a combination of climate change and the erosion of shores by urbanisation and farming.

A year of extraordinarily heavy rains, which started in April 2019 following a drought, pushed the lake's water level up to 13.4 metres (44 feet) in May, breaking the previous 1964 record, according to the Lake Victoria Basin Commission.

In normal years, the lake has an average level of 12 metres.

While the waters that burst from the Nzoia have started to recede, the backflow from the lake is still flooding surrounding areas, residents said.

DAM DIPLOMACY

With climate change likely a major contributor to the recent flooding, the nations around Lake Victoria must work together to tackle the problem, said Joseph Awange, a professor of earth sciences at Curtin University in the Australian city of Perth.

""Engineering measures such as damming and planting trees to regulate the use of water could be considered,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email interview.

Uganda, where Lake Victoria feeds into the Nile River, is seen as a key player in preventing flooding in the region, he noted.

Since its construction in 1954, Uganda's Nalubaale dam has controlled the flow of water out of Lake Victoria into the Nile, in line with a treaty between Uganda and Egypt, he explained.

If the water in the dam rises above a certain level, Uganda must release some to maintain the natural flow of the Nile.

Leaders in western Kenya have accused Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni of not doing enough to control backflow.

In June, Raphael Wanjala, a member of parliament for Budalangi, called on the East African Legislative Assembly to intervene and urged Museveni to complete the ongoing construction of another dam along the Nile.

But Sam Cheptoris, Uganda's environment minister, told media in May that the rapid rise of Lake Victoria was due to a mix of environmental degradation, poor land use practices and urbanisation that has stopped the ground absorbing rainfall.

These factors resulted in the ""speedy movement of water into the lakes and rivers"" feeding into Lake Victoria, he said.

SILTED RIVERS

George William Omony, a senior meteorologist at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority, said that above-average rainfall plays a major role in causing backflow but the phenomenon has been amplified by human activities.

He pointed to the growing number of villages and farms on Lake Victoria's shores, which are protected areas where human settlement and farming is prohibited.

When forests along the rivers that feed into the lake are cleared for farming, they lose trees whose roots hold onto soil and minimise the amount of mud and silt that end up in rivers.

When rivers become silted, they can hold less water before overflowing or pushing it back into the lake, he explained.

He and other climate experts said the recent extreme flooding is linked to a cyclical process of drought and heavy rainfall that happens in the Lake Victoria area every 50 years or so.

""While it is difficult to tell when the cycle will repeat, the chances of it happening again are high,"" Omony added.

BENEFITING COMMUNITIES

Opere, at the University of Nairobi, said Lake Victoria communities and the government could also work together to reduce the risk of backflow and flooding.

He suggested planting trees along rivers and building channels to carry floodwater away from the lake and into water pans and reservoirs to use for livestock and irrigation.

He also stressed the importance of dams in regulating the amount of water flowing into Lake Victoria.

Plans by Kenya's government to build major dams to curb flooding along the Nyando, Nzoia and Yala rivers - the first of which is due to start construction on the Nyando in September - will help protect and support local communities, he added.

Government officials have said residents will be allowed to fish in the water behind the dams and use it for domestic and agricultural purposes.

""The dams will have a huge impact in reducing this flooding menace around the lake while providing economic opportunities for people living in these areas,"" Opere said.

Hundreds of people have been killed by floodwaters in Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Rwanda and Ethiopia which have also displaced hundreds of thousands across the region.

Heavy overnight rains flooded areas around Mountain Rwenzori in Western Uganda after the River Nyamwamba burst its banks, forcing people to seek refuge in nearby schools and destroying roads and bridges, a senior government official said.

“What complicates the matter is that this is the era of COVID. People are expected to maintain social distance but how do you maintain distance in such a situation?” Julius Mucunguzi, spokesman for the prime minister’s office, said by telephone.

One of the hospitals in the area, Kilembe, was also overrun by the gushing waters despite being built on a raised bank and reinforced with sandbags.

“There are wards which were completely washed away. The mortuary was swept away. You wouldn’t know that once upon a time there was a mortuary there. The drugs and drug stores were washed away,” Mucunguzi said.

In Ethiopia, the Somali region in the east of the country has borne the brunt of the floods, which have displaced more than 100,000 people, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

In neighbouring Somalia, an unspecified number of people were killed when floods washed away an entire small town in the semi-autonomous Puntland region, officials said.

The heavy rains stem from moisture dumped in the region by winds coming in from the Indian Ocean where temperatures have risen in recent months, Chris Shisanya, a professor of climatology at Nairobi-based Kenyatta University, said.

“This is a carry-over of what we had last year,” he said, referring to floods and landslides in the region.

Nearly 200 people in Kenya have been killed by the floods, which have also displaced 100,000 more.

“This is compounding the COVID-19 response,” Kenya Health Ministry Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman told a news conference.

“The displaced people have been forced to congregate in makeshift camps with the risk of banding together exposing them to the possibility of contracting the virus.”

“As members of from sugar growing areas, we would like to register our dismay at the casual nature in which the trade ministry has continued to handle an issue that has potential of destroying the livelihoods of eight million Kenyans who depend on the industry,” Koyoo said.

“While the Agriculture Committee investigating the circumstances under which 10 companies belonging to two individuals imported 47,000 metric tons without the prerequisite pre-shipment inspection from the Sugar Directorate, the same Trade ministry which has been mentioned as having overstepped mandate has gone ahead to sign a communiqué’, a clear affront to Parliament and its institutions.”

Okelo said they will not allow a grain of the imported sugar to enter into the country and flood the market linking the importation deal to the coming 2022 elections campaign funding.

“Towards elections, things like sugar importation and hike in fuel prices become common since sugar barons and cartels are trying to raise money for campaigns,” Okelo said.

Odege said Uganda has no advantage over Kenya in terms of sugar production faulting the government for doing little to revive the country’s sugar sector.

“This will open floodgates for other people to import sugar from other countries through Uganda and the net effect is that all our factories will die,” Naicca said.

More than 20 people have been killed as a result of floods and mudslides in the last week in Uganda. The eastern parts of the country have also been suffering floods and landslides around the Mount Elgon region.

In a statement on Friday, Musa Ecweru, Uganda’s minister of state for disaster preparedness, said: “Four people were killed in Bududa district and another four including two children in Sironko district.”

“Over 10,000 people have been displaced in eastern Uganda alone and we are currently reviewing villages’ household registers to establish the number and names of missing persons,” Ecweru said.

The government has now released more than $5.4m for emergency procurement.

These include inflatable boats, tarpaulins, blankets, relief food, drugs for water-borne diseases and culverts for fixing washed away bridges.

The extreme weather has been blamed on the Indian Ocean Dipole – a climate system defined by the difference in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the ocean.

At the moment, the ocean around East Africa is far warmer than usual, resulting in higher evaporation and moist air flowing inwards over the continent as rain: the hallmarks of a “positive” dipole.

Scientists warn that as ocean temperatures rise because of climate change, Indian Ocean dipoles will become more frequent and severe.","Sun, 08 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/a9da3b70ff634047847981db622f315d_18.jpeg?fit=998%2C562,"['team', 'red', 'dozen', 'landslides', 'cross', 'kills', 'parts', 'bodies', 'country', 'uganda', 'western', 'flooding', 'bundibugyo', 'ocean']",

Description of the disaster

On 12 December 2019, Uganda Red Cross Society (URCS) with support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), launched a DREF operation in response to landslide events which occurred following prolonged rainfall from 29 November and 3 December 2019 the districts of Mbale and Bududa in Eastern Region of Uganda. These landslides affected 380 households (1,900 people). These landslides occurred in the broader context of extensive flooding across the whole of Uganda, which started in October and continued throughout December 2019.

During the assessments, URCS working with government (district and National teams such as the DDMCs) rescued and provided temporary shelters as well as psychosocial support to the affected and most vulnerable persons using resources at hand. Indeed, within the same period, Uganda had experienced another major flood and landslide in the Western region of Bundibugyo with 4,436HH 30,919 individuals (14,873Males and 16,046 Females) affected with 2,450 of those displaced and living in the two camps of Simuliki and Bubukwanga camps. As such, the NS extended the scope of the response to provide WASH assistance to the families affected in this district, which allowed URCS to reach 37,603 people (approx. 7,520 HH) through this DREF operation.","Mon, 01 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1557671-Uganda%20-%20Landslides%20Final%20Report%20-%20DREF%20Operation%20MDRUG043.png?itok=KKz80Nxs,"['mdrug043', 'landslides', 'urcs', 'red', 'final', 'operation', 'report', 'support', 'dref', 'response', 'region', 'occurred', 'affected', 'uganda']",

A week of heavy rains caused floods and mudslides in Eastern Uganda’s Bugisu and Bundibugyo regions near Rwenzori Mountain.



Authorities say the flooding has taken a toll with the loss of life and property, and with thousands more left stranded.



The Ugandan Red Cross’s Irene Nakasita says search and rescue operations in the regions are hampered as most roads have been washed away.



“And the decision has been taken to put up a transit shelter until the situation normalizes. So, most likely Bubukwang transit center is going to house close to 700 people who are displaced in Bundibugyo,” she said.



Meanwhile, Uganda’s State Minister for Disaster Preparedness and Relief Musa Ecweru says there are concerns about water-borne disease outbreaks in flood-affected areas.



“Now, there’s a risk of contamination of water and if that is not handled well, then we are going to risk another phase of a challenge, an outbreak of cholera which will compound our humanitarian intervention,” he said.



Ecweru says the government has released $5.4 million for emergency drugs to treat water-borne diseases, inflatable boats, tarps, blankets, food, and repairing bridges.



Ugandan authorities say the flooding is expected to recede in January as the weather improves.



Scientists have long warned that rising ocean temperatures are making seasonal rains more severe and more frequent.



The United Nation’s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) last week (Dec 4) said unusually heavy rainfall and flooding in East Africa has affected over 2.8 million people and left at least 280 dead.

UNOCHA said the unusually heavy rainfall was driven by the differences in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the Indian Ocean.

The UN office said rains were expected to diminish in the weeks ahead but heavy rains would likely persist into December and intensify in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

As the world battles a pandemic, large swaths of the African continent have been —literally — submerged by floods.

Since March, this crisis has left more than 400 people dead in East Africa. A separate round of flooding has hit West Africa’s Sahel region.

In Uganda, Catholic Relief services estimates that as many as 580,000 people are affected.

Country director Niek de Goeij says ""It's kind of affecting all kinds of people. You know, in Kampala, our capital city, it affects people who have nice houses on the lakeshore. But if you are in the Mount Elgon area, on the border with Kenya; or you're in the Kasese area, on the border with the D.R. Congo, and you’re a smallholder farmer normally benefits from farming on a river bank. And suddenly there’s this raging flash floods that comes down to hills and mountains because of this very intense rainfall — you know, you lose everything. You lose your house, you lose your land. And so it's a very diverse group of people that is affected.”

In the eastern town of Jinja, along the shores of Lake Victoria, radio host and environmental activist John Hillary says flooding doesn’t just destroy homes it ruins the very fabric that holds society together.

“The public hospital, the only public hospital in the Chilembwe region, was completely destroyed. So people as a result of the floods got sick. But they could not get anywhere else to go to because the hospital had been destroyed,” he said.

De Goeij says heavy rainfall is normal in East Africa — what isn’t, he says, is their frequency and intensity. And, he says, the pandemic makes it harder for groups like his to respond.

“It's like a triple crisis in Uganda, right? We have the locusts, we have all the floods. And then, on top of everything else, we have COVID-19. And so it's been, for the affected people, it’s been an especially hard year, you know, to be on a lockdown and be affected by floods, and then because of the lockdown, accessing the support and the relief that that they're entitled to,” he said.

Hillary, who speaks often about climate change on his radio show, says that to him and other activists, this is personal.

“My mom is a gardener. My grandparents, and many people in my family, are farmers. That's what I've known,"" he said. ""Growing up, I always went with my mom to the garden to dig, and we ate food from the gardens. Over time, we have noticed that, because of what I think is negligence, we have been involved in practices that have completely destroyed our rain cycle, our climate is deteriorating every other day. I'm only 26. I have seen over time my world deteriorating. I don't want to see the same for my children.”

This, he says, is a living nightmare. This is his home, and he wants future generations to see its beauty, too.","Tue, 13 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/kaltura-video-thumbs/1_z/1_zr629y9g.jpg,"['africa', 'large', 'lose', 'rainfall', 'youre', 'relief', 'east', 'widespread', 'know', 'destroyed', 'devastate', 'floods', 'uganda', 'world', 'hospital', 'sections']", 
26,26,FL-2019-000066-UGA,Lake Victoria Breathes Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic: Recaptures Its Tributaries - Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/lake-victoria-breathes-amidst-covid-19-pandemic-recaptures-its-tributaries,"The intensive and prolonged rainfall in Uganda and East African region has caused a rise in water levels of Lake Victoria and all major water bodies in the country.

Recognizing that many parts of Uganda including Lake Victoria received above normal rainfall between mid- April to late June, 2020, water levels have risen further resulting in floods with severe effects around the country.

At Ggaba landing site located North of Lake Victoria and Port Bell, a small industrial Centre in the South of the Lake, life and settlement has been disrupted by the flooding water that has submerged the areas.

Places such as Ggaba and Port Bell markets have all been submerged by water and traders have resorted to selling food and other items on the road that leads to the markets. Similarly, happening places such as Ggaba Beach, K.K Beach, Miami Beach have been swallowed by water. Others that have been affected are Ggaba Water Works offices, Serena- Kigo Hotel, Speke Resort Hotel- Munyonyo, and several others surrounding the great water body.

The question on most people’s minds when they see a flooded market, homes and businesses on the shores of Lake Victoria is whether the beaches, landing sites, and some islands they have known all their life will resurface.

Standing at the flooded part of Ggaba landing site is Kassim Katende, the chairperson of the fishermen at Ggaba.

“Most of the community members here depend on fishing, but right now we do not have fish because the lake is full of water and security forces are guarding the waters,” lamented Katende.

Sarah Kaine, a businesswoman who sells food items at Gaba, expresses her fears for the dying business because of the flooding of the area.

""Our customers have disappeared and we are worried that we may not be able to continue with our business again. My selling point has been flooded and I have no other option but to wait until it dries up,” narrates Kaine in agony.

Mzee Sulaiman Kassujja a trader dealing in fish selling at the same landing site for the past 25 years narrates that, “we who sell fish are affected so much because fishermen no longer catch good fish and in large quantities. The few fish caught are very expensive.”

According to Sulaiman, the rise in the price of the fish has made their customers to opt for other substitutes such as meat and chicken. He further noted that the rise is also as a result of the challenge in accessing the catch from the lake and increase in costs as a result of lockdown.

Currently, a big tilapia goes for UGX 35,000 ($9.21), up from UGX 20,000 ($5.26), an initial price before the disaster outbreak.

Hamis Gamwero, the LC1 for Ggaba landing site and has lived in Ggaba for four decades said, “Since I came here in 1986, I have never seen this kind of flood. The people, especially traders are at a high risk of contracting other diseases, and it is worse that we have coronavirus.”

Kamadha Kakooza, the Katoogo Village, chairperson, told us that at least 500 families have already left the place and hundreds, which have been rendered homeless, have been accommodated in other peoples’ homes that are yet to be invaded by the overflowing water.

“When the water levels started rising, those who could, chose to vacate the area. Some [who had nowhere to go] remained. What we did was to talk to those who are yet to be affected to at least accommodate those affected for some time,” he said.

Meanwhile, at Port Bell in Luzira, which is also a rail link and a railroad ferry wharf used for International traffic across Lake Victoria to Tanzania and Kenya, the story is not different. The water has entered into houses of the dwellers and forced them to seek refuge somewhere else.

“People are trying to desilt the water by pouring sand but the environment authorities are against it,” said Teopista Nankinga, a women’s leader at Port Bell.

Markets and settlements near the Lake have severely been affected and homes submerged by the flooding water. The disaster has also been recorded at the same time when the country is under lockdown in March because of COVID-19. This means that the affected people are left with a few options for survival since most of them could not travel to their villages.

Many of these businesses and government installations were located outside the 200 perimeter buffer zone recommended by the government. Their destruction raises tough questions about the level of government planning. If the 200 meter perimeter buffer zone recommended by the government is not safe, what is safe? Suppose businesses move farther away from the expanded lake shore, what happens when the lake shore eventually recedes?

The continued downpour and flooding has had negative impacts on the people and property downstream of Lake Victoria during the time when the country and region at large is on a lockdown, as a means of controlling the potential spread of coronavirus.

Environment experts warn that the flooding of the lake tributaries has been accelerated by environmental degradation, which has caused a disruption of the water bodies.

Dr. Daniel Babikwa, the District Support Coordinator at the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), said that the communities encroached on the shores of the Lake, thus disturbing nature.

“Unfortunately, many people encroached on the shoreline and what you see now are the results of the impact,” said Babikwa.

On the same note, Beatrice Anywar, the Uganda State Minister for Environment, told us that most of the structures including Beaches set up around the Lake were illegal.

The Minister revealed that the government is encouraging voluntary migration of the settlement away from the endangered zones of the lake shores, and warned that action will be taken against those who will not leave.

In the same call, Dr. Tom Okurut, the Executive Director for NEMA, advises the affected residents to vacate the natural habitats lest they will be forcefully evicted.

A statement issued by the Ministry of Water and Environment on 1st May, stated that the Lake Victoria water level continues to rise to critical levels despite increased releases due to the increasing inflows and heavy rains in Lake Victoria Basin. At the same time, the Rivers discharging into Lake Victoria from upstream countries have uncontrollably more than doubled their inflows.

The current water levels that started last October (2019), have consistently continued to rise up from 12:00 meters to the current 13:32 meters, the second highest increase recorded since 1964, when the water level rose to 13:46 meters.

What Caused the Rise of Water Level?

Sam Cheptoris, Uganda’s Minister for Water and Environment, explained that Lake Victoria has over 23 rivers flowing into it from the three East African Countries that include Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

According to the Minister, when it rains, an increase in the waters from those rivers results into the direct increase in the water they pour into the largest freshwater lake in the continent.

“Some of these rivers originate from as far as Rwanda and Burundi: therefore, when it rains in those countries, water finds its ways into Lake Victoria,” explained the Minister.

Mr Cheptoris further noted that, “a number of areas around lakes and rivers have been identified as high flood risk areas and essential features such as schools, health facilities and places of worship are at risk.”

Is the Government Taking Any Measures?

In a communication by Minister Cheptoris, the government has put into place a number of measures to help address the problems of the rising water levels and associated floods.

Government has since instituted measures to immediately get water out of Lave Victoria through increased releases at Jinja which is now at the rate of 2200 cubic meters per second, up from the rate of 1000 cubic meters per second in October 2019.

A national Response team comprising the Ministry of Works and Transport, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, Ministry of Defense and Veteran Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries and, Ministry of Water and Environment. The team has ready equipment and Machinery to carry out surveillance and monitoring of the movement of the floating islands and removed those that are considered a threat to the electricity power generation.

The Inter-Ministerial committee has also been set up, under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister, comprising 14 Ministries and seven Agencies to implement Government response to the disaster.

In line to that, a multi-sectoral Technical Task team chaired by the Ministry of Water and Environment provides support to the Inter-Ministerial Committee and has already started on emergency works on: ensuring safety of Hydropower dams, protection of lives and, monitoring and surveillance of water resources and floating islands.

At the time of compiling this report, the lockdown in the country was preventing people from using public means of transport, some businesses such as salons, bars and open access markets were restricted from operation- and potentially putting the survival of the affected people at stake.

Although the number of COVID-19 infections have reached more than 1000, Uganda has continued to register almost 100% recoveries by July, 2020.

Lake Victoria which is shared by three countries; Tanzania (49%), Uganda (45%), and Kenya (6%), hit 1,134.38 metres above mean sea level (mamsl) on May 07. That is a difference of about 1.32 meters and is significant because Lake Victoria is a very shallow lake, especially on the Ugandan side where it averages a depth of just 40 meters.

Lake Victoria lies on an average elevation of 3,720 feet (1,134 meters) above sea level. Kampala is just 1,200 meters above sea level, a difference of about 70 meters. Ggaba, which is 60 meters above at 1,140 meters above sea level, is already inundated.

If the current rate of rise in water levels were to continue, the State House in Entebbe, and Parliament of Uganda in Kampala itself could easily find itself submerged.

Last Monday, Water and Environment was one of the ministries that presented their performance in the implementation of the 2016 NRM manifesto.

The ministry’s director for water resources management, Dr Florence Grace Odongo, revealed that the water levels on Lake Victoria have risen to 13.4 metres short of 8cm to reach last year’s levels and yet the rainy season has just started. People living on river banks and lake shores were, therefore, warned to vacate the areas before floods begin to rage.

Such warnings have become an annual repetition albeit in good faith as they are meant to avoid loss of lives and property.

Unfortunately, they are usually taken lightly by the audience for whom they are intended.

But then again, these people rightly referred to as encroachers would not even be there in the first place if environment laws were observed. Clearly, there seems to a problem when it comes to implementation of laws.

In a Daily Monitor story of May 14 titled, “Govt issues flood alerts, tells lakeside residents to vacate”, Mr Sam Cheptoris, the minister of Water and Environment, says one of the reasons they have not been able to contain encroachment and destruction of forests and wetlands is because of low enforcement of laws which is exacerbated by the fact that there are few enforcement officers under the environment protection police unit.

In a statement on the rising water levels of Lake Victoria and the Nile system last year in May, Mr Cheptoris directed that people living within the protection zones of wetlands, lakes, rivers, and forest reserves vacate with immediate effect.

He said the ministry was working with the Ministry of Local Government and other government agencies to evict people living within 100 metres of river banks, 30 metres of wetlands and 200 metres of lake shores, and in forest reserves.

He said the respective government offices, from the central to local levels, up to the sub-county and parish levels, has been informed about the directive and requested to take the required actions with immediate effect.

Was there an attempt to implement these directives in spite of the shortage of enforcement officers? What action is being taken against encroachers and how is government making sure that they do not settle in those areas again? How can the communities near the said areas be involved in stopping encroachment?

It would be prudent to present an audit of whether these directives were successfully implemented and if not, what can be done this time to get a better results.

This way, we can avoid repetitions of the same directives year after year with no lasting solutions.

HOIMA- As the country gears up for the reopening of schools for finalists, pupils of Primary Seven at Toonya Primary School in Buseruka sub-county, Hoima district, remain in uncertainty after their school was cut off by floods from Lake Albert.

The floods, which began in early April, have moved inland by over a kilometre from the shore, paralysing the activities of the fishing community on several landing sites.Henry Katalibabo, the Toonya A LCI chairperson, told New Vision that 222 houses, accommodating 1,068 people, have been affecteVd.

""The water levels keep rising. We are worried of the likely destruction of our homes,"" he said. Katalibabo said some pupils will be required to board canoes twice before accessing the area designated to accommodate them.

Moses Kyaligonza, the Toonya Primary School headteacher, said when schools were closed in March, they had 450 pupils with 38 in Primary Seven. Kyaligonza said it would be better to have these children accommodated in one place for their safety because trekking daily from their homes is risky.

Accommodation for teachers is also a big challenge because the flooded school had eight staff quarters. The houses that would have been rented by the teachers have also been affected by floods.

Dr Fredrick Byenume, the Hoima district health inspector, said waterborne diseases such as cholera and dysentery are likely to result from the floods.

""There is no doubt that the water is contaminated with faecal matter because all the pit latrines are filled up by water,"" Byenume said. He said they are planning to distribute chlorine tablets to purify the water as one way of preventing waterborne diseases.Byenume appealed to the public to desist from open defecation to avoid further contamination of the water.He said both the school and Toonya Health Centre III have been declared unfit for human use.

Uganda is known as the “Pearl of Africa” because of its stunning natural beauty and biodiversity. Its lush vegetation is associated with regular tropical rainfall, but the East African nation is now struggling to deal with more frequent and intense rains that are causing landslides.

Landslides can dump millions of tons of muddy debris in Uganda’s rivers and streams, said Mary Goretti Kitutu, Uganda’s minister of energy and mineral development and an expert on geology and landslides. Such debris can dam rivers, flood surrounding areas, and cause damage to infrastructure.

“The main landslide types [in Uganda] are debris slumps, which occur on concave slopes where water concentrates. Slopes facing northeast are most prone to landslides, which coincide with the dominant rainfall direction,” Kitutu said.

The region’s soil profile is significant, she continued, explaining that “topsoils have a high infiltration rate, which allows fast flow of water into the deeper, clay-rich horizons—promoting water stagnation and causing slope failure.”

Landslide Losses

Although Uganda has always experienced some loss of life due to landslides, the number of casualties has increased this century.

Over the past 25 years, catastrophic landslides have regularly hit the foothills of Mount Elgon, for instance, which straddles the border between eastern Uganda and Kenya. The region’s most devastating landslide swept the slopes in 2010. Although more than 300 people are thought to have perished, only about 100 bodies were recovered. Thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed.

In 2012, a landslide followed 2 days of heavy rains in the same area. At least 18 people were killed, and 15 houses were destroyed. In December 2019, five people died in mudslides following heavy rainfall, 150 houses were destroyed, and the crops of smallholder farmers were swept away.

The most obvious trigger for Uganda’s slump landslides is rainfall. Rainfall events of low intensity but long duration are thought to be the most disastrous, a pattern that is well known among Ugandan farmers.

Callist Tindimugaya, commissioner for water resources planning and regulation in Uganda’s Ministry of Water and Environment, attributed the increase in rainfall to changing climate patterns and rapid loss of forest cover due to trees being cut down to be used as fuel. Tindimugaya said climate change is likely to increase average temperatures in Uganda by up to 1.5°C in the next 20 years and by up to 4.3°C by the 2080s.

“Changes in rainfall patterns and total annual rainfall amounts are also expected,” he added, “but these are less certain than changes in temperature.”

“Rain Has Become My Enemy”

“Rain has become my enemy. When it rains, my heart sinks.” “Rain has become my enemy. When it rains, my heart sinks,” said Gerald Masaba, a coffee farmer in the Bududa District in eastern Uganda.

Masaba said many forests in the area have been turned into farms. The thin topsoil of converted forest often fails to retain water during heavy downpours, increasing the farm’s vulnerability to flood. In addition, terraced agriculture is not popular among farmers “because they believe terraces promote water infiltration, which triggers landslides,” Kitutu added.

Clovis Kabaseke, however, said farmers can be trained on how to successfully engage in terraced agriculture. Kabaseke is a lecturer and researcher in the School of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences at Mountains of the Moon University in Uganda.

Kabaseke said the agricultural method can be effective in maximizing arable land area in variable terrains and reducing soil erosion and water loss, but farmers need to be taught the most effective practices.

Displaced Communities

Alfred Okidi, the permanent secretary in Uganda’s Ministry of Water and Environment, said that in 2020, more than 850 people were permanently displaced by mudslides.

With assistance from partners such as the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Ugandan government was able to safely relocate these displaced people. Okidi said IOM and CERF provided $818,000 in emergency relief.

Musa Ecweru, the state minister for relief and disaster preparedness in the Ugandan cabinet, was hopeful that the relocation would ultimately help build communities and economies. “The landslide victims were settled in Kiryandongo District,” he said, “where each household was given land to farm so that they can move on with their new lives.”

Rosemary Nandudu, however, says the transition will not be easy. Nandudu was relocated from the wet, fertile ecosystem of eastern Uganda to the drier one of the western Kiryandongo District and said the land provided by the government is not fertile. “It has been hard for us to adjust to a dry land, when most crops we used to know and grow cannot grow there,” she said.

Margaret Kemigisa, who grows tea in the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains in western Uganda, said farmers who formerly grew crops such as beans, millet, and bananas have switched to tea. Tea requires heavy seasonal rainfall and is grown at altitudes that are less vulnerable to debris slumps.

“Farmers from Bushenyi, Kanungu, Mityana, Mbale, and Mukono—which are hilly—have been trained to grow tea, which can also be grown in greenhouses provided the soils are acidic,” Kemigisa said.

According to Nandudu, relocated communities also face lifestyle changes. They are unable to keep cattle in the new area and have to buy food, which was not the case in their former self-sufficient community.

Joseph Mafabi, who was relocated to Kiryandongo, had to find a new job in a refugee settlement to make ends meet. “I would have wanted to go back to the Elgon region, but the government is telling us that it is not safe to go back,” he said.

What Is Being Done

Community groups, government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations are working to reduce the frequency of landslides in Uganda, mostly by planting trees in vulnerable areas. In one settlement, a group of more than 100 teenagers began their own tree planting campaign to reduce the chance of future landslides.

Tom Obong Okello, executive director of Uganda’s National Forestry Authority (NFA), said the NFA has started planting trees on the slopes of Elgon to control soil erosion. “We are restoring the lost vegetation and trees to mitigate landslides in the area,” he said.

Trees for the Future, an international nonprofit organization, says it has planted more than 16 million trees in Uganda to help farmers restore their land and mitigate landslides.

David Duli, country director of World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Uganda, said WWF Uganda has helped organize community groups to reforest areas that have been the most affected by landslides. “Forests play a significant role in national development through their contribution to the ecological balance, energy, and industrial activities.…We have formed community groups to replant trees in areas that were affected by landslides, but we also wanted the community to own these initiatives,” Duli said.

Gardens, roads, and homes in five sub-counties of Dokolo district have been submerged by the rising water levels of Lake Kwania, making over a thousand families homeless.

The people affected have moved to higher grounds as the devastating floods continue to wreak havoc in the district.

Olga Hope Eriong, a resident of Acungapenyi, Kachung parish in Agwata sub-county says the community whose homes have been submerged by floods is experiencing problems of lack of food and shelter.

She says there is a scarcity of building materials, so they are facing difficulties in constructing new houses.

Middy Amek, a mother of four, whose home was affected says the water level started rising last year and since then, it has covered more than 700 metres inland towards her home.

""I have to leave this place but it's not easy, due to lack of building materials,"" she said.

Karina Akite, a resident of the place says she last witnessed such flooding in 1962 but that time, there was much rain.

The ceremonial ground near her home is all flooded. Dokolo RDC Lawrence Egole said they recently used the ground during a funeral.

Kuranimo Dai, another resident said their homes are greatly affected.

Dai said at night, it's very cold, there're many mosquitoes and snakes. He also said the flood water smells bad.

Nelson Okello, a youthful retail trader in the village said he is being forced out of his home by the flood.

Ronny Opio Okodi, a resident in the area said over 490 houses have been affected by the water in the village. He is appealing for emergency assistance to enable them to relocate to high land.

Ongom Apita, 66, says floods have destroyed his citrus farm.

""Even my fish pond and bananas that NAADS gave me were destroyed,"" he said.

Agwata sub-county LC3 Chairperson Geofrey Ojungu says most of the people in nine villages, are affected by the water from the lake Kwania.

""We are planning to relocate them to schools and sub-county headquarter's land,"" he said.

The district chairperson Fredrick Odongo says the floods have affected the sub-counties of Agwata, Adok, Kwera, Adeknino, Okwongdul, and Kangai.

""Last week we went to the sub-counties of Kwera, Adeknino, and Okwongodul and found a number of homes destroyed, gardens flooded, and roads destroyed,"" Odongo said.

He said the road network in the district has been greatly affected and they have to be reconstructed when the flood subsides.

He said in Agwata, where they visited on Monday, they found a similar situation.

""A number of farms and homes have been destroyed,"" Odongo said.

He said they wrote to the office of the Prime Minister who sent a consignment of relief items including 15, 000kg of maize flour, 5000kg of beans, and 50 bundles of tarpaulin.

Odongo added that they have not received 300 pieces of blankets as indicated in a letter dated May 28, 2020, signed by Rose Nakabugo on behalf of the Permanent Secretary.

The Chief Administrative Officer of Dokoo district Isa Mbooge says although the consignment was not enough, he shared with his colleagues of Amolatar and Kwania.

""We have to appreciate what they have given us because everybody is looking at the same source,"" Mbooge said.

Malteser International is preparing assistance for people affected in the Kasese district of western Uganda following the region’s worst flooding in almost 50 years. Days of torrential rains have triggered devastating floods that have caused four major rivers to burst their banks, forcing thousands from their homes and destroying roads, bridges and public buildings.

Laura Beutler, Technical Coordinator for Malteser International in Uganda, said: ""The largest hospital in Kasese has had to be evacuated, leaving people there without much-needed medical care. We will be sending eight ambulances and a medical team in support of health facilities in the district. A lack of urgent medical care would be catastrophic, especially under the present circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic.”

The floodwaters have damaged homes, latrines and water sources in Kasese district. Some 30,000 people are now homeless. “This disaster could have major implications for the COVID-19 response in the area,” said Beutler. “Those displaced have been forced to seek refuge in makeshift shelters where social distancing is practically impossible. The risk of COVID-19 spreading there is now high. To reduce the risk of infection, Malteser International will be providing daily access to clean water for up to 1,000 people affected by the flooding. We will also be working with our partners to provide information on safety measures against the novel coronavirus.”

Since late April, exceptional heavy seasonal rains have resulted in widespread across East Africa, killing nearly 300 people and causing a heavy loss of property. The disaster is compounding the risks to human health and food security from the COVID-19 pandemic and the worst locust infestation in decades.

For the past few days, it has been raining in many parts of the country and as is the unfortunate norm, whenever it rains, many areas including roads flood and are rendered impassable not to mention the destruction of property and sometimes lives. While we might not have control over the rain, we surely should be able to control the after effects.

Year after year, the country grapples with the problem of rain floods which are mainly caused by poor drainage systems, disregard of environmental guidelines such as erecting buildings in swampy areas that are prone to floods, poor garbage disposal which usually blocks drainage systems, in turn hindering passage of water, among others.

The Kampala Capital City Authority 2017 Kampala drainage master plan cites poor design and construction of drains, poor inter connectivity of drains, limited sensitisation of the public, unplanned settlements and poor enforcement mechanisms and mindsets of the people as some of the issues that affect drainage.

In Kampala for instance, the same areas keep flooding every time it rains heavily even for just a few hours, causing an aftermath of traffic jam and in unfortunate circumstances, accidents where people and vehicles are washed away by the floods.

Some of these areas include Industrial Area, where motorists can be seen daring the raging filthy water that takes over road space turning them into mini rivers. Since this is a recurring problem and is almost expected every year, it should be continually planned for and a lasting solution found.

The areas in different parts of the country that are prone to flooding should be identified before the rains start and a plan to prevent the effects of flooding be devised.

We shouldn’t have to keep crying foul about the same problem year in, year out as if it is impossible to solve. We could start with simple steps such as ensuring that man hole covers are intact as these have also been a death trap, especially when rain floods occur.

Then there’s the emphasis on the state of the drainage system. With well-planned and constructed drainage systems, we can alleviate floods.

As has been suggested before by many concerned and expert parties, these systems must undergo regular maintenance which includes unclogging and revaluating their ability and effectiveness to serve their purpose as the water volumes may keep increasing.

Better planning for urban settlement, harvesting rain water, respecting the natural water catchment areas are also probable steps to take.

While we appreciate that some work has been done to alleviate floods in some areas, more has to be done as the rain and consequent floods wait for no man.","Mon, 15 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.monitor.co.ug/resource/blob/3292088/9f8f53425beb42c7b5cb1151b22090c6/editpix-data.jpg,"['solution', 'areas', 'lets', 'kampala', 'lasting', 'drainage', 'rain', 'rains', 'floods', 'systems', 'water', 'poor', 'problem']",

KALAKI - Rising water levels on Lake Kyoga have ravaged three sub-counties in Kalaki district, leaving over 1,400 people helpless.

Scores of residents have fled their homes for safety. Some stay with relatives, while others have rented small units in trading centres.

The LC1 chairperson of Akura village in Kakure sub-county, Kalaki district, Charles Ochung, said the water levels started rising five months ago, but residents did not take it seriously.

Ochung said the most affected sub-counties are Kalaki, Bululu and Kakure.

Florence Engoru, a resident of Akura village, said the rising waters have paralysed transport since roads have been cut off.

Engoru said children in candidate classes from the affected sub-counties were finding it hard to access schools and are worried about how they will sit their examinations.

Engoru said she realised earlier that water levels were going up and left the village before the situation could get worse.

Those who remained behind are now crying out for assistance to be evacuated as more homes get submerged.

• The June to September 2020 seasonal rains over the northern and western sector of the region were above average across much of the region. Devastating floods occurred at the peak of the rainfall season, affecting over 2.5 million people and causing significant crop damage in riverine areas in Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, Ethiopia,

Somalia, Uganda, and Kenya.

• Crop losses were significant in several riverine areas, including along the Awash River in Ethiopia, the While and Blue Nile Rivers in South Sudan and Sudan, and the Juba and Shabelle Rivers in Somalia.

Outside of flood-affected areas, the seasonal rains were generally beneficial for crop and livestock production, water availability, and hydro-power generation across East Africa. The water-levels in major lakes, rivers, and dams are among the highest on record, especially in the Lake Victoria basin, major Rift Valley lakes, and White and Blue Nile Rivers.

• Desert locust swarms continue to form, and breeding is underway in Ethiopia, north-central Somalia, Yemen, and eastern Sudan. The situation in Ethiopia is of high concern, where government and other sources report significant damage to meher crops in Amhara, Tigray, and Oromia regions.

• Rangeland resources and livestock production conditions are exceptionally above average across most pastoral and agropastoral regions of East Africa due to two consecutive rainfall seasons of above average rainfall performance since late 2019. However, atypically high disease prevalence and livestock deaths are reported in South Sudan due to severe floods in 2019 and 2020.

• The 1-2 weeks rainfall outlook depicts the gradual southward shift of the tropical rainfall system from the northern to equatorial sectors. This marks a timely onset of the seasonal rains in bimodal South Sudan and Uganda, while the rains will gradually subside and reduce the risk of associated flooding in Sudan, unimodal South Sudan, Yemen, and Ethiopia.

The situation

Within a month (August to September) 2020, more than 1.21 million people in 12 different countries have been affected by floods across Africa and many other countries are currently experiencing more widespread rainfall than usual in the long rain season leading to transboundary flooding in several areas. Countries most affected by floods during the last five weeks are; Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Kenya, Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Mali. More countries are in trajectories of being affected by floods during the monsoon season which will continue till November. A brief overview of the situation is given below:

In Sudan, 17 of the country's 18 states have been affected, with North Darfur, Sennar, West Ordofan, and Kassala being the worst affected. More than 0.5 million people have been affected and 99 people have lost their lives and over 100,000 houses have been damaged. Thirty-four (34) schools and 2,671 health facilities have also been damaged. It has also been stated that the magnitude of rain and floods this year exceeds the 1988 and 1946 floods. The affected families are seeking shelter with relatives and host communities. Following a meeting with the Council of Ministers, the Security and Defence Council in Sudan has declared a state of emergency for three months in the whole country and formation of a higher committee to mitigate the effects of the floods

In South Sudan, over 600,000 people were displaced by floods according to the United Nations (UN). Flooding along the White Nile has affected four counties in six states since July 2020. Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding in vast areas and settlements along the White Nile in the center of the country, with the states of Jonglei and Lakes being the worst affected. According to a Rapid Needs Assessment, priorities include water, purification tablets, plastic sheeting for temporary shelter, mosquito nets, fishing kits, and medicines for Malaria, Diarrhea and other waterborne diseases

In Kenya, rains led to the displacement of over 100,000 people and 194 people lost their lives. In Ethiopia, rains affected over 200,000 people and caused 8 deaths. Flooding in Uganda saw 5,000 people displaced and 6 deaths with 3,800 people on the Lake Islands in Mayuga District evacuated due to an increased water level in Lake Victoria.

According to the Niger Red Cross Society and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), in Niger, more than 88,000 people have been affected by floods in 8 regions of Niger – Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Niamey, Tahoua, Tillaberi and Zinder – with 33 deaths and 9,568 houses collapsed. Many people have been displaced and had to seek refuge in schools and host families.

In Chad, almost 120,000 people have been displaced by floods during the August 2020 rains. According to a report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 32,000 of those displaced were in N’Djamena, where 10 people lost their lives.

• The March to May (MAM) rainfall period was one of the wettest the region has seen since 1981 (Figure 1), following an already record wet 2019 October to December (OND) rainfall period.

• The early onset of rains and above-average rainfall since February promoted land preparation and planting activities for the MAM season across Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, along with the Belg season in Ethiopia.

• However, the abundant rains have also caused localized flooding, mudslides, flashfloods, and river overflows over the past months causing casualties, population displacement, infrastructure damage, and crop damage in parts of Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and Yemen.

• Cropping conditions remain generally favourable as rains are expected to be beneficial to planting and crop development across much of the region; however, localized losses and crop damage are expected in areas worst affected by flooding (Figure 2).

• Abundant rains have also promoted the breeding and development of desert locusts and protracted the outbreak across the region, which continues to pose a significant threat to main season crops.

Torrential rains have triggered devastating floods and landslides across East Africa in recent weeks, aggravating an already challenging situation as countries in the region battle the coronavirus pandemic.

The destruction caused by the heavy rainfall has killed hundreds of people in Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Rwanda and Ethiopia and has also forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.

This week, officials in Kenya and Rwanda said nearly 200 and 65 people had died in both countries, respectively, with floodwaters and mudslides destroying houses, washing away bridges and straining critical infrastructure.

On Saturday, Kenyan and Uganda suffered nationwide electricity outages, leaving tens of millions of people without power.

Health experts are worried about the implications of the flooding on the countries’ response to the coronavirus pandemic.

“This is compounding the COVID-19 response,” Kenya Health Ministry Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman said.

“The displaced people have been forced to congregate in makeshift camps with the risk of banding together exposing them to the possibility of contracting the virus.”

Floodwaters also recently swept away most parts of an entire small town in Somalia and swept away roads, bridges and a hospital in Uganda.

Heavy rains flooded areas around Mountain Rwenzori in western Uganda after Nyamwamba River burst its banks, forcing people to seek refuge in nearby schools and destroying roads and bridges, according to officials.

“What complicates the matter is that this is the era of COVID. People are expected to maintain social distance, but how do you maintain distance in such a situation?” Julius Mucunguzi, spokesman for the prime minister’s office, was quoted as saying by the Reuters News Agency.

One of the hospitals in the area, Kilembe, was also washed away despite being built on a raised bank and reinforced with sandbags.

“There are wards which were completely washed away. The mortuary was swept away. You wouldn’t know that once upon a time there was a mortuary there. The drugs and drug stores were washed away,” Mucunguzi said.

The Somali region in eastern Ethiopia has also been hard hit by the floods, with more than 100,000 people displaced, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

Meanwhile, an unspecified number of people were killed in the semi-autonomous Puntland region in Somalia when flash floods swept away most buildings in Qardho town, officials said.

The heavy rains stem from moisture dumped in the region by winds coming in from the Indian Ocean where temperatures have risen in recent months, said Chris Shisanya, a professor of climatology at Kenyatta University in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.

“This is a carry-over of what we had last year,” he said, referring to floods and landslides in the region.

The floods are coming as swarms of locusts are wreaking havoc across East Africa where millions of people struggle for food.

Billions of desert locusts have already chomped their way through Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti, Eritrea, Tanzania, Sudan and Uganda.

Two of its biggest plants, the 180-megawatt Nalubaale and 200-megawatt Kiira plants outside Jinga, are being battered by rising flood waters and floating papyrus.

On April 14, a floating mass of papyrus mats (used across Lake Victoria and now cast afloat like islands) crunched into the dam wall. Bits of papyrus were sucked into the turbines. The country was plunged into a blackout as around 20% of the grid’s capacity suddenly went offline.

The story of that moment started six months earlier, in October, when it started raining in Uganda. It hasn’t stopped since. Lake Victoria’s levels have risen by 1.3m and are just 8cm away from their highest-ever level. Similar downpours filled the lake in the early 1960s and mid 1990s.

With 23 rivers feeding the lake and only one exit, past Jinga and into the Nile, Lake Victoria is perfect for hydropower. To help alleviate the pressure, the amount of water being released at Jinja has more than doubled.

But this isn’t just an issue of too much rain. Human expansion has played a large role.

In a press release detailing the government response, Uganda’s water and environment minister, Sam Cheptoris, said a loss of forest cover as well as encroachment on wetlands and river banks meant that there was more silt in the lake and fewer natural barriers to fast-flowing flood waters. Towns and roads also mean more cement and tar, so rainwater doesn’t soak into the ground and instead goes straight into rivers.

The higher water levels have meant jetties and landing sites being submerged, leading to a halt in ferries. The floating mats have also become a hazard to other shipping; so vital to local economies. Resorts, hotels and homes have been flooded. The flooding is also affecting Lake Kyoga, with flooding at a much lower level in Lake Albert.

Cheptoris noted that drinking water and sanitation systems have also been affected by the deluge, with a likely increase in water-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, malaria and bilharzia.

In response to the crisis, Cheptoris said the government will “remove” anyone encroaching on water bodies and forests. Chiefs who have not taken “action against encroachers” will also be dismissed.

Practically, this affects people within 100m of river banks, 30m of wetlands and 200m of lake shores and forest reserves.","Wed, 06 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://bucket.mg.co.za/wp-media/2019/03/5deeba24-brisbane-besieged-by-onceinacentury-floods.jpeg,"['lake', 'started', 'cuts', 'power', 'floating', 'wetlands', 'river', 'response', 'uganda', 'water', 'flooding', 'victoria', 'waters']",

By John Marsham and colleagues

A year of exceptional rainfall, floods and locust outbreaks is decreasing the resilience of vulnerable populations in East Africa just at the time of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The combination of these disasters is not random, as the floods, lake level and locusts can all been linked to climate change.

Covid-19 is a zoonotic virus, which means it has been transmitted from animals to humans. The illegal global trade in wild animals (notably Pangolins, which are largely exported to China) has been directly damaging East Africa’s ecology for years and, even if not yet proven to be the case for Covid-19, such trade increases the chance of zoonotic pandemics.

Water levels of Lake Victoria have just reached the highest point ever in the 120 year record, displacing thousands and flooding infrastructure.

Other floods in the region have displaced tens of thousands of people and killed hundreds. The locust outbreak is the worst in 70 years and may, according to the UN, grow 400-fold by June.

Combined, these increase vulnerability and reduce the ability of the population to engage in social distancing and to practise basic hygiene just as the Covid-19 crisis hits East Africa.

The Lake Victoria basin is home to around 40 million people. The lake is the largest tropical lake in the world and its outflow is a major hydropower source.

The lake has major cities of around 5 million people on its shores, including Kampala, the capital of Uganda.

Lake Victoria is unusual in that it receives most of its water directly from rainfall, not from rivers, and loses most by evaporation, rather than through its outflow: the lake level has varied by around 3m over the last 120 years.

The rise in Lake Victoria levels is one of the fastest on record. East Africa has experienced major flooding since October 2019.

The exceptional 2019 rainfall was caused by warm waters in the western Indian Ocean (called a positive “Indian Ocean Dipole”, which also contributed to the Australian fires). Together with effects of tropical cyclones and westerlies between October and December this led to the Lake Victoria basin experiencing 150 to 200% of its usual rainfall.

January and February 2020 also had above average rain, possibly related to persistent warm water in the western Indian Ocean. Climate change is expected to have increased the probability of these events and so the rapid lake level rise. March to May 2020 have seen further heavy rainfall, pushing up lake levels to the near record-breaking level.

Although we do expect climate change to favour such rapid rises in lake level, it is too early to say for certain whether we expect climate change to give higher or lower lake levels overall in the long term.

It is clear though that water management plans must plan for changes due to climate change, such as the recent rapid rise.

The fact that Lake Victoria spans three nations, and is a source of the White Nile that then supplies water to South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt, means that plans for Lake Victoria have international implications, so agreements and plans should be made well in advance, to allow adequate time to address the complex issues this will raise.

Climate change will continue to intensify rainfall and flood management must adapt.

The event illustrates how ‘natural disasters’, sometimes enhanced by climate change, are often interconnected. The exceptional rain of 2019/2020 has led to flooding directly from the rainfall, as well as from rivers and the lake, and has been linked to disease outbreaks.

The weather has affected crop growth and food prices, and has contributed to the locust outbreak. People in the region are suffering impacts of these events and Covid-19 simultaneously, or in quick succession, reducing their ability to cope, and acute food insecurity is growing.

Projected impacts of climate change on populations and ecosystems, and plans to increase resilience, must account for such systematic sequences of inter-connected events, as well as random sequencing of unrelated disasters.

The work reported on in this story is part of two projects: (1) FCFA’s HyCRISTAL project (funded by DFID and NERC) which is working to both improve climate information for East Africa, and use this to inform long-term decision making in the region, (2) HyTpp (funded by DFID, through the Corridors for Growth Trust Fund administered by the World Bank), which is analysing possible Lake Victoria water levels under climate change.

More than 10,000 people who were displaced by the recent floods in Kasese District face starvation amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Kasese District Covid-19 taskforce is facing a hard time enforcing the Ministry of Health and Presidential directives aimed at stemming the spread of the pandemic in the 27 camps.

Kasese District was on May 7 and 22 hit by floods when five rivers; Lhubiriha, Mubuku, Nyamwamba, Nyamughasana and Sebwe burst their banks and affected communities in seventeen sub-counties as well as Bulembia and Nyamwamba Divisions in Kasese Municipality.

Speaking to Daily Monitor in an interview at the weekend, Mr Joshua Kisembo Masereka, the Kasese Deputy Resident District Commissioner, said the state of people living in camps scattered across various sub-counties is appalling.

“Those living in camps are traumatised and are faced with emotional and mental stress emanating from the losses they registered at an individual level,” he said.

The camps housing stranded people include; Kanyangeya, Nkaiga and Kiraro primary schools having the highest number of people concentrated in one place.

When *Daily Monitor *visited one of the camps at Kiraro Primary School, no one was seen wearing a facemask.\ Despite presence of a hand washing facility that the taskforce have improvised, no one was seen washing hands.

Mr Peter Mutooro, the camp chairperson, said they have failed to enforce the directives against Covid-19 because they are facing hunger.

""Because of Covid-19, we have started decongesting families to the nearby churches and schools so that they reduce on the numbers,"" said Mr Mutooro.

Ms Harriet Kabugho, who chairs the committee overseeing affairs for girls within the camp, said their rights as girls were being violated every day. She explained that five of her friends have been sexually harassed by the boys within the same camp.

""We do not have bathrooms, we use the same latrines and we might contract sexually transmitted diseases,"" Ms Kabugho said.

The coordinator for Centre for Gender Quality, a non-governmental organisation based in Kasese town, Ms Jolly Mbambu, advised that people who are living in camps need to be resettled.

""This will not be the first time government is resettling flood victims. It was properly done during the Bududa landslides saga,"" Ms Mbambu said.

Damage

A tentative impact assessment by the district disaster committee that was presented to the State Minister for Disaster Preparedness, Mr Musa Ecweru, in May indicates that a total of 123,800 people, most of them women and children from more than 24,760 households have been directly affected by the floods.

The most affected areas include Kilembe, Karambi, Bugoye, Maliba, Mpondwe Lhubiriha Town Council, Karusandara, Kyarumba, Mubuku Town Council and the three divisions of Kasese Municipality.","Mon, 08 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flash-flood.png,"['living', 'town', 'starvation', 'mr', 'victims', 'district', 'covid19', '10000', 'kasese', 'affected', 'camps', 'uganda', 'ms', 'washing', 'face', 'flood']",

More than 150 families, part of the 10,000 people who were displaced by the floods two years ago after water levels in Lake Albert rose, are living in a dire condition.

The lives of many locals who have gathered in Kanara Sub-county, Ntoroko District near Lake Albert, are being threatened since the temporal houses erected in water are on the verge of collapsing. The families are also in dire need of food and other essential basic needs.

The unstable houses, made of iron sheets, and reeds are being held by timber poles erected in water, some of which are rotting away and can no longer hold their weight.

Mr Justice Kabagambe,46, a resident of Kamuga Village in Kanara Sub-county, Ntoroko District, one of the affected people, in April last year erected a temporary house above the water after his house that is a few metres away from the shores of Lake Albert, was submerged by floods.

Following the incident, he joined another family whose house was submerged days later. “I decided to build a temporary four-room house where I am staying with my family,” he said.

“The family is not sure of a single meal in a day but we get support from friends and well-wishers. My house is not stable and it shakes whenever it gets windy, especially at night, we fear it may collapse,” Mr Kabagambe added.

Mr Kabagambe’s house is surrounded by 40 others in the same condition. The houses are hard to access and one has to use a boat as a means of transport to visit friends and family members settled away from the flooded area. Similarly, food and other requirements are transported by boat from the dry areas. The operators of the few available boats demand a fee for their services.

There are a few makeshift shops built above the flooded areas. Mr Kabagambe’s family is forced to keep indoors since they have no compound.

The communities also lack clean water for domestic use and are forced to draw contaminated water from the lake.

The families lack toilets too and are forced to defecate in the water. “We use the same water to ease ourselves since our toilets and tap stands were submerged,” Mr Kabagambe said.

His plight is shared by more than 150 families who have found shelter above the water.

The sub-counties that are mostly affected include Kamuga, Kachwakumu and Rwangara. The affected families are, however, holding on to hope that the government will come to their rescue.

Those who were displaced in 2019 and later in 2020, were first sheltered in nearby schools of Umoja, Rwangara and Kachwakumu, which were later submerged. The floods left homes, shops, schools, gardens and health facilities submerged.

Last year when the State minister for Disaster Preparedness and Refugees, Mr Musa Ecweru, and other officials visited the area, local leaders requested government to relocate them to Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve.

Current situation

The chairperson of Kachwakumu Village, Mr Rwaheru Byaruhanga, said while some people sought refuge with friends and family, others have nowhere to go.

He said more than 200,000 houses are still submerged and only rooftops are seen floating on top of water. “People spend days indoors and school-going children have not reported to school because their schools were submerged. Our people have also risked their lives because any time, these makeshift houses may collapse. They will also contract disease because they use contaminated water,” Mr Byaruhanga said.

Lack of food

Ntoroko District’s main economic activity is fishing and cattle keeping. The livelihood of locals was greatly hit since the floods affected livestock farming.

Accessing health centres is also a big challenge and they have to hire boats to reach Butungama or Rwebisengo sub-county for medical service. The nearby Rwangara Health Centre III was submerged.

Dr James Kato, the officer-in-charge of Rwebisengo Health Centre III, said they have to travel long distances to pick drugs.

Mr Byaruhanga said since 2019, they have been requesting the government to relocate them to Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve.

The chairperson of Kanara Sub-county, Mr Friday Mugiisa, said they have never received any relief food.

“People who are stuck in floods have no food to eat and they have been depending on fish. Last month, the UPDF fishing unit on Lake Albert destroyed all boats after accusing our people of illegal fishing,” Ms Mugiisa said.

The Ntoroko County Member of Parliament, Mr Gerald Rwemurikya Ibanda, last year told Daily Monitor that the government had promised to relocate the displaced people and settle them at Tooro Semliki Wildlife Reserve. This has not been fulfilled.

“The acres they are talking about are not enough, but sadly, they haven’t been availed to the people,” he said.

The acting chairperson of Ntoroko District, Mr Ben Muthahinga, said they recently received some relief items such as beans, posho and blankets from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), which they want to distribute to displaced people.

He said last week, the Minister for Tourism, Mr Tom Butiime, was in the area to discuss the relocation plan.

Mr Butiime confirmed that he visited Rwebisengo Town Council and held a meeting with local leaders and they agreed that Uganda Wildlife Authority reduces the restrictions on cattle keepers so that they can graze their animals in certain parts of the park.

He said the restrictions will only be applicable for farmers who have cattle but not for people who want to construct shelters in the park.

The Tourism boss also said the affected locals are being registered by the sub-county chief and they will soon be allowed to graze in the park.

Mr Julius Muchunguzi, the head of communications at the OPM, said: “The government is in the process of identifying land where the affected people can be relocated to. We have been supporting them with relief food.”

The continuous rains that started at 2:20am and continued consecutively for hours triggered flooding from uphill, which carried a huge mass of soil down the hills into river Bugibuni, prompting it to burst its banks and causing havoc to the communities downhill. The river carried massive water, logs of huge trees, soil debris down the slope and swept off houses and crops adjacent to it. The flash floods damaged houses of 111 households, with a population of 426 persons. Fortunately, no deaths were registered. Crops, merchandise, animals and properties worth millions of shillings were destroyed by the floodwaters. (IFRC, 24 Jun 2019)

Several landslides and floods across Bulambuli District (eastern Uganda) have resulted in 1 death and 19 missing. The most affected areas include Nabiwutulu, Gimadu Bugatiisa, and Buluganya Counties. The Uganda Red Cross Society is conducting an assessment to establish magnitude of the disaster and the needs of the people affected. Eastern Uganda was already affected by a series of landslides in early June this year, when at least 5 died. Moderate to locally heavy rain is forecast across most of Uganda on 2-3 September.

The risks include flooding, drowning, prolonged hot seasons and water scarcity, among others.

WWF Country Director David Duri (L) During a press conference at their offices in Kamwokya Kampala--

The number of people drowning due to flooding is projected to increase as Kampala city faces a shocking rise in climate change-related risks. This is according to a report; the water risk scenarios estimate research conducted by the World Wide Fund for Nature.



Launched ahead of the World Cities’ Day 2020, marked today, the reports puts Kampala on the list of 100 other cities that are expected to suffer the greatest rise in water risk problems by 2050. The risks include flooding, drowning, prolonged hot seasons and water scarcity, among others.



The report further reveals that Kampala faces the 7th highest increase in the water risks above for cities across Africa with a 10 per cent rise by the year 2050. WWF country director David Duri observes an urgent need to reclaim the preserve of urban wetlands to save the city from a high price resulting from worsening water risks.



Human activity and the destruction of wetlands has over the years been highlighted as the main cause of flooding in the city, even after light rains. Flooding is mainly seen in the city suburbs of Kyambogo-Banda, Kabuusu, Kinawataka, Kyebando-Nsooba, Bwaise, Namungoona, Nalukolongo, parts of Kasubi, Katanga, Katwe, Namasuba, Zana, and even in the city centre.



Duri mentioned Bugolobi Wetlands, Nakivubo channel, Mayanja wetland along Mityana road and others which have been encroached on, raising the risk of uncontrollable water scenarios on people’s lives and their businesses.

World Cities Day 2020 is the seventh global celebration since the day was launched on 31 October 2014 in Shanghai, China Under the theme of Better City, Better Life.



The day aims to focus the international community’s attention on urbanisation as a central issue for development and to encourage cooperation among countries in meeting opportunities and addressing urban challenges towards sustainable development.



It also seeks to promote global interest in urbanization and engender international cooperation to address the challenges of urbanization, thereby contributing to sustainable urban development. The sub-theme for this year is Valuing our communities and cities.","Sat, 31 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://ugandaradionetwork.net/a/helpers/image.php?fileId=232759&m=0&w=960&h=960,"['radionetwork', 'risks', 'cities', 'risk', 'report', 'kampala', 'city', 'rise', 'day', 'wwf', 'uganda', 'water', 'flooding']",

59,59,FL-2019-000066-UGA,Massive flooding latest crisis to hit East Africa - Crux Now,https://cruxnow.com/church-in-africa/2020/10/massive-flooding-latest-crisis-to-hit-east-africa/,"YAOUNDÉ, Cameroon – East Africa has been suffering a series of intense floods that have affected an estimated 6 million people.

The natural disaster is just one of several challenges facing the region, including continuing invasions by locust swarms and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Countries affected include Rwanda, Kenya, Somalia, Burundi, Ethiopia, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti and Tanzania.

“In some areas, the lack of infrastructure or damage to roads, bridges and airstrips has made accessing flood zones far more difficult, which in turn makes it more difficult to provide assistance,” said Matt Davis, the East Africa regional director of the Catholic Relief Services.

He told Crux the crises affecting East Africa can all be linked back to climate change.

“To help prevent floods in the future and mitigate the impact, we need to make more concerted efforts to preserve and restore watersheds and landscapes. We need to support communities to improve their livelihoods while restoring and maintaining the natural environment,” Davis said.

What follows are excerpts of his conversation with Crux.

Crux: Widespread flooding has once again hit East Africa. Can you give us a sense of the enormity of the disaster?

Davis: East Africa has been experiencing torrential rains and flooding since July and almost six million people have been impacted. Around 1.5 million people have lost their homes or have been displaced by the floods and many areas are still underwater. People’s homes, crops, livestock and personal possessions have been washed away, and there has been significant damage to infrastructure.

This is all happening before the start of the short rains, which should peak in November. In some areas, the lack of infrastructure or damage to roads, bridges and airstrips has made accessing flood zones far more difficult, which in turn makes it more difficult to provide assistance. This flooding is putting hardship upon hardship for people in the region, who have also been impacted by COVID-19 and pests like desert locusts.

Catholic Relief Services is on the ground working with local partners and national governments to distribute emergency food and other necessities. Working in partnership, we’ve been providing life-saving assistance to tens of thousands of people across affected areas.

However, there is an urgent need for more funding to ensure that basic needs continue to be met, and to prevent the spread of malaria and other waterborne diseases. Though our response varies country-by-country, we are generally support families with food, water, shelter, basic essentials, sanitation, and providing cash or vouchers which in turn supports the local economy. We also support health systems to address things like malnutrition and other health-related risks. In some areas, families receive seeds, tools and fishing kits so they can have a livelihood and feed themselves.

How do these flood compare to previous flooding in the region?

Even if you just look at the floods over the last four years, the impacts and the number of people affected have grown exponentially. From Ethiopia to South Sudan to Uganda, we’re seeing communities that year after year are impacted by both floods as well as recurring drought in some places.

Our staff in various countries often comments on how weather patterns have changed, or how rain is erratic. They also say that this is the worst flooding they have seen in decades.

Many environmentalists and other experts are blaming climate change.

The locust swarms, floods, recurring drought and COVID-19 all link back to climate change in some way, and East Africa in particular is feeling the effects.

To help prevent floods in the future and mitigate the impact, we need to make more concerted efforts to preserve and restore watersheds and landscapes. We need to support communities to improve their livelihoods while restoring and maintaining the natural environment. Alternatives to charcoal, a big reason for deforestation, need to be scaled up and promoted more widely. We also have to prioritize to support communities to protect forests and plant trees.

It’s difficult to protect against some of the risks, but there are measures that can be taken to help people cope with disasters like droughts and floods that have been made worse by climate change.

For example, it’s important to ensure that people live far enough away from rivers and channels to prevent disasters like flash flooding and landslides while also better managing excess runoff.

In East Africa, we’re increasing our efforts toward landscape restoration and re-greening while at the same time providing people with a more diverse set of income opportunities and training on how to be better prepared should disaster strike.

As you said, the floods are coming amid the COVID-19 pandemic and a series of locusts swarms. This really is a triple crisis.

The combined impacts of the floods, recurrent drought, conflict, desert locust swarms, COVID-19 and the pandemic-related economic downturn are making it really hard for people to recover. Like here, months-long lockdowns also mean that many people in the region haven’t been able to work, thus losing their ability to put food on the table.

For governments and humanitarian organizations like CRS, this also creates additional strain on already scarce resources. For example, the teams sent out to manage pests like desert locusts have to take additional precautions because of coronavirus. In some remote areas, people have not even heard of the coronavirus and are not aware of the potential risk. There are a lot of misconceptions, creating more risk for frontline workers.

Early on when COVID-19 emerged as a threat in the region, we adjusted how we interacted with project participants so we could continue to provide critical support while adhering to the necessary safety precautions. So, while we had to adapt quickly, we have also largely managed to continue our emergency responses, like food or cash distributions, for example.

For example, in South Sudan, we haven’t been able to do food air drops because airstrips have been flooded. And hunger is growing because farmland is flooded, too.

In terms of COVID-19, overall, our donors have been really flexible and supportive, encouraging us to continue to provide critical support in the communities where we work. That said, funding for a large-scale COVID-19 response has not really materialized, so communities have mostly had to make do with what they had, and weather the pandemic as best they can.","Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cruxnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1000-3-5.jpeg,"['africa', 'crisis', 'food', 'support', 'east', 'massive', 'covid19', 'hit', 'communities', 'need', 'floods', 'flooding', 'latest', 'difficult']",

But the flood water has not receded, the people are still marooned and now they are facing severe hunger.

Unusually heavy rains began last July, and the White Nile burst its banks, destroyed all the crops and encroached on farms and villages, affecting Jonglei and other states, leaving people to scramble for a few strips of dry land.

Fields are still submerged, mud homes and stiff sticks of dead maize are slowly collapsing into the water, entire villages have been abandoned and large areas turned into swamps. Of the 62 villages served by Old Fangak’s central market, 45 are devastated by the flooded river.

The July harvest would have fed the local people through to this spring but all the crops were lost. Families sleep in abandoned schools or in the open on scraps of higher land. There is no question of migrating to dry areas as the flood extends for miles and at least Old Fangak is secluded from the constant conflict that besets much of the rest of the country.

The UN says that about 1.6 million people have been affected by the floods in a country where already at least 7.5 million people need assistance. A recent report by the Integrated food security Phase Classification, (IPC), an initiative by 15 organisations to tackle malnutrition, estimates that 6.4 million people, about half the population, will face acute food insecurity in 2021, and for half of them their lack of food will be an emergency.

Some people in South Sudan, such as those from Old Fangak, are partially or completely cut off from humanitarian aid. Access to the town is difficult in normal times, but the detritus of the floods has blocked the airstrip, which was cleared from the bush, and boat access from the river.

Data from South Sudan suggests that more erratic and unpredictable weather patterns are now the norm.

The floods were caused by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), also known as the “Indian El Niño, a weather pattern discovered only in 1999. The strongest IOD to strike east Africa in 61 years happened in 2019. So when the rains arrived in 2020 in South Sudan, the water from the previous year had not yet receded, resulting in more devastating floods. This year’s rainfall could further worsen the situation, making the resultant hunger catastrophic.

“People will die of hunger. Everyone in Old Fangak is lacking food and lost what they cultivated. Hunger is the one that will kill people,” says Peter Kak, a fisherman and grandfather of five who lives on a grass island with his son Samuel. The two men stayed behind after sending the rest of the family to higher ground. Here, they fish every day.

“Flooding, conflict, Covid-19 and poverty make the situation here dire,” says Sulaiman Sesay, of Action Against Hunger, one of the few aid organisations active in this area of South Sudan. “The world needs to know that people are suffering in this way.”

The socioeconomic measures adopted in response to the pandemic have affected already critical hunger situations in vulnerable places such as South Sudan. A joint report by the World Food Programme and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that threatening global hunger levels seem to be reaching new highs.

In Old Fangak people grew sorghum, a cereal that is easy to cultivate. Now they can eat only water lilies and fish. But not everyone has fishing nets and for those who do the catches are rarely enough to satisfy the appetite.

“There’s not enough sorghum, so we have to resort to the water lily,” explains Samuel Gai. The flowers have to be collected in great numbers to grind and make a small amount of cereal.

Despite the severity of the floods, the people of Old Fangak refuse to give up. In the face of rising waters, hunger and isolation from the rest of the country, the community shows extraordinary resilience.

“We cooperate,” says Joseph Martin, a villager helping to repair the constantly collapsing airstrip dyke. “The women take the water out with buckets and we put the mud on the dykes to prevent water leaking in. They do their part and we do our part.

“When there is work, men and women work together and they cooperate. Some of the people come and work even without us asking them … this is how we do it, if there is work to save the town, we work together,.”

Moving water by the bucketload all day takes a huge toll on hungry people. “Because of this water, I’ve lost weight. We are doing this alone, all day and night throwing water over the dyke. Nobody comes to help us. We are all exhausted,” says Nyayen Chuol, who works on the dyke with her elderly mother.

Where dykes have already been breached many people move on to neighbours’ homes and start again, helping to keep other dykes strong.

“I’m worried all the time. At night I’m trying to stay awake with a fire so I can burn a bit of grass and go check if the dyke is leaking or about to break. Every night. I’m so worried I can’t even sleep thinking that if I fall asleep the dyke could break and I can drown,” says Nyayang Kich, who had to abandon her flooded home for the higher ground of her neighbour.

The water sitting stagnant is compromising health too, leading to a spike in malaria-carrying mosquitoes.

“The climate has changed from the years when I was young because we have never experienced floods like this before. What we are experiencing now is horrible. We are suffering from hunger and we didn’t before. The climate has changed. For old people it’s horrible. It’s hard moving in this water; we don’t know where to sleep or what to eat. We are in God’s hands,” says 83-year-old Mary Nyamat.","Fri, 19 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98594f91e045de1aa58e97ae674b51bf2afed6fa/0_650_8272_4963/master/8272.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=11e7d9fdab4148e3e033de26dd5f581e,"['south', 'hunger', 'villages', 'food', 'work', 'night', 'land', 'drowned', 'old', 'sudans', 'flooded', 'floods', 'sudan', 'water', 'fangak', 'stalks']",

In December 2019, five people were killed by floods in Kampala after a downpour.

The dead included a police officer, an army officer and three others.

Earlier on May 26, 2019, eight other people died in a similar manner.

The floods hit many parts of the capital, cut off roads and destroyed several property in Kampala and surrounding areas of Bwaise, Nateete, Nalukolongo, Bugolobi, Nakawa ,Industrial Area, and Kyambogo. About 500 households were affected.

Following these incidents, Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) carried out a risk assessment and identified the most dangerous or risky roads that are vulnerable to floods during rainy season.

Based on the findings of the assessment, on March 24, 2021, KCCA issued a warning to Kampala residents about the flood hotspots and warned road users and residents.

This comes shortly after the Uganda weather authorities forecast that the country will be seeing more heavy rain characterised by flooding, strong winds, and lightning.

“Due to the current heavy rain, the public is warned that there will be a number of inconveniences from flooding i.e. submerging some of our roads and collapse of our aged infrastructure. Further, our transport infrastructure will be directly or indirectly damaged during these weather conditions posing a threat to human safety and causing significant disruption,” a KCCA public notice states.

“This arises from an inefficient storm water drainage system that is intended to manage overland flow. Government is organising funding to implement the Kampala Drainage Master Plan, which is intended to solve this problem,” the notice added.

Damaged roads

Many city roads are in poor state with potholes and a big number have been washed away.

Last week, a drainage channel at Mukwano Road roundabout that was completed last month caved in. The public accused Uganda National Roads Authority, KCCA officials, and contractors of connivance to do shoddy work on the channel.

One Twitter user, Mr Keith Ahumuza, posted that such shoddy works points to the issue of bad governance that Uganda is grappling with.

“The events playing out in our country currently from debts, injustices, corruption scandals, substandard works, and judicial issues are fruits of the kind of system that has been sown. Africa’s problem is not its people but the governance systems. God has His way of embarrassing,” he tweeted.

Ms Sharon Keitesi, another Twitter user, drew parallels with Tanzania, noting that if such had happened there, heads would have rolled at KCCA.

“If this had happened in Tanzania under the late Magufuli leadership, all the KCCA engineering team would be in jail but since this is Uganda, that’s normal and it cannot make any of the concerned authorities panic,” she tweeted.

On their part, the city authorities said: “There were defects on the recently completed works by one of our contractors on a Nakivubo Channel section at Mukwano Roundabout on Sixth Street, Industrial Area. The contractor, who undertook the failed works, shall be required to remedy according to the contract.”

“We appeal to the public to take precautions while using public infrastructure during the rainy season as government puts in place mechanisms to improve it,” a KCCA statement read.

Hopeful

Kampala drainage master plan

The city authorities completed the new Kampala Drainage Master Plan in December 2017.

According to a report to Parliament, the master plan provides structural measures to improve the city drainage and non-structural measures such as improving solid waste management and promoting use of green/pervious compounds to absorb floods.

KCCA officials say the implementation will cost $208m (about Shs758.6 billion). It is not clear if the funding for the master plan has been secured.

Last month was the warmest November in history. This followed the hottest January, May and September. All-time temperature peaks were registered from the Antarctic to the Arctic. Since the start of the year, Australia, Siberia and California have suffered record fires. The Atlantic has generated record storms. Ice in the Laptev Sea has started forming later than ever.

The coronavirus pandemic may have dominated the news and temporarily reduced emissions. But 2020 has also demonstrated the increasingly evident impact of human-driven global heating. The six hottest years in human history have all occurred since 2014. That sequence will certainly continue for a seventh year. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) will soon know whether 2020 will take first, second or third place in the all-time ranking.

Scientists are surprised temperatures have been so high in the absence of an El Niño, the phenomenon that boosts warmer years such as the current record, 2016. On the contrary, the latter half of this year there was the emergence of a cooling La Niña, which churned up chillier-than-normal waters in the equatorial Pacific. Petteri Taalas, the secretary-general of the WMO, said that without this influence, 2020 would certainly have been the warmest year ever measured.

In climate terms, the long-term trend is more important than individual records, but it is the latter that directly affects lives and livelihoods. Unusual heat, drought, fires or storms can be caused by natural variation, local factors or industrial emissions, but scientists are increasingly able to identify that extreme weather events are more frequent and intense as greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere.

“2020 has been another very hot year. We see very strongly the impact of what that means on the changing intensity and likelihood of extreme weather events,” said Friederike Otto, the associate director of the Environmental Change Institute at University of Oxford and co-lead of the World Weather Attribution initiative (WWA). “Every year of more emissions and increasing global mean temperature has an impact on people.”

Humankind’s fingerprint was particularly evident in the Siberian heatwave, which was made at least 600 times more probable by humans, and the Australian bushfires, which were made more than 30% more likely.

Here is how this year unfolded with global heating at 1.1C above pre-industrial levels. This toll may seem horrifying, but it is just a sample – and will be modest compared with a future world on course for more than 3C of warming.

Record floods in Indonesia kill at least 19 people, with 62,000 evacuated. The national meteorological agency reports the highest daily rainfall seen in Jakarta since records began in 1866: “This is not ordinary rain.”

4 January

Temperatures in the Sydney basin hit a new high of 48.9C, the latest in a series of records in Australia. Bushfires create a 620 miles (1,000km) wide, 21 miles high smoke cloud, three times bigger than anything seen in the world before. It spreads so far that black charcoal reaches Antarctica. Scientists describe it as “a new benchmark on the magnitude of stratospheric perturbations”.

FEBRUARY

6 February

Record mainland Antarctic heat. The Argentinian research base Esperanza on the northern tip of the Antarctic peninsula, measures a new high for the southern continent of 18.4C (65.3F).

9 February

Record Antarctic island heat. The 20.75C logged by Brazilian scientists at Seymour Island is almost a full degree higher than the previous record of 19.8C in 1982. This has still to be confirmed by the WMO.

MARCH

Second-hottest March on record

31 March

The Australian bushfire season comes to an end after more than six months of destruction – 33 fatalities, 3,000 homes burned, and more than 10m hectares (25m acres) razed. Wildlife deaths are estimated at more than 1bn mammals, birds and reptiles combined, and hundreds of billions of insects. From the beginning of September 2019 to 23 February 2020, bushfires have emitted 434m tonnes of carbon dioxide, equivalent to about three-quarters of the discharges of Australian industry. Studies by the WWA indicate the bushfires were made at least 30% more probable by human-driven climate change. The summer of 2019-2020 is the second-hottest ever, after the previous year’s summer.

20 June

Record Arctic heat. The Russian town of Verkhoyansk registers 38C (more than 100F) amid a freakishly prolonged Siberian heatwave. Siberian wildfires cover almost 1m hectares and release 59m tonnes of carbon dioxide, surpassing last year’s record. On average, temperatures in this region of the Arctic have been 5C above average in the first six months of the year. Scientists from the WWA say this was made at least 600 times more probable by human emissions.

Record flooding in the Sahel region of Africa affects 500,000 people. The White and Blue Nile burst banks. The average level of the Blue Nile reaches 17.43 metres (57.19ft), the highest since Sudan started measuring in 1912. Senegal records 124mm of rain over a seven-hour downpour – the amount that would usually be expected across the entire rainy season from July to September. Sudan imposes a three-month state of emergency on 4 September, after rains destroys about 100,000 houses and kills more than 100 people. In Nigeria, flooding damages 500,000 hectares of farm produce, amounting to about 5bn naira (£9.8m), according to NKC African Economics.

KAMPALA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- At least two children were killed by floods following heavy rains in the western Ugandan district of Rubanda on Saturday, police said here Sunday.

Elly Maate, the Kigezi regional police spokesperson in a statement, said two female juveniles were swept away by running water at Karengyere village, Muko Sub County, amid a heavy down pour.

""Police in Muko received information that two female juveniles were yesterday (Saturday) swept by running water amid heavy down pour. Bodies were retrieved pending postmortem,"" said Maate.

Several parts of the east African country, especially western and eastern regions, are currently experiencing normal to above normal rainfall, with destructive effects, according to the weather department.

In its March-May seasonal rainfall outlook, the Uganda National Meteorological Authority warned of enhanced rainfall over several parts of the country that could result into disasters such as landslides and foods, leading to loss of lives and destruction of property in the first major rain season.

Continuous rains and inflows from rivers around the Rwenzori region are responsible for the rising water levels in Lake Albert and flooding of surrounding areas.



The floods have devastated several areas in Ntoroko district, where more than 70,000 people are living in camps in Kanara Sub-county, 1,300 homes are abandoned and uncountable properties destroyed.



Jaconius Musingwire, the Western Region Manager of the National Environment Management Authority -NEMA observes that heavy water inflows especially from rivers streaming out of the Rwenzori mountains have significantly increased the water volumes in Lake Albert.



The situation, he says, has been worsened by silt that has been carried down into the lake raising the water levels. Musingwire says there is a need for a multi-sectoral approach to deal with environmental degradation in the region which has left the earth clear of natural vegetation cover.



//Cue in; “That water no longer…

Meanwhile, Ntoroko district administration needs at least 4 billion Shillings to resettle flood victims displaced by the rising water levels. In an interaction with a URN, the flood victims appealed to the government to resettle them anticipating that the floods may not rescind soon.



Ben Muthahinga, the acting District Chairperson says the money will be used to construct temporary resettlement structures, pit latrines, installation of water tanks and boreholes.","Fri, 23 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://ugandaradionetwork.net/a/helpers/image.php?fileId=230894&m=0&w=960&h=960,"['rwenzori', 'uganda', 'albert', 'mountainsnema', 'subcounty', 'l', 'floods', 'levels', 'inflows', 'district', 'region', 'uncountable', 'fed', 'radionetwork', 'ntoroko', 'lake', 'victims', 'water', 'heavy']",

Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) has significantly dealt with the challenge of flooding in the City.

A year ago, Kampala was experiencing floods at certain black spots that made navigation at those points impossible to go past for several hours after a downpour.

These locations included; Clock Tower on Entebbe Road that often covered the Fire Brigade headquarters parking; Mulwana Road in Bugoloobi Parish; at the Electoral Commission head office on Jinja Road; and the Bwaise communities in Kawempe Division. The floods disrupted navigation in the city, damaged both business and household property as well as affecting livelihoods in vulnerable communities.

KCCA embarked on an aggressive drainage infrastructure development programme in line with the Kampala Drainage Master Plan (KDMP) and the Kampala Capital City Strategic Plan 2020/2021-2024/2025 whose strategic goal is that “by June 2025 Kampala will be an inclusive, liveable, resilient and well planned city that provides economic opportunities to all”. The strategic plan is anchored on four pillars; Economic growth, governance and citizen engagement, quality of life and city resilience.

Some of the projects done or in progress include the construction of the Lubigi and Nakamiro channels with a combined stretch of 5.88Km at Shs82.7B launched in August 2020 by President Museveni. The two channels will solve the flood water menace in the low lying areas of Bwaise, stretching into Kawala in Rubaga Division.

The Clock Tower area and Mulwana Road flooding has been significantly dealt with by downstream interventions on Nakivubo Channel in the Kanyogoga swamp catchment area in Makindye and Nakawa divisions.

Here KCCA is desilting and widening the channel by removing gravel and other sediments that affect the breadth, depth and flow of water. The box culvert constructed on Mulwana Road plus widening and constructing the open drain that feeds into Nakivubo channel is already proving that the area shall be floodless when works are completed. The drainage works under the Kampala Flyover Project are to further solve the stagnation challenge at Clock Tower.

Other drainage improvement works including construction of St Dennis Channel that flows through Kulekana and Nakinyuguzi Channel in Salaama Parish, both in Makindye Division. In Central Division, KCCA is working on Kitamanya’agamba drain (below the Law Development Centre) in Kagugube Parish. In Rubaga Division, Nabulagala Channel and the box culvert along Sentema Road have been constructed, hence mitigating the flooding incidences.

Also in Rubaga Division, interim interventions on sections of Nalukolongo Primary Channel are ahead of the planned reconstruction once funds are obtained for both the channel works and remaining compensation of persons.

One of the key challenges affecting the efficiency of drainage channels is garbage. There is a lot of irresponsible dumping of garbage (polythene, plastic bottles and trade refuse) that ends up blocking the drainage system once it is swept away by surface water run-off or when dumped in the channels causing surface runoff build up and stagnation (floods). Whereas KCCA has emergency teams at the drainage channels during the rain, we appeal to the public to responsibly manage waste.

Another challenge is the illegal developments and encroachments on drainage reserves of primary and secondary channels. Some developers have constructed over the drains while others have illegally diverted the course of drainage channels. Consequently, the capacity of these drains has decreased and maintenance affected resulting in flooding as seen in Bugolobi, Nalukolongo Kamwokya, and Kansanga areas.

The KDMP was developed to improve the old, dilapidated and inefficient existing drainage systems. It recommends both structural and non-structural measures.

Sorting out Kampala’s drainage challenges may not be a fortnight or season’s work but great strides have been taken for one to confidently note that the floods are no more in Kampala, save for the temporal stagnation that usually clears within 10 to 15 minutes after a heavy downpour.

Traffic and business came to a standstill on Wednesday following a heavy downpour in Kampala.



The most affected roads were John Babiiha road where road construction works are on-going and Kyaggwe Road near Swaminarayan Temple. People with businesses along Kyaggwe road were forced to close after water entered their shops.



Business at Ham Shopping Grounds also came to a standstill as Nakivubo Channel overflowed and left the shops submerged in water.



The floods flowing from Clock Tower to Nakivubo Channel submerged the road making it nearly impassable for pedestrians and small cars. Some people were forced to remove their shoes, fold their trousers and wade through the floodwaters.



Some men were seen charging 1,000 shillings to carry pedestrians who didn't want to wade through the water, on their backs.



This isn't the first time Clock Tower is flooding. Various attempts have been made in vain to improve the drainage and ease the water flow.



Brian Bagala, an Engineer in charge of drainage at Kampala Capital City Authority-KCCA says the Clock Tower is bound to flood especially now that the area is excavated as works continue under the Kampala Fly Over project. He says as works proceed, some of the drainages in the area has been affected.



He, however, says the status will improve when the Flyover Project is concluded and the drainage in the area is worked upon.



//Cue in: ""When a development...""



Cue out: ""...to be there""//



The Nakibubo Channel is the converging area for storm-water in the Central Business area. Over 500 manholes are placed in the City leading storm-water into Nakivubo Channel. However, the channel is overwhelmed due to the grounding erection of buildings that have taken up the green spaces that could accommodate water.



In 2019, with funding from World Bank under the Kampala Institutional Infrastructure Development Project, KCCA contracted a consultant company, Nippon Engineering to study the channel and conduct an assessment, modelling and redesigning of the catchment area.



The consultant was supposed to conclude works by this month but Bagala says their activities were interrupted by COVID -19 Lockdown and were hence granted more time until December 2020.

70,70,FL-2019-000066-UGA,Heavy rains may mar quality of Ugandan coffee crop: official - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-coffee-idUSKBN2330PZ,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - The quality of Uganda’s coffee crop may decline in the coming months as heavy rains across the east African nation have reduced the amount of sunshine necessary for bean drying, an industry official told Reuters on Wednesday.

Uganda is Africa’s largest exporter of coffee followed by Ethiopia and grows mostly robusta variety.

The country has been pounded by unusually heavy rains that started in August resulting in deaths, displacement and extensive damage to roads and other infrastructure.

Western Uganda, including the foothills of the Rwenzori mountains that are among the biggest coffee growing areas, has received some of the most intense rains.

“The drying process is a major problem in most of the places...the weather is not good for drying,” David Muwonge, head of marketing at the National Union of Coffee Agribusiness and Farmer Enterprises (NUCAFE) told Reuters.

“There’s a higher risk of beans becoming mouldy unless farmers are well sensitised.”

Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA), the state-run regulator, forecasts Uganda’s bean exports will climb 16% to 5.1 million 60-kg (132-pound) bags in the current crop year ending September.

The country’s coffee output has surged in recent years, the fruition of a government programme that has been distributing free seedlings to farmers to expand acreage and replace aging trees.

Authorities say their target is to help boost annual production to 20 million bags by 2025.

The beans have traditionally been Uganda’s biggest commodity export but were recently overtaken by gold which now annually earns the country over $1 billion.

Muwonge said the damage to transport infrastructure by the rains and flooding was likely slow the flow of beans from farms and collection centres from some of the deep rural areas.","Tue, 26 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['drying', 'farmers', 'official', 'crop', 'quality', 'beans', 'million', 'coffee', 'damage', 'ugandan', 'rains', 'mar', 'ugandas', 'heavy', 'told']",

More than 1,000 families displaced by floods that ravaged Karusandara Sub County, Kasese district close to three months ago, are struggling to survive.



The families were displaced after the floods hit villages of Kivengenyi, Kabaka, Kanamba and Kyalanga in Karusandara Sub County following a heavy downpour that burst the banks of River Mubuku and Nyamwamba.



With no access to necessities, the families can hardly afford a meal a day. They accuse both government and the local leadership for deliberately refusing to address their plight.



The victims who include pregnant women, youth, children and the elderly are camped in nine IDPs spread across the sub-county.

Prices of maize at low levels due to adequate availabilities and depressed demand

Food security situation still affected by measures to contain spread of COVID‑19 pandemic, despite phasing out of some restrictions

Above-average 2020 second season cereal harvest expected in bi‑modal rainfall areas

In bi‑modal rainfall areas covering most of the country, harvesting of the 2020 second season crops is about to start and will be completed in January. The September‑November rainy season was characterized by abundant precipitations, especially in northern areas, favouring crop establishment and development. Vegetation conditions are good across the country (see ASI map) and an above-average crop production is expected. However, the torrential rains triggered flooding in September and October near Lake Albert and Lake Kyoga, in northwestern Amuru, Adjumani, Obongi, Packwach, Moyo, Lamwo and Arua districts and in eastern Butaleja and Mbale districts. In addition, landslides occurred in mountain areas of eastern Mbale, southern Kisoro and western Bunyangabo districts. Floods and landslides affected about 16 500 people and caused losses of lives, damage to infrastructure and localized crop losses. Subsequently, in late November, heavy rains caused floods in Mbarara District and landslides in Kasese District, both located in the South-Western Region, affecting more than 2 000 people.

The first season harvest concluded in July and production was estimated at above‑average levels due to abundant seasonal rains, despite localized but significant flood-related production shortfalls.

Total cereal production for 2020 is put at about 3.6 million tonnes, nearly 4 percent up from 2019 and similar to the average of the previous five years.

In February 2020, a desert locust outbreak affected northeastern Teso and Karamoja subregions and northern Acholi and Lango subregions. Damage to pastures and crops was localized as swarms were of relatively small size and the Government, with the support of FAO, carried out effective control operations. Although as of late November no swarms were present in the country, Cyclone Gati hit northern Somalia on 22 November 2020 bringing heavy rains and creating a conducive environment for the formation of several immature swarms in early December. Some of these swarms could reach northern Kenya by mid‑December. As a result, there is a concrete risk of another locust invasion of northeastern and northern areas of the country, characterized by an already fragile food security situation. The desert locust response plan is 90 percent funded through multiple donors and agencies, and contingency plans are in place for surveillance and control measures.

Delayed and reduced harvest gathered in Karamoja Region

In the uni‑modal rainfall agro‑pastoral Karamoja Region, the April‑September rainy season had an early onset in March, with heavy rains triggering flooding and waterlogging which resulted in delayed and reduced plantings, also due to seed shortages. As a result, although the good performance of seasonal rains benefitted yields, cereals and pulses were harvested in October, with about a one‑month delay, and production is estimated at 10‑20 percent below average due to a reduced planted area and to the continuation of seasonal rains into October, which resulted in increased post-harvest losses.

Abundant seasonal rains benefitting pastoral livelihoods

In the agro‑pastoral areas of Cattle Corridor and Karamoja Region, abundant rains between September and November have resulted in above‑average rangeland conditions (see Vegetation Condition Index Map). Ample availability of water and pasture benefitted animal body conditions, with above‑average levels of meat and milk production. However, in Cattle Corridor significant losses of pasture due to floods have been reported in western Ntoroko and Bullisa districts and in central Nakasongola District. In Karamoja Region, the restrictive measures introduced to curb the spread of the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and the COVID‑19 pandemic, coupled with persisting insecurity related to cattle raids, have disrupted livestock movements and, animal and milk sales.

Prices of maize at low levels due to adequate availabilities and depressed demand

Prices of maize decreased by about 50 percent between May and August in all monitored markets, including the capital, Kampala, as the commercialization of the first season harvest increased market availabilities. The COVID‑19‑related restrictions exerted further downward pressure on prices, as demand by restaurants, hotels, schools and urban households was constrained by a lower economic activity and declines in incomes. Prices increased by about 15‑20 percent in September, as seasonal patterns were compounded by flood‑related trade disruptions, remaining subsequently mostly stable in October and November. Prices of maize in November were almost 40 percent below their year‑earlier levels.

In the cereal deficit Karamoja Region, the availability of low priced cereals from neighbouring surplus producing areas in Soroti, Lira and Acholi regions has resulted in a generalized decline of cereal prices, despite the below‑average local harvest. In several markets of the region, including Moroto, Kaabong and Napak, prices of sorghum in September were up to 20 percent below their year‑earlier levels.

Food security situation affected by measures adopted to contain spread of COVID‑19 pandemic

The restrictive measures introduced in March and April 2020 by the Government to curb the spread of the COVID‑19 pandemic had a substantial adverse impact on the food security situation. Despite the easing of restrictions in June/July, the economic and livelihood recovery has been slow.

According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, conducted in Karamoja Region, refugee settlements, host communities and urban areas, 2 million people (17 percent of the analyzed population) are estimated to be severely food insecure (IPC Phase 3: “Crisis” and Phase 4: “Emergency”) in the period September 2020-January 2021. Of these 2 million people:","Wed, 09 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1547789-UGA.png?itok=EdDjwioV,"['seasonal', 'season', 'brief', '9december2020', 'giews', '2020', 'areas', 'security', 'region', 'karamoja', 'rains', 'country', 'uganda', 'production', 'harvest']",

KEY MESSAGES

After an early onset, the March to May rainfall season peaked in late April and early May. Torrential rain caused floods in the Lake Victoria basin, major river basins, and low-lying flood-prone areas. At least 845,000 people were displaced across the Horn, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, according to data available from OCHA and country governments.

The rainfall season began to subside by mid-May, marking an earlier-than-normal end to the season in some short rains- and Gudependent areas of the Horn and an atypical dry spell in parts of Uganda. Dry and hot conditions are expected in bimodal areas of the Horn until the onset of the short rains/Deyr rains in late September/October.

Rangeland conditions remain exceptionally favorable in most bimodal areas. However, crop production prospects in eastern and southeastern Kenya, southern and northwestern Somalia, southwestern Ethiopia, parts of Uganda, and southeastern South Sudan are being closely monitored due to the mixed effects of heavy rainfall and floods, early end of season, and desert locusts.","Sat, 13 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1522366-EAST_AFRICA_Seasonal_Monitor_2020_06_07_final.png?itok=o2uM5OJJ,"['africa', 'seasonal', 'season', 'rainfall', '2020', 'areas', 'parts', 'east', 'horn', 'early', 'short', 'monitor', 'southeastern', 'rains', 'world', 'uganda', '12']",

SPRINGFIELD - Water continues to rise in some parts of Livingston Parish as Tropical Depression Beta brews in the Gulf.

The storm surge produced wind speeds up 30 mph, causing flooding along the immediate coasts of the Gulf, Lake Maurepas and Lake Pontchartrain. Livingston Parish officials say the water has risen a few feet in just 24 hours.

Along the Tickfaw River, you can find high water signs, roadways submerged in water, and businesses that were forced to close because of the flooding.

Cameron Ferachi, a resident in the Terry Harbor neighborhood, says it floods every time a storm comes their way.

""I need a boat to get to and from my truck,"" Ferachi said.

Ferachi's camp sits at the end of a flooded road. To avoid pushing water into homes or damage to his vehicle, he and his best friend Mike have come up with a solution. They kayak to and from their trucks, which are parked at the end of the street.

Paddling up and down the roads they usually travel down in a vehicle is not a situation they're excited to be in.

""When the water comes up, you get people out here sightseeing, pushing water in front of everybody. It really sucks,"" Ferachi said.

These conditions are so inconvenient for some locals, like Ferachi, that they plan to move away.

""I'm actually moving Oct. 13 to get away from the flooding. I can't deal with it anymore,"" Ferachi said from his kayak.

In the meantime, flash flood warnings and advisories remain active in the area through Wednesday, Sept. 23.

Livingston Parish officials say they will continue to monitor the area. If you are in need of sand or sandbags, supplies are available at your local fire department.

As we conclude the celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, lets remind ourselves about cities across the globe that have been designed to embrace livable and sustainable human settlement while putting a comparison with Uganda’s capital that poses as a flopped state seeking emergence renaissance. A ‘1.7 million people City’ seated on 189 square kilometers gives an average density of 8994 persons per square kilometer approximately (UBOS data 2019), with numerous hills and beautiful sceneries that have attracted the largest number of Ugandan elites.

The uncontrolled organic urban development taking pace on the look of urban authorities that has rendered ex-green belts, swamps and public harbours susceptible to a risk of being eaten up by human activities. The increasing land value in the city centre is sending away the urban poor and directing them to settling in wetlands and other protected areas due to lack of alternatives.

Kampala has for a longtime proved to be a city with imbalances between population growth and settlement patterns. It is a place of sarcastic and adverse urban development, city-wide decay and low rate of response to emergencies. Pavements and rooftops mean that less rainwater can soak into the ground. The pattern of streets and buildings has interrupted some of the natural drainage ways and reduced the width of some channels. As a result, more water runs off more quickly, and the drainage system has often become overloaded.

The city is majorly challenged with lack of hydraulic and hydrological-related data where it has failed to manage a clear record of its rainfall amounts, wetland distribution, drainage systems and general water flows data, uncontrolled urban expansion, abandoned buildings, illegal connections of sewage into the separate drainage network, and great amounts of sediments and organic matter which decrease the performance of the drainage facilities, lack of legal instruments and difficulty to approve new legislation, urban planning restrictions, institutional and political problems, opposition by the population, designers and public managers.

Additionally, it’s identified with overlooked scramble and partitioning of land within the wetlands hence bleeding with limited space for catchment of storm water. Land managers spearhead wetland destruction through personalisation and issuing of land titles in these vulnerable places.

The notion, “water is life” is gradually decelerating in the city centre since a dream of a heavy rain is a nightmare to many. The manner in which wetland resources have been depleted is a disgrace to the face of urban planning as a profession and provokes ridiculers into questioning the prevailing urban management systems. The massive erosion, silting of drainage channels, poor waste management as well as reclamation all contribute to this ‘city of floods.’

Natives interpret the status quo as a normal phenomenon that seasonally comes and goes, forgetting the long-term consequences that are left behind. People seem not to be bothered because after a flood wash, business resumes ordinarily.

The urban authority in-charge of the city alleges that it formulated a drainage master plan to curb the flood and its effects which has been challenged with limited funding and skilled workmanship. The drainage master plan that was formulated in 2003 was a way of directing storm water that increased steadily due to the reduction in the green spaces that have been pressurised by the ever-increasing population.

Until now its workability is questioned. This has overtime hyped the concern of many government bodies including the National Physical Planning Board that has responded by cautioning the city managers to take concern of the known flooding, housing and planning challenges to ensure improved livelihoods for the citizens. The challenges of excess storm water management in Kampala can be wrapped under one theme “lack of an operational and easily implementable urban and environmental master plan”.

In 2016, an Italian based consultancy firm specialised in water and land scape designing called “SGI Studio Galli Ingegneria” was contracted to review the 2003 Kampala Drainage Master Plan to check its operationability, its challenges and to pledge a way forward, a project that lasted for five months.

As a result, different additions were observed and taken onboard. It has also been noted with great concern that drainage has been given priority under KIIDP 2, a project that supports Kampala City improvement through world bank funding. However, it is ironical to say that with all such consideration, the drainage system has continued to smack as the biggest challenge that the ‘country’s capital’ battles with especially during a heavy rain.

The central government’s silence over the castrophe makes one to think that there is a ‘burning solution’ that is being planned indoors that is yet to be unveiled, only to hear tales. Kampala metropolitan is a home of numerous wetlands including Bwaise, Ndeeba, Katwe, Nakivubo, Namasuba among others but soon will be living in a shadow of its glamorous natural resources as more swamps continue to be reclaimed.

The city of floods is this town that has been built on wetlands without safeguards to stormwater/flooding and yet city buildings and infrastructure seat on former water catchment arenas. Therefore, city wide developments should be established in a manner that advocates for the wellbeing of natural resources, drainage channels should be reconstructed, waste should be properly disposed at household level, buildings close to drainage channels should have paved compounds as ways of controlling blockages in stormwater flow.

Management of a flood wash should be handled by respective risk management committees at local council level, maintain records of the people/areas affected and have constant checkups and monitoring tours within these sections but most importantly to utilize the use of a GIS system to predict future hazards.

Finally, the city authority must perceive the fact that people settling in these low-lying areas are to stay with the flood until our contemporary political and budgetary system support proper urban planning.

Enforcement of non-structural planning laws is particularly challenging due to the physically extensive informal housing in wetlands which is exacerbated by political, policy, and socioeconomic arrangements.

“There may not be enough time to prepare after you are notified of a flood watch…” (Boulder, 2002). Therefore, urban managers should also empower communities to maintain their drainage systems, through regular inspection and cleaning of drains, an important task that can be performed without specialized skills.

Mr Rahim Lubadde is a physical planner.

Leaders in Kikuube and Hoima districts are demanding the government to allocate part of Kabwoya Kaiso-Tonya Community Wildlife conservation area to resettle thousands of flood victims.



Kabwoya Kaiso-Tonya Community wildlife conservation area is situated in Kabwoya and Buseruka sub-counties in Hoima and Kikuube districts.



Over 20,000 people have been displaced by floods in the two districts of Hoima and Kikuube since March.



The most affected landing sites in Hoima are Tonya, Kijangi, Kaiso, Rwentali, Hoimo, Fofo, Mbegu, Waaki and Kiryamboga among others, while the affected areas in Kikuube include Nkondo, Sebigoro, Ususa, Senjojo, Wangjok, Busiki and Nsonga.



The flood victims have sought refuge in churches and schools while others are sleeping out in coldness under trees as the floods continue to ravage the area. Area leaders and the affected persons say the only option is to resettle them to the game reserve.



Peter Kyasimire a resident of Nkondo landing site in Kabwoya Sub County in Kikuube district says the government should consider the lives of the people and have them resettled.



//Cue in;”Abataka ba Nkondo…



Cue out: “…kyo kwi kara.”/



Joyce Akumu who was displaced by floods at Kaiso landing site says currently she is settling at Kaiso Primary School with her five children since she has nowhere to construct another house because her house was completely submerged by floods.



Rashid Sunday, a resident of Sebigoro landing site says he was hit hard by the floods that submerged his house and currently he has nowhere to go.



He wants the government to come to their rescue and allocate part of the Kabwoya-Kaiso-Tonya community wildlife conservation area to resettle them.

The Kabwoya Wildlife Reserve and the Kaiso-Tonya Community Wildlife Area were established following the revision of the protected area estate in Uganda in the late 1990s.



A decree of parliament in 2002 created the two protected areas from the former Kaiso Tonya Controlled Hunting area which had been gazetted in 1963.

The recent rains remind me of how poor our drainage system is. All you have to do is look at the roads every time it rains to know there is something fundamentally wrong with our infrastructure. And the most ridiculous thing about all this is that it has been happening since time immemorial. It is as if we are supposed to learn to live with the floods and normalise them. I have never travelled to other countries so I don’t know whether it is the same case elsewhere.

Do rain floods paralyse movement from one place to another in other countries too or is it just us? Do people have to be carried from one side of the road to another, do cars “drown” in mini rivers? And for those countries that have managed to solve this problem, how did they do it? Can we learn from them? What role can we all play in trying to create a clean and flood-free country?

I know for sure that if we followed a well-organised garbage dumping system, we would not have to deal with the consequences of a clogged drainage system. I also know that if we stopped settling in water catchment areas, we wouldn’t mess up the eco-system and the water would follow a natural drainage flow. What I don’t know is why we don’t do these things and yet continue to cry foul.

Every so often we wake up to huge factories built in what we all know to be swampy areas and yet we say nothing.

I wonder who we think will speak up for us. We have abused our environment way too much to expect any favours from nature.

There’s a song by the Swedish pop group, Ace of Bace titled, Everytime it rains. The chorus of that song says, “Cause every time it rains, I fall to pieces. So many memories the rain releases, I feel you, I taste you. I cannot forget. Every time it rains, I get wet”.

Well, here is a Ugandan rendition of those lines. “Every time it rains, Uganda falls to pieces. So much sewage and dirt and all manner of garbage the rain releases. We smell it, we are even doused in it, every time it rains.

Seriously though, we must do something about our drainage system and put an end to this man-made mess.

Despite rain reducing in most parts of the country, many others continue to experience devastating effects of floods.

The raging floods have claimed about 20 lives and left thousands homeless. The worst hit are eastern, northern and western parts of the country.

In western region, Kasese District has experienced back-to-back floods after five major rivers burst their banks, sweeping away homes, schools, hospitals, and churches.

The recent episode was on May 21 when rivers Thaku and Lhubiriha burst their banks near the Uganda-DR Congo border, killing eight people.

The Kasese District environment officer, Mr Augustine Kooli, said the rainfall pattern in the area was the highest in April and May more than any other time of the year.

“The district experiences a bimodal rainfall pattern. The first rains are short but fall with high intensity and occur between March and May, and the longer rains from August to November have a low intensity,” he explained.

He added: “Annual rainfall ranges from 800mm to 1,600mm and is greatly influenced by altitude. At the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains, the rainfall amount is between 1,200mm and 1,400mm.” Mr Kooli explained that under the District Integrated Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan 2017-2020, they encouraged the communities to plant trees on mountain slopes to reduce the runoff.

Western region

In Isingiro District, five people died in Kabuyanda Town Council and Kabuyanda Sub-county on May 2 following heavy rain, according to Isingiro South MP Alex Byarugaba.

The rain also triggered landslides and floods in the hilly area characterised by deep valleys. “We have always experienced these catastrophes but this time the impact was far too great; I had never seen this extent of damage by rains,” Mr Byarugaba said on Monday.

The floods and landslides destroyed houses, banana plantations, vegetable gardens, fishponds, roads and bridges.

Mr Byarugaba added that more than 800 households of between 4,000 and 5,000 people were affected in Kikagati and Kabuyanda Town Council, while bridges in Kaburara, Rwabisheri, Kabumba, and Kamwotsya were destroyed. “These are crossing points within these sub-counties, connecting health centres, schools and markets. People now can’t easily access these places. Local leaders have mobilized people who just worked on temporary measures for crossing,” he remarks.

In Kanungu District, the area vice chairman, Mr Gad Byomuhangi, on Monday said most roads and bridges were destroyed by rain and yet they do not have money to work on them.

The Kisoro District chairperson, Mr Abel Bizimana, said Rubuguri-Katojo road was cut off after Rushaga Bridge was washed away by floods.

He added that Ruhezamyenda Bridge that connects Rubuguri-Kisoro Town road was also washed away and local people have resorted to using community paths to connect to either side.

In eastern Uganda, floods mostly hit Manafwa, Kween, Bududa, Sironko, Pallisa, Butaleja, and Bukedea districts.

In Pallisa, more than 30 families were displaced at the beginning of the month after floods swept away their homes and gardens.

In Kween District, landslides killed three people and displaced about 50 families in Chepsukunya Town Council and Ngenge Sub-county.

In Budaka District, hundreds are stranded with nowhere to sleep after a heavy storm hit several villages.

Northern region

In Lango Sub-region, more than 350 households in Apac District have been left homeless.

The affected are residents of Acholi Inn Landing Site, Kayei Landing Site, Wansolo Landing Site, and Kampala Kagoi, all in Akokoro Sub-county.

The flash floods also affected residents of Aganga, Tarogali and Alworoeng parishes in Ibuje Sub-county.

Overflowing water from Lake Kyoga and River Nile is currently invading dry land along the shorelines every day, submerging homes and gardens of crops.

The Apac Resident District Commissioner (RDC), Ms Beatrice Akello Akori, said a team from the district visited the affected areas last week to assess the damage and is compiling a report that will be sent to the Office of the Prime Minister. “We are looking at resettling them at Maruzi Ranch but these people are very tricky; once you give them land, they don’t want to leave it,” she said.

In Busoga Sub-region, increasing water levels on Lake Victoria have displaced about 4,000 residents at Masese Landing Site, Rippon and Gomba, all in Jinja Municipal Council.

The councillor representing Masese at Jinja Municipal Council, Mr Ronald Katongole, said there is a need to relocate all people at Masese Landing site. “We (local leaders) have tried to do what is necessary to ensure that people are safe but due to this pandemic, sometimes people turn violent that implementing some of the health directives is challenging,” he said.

Central region

In Masaka District, increasing water levels at landing sites on Lake Victoria shoreline have started extending to villages, sparking fear among residents.

By last week, the floods had swept through Makonzi Parish, Bukakata Sub-county, displacing 450 households across five villages of Kasaka, Bwami, Bukoko, Kisuku and Makonzi .

The floods first submerged the landing sites of Lambu, Kaziru, Kisuku, Malembo and Kachanga, forcing about 20,000 people to relocate to safer places on the mainland where they have since set up makeshift houses.

Although government has extended them some relief assistance such as food and tarpaulins, the victims are still in dire need of more humanitarian assistance.

Bukakkata Sub-county chairperson Aloysius Jjuko said no deaths have been recorded though residents are at high risk of contracting water -borne diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera and Hepatitis A due to the deteriorating sanitation situation in the area.

“Our focus has been on those displaced from landing sites but the problem has escalated, residents have lost houses and crops and government should assist them as well,” he said The Resident District Commissioner, Mr Herman Ssentongo, said area leaders have been tasked to identify free government land where victims can permanently be resettled. “This tragedy is unprecedented and as government we cannot leave our people to continue suffering; a lasting solution has to be found,” he said.

Kalangala cut off

In Kalangala, flash floods have also caused similar havoc, cutting off three landing sites and separating them from the main Bugala Island. The affected landing sites are Kaazi-Malanga, Mukalanga and Kasamba in Bujumba Sub-county.

Access to the three landing sites from Bugala Island has been by road but currently, residents have to use boats to connect to the area. Mr Federico Ssekatawa, the chairperson Kaazi- Malanga Village, said life on the ‘new island’ has become very difficult as residents lack food, clean water and medical supplies.

Currently, an estimated 7,500 residents in the area have no access to electricity supply after the devastating floods forced the service provider, Kalangala Infrastructure Services, to disconnect power lines to avoid electrocution.

• Torrential rains are being experienced across Uganda. According to the Uganda National Meteorological Department (UNMA), abovenormal rains will continue until the end of the year.

• At least 38 people have died due to floods and landslides in Bundibugyo, Bududa and Sironko districts, and over 150 people have been injured. At least 300,000 have been affected and an estimated 65,000 people are displaced, according to Government sources.

• The floods and landslides have left a trail of destruction, including damaged homes, infrastructure, agriculture and livelihoods.

• The Government of Uganda, with the support of humanitarian partners, is responding to the most urgent needs of people affected.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

Due to heavier than normal rains since September—enhanced by the positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)—several districts in Uganda have been experiencing flash floods (mostly in urban areas) and landslides (in rural/hilly areas).

According to preliminary estimates from a rapid assessment conducted by the Office of the Prime Minister in the most affected sub-regions of Mount Elgon and South Western Uganda in early December, at least 300,000 people have been affected, including 65,000 people reportedly displaced by the impact of heavy rains since September 2019. Over 21,500 hectares of crop and plantations are reportedly damaged in these areas. As of 17 December, 38 people have reportedly lost their lives, including in the mountainous Bundibugyo district in the western region and the Mount Elgon area in eastern Uganda. Water systems in Bundibugyo have been destroyed, exacerbating the risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases. In the week of 16 December, three suspected cholera cases were reported in Bundibugyo district. However, they tested negative and there have been no confirmed cholera cases since November 2019, according to the Ministry of Health and WHO.

In the eastern lowland sub-regions of Teso and Bukedea sub-regions, thousands of people have been affected and hectares of crops destroyed.

The East African Community (EAC) Council of Ministers suggests Uganda may have breached the agreements on how much water to release from Nalubaale dam — the main outlet of the world’s largest freshwater lake.

Lake Victoria flows into River Nile, with the dam being one of the two major outlets.

Documents filed at the EAC Council of Ministers say Uganda has refused to execute a new policy governing the release of water in Jinja, a decision that has led to flooding of the lake that could claim more lives and cause destruction.

The council ordered EAC member states to implement the policy in 2012, but over four years, despite protests by Uganda.

Kenya, Tanzania and Burundi voted for its implementation at a Council of Ministers meeting that year.

Uganda insists that the policy, which determines volumes of water to be released based on Lake Victoria levels, cannot be implemented as it does not take into consideration several factors, like extraction in the affected countries.

Life and death

The policy is yet to be implemented. “The 26th EAC Council of Ministers directive on the policy has taken more than four years to implement, not only by Uganda, but also by the partner state,” Uganda says in its appeal to the council.

“Studies that had been directed to be completed by November 2014 have never started. Uganda is, therefore, of the view that the policy cannot be implemented and needs review.”

Nalubaale dam was built as part of a hydropower station in Jinja after Uganda and Egypt signed agreements that the East African country would not do anything to interfere with the flow of the Nile, the world’s longest river.

However, power station operators have, over the years, increased or reduced the volumes of water flowing from the lake based on how much is needed to meet the East African country’s electricity demand.

The release of too much water means Lake Victoria’s depth will decrease, a situation blamed on drought for many years.

Releasing less water means the level of the lake increases and could lead to floods in towns and villages surrounding it.

Floods killed at least six people and displaced 32,000 in Kisumu County and its environs in April and May. Ugandan authorities want the original natural flow out of the lake maintained.

The regional bloc ordered implementation of the schedule after it emerged that Uganda had been violating agreements to maintain the natural Lake Victoria outflow volumes before Nalubaale dam was built.

Mitigation measures

Uganda says the studies that led to the policy failed to consider major water extractions in the three countries.

It adds that the EAC Council of Ministers ordered the implementation of the policy before more data and information on water extraction in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania had been collected, yet that was recommended by experts whose reports were used in formulating it.

“The developed and adopted blueprint is therefore only a release policy and not a release and abstraction one,” Uganda says in its appeal.

“Potential impacts of the policy in Lake Victoria Basin countries as well as downstream states was not carried out to provide mitigation measures for a win-win situation as directed by the Council of Ministers.”

“Uganda has more than 600 kilometres of River Nile across her territory that includes lakes Kyoga and Albert. It has made significant developments based on the agreed curve policy that came into existence in 1954, which will be affected by the new water release and abstraction policy.”

The construction of Nalubaale hydroelectric power station in 1954 provided a reliable source of electricity for Uganda, but the decision has come to haunt hundreds of thousands of families living around the lake.

Before the construction of Nalubaale, the Owen and Ripon waterfalls were the main links between Lake Victoria and the Nile.

The waterfalls also acted as a natural tap, controlling the Nile and Lake Victoria outflows. After signing the agreements with Egypt, Uganda built Owen Falls dam, later renamed Nalubaale.

Preparations for building the giant dam and power station meant that Ripon Falls was to be excavated.

Moderating factor

Eventually, Nalubaale was submerged but Ripon Falls remained.

But as Uganda celebrated its increased electricity supply capacity, it was the beginning of problems for millions of people around areas touched by the lake in the three countries.

Since the commissioning of Nalubaale in 1959, its operators have either increased or reduced Lake Victoria outflows, depending on volumes required for the production of electricity.

When more water is needed to meet growing power demands, operators allow more water to flow out of Victoria, which in turn leads to lower levels in the lake.

Whenever rain falls heavily, Nalubaale has sufficient water. It means less water is released, increasing levels in Lake Victoria in turn.

To increase power production and utilise excess water spills from Nalubaale, Uganda built another dam called Kiira just a kilometre away. President Yoweri Museveni commissioned it in 2003.

In 2005, World Bank senior disaster risk management specialist Daniel Kull led a study that showed that Uganda released more than 50 per cent of the allowed water volumes from Nalubaale and Kiira dams over the previous two years.

Fish population

Mr Kull’s team also found that the drastic fall in Lake Victoria water levels at the time was more as a result of the releases in Jinja than drought as had been widely believed.

“Based on the results of this analysis, it must be concluded that the severe Lake Victoria drops occurring in 2004 and 2005 were about 45 per cent due to drought and 55 per cent due to over-releases from Nalubaale and Kiira dams,” the World Bank disaster risk specialist’s report said.

It added that the rains that followed could not raise the levels of the lake, which was partial evidence that water release had more impact that drought.

Nalubaale dam is operated by Eskom Uganda Ltd — a subsidiary of South Africa’s state-owned Eskom Holdings Ltd.

Eskom has been spilling large volumes of water from Nalubaale and Kiira dams between February and May. The water reached its peak limits after the heavier-than-normal rainfall, leading to floods.

The effects of water releases go beyond flooding. When the water level in the lake drops, it affects the fish population.

As marine creatures move inwards to deeper waters, fishermen follow them. They at times get arrested after ending up in Uganda or Tanzania.

At least 70 Kenyan fishermen were arrested after crossing into Uganda between May and October last year.

They were released after paying heavy fines. Others had their boats confiscated. Some complained of being tortured and beaten by Ugandan security officials.","Fri, 22 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.monitor.co.ug/resource/blob/1891214/b3b31c7a34adabef0a3b28da04b1f481/latest07pix-data.jpg,"['lake', 'policy', 'releasing', 'dam', 'council', 'lvictoria', 'floods', 'uganda', 'water', 'release', 'volumes', 'ugandas', 'nalubaale', 'victoria', 'blamed']",

The continuous rising water level in Lake Kwania has forced thousands of people in Dokolo district from their homes. The water has submerged several homes and gardens over the past three months forcing residents to take shelter in schools, churches and community facilities.



More than 5000 households have been affected in different Sub Counties in Dokolo District. Agwata, Adok, Adeknino and Kwera sub counties are the most affected where the water levels seem to be increasing each day. At least 166 households have been displaced in Agwata Sub County.



The affected families have temporarily moved in with their relatives or friends while others are renting in areas that are not affected by the flooding. At least 20 households have taken shelter at Kachung Junior, a private Primary school.



However, their biggest challenge is lack of clean drinking water. The families are currently depending on the flood water for drinking and domestic chores since the only borehole at the school has been dysfunctional for the past five months. They are also forced to share classrooms and open dormitories.



John Obel, a resident of Kachung Western Ward, says the area is flooded to the point that all their feet is rotting. He says their need small canoes to navigate the area.

Musa Ecweru, minister of state for relief and disaster preparedness, told Xinhua by telephone that torrential rains which started last month, marking the first major rainfall season in the country, have displaced people, destroyed homes, farms, washed away roads and other infrastructure.

He said most of the affected areas include the mountainous and hilly areas in eastern and western Uganda, low lying and plain areas in eastern region.

“This problem is across the whole country. Now there are thousands of people who are displaced. The officers in my office are compiling the figures (numbers of people) and extent of damage for each district across Uganda,” said Ecweru.

“We are going to sit down and see how to handle the magnitude of the problem. We shall see how to dispatch some support to the affected persons,” he said.

The Office of the Prime Minister has been running alert messages, warning that the country will face floods, landslides, strong winds and lightning as the first rain season peaks.

“We have been running alert messages on televisions and radios. These alerts started running about five months ago. We have been telling and warning the country of heavy rains and its dangerous effects,” said Ecweru.

He said landslides have hit the hilly western district of Kabale.

Ecweru said people living in mountainous areas, flood prone areas as well as wetlands should immediately vacate to safe places as heavy rains continue.

At least two children were killed by floods following heavy rains in the western district of Rubanda on Saturday, according to police.

According to the weather department, several parts of the country especially western and eastern regions, are currently experiencing normal to above normal rainfall, with destructive effects.

More than 150 families in Dei A Village, Panyimur Sub-county in Pakwach District are homeless after their houses were submerged following the rising water levels of Lake Albert.

Mr Nicholas Opar, the village chairperson, said the floods destroyed several houses and washed away crops.

The most affected communities are mainly fishermen from Singla Market, Kayonga and Wangkado in Panyimur Sub-county.

Mr Opar said most of the affected families were temporarily hosted by their relatives while others have sought refuge in nearby government primary schools.

“We are living in fear and anticipate a possible cholera and typhoid outbreak among others that may affect the community who live near the Nile and have occasionally been using the lake as their water source for domestic purposes,” he said.

Mr Shaban Ofoy, the sub-county chairperson, said the situation could create a food crisis in the area.

“We anticipate hunger because huge acres of gardens with crops were washed away,” Mr Kinobe said. He said they had previously warned the communities against settling in the wetlands but they have been hesitant to adhere to the directives because they had no place to relocate to.

Mr Robert Omito, the district chairperson, appealed to government and well-wishers for relief.

“We have notified the [Ministry] of Relief, Disaster and Preparedness, and Uganda Red Cross regional office to assess the level of devastation and come to our rescue urgently and attend to the village,” Mr Omito said.

He added that said since most of the affected families mainly rely on fishing as source of their livelihood, there is urgent need of relief supplies such as food, tents and blankets to temporarily settle the affected families.

In December last year, floods cut off Pakwach-Karuma road, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded. The Uganda National Meteorology Authority, in its “seasonal rainfall outlook for March to May 2020,” warned that there would be an overall increased likelihood of near normal to above normal (wetter than average) rainfall in several parts of the country. Floods have also ravaged other districts, including Kasese, Ntoroko, Bundibugyo, Kabale, Ntungamo and Isingiro.

91,91,FL-2019-000066-UGA,Vanessa Nakate: 'Many people are not yet aware of the dangers of climate change' - DW (English),https://www.dw.com/en/fridays-for-future-uganda-climate-change-africa-activism-food-security-water/a-54732304,"From Uganda and in her early 20s, Vanessa Nakate started protesting against climate inaction outside the Ugandan government gates in 2019. She's on a mission to raise awareness about the issue within Africa and internationally because she has seen the impacts of climate change already on her own community.

DW: When you started Fridays for Future activism in Uganda, you were very much alone right at the beginning. At what point did you think, 'OK, I should continue this or I'm going to give up'?

Vanessa Nakate: I just felt like I had to continue striking, especially because I was still doing it by myself. But then as time went on, more and more people started to get involved in different parts of the country doing the climate strikes. And also in the entire African continent, more activists started coming up and doing the climate strikes and demanding action. And to me, that is enough of a motivation to keep me doing activism, knowing that I am not doing it alone, and that there are millions of young people from different parts of the world striking and demanding climate action.

How does climate activism in your country differ from what it looks like in Europe? We're used to seeing big Fridays For Future strikes here, but what does it look like in Uganda?

Well, of course there is a big difference between the activism in Uganda and in Europe. This is mainly because of two things.

One is awareness. Many people are not yet aware of the dangers. They don't have the facts. They don't have the clear science about what is happening when it comes to the climate crisis.

And then the other thing is freedom of expression. Freedom of expression is not the same as we see it is in Europe and it's also harder for students here to walk out of school and do the climate strikes.

If I want to do climate strikes with students, I have to go in the schools because many of them, they have a fear of walking out of school. Just walking out would subject you to either suspension or expulsion.

Also getting permits for marches every Friday is very hard, especially if you don't have a strong organization that is behind you, that is supporting you. So activism in my country — or probably in any other African country — is different because of such restrictions.

With that in mind, how do you get people motivated to go on strikes?

By sharing on social media. That is — mainly on Twitter and Facebook — I would share my strikes every Friday and many people would ask questions about what I was doing and why I was doing that.

The other way is going into schools and requesting principals, director of schools to talk to students on Friday so that I get to discuss with them the challenges that our planet faces and their role in securing a better future.

One other way, we've been doing community reach-outs where we go to local communities and do cleanups, because most of these people, they don't have access maybe to a television. They don't watch the news. They don't know the challenges that the world is facing. So through these local reach-outs or doing cleanups, we get to speak to them, we get to explain to them how they can protect the planet, what they can do for our home, because all of us have a responsibility to play.

The Global Strike 4 Climate in Uganda's capital Kampala in 2019

Climate change is obviously a difficult thing to explain to anybody in the world. But for you, what are the main issues locally that you are dealing with?

I have clearly seen the danger that climate change places on people's lives and the danger is mainly an issue of food scarcity and water scarcity for people.

A large percentage of the people in Uganda are heavily dependent on agriculture as a source of survival, and that is mainly the people in the rural communities. It also affects those in the urban centers because they get food from the rural communities. It also brings about other problems of seeing more street children on the streets of Kampala. This is because many of them, they're trying to run away from their lands. They're trying to find a better way of survival.

Also, availability of access to clean water for the people, because when it floods, that means the water will still be contaminated. It's submerged even toilets, not just the farms, it also submerged drainage. That means any water source that the community was relying on was also contaminated by the dirt from the toilets. So you find that, even in the flood there is a water scarcity.

You, as well as I guess your colleagues one could call them from Europe, have a whole set of different agendas regarding what issues are important within Europe, as opposed to what is important across Africa or Asia. Has it ever been difficult working with them?

No. I believe in a way, yes, the demands are different, the urgency is different — when it comes to Europe, it isn't as urgent as it is in Africa with the climate crisis. So in Europe, you find that most of the activists, they are mainly targeting the politicians and the leaders in making decisions that will ensure that different parts of the world are protected, that will ensure that the Earth is protected.

Vanessa Nakate with fellow Fridays For Future activists Shari Crespi of Spain (left) and Greta Thunberg (center) at a press conference during the COP25 summit in Madrid in 2019

I personally may not have reach to the leaders who determine the existence of the fossil fuel industry, who determine whether we are going to transition to a more sustainable future. Most of those leaders, they have so much influence as well in some of the countries on the African continent. So I feel like if they're able to reach out to those leaders in the European Parliament and put pressure on them to take the decisions that would save our planet, that also helps me out, that also helps the people of my country.

As you point out, places across Africa, whether it's the Sahel, whether it's the coastal areas, they have much more to lose than what we see in Europe. But for you, how does this make you feel when you can see that Africans are actually in a more dangerous position than the Europeans are, but that Africans have so little influence on that?

As a climate activist, of course, I understand that we have tried so much to ask for representation of every activist on the world stage, in discussions. But it is one thing to see that representation, but it's another thing for that representation to carry the same weight.

The weight of influence — it is not the same. The question is: Will they listen to what I will say? Will they find it important if I say it? What if I say the same thing today and no one pays attention to it and another activist from Europe says the same thing and it's given much attention?

What's your message to people across Africa about climate? No pressure.

For the people of Africa, no one is going to fight for you when it comes to the climate crisis.

If Africa experiences issues with the climate crisis, many times, we first look out for international media to talk about it. But now we need African media.

We can only save our continent if we work together. And unfortunately, it's not something that we are seeing right now.

Recently, you've actually been tweeting in German to try and get the message across. What made you do this?

Well, I did that because I was really angry and disturbed by the fact that Germany chose to push coal to 2038. I feel like that helps them and that doesn't help communities that are already being affected by the climate crisis. I feel like 2038 is too late. It's unnecessary and very dangerous for communities that are already facing devastating impacts of climate change.

So tweeting in German was a message to Germany, to the entire world. It was a message saying: 'I am watching you, as an activist. We are watching you and the decisions that you are making, they are not good for us. They are not good for our future. You have to reconsider and understand that we have no time left.'

The year 2020 will, without a shadow of a doubt, be etched into the collective memory of human society for a long, long time. It began with the novel coronavirus emerging out of China’s Wuhan and reaching all corners of Earth. It's only now, with the year coming to an end, that the world has begun its retort against COVID-19 through vaccination drives.

While a majority of the global population remained indoors all year to escape the clutches of the pandemic, natural disasters were out in full force, confronting many parts of the world with a catastrophic double whammy.

Here are five such major natural calamities from across the world in the bleak year that was 2020:

Locust Attacks in East Africa and Asia

The 2020 locust outbreak was the worst Kenya has seen in 70 years, and the worst in 25 years for countries like Ethiopia, Somalia, and India. It began in May 2018, when Cyclone Mekunu produced heavy rains over a vast, unpopulated desert in the southern Arabian Peninsula, thereby allowing locusts to breed there undetected. Thereafter, Cyclone Luban in October 2018 exacerbated the locust breeding, enabling three generations of locusts to mass-reproduce over a nine-month period. This led to an 8,000-fold increase in the locust population across the Arabian desert.

These mega-swarms then began migrating as per the wind direction, and by April 2020, the aerial armies had successfully invaded 23 countries—African nations like Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Uganda; Arabian countries like Yemen, Saudi Arabia; Paraguay and Argentina in South America; and South Asian nations such as Iran, Pakistan, and India.

The outbreak in India began in late 2019 and January 2020, with kilometre-wide swarms disrupting lives across ten states—Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Haryana, and Uttarakhand.

Subsequently, the Rajasthan government reported crop damage of 33%, while less than 33% crop damage was reported by the governments of Haryana (6520-hectare area), Madhya Pradesh (4400 ha), Maharashtra (806 ha), Uttar Pradesh (488 ha), and Uttarakhand (267 ha).

Bushfires in Australia

Bushfires in Australia tend to be a regular and widespread occurrence. However, the fires witnessed on the continent last summer—towards the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020—were unusually intense and far more destructive, earning this bushfire season the name ‘Black Summer’. While both natural and manmade causes started these fires, factors like high temperatures, drought conditions, high fuel load (accumulation of fallen bark, leaf litter, small branches), and global warming combined to enhance this disaster.

These raging bushfires led to tremendous destruction across the eastern half of the country, burning an estimated 18.6 million hectares of forests, destroying over 5,900 buildings, and directly killing at least 34 people. A further 445 fatalities were caused due to smoke inhalation, and 65,000 people were displaced, as this disaster affected nearly 80 per cent of Australians one way or another.

The fires also reportedly killed or affected at least 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs, also pushing some threatened species such as the long-footed potoroo, the marsupial, and the Kangaroo Island glossy black cockatoo closer to extinction! These ecological consequences aside, the bushfires also caused tremendous air pollution and carbon emission.

Overall, economists estimate the 2020 bushfires may have cost over 103 billion Australian Dollars in property damage and economic losses, thereby making them Australia's costliest natural disaster to date.

Cyclone Amphan

The year 2020 was another active year in terms of cyclones in the North Indian Ocean, with nine depressions forming in the region and five of them intensifying into cyclonic storms and more. Together, these systems caused damage worth $15.78 billion (one lakh fifty-seven thousand crore rupees), and killed about 269 people.

Advertisement Among these, Amphan—the first super cyclonic storm to have formed in the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 Odisha cyclone—was one of the strongest cyclones to hit India, while also being the costliest cyclone ever recorded in the North Indian Ocean in terms of damage caused.

On May 18, Amphan hit its peak intensity with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 260 km/h (160 mph), and two days later, made landfall over West Bengal. It caused great damage across coastal West Bengal, Odisha, Northeast India, and Bangladesh claiming 128 lives and causing overall destruction worth $13.7 billion (one lakh thirty-seven thousand crore rupees).

A few months later, Cyclone Nivar became the second-most destructive cyclone to hit India in 2020, as it made landfall over Tamil Nadu in late November and caused damage worth $600 million (four thousand crore rupees), killing 14. Other cyclones, namely Nisarga, Gati and Burevi, did cause significant local impacts. But, fortunately, the damages were not as high as Amphan and Nivar.

China Floods

Southern China, particularly the Yangtze basin and its tributaries, was affected by severe floods this year, as heavy rains wreaked havoc across the region during the rainy season between June-September. This disaster also extended to central and eastern China during July, effectively creating the worst flood situation the region has experienced since at least 1998. A total of 443 rivers were flooded nationwide, with 33 of them swelling to the highest levels ever recorded!

As per the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), a spike in rainfall activity—caused by climate change-induced rise in vapours emergence from the Indian and Pacific oceans—led to the flooding. Furthermore, anthropogenic factors like the reclamation of lakes and wetlands, urban development, and mass-disappearance of lakes also helped escalate the events.

By August, the floods had killed at least 219 people across the country, affected about 63.46 million people, and damaged 54,000 houses, 76 key national cultural relics, and 187 provincial cultural heritage sites. Overall, the disaster caused a direct economic loss of 178.96 billion CNY.

The destruction in China aside, the release of water from these swollen rivers may also have contributed to the flooding that occurred in adjoining India’s northeastern state of Assam during this period.

Assam Floods

Monsoon floods are a common occurrence for northeast India. But, the year 2020’s Indian monsoon season was particularly difficult for Assam, as the state remained constantly flooded due to persistent spells of heavy rainfall and above-average seasonal precipitation in the region.

The initial flooding began with heavy showers in May, and it wasn’t until October that the statewide situation began to improve. By then, however, the floods had already affected over 50 lakh residents across 30 districts and 5,474 villages, killed 123 and forced over 1.5 lakh people to seek refuge in 627 relief camps and 1662 relief distribution centres set-up by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA). The floods also induced landslides, which further claimed 26 more lives.

Floods also exacerbated the spread of novel coronavirus in Assam, with the state recording over 2 lakh confirmed COVID-19 cases in this period. Stagnant waters and lack of access to clean water, hygiene supplies are also believed to have caused a spike in dengue, malaria, and Japanese encephalitis cases.

The inundation and subsequent landslides damaged bridges, government buildings, roads, embankments, and schools while putting at least 2.67 lakh hectares of crops to ruin. The flooding also affected the wildlife within the state, with more than 45,000 domesticated animals forced to flee or be abandoned, more than 150 wild animals rescued from the Kaziranga National Park, and 125 animals in the park, including 12 rhinoceros, succumbing to the floodwaters.

KAMPALA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people have been displaced as a result of heavy rains, which triggered floods and landslides and caused havoc in several parts of Uganda, a top government official said on Sunday.

Musa Ecweru, minister of state for relief and disaster preparedness, told Xinhua by telephone that torrential rains which started last month, marking the first major rainfall season in the country, have displaced people, destroyed homes, farms, washed away roads and other infrastructure.

He said most of the affected areas include the mountainous and hilly areas in eastern and western Uganda, low lying and plain areas in eastern region.

""This problem is across the whole country. Now there are thousands of people who are displaced. The officers in my office are compiling the figures (numbers of people) and extent of damage for each district across Uganda,"" said Ecweru.

""We are going to sit down and see how to handle the magnitude of the problem. We shall see how to dispatch some support to the affected persons,"" he said.

The Office of the Prime Minister has been running alert messages, warning that the country will face floods, landslides, strong winds and lightning as the first rain season peaks.

""We have been running alert messages on televisions and radios. These alerts started running about five months ago. We have been telling and warning the country of heavy rains and its dangerous effects,"" said Ecweru.

He said landslides have hit the hilly western district of Kabale.

Ecweru said people living in mountainous areas, flood prone areas as well as wetlands should immediately vacate to safe places as heavy rains continue.

At least two children were killed by floods following heavy rains in the western district of Rubanda on Saturday, according to police.

According to the weather department, several parts of the country especially western and eastern regions, are currently experiencing normal to above normal rainfall, with destructive effects.

In its March-May seasonal rainfall outlook, the Uganda National Meteorological Authority warned of enhanced rainfall over several parts of the country that could result into disasters such as landslides and foods, leading to loss of lives and destruction of property in the first major rain season.

Seventeen people are confirmed dead in the south western region of the country, and a child is still missing.

Speaking to RFI Emmanuel Okecho, a Disaster Protect Officer with Uganda's Office of the Prime Minister explained “the south-west in flood prone because of naturally low-lying areas and marshes.”

Bridges and roads have been submerged by the heaviest rainfall to hit Uganda in over 25 years, complicating relief and rescue efforts.

“The floods have caused millions of shillings worth of damage,” Monica Azuba, Uganda’s Transport Minister, told RFI by telephone from Kampala adding, “the government is prioritising the humanitarian situation before assessing the full extent of infrastructural damage.”

The government dispatched an assessment team on Monday, and the Red Cross are leading search and rescue efforts in the east and south west of the country.

Scores of people are unaccounted for after mudslides engulfed homes killing at least eight people in the foothills of Mount Elgon over the weekend. This, despite concerted efforts by the government and environmental organisations to combat deforestation.

East Africa has been hit by torrential rains in recent weeks unleashing deadly flooding in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania and now Uganda. Two million people have been affected.

“These floods are worse than in 2010 because it has been raining almost constantly for two months,” says Okecho.

The rains are expected to continue at least until the end of December.

December 09, 2019 09:45 AM

KAMPALA - Ugandan authorities say the death toll from a week of floods and mudslides has risen to 36 people and left thousands stranded after heavy rains swept across a mountainous region.

A week of heavy rains caused floods and mudslides in Eastern Uganda’s Bugisu and Bundibugyo regions near Rwenzori Mountain.

Authorities say the flooding has taken a toll with the loss of life and property, and with thousands more left stranded.

The Ugandan Red Cross’s Irene Nakasita says search and rescue operations in the regions are hampered as most roads have been washed away.

“And the decision has been taken to put up a transit shelter until the situation normalizes. So, most likely Bubukwang transit center is going to house close to 700 people who are displaced in Bundibugyo,” she said.

Meanwhile, Uganda’s State Minister for Disaster Preparedness and Relief Musa Ecweru says there are concerns about water-borne disease outbreaks in flood-affected areas.

“Now, there’s a risk of contamination of water and if that is not handled well, then we are going to risk another phase of a challenge, an outbreak of cholera which will compound our humanitarian intervention,” he said.

Ecweru says the government has released $5.4 million for emergency drugs to treat water-borne diseases, inflatable boats, tarps, blankets, food, and repairing bridges.

Ugandan authorities say the flooding is expected to recede in January as the weather improves.

Scientists have long warned that rising ocean temperatures are making seasonal rains more severe and more frequent.

The United Nation’s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) last week (Dec 4) said unusually heavy rainfall and flooding in East Africa has affected over 2.8 million people and left at least 280 dead.

UNOCHA said the unusually heavy rainfall was driven by the differences in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the Indian Ocean.

The UN office said rains were expected to diminish in the weeks ahead but heavy rains would likely persist into December and intensify in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.","Mon, 09 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['continue', 'heavy', 'ugandas', 'say', 'week', 'waterborne', 'ugandan', 'rains', 'floods', 'uganda', 'flooding', 'death', 'toll', 'unusually', 'left', 'rises']",

Currently, Kanyangeya primary school is hosting over 98 households. The area LCI chairperson, Deogracious Isemamba said the school premises and toilets are now being used by a large community.

KASESE - Following the outbreak of floods and landslides that ravaged several areas of mountainous Kasese district, residents continue to express worry over the next course of education after several schools were washed away.

Allan Kambale a resident of Namuhuga ward in Bulembia said schools such as Bulembia primary school, Kilembe and Royal ranges secondary schools, were greatly affected by the floods, whereas others cannot be accessed after several roads and bridges were damaged.

Currently, Kanyangeya primary school is hosting over 98 households. The area LCI chairperson, Deogracious Isemamba said the school premises and toilets are now being used by a large community.

""Even if the school lock-down is lifted soon, pupils will have nowhere to study from unless an alternative area is gazetted for resettlement,"" Isemamba reasoned.

Similar concerns were raised by Rehema Aryema who decried the inevitable pressure on surviving school-premises, saying, learners are bound to meet a big challenge on how to resume studies when the lock-down is lifted.

In May this year, Kasese was hit by disastrous floods. The floods started on May 7 and peaked on the morning of May 10. Another disaster followed on May 21, in areas of Mpondwe-Bwera, where flash floods and landslides further destroyed bridges and infrastructure, leading to the death of more than 10 people.

The current flooding started with river Nyamwamba bursting its banks in areas of Kasese municipality sweeping away Kyanjuki-Katiri bridge and Kilembe mines hospital infrastructure. Simultaneous floods also occurred along rivers of Lhubiriha in Bukonzo west with impacts in the sub-counties of Kitholhu, Karambi and Mpondwe-Lhubiriha town council while river Nyamugasani in Bukonzo East had impacts in the Sub-counties of Kyondo, Kyarumba and Kisinga.

River Mubuku floods, on the other hand, had impacts on the communities of Maliba, Bugoye and Karusandara. Equally affected, were town councils of Ibanda-Kyanya, Kisinga and Mubuku.

Health services still a challenge

Asinet Kabugho recounts the incident of flooding which left several communities cut-off from each other. Some pregnant mothers remained stuck up in the hilly areas and couldn't access medical services.

""The situation was only mitigated by a certain group of volunteers who transported affected people in ambulances,"" Kabugho recollects.

After the nearest Kilembe mines hospital premises were damaged by floods, medical services were shifted to premises of St. Micheal Kindergarten and at Catholic social centre (Karitus hall) in Kasese town.

Dr Edward Wefula the hospital superintendent calls for an urgent alternative water source, mortuary, incinerator, placenta pit and more toilets, saying, the new premises were not designed for a hospital.

However, Sr. Teopista Basemera the Kilembe hospital senior administrator, expressed hope of having more structures with a 200-bed capacity.

Malteser International a worldwide humanitarian relief agency, through the prime minister's office and the ministry of health, committed relief and recovery aid worth sh868m for the period of 3months since May 12.

According to Laura Beutler the technical coordinator for emergency medical services under Malteser, as of May 13, over 39,000 people had been affected by the floods.

""We have made more than 1,317 transferals out of which, 171 babies were successfully delivered from complicated pregnancies,"" noted Laura, adding that, eight of the born babies, were delivered from within ambulances.

She hence expressed a need to build capacity in pre-hospital care, where a formidable team of residents and health workers can be trained to administer first aid before or while transferring a patient to the hospital.

For over 3months of rescue and providing relief support, Malteser trained and passed out 23 Kasese residents in providing emergency medical services among which include, first aid and ambulance operations.

""We are striving to establish an Emergency Medical Services project in Kasese so that people can respond by themselves and activate support in an immediate and structured way,"" noted Laura.

She, however, expressed fear over the possible outbreak of diseases especially the COVID-19. She said the preventive measures are largely missing at all settlement camps.

The population of the people in camp is high, the implementation of the COVID-19 SOPs is hard. Social distancing and hand washing are hard to implement.","Mon, 03 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['worried', 'health', 'medical', 'areas', 'kilembe', 'victims', 'services', 'kasese', 'affected', 'floods', 'uganda', 'premises', 'school', 'hospital', 'education']",

KAMPALA, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan government has released 20 billion shillings (about 5.5 million U.S. dollars) for emergency response after deadly landslides and floods hit parts of the east African country.

Musa Ecweru, minister of state for relief, disaster preparedness and refugees told reporters here on Friday that the funds have been released under the 'life-saving and rescue' phase to address the landslides situation in the mountainous areas and in flooding areas.

At least four people were killed, five injured and over 6,000 people displaced on Tuesday after landslides triggered by torrential rains hit the three villages of Namasa, Naposhi and Shukururu in the eastern district of Bududa.

In neighboring Sironko district, four people including two children were killed while 4,000 others were displaced and plantations, livestock lost after multiple landslides and floods hit Nabodi village, Zesui sub county on Tuesday, according to the Office of the Prime Minister.

Ecweru said the funds will be used for procurement of relief food, tarpaulins, blankets, drugs for water borne diseases, inflatable boats and culverts for fixing washed away bridges.

""Post disaster needs assessment will be conducted in January 2020 to determine total level of damage and losses and actions for the recovery and reconstruction,"" he said.

Ecweru said a rapid assessment conducted in the most affected mountainous districts of Bududa, Sironko, Manafwa, Namisidwa and Mbale puts the number of displaced persons at 25,000 while some 85,000 households were affected and 21,500 hectares of crop and plantation damaged.

At least 55,000 people have been displaced and over 120,000 hectares of crops destroyed by floods in the low lying Teso and Bukedi sub regions also in the eastern part of the country.

Ecweru said the northwestern part of the country has equally suffered losses of crop and homes to flooding following high water levels on River Nile.

Other parts of the country, according to the minister, have also suffered some considerable losses due to the ongoing torrential rains.","Fri, 06 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",,"['landslides', 'deadly', 'torrential', 'releases', 'govt', 'hit', 'funds', 'displaced', 'losses', 'floods', 'uganda', 'emergency', 'sub', 'suffered', 'water', 'xinhua']",
