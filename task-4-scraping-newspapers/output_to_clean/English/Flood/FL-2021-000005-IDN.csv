Description of the disaster

Indonesia has high level of precipitation and is prone to flooding during rainy season. According to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency, areas prone to flooding in Indonesia are approximately 39,371,167 hectares. These areas are inhabited by approximately 100,814,666 people. Indonesia’s Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency (Indonesian: Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika, abbreviated BMKG) predicted the peak of La Nina would occur across the months of December 2020 and January 2021. The peak of La Nina is coinciding with the peak of the rainy season which usually occurs between January and February. The simultaneous occurrence of these two events has triggered heavy rainfall across the country. Since December 2020 PMI has responded to around 14 different flooding events across several provinces. The most recent event, which commenced on 15 January 2021, has resulted in flooding and landslides in several districts in South Kalimantan province including in Tapin, Hulu Sungai Tengah, Hulu Sungai Utara, Hulu Sungai Selatan, Tanah Laut, Tabalong, Banjar, Banjarbaru, Banjarmasin, Balangan, and Barito Kuala.

Through its disaster monitoring portal - InaRisk, Indonesia’ Disaster Monitoring Agency has listed 13 districts6 in South Kalimantan as moderate-risk and high-risk flood areas. Moreover, Indonesia’s BMKG has also issued flood warnings for the above-mentioned districts. All districts currently affected by flooding are included in the list.

Flooding in Banjar, 12 January 2021

On 12 January 2021, significant heavy rain, which started in the first week of January caused Martapura and Riam rivers to overflow, flooding seven sub-districts in Banjar. As of 19 January, seven sub-districts; Karang Intan, East Martapura, Martapura, Astambul, Sungai Pinang, Pengaron, and Tabuk River were inundated with water level ranging from 20 - 100cm.

Based on PMI Situation Report no. 7 dated 19 January 2021, PMI estimated that 27,368 housing units inundated, and 4 bridges have been destroyed. Approximately 30,778 families and 120,416 people are affected by the floods. Over 32,113 people have been evacuated to several temporary shelters that are using school buildings, village halls, mosques, and a football stadium.A more detailed information regarding current evacuation centres is still unavailable.

Flooding in Tanah Laut, 12 January 2021

In Tanah Laut, on 12 January 2021, heavy rainfall which started in the prior week caused severe flooding. In this region, the ongoing high tide further deteriorates the flooding situation. Flooding impacts nine sub-districts; Pelaihari, Bati-bati,

Kurau, Bumi Makmur, Tambang Ulang, Bajuin, Takisung, Jorong, and Kintap were affected. In some areas the water level reaches 150 - 200cm.

The impacts of flooding in Tanah Laut are severe. About 8,506 houses are inundated. Several public facilities such as schools, places of worship, hospitals, and markets have also been impacted. Several roads are also completely submerged in water, including the Trans Kalimantan Access Route. Approximately 8,870 families and 27,815 people are affected by the floods. There have been 10 reported fatalities as a result of being swept away by current and buried by landslide. So far, 13,062 people have sought safety in several temporary shelters. The displaced persons are taking shelter in school buildings and relatives’ homes.

Flooding in Tapin, 14 January 2021

Excessive rainfall on 14 January caused the flooding to spread to wider areas. Flooding in Tapin Regency was observed at 01:00 local time, occurred in Binuang sub-district, Raya Belanti Village. As of 16 January, 515 households and 1,492 people have been affected. As of 19 January, 328 people have sought safety to temporary shelters.

Flooding in Hulu Sungai Tengah, 14 January 2021

In Hulu Sungai Tengah district, flooding occurred on 13 January 2021, at 23.00 local time. Two sub-districts were inundated, namely Barabai and Hantakan. In some areas, the water level was reaching 200cm. As of 19 January 2021, 16,100 households and 64,400 people have been affected by the floods. There have been 3 reported fatalities in the district. Thus far, 11,200 people have sought safety to temporary shelters.

Flooding in other regions (Balangan, Banjarbaru,Hulu Selatan, and Hulu Sungai Utara), 14 January 2021 In Balangan district, floods occurred because of the overflowing of the Balangan and Pitap Rivers, affecting Tebing Tinggi sub-district (Mayanau Village, Gunung Batu, Sungsum, Ju'uh, Bumbu'an Simpang, Simpang Nadung and Tebing Tinggi), and Awayan sub-district (Putat Basiun Village, Awayan Market, Badalungga, Badalungga Hilir, Pulantan and Muara Jaya). In this district, 3,941 houses inundated and 6,235 families or 19,100 people have been affected.

In Banjarbaru, flooding is caused by high intensity rain which overflowed the Kemuning River. Flooding was observed at around 01:10 local time with a water level of 50 - 90cm. Two sub-districts affected are Kemuning Village (Banjarbaru sub-district) and Guntung Payung Village (Landasan Ulin sub-district). As of 19 January 2021, 2,116 households and 5,752 people have been affected by the flood. There has been one reported fatality.

Flooding also occurred in Hulu Sungai Selatan district, inundated six sub-districts: Loksado, Padang Batung,

Kandangan, Angkinang, Telaga Langsat and Sungai Raya, with water levels reaching 150cm. In this district, 1,000 housing units submerged in water, affecting about 3,138 families and 6,690 people. As of 19 January 2021, the water has receded.

In Hulu Sungai Utara, flooding is caused by high intensity rain which overflowed Balangan and Tabalong rivers, flooding 4 sub-districts. According to PMI’s situation report dated 19 January 2021, 7,865 households and 25,189 people have been affected by the flood. A total of 6,804 housing units were inundated.

As of 19 January 2021, in PMI’s targeted areas approximately 39,874 houses have been inundated. About 56,263 families and 214,123 people are affected by the floods. Indonesia’s meteorological agency has warned that heavy rainfall with thunderstorm and wind is still expected to occur over the next few days in almost all districts in South Kalimantan.

Although this flooding event is only impacting one province, it is impacting over 300,000 people and all districts within the province and has the potential to worsen further in the coming weeks as heavy rains continue. Furthermore, the flood response and evacuation efforts face considerable complications due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Indonesia is currently experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 also poses great risk in South Kalimantan since there have been a total of 16,505 cases detected in the province as of 15 January 2021, with 1,250 active cases.

Due to these complexities the disaster has been classified as a category orange.","Wed, 20 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1552569-MDRID021do%20%281%29.png?itok=rUtHVyfT,"['operation', '2021', 'areas', 'kalimantan', 'emergency', 'sungai', 'subdistricts', 'mdrid021', 'affected', 'floods', 'water', 'dref', '19', 'epoa', 'flooding', 'inundated', 'indonesia', 'plan', 'south', 'hulu']",

JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated and more than a dozen have been killed in recent days in flooding on Indonesia's Borneo island, officials said Sunday.

National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson Raditya Jati said floods brought by intense rains caused floodwaters as high as 3 meters (10 feet).

As of Sunday, 39,549 people had been evacuated and at least 15 had been killed due to floods that affected 10 districts and cities in South Kalimantan province on Borneo island.

Separately, five people were killed and 500 others were evacuated after floods and landslides in Manado city in North Sulawesi province on Saturday. One other person was missing.

The data begs to differ - Mongabay.com",https://news.mongabay.com/2021/01/plantations-mines-south-kalimantan-indonesia-borneo-flood-environment-minister-denies/,"Indonesia’s environment minister claims deforestation for oil palm plantations and coal mines had nothing to do with a recent deadly flood in southern Borneo.

But the ministry’s own data, and statements by a senior minister, attribute the intensity of the flooding on the massive loss of forest cover across the Barito River’s watershed.

Environmental activists say the deforestation has compromised the natural function of the watershed to absorb the heavy rains that caused the Barito and its tributaries to overflow following heavy rains.

The coordinating minister for human development has called for a more sustainable management of natural resources in the region, warning against unbridled exploitation.

JAKARTA — The Indonesian government has denied that deforestation for oil palm plantations and coal mines contributed to a recent deadly flood in southern Borneo.

At least 21 people died and more than 256,000 were affected in what President Joko Widodo has called the worst flooding in South Kalimantan province in 50 years. Environmental activists say the massive loss of forest cover across the region exacerbated the disaster, compromising the natural function of the Barito River watershed to absorb the heavy rains that caused the river and its tributaries to overflow.

But Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar has denounced this as “misinformation,” saying the high volume of rain — nine times the average amount from Jan. 9-13 — was to blame for the disaster.

“There has been misinformation, especially [because] there’s a lot of invalid data deliberately pushed by some parties,” she wrote in Indonesian on Twitter on Jan. 20. “The cause of flooding in South Kalimantan [is] weather anomaly, and not about the size of forests in the Barito River’s watershed area in South Kalimantan.”

Yet her ministry’s own data, among other references, clearly show rapid deforestation in the river’s watershed. In the past three decades, the 1.8-million-hectare (4.4-million-acre) water catchment area in South Kalimantan lost nearly two-thirds of its natural forest, or an area three times the size of London, according to the data.

Other government sources show a similar trend. According to data from the Indonesian space agency, LAPAN, an area twice the size of London has been deforested in the Barito River’s watershed over the past 10 years. More than half of the 322,000 hectares (800,000 acres) cleared comprised primary and secondary forest and scrubland.

A separate analysis of satellite imagery by Greenpeace shows 304,000 hectares (750,000 acres) of forest lost in South Kalimantan’s watershed areas between 2001 and 2019. It shows the Barito watershed now has less than half of its original forest cover.

Siti said that while the Barito’s catchment area has been largely deforested, the upstream areas still have significant forest cover.

“Using data from 2019, as much as 83.3% of the Barito’s watershed is covered with natural forests, and the rest of 1.3% is plantation forests,” she said. “In this case, the upstream area of the Barito River’s watershed is still well protected.”

Saparis Soedarjanto, the ministry’s director of watershed planning and management, said no amount of forest cover could help the region withstand the amount of rainfall that occurred there during that period, and that flooding was therefore inevitable.

“No matter how dense the forests are in the upstream area, if the hills are steep and the downstream area is flat, then [the region] will be inundated [when there are heavy rains],” Saparis said.

Lana Saria, the environmental director at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, said mining activity in the region, for which large areas are deforested, makes a positive contribution to the forests.

“It in fact improves the capability of the watershed to become a water catchment area,” she said.

Not functioning well

A top government official, Muhadjir Effendy, the coordinating minister for human development and culture, has taken the opposite stance, saying the flood is evidence that the natural environment in South Kalimantan has become degraded to the point that it can no longer mitigate against natural phenomena like heavy rains.

If the environment were still in good condition, he said, then the extreme rainfall brought by the La Niña weather pattern would not have caused such severe floods.

Baharuddin, an oceanographer at Lambung Mangkurat University in South Kalimantan, backed this view, saying the rapid loss of forest cover in the watershed area contributed to the flooding. When the area was still largely forested, it could handle rainfall of as much as 4,000 millimeters (157 inches) per year, or nearly double the national average for Indonesia, Baharuddin said.

The environment ministry’s own data again supports this point.

“If we look at the environmental service of water management [of the Barito watershed], it’s not 100% functioning well, only 34.2%,” M.S. Karliansyah, the ministry’s head of environmental degradation mitigation and control, said in a televised interview. “Or 65.8% of it is problematic.”

Using data from the country’s geospatial agency, Baharuddin said it’s clear how the watershed area’s forested landscape has been altered beyond recognition by industrial expansion from 1997 to 2019.

“The latest data show the existence of mining activities and monoculture plantations, such as oil palm and rubber, and they’re quite massive and rapid in the Barito watershed,” he said. “Rainfall is the main trigger [of the floods], but land condition that has been deforested can’t be ignored.”

Coal mining concessions account for more than half a million hectares (1.2 million acres) of land throughout South Kalimantan, according to data from the environmental NGO Auriga Nusantara. Almost of all them lie in the Barito watershed, with four-fifths located in areas that serve as water catchment in the watershed.

“It means that almost all the mines in South Kalimantan are located in the upstream area of the Barito watershed, which functions as water catchment,” Auriga Nusantara data director Dedi Pratama Sukmara said as quoted by the Tempo newspaper.

These mines have left trail of destruction, with abandoned mining pits dotted throughout the watershed area, according to Karliansyah.

“We found former mining areas that haven’t been rehabilitated,” he said. “They contribute [to the environmental degradation] in the form of [river] sedimentation that is quite significant.”

Plantations have also come under the spotlight in the wake of the flood. Satellite imagery analysis shows 219,000 hectares (541,000 acres), an area nearly twice the size of Los Angeles, of new plantations established in the Barito watershed in the past decade. In total, plantations cover 650,000 hectares (1.6 million acres), occupying 14% of the Barito’s watershed of 4.5 million hectares (11.1 million acres).

The Agriculture Ministry, meanwhile, identifies 564,632 hectares (1.4 million acres) of oil palm plantations in the province as of 2020.

The environment ministry says most of the non-forested area in the Barito watershed comprises small-scale farms, not plantations.

Muhadjir said the unbridled exploitation of natural resources had damaged the environment in South Kalimantan and brought disasters like the recent flooding. He called for a more sustainable management of natural resources in the region.

“Let’s use nature wisely by fully calculating the benefits and the risks,” he said in a press release. “Don’t let the benefits turn out to be smaller than the risks. Don’t let [a few] reap too much benefits [from the environment], while others bear too high of a risk.”

Situation Updates

Indonesia’s Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency predicts the peak of La Nina to occur in December 2020 and January 2021. The peak of La Nina coincides with the peak of rainy season which usually occurs between January and February. The agency also states that this phenomenon could increase precipitation which triggers heavy rainfall across the country. During this period, Indonesia frequently suffers flood and landslides. As of January 14, 2021, several provinces in the country had reported floods and landslides since the beginning of the year.

Flooding in Lhokseumawe and Langsa, Aceh province, 4 January 2021

Excessive rainfall since Saturday, 2 January 2021, caused Kareung Pase river to overflow, flooding several areas in Lhokseumawe and Langsa. The flood had caused four sub-districts namely Blang Mangat, Banda Sakti, Muara Dua, and Muara Satu to be inundated with floodwater ranging from 60-70 cm. As a result, hundreds of people from 171 households were temporarily displaced. Flooding also inundated hundreds of houses in the affected areas. In Langsa, flooding inundated four sub-districts namely Langsa Barat, Langsa Lama, Langsa Baro, and Langsa Timur. Approximately 9,448 people who reside in the four sub-districts were affected. The flood has receded, however, several Langsa areas inundated again on 12 January 2021.

Indonesia’s Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency predicts rain is still going to occur on 13-15 January 2021. The agency also categorizes several districts in the province —Aceh Barat Daya, Aceh Selatan,

Aceh Tenggara, and Gayo Lues— as high-risk flood areas. Meanwhile, Indonesia’s Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation lists several districts in the province —Aceh Tamiang, Aceh Selatan, Aceh Timur, and Gayo Lues, and Nagan Raya— as high-risk landslides areas.","Sat, 16 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1551996-IBIDFL160121.png?itok=bm-NCobc,"['flooding', 'province', 'red', 'information', '2021', 'areas', 'inundated', 'indonesia', 'aceh', 'langsa', 'agency', 'flood', 'bulletin', 'landslides', 'subdistricts']",

An analysis by Indonesia’s space agency shows an area of forest twice the size of London was cleared in the past decade in the watershed area of the Barito River in South Kalimantan province.

During the same period, plantations spanning twice the size of Los Angeles have been established in the watershed area.

Activists have called for a sweeping review of licenses as well as rehabilitation of degraded areas in the region.

JAKARTA — Recent floods that inundated large areas of the southern part of Indonesian Borneo might have been exacerbated by massive deforestation for oil palm plantations and coal mines, activists say.

Heavy rains over the course of several days in early January battered the province of South Kalimantan, causing the Barito and other rivers to overflow. Floodwaters, in some areas as high as 3 meters (10 feet), forced the displacement of more than 112,000 people and claimed at least 21 lives. Nearly 200,000 hectares (500,000 acres) have been affected.

President Joko Widodo, during a visit to the affected district of Banjar, attributed the disaster to the heavy and sustained rainfall. But environmentalists say the rapid loss of forest in the region in recent decades contributed to the scale of the flooding.

An area twice the size of London has been deforested in the Barito River’s watershed over the past 10 years, according to data from the Indonesian space agency, LAPAN. More than half of the 322,000 hectares (800,000 acres) cleared comprised primary and secondary forest and scrubland.

A separate analysis of satellite imagery by Greenpeace shows 304,000 hectares (750,000 acres) of forest lost in South Kalimantan’s watershed areas between 2001 and 2019. It shows the Barito watershed now has less than half of its original forest cover, while the watershed of another river in the province, the Maluka, has less than 1% of its forest cover remaining.

“It shows the carrying capacity of the forests in that region has drastically decreased,” Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner Arie Rompas said.

Trees hold the soil in place, preventing erosion that results in heavy silting of rivers during rains. Silting makes rivers shallower, decreasing their water flow rate and making it more likely that they will overflow in the event of heavy rains.

The country’s disaster mitigation agency, the BNPB, has called for further studies to determine the cause of the South Kalimantan flooding.

“We also need to involve the Ministry of Environment and Forestry in [analyzing] the management of river areas and spatial planning,” BNPB disaster data, information and communications department head Raditya Jati said.

Palm oil

LAPAN analysis of satellite imagery shows 219,000 hectares (541,000 acres), an area nearly twice the size of Los Angeles, of new plantations established in the Barito River’s watershed in the past decade. In total, plantations cover 650,000 hectares (1.6 million acres), occupying 14% of the Barito’s watershed of 4.5 million hectares (11.1 million acres), according to LAPAN’s remote-sensing division head, Rokhis Khomarudin.

He said the analysis could provide an explanation of the possible cause of the recent flooding.

“We understand that plantations are related to the economy, but the environmental aspect has to be paid attention to,” Rokhis said.

However, the analysis hasn’t identified the type of the crops being cultivated in the area.

“Because the data is from mid-resolution satellite data, [we] haven’t been able to determine [whether the plantations are] oil palm or other plantations,” Rokhis said.

There’s conflicting data on the true extent of oil palm plantations in South Kalimantan. The Agriculture Ministry identifies 564,632 hectares (1.4 million acres) of oil palm plantations in the province as of 2020. The Central Statistics Agency, BPS, lists 424,932 hectares (1.05 million acres) as of 2018.

Half of the plantation area, 227,791 hectares (562,884 acres), is owned or controlled by the 25 largest agribusiness conglomerates in Indonesia, according to a 2019 report by TuK Indonesia, an NGO that advocates for social justice in the agribusiness sector.

Among these conglomerates are Jardine Matheson Group, Triputra Group and Sinar Mas Group, which control 61,932 hectares (153,037 acres), 49,500 hectares (122,300 acres) and 48,741 hectares (120,442 acres) of oil palm concessions respectively, the report shows.

The Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi), the country’s largest green group, says it’s clear that South Kalimantan is in an ecological crisis driven by unbridled deforestation.

Half of South Kalimantan’s total area of 3.7 million hectares (9.1 million acres) has been parceled off to the palm oil industry and the mining industry.

“Indeed, these floods are strongly suspected to be caused by the ecosystems that have lost their carrying capacity,” Walhi executive director Nur Hidayati said. “So when there is extreme weather, the carrying capacity collapses and causes disasters.”

Walhi South Kalimantan chapter head Kisworo Dwi Cahyono said the destruction of natural ecosystems in the upstream areas of the province’s rivers leads to flooding downstream.

“So this is [caused by] a disarray in the management of the environment and natural resources, and then the degradation of environmental carrying capacity,” he said.

Data from Global Forest Watch show that oil palm is not the only crop that might have contributed to deforestation in the region. In Hulu Sungai Tengah district, where 64,400 people were affected by the flooding, mixed fruit plantations occupy the largest span of plantation area, at 4,000 hectares (9,900 acres), while oil palms occupy only 200 hectares (500 acres).

In Banjar district, where floods displaced more than 51,000 people, rubber trees are the dominant crop, covering 38,500 hectares (95,100 acres), followed by oil palms at 27,900 hectares (68,900 acres).

But in Balangan district, where nearly 12,000 people have been displaced, mixed oil palm plantations cover the largest area, 19,800 hectares (48,900 acres).

While the dominant crops differ, all three districts have one thing in common: all have experienced massive deforestation. In 2000, lush natural forests in all three districts were still largely intact, occupying from 50% to 78% of the total area. By 2016, almost all of them were gone.

Mining

Besides oil palm plantations, environmentalists have also attributed the flooding to the proliferation of mines in the region. Walhi data show 814 coal mining pits left by 157 companies after they finished digging.

The Mining Advocacy Network (Jatam) says there are 177 mining concessions dotted throughout the flooded districts.

According to data from the South Kalimantan provincial government, there were 13 coal companies with mining contracts and 160 firms with mining permits in the province as of 2013.

Combined, concessions for mining and oil palm plantations occupy half of South Kalimantan’s total area; 33% of the land falls under mining concessions and 17% under oil palm concessions, Walhi says.

“The biggest cause of deforestation in Kalimantan [Indonesian Borneo] right now is palm oil and coal,” Greenpeace Indonesia climate campaigner Hindun Mulaika said.

This is not the first time a major natural disaster in Indonesia has been linked to environmental destruction wrought by the plantation and the mining industries. In 2019, the hilly district of North Konawe on the island of Sulawesi was struck by floods that displaced thousands of people.

A report by the ombudsman of Southeast Sulawesi province said that “generally the cause [of the flooding] was land conversion for plantations, mining and illegal logging.” An analysis of the floods by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry cited “river silting” and “oil palm plantations” as among the causes of the disaster.

Extensive mining along North Konawe’s coast might also have been a factor. The mining exacerbated silting near the mouth of the Lasolo River, resulting in a “backwater effect” that intensified the flooding, the ministry’s report says.

Activists have called for a sweeping review of plantation and mining licenses in South Kalimantan as well as a moratorium on new mining permits in the wake of the recent floods.

“The current condition shows that the environmental carrying capacity [in South Kalimantan] is no longer capable [of mitigating disasters],” Hindun said.

Jatam campaign head Melky Nahar said it’s also important for the government to enforce the law by revoking mining and plantation permits in areas that play a crucial role in protecting the environment and the people who live there. He added the government should also start rehabilitating degraded areas in South Kalimantan.

“Without that, similar incidents will happen again [in the future] and we will listen to [rhetorical] statements from President Joko Widodo again,” Melky said.

Jefri Raharja, a campaigner at Walhi South Kalimantan, said the widespread deforestation in the region has also exacerbated global climate change.

“Kalimantan was once proud of its forests, but now the forests have been replaced by monoculture oil palm plantations and coal mines,” he said.

Because when the Human Initiative team was there, the local residents were still not properly coordinated in the flow of disaster management, starting from data collection on affected residents, affected houses, Human Initative also provided direction and input.

Hantakan District has 12 villages, with 7 affected villages and 2 isolated villages because the bridge was disconnected The number of population is 122,689 in 12 villages, consisting of 6,424 men and 6,265 women, with around 1800 families affected.

The Human Initiative post is at coordinates 2 ° 38'22.0 ""S 115 ° 27'17.8"" e, a quite strategic location to reach villages located in the watershed of Hantakan sub district. Human Initiative continues to coordinate with the local government, and conduct field assessments, logistics distribution, to basic health services.

On 19/1/21 the assistance started to enter the village, but there are still some areas that are quite far away and are still difficult to get logistical access and other assistance. With a distance of 7 km to 19 km, the location of the newly isolated village can be accessed. With this condition, the field team is still conducting further assessment on the isolated village as the 4-wheeled vehicles cannot reach 2 isolated villages.

The village still has difficulties to have clean water facilities. The residents still rely on rivers around them for public toilets and daily water consumption. On the other hand in health facilities, the Community Health Center (Puskesmas) at the village is located relatively far away from the village, and until.now there has not been any health service provided at the village.","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1552766-04-Sitrep-4-Banjir-KalSel-English-Version.png?itok=FUD9GpXh,"['houses', 'regency', '2021', 'floods', 'village', 'kalimantan', 'indonesia', 'human', 'initiative', 'sitrep', 'south', 'hulu', 'villages', '21', 'sungai', 'disaster']",

The government has downplayed any link between deforestation and tree cover loss and the recent widespread floods in South Kalimantan, saying the devastation was primarily caused by a weather anomaly.

Rare and extreme rainfall was the main trigger, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and his subordinates said of the major floods, which so far have killed at least 15 people and displaced more than 100,000 others.

During his visit to the flood-affected Banjar regency on Monday, Jokowi said the intensity of rainfall had surpassed the capacity of the Barito River, the largest river in the province that originates in Central Kalimantan. He said rainwater with a volume of 2.1 billion cubic meters had entered the river, exceeding its normal capacity of 230 million cubic meters.

The Environment and Forestry Ministry concurred with the President, saying the...","Thu, 21 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/09/24/2020_09_24_104756_1600923645._large.jpg,"['river', 'rainfall', 'jokowi', 'jakarta', 'capacity', 'deforestation', 'president', 'caused', 'floods', 'kalimantan', 'cubic', 'saying', 'govt']",

Flooding in South Kalimantan has killed more than a dozen people and displaced tens of thousands. Rescue workers are still looking for several missing and feared buried under the mud 10 days after landslides tore through a village in West Java. And divers continue to search for victims and crucial data in the wreckage of Sriwijaya Air flight 182, which crashed in the Java Sea on January 9, with 62 people on board.

Meanwhile, two volcanoes on the most populous island, Java, are spewing ash into the air, with hundreds of people evacuated from the slopes of Mount Merapi in recent weeks.

Earthquake death toll climbs

On Sunday, the death toll from a 6.2-magnitude earthquake on Indonesia's Sulawesi island rose to 84, as rescue workers continued the search for survivors trapped in rubble while aftershocks rattled the island.

Seventy-three people died in Friday's quake in the city of Mamuju, to the north of the epicenter, while another 11 were killed in Majene, a city about 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Mamuju. Thousands of residents fled their homes to seek safety, but many are still trapped under collapsed buildings, according to local search and rescue teams.

At least 253 people were seriously hurt and another 679 suffered minor injuries, said Raditya Jati, from Indonesia's National Board for Disaster Management. The quake also triggered a power outage and caused three landslides along the main road connecting Majene and Mamuju.

The quake has created an additional headache for a nation already battling a serious coronavirus outbreak. Indonesia has reported at least 907,929 Covid-19 cases and nearly 26,000 related deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

The head of Indonesia's disaster management agency, Doni Monardo, said Sunday that rapid antigen test kits were being provided to evacuation centers to check and trace for potential Covid-19 transmission among the 19,435 people displaced by the earthquake.

""Later there will be an antigen swab process, to ensure that refugees are not exposed to Covid-19,"" Doni said. He added that displacement centers have been asked to separate vulnerable groups from young people to prevent the virus spreading.

Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency cautioned that aftershocks could still occur and urged those living in hilly areas to be aware of landslides. People living near the coast were also warned to stay away from the beach in case of tsunamis.

Meanwhile, rescue teams were continuing to free people trapped under collapsed buildings in multiple locations across Mamuju -- including two hotels and a hospital. ""People are reporting that their family members are trapped under collapsed houses and asking for our help,"" Ariyanto Ardi, section head of the local disaster management department, told CNN on Saturday.

""We still have no details how many people are buried under those flattened buildings,"" he added.

In this picture taken on January 16, 2021, lava is seen during an eruption of Mount Semeru in Lumajang, East Java.

Straddling the so-called Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" Indonesia -- a nation of high tectonic activity -- is regularly hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In 2018, a 6.2-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami struck the city of Palu, in Sulawesi, killing thousands of people.

Mount Merapi, Indonesia's most active volcano, began erupting again on January 4. Since then, 500 people living on or close to its fertile slopes have been evacuated, according to the local Disaster Management of Magelang District.

On Monday, Merapi continued to spew lava as hot clouds and ash rose 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) into the air, according to the Indonesian Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation. The agency said six lava flows could be seen, descending 600 meters down its southwestern slope.

Also on Java Island, Indonesia's highest volcano Mount Semeru began spewing lava, ash and smoke on Saturday.

Flooding and landslides

Floods brought on by heavy rain in South Kalimantan province on the island of Borneo this week have killed at least 15 people and displaced more than 100,000.

Waters as high as 1.5 meters (5 feet) inundated more than 20,000 homes across 10 districts in the province, according to Raditya from the disaster management agency.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the flood-hit areas on Monday as rescue teams distributed aid including food, tarpaulins and blankets, to those in need.

Separately, at least six people were killed in flooding and landslides in Manado City, in North Sulawesi on Saturday.

Rescuers evacuate people from a flooded residential area in Banjarbaru, South Kalimantan, Borneo Island, on 17 January 2021.

The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency warned that more rain could follow, saying the region was in the middle of the rainy season, which will last until February.

Meanwhile, rescue workers continue to search through mud and debris for victims 10 days after a landslide, brought on by heavy rains and unstable soil conditions, tore through Cihanjuang village in West Java province. On Monday, four bodies were pulled from the mud, raising the death toll to 33. Rescue workers are searching for four people still missing, according to the West Java Search and Rescue Agency.

Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands, often suffers floods and landslides, particularly during the rainy season from November to March. In December 2019 and January 2020, severe flooding in Jakarta triggered by the worst rainfall on record, left swaths of the capital underwater and affected more than 400,000 people.

Experts have voiced concern that such extreme weather could become a new norm due to the climate crisis.

Rescue teams search for victims buried by the landslides in Cihanjuang Village, West Java.

Sriwijaya Air crash

In another disaster that rocked the Southeast Asian nation, divers continue their search of the wreckage of Sriwijaya Air flight 182 while authorities push on in their investigation into the cause of the crash.

On Friday, search teams located the plane's cockpit voice recorder but the memory unit was not with the case, Soerjanto Tjahjono, Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee, told CNN.

Despite the missing crash memory unit, Soerjanto said they believed they would still be able to retrieve data.

The flight data recorder of Sriwijaya Air flight 182 retrieved from the Java Sea where the passenger jet crashed on January 12, 2021.

Also on Friday, the committee successfully downloaded information contained in the recovered flight data recorder, which was found by divers and a remotely operated underwater vehicle last week.

""There are 330 parameters and all are in good condition. We are currently studying it,"" Soerjanto said.

The findings from the flight data recorder data have so far confirmed earlier reports that the two engines were still operating when the plane hit the water.

Efforts to find and identify those who perished on board also continue. On Sunday, divers retrieved 10 bags of human remains as well as pieces and debris from the plane itself.","Mon, 18 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210118003347-04-indonesia-disasters-earthquake-floods-intl-hnk-restricted-super-tease.jpg,"['flooding', 'earthquake', 'sriwijaya', 'crash', 'collapsed', 'mamuju', 'grapples', 'fallout', 'air', 'indonesia', 'photos', 'building', 'search', '27', 'hide', 'rescue', 'landslides', 'caption']",

JAKARTA, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Three people died and one was missing in the floods that have submerged eight sub-districts in Manado City, North Sulawesi province, according to a local official on Saturday.

Head of the Manado City Disaster Management Agency Donald Sambuaga said that the eight subdistricts are Malalayang, Wanea, Sario, Paal Dua, Pikkala, Wenang, Tuminting, and Singkil.

""Rains with high intensity since Friday have caused the Sawangan and Tondano rivers, which run through Manado City, to overflow,"" Sambuaga said.

Floods as high as 50 to 400 centimeters also caused landslides in several points.

A coalition of civil groups is mulling over a plan to file a lawsuit against the government, demanding the latter take responsibility for environmental damage that led to widespread flooding in South Kalimantan recently.

Days of heavy rainfall that began in early January triggered massive flooding in the province, inundating all but two regencies. The floods killed at least 21 people and forced more than 110,000 others to flee their homes.

While environmentalists pointed fingers at deforestation and tree cover loss as the root of the disaster, the government downplayed the role of such damage, saying the flooding was primarily caused by a weather anomaly. President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo said the intensity of rainfall had surpassed the capacity of the Barito River, the largest river in the province.

South Kalimantan on Borneo island declared a state of emergency last week, after heavy rainfall and flooding since the start of the year displaced tens of thousands of people.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the worst-hit areas on Monday.

Yuyun Harmono, climate justice campaign manager at the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (WALHI), said the floods are “an indication that the government should have more ambition in their climate policies.”

The archipelago is already suffering the impacts of rising global temperatures, with its cities and coastal areas hit by regular flooding and rising sea levels.

“Indonesia is one of the countries that is very vulnerable to the climate crisis,” said Adila Isfandiari, climate and energy researcher at Greenpeace Indonesia.

“It is rooted in the position of the government that prioritizes economic growth over the environment,” she said.

Under the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb global warming, Indonesia — among the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitters — committed to cut its emissions by 29% by 2030 versus business-as-usual levels, a target it said could rise to 41% with international support.

Earlier this month, a climate official at Indonesia’s environment and forestry ministry told the Antara news agency the country would not increase its emissions reduction goals further in an updated climate action plan due to be submitted ahead of a U.N. climate summit in November, as nations are expected to do.

Ruandha Agung Sugardiman, director general of climate change control, said Indonesia would instead focus on implementation and steps to meet its existing commitments.

Home to the world’s third-largest tropical forests, Indonesia is the biggest global producer of palm oil and a major source of timber, which many green groups blame for the clearing of forests for plantations.

According to analysis by research coalition Climate Action Tracker, Indonesia’s current climate policies are “highly insufficient” and emissions are still climbing.

Indonesia was one of only five countries that started new coal-power plant construction in 2020, it noted.

“The government must introduce policy to reduce total emissions in order to meet the Paris climate goals, but the emissions in Indonesia are on an upwards trajectory,” said Sisilia Nurmala Dewi, Indonesia team leader at climate campaign group 350.org.

The government has, nonetheless, worked in recent years to stop illegal logging, protect its carbon-storing forests and meet its international pledges to tackle climate change.

Besides introducing a moratorium on new forest clearance, in the past five years it has allocated on average nearly 90 trillion rupiah ($6.4 billion) per year to tackle climate change, although that dropped to around 80 trillion rupiah in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

New laws to cut red tape and boost investment and mining, introduced last year, were criticized by environmentalists who said they would fuel more forest-clearing and fires.

JAKARTA, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 436 houses in Jember district, East Java province, were submerged by floods with the height of more than one meter, the Jember Regional Disaster Management Agency said on Saturday.

The agency's emergency and logistics head Heru Widagdo said the floods also submerged a school building and two worship houses.

""So far we haven't received any reports of casualties, hopefully, none,"" said Widagdo.

Widagdo added that the floods occurred as the Bedadung River overflowed and inundated settlements in seven sub-districts.

Authorities have evacuated residents, especially the elderly and toddlers whose houses were flooded.

The floods have started to recede at several points, but residents are on the alert to anticipate further flooding as rainfalls are still high.

South Kalimantan on Borneo island declared a state of emergency last week, after heavy rainfall and flooding since the start of the year displaced tens of thousands of people.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the worst-hit areas on Monday.

Yuyun Harmono, climate justice campaign manager at the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (WALHI), said the floods are “an indication that the government should have more ambition in their climate policies”.

The archipelago is already suffering the impacts of rising global temperatures, with its cities and coastal areas hit by regular flooding and rising sea levels.

“Indonesia is one of the countries that is very vulnerable to the climate crisis,” said Adila Isfandiari, climate and energy researcher at Greenpeace Indonesia.

“It is rooted in the position of the government that prioritises economic growth over the environment,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Under the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb global warming, Indonesia — among the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitters — committed to cut its emissions by 29% by 2030 vs business-as-usual levels, a target it said could rise to 41% with international support.

Earlier in January, a climate official at Indonesia's environment and forestry ministry told Antara news agency the country would not increase its emissions reduction goals further in an updated climate action plan due to be submitted ahead of a UN climate summit in November, as nations are expected to do.

Ruandha Agung Sugardiman, director-general of climate change control, said Indonesia would instead focus on implementation and steps to meet its existing commitments.

Home to the world's third-largest tropical forests, Indonesia is the biggest global producer of palm oil and a major source of timber, which many green groups blame for the clearing of forests for plantations.

Emissions race

According to analysis by research coalition Climate Action Tracker, Indonesia's current climate policies are “highly insufficient” and emissions are still climbing.

Indonesia was one of only five countries that started new coal-power plant construction in 2020, it noted.

“The government must introduce policy to reduce total emissions in order to meet the Paris climate goals, but the emissions in Indonesia are on an upwards trajectory,” said Sisilia Nurmala Dewi, Indonesia team leader at climate campaign group 350.org.

The government has, nonetheless, worked in recent years to stop illegal logging, protect its carbon-storing forests and meet its international pledges to tackle climate change.

Besides introducing a moratorium on new forest clearance, in the past five years it has allocated on average nearly 90-trillion rupiah ($6.4bn) a year to tackle climate change, though that dropped to about 80-trillion rupiah in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

New laws to cut red tape and boost investment and mining that introduced in 2020 were criticised by environmentalists, who said they would fuel more forest-clearing and fires.

WALHI's Harmono called on the government to stop issuing new permits for coal mining, ban coal-power plants, cease oil exploration and prepare green energy transition policies for the next 10-15 years that prioritise renewables.

“Developed countries should increase their (emissions reduction) commitments by three or four times — but for developing countries like Indonesia, we also have to be included in that race to increase our ambition,” he said.

According to the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), 54,950 houses were flooded, and over 70,000 were displaced.

The floods inundated all but 1 of Kalimantan’s 13 districts, the worst affected being Balangan, Banjar, Barito Kuala, Central Hulu Sungai, and Tanah Laut with 209,884 hectares of agricultural land being destroyed, according to the Indonesian Farmers Union. Most of the land was active farmland, comprising rice fields, agriculture and fish farming ponds.

Floodwaters also disabled 21 bridges, including the main bridge in Mataraman District, Banjar Regency, hampering rescue efforts. Government officials have described them as the worst foods to hit the province in 50 years.

Initial estimates by the Agency for The Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) report total economic losses of 1.349 Rupiah ($US96.1 million), factoring in long term effects and remediation.

The events occurred in what has been a destructive start of natural disasters to the new year. The BNPB reported a total of 185 natural disasters which had hit Indonesia in the first three weeks of 2021.

“Most are in the form of floods, hurricanes and landslides,” BNPB representative Professor Wiku stated in a press conference this week.

While this is a smaller number than last year, 166 people have died so far in January 2021, as compared to 91 from January 2020.

Weather reports indicate that heavy rains are expected to continue in South Kalimantan until February, and Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) has warned of an increase in “multiple disaster risks” up until March 2021.

President Joko Widodo travelled to the affected areas last week, inspecting damaged buildings, evacuation efforts and aid logistics. He stated that the floods were the unavoidable outcome of unusually high rainfall, causing the central Barito river to overflow.

His comments prompted rebukes from environmental scientists and advocates, who pointed to the devastating effects of deforestation from palm oil and mining operations. Such activities had led to a reduction in the storage capacity of the Barito River watershed, leading to more destructive flooding.

Indonesia is the largest producer of palm oil in the world, which is used in many household products. In 2019, Indonesia produced an estimated 48.42 million metric tons of crude palm oil.

Despite efforts to boycott the commodity, the Indonesian government is proceeding with a plan to develop domestic fuel sourced entirely from its palm oil plantations. Currently the biodiesel blend (B30) sold at gas stations contains 30 percent palm oil. In order to better meet domestic fuel demand, the government estimates it will need to establish 15 million hectares of new plantations.

In an interview with Tempo magazine, Indonesian Forum for the Environment (WALHI) of South Kalimantan Director, Kisworo Dwi Cahyono, stated, “If [the President] only blames the rain, it would have been better that he had not come here.”

“South Kalimantan stretches 3.7 million hectares that has 13 regencies and cities, but is burdened by 50 percent mining permits, 33 percent are palm oil fields,” he stated, adding that such an ecological disaster had been repeatedly warned about by the area’s branch office.

“The government is yet again ill-prepared. The people are once again who must bear the consequences,” said Kisworo.

Arie Rompas from the Indonesian section of Greenpeace echoed these concerns to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), stating that floods and landslides were among the chief natural disasters in recent years.

“It’s strongly related to the accumulated damage to forests that have an impact on climate change,” he said.

The government’s own research agency, BPPT, confirmed these assessments when it stated that a reduction in high density vegetation in upstream areas had compromised water storage functions, according to the Indonesian Nusa Daily.

In 2019, 324,000 hectares of primary forest was cleared, according to Global Forest Watch. Since 2001 this brings the total land cleared to 9.4 million hectares of primary forest.

In South Kalimantan, two thirds of the natural forest in its water catchment area has been cleared since 1991, according to government data cited by Mongabay, an environmental news website. Greenpeace has recorded a similar trend using satellite imagery which revealed that 304,000 hectares had been lost between 2001 and 2019.

As well as exacerbating the effects of flooding, the landscape has changed to one highly susceptible to landslides caused by erosion and fragile soil.

The government has doubled down on Widodo’s position, dismissing what it claims is “misinformation” and “invalid data” being pushed by other parties.

The environmental director at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Lana Saria, went so far as to say that mining activity in the region makes a positive contribution to the forests.

“It in fact improves the capability of the watershed to become a water catchment area,” she said.

Mining activity presents serious problems caused by acid mine drainage in which surface water reacts with rocks containing sulphur-bearing minerals, creating sulphuric acid. This can then leach away heavy metals from exposed rocks becoming highly toxic.

Calls for more stringent measures to protect the environment have fallen on deaf ears. Indonesia suffered its first recession in 20 years in the third quarter of 2020. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani estimated a GDP contraction of 1.7–2.2 per cent for 2020 earlier this year and projected a rebound of 4.5–5.5 per cent in 2021.

This rebound is contingent on the government’s strategy to scrap legislation for mining companies and plantations that will pave the way for the acceleration of deforestation.

Last year’s pro-business omnibus law, rammed through parliament despite popular opposition, revises 26 articles and shreds another seven from the 2014 Plantation Law. Most critical is the relaxing of environmental permits for developers, who are now given slap-on-the-wrist sanctions if found to be without permits and a three-year grace period to obtain them.

Environmental impact assessments are not required unless the operation is deemed to be “high risk”, and those found neglecting the environment or lacking firefighting equipment will not lose their permits.","Tue, 26 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.wsws.org/asset/5b979683-1c2e-4f2a-a246-83cc11459a46?rendition=image1280,"['flooding', 'oil', 'indonesian', 'deforestation', 'according', 'stated', 'million', 'indonesia', 'palm', 'kalimantan', 'south', 'hectares', 'water', 'linked', 'increased']",

Early 2021 was one of the most hectic months in recent times for natural disasters in Indonesia, with earthquakes hitting West Sulawesi, (Mamuju and Majene), floods in South Kalimantan and North Sulawesi (Manado and its surrounding areas) and landslides in Sumedang, West Java.

The disasters taking place in several areas almost at the same time caused damage to public infrastructure and forced people to flee from their homes, exacerbating the unfavorable situation brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Such disaster victims are in dire need of assistance.

In response to the disasters, PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) continually provides aid to the victims of natural disasters.

BRI Group, whose subsidiaries include BRI Agro, BRI Syariah, BRI Life, BRI Finance, BRI Insurance, BRI Danareksa Sekuritas, BRI Ventures, BRI Remittance, YBM BRI and PT Prima Karya Sarana Sejahtera (PKSS), has played an active role in providing aid to disaster-affected communities.

The actions that BRI Group has taken constitute the group’s caring and sincere endeavors to help the people and the country to arise and recover from the difficult times.

BRI corporate secretary Aestika Oryza Gunarto expressed a deep concern over the various disasters and said that BRI would continue to actively participate in helping the victims.

“BRI will continue to collaborate and coordinate with various parties to build a synergy in distributing the aid to the victims of the earthquakes in Majene and Mamuju, floods in several areas in South Kalimantan, in Kota Manado and its surrounding areas [North Sulawesi] and the landslides in Sumedang, West Java. This is a corporate endeavor to help relieve the burden of the people and accelerate the recovery [of the victims] in the post-disaster,” Aestika said.

. (./.)

BRI’s people engagement

The disasters have led to restricted transportation access and many people fleeing, which prompted employees of BRI Group in West Kalimantan, South Kalimantan and North Sulawesi to go on site to directly engage in distributing thousands of ready-to-eat food packages to the victims.

The thousands of distributed food packages were the early phase of aid, especially in the first several days after the disasters, in which the ready-to-eat food packages were desperately needed by the affected residents.

“Ready-to-eat foods are highly needed because an adequate number of public kitchens and emergency facilities are not available yet and besides, the electricity is cut off, leading to power outages. In distributing [the food packages], we engaged BRI Group people by adhering to the health protocols and keeping the victims safe,” said Aestika.

After rapidly distributing thousands of the food packages to victims of the disaster in the wake of the earthquakes in West Sulawesi and the floods in South Kalimantan and North Sulawesi, BRI also channeled natural disaster emergency response aid in the form of staple food packages, blankets, tents, medicines and other evacuation needs to the victims.

For the landslide victims in Cimanggung, Sumedang, West Java, BRI also distributed staple food packages and medicines. To accelerate the distribution of the aid from BRI Group, and also to improve the service to the victims and the refugees affected by the disaster, BRI Group built BRI Peduli posts in South Sulawesi (Mamuju and Majene).

. (./.)

Meanwhile in West Kalimantan and North Sulawesi, BRI group set up synergy with other state-owned enterprises (BUMN) and other relevant parties through the formation of BUMN Disaster Taskforce Teams in the respective areas.

“We continue to build synergy with local provincial administrations and other state-owned enterprises to work hand-in-hand to help alleviate the burden of the people affected by the earthquakes,” Aestika added.

In several areas where transportation access and infrastructure/facilities are severely affected by the disaster, BRI keeps operating and providing services in a normal manner.

BRI also provides mobile serves like E-Buzz and Mobile BRI Teras in particular areas that need banking services. Apart from that, the public can also still make transactions normally through BRI e-channels, such as ATMs and CRMs up to BRILink agents. Even in a number of affected areas, BRI is the only bank that provides service for the public.

With no end in sight to the coronavirus pandemic that has infected, sickened and killed nearly a million people, and with looming ecological disasters, some of them man-made, the last thing we need is a government that pays little regard to science. Unfortunately, this could be the grim reality in Indonesia today.

Within the first weeks of 2021, Indonesia has had to deal with a new spike in coronavirus cases across Java, deadly earthquakes in Mamuju and Majene, both in West Sulawesi, and the worst flooding to hit South Kalimantan in decades. It is as if 2021 were saying “hold my beer” to us after being compared to the annus horribilis that is 2020.

32,32,FL-2021-000005-IDN,Climate and disaster resilience in Indonesia: “We have made our mark” - Indonesia - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/indonesia/climate-and-disaster-resilience-indonesia-we-have-made-our-mark,"Cordaid has phased out its climate and disaster resilience projects in Indonesia. Time for aid coordinator Yohan Santosa to look back, as well as ahead. “We have made our mark. Cordaid contributed to Jakarta’s 2018-2030 climate change adaptation policy. And the emergency response partners we trained now operate successfully as a network.”

In the past decade, Cordaid's efforts in Indonesia focused heavily on increasing people's abilities to adapt to climate change and to bounce back during and after natural disasters like floods and earthquakes. And whenever needed, like in Sulawesi in 2018, in Lombok the same year, or Aceh in December 2016, Cordaid supported Indonesian relief organisations' emergency responses.

The recent earthquake in Sulawesi is yet another reminder of how beleaguered the country is when it comes to catastrophes.

Nevertheless, per January 2021, Cordaid has phased out its disaster risk reduction and resilience programmes in Indonesia -- work that was done in close alliance with Partner for Resilience. The main reason for this is the strategic choice to operate more in conflict-affected parts of the world that appear higher on the fragility index. But this will not keep us from providing humanitarian assistance in Indonesia when needed and called upon.

""Over the years we succeeded better in connecting and integrating our operations.""

Since 2014, Yohan Santosa was Cordaid's key person in Indonesia. Based in Yogyakarta, he coordinated our responses and projects in Aceh, Sulawesi, Jakarta, Timor, East Nusa Tenggara, and other parts of the immense Indonesian archipelago. From Yogyakarta, he looks back on his years with Cordaid.

What stands out for you, in terms of achievements?

The fact that the Emergency Response Capacity Building Network will continue to play an important humanitarian role on a national level, even now that Cordaid is retreating. We have trained many of the Indonesian member organisations in increasing their response capacities and supported them in forging this network. They first acted as a humanitarian network after the 2016 earthquake in Aceh, and have stepped up their efforts ever since, in assisting communities, in raising funds, and in advocating for better emergency response policies. Today, they are a strong mid-size player in Indonesia. And I believe they will grow bigger in the future. Without Cordaid the ERCB network, consisting of Bina Swadaya, Caritas Indonesia, Pusaka, and others, would not exist.

Is this an example of localising humanitarian aid?

It is. Not a perfect example, but a good one. The ERCB is a network of national NGOs. They, in turn, work closely with more grassroots level organisations. On that level, the means to operate and response capacities are still minimal. Cordaid as an INGO is now stepping back, and national ERCB members will need to strengthen the smaller aid organisations, who often stand in the humanitarian frontline in communities that are hit by disasters.

Any other successes that come to mind?

There are many. Over the years we succeeded better in connecting and integrating our operations. Our Partners for Resilience alliance, as well as Anat Prag, Cordaid's Country Director in The Philippines with whom I collaborated closely, were instrumental in this. In Central Sulawesi, for example, we aligned our humanitarian efforts with our resilience and advocacy programs. Saving lives went hand in hand with increasing people's livelihoods as well as our advocacy and policy influencing activities.

Disaster risk reduction, securing livelihoods, promoting gender equality, and climate adaptation are all connected. We tried and sometimes succeeded in integrating these aspects. More recently, we adapted and integrated a Covid-19 response into our health system strengthening work. Creating a web of interlinked efforts, creating networks -- also with the private sector, showing flexibility and adaptivity... I think we managed to do that.

Can you give an example that shows the interconnection of gender equality and livelihood?

Take the farmers in East Nusa Tenggara. We supported them in improving their vegetable production and in adapting to climate change. This was successful to a large degree because of the gender equality component of the programme. As long as female farmers are the only ones to have a double load, taking care of the kids, and providing an income, there's inequality. Sharing roles and burdens counters inequality and strengthens communities, in their livelihood, and in addressing climate change.

Climate change adaptation was key in a lot of our resilience projects. Can you tell us a bit more about that?

Marunda, one of the poorest areas of the Jakarta urban area, comes first to mind. As you know, Jakarta is one of the fastest sinking cities in the world. And the people in Marunda, living in flooded slums, are the first to feel the consequences of this. From 2015 onwards, we supported them in introducing and improving urban organic farming, rainwater harvesting, and waste management techniques.

""I still teach and train, not in classrooms any longer, but in disaster areas.""

We didn't solve the flooding -- hopefully the big sea wall project will not only protect Jakarta's rich but also the people of Marunda -- but we did manage to increase food and water security in a sustainable way. And to assist communities in turning the waste that floats everywhere into either organic fertilizer or non-organic sources of income.

Our climate-smart agriculture programme in Timor, the island in East Nusa Tenggara, is another example. With farming communities, we developed and implemented techniques to recharge, retain and reuse rainwater.

You mentioned the giant Sea Wall project in Jakarta. It is one example of how this sinking metropolis is trying to address climate change. The city also called upon Cordaid to contribute to its 2018-2030 climate change policies. How did that come about?

Our bottom-up work with the Marunda communities gained the attention of the Jakarta Deputy Governor of Spatial and Environment. The Jakarta government was impressed by the community-based and climate-smart approach in the slums of the city and invited us to contribute to Jakarta's Urban Farming Grand Design 2018-2030 to address climate change and food security.

""Big disasters are the scenes of extreme hardship, grief, and resilience. But they also mean big business. This is inevitable if you need to reach out and provide life-saving assistance to thousands of people. At all times, you need to make sure that as much money as possible goes to those who need it most.""

We started doing this in 2017 and Cordaid's Marunda approach and our learnings are now integrated into the city's long-term urban farming policy for climate change adaptation. It shows how our work with and amidst some of the hardest-hit communities was a solid basis to influence policymaking on the highest levels.

Cordaid has a history in Indonesia. Apart from our emergency responses, we focused on disaster resilience and risk reduction in the past decade, and microfinance and other forms of support even before that. Cordaid decided to end our structural development projects as of this year. Is it the right decision at the right time?

Cordaid took the decision carefully. It chooses to operate in the most fragile, conflict-prone parts of the world. Indonesia, a middle-income country, ranks in the lower half of the world's fragility index. The decision makes sense. But poverty is still rampant in a lot of communities. And I do hope Cordaid will remain in touch with Indonesia. Not as an implementing agency, structural donor, or capacity builder. There are enough strong Indonesian implementing and capacity building agencies and Cordaid has contributed to that, as I said before. But Cordaid could still act as an investor in Indonesia and put its knowledge and networks to good use.

You joined Cordaid in 2014. What are your personal highlights of the past 6 years?

For me, being a humanitarian is a highlight in itself. I started doing this work after the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake. Being from Yogyakarta myself, I felt the need to roll up my sleeves when that disaster hit my city. Before that, I used to teach English at University. I still teach and train, not in classrooms any longer, but in disaster areas, increasing people's emergency response and climate adaptation skills. And working a lot with INGOs, my English still comes in handy.

Joining Cordaid was the start of a steep learning curve for me. The knowledge, the talents, and the needs of the communities come first. They are the basis to reduce risks, increase resilience, and influence policies. Doing this with colleagues at Global Office in The Hague, and sharing experiences with Cordaid counterparts in Kenya, South Sudan, DRC, Afghanistan, Philippines, Myanmar, and feeling supported by them, was very valuable, professionally as well as personally.

Any takeaways?

Just a reminder. Big disasters are the scenes of extreme hardship, grief, and resilience. But they also mean big business, big contracts. This is inevitable if you need to reach out and provide life-saving assistance to thousands of people in isolated situations, under extreme time pressure. At all times, you need to make sure that as much money as possible goes to those who need it most. Monitoring your operations with this in mind is of extreme importance.

What are your plans for the future?

In fact, together with ex-Cordaid staff, all from Indonesia, we have started our own disaster resilience and risk reduction NGO. We are no longer tied to The Hague but operate independently. In a sense, we are capitalizing on our time with Cordaid and now we move on without them.","Tue, 26 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/earthquake.png,"['mark', 'cordaid', 'need', 'climate', 'communities', 'response', 'humanitarian', 'indonesia', 'change', 'resilience', 'disaster']",

Kisworo said that the area's Walhi branch office had repeatedly warned about South Kalimantan’s emergency regarding land mass and potential ecological disasters.

“South Kalimantan stretches 3.7 million hectares that has 13 regencies and cities, but is burdened by 50 percent mining permits, 33 percent are palm oil fields,” Kisworo asserted on Sunday, January 17.

He explained that it leaves only 17 percent without South Kalimantan’s land masses free from any industrial or business land-use permits. The majority of areas are facing impending ecological disasters as the disastrous flooding that hit the region had been predicted by the BMKG weather forecasts all along.

To prevent similar natural disasters from ruining Kalimantan in the future, the Walhi executive called for the government to evaluate and rethink issuing permits for extractive industries, stopping newly granted permits, and better enforcement of the law on environmental blighters in preventing another future ecological disaster.

“The government is yet again ill-prepared. The people are once again who must bear the consequences,” said Kisworo.

The waves, along with the massive floods and landslides, claimed the lives of six people, causing some 40,000 people to be evacuated.

The tragedy struck following heavy rain on January 16, 2021.

Dramatic.

Many have taken to social media to show just how scary the entire incident was.

One video on Instagram reveals how the massive waves hit a coast, causing people fleeing for their lives.

Here's what caused the tidal waves.

According to Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency (BMKG), the 4 meter high waves were caused due to low air pressure over the Celebes Sea located north of the city.

The unusually strong winds also caused the extreme weather.

BKMG has urged people to remain cautious as the area is set to experience tumultuous weather conditions with possibly even higher waves.

Blaming nature alone for calamities such as floods and landslides is irresponsible and dangerous. This shift in blame ignores the decades of plundering of forests and exploitation of natural resources that have likely worsened these disasters.

The government’s unanimous denial that mass deforestation and the designation of green areas for purposes other than environmental conservation were key factors behind the recent flooding in South Kalimantan shows the state’s disavowal of its responsibility to protect nature, in addition to its distrust of science.

It is true that Jakarta, which sits on a low, flat basin, is prone to flooding. History shows that such disasters date back to at least the fifth century in the area.

Agency spokesperson Raditya said health protocols would continue to be enforced amid the ongoing emergency in the wake of earthquakes in West Sulawesi, major flooding in South Kalimantan and deadly landslides in West Java.

“All health protocols must be implemented,” he told an online press conference on Sunday.

Often called as the lungs of Southeast Asia, it now depicts a tragic tale of greed and destruction.

I was born here and spent half of my life in Indonesia’s third-largest island. Borneo is a treasure chest teeming with biodiversity, one of the highest in the world. Its natural environment also stores an enormous amount of carbon.

It is no wonder then that companies saw Borneo’s vast potential and descended upon the island to start their ventures. Unfortunately, their business models were focused on infinite growth and prosperity, not on environmental sustainability.

A history of corporate greed and government negligence

The province of South Kalimantan covers an area of 3.7 million hectares. Around 1.7 million hectares, or 33 percent of the area, have been allocated for coal mining concessions. Permits for palm oil plantations cover an area of 618 thousand hectares, or 17 percent of the area, a small portion was allocated to pulp concessions.

At least 30 percent of Borneo’s tropical forest have been destroyed over the last 40 years, including its carbon-rich peatlands that can store twice as much carbon as forests. Logging, mining, and plantation development, especially from palm oil plantations have contributed to massive deforestation and impacting the island’s orangutan population. To date, Borneo has lost nearly 150,000 orangutans over the last 16 years.

Indigenous communities have also been severely affected and displaced. The Dayak people, one of the island’s original inhabitants, heavily rely on the forest for their livelihood. Now, their culture and way of life are threatened because of corporate greed and lack of government support.

The devastating fires that occurred in 2015 and 2019 are forever etched in people’s memory, resulting in almost 4.4 million ha of forests and peatlands burned. The plantation sector bears considerable responsibility for the fires between 2015 and 2019, with 27 percent of the mapped burned areas in 2019 located in palm oil and pulpwood concessions.

A climate emergency in Borneo

At the start of 2021, amidst the Covid -19 pandemic, Borneo found itself in the news with the widespread floodings in South Kalimantan. Unlike the recent devastating earthquake in Sulawesi, the floodings were triggered by a series of events that could have been prevented by the Indonesian government.

Throughout the years, the government continued to issue company permits in a haphazard manner resulting in Borneo’s watershed areas being severely deforested. With very little forest cover, South Kalimantan is highly susceptible to floods given the amount of rainfall that occurs during mid January. Heavy rains triggered landslides and caused heavy flooding in at least 10 districts, claiming 20 lives and affecting more than 300,000 people according to the latest National Disaster Management Agency’s report.

President Joko Widodo, who recently visited the impacted areas, stated that the high rainfall was to blame for Borneo’s devastating floods, the worst one to hit the province in 50 years.

This statement is a confusing narrative often used by the government to escape responsibility for forest fires and floods. Clearly, it is more convenient to blame the weather than to take stock of what has happened to Borneo. Nevermind that many companies operating in Borneo have little or no regard for the environment and often take advantage of the province’s land and forest conversion. It is important to note that most of the palm oil and mining concession permits are concentrated in areas where severe flooding occurred.

In all of this, the Indonesian government chose to ignore the environmental crisis despite Borneo being highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. [1]

What is obvious is this: the government failed to implement spatial planning as well as forest and environmental protection policies, while allowing companies to take advantage of this situation

The oligarchy’s interests have effectively weakened the state’s function by depriving the public of their rights, namely the right to a healthy environment regulated in the constitution and the democratic rights. The floods occurred after the government issued a controversial policy- passing the Mining Law and granting special privileges to mining entrepreneurs. [2]

The new Omnibus Law, hastily passed by the government, eliminates many articles on environmental protection. This now opens up Borneo to future disasters. [3] What is most alarming is the removal of the 30 percent minimum requirement needed to protect the watershed’s carrying capacity. This will lead to more forest conversion, granting permits to palm oil, mining and other concessions.

A need for a green and just recovery

All my life, I have been campaigning to save the environment and my beloved Borneo. In 2015, I took part in a people’s initiative- we filed and won a lawsuit against President Jokowi and five ministers for their negligence in handling the forest fires and haze. But this is not enough. We need more people to remain vigilant and pressure the government and companies to change the current economic model that relies on the destruction of nature for economic growth.

Despite the social distancing, let us be united to protect Borneo. We must stand together against this destructive and unjust system if we are to weather natural disasters and the climate emergency.

Public health and planetary health are closely linked and must be handled together. We appeal to both the Indonesian government and the business sector to prioritize people and the planet as they rebuild the economy and society from Covid-19. Indonesia must invest in Renewable Energy and shift away from fossil fuels.

Above all, emphasis must be given to protect Indonesian forests- change current agricultural practices and radically redesign our cities, including transforming land-based industries that destroy our forests and peatlands. Failure to do so will have devastating consequences, not just for Indonesia but for the rest of the world. We must protect Borneo because our lives depend on it.

NOTES:

[1] The relationship between deforestation and changes in local climate was most pronounced in watersheds in southeast Borneo, which have lost 40%–75% of their forests since 1973. These watersheds also had a significantly higher frequency of temperatures above 31 ◦C.

Watersheds in north and northwest Borneo, which have lost 5%–25% of their forest cover, maintained a more stable climate with a similar distribution of mean and extreme warm temperatures between forest and modified forest areas. Watersheds with >15% forest loss had a >15% reduction in rainfall. This situation concluded that the loss of forest in Borneo has increased local daily temperatures and temperature extremes, and reduced daily precipitation.

[2] By exempting royalty payments of up to zero percent, including providing guaranteed business permits for life for mining companies that add value and remove maximum boundaries, so that they can freely expand and increase their production capacity. The mining companies that benefit are mostly operating in the South Borneo region, and their owners are connected to oligarchs in Indonesia.

[3] The previous Forestry Law required the total forested area within each river basin and/or island to be maintained at 30% of the total land area. This was to minimize disturbance to the water system, and to prevent floods, erosion, sedimentation and water shortages. This requirement has been removed by the Omnibus Law.","Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.greenpeace.org/static/planet4-international-stateless/2021/01/02dbd474-gp1surzb.jpg,"['borneo', 'oil', 'indonesian', 'floods', 'mining', 'forest', 'kalimantan', 'palm', 'land', 'south', 'environmental', 'crisis']", 
40,40,FL-2021-000005-IDN,How can Indonesia break its vicious cycle of cheap imports? - World Economic Forum,https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/01/indonesia-local-entrepreneurs-small-medium-business/,"Pak Iyus is a hijab producer in Bandung, Indonesia. At the height of his business between 2015 and 2017, he was able to produce 150,000 garments per day; however, his production has declined by 80%, resulting in a massive reduction in income for his employees. His change in fortunes comes as a by-product of imports flooding the market, sometimes illegally. According to officials at Tanah Abang wholesale market in Jakarta, the biggest in south-east Asia, the share of local products sold there has reduced from 80% in the early 2000s to 50% now.

Trade practices affect people like Pak Iyus disproportionately; big fluctuations in sales correspond closely with the amount of imported products circulating in the market. He has also noticed that foreign manufacturers observe which products in Indonesia are in high demand, and within six months, flood the market with similar but cheaper products. To compete, he must then come up with a new winning product to increase his sales, and when that happens he only has up to six months to capitalize. He accepts that his global counterparts use market intelligence to gain an unfair advantage to shorten his winning product life-cycle, yet he has no strategic plan to respond. Because of the limited time to capitalize on any investment or innovation, he is very reluctant to expand his business.

This process is the start of a vicious cycle typical among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia: cheaper imported products on the market result in SMEs’ reluctance to invest into medium- to long-term initiatives, which in turn results in low productivity and production inefficiency (limiting growth) and makes them unable to compete with global players. This vicious cycle at SME level creates another, smaller, vicious cycle for the individual employee: Low productivity of the SME decreases household income, which in turn results in a reduction of spending by the household for their children’s education, creating more low-skilled workers who later on will rely heavily on SMEs to provide income.

The current system discourages small Indonesian businesses from investing in growth. Image: Evermos

Moreover, imports also have a real impact in terms of loss of potential earnings to the community. One container of hijab imports typically has 250,000-450,000 hijabs per container. To produce 150,000 hijabs a month, Pak Iyus employed a network of 3,600 households across the city. The total income for each household was $235, equal to three times the minimum wage. Because of declining production because of imports, the potential total loss of earnings to the community is $678,000 a month. In the meantime, one container is taxed by the government between $44,000-93,000. When we buy local, the circulation of money is faster and can be used more efficiently to keep the local economy alive.

Without local consumption of local products, SMEs will lose more and more in competition with the global value chain. Even though a survey of local customer preferences shows preferability of local brands over foreign brands for clothing products, in reality it does not automatically translate into higher sales for local producers. Yet there is so much at stake when customers don’t buy local. SMEs make up 97% of employment in Indonesia, absorbing the majority of the country’s low-skilled workers. They also contribute 60% of Indonesia’s GDP, and have resulted in mass-scale improvement of the quality of life, and elevated millions out of poverty. The opportunities of extending the benefit of local production are immense because Indonesia has a large, growing market hungry for greater quantities and varieties of products. But we have not yet been able to translate this into a prosperous reality.

Change can come at one or many points Image: Evermos

The current question is: How can we break the vicious cycle that many Indonesians are in? It works like a continuous chain and to break it, we must focus on single parts of the chain by doing one or all of the following:

1. Go local or go home. Inspire Indonesians to buy local products even when there are other cheaper alternative products

2. Invest for the long run. Stimulate SMEs to invest in medium- to long-term initiatives despite getting bombarded by global products

3. Productivity as the engine of growth. Focus on skills training and technology adoption to drive productivity up

4. Defense is the best offense. Create a local ecosystem with effective trade policies that can protect SMEs and employ a more data-driven, market intelligent approach

A reformed system could lead to higher productivity and profits. Image: Evermos

If we can successfully break any part of the chain, we would kickstart a virtuous cycle where Indonesian products are desirable, and in which SMEs would be more willing to invest in medium- and long-term growth. This would result in higher productivity, efficiency and profit and in turn make local products can compete with global products. Another approach is to have a giant leap by breaking the cycle of our heavy reliance on SMEs and focusing on improving our skilled workforce, converting them from low-skill to high-skill workers.

JAKARTA, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) -- Most of Indonesia's territories have entered the peak of the rainy season, the Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency said on Wednesday.

""Currently, 94 percent of the 342 zones in Indonesia have entered the peak of extreme weather,"" the agency's head Dwikorita Karnawati said.

Areas that have entered the peak of the rainy season are mainly those in Java, Bali, South Sulawesi, and Nusa Tenggara.

The agency estimated that the peak will occur from January to February.

Karnawati said that the extreme weather in Indonesia happens due to the strengthening of the Asian monsoon which could be accompanied by cross-equatorial wind flows in the Karimata Strait.

The extreme weather, Karnawati continued, also occurred due to the tropical equatorial atmosphere waves including Madden-Julian Oscillation waves, Rossby waves, and cyclonic circulation in southern Indonesia and northern Australia.

""Extreme weather can cause hydrometeorological disasters such as floods, flash floods, landslides, high waves that can endanger shipping, and aviation (activities),"" added Karnawati.

The agency also predicted four to six meters high waves in the Natuna waters, Riau Islands province.

There is also the potential for the formation of Cumulonimbus clouds that could endanger aviation activities. Enditem","Wed, 20 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",,"['extreme', 'territories', 'weather', 'season', 'peak', 'xinhua', 'indonesia', 'entered', 'agency', 'indonesias', 'rainy', 'enter', 'waves']",

The miners produce thermal coal with calorific values from 3,000-5,200 kcal/kg NAR, the sources said.

""The flood has slowed down the production of coal, creating delay to some shipments,"" a South Kalimantan miner said. ""We have stopped offering to the market amid tightening supply.""

Miners in East Kalimantan were also experiencing loading delays and slower production, with Multi Hara Utama and Insani Baraperkasahas having declared force majeure on Jan. 5 and Jan. 17, respectively, sources said.

That has led to expectations of a supply crunch, buoying the Indonesian coal market at a time of solid demand from China.

43,43,FL-2021-000005-IDN,"Indonesia and ASEAN usher in a new era of disaster readiness, response, and risk reduction - PDC Global",https://www.pdc.org/indonesia-drms-hand-over/,"Indonesia’s national government, the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre), and Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) recently celebrated the completion of two life-saving technology projects. More than 70 stakeholders representing multiple ASEAN member states (AMS) and numerous national and international organizations attended the virtual InAWARE and Disaster Monitoring and Response System (DMRS) handover ceremony—marking the beginning of a new era of disaster management capacity throughout the ASEAN region.

Developed in partnership with funding support from USAID and its Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, the technologies known as InAWARE and DMRS have been customized for the specific needs of Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Organization (NDMO) Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana (BNPB) and the regional AHA Centre, respectively. Both systems support hazard monitoring, disaster response, regional cooperation, and early warning.

“It’s been a privilege for the AHA Centre to work with Pacific Disaster Center under the ASEAN–U.S. cooperation since our birth, nine years ago. DMRS is powered by PDC’s DisasterAWARE technology and has been internalized and mainstreamed for the past nine years into our day-to-day disaster monitoring and response operation,” said AHA Centre Executive Director Adelina Kamal. “It has allowed us to perform our key function as the operational coordination engine for the ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response,” Kamal explained.

The head of BNPB’s Emergency Operations Center Bambang Surya Putra dovetailed with Kamal’s remarks saying the partnership with the AHA Centre and PDC has been key for their operations. “We have been able to use InAWARE for our COVID-19 response, improving the quality of our operations, linking field and manager level, and helping up provide good information to the public.” He said that InAWARE is the richest information source Indonesia has and, “we must continue to work side by side with our partners to further enhance the use of InAWARE within BNPB and BPBDs.”

The vital importance of partnership and cooperation for effective disaster risk reduction was brought to light during the handover ceremony with the attendance of numerous project partners. These included Indonesia’s provincial disaster management agencies (BPBDs), Indonesian government ministries, AMS NDMOs, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap (HOT), Yayasan Peta Bencana (YPB), the World Bank, and others. Since their initial deployments, both the InAWARE and DMRS systems have undergone significant upgrades through these partnerships, including the integration of crowdsourcing disaster data from YPB and critical lifeline data from HOT into InAWARE. Major modifications were also completed to extend use of DMRS to other AMS through language and data customizations.

PDC’s Deputy Executive Director Chris Chiesa highlighted the successes and outcomes of the InAWARE and DMRS projects, including:

Deployment and customization of InAWARE and upgrade of DMRS in line with PDC’s DisasterAWARE®;

Training of more than 1200 BNPB and BPBD staff in the use of InAWARE and 18 AHA Centre Executive (ACE) Program participants from across ASEAN in the use of DMRS;

Cultivation of a cadre of 62 BNPB and BPBD InAWARE trainers;

The development of DMRS and InAWARE eLearning platforms;

Integration of regional, national, and subnational data from authoritative sources into both InAWARE and DMRS; and

Synchronization of hazard data between DMRS and InAWARE.

According to Chiesa, although both projects with PDC are drawing to a close, the relationships with its partners are stronger than ever and will persist well into the future. Chiesa’s sentiments were echoed by PDC’s Executive Director Ray Shirkhodai who stated, “it’s a privilege to have had the opportunity to work with so many of the people joining us today. We see these relationships, developed over many years, as lasting partnerships and we look forward to continued engagement with you all.”

Closing the event, USAID Bureau of Humanitarian Affairs Regional Advisor Harlan Hale further highlighted the importance of the partnerships developed during the projects. “Thinking about where we’ve all started together and where we are today, I wanted to speak to the power of partnership. The partnership between USAID, BNPB, AHA Centre, PDC, and all the partners including HOT, and Yayasan Peta Bencana, it’s remarkable to look and see what organizations with a common purpose, a common objective can do together, blending together their comparative advantages from government, nongovernment, education, and academia.”

Linkedin Patrick Galey (Agence France-Presse) Paris ● Sun, January 17, 2021 19:33 135 0920e6703081f028872405a5260c2e9d 2 World climate-change,environment,UN,adaptation,agriculture Free

The world is falling short of promises made under the Paris climate deal to help the most vulnerable nations deal with the increasingly devastating impacts of climate change, according to the United Nations.

Adaptation -- reducing the fallout among communities and increasing their capacity to deal with climate-related disasters such as floods and drought -- is a pillar of the landmark 2015 accord, which aims to chart a path away from catastrophic warming.

The deal requires signatories to implement adaptation measures through national planning, but also through funding to at-risk countries.

The UN Environment Programme Adaptation Gap report found that the current finance levels of around $30 billion annually for adaptation fell far short of the annual cost in developing nations of $70 billion.

It said the true cost of adapting to climate impacts in these nations could be as high as $300 billion every year by the end of the decade and $500 billion by mid-century.

""The hard truth is that climate change is upon us,"" said Inger Andersen, UNEP executive director.

""Its impacts will intensify and hit vulnerable countries and communities the hardest -- even if we meet the Paris Agreement goals of holding global warming this century to well below 2C.""

UNEP called for a drastic scale-up of public and private finance for adaptation, as well as increased investment in nature-based solutions such as protecting and sustainably restoring ecosystems.

With just over 1C of warming since the start of the industrial era, Earth is already experiencing more intense and frequent extreme weather such as droughts and flooding, as well as storms supercharged by rising seas.

Much of the devastation wrought by climate-linked disasters falls on developing nations, and despite promises to help out financially, richer countries still aren't hitting their adaptation funding targets.

UNEP said funding for adaptation currently represented just five percent of all climate finance.

With the cost of natural disasters set to skyrocket this century, hard-hit nations are finding it difficult to secure the finance to rebuild after extreme events.

Mozambique, which was battered by twin cyclones in early 2019, said that one year since the disasters it had received less than a quarter of the estimated $3 billion it needed to recover.

The UN report found that cutting greenhouse gas emissions will provide a long-term economic benefit by reducing the costs associated with climate change.

Achieving the 2C Paris Agreement temperature rise limit could curb losses in annual growth to 1.6 percent, compared with 2.2 percent for 3C of warming -- the current trajectory if nations' current Paris pledges are upheld.

Under the deal's ""ratchet"" mechanism, countries are supposed to file new emissions reduction plans -- known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs -- every five years.

The deadline for the first round of new NDC submissions was December 31, 2020. However just 71 countries representing under a third of global emissions have done so.

UNEP says global emissions must fall 7.6 percent annually this decade to keep the more ambitious Paris temperature target of 1.5C in play.","Sun, 17 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/09/25/2020_09_25_104834_1601026456._large.jpg,"['nations', 'disasters', 'paris', 'climate', 'countries', 'deal', 'warming', 'billion', 'emissions', 'failing', 'adaptation', 'fund']",

The initiative was launched on the directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, with the monitoring of H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Ruler's Representative in the Al Dhafra Region and Chairman of the Emirates Red Crescent (ERC), to support those affected by the earthquake and offer them urgent relief aid.

The ERC implemented the directives of the leadership by preparing an ambitious relief programme, which aims to provide large quantities of shelter materials, food, medical supplies and other basic needs to thousands of people affected by the disaster.

The ERC coordinated with the UAE Embassy in Jakarta and relevant Indonesian authorities to ensure the fast delivery of the aid, to meet the needs of those affected by the disaster, improve their conditions and ease their burdens.

An ERC delegation recently arrived in Indonesia to oversee the relief operations and distribute humanitarian aid in the affected island.

Dr. Mohammed Ateeq Al Falahi, Secretary-General of the ERC, stated that the UAE’s leadership is always keen to consolidate the country’s regional and international humanitarian and development role in providing needy people and those affected by various disasters with required aid.

The ERC, under the leadership of Sheikh Hamdan, is always ready to rapidly respond to similar crises and disasters, Al Falahi added, affirming that the ERC has been present in Indonesia since the 1990s and its office in Jakarta is among the first to be opened globally.

Therefore, the ERC is aware of the humanitarian conditions in Indonesia and works, in coordination with relevant authorities, to better serve affected areas, he further added.

The 6.2 magnitude earthquake that rocked Sulawesi was followed by heavy rainfall that flooded the Krueng Langsa river.

The floods affected many areas of the island and left thousands homeless, as well as damaged many houses, hospitals, schools and other services facilities.

The recent heavy rains in South Kalimantan displaced almost 250,000 people. It did not take long before opinions were channeled to that very dislocated destination, a black-and-white space that permits no gray areas.

The ensuing wave of headlines invited us to identify with some NGOs that believed that uncontrolled expansion of oil palm plantations and coal mines were solely to blame for degrading the function of the Barito watershed, which precipitated flooding in communities hundreds of miles downstream. Competing explanations pointed to the extremely high rainfall recorded, i.e., something out of our hands.

Both perspectives attempt to offer a quick analysis of the root cause of communities being displaced from their homes, and the facts are readily available for supporting all points of view.

The government is aiming at vaccinating two-thirds of the population to reach herd immunity, and Mr Widodo has set a deadline of 15 months for the programme to be completed.

But the sheer size of the population and its geographical extent - with 270 million citizens spreading across more than 17,000 islands - make the vaccination task a very challenging one.

Logistics aside, feedback from the ground also highlighted data mismatch error and vaccine scepticism, the latter of which is blamed on the lack of effective policy communication on the government's part.



Indonesia said it has secured more than 300 million doses of vaccines from various producers, and has so far received 3 million ready-to-use vaccines from China’s Sinovac Biotech and raw materials to produce 15 million doses of vaccines.

This Chinese-made vaccine works by using inactivated viral particles to expose the body's immune system to the virus. The jab must be stored in a cooler with a temperature of 2 to 8 degree Celsius and the vaccine requires two doses to be effective.

Indonesia has also said that it has secured 50 million doses from Pfizer-BioNTech, which require storage at minus 70 Celsius.



According to the government's plan, about 1.48 million health workers are first in line to receive the jab produced by China’s Sinovac Biotech.

Out of the total, 560,000 health workers in about 90 provincial capitals and regencies are expected to be vaccinated this month, while the remaining 900,000 are scheduled to receive the jab in February.

About 17.4 million public officers in the high-risk category will be next in line, followed by 21.5 million elderly in April and then workers between 18 and 59 years old. In total, more than 180 million people will be vaccinated.



For the initial rounds of inoculation, the government has distributed 1.2 million doses of Sinovac Biotech's CoronaVac to around 90 provincial capitals and regencies.



While the first week of vaccination has gone relatively smoothly, Dr Pandu Riono, an epidemiologist from the University of Indonesia warned that many challenges lie ahead.

“When the vaccination enters the phase for the general population, then obstacles will appear,” he said.



LOGISTICAL HURDLE TO BE ANTICIPATED

Logistics will be a major issue in vaccinating the general public, experts have pointed out.



Dr Riono said currently, only a small number of vaccines are sent to be distributed in areas that are more developed, so the problem is not apparent yet.



“But later, once the general population needs to be inoculated, a massive storage and distribution system is needed. We can’t use the existing distribution system,” he said.

Mr Yanuar Nugroho, a visiting senior fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, expressed concern that the programme would not run smoothly in areas where healthcare infrastructure and supporting infrastructure such as cold chain and storage are not readily available.

“For example, (there are) health centres where electricity is still limited. Vaccines need a refrigerator. (There are also) areas where health workers are not distributed evenly,"" he said.



Mr Nugroho, who is also the former deputy chief of staff to the president in Mr Widodo’s first term, suggested the government to work together with the private sector on the distribution and storage of the vaccines.



Dr Riono believed this could be a solution, but stressed that valid and reliable data is needed or it would not work.



DATA DISCREPANCIES

While it has been reported in local media that the vaccination is running smoothly in capital Jakarta and Bali’s capital Denpasar, there are places that are grappling with data discrepancies.



Mr Edward Sihotang, the health department secretary in Papua's Jayapura regency, said about 1,300 health workers are expected to be vaccinated and they have already received 2,730 doses of vaccine.

However, only about 400 health workers are listed on the government app used for the vaccination programme.

Mr Sihotang believed that this happened because the data has not been updated.

“In my opinion, actually, if we encourage the relevant parties to input their data accurately, there won't be any problem. It's just because everything is rushed, it’s not satisfactory,"" he told CNA.

He said the solution is for the health workers to proactively register themselves if they are not listed in the database.

Meanwhile, in North Kalimantan province, secretary of the provincial health department Andarias Baso told CNA they have a vaccine oversupply because there are health workers who cannot be vaccinated due to their health conditions, which have not been reflected in the database.



In response, the government’s spokeswoman for COVID-19 handling and vaccination Siti Nadia Tarmizi told CNA that overall the vaccination has been smooth. However, she acknowledged there have been some minor shortcomings.

""We have a few obstacles related to the registration process which we previously did with the application PeduliLindungi. There were a few problems, also related to the recording and reporting system.

""They are still not well connected, so there are still little hiccups in the vaccination process but we have anticipated this,"" she said.

To overcome this issue, the government has asked all health workers, regardless of whether they have received an electronic ticket or not, to go to their respective health facilities to get vaccinated, she said.

Mdm Tarmizi added that the vaccination programme is on hold for now in regions which are currently dealing with disasters, such as West Sulawesi which is grappling with the aftermath of a quake and South Kalimantan with floods.

However, Dr Riono, the epidemiologist, said the mismatch in data is hindering the speed of the vaccination programme.

“This can’t be tolerated. Why? Because we knew since a long time ago that the medical workers are first in line. But the database has never been fixed,” he said.



VACCINE FEARS NOT EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSED

Even though the vaccination programme has kicked off officially, there are health workers who remain wary of the effectiveness of the new vaccines.

Indonesia's late-stage clinical trial on the Sinovac vaccine showed an efficacy of 65.3 per cent but some medical staff are not convinced. Some are also cautious of the side effects.

The hoaxes that have been circulating on social media do not help either.

In Indonesia’s westernmost province Aceh, Dr Edi Gunawan, the director of regional public health facility Dr Zubir Mahmud Hospital, told CNA there have been mixed responses among his staff.

“There are those who prefer to believe in hoax ... But I keep guiding them, including how to respond (to hoax),” he said.



The hospital's health workers are scheduled to receive the jabs in February and Dr Gunawan is currently focusing on counselling them and assuring them that they should not be afraid of the vaccine.



In January alone, the West Java provincial government's team of ""hoax busters"" has debunked 51 hoaxes on COVID-19 vaccination.



Among the hoaxes included chips being implanted in the vaccine doses, and claims of the vaccines being non-halal and dangerous.

Senior fact-checker JSH Alfianto Yustinova said hoaxes about COVID-19 vaccination spread quickly because they circulate on social media and messaging apps.

“There’s a video that purportedly showed a student fainting after being injected with COVID-19 vaccine. But that video has actually been around since 2018,” he said.



Mr Sihotang, the health department secretary of Jayapura, said these counterproductive news and hoaxes have affected the public and also health workers.



""Our challenge is not in implementing the vaccination, not from the health side but from the social and cultural side. There has been no risk communication,” he said.

Dr Riono, the epidemiologist, opined that the government’s vaccine communication has been far from ideal.

“We are not just injecting vaccines but we are also injecting knowledge prior to the vaccination. And some are rejecting it, not all … they should be left alone but do not let them spread hoaxes.

“But then there are others who are doubtful. And there are many of these. And this can only be overcome if there is truthful and accurate information,” he said, adding that the efficacy and side effects of the vaccines have not been communicated clearly to the general public.

Dr Riono said the government’s tactic of using a celebrity with many followers but does not have relevant medical knowledge as a role model for vaccination is wrong.

Raffi Ahmad was one of the first people to receive the jab last week along with Mr Widodo at the Jakarta palace. He shared his experience with about 50 million followers on his Instagram, but hours later pictures of him gathering with friends at a party without wearing a mask surfaced and sparked a backlash.

Mr Nugroho, the visiting senior fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, told CNA that policy communication during the pandemic should be open and honest.

“So that the public has the appropriate risk perception. This perception is important so the public knows the risks they are facing.”

At the end of the day, both experts believe vaccination is not a silver bullet.

“Vaccination does not mean that once we are vaccinated we are free from the virus. But vaccination is important to be done together along with other measures such as washing hands, wearing a mask, maintaining a safe distance from one another, testing, tracing and treatment.

“This means that both the community and the government have obligations,” said Mr Nugroho.

As of Thursday (Jan 21), there have been over 900,000 COVID-19 cases in Indonesia.

The mortality burden of climate-related catastrophes such as storms, flooding and heatwaves is overwhelmingly borne by developing countries.

At the start of the Climate Adaptation Summit, held virtually this year due to the pandemic, the think tank Germanwatch calculated that these disasters have cost the global economy a staggering $2.56 trillion this century.

An analysis of more than 11,000 extreme weather events showed nearly 480,000 fatalities since 2000, with Puerto Rico, Myanmar and Haiti the worst hit countries, it said.

Under the 2015 Paris climate deal, wealthier nations are supposed to provide $100 billion every year to help poorer states mitigate temperature rises and adapt to the changing climate.

But recent research suggests the true amount of funding available to developing countries for climate action is vastly lower.

Germanwatch’s Global Climate Index examined the impact of two decades of extreme weather events, particularly the 2019 storm season, which produced hurricanes and cyclones that devastated parts of the Caribbean, east Africa and south Asia.

“This shows that poor vulnerable countries face particularly great challenges in dealing with the consequences of extreme weather events,” said co-author David Eckstein.

“They urgently need financial and technical assistance.”

Funding gap

Adaptation — reducing the fallout among communities and increasing their capacity to deal with climate-related disasters such as floods and drought — is a pillar of the Paris accord.

The deal earmarks $50 billion annually to adaptation, but as disasters have multiplied in the years since it was struck, the United Nations says the cost will balloon over the coming years.

Out of an estimated $70 billion needed by developing nations each year, only $30 billion is currently available.

In its Adaptation Gap report this month, the UN’s Environment Programme said the true annual cost of adapting to climate impacts could be as high as $300 billion by 2030 and $500 billion by mid-century.

Eight out of the top ten most affected countries on Monday’s index have low or lower middle income per capita.

“Poorer countries are hit hardest because they are more vulnerable to the damaging effects of a hazard and have lower coping capacity,” said co-author Vera Keunzel.

She said countries such as Haiti, the Philippines and Pakistan were hit nearly constantly by extreme weather events, leading them no time to fully recover from one disaster before the next strikes.

The Climate Adaptation Summit, hosted by the Netherlands, will see countries convene virtually to seek “clear commitments to deliver concrete new endeavours” to help countries deal with the changing climate.","Mon, 25 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://theglobepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/extremeweather.jpg,"['extreme', 'disasters', 'nations', 'weather', 'killed', 'climate', 'countries', 'deal', 'analysis', 'century', '480000', 'billion', 'events', 'adaptation']",

National Covid-19 Task Force Head Doni Monardo confirmed on Saturday he has tested positive for coronavirus following week-long trips to Sulawesi and Kalimantan.

Doni, who also chairs the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, or BNPB, has spent the past week in West Sulawesi to coordinate responses after a devastating earthquake and in South Kalimantan where massive flooding paralyzed several districts.

“The result from my PCR [polymerase chain reaction]-based test last night came back positive this morning. I didn’t feel any mild symptom as I had my morning routine -- going for an eight-kilometer walk,” Doni said in a statement.

He said he is now self-quarantining at home while continuing to work remotely.

No casualties were reported.

The sounds of the eruption could be heard 30 kilometres away, officials said. It was Mount Merapi's biggest lava flow since authorities raised its danger level in November, said Hanik Humaida, the head of Yogyakarta's Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Center.

She said the volcano's lava dome is growing rapidly, causing hot lava and gas clouds to flow down its slopes.

After morning rain, the ashfall turned into muck in several villages. More than 150 people, mostly elderly, living within 5 kilometres of the crater were evacuated to barracks set up for displaced people.

Authorities in November had evacuated nearly 2,000 people living on the mountain in Magelang and Sleman districts but most have since returned.

The alert is being maintained at the second-highest level and authorities told people to stay out of an existing danger zone around the crater.

The 2,968-metre volcano is on densely populated Java island near the ancient city of Yogyakarta. It is the most active of dozens of Indonesian volcanoes and has repeatedly erupted with lava and gas clouds recently.

Merapi's last major eruption in 2010 killed 347 people.

""Based on the the directives from the BNPB Chief, the emergency response status that will end on January 28 is to be extended for two weeks,"" Rifai, Deputy for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of BNPB, said on Saturday.

The joint search and rescue team has completed the evacuation process, but the emergency status needed to be extended for further handling of refugee problems, including concerning health issue and technical matters, according to him.

""The status has become an emergency response towards recovery,"" Rifai said.

West Sulawesi Governor Ali Baal Masdar declared an emergency response status until January 28, 2021, after a 6.2 shallow earthquake rocked Mamuju and Majene Districts on January 15, 2021.

The natural disaster has displaced 89,624 residents, claimed 93 lives, rendered three people missing, and seriously injured 746 people, moderately injured 240, and slightly injured 2,703 others.

In the meantime, Indonesia had been stricken by a total of 197 natural disasters during the January 1-23 period, according to data of BNPB. Most of those disasters were hydrometeorological disasters, the agency wrote on its official Twitter account on Saturday.

The disasters comprising 134 floods, 31 landslides, and 24 whirlwinds, claimed 184 lives, injured, 2,700 people, rendered nine people missing, and affected or displaced 1.9 million people.

In January 2020, during the same period, BNPB recorded 297 natural disasters that claimed 91 lives across Indonesia.

The activities aimed to assess COVID-19 preparedness in fifteen provinces based on the status of their pandemic risk.

The assessment covered provincial command centres, provincial health offices, port health offices, hospitals, laboratories, district health offices, public health centres, and community health centres.

All assessed provinces had a functioning command and control structure for pandemic management. However, not all of them has established Emergency Operations Centres (EOC). Contingency plans for pandemic response were in place in several locations, but there remains a need for joint contingency plans with neighbouring countries.

Key areas of improvement were case reporting and analysis for pandemic severity, budget allocation for response in points of entry, personal protective equipment stockpiling, and exit screening of passengers. The assessment further identified health system gaps in provinces, such as availability of ICU and other facilities in the event of rising COVID-19 cases.

Laboratories for COVID-19 testing are facing challenges. One of the solutions is to develop a laboratory referral system to avoid specimen accumulations. Meanwhile, the biggest gaps in the surveillance system in all provinces were the low level of isolation of suspected cases and the challenge to confirm COVID-19 status within 48 hours. Contact tracing, contact quarantine and case isolation need to be strengthened.

The results of the field assessment will be used to inform key stakeholders of the strengths and gaps in each province in responding to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, they will be useful in preparing the country for future outbreaks.

WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19. A special appreciation goes to Member States and other contributors who provided flexible funds, making it possible for WHO to deliver a coherent, strategic and broad response.

If we look back on our previous year, which was filled with uncertainty, one of the most notable shifts was the kind of content posted and consumed online. You rarely saw photos of sunny Bali vacations or selfie videos of people watching concerts, unless they were nostalgic posts. Instead, digital platforms were flooded with feeds of people in pajamas, wearing no makeup and mostly at home doing virtual things or trying to stay entertained by posting simply and candidly.

There been a shift in the culture away from inauthenticity on social media – because people have gotten a little tired of that. Especially in 2020, interestingly, people came back to themselves and wanted to share their authenticity. People are looking around, and they're seeing everybody is in the same boat. Seeing more people in similar situations, even virtually, has apparently created a normalizing and calming effect.

The desire for more authentic content is not new. For years, campaigns championing untouched photos of models have gained popularity in advertisements and magazines. As the pandemic has reshaped our lives, we have been exposed to even more unfiltered content, with everyone from celebrities and news anchors to television hosts broadcasting from home.

That authenticity is now extending deeper into social media, as people flock to platforms that embrace posts by anyone, even unknown people out of their circle.

Overall internet consumption has increased during the pandemic, with a surge of 200 million users, as reported by the Association of Internet Service Providers of Indonesia (APJII).More than 50 percent use it for social media and to watch online videos.

The main appeal of TikTok is its focus on humor, with videos ranging from memes and embarrassing moments to videos of surreal visualizations of post-COVID-19 lives. These can be a coping mechanism for the stresses of the pandemic. The look of the creator, or even the quality of the video, is not the top priority. People are more compelled by the content itself, rather than the overall aesthetic.

This is a very important shift. The platform reveals the creativity of raw potential rather than nice backgrounds. Remember the popcorn duet craze? It was entertaining, relatable to many generations and showcased new talent. So much content enables people to be entertained during the crisis by simply using their raw talent.

This has triggered a post-demographic trend in the case of TikTok, where more and more generations have started using the app. When you visit TikTok, you will see millions of users adding to the diversity of content and range of human expression. Being real is the new cultural currency, as today's influence comes from the authentic ideas and imagination of everyday people.

This authenticity has driven brands to change their marketing strategy. TikTok recently conducted a study with Nielsen and found that more than 60 percent of TikTok’s users felt that advertising on TikTok was unique. They found it more authentic, fun, genuine, honest, real and trustworthy than other channels. Brands also engage with the top creators or TikTok users with outstanding views and followers to help their marketing posts become more relatable.

COVID-19 has surely changed the type of content that's being created. We crave connection online because the real-life kind has largely been taken away from us. Authentic creativity is at an all-time high. People and brands are so starving for human interaction that the content we're seeing now is a little more honest, direct and, most importantly, more personal and human.

59,59,FL-2021-000005-IDN,The next Philippines natural disaster is coming - Nikkei Asia,https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/The-next-Philippines-natural-disaster-is-coming2,"Robert Kaufman heads the Philippines country office for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

Imagine getting hit by six typhoons during a deadly pandemic. For millions of people in the Philippines, this was their reality as 2020 came crashing to a close. Predictions of the increasing severity and frequency of emergencies have come true.

It is heartbreaking, exhausting and scary. But most of all it is frustrating as much of this human and economic toll can be prevented.

We have known about the brutal effects of climate change for a long time, yet we have not been doing enough to fix it. Debates about the effects of climate change or whether partners should support more preparedness are failing people. If your roof blows off three times in one month and this extreme weather happens with relentless certainty, there is nothing to debate. It is time to prepare more for what is coming.

We know that the Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, topping the charts with the most disasters of all countries the past two years. It is number two for the past decade just behind China.

We know the number of climate-related disasters has risen almost 35% since the 1990s. The stuff of Hollywood movies has become a reality for tens of millions of people around the world, as they face bigger, more violent storms and more disease outbreaks.

For decades we anticipated another pandemic. Hollywood blockbusters told horror stories of contagious diseases. Since 2008, we have seen fantasy become reality with several pandemics, the H1N1 flu virus, SARS and now COVID-19. Yet somehow, the world has been taken by surprise.

Let's make no mistake, we have made inroads. Governments, humanitarian agencies and countless communities deserve credit for helping to save lives. Just seven years ago, the most destructive typhoon to hit the Philippines on record, Haiyan, killed close to 7,000 people. When Typhoon Goni hit in 2020, a storm as strong as Haiyan, less than 70 lives were lost. Still, I am frustrated.

Early on in management, I learned that when you spend significant time and money on something, it is a priority. Most of the time and money in the aid sector is still spent on response, as if we do not know what is coming; neither the humanitarian community, the policymakers, nor the big donors.

Why are we not using our extraordinary capacity to anticipate crises to prioritize our time and money? What price do we need to place on the lives of people who have died or had their livelihoods ripped apart by disease and disaster before we change our priorities?

Today, we largely know the types of risks we are going to face, where they are going to hit and even in many cases, when. Many of the answers are as clear as day. Typhoons strike the Philippines every November and December. Floods always follow drought in East Africa.

We know the risks and we know what to do about it. The latest study on the value of preparedness confirms what we already knew. Every dollar invested in reducing risks from climate-related disasters saves us $6 when we are fixing up the mess, according to the United States Institute of Building Sciences and the United Nations.

Super Typhoon Goni packed the most powerful winds of any storm in the world last year. Together with Typhoon Vamco and other major storms, they came at a huge cost, seriously affecting the lives of more than 8.1 million people. More than 425,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed.

Among the millions whose livelihoods were disrupted, at least 200,000 farmers and fishermen lost their only source of income. The cost of agricultural damages totaled more than 12.3 billion pesos ($256 million) according to the Philippines Department of Agriculture.

Together, the storms were considered the second most expensive typhoons on record, costing more than $1 billion. Money normally reserved for responding after disasters strike needs to be made available earlier and for longer-term solutions.

We need to stop soil erosion, plant trees and improve drainage. We need to avoid crop wastage with better grain storage and irrigation. We need to build safer houses with stronger and more permanent foundations. We need to protect land rights and strengthen economic development and social protection programs so that people are not dependent on aid when disaster strikes.

There needs to be a public accounting of how well resource allocation aligns with scientific prediction and the lessons we have learned. We must put our money where our mouth is. Failing is a dereliction of our responsibility to those most at risk and to ourselves.

This past year, millions have faced often insurmountable hardships and heartache. We have a duty to protect the hope and dignity of those we pledge to support by ensuring everyone has a fair chance of a decent life. There just cannot be any more excuses.","Sat, 23 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F9%252F3%252F0%252F4%252F31914039-3-eng-GB%252FCropped-1611228104R20210121%2520Typhoon%2520Vamco%2520Rodriguez.JPG?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['disasters', 'need', 'millions', 'natural', 'know', 'coming', 'typhoon', 'lives', 'money', 'world', 'hit', 'philippines', 'disaster']",

This story was originally published by WIRED and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

As California’s Economy skyrocketed during the 20th century, its land headed in the opposite direction. A booming agricultural industry in the state’s San Joaquin Valley, combined with punishing droughts, led to the over-extraction of water from aquifers. Like huge, empty water bottles, the aquifers crumpled, a phenomenon geologists call subsidence. By 1970, the land had sunk as much as 28 feet in the valley, with less-than-ideal consequences for the humans and infrastructure above the aquifers.

The San Joaquin Valley was geologically primed for collapse, but its plight is not unique. All over the world—from the Netherlands to Indonesia to Mexico City—geology is conspiring with climate change to sink the ground under humanity’s feet. More punishing droughts mean the increased draining of aquifers, and rising seas make sinking land all the more vulnerable to flooding. According to a recent study published in the journal Science, in the next two decades, 1.6 billion people could be affected by subsidence, with potential loses in the trillions of dollars.

“Subsidence has been neglected in a lot of ways because it is slow moving. You don’t recognize it until you start seeing damage,” says Michelle Sneed, a land subsidence specialist at the U.S. Geological Survey and coauthor on the paper. “The land sinking itself is not a problem. But if you’re on the coast, it’s a big problem. If you have infrastructure that crosses long areas, it’s a big problem. If you have deep wells, they’re collapsing because of subsidence. That’s a problem.”

The situation in Indonesia is so dire that officials plan to relocate the nation’s capital.

For subsidence to become a problem, you need two things: The right kind of land, and an over-exploited aquifer. Aquifers hold water in between bits of sand, gravel, or clay. When the amount of clay in an aquifer is particularly high, the grains arrange themselves like plates thrown haphazardly in a sink—they’ve basically got random orientations, and the water fills in the spaces between the grains. But if you start extracting water from an aquifer, those spaces collapse and the grains draw closer together. “Those plates rearrange themselves into more like a stack of dinner plates that you put in your cupboard,” says Sneed. “It takes a lot less space, obviously, to stack the plates that way. And so that’s the compaction of the aquifer system that then results in land subsidence at the surface.”

But wouldn’t pumping more water back into the aquifer force the clay plates back to their random, spacey orientations? Unfortunately, no. “It’ll press those grains apart a little bit—you’ll get a little bit of expansion in the aquifer system represented as uplift on the land surface. But it’s a tiny amount,” says Sneed. We’re talking maybe three quarters of an inch of movement. “They’re still stacked like the plates in your cupboard,” she continues.

So at this point you’ve got a double-barreled problem: The land has sunk and it won’t reinflate, and the aquifers won’t hold as much water as they once did, because they’ve compressed. “And that’s an important point,” says Sneed. “As places around the world, including California, are starting to use aquifer systems as managed reservoirs, the compaction of them prior to now has reduced their ability to store water.”

As the growing human population and more intense droughts brought on by climate change are putting ever more stress on water supplies, land is subsiding all over the world. Some parts of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, for instance, are sinking as much as 10 inches a year, all while the seas are rising around it. Models estimate that in just three decades, 95 percent of North Jakarta could be underwater. The situation is so dire, Indonesia is planning to move its capital. But scientists haven’t modeled global risks of subsidence—until now. To build their model, Sneed and her colleagues scoured the existing literature on land subsidence in 200 locations worldwide. They considered those geological factors (high clay content), as well as topology, as subsidence is more likely to happen on flat land. They factored in population and economic growth, data on water use, and climate variables. The researchers found that, planet-wide, subsidence could threaten 4.6 million square miles of land in the next two decades. While that’s just 8 percent of Earth’s land, humanity tends to build big cities in coastal areas, which are prone to subsidence. So they estimate that, in the end, 1.6 billion people could be affected. The modeling further found that worldwide, subsidence exposes assets totaling a gross domestic product of $8.19 trillion, or 12 percent of global GDP. True, gradual subsidence isn’t as destructive as a sudden earthquake or volcanic eruption. “But it will cause these indirect effects or impacts that, in the long term, can produce either damages to structures or infrastructure, or increase floodable areas in these river basins or coastal areas,” says geoscientist Gerardo Herrera-García of the Geological and Mining Institute of Spain, lead author on the paper.

Subsidence is uniquely sensitive to climate change—at least indirectly. On a warmer planet, droughts are longer and more intense. “This is very important,” says Herrera-García. “Because no matter the amount of annual rainfall you have, the most important issue is that you have a prolonged drought period.” Dry reservoirs will lead cities to pump even more water out of their aquifers, and once you collapse the structure of an aquifer by neatly stacking those plates of clay grains, there’s no going back. For the 1.6 billion people potentially affected by subsidence—and that’s just by the year 2040—the consequences could be dire, leading to both water shortages and the flooding of low-lying land.

“It’s definitely very startling results,” says USGS coastal geologist Patrick Barnard, who studies subsidence but wasn’t involved in this new work. “Especially coastal megacities—most of the megacities are, in fact, coastal. So it really highlights the issue in relation to coastal flooding.” And urban populations are booming: According to the United Nations, nearly 70 percent of humans will live in cities by 2050, up from 50 percent currently.

Humanity has tended to construct its cities where rivers empty into the sea, where the conditions for subsidence are ideal. Long ago, these rivers deposited sediments loaded with the clay, which humans then built upon. “The areas that are at high risk are in those kinds of settings near the outlets of river deltas, and where you have low-lying, flat sedimentary basins near coasts,” says University of California, Berkeley geophysicist Roland Burgmann, who studies subsidence but wasn’t involved in this new work. But you can actually find this problem inland, too, for instance in Mexico City, which is built on top of the sediments of a former lake, and is accordingly suffering from subsidence.

Cities built on landfill are also sinking as that material settles. In the Bay Area megalopolis, for instance, some areas are sinking as much as a third of an inch a year. Modeling estimates from researchers at Arizona State University and UC Berkeley hold that by the end of the century, as much as 165 square miles of the Bay Area could be inundated as land sinks and the sea rises.

Subsidence gets even trickier because its effects can vary dramatically over short distances, depending on factors like local clay composition or which side of an earthquake fault the land happens to be on. So this new global study is great for determining risk on a large scale, but scientists will still have to investigate subsidence with a finer focus.","Sat, 23 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20210122_San-Joaquin-Valley-aerial.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['aquifer', 'california', 'aquifers', 'jakarta', 'problem', 'water', 'areas', 'coastal', 'plates', 'delta', 'land', 'clay', 'collapsing', 'worlds', 'subsidence']", 
62,62,FL-2021-000005-IDN,AmResearch sees minimal impact from floods on Sime Darby Plantation's operations - The Edge Markets MY,https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/amresearch-sees-minimal-impact-floods-sime-darby-plantations-operations,"KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 19): AmInvestment Bank Research (AmResearch) has maintained its “hold” rating of Sime Darby Plantation Bhd, with an unchanged fair value (FV) of RM5.55, as it expects the company to see minimal impact from the floods in Malaysia.

“We understand that the wet weather has only affected Sime Darby Plantation’s operations in Malaysia so far. Less than 10,000ha of Sime Darby Plantation’s oil palm estates in Malaysia were hit by the floods. These comprise only 3.3% of Sime Darby Plantation’s planted areas of 300,000ha in Malaysia,” said AmResearch in a note today.

Meanwhile, it added that the company’s oil palm estates in Kalimantan were not affected as they already experienced heavy rains in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2020 (3QFY20).

It also said the impact on PNG (Papua New Guinea) was not known yet as the wet season usually takes place only from February onwards.

About 51.3% of Sime Darby Plantation’s planted areas of oil palms were located in Malaysia as of the end of FY19, while another 33.2% were in Indonesia. The balance 15.5% of the company’s planted areas were in PNG/Solomon Islands.

Operationally, the research house now assumes the company’s fresh fruits bunch (FFB) production to grow 4% in FY21, underpinned by its Indonesian division. It anticipates the Indonesian unit to record an FFB output growth of 5% in FY21 after registering a 10% fall in FY20.

“On a group level, we believe that Sime Darby Plantation will achieve an average FFB yield of 20 tonnes/ha in FY21 versus 19.5 tonnes/ha in FY20,” said the research house.

The research house kept its earnings forecast for FY21 unchanged at RM955.8 million for Sime Darby Plantation.

However, it raised its FY20 net profit forecast by 5.9% to RM789.3 million, accounting for a higher plantation earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margin and downstream earnings.

In line with the higher net profit, the research house forecast the company’s dividend per share (DPS) to increase to eight sen for FY20 and further grow to 8.5 sen for FY21, compared with one sen for FY19.

Meanwhile, it forecast the company’s net gearing (including RM2.2 billion perpetual sukuk) to decline to 67.2% as at end-FY20, from 72% as at end-FY19, due to higher cash flows from improved crude palm oil (CPO) prices.

Going forward, the research house believes that the company’s de-gearing exercise will take a breather in FY21.

“Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we reckon that there is little appetite for land bank acquisition currently. Also, approvals of government agencies for any potential sale of land bank may take some time,” it pointed out.

“As at end-June 2020, Sime Darby Plantation had sold about 58.1% or 1,350 acres out of the 2,324 acres of land bank targeted for disposal. We think that Sime Darby Plantation recognised gains of RM450 million from the disposal of land bank and non-performing assets in 9MFY20 (the cumulative first nine months ended Sept 30, 2020),” it added.

It noted that Sime Darby Plantation’s asset disposal programme involves selling 2,324 acres of land bank and its 50% stake in Emery Oleochemicals for a rough sum of more than RM1.5 billion in total.

At noon, the stock was traded 12 sen or 2.41% higher at RM5.10, bringing it a market value of RM35.1 billion. The stock had rebounded 27% from its March’s low of RM4.01.","Tue, 19 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/Sime-Darby-Plantation_www.simedarbyplantation.com__24.jpg?R2UTrwJ9I8snwWjkzejcwtiNrHndSOJh,"['sime', 'operations', 'bank', 'sees', 'amresearch', 'minimal', 'floods', 'research', 'sen', 'impact', 'companys', 'land', 'fy21', 'darby', 'plantation', 'plantations']",

Nearly 10,000 people have been displaced in West Sulawesi, with over 1,150 houses destroyed as well as three hospitals. Mercy Corps is providing clean water, hygiene kits, shelter and food to local residents.



Piva Bell, Mercy Corps’ Indonesia Response Team Manager, says:

“Nearly 10,000 people have been forced from their homes by this earthquake, with many left in crowded makeshift evacuation shelters without access to basic sanitary and food supplies, or even clean water.

“Cases of COVID‑19 are rising in the Mamuju and Majene regencies, and both affected districts are Red Zones -- Indonesia’s highest COVID‑19 risk rating -- but hygiene supplies such as masks, hand sanitizer and facilities such as hand washing stations are not available in displacement shelters. Hospitals have been destroyed and the heavy rainfall has made it extremely difficult to reach those most affected because it caused landslides in several spots, blocking access to remote areas.

“Mercy Corps Indonesia’s emergency responders have themselves encountered heavy rain, landslides and power outages, as they work to reach the affected areas and the communications lines and internet are unstable. People have now gone days without the basic supplies they need to survive.

“We’re rushing support to the people of West Sulawesi as quickly as possible. The sheer number of disasters that this part of Indonesia has endured in recent weeks has reduced everyone’s ability to cope.”

Mercy Corps has worked in Indonesia for over 20 years. Our Indonesian Response Team was established in 2007 and has responded to over 20 disasters, including earthquakes, floods, landslides and tsunamis.

Jakarta (AsiaNews) – The number of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia topped one million today. On Saturday, the positivity rate was 33.2 per cent. One in three tested Indonesians is infected, far above the 5 per cent limit set by the World Health Organization.

The numbers, the highest in Southeast Asia, do not tell the whole truth about the pandemic in Indonesia. Testing and contact tracing capacity remains very low.

“Most people who were tested are like me,” Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said Friday, referring to people who were tested voluntarily.

So far, 1,012,350 cases have been reported with 163,000 people hospitalised or in self-isolation, including Doni Monardo, head of the national COVID-19 task force. More than 28,000 people have died with about 820,500 healed.

According to epidemiologists, the dead could be at least three times the official figure. Almost all cities and regencies (districts) have reported a shortage of hospital beds, intensive care units, ventilators, oxygen tanks, isolation centres, and burial sites.

On 19 January, a mother and her three-year-old child found a place in the capital's Cipto Mangunkusumo hospital. They succeeded only after volunteers contacted 60 health facilities, but without access to intensive care. Several sick people reported being treated in corridors and waiting rooms of hospitals.

“Families who have decided to bring home their sick relatives are physically and mentally exhausted,” said Irma Hidayana of LaporCOVID-19, a civic group that helps medical staff fight the pandemic.

During an online press conference yesterday, she explained that many families have been “traumatised” by the repeated refusals by hospitals. A number of sick people, especially the elderly, have died while their families were moving them from one facility to another.

Local governments are adding as many hospitalisation and isolation centres as possible, but medical staff are severely stretched.

Since the outbreak of the pandemic in March, 652 healthcare workers have died, including doctors, nurses, midwives and lab technicians. According to LaporCOVID-19, the highest number of victims was registered in community health centres, the lowest level of health facilities.

For the authorities, the vaccination of about 1.3 million healthcare professionals remains the priority. However, the campaign is proceeding slowly.

After the holidays at the end of the year, infections took off: 103 doctors and members of the medical staff died in January.

In various parts of the country, volunteers and healthcare workers are struggling to enforce anti-COVID protocols, such as among flood survivors in the provinces of North Sulawesi and South Kalimantan. The same goes for the nearly 20,000 residents of West Sulawesi who need shelter after a recent earthquake that killed 90 people and aftershocks.

The West Sulawesi Health Agency reported widespread resistance among refugees to coronavirus testing.

Thamrin, one of nearly 700 earthquake survivors who fled to Makassar, capital of southern Sulawesi, said in a video on fajar.co.id media website that the tests would aggravate the mental “trauma” of earthquake survivors.

Makassar Mayor Rudy Djamaluddin welcomed all the refugees and encouraged them to undergo free testing to contain the pandemic. Local authorities expect aftershocks in the next three weeks; all rescuers and volunteers are also being tested.","Tue, 26 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/INDONESIA_-_0126_-_Covid.jpg,"['sulawesi', 'staff', 'sick', 'cases', 'covid19', 'pandemic', 'reported', 'million', 'indonesia', 'tested', 'health', 'volunteers', 'died', 'workers']",

Up to yesterday, some 691 people from 203 families in 223 villages were seeking temporary shelter at 15 relief centres.

While floodwaters in some areas started to recede, other parts were bracing for another round of floods as heavy rain was expected to lash down today.

Landslips along the main roads on the Crocker Range that links the state capital with interior Sabah have damaged several stretches.

As of late Sunday, Sabah Disaster Management Committee said 26 roads were affected, including 10 stretches which were damaged by landslips.

Penampang was the worst hit while some sections of roads in northern Kudat, Pitas, Tuaran and Kota Belud were damaged.

Landslips and cave-ins also occurred along roads in Kota Kinabalu, Kota Marudu, Pitas and Kudat.

The Civil Defence Force said they were monitoring closely the ground situation as the weather condition was unpredictable.

At around 9am yesterday, firemen responded to a distress call involving a car parked at an eco-farm in Signal Hill which tumbled 30m down a ravine after a landslip there.

No casualties were reported.

Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor, who visited some of the flood-hit areas in his Sulaman constituency in Tuaran, as well as Penampang, have called on the people to heed instructions to evacuate if the need arises.

Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Seri Bung Moktar Radin also urged motorists to be cautious on the roads due to the floods and road cave-ins.

He said the Public Works Department (JKR) and the respective road maintenance concessionaires have been directed to take necessary steps to put warning signs along affected roads including Penampang-Tambunan road that saw a major cave-in.

The authorities also carried out urgent inspections on the Luyang flyover where a side barrier was dislocated, raising safety concerns.

State JKR director Ali Ahmad Hamid said an investigation was underway and safety measures have already been put in place.

For worst-hit Penampang, some residents have started to clean up their homes after facing two waves of floods.

Kapayan assemblyman Jannie Lasimbang said many areas including Kg Peringatan, Kobusak, Tunoh and Hungab, as well as housing areas in Taman Sahabat, Regency Park and Millenium Heights in Bundusan were badly flooded.

“There were also areas in Kg Koidupan hit by landslides as well as many roads left flooded and impassable, ” she said.

Some residents blamed the much-delayed flood mitigation programme for Penampang and clogged drains as among the key reasons for the district to be constantly hit by floods during heavy rains.","Tue, 19 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2021/01/19/1012829.jpg,"['alert', 'roads', 'road', 'penampang', 'including', 'sabah', 'areas', 'floods', 'heavy', 'kota', 'flash', 'hit', 'high']",

Amman – In a notable example of cross-regional collaboration, UN-Habitat kicked-off the implementation of the participatory City Resilience Action Planning tool (CityRAP), in its ‘light’ version in Amman, Jordan.

The tool has been modified to specifically address the issue of flashfloods in downtown Amman and was delivered through a hybrid virtual and in-person modality in compliance with COVID-19 rules for gatherings and social distancing.

The workshop, led by UN-Habitat Jordan Office and supported by UN-Habitat Regional Office for Africa (ROAF), included interactive sessions to introduce participants to the concepts of urban resilience and disaster risk management, discuss the issues and challenges in the city, and suggest potential solutions.

With over 40 attendees, the workshop saw participation from relevant departments at Greater Amman Municipality, youth, women, persons with disabilities, Municipal Council of Children, Syrian refugees and local community representatives.

CityRAP is a participatory planning process that uses a sequence of highly interactive workshops, exercises and activities to enable urban communities and stakeholders to determine their area’s most pressing resilience building needs through a fully inclusive effort. CityRAP was developed by the Regional Office for Africa together with the Technical Centre for Disaster Risk Management, Sustainability and Urban Resilience (DiMSUR).

Since 2016, CityRAP has been implemented in 30+ locations in 11 countries across Southern Africa. This is the first time CityRAP is being taken out of Africa and implemented in another region. This experience will be a test of the tool’s flexibility to adapt to different geographic, cultural and socioeconomic contexts, and can open up opportunities for further applications around the world.

This collaboration and CityRAP implementation comes as part of the project 'Strengthening the social stability and resilience of vulnerable Jordanian communities and Syrian refugees in Amman against flash floods', funded by the Japan Supplementary Fund (JSP) and implemented by UN-Habitat’s Regional Office for the Arab States. The project aims to improve urban resilience status in Amman, by strengthening the capacities of the government and community dwellers, to reduce the vulnerabilities of refugees and manage flood disasters better.","Tue, 19 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",,"['unhabitat', 'protect', 'regional', 'office', 'communities', 'jordan', 'vulnerable', 'flashfloods', 'amman', 'urban', 'africa', 'cityrap', 'implemented', 'mitigate', 'strengthening', 'refugees', 'resilience']",

The town of Bewdley, in Worcestershire, saw its flood defence barriers breached after heavy rain caused the River Severn to overflow, sending deep, muddy waters gushing into streets and homes.

In response, firefighters deployed boats to rescue those who were trapped by the flooding, according to British broadcaster Sky News.

One resident, Dan Madden, broke down in tears as he called upon Prime Minister Boris Johnson to install a permanent flood barrier, which could stop such an incident happening again.

Mark Demayo, ABS-CBN News

MANILA (UPDATE) - The state-run Philippine National Railways (PNR) and the Department of Transportation unveiled one of three newly-purchased train sets from Indonesia, which will augment the PNR's fleet.

A total of 3 diesel hydraulic locomotives (DHLs) and 15 passenger coaches were delivered by Indonesia's PT. Industri Kereta Api or “PT INKA”, said PNR Assistant GM Ces Lauta during the event.

One train set can handle up to 1,330 passengers, which is the highest capacity for PNR, she added.

PT INK delivered its first batch of trains for the PNR in December 2019.

The existing operational train sets were donations or second-hand units from South Korea and Japan.

PNR General Manager Junn Magno said the additional trains will double the capacity of PNR Metro Commuter Line to 140,000 passengers daily from the current 48,000 to 60,000 commuters per day.

Magno said they made sure that the trains have a high clearance to withstand floods.

“Meron siyang system na kapag bumaha walang masisira. Pwede siya bumaha kahit 18 inches yung tubig. Historically hanggang 5 inches yung baha dito sa atin, so kayang-kaya niya tapusin ang baha.” Magno said.

(It has a system that's not affected by floods. it can handle floods as deep as 18 inches. Historically, floods here are only 5 inches, so it can easily handle floods.)

The middle coaches will serve as a control room for door operations, lightings, public announcements and CCTV camera monitoring.

PNR said the trains have 2 driver cabins placed at both ends, and are equipped with a new airconditioning system suitable for tropical countries like the Philippines.

The trains have interior access to the engine room, the first of its kind for the PNR fleet, the state-run railway operator added.

Magno said PNR will not hike rates and will continue to offer the lowest fare among at-grade vehicles from Tutuban Station in Manila to Los Baños in Laguna.

Once the fermentation reaches the desired level, the yoghurt is pumped through a cooler, before any fruit is added or flavouring stirred in.

In Singapore, there are two products available, in plain (no added sugar) and original (sweetened) flavours.

Jasmine Lim, regional marketing manager for dairy at Greenfields Dairy told FoodNavigator-Asia​ that the firm saw an opportunity to introduce high quality yoghurt into the region. Japfa is the parent company of Greenfields.

“We are a dairy company with more than 20 years of experience in dairy farming, and producing milk, whipping cream and cheeses. We want to launch more quality dairy products, so after studying the market, we see opportunities in enter the yoghurt category.​”

Instead of fresh milk, some yoghurt manufacturers use milk solids which requires the addition of water. This in turns lowers the quality of the product.

Stir it up​

Greenfields stirred yoghurts are made from fresh milk sourced from its own farm, and contain fibre and live bacteria cultures, lactobacillus bulgaricus​ and streptococcus thermophilus​ to maintain good gut health.

Greenfields is an integrated dairy business, operating two farms in East Java, Indonesia, with some 18,000 cows. Its manufacturing facility is also located in East Java. The company controls the feed, processing, manufacturing and packaging, ensuring full traceability of its dairy products.

It currently exports milk and dairy products to Singapore, Hong Kong, Brunei, Malaysia and Myanmar.

According to Lim, the company is seeing potential to introduce its stirred yoghurts into Malaysia, Hong Kong, and other South East Asian countries.

Markets ​

Available in 500g and 1kg sizes, the stirred yoghurt products are retailing at online grocery site Redmart, and selected supermarket chains FairPrice and Cold Storage in Singapore.

Lim said the plain and original variants catered to both consumers and the food service business.

In Indonesia, the stirred yoghurt range also include flavoured variants such as strawberry, blueberry and mango.

The company has also recently launched drinking yoghurts. “We launched into the kids’ yoghurt product category in Indonesia with Greenfields Kids RTD Yoghurt in 150mL bottle in November 2020 and Greenfields Kids Stirred Yoghurt in 80g squeezable pouch in January 2021​.”

Partnerships​

Parent company Japfa is involved in the business of animal proteins, ranging from poultry, beef to pork, aquaculture and dairy products.

Headquartered in Singapore, it operates farming, processing and distribution facilities in Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, India and China.

Japfa is set to sell 80% of its dairy business​ to global investment firm TPG and private equity investor Northstar Group, while holding onto 20% of Greenfields Dairy Singapore, which is the holding company of Japfa’s Greenfields dairy business.

The transaction is expected to be completed by February 2021.

In a statement, Japfa’s CEO Tan Yong Nang said: ""The group's dairy business has grown considerably in recent years both in China and South-east Asia and there is potential for further growth​,

This strategic partnership with TPG and Northstar (will help) accelerate the next phase of development in South-east Asia through their strong track record of developing consumer and retail businesses.""​","Mon, 25 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-asia.com/headlines/business/stirring-up-the-market-indonesia-s-greenfields-expanding-stirred-yoghurt-range-in-sea/12104536-2-eng-GB/Stirring-up-the-market-Indonesia-s-Greenfields-expanding-stirred-yoghurt-range-in-SEA.jpg,"['stirring', 'company', 'milk', 'stirred', 'greenfields', 'sea', 'singapore', 'business', 'range', 'expanding', 'indonesia', 'yoghurt', 'dairy', 'products', 'indonesias', 'market']",

the fragmented façade allows residents to enjoy maximum garden exposure without compromising their privacy

RAD+ar‘s basic concept was to reduce the internal microclimate by 4°C while maintaining natural light and ventilation throughout the house. the first step in this passive design can be seen on the elevational treatment. the façades are designed to minimize direct sunlight and maximize privacy. however, views from inside are still ensured by controlling the angle of the openings.

floating concrete walls meet air pressure from the swimming pool

the secondary façade acts as the first layer against solar radiation. a buffer space between the concrete panels and large glass openings prevents heat from entering the habitable rooms. as well as function, the concrete panels also serve as a blank canvas for shadowplay from the surrounding vegetation, resulting in an ever-changing façade experience.

view of the double-height buffer space

the buffer space between the concrete panels and glass also acts as a transition area between public and private. residents can enjoy balconies and swimming pools that are contained within these parts of the building. this design strategy provides welcome shade and panoramic vantage points to the lush garden, all the while remaining cleverly concealed from the outside.

the main circulation also acts as a wind chimney

a green roof is applied to reduce heat gain and to maximize rainwater harvesting, which is recycled for irrigation. the roof is also integrated with a series of skylights to ensure that no artificial light is required during the daytime.

residents enter the house via a ramp

a ramp is designed at the entrance of the house, which also serves as a personal gallery for the owner. the ramp leads to an informal living area that opens up directly to the swimming pool and frames a view of the garden. the living room also acts as a space barrier between the privacy of two main bedrooms. breaking with traditional residential layouts, the placement of the living room benefits from two sources of natural light and the sense of sanctuary that is created by the adjacent garden.

thanks to the skylights, the circulation space doesn’t need artificial lighting during the day

‘passive design lab was meant to be a simple prototype of how one could apply a down to earth passive design approach in order to achieve comfort without relying much on artificial/active design for sustainability. in the ongoing unplanned urbanization, urban houses are gradually suffocating, isolating, and cutting off themselves from friendly relationships with the surrounding environment, RAD+ar introduced a solution to help awaken to the facing problem, thereby creating a haven within for majority to stay in a safe place while embracing biophilic and tropical approach with the contemporary house, from the perspective of living harmoniously with the environment.’ – RAD+ar

A new collaborative study led by researchers at the National Institute for Environmental Studies, the University of Tokyo, and Michigan State University exposes the role of dams for mitigating flood risk under climate change.

Flood is amongst the costliest natural disasters. Globally, flood risk is projected to increase in the future, driven by climate change and population growth. The role of dams in flood mitigation, previously unaccounted for, was found to decrease by approximately 15% the number of people globally exposed to historical once-in-100-year floods, downstream of dams during the 21st century.

Currently, about half of major river systems worldwide are regulated by dams and more than 3,700 major dams are planned or under construction. Consequently, to realistically assess population exposure to present and future floods, current and future dam landscapes must be integrated into existing flood modeling frameworks.

Accounting for dams in river flood simulations, the number of people exposed to the historical once-in-100-year flood below dams were 7.2 and 13.4 million on average over 2006-2099 given a low and a medium-high greenhouse gas emission trajectory (RCP2.6 and RCP6.0, respectively). The populations exposed to flooding below dams decreased on average by 16.3% and 12.8% for the two trajectories compared to simulations not accounting for the flow regulations produced by dams. At the end of the 21st century, the decrease was further extended to 20.6% and 12.9% respectively.

To maintain the levels of flood protection that dams have provided, new dam operations will be required to offset the effect of climate change, possibly negatively affecting energy production and water storage. In addition, precise and reliable hydro-meteorological forecasts will be invaluable for enhancing flood protection and avoid excessive outflows. Given the many negative environmental and social impacts of dams, comprehensive assessments that consider both potential benefits and adverse effects are necessary for the sustainable development of water resources.

President Joko Widodo visited the command center at Jakarta’s international container terminal where tons of plane debris hauled by divers from seafloor were collected for an investigation into what caused the Boeing 737-500 to nosedive into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta on Jan. 9.

He also witnessed the first three relatives of the victims receiving money from the compensation fund.

Sriwijaya Air offered relatives an insurance payout of 1.25 billion rupiah ($89,100), in line with the Indonesian law that stipulates compensation must be offered within 60 days of a crash. In addition, state-owned insurance company Jasa Raharja has provided 50 million rupiah ($3,560) to each family of the victims.

“I assure you that all compensation will be completed immediately for all victims,” Widodo said.

A search is still ongoing for the crucial memory unit of the cockpit voice recorder.

The device apparently broke loose from its exterior and officials have said the underwater locator beacons attached to both crash-proof black boxes became dislodged due to the impact.

The flight data recorded was recovered three days after the crash.

The 26-year-old Boeing had been out of service for almost nine months last year because of flight cutbacks caused by the pandemic.

As floods yet again devastate Shrewsbury, Craig Jackson has urged the public to be vigilant and not to cause avoidable incidents.

Teams at Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service have been working through the day and night to rescue people stranded in cars across the county after they drove into flood water.

The impact of the floods has put more strain on the fire service as new Covid-19 regulations require firefighters to self-isolate for 10 days if they come into contact with some who test positive – this could mean a whole team off at once.

Mr Jackson said that people should be vigilant and not to drive through flood water or even walk through it as there so many dangers.

""One of the main things at the moment is the impact of incidents that are avoidable,"" he said. ""We appreciate there are incidents that are accidental. But people driving into flood water is an incident that can be avoided.

""The general public have to help us. We are in a challenging situation, trying to maintain our availability and remain Covid-safe. The pandemic is having a huge impact on our staffing.

""When an appliance is out on a job, if one person in that appliance tests positive, the whole team has to self-isolate for 10 days. This puts a massive strain on us. The public have to remain vigilant.""

Overnight on Thursday, water rescue crews were active in the Oswestry area rescuing people from vehicles, said Mr Jackson.

""The night before we had lots of incidents where cars had come to rise in water and crews had to rescue them using our boat,"" he said.

""Our main advice is to look at the Government website, and the Environment Agency which provide really good information about flooding. Definitely don't drive into flood water, don't ignore road closure signs.

""As little as 30cm of water can raise a car and start to float away. A lot of the rescues we do are vans and 4x4s as they think they can make it through because they're taller but unfortunately they get stuck too.

""Don't walk through flood water as some people like to have a paddle in their wellies but don't do it. Drain covers can be lifted and so people can get trapped in drains that they can't see. When the water level is also rising, this can be a very dangerous situation.""

Mr Jackson said that everyone at Shropshire Fire and Rescue has put in a lot of work over the past few months.

""I would say a massive thank you to our crews and the teams at fire control. We have had less amount of firefighters through isolation periods. So we have had crews coming in on their rest days to maintain fire cover for the region.","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.shropshirestar.com/resizer/nNQIVVB1jpukVBmMn_W8F01u2ak=/1200x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/mna/DEOWB4WJ4NF6POQYLWOFI3OZQI.jpg,"['public', 'jackson', 'water', 'service', 'floods', 'dont', 'crews', 'plea', 'extra', 'rescue', 'strain', 'avoid', 'impact', 'incidents', 'flood', 'covid', 'stretched']",

The international NGO has always been at the service when required.

The UK-based humanitarian relief charity has been providing support around the world to victims of natural and man-made disasters such as floods, earthquakes, famine and war. The selfless work they have done for over 20 years hasn't gone unnoticed as they were recently nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Despite winning many accolades through the years, this nomination comes as the best news for the charity working tirelessly to make world a better place, for everyone.

While nominating Khalsa Aid for the prestigious award, Canada's House of Commons in a letter addressed to Berit Reiss-Andersen, the Norwegian Nobel Committee chairperson, mentioned how the organisation has been able to provide crucial aid to millions of people around the world.

Based on the Sikh principle of ""Sarbat Da Bhalla"" meaning well-being for all, the charity has been helping all those in need regardless of race, religion and borders since a period of last 20 years.



While celebrating the work of Khalsa Aid, let us look at the work they are doing across the globe and how they are making meaningful contribution in tackling the humanitarian crisis.

1. Feeding Syrian refugees

Khalsa Aid has a team working resolutely in war-ravaged areas of the middle-east offering aid to the victims of the never ceasing conflict. The organisation's volunteers have been responding to similar crises across the world.

Khalsa Aid

While the world might have turned away from the catastrophe that is the civil war in Syria, Khalsa Aid has been on ground, providing relief to the people who have had to flee their homes.



From free food to shelter to health services, the organisation has been serving and rescuing people in war-torn Syria with dedication.



The organization has said their activity among the Syrian refugees span across Syria, Greece and Lebanon where most of the war displaced are currently living. Their current activities include providing tonnes of food and shoes for hundreds of refugee children in Turkey.

Khalsa Aid’s industrial bakery set up on the Iraq-Syria border in 2014 continues to provide 16,000 loaves of bread each day to as many Yazidi refugees in camps.



2. Providing food and shelter to victims of Kerala floods

When Kerala was devastated by floods in 2018, Khalsa Aid shouldered responsibility and helped feed thousands of victims and also provided them with shelter.

Khalsa Aid volunteers set up relief camps across the state. They set up langars (free community kitchens) and fed 15,000 people with hot meals every day. The group also distributed essential day packs, including soap, toothpaste, toothbrush, sanitary towels, medical kits and mosquito nets.

Khalsa Aid

The volunteers also assisted in packing and distribution of food packets including rice, dal, tea, salt and sugar. Khalsa Aid volunteers also cleaned churches and temples which were filled with sludge from floodwaters.



The packing of nearly seven tonnes of relief material into small kits was done at the Thevara Gurudwara in Kochi, and 400 to 500 such kits were distributed among the flood-hit daily,



Aided by a few local volunteers, the group is also doled out free medicines and drinking water supplies.

3. Coming to the rescue of Rohingya Muslims

When the Rohingya Muslims fearing persecution fled Myanmar and reached Bangladesh border, Khalsa Aid volunteers from India and other parts of the world reached there and provided them with food and water.

Khalsa Aid

The volunteers of the organisation, started a community service kitchen called Guru ka langar which fed thousands of Rohingya Muslims fleeing Myanmar after Bangladesh government gave the required clearances to begin the relief work.



During those testing times, Khalsa Aid team made sure that the Langar services do not come to a halt at any cost and the refugees at least do not go sleep without food.

4. Provided relief items during Nepal earthquake

In April 2015, Nepal was hit by a strong earthquake, which killed over 8000 people and injured more than 20000. Khalsa Aid was actively involved in coordinating number of relief projects. They set up a kitchen and prepared meals twice a day, serving over 350,000 hot meals over a period of six weeks in Kathmandu.

Khalsa Aid

The team also built more than 500 temporary shelters for displaced families and worked with local government to clear rubble. They collaborated with the United Nations in distributing medicines and infant formula to the needy families.



The UK-based humanitarian relief agency had set up Langar, or free community kitchen, in Kathmandu which provided food for some 3,000 to 4,000 people daily. Then, its teams initiated building semi-permanent shelters in the rural villages.

5. Answered calls for help during Jammu and Kashmir floods

In September 2014, due to heavy monsoons and flash floods, over 400 people lost their lives and thousands of homes were destroyed.

Indian Army was deployed to conduct search and rescue missions. Khalsa Aid, along with the Jammu Kashmir Sikh Professionals (JKSP), responded to the emergency and supported the relief work by initiating two projects.

Khalsa Aid

The team actively participated with the local government and rescued over 50 stranded people. It also provided emergency relief packs, containing clean drinking water, food and sanitary items, to over thousand families.



Expressing gratitude towards the Sikh community, the flood victims, of whom a majority were Muslims, were indebted to the community as they helped them without discriminating on the basis of religion.

6. Helped Malawi flood victims

Phalombe region of Malawi, a country in southeastern Africa, was hit by floods in February 2015, which uprooted many families and destroyed their homes, forcing them to relocate.

Khalsa Aid

An estimated 230,000 people were affected. Due to damaged infrastructure, people there no longer had access to clean drinking water and had to walk for miles to fetch clean water. Khalsa Aid volunteers, along with local communities, contractors and government, mobilized resources to drill water wells and build handpumps across rural Malawi. This made it easy for the local people to fetch water.



The work Khalsa aid has done in the country extends beyond relief material. Malawi, is one of the poorest countries in Africa. and the people were overjoyed at the mere sight of a water pump, which was installed by the organisation in 2019.

With their project Water4Africa, NGO Khalsa Aid is working hard to bring water to the rural communities in Africa.

7. Provided aid in Indonesia Tsunami

In September 2018, a powerful earthquake of an intensity of 7.8 on the Richter Scale hit Indonesia. It created a huge Tsunami which devastated the areas of Palu and Dongalla.

Khalsa Aid

Khalsa Aid International worked closely with the local population and ensured that relief measures reaches the most needy ones. They set up langars in Palu and Dongalla and served food, provided blankets and makeshift shelters to people who were displaced by the Tsunami.



8. Saviours During Chennai Floods

Chennai was ravaged by floods in 2015. Over 150,000 people were affected by this calamity and were in need of dire help. Khalsa Aid volunteers provided much-needed relief to the needy by distributing fruit, bread, clean water and bedsheets.

Khalsa Aid

Khalsa Aid members are distributed emergency supplies to the people of Chennai. Khalsa Aid volunteers also provided food rations to thousands of people.



9. Helping Punjab during floods

In 2007, Punjab faced catastrophic floods which affected over 50,000 people. Many villages were severely hit and more than 11,000 hectares of agricultural land with standing crop suffered severe consequences.

Khalsa Aid came to support the people of Punjab in this tragic time and supplied food rations (rice, wheat, lentils, cooking oil etc.) along with blankets and clothing to affected people.","Sun, 24 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://im.indiatimes.in/content/2021/Jan/9_600826709d56d.jpg,"['relief', 'nomination', 'endless', 'peace', 'food', 'efforts', 'nobel', 'set', 'floods', 'humanitarian', 'aid', 'local', 'prize', 'volunteers', 'khalsa', 'provided', 'water', 'deserves']", 
84,84,FL-2021-000005-IDN,"Storm Christoph: UK flood response improving, but lockdown confused the messaging - The Conversation UK",https://theconversation.com/storm-christoph-uk-flood-response-improving-but-lockdown-confused-the-messaging-153802,"Overlapping disasters struck parts of England and Wales in January as Storm Christoph battered communities which were already suffering from the effects of a prolonged period under lockdown. It was the first time in recent memory that the UK authorities were required to address two such huge events at the same time.

The storm wreaked havoc, threatening thousands of homes and leading to evacuations in some areas. The costs of yet another major storm will be felt by the affected communities for months to come.

The response to Storm Christoph has revealed the UK’s strengths and weaknesses. On the plus side, the authorities are now well versed in handling major floods – learning from previous disasters in Somerset in 2014 and Storm Dennis in 2020.

Extensive early warning, planning, procedures and flood mapping are now in place. Over 300 flood alerts were issued by the Environment Agency in the three days leading up to the storm hitting. This gave communities due warning of the potential of severe flooding. In some instances, prior evacuation by citizens and communities was recommended and indeed required.

So in this sense, crisis communication was good. For the most part, UK emergency planning has become astute at dealing with single hazard emergencies. Incidents that are restricted to geographical areas where local emergency flooding plans can be enacted with more ease.

‘Conflicting advice’

Yet despite a commitment to an “all hazard approach” – planning to meet differing types of shocks and threats – the floods have revealed that the UK is not, in practice, very successful in dealing with overlapping disasters. Multi-hazard threats require agile decision making.

In the case of Storm Christoph, initial indications suggest that there was a lack of joined-up crisis communication which linked flood advice – even evacuation guidance – with the requirements of also meeting COVID-19 lockdown restrictions.

People were, in many instances, not clearly informed about how they were supposed to evacuate their homes and meet the requirements of staying within COVID-19 bubbles. There was confusion over what people should do if they were forced to leave their homes. Could they stay with friends? Or would that put them in danger of COVID-19? As Didsbury West councillor Richard Kilpatrick told the BBC:

You have a situation where, for the last year, people have been repeatedly told to stay at home for their safety suddenly getting this conflicting advice.

Nor was it entirely clear how emergency responders would be able to provide flood-related support without making them further vulnerable to COVID-19 contagion.

Key advice was eventually forthcoming – at least in north-west England – where residents were informed that they were exempt from COVID-19 legislation in this scenario and they should not hesitate to evacuate. But the clarity of this advice was far from uniform across the country and was issued at differing times.

Effective crisis communication relies on a clear and timely framing of the challenge – in this case the overlapping disasters. It is also important to outline what the local capabilities and requirements are. And clear information about how the local population can respond to the crisis is crucial. This applies across the world, from the UK to Africa.

My own research, with colleagues at Bournemouth University, shows that poor framing (such as weak communication) can lead to a lack of compliance. This in turn leads to citizens blaming emergency managers for any failures.

People must have trust and confidence that they are both heeding critical flooding advice and staying compliant with pandemic restrictions. This cannot be ignored: flooding is here to stay and lockdowns may be something we all have to learn to live with for the foreseeable future.","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/380159/original/file-20210122-19-1fs1r0o.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=7%2C838%2C4970%2C2485&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['flooding', 'disasters', 'advice', 'messaging', 'covid19', 'confused', 'communities', 'uk', 'christoph', 'lockdown', 'storm', 'improving', 'emergency', 'communication', 'flood', 'response', 'crisis']", 
85,85,FL-2021-000005-IDN,Earthquake hits already devastated Indonesia | WORLD - WORLD News Group,https://wng.org/roundups/earthquake-hits-already-devastated-indonesia-1617220292,"Corrugated sheets, twisted windowpanes, and concrete rubble littered streets where many buildings once stood in the city of Mamuju on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island. A shallow 6.2-magnitude earthquake rattled the island just after midnight on Friday as many people slept.

Nurwardi, manager of operations at Mamuju’s West Sulawesi General Hospital—the only clinic that survived the earthquake—said people steadily flocked to makeshift tents to receive care. “Many patients do not want to be treated inside the hospital because they’re worried about another quake,” he told the AFP news agency. “Many need surgery but we have limited resources and medicine.”

The earthquake killed at least 90 people, the majority of them in Mamuju, and nearly 300 others sustained serious injuries. Aid workers this week continued to search for survivors and try to access cut-off villages. The quake came in the wake of several other disasters in the country, including the COVID-19 pandemic.

The earthquake destroyed more than 1,000 homes and other buildings, including the governor’s office and a shopping mall in Mamuju. Thousands of people slept outdoors this week for fear of aftershocks. Nearly 30,000 displaced people moved to shelters in Mamuju and its neighboring district of Majene.

A father of three who identified himself as Robert told the Associated Press he was at Mamuju’s Mitra Manakarra hospital when the earthquake began. The rattling bed woke him up, and he pulled out the drip from his hand before running out. “I cried when I saw the hospital where I was being treated collapse with people still inside,” he said. “I could have died if I got out late.”

Didi Hamzar, the disaster agency’s director of preparedness, said rescuers have pulled at least 18 survivors from collapsed buildings. The region set up a navy hospital ship and field health centers to bolster the medical response. The International Red Cross deployed seven ambulances and first-aid teams to the region. Mark Baker, the director of disaster response with Water Mission, told me his team also sent in a mobile unit to deliver clean water to affected communities. The aid group is also assessing the needs before setting up permanent water treatment systems.

Doni Monardo, Indonesia’s disaster agency chief, said authorities would set up COVID-19 testing sites at the camps. Indonesia has recorded more than 927,000 infections and more than 26,000 deaths, the highest in Southeast Asia. Security officers patrolling with loudspeakers reminded people to observe health protocols as markets and gas stations slowly reopened this week.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo mobilized the military and police to aid the rescue and relief operations and pledged more government support during a Tuesday visit to Mamuju: “Soon the central government will rebuild, then for collapsed houses, the government will help for those that were heavily damaged.”

The archipelago nation sits on the “Ring of Fire,” an arch of fault lines in the Pacific Basin, and experiences frequent earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis.

Other disasters have struck the country as well. On Monday, Widodo visited southern regions on Borneo island, where flooding last week killed at least 15 people and forced thousands of people to flee their homes. On Jan. 9, a deadly landslide on Java island buried about 40 people. The same day, a Sriwijaya Air jet crashed into the Java Sea, killing all 62 people on board.

“The people of Indonesia inspire the world community as an example of extraordinary resilience,” said Dr. Vlatko Uzevski, emergency response leader for the nonprofit Project HOPE, which is also responding in Sulawesi.

Young Tunisians have gathered on the streets of the capital city of Tunis and other cities since Friday, throwing Molotov cocktails at security forces and holding posters that read, “Employment is a right, not a favor.” The demonstrations began after the government imposed a nationwide coronavirus lockdown on Thursday, the 10th anniversary of the ouster of authoritarian President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali during the Arab Spring. Authorities have arrested more than 600 people and deployed troops across several cities, defense ministry spokesman Mohamed Zikri said.

One-third of Tunisia’s youth remain unemployed, and the pandemic has worsened the country’s economic crisis. Tunisia has recorded more than 177,000 COVID-19 infections and more than 5,600 deaths. Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi acknowledged the growing frustration but condemned the looting and violence: “Your voice is heard, and your anger is legitimate, and it is my role and the role of the government to work to realize your demands and to make the dream of Tunisia to become true.”

Amnesty International urged security forces to refrain from using excessive force. —O.O.

Gunmen killed two women Supreme Court judges in Afghanistan last week, the latest in a string of assassinations targeting civilians. The women were driving to their office in the capital city of Kabul when gunmen riding motorcycles opened fire on their car, said Ahmad Fahim Qaweem, a spokesperson for the Supreme Court. Police launched an investigation.

Attacks in recent months have targeted government officials, activists, journalists, and prosecutors. The Taliban denied any involvement. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for a November attack on Kabul University that left 22 people dead and 22 others wounded.

The latest violence came two days after the United States said the U.S. troop level in Afghanistan reduced to a record low of 2,500, a stipulation in the U.S.-brokered peace talks. —O.O.

Defense forces in Mozambique’s terrorism-ridden northern province last week rescued 21 hostages abducted by extremists. Authorities said the insurgents captured the 15 women and six children from Matemo island and used them to transport looted goods.

One of the women, Maisha Ambasse, counted up to 30 insurgents and said they planned to take the captives to a Koranic school. Bernardino Rafael, general commander of the police force, said the defense forces knew the terrorists’ location and launched a “smart attack” to rescue the hostages.

A local rebel group called Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama started attacking the port town of Mocímboa da Praia in October 2017. Insurgent attacks in the oil-rich region have killed more than 1,000 civilians and displaced more than 500,000 people.

The African tradition of oral storytelling passed down to family members and communities could soon be available online.

Gen. Rasman MS.

He said his team had checked the location and found nothing there.

""There was nothing there. I have sought confirmation from (the SAR team) members and they have found nothing there,” he stated on Wednesday.

He said bad weather could have prompted fishermen to shelter on the island and use their smartphone to upload the SOS signal.

""Usually fishermen find shelter on the island in the event of bad weather. After they moored their boats, they likely played a game on the hand phone or anything else. Yes, it could be. But it had nothing to do with Sriwijaya,"" he clarified.

Social media has been abuzz after a screenshot began circulating of Google Maps showing an SOS tag on Laki Island, which is close to the suspected site of the Sriwijaya Air plane crash.

However, when ANTARA checked the Google Maps application again at 8 p.m. WIB on Wednesday, the SOS marker had disappeared.

The Sriwijaya Air flight SJ182, bearing the registration number PK-CLC, lost contact at 2:40 p.m. Western Indonesia time (WIB) on January 9, 2021 shortly after take-off and crashed between Lancang Island and Laki Island, Thousand Islands, DKI Jakarta. The plane was headed to Pontianak from Jakarta.

Based on the manifest, the plane had 50 passengers and 12 crew members on board. Of the total passengers, 40 were adults, seven were children, and three were infants.

The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) received a report of the flood at the Riet River on Loch Vaal on Saturday morning, which had stranded a family in their home.

""Our NSRI rescue vehicle, carrying our NSRI Croc and towing our NSRI Discovery Rescue Runner, was dispatched. On arrival on the scene, we were met by Police Search and Rescue who had already managed to safely rescue four of the six residents from the house by wading them through the swollen river,"" said NSRI Vaal Dam station commander Jake Manten.

However, an elderly couple remained stranded in a house, with rapidly flowing waters rising.

Indonesia has pursued a strategy of aggressive arrests and violence against peaceful demonstrations for independence since the announcement of a provisional government of West Papua and rejection of Jakarta’s “Special Autonomy” renewal last month, reports the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP).

ULMWP chair Benny Wenda was named interim President of the provisional government on 1 December 2020 as the Papuan people roundly rejected renewal of the failed 2001 Special Autonomy law.

Highlighting the vast resources the Indonesian state is dedicating to crushing dissent over renewal of Special Autonomy status across West Papua, a large convoy of heavily-armed police vehicles was photographed heading toward demonstrations in Manokwari last week on January 11.

On January 7, West Papuan activist Alvarez Kapisa was arrested by Indonesian security forces.

Kapisa helped organise meetings where West Papuan’s overwhelmingly asserted their rejection of the colonial special autonomy law, calling for their legal right to self-determination, decolonisation and independence.

Nine more Papuans were arrested in Biak and Supiori between January 4-7 by joint Indonesian military and police patrols for questioning over their support for Benny Wenda’s provisional government and rejection of special autonomy.

In Biak, they include Yusup Daimboa, Soleman Rumayomi and Yermias Rabrageri, as well as five villagers in Supirori.

In Serui, Frans Kapisa, Yonathan Ruwayari and Yuliana Rumbara have also been detained. The International Lawyers for West Papua has released a statement condemning their treating.

KNPB leader abducted

On January 4, at 5pm, popular activist and National Committee for West Papua (KNPB) leader Naftall Tipagau was abducted by police intelligence agents, alleged ULMWP.

The husband and father was attacked and dragged into a black van in front of his family, in Intan Jaya, where military operations have displaced over 13,000 people.

He is yet to be released and no charges have been made by police.

Tipagau actively reported in Intan Jaya, where the Indonesian military has recently killed Papuan priests.

The recently discovered Wabu Bloc of gold reserves is planned for extraction by Freeport McMoran, the mining company responsible for decades of environmental destruction and human rights abuses at the Grasberg gold and copper mine in West Papua.

Papuans and political leaders around the world were horrified on January 6 as plans for a complete “ethnic cleansing” of Papuans were revealed by Indonesian General Hendropriyono.

Plan to remove Papuans

The retired Kopassus general and former head of the Indonesian State Intelligence Agency (BIN) declared his proposal to forcibly remove two million Papuans from their homeland and replace them with Indonesians.

He stated his plans for Indonesia to “transmigrate these two million people to Manado and move two million Manadonese over to Papua. What for? So that we could racially separate them from Papuans in PNG, so that they could feel more like Indonesians instead of foreigners”.

This plan for ethnic cleansing matches the history of Indonesian population management, described as settler colonialism by a recent study.

In 1985, the head of the Indonesian “Transmigration” policy of population resettlement described the aim of the programme thus: “The different ethnic groups will in the long run disappear because of integration, and there will be one kind of man.”

That same day, on January 6, Indonesian forces tortured and killed Mispo Gwijangge, a Papuan who was only 14 years old when he was first arrested in 2018. The 16-year-old boy was falsely charged with the killing of 17 Indonesian soldiers in Nduga, and was imprisoned and tortured for 333 days.

In Serui, Papuan elder and chairman of West Papua National Authority (WPNA) Waropen regency, Jeremias Rabrageri, was arrested by colonial Indonesian forces on December 30 along with his son, Reiner Rabrageri, after declaring his support for Benny Wenda’s provisional West Papuan government.

In the week before Christmas, 4850 TNI soldiers were deployed to West Papua to assist the Indonesian police. TNI soldiers were placed throughout West Papua to shut down the peaceful demonstrations marking two decades of failed special autonomy that ended on January 1 and the displays of support for Benny Wenda’s provisional government.

Confession to torture

This deployment comes alongside a confession on December 23 by an Indonesian military chief that TNI soldiers tortured, murdered and burned two West Papuan brothers in their custody, alleges ULMWP.

The bodies of Luther and Apinus Zanambani were then thrown into a river in April 2020.

This is not the only recent execution carried out. On 26 October 2020, Catholic Catechist Rufinus Tigau was also murdered by the TNI in a village raid.

On the anniversary of Indonesia’s 1961 attempted invasion of West Papua, on December 19, Indonesian police arrested both Indonesians and Papuans who came together to peacefully protest 59 years of human rights abuses.

Lombok was the signing place of a notorious treaty between Indonesia and Australia, in which the latter promised to avoid upsetting Indonesia’s occupation of West Papua.

Indonesian police attacked West Papuan students peacefully protesting against Indonesian human rights abuses, arresting 18 students in Nabire on 10 December 2020.

Fourteen members of the National Committee for West Papua (KNPB) were also arrested in Merauke and accused of treason on December 12, including chairman of the Merauke branch Charles Sraun, by Indonesian police, who also destroyed the KNPB office. They remain incarcerated and their families have been denied visitation rights.

Media investigate Indonesian propaganda

In December, Australian and British media began investigating the Indonesian government’s use of propaganda and fake social media accounts.

Indonesian intelligence has been running a coordinated social media campaign to discredit the West Papuan independence movement, attributing online posts supporting Indonesia’s colonisation to UK politicians and Australian officials.

This followed a Bellingcat investigation exposing Indonesia’s creation of fake profiles to disseminate pro-occupation propaganda that have flooded Facebook and Twitter in the past 12 months.

On 12 January 2021, the Netherlands became the 83rd international state calling for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to be allowed into West Papua.

This comes after similar calls by the UK government on November 11 following a declaration of concern over killings of Papuans by Indonesian forces by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.","Thu, 21 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://asiapacificreport.nz/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Militarised-police-convoy-at-Manokwari-ULMWP-680wide.png,"['ethnic', 'special', 'indonesian', 'papua', 'indonesia', 'west', 'papuans', 'accuses', 'papuan', 'cleansing', 'arrested', 'rights', 'provisional', 'aggression', 'human', 'ulmwp']",

The finding described in the journal Science Advances on Wednesday provides the earliest evidence of human settlement in the region.

Co-author Maxime Aubert of Australia's Griffith University told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that it was found on the island of Sulawesi in 2017 by doctoral student Basran Burhan, as part of surveys the team was carrying out with Indonesian authorities.

The Leang Tedongnge cave is located in a remote valley enclosed by sheer limestone cliffs, about an hour's walk from the nearest road.

It is only accessible during the dry season because of flooding during the wet season – and members of the isolated Bugis community told the team it had never before been seen by Westerners.

Measuring 136 by 54 centimeters (53 by 21 inches) the Sulawesi warty pig was painted using dark red ochre pigment and has a short crest of upright hair, as well as a pair of horn-like facial warts characteristic of adult males of the species.

There are two handprints above the pig's hindquarters, and it appears to be facing two other pigs that are only partially preserved, as part of a narrative scene.

""The pig appears to be observing a fight or social interaction between two other warty pigs,"" said co-author Adam Brumm.

Humans have hunted Sulawesi warty pigs for tens of thousands of years, and they are a key feature of the region's prehistoric artwork, particularly during the Ice Age.

Early human migration

Aubert, a dating specialist, identified a calcite deposit that had formed on top of the painting, then used Uranium-series isotope dating to confidently say the deposit was 45,500 years old.

This makes the painting at least that age, ""but it could be much older because the dating that we're using only dates the calcite on top of it,"" he explained.

""The people who made it were fully modern, they were just like us, they had all of the capacity and the tools to do any painting that they liked,"" he added.

The previously oldest dated rock art painting was found by the same team in Sulawesi. It depicted a group of part-human, part-animal figures hunting mammals, and was found to be at least 43,900 years old.

Cave paintings such as these also help fill in gaps about our understanding of early human migrations.

It's known that people reached Australia 65,000 years ago, but they would probably have had to cross the islands of Indonesia, known as ""Wallacea.""

This site now represents the oldest evidence of humans in Wallacea, but it's hoped further research will help show people were in the region much earlier, which would resolve the Australia settlement puzzle.

The team believes the artwork was made by Homo sapiens, as opposed to now-extinct human species like Denisovans, but cannot say this for certain.

To make handprints, the artists would have had to place their hands on a surface then spit pigment over it, and the team is hoping to try to extract DNA samples from residual saliva.","Fri, 15 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2021/01/15/thumbs/800x531/86009.jpg,"['sulawesi', 'painting', 'warty', '45500', 'pigs', 'indonesia', 'known', 'cave', 'oldest', 'dating', 'team', 'human', 'pig', 'worlds']",

For its financial year to November, the company reported a net profit of 1.24 billion Swedish kronor (120 million euros) as sales fell 20 percent to 187 billion kronor.

“Our measures to mitigate the negative effects of ongoing restrictions and closures are continuing,” chief executive officer Helena Helmersson said in a statement.

“Although the situation at the time of writing is highly challenging, the H&M group stands strong.”

Despite continued lockdowns and restrictions, H&M said it would not increase the number of outlets — 350 — targeted for closure in the current year.

At the same time, it would open 100 other stores, as planned.

The business was especially hard hit in its second quarter, the height of the first wave of the pandemic when up to 80 percent of its outlets had to close, H&M said.

Among the worst affected markets, sales in France plunged 28 percent, with Italy down 24 percent, the United States 17 percent and Britain 16 percent.

China and Germany did better, registering losses of just 3.0 percent.

H&M said that conditions had worsened again in the later part of the year as a second wave of the pandemic swept through.

For the three months to November — its fourth quarter — sales tumbled 15 percent to 52.55 kronor, with net profit down 41 percent at 2.49 billion kronor.","Fri, 29 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.macaubusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mb-logo@2x.png,"['wave', 'pandemic', 'slashes', 'net', 'profit', 'hm', '2020', 'second', 'billion', 'sales', 'stores', 'kronor', 'earnings', 'virus', 'crisis']",

Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor, who visited evacuees at Dewan Datuk Sri Panglima Mohd Dun Banir relief centre yesterday, said this would include proposed measures to deepen the Padas River and realigning its riverbanks, among other measures.

“On the part of the state government, we will take into consideration all proposals because we are not going to relent in our efforts to address the flood problem in Beaufort, ” he said.

Beaufort is one of the districts that experienced serious flooding following downpour and the high tide phenomenon last week. The district is also known to be flood-prone, especially if heavy rains occurred in the interior divisions of Tenom and Keningau, causing the river passing by the town to overflow.

Hajiji presented flood evacuees with cash assistance and food baskets, which were also given to flood victims in other districts.

He assured that the state government would do its best to assist the flood victims.

The Chief Minister said while it was unfortunate that flood had been a problem in Beaufort for quite some time, causing much hardship to the people there, it was vital that the residents comply with directives, particularly when it comes to evacuating and moving to higher ground.

In general, he said those at the temporary shelters statewide were advised to always observe the Covid-19 SOP set by the government.

“We don’t want them to be victims of flood and Covid-19 too, ” he said.

Meanwhile, Hajiji also visited the Padas Bridge and Kampung Pimping Paddy Cluster area in Membakut which were flooded.

According to data from the state disaster management committee secretariat, five districts remained affected by floods, with a total of 642 evacuees still located at 10 relief centres as at 4pm yesterday.","Thu, 21 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/newTsol_logo_socmedia.png,"['visited', 'river', 'relief', 'problem', 'beaufort', 'issue', 'victims', 'evacuees', 'resolve', 'state', 'flood', 'yesterday']",

We’ve all heard our fair share of weird or ‘unique’ names, but have you ever met someone who was named after a flood?

On 20 January, a woman gave birth to a baby girl while on a boat in Desa Lok Baintan, Sungai Tabuk, Indonesia due to heavy floods affecting her neighbourhood. As a result of it, she named her child Siti Nur Banjiriah as a result as reported by TRIBUNews.

The mother, Ernawati, was escorted by two midwives onto a boat to get her to a nearby hospital for the birth of her child. However, before they could reach their destination, she felt her baby crowning.

As a result, the two midwives helped deliver her baby girl on the boat instead. One of the midwives, Arfat, explained that Ernawati was already in labour when she got onto the boat.

“When we arrived, she had already dilated and was ready to give birth,” she said to reporters.

Giving birth on a boat in the middle of a flood is something most people can’t say they have done, so to commemorate the event, Ernawati decided to name her daughter after the flood itself.

tamara wibowo architects decided to re-present one of these two retaining walls, turning it into an important element that establishes the meaning of the inner courtyard. this private yard is further defined by the ‘floating’ volume of the second floor that provides shelter to the back of the residence, creating a comfortable outdoor area that feels like an indoor space at the same time.

the residence takes the shape of a steeply angled roof creating an A-frame with a secondary skin made out of custom-designed cement breeze blocks. the facade is completed with a series of protruded corten elements that frame the opening of the residence.besides acting as a passive cooling strategy, the breeze blocks also serve to reduce visual connection from outside to inside, maintaining privacy within the house.

natural elements also play an important role when it comes to the facade, with the design incorporating treewithin the in-between spaces of the dwelling, so that the branches and leaves emerge through the breeze blocks’ small openings. in this way, the facade is formed to be ever-changing, growing along with the surrounding vegetation. the trees are physically intertwined with the architecture, in order to give a dynamic character, as well as a fresh energy to the house.

a spiral staircase was placed in the middle of the house unifying the spaces in the house, rather than breaking them apart. it appears as a sculptural element of the house that creates a sense of movement throughout the interior. facilitating the occupants’ circulation, the distinct staircase makes the house more flexible, convenient and energetic.

There were even up to eight quakes in a day.

“Indonesia is experiencing a significant increase in quake activity, the shock is felt by the people,” said the BMKG quake and tsunami mitigation coordinator, Daryono.

He explained via a written statement today, Jan. 20, that the natural disaster occurred almost every day except on Jan. 10 and 17. On January 14, Indonesian regions were hit by eight strong quakes that were felt by many.

The current condition, according to Daryono, is abnormal. Compared to the quake data in January 2020, there were 54 occurrences in a month. Besides, the cause of the rising activity of powerful quakes had not been discovered yet.

The BMKG suspected that it was attributable to the change in the stress pattern globally, regionally, or even locally, which led to an increase in strong earthquakes. However, Daryono argued that the most important thing is to recognize and differentiate the various kinds of quakes for disaster mitigation purposes.

Text description provided by the architects. Arti Design Studio, in collaboration with Studio Laurencia, has renovated Lei Lo, an Asian fusion restaurant located in Senopati, South Jakarta. In this project, the architects rethink customer journey using transparency design.

The long entrance pathway introduces the customers to Asian fusion concept, starting with a few of its elements: wood and brass tapestry. Here, the customer get a glimpse and a feel to the world inside Lei Lo. nAside from serving as a transition, the area acts as a waiting area (with wooden seats for comfort and standing tables to place coffee) and a shelter from Jakarta’s weathers, be it scorching sun or heavy rainfall. A touch of nature, long grass grows inside a row of planter pots which protects the building from the occasional rainy season floods. The plants also acts as view buffer from dining to parking area.

When it comes to the word Asian, generally, the masses think of ornaments, such as red lanterns. Instead of going with it, Arti Design Studio dig deeper to the roots, researching down to the specific materials. The combination of dark wood and stone makes the entire restaurant feels homy, not only looks Asian. This leaves a deeper impression.

Observing customer behavior, upon entering the room, the customers would choose the best seat—the one with the best view. However, the existing spot were deemed undesirable as it faces parking area and basks in Jakarta sun heat. For that reason, the architects design buffers (brass tapestry structure and planter box) hence resulted in attractive view and unique shadow play. Seeing from business point of view, the design increases capacity efficiency.

The VIP room was secluded yet lively. Its rattan door allows the VIP costumers to see the silhouette movements from the other side of the restaurant, giving the customers a sense of privacy and belonging at the same time. Arti Design Studio makes sure its design gives the best experience. Aside from giving touches of nature, planter boxes that surround the tables also acts as view buffers to the waiters passing by. The plants also hide service station behind the blue box. This way, the customers’ experience won’t be disturbed by the service scenes.

One of the problems to tackle in the renovation is the existing floor to floor height. To create a taller illusion, the architects designed open plafond with squares to hide air conditioner and exhaust. These squares are repetitions from the brass tapestry outside and ceramic tiles inside. Its overall cohesiveness helps create a strong visual brand identity that is memorable for the customers.","Wed, 20 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/6007/0069/63c0/1724/cf00/01d0/large_jpg/Jonathan_Raditya_-_01_FI.jpg?1611071575,"['planter', 'customers', 'design', 'architects', 'arti', 'view', 'asian', 'tapestry', 'inside', 'studio', 'leilo', 'restaurant']",

98,98,FL-2021-000005-IDN,Indonesians to start negotiations with Mexican live exporters as Aussie feeder cattle rise to record prices - Beef Central,https://www.beefcentral.com/live-export/indonesians-to-start-negotiations-with-mexican-live-exporters-in-response-to-record-high-aus-feeder-cattle-prices/,"INDONESIANS are understandably concerned with the sudden rise in live cattle prices especially at this time when their domestic economy is under great pressure from the pandemic.

As of last week, rises in the cost of slaughter cattle has led to the Meat Traders Association refusing to trade cattle and beef for a four-day period.

Consumers are naturally concerned with the resulting scarcity with politicians being asked to do something, but what can they do?

The underlying cause of the rise in the retail prices is the high cost of live cattle imports from Australia.

As the graph below shows the rates for feeder steers from the port of Darwin have risen over 40 percent from a low of AUD$2.80 per kg live weight in April 2020 to $4 per kg in November 2020.

At the same time, the dark blue line below shows Indonesian slaughter cattle prices (at the feedlot gate) have remained relatively constant as importers have absorbed the additional costs at the expense of their own cash flows in the hope that the rise would be short lived.

Indonesian authorities have advised that they will target imports of 502,000 live cattle and 85,000 tons of beef during 2021 “to help plug the supply gap of meat in the domestic market. In addition Indonesia is also planning to issue import permits for 100,000 tons of Brazilian beef and water buffalo meat from India”.

With Australian live cattle so expensive, importers have searched worldwide for alternatives and found that Mexico is currently a possibility.

Mexico exports over a million head of live cattle into the USA every year so their health status is very high, certainly suitable for imports to Indonesia.

Preliminary quotes obtained by Indonesian importers suggest that by using the largest ship available, 23,000 head of feeder bulls could be delivered from Mexico to Jakarta for a CIF price of USD3.30 per kg.

This also requires multiple shipments to have any meaningful effect.

By comparison, the current CIF rates for delivery of feeder steers from Darwin is around USD$3.80 or close to AUD$5 per kg.

I have contacted an old friend from the live cattle business in Mexico and here is his response:

“Cattle prices in Mexico have been reasonably stable. The Mexican Peso has been strong against the USD at 20 peso = 1.00USD. Today you could buy Indo type young bulls 325kg average for USD$2.10/kg on farm. In the event of a shipment (in my view) these prices will jump to USD 2.35/kg on farm. My current estimates are FOB Mexican Pacific Port USD2.75/kg with CIF Indonesian port USD3.75/kg.”

Perhaps other exporters can provide a better deal. Financing such a large deal with a long lead time will also be a challenge.

In addition to the costs and logistics of the import process there are also large bureaucratic hurdles to jump as I expect that Indonesia will not have an existing live cattle import protocol established with Mexico.

Normally there would be a series of personal visits by a large number of animal health experts from Jakarta to the import destination but that will be not be possible at the moment due to the pandemic. Indonesia does have an embassy in Mexico City so they may well be able to achieve the result quickly with local staff and digital communications.

Indonesian importers know from long experience that the price of cattle in Australia is driven solely by market forces while the Indonesian government has actively held the price of fresh meat down by the threat of sanctions against lot feeders if slaughter cattle prices rise above their declared maximum.

Last year the Indonesian government dropped the 5 percent import tax on live cattle so there is little more that can be done at their end to further cut the cost of imports.

The only entity that has any scope to reduce costs is the Australian government which has recently imposed a number of additional costs onto the export industry with the introduction of ASEL 3.0 and upgraded version of the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock.

Some of these new costs which have been in place since November 2020 include requirements for additional stockmen, more space for certain classes of stock, extra time in quarantine yards and others.

With Townsville prices for slaughter stock also rising to $4 per kg live for Vietnamese slaughter cattle it would not be surprising if they are not already investigating alternative supplies as well. As Vietnam is endemic for Foot and Mouth Disease they have many other countries to pick from such as Colombia and Brazil where cattle are much cheaper than in Mexico.

As a famous financial analyst recently said, “the cure for high prices is high prices”, meaning that if the price is so high that the customer is unable to pay then the demand disappears and the price returns to a workable level.

The market will always figure it out, the question we don’t know is how long it will take.

In the meantime the best we can do is communicate with our customers to assure them that we understand their position and that if there is anything practical that we can do to assist then we will do our best to help.","Mon, 25 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.beefcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-1-25-livex-price-chart.png,"['mexican', 'rise', 'cattle', 'slaughter', 'negotiations', 'feeder', 'indonesian', 'mexico', 'costs', 'price', 'record', 'start', 'prices', 'indonesians', 'exporters', 'import', 'live', 'high']",

JAKARTA (CNA) – The flimsy, makeshift bamboo walkway creaked and bent as Ade Djuhana treaded his steps carefully metres above trash-strewn water in a coastal area of Jakarta.

At the end of the 500-metre passageway, the rows of mangrove trees opened up revealing a wetland devastated by a recent storm surge. About 5,000 trees in just one corner of the wetland, he said, were lost to the incoming waves.

Across the wetland, there are sections where massive mangrove trees sat lopsided, stacked on top of each other with huge chunks of their roots jutting out of the water.

Djuhana said another strong wave, which occurred much earlier, was responsible for the destruction.

Djuhana is the caretaker of Jakarta’s last remaining mangrove forests. He works at the Jakarta Parks and Forestry Agency as chief of the Pantai Indah Kapuk mangrove ecotourism and protected forest unit.

Mangrove trees were once abundant across the Indonesian capital’s 30-kilometre coastline but the need for large container ports, housing and fish farms had caused the mangroves to disappear.

Today, the mangrove trees are confined to several areas, measuring a total of 320-hectare, in the north-western part of the sprawling megacity. These areas are under the protection of the Jakarta government, while there are also mangroves growing in private properties or out at sea in small uninhabited islands and islets. The latter come under the Environment Ministry’s jurisdiction.

The mangrove trees in mainland Jakarta are marked for new destruction, this time from the imminent threat of climate change.

“The waves are getting bigger and bigger and happening more and more frequently,” Djuhana told CNA of the dire consequences of a changing climate.

The waves also bring mountains of trash – mainly plastic bottles, bags and cups – and when they get caught up in the trees’ peg-like breathing roots, the mangroves would suffocate and die.

Climate change is also to blame for more extreme rainfall causing nearby rivers to overflow during the rainy season.

When that occurs, such as the massive fluvial flood which took place early last year, the brackish water in which mangroves thrive, loses its salinity. The floods are sometimes so bad, the trees could be submerged for weeks.

Then there is the rising sea level, high level of pollution in the waters and the fact that some parts of Jakarta, including where the mangroves are located, are sinking at a rate of up to 26-centimetre a year.

“Anywhere else, the mangroves would be pushed further and further inland,” non-for-profit organisation Wetlands International-Indonesia Director Nyoman Suryadiputra told CNA.

“In Jakarta, however, the mangroves had nowhere to go, because all around them, land has been converted into residential and commercial areas,” he said.

Mangrove forests that often line the shorelines across the tropics provide a wide array of environmental services.

They serve as spawning grounds and nurseries for fish and as habitat for a plethora of organisms. Mangroves also protect coastal areas from storm surges and hurricanes as well as erosions.

In Jakarta, mangrove forests act as sanctuaries for the long-tailed macaques and various local and migratory birds, some of which are endangered.

Bogor Institute of Agriculture lecturer Nyoto Santoso who has been studying mangroves in Jakarta, said mangroves are also great carbon sequesters.

“Mangroves are three to five times more effective in absorbing carbon emission than ordinary trees in the upland areas. That’s why we need to preserve the mangroves in Jakarta,” he told CNA.

Studies from various institutions have shown that mangrove trees and the soil beneath them can store anywhere from 20 to 89 tonnes of carbon per hectare.

“Losing mangrove, however small, has a very significant environmental impact. We will lose the ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere and all the carbon which had accumulated in trees and soils would escape back into the atmosphere,” Santoso said.

“Losing the mangroves means Jakarta will lose its last remaining sanctuary for biodiversity,” he said.

Mangroves used to dominate Jakarta’s coastal landscape with trees growing more than three kilometres from the coastline.

Today, mangrove trees can only be found in some sections of Jakarta’s Pantai Indah Kapuk, Kamal Muara and Muara Angke areas – all within minutes’ drive from each other – surrounded by busy streets, toll roads, upscale housing areas and tall apartments and office buildings.

In the mid-1990s, the Indonesian government decided to designate these patches of mangrove forests as protected forests and wildlife sanctuaries.

The government also decided to re-forest eroding fish and shrimp farms.

Santoso said in terms of quantity, there are more mangrove trees in Jakarta today than in 1997, when he first began studying the city’s mangrove ecosystem.

“There have been many universities, organisations and businesses donating money and planting mangrove propagules. The mangrove population is increasing but ecologically speaking they are not healthy and getting sicker and sicker,” he said.

Santoso said the rivers which supply freshwater into these ecosystems are polluted by domestic, commercial and industrial waste, with unsafe levels of mercury and lead found in the water and sediments.

The poor water quality makes the mangrove more susceptible to diseases and more sensitive towards environmental changes.

“Climate change will cause sea levels to rise. It will cause many areas to be flooded and we could see changes in the type of mangrove species dominating the landscape,” he said.

But the damage caused by sea level rise is nothing compared to the threat posed by land subsidence, which is mainly caused by over-extraction of groundwater.

“Because of land subsidence, the soil now sit 2.5-metre to four-metre (below the water surface) in some locations,” Head of the conservation unit at the Jakarta Parks and Forestry Agency Arie Fajar Septa told CNA.

This causes some species of mangroves to drown and die and makes the process of replacing them with new plants extremely difficult.

“It is hard to directly plant the mangroves into the soil because propagules can only survive in water between 0.5-metre and one-metre deep,” he said.

Djuhana said his team is fighting a never-ending battle against sinking land and changing climate.

Workers have erected breakwaters to protect the mangroves from strong waves and built bamboo fences to stop trash from the sea and rivers from encroaching the delicate ecosystems.

They have also backfilled some sections where land is subsiding to stop mangrove propagules from drowning and give them a chance to grow into full-sized mangrove trees.

“But sometimes the waves are so big that the entire forest would drown. Water would swell by another metre and thousands of trees are destroyed,” he said, adding that storm surges would also decimate mangrove propagules before they have a chance of developing.

However, Djuhana is not giving up. As soon as one section is destroyed, his team get to work to replant it with new mangroves.

“It could take months to replant the mangroves before they take root, and they could be destroyed in a blink of an eye when the storm comes,” he said.

“But we have to do it. This is the last place in Jakarta where wild animals roam free. The last place in Jakarta where people can explore the forests and enjoy some fresh air.

“The last place where children and their parents can learn about the mangrove ecosystem. We have to protect the mangrove trees.”","Tue, 26 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/P22-A_26012021.jpg,"['forests', 'jakarta', 'change', 'trees', 'climate', 'sea', 'water', 'ecosystem', 'areas', 'carbon', 'threat', 'mangroves', 'land', 'mangrove', 'subsidence', 'city']",
