Jakarta experienced on Tuesday night its worst rainfall in over a decade, with heavy rain pouring over the city nonstop until Wednesday morning, causing severe flooding in the capital and its satellite cities on the first day of 2020.

The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) recorded rainfall intensity on New Year’s Eve at 377 millimeters per day, according to an observation conducted at Halim Perdanakusuma Air Force Base in East Jakarta.

Meanwhile, observations at Taman Mini Indonesia Indah, also in East Jakarta, and Jatiasih in Bekasi recorded rainfall intensity at 335 and 259 mm per day, respectively.

The figures are the highest in the city since 2007, when rainfall intensity reached 340 mm per day.

“The rain falling on New Year’s Eve in the western and northern parts of Java was very extreme and triggered floods in [Greater Jakarta] and Cikampek [in West Java]. This rain is not ordinary rain,” the agency wrote in a statement.

The BMKG said the nearly record-high rainfall intensity was due to several factors, including the occurrence of a monsoon. According to the United Kingdom’s Met Office, a monsoon climate is characterized by “a dramatic seasonal change in direction of the prevailing winds of a region which brings a marked change in rainfall”.

“Wind moving from the northeast of Java Island met with another wind blowing from the south of the island. Such an encounter has led to the massive formation of clouds in the sky above Java Island,” the head of the BMKG’s public meteorology center, Fachri Radjab, said in a video uploaded by the agency’s official YouTube account.

He added the weather conditions had been worsened by a high amount of water vapor caused by the high temperatures of the Indian Ocean, especially in areas south of Java Island. “The water vapor later affected cloud formations over Java,” Fachri said.

The BMKG predicted heavy rain to continue in Greater Jakarta until Saturday as a result of the atmospheric conditions.

Multiple provinces (North Sumatera, West Java, Bengkulu and Jakarta) in Indonesia has been experiencing flooding starting from 28 December 2019. The floods are affecting the provinces at different scales. The total numbers of people affected have not been confirmed as assessments are ongoing. Below are some details by localities.

Flash Flooding in North Sumatera province

Due to heavy and intense rainfall in the area, flash flooding occurred and affected four villages (Pematang, Hatapang, Batu Tunggal and Merbau Selatan) in Labuhanbatu Utara districts. Approximately 229 households (857 people) have been affected by the flash floods. In addition, 39 houses have been severely damaged, 83 moderately damaged, and eight houses washed away by the flash floods. According to Indonesia Search and Rescue Agency (BASARNAS), one household (five family members) remains missing or washed away by the flash floods. Search and rescue efforts to find the missing family are ongoing.

Furthermore, there are four evacuation points in the area, currently occupied by 861 people; Siria-ria evacuation point A (306 people), Siria-ria evacuation point B (241 people), Tunggal Batu evacuation point (four people) and Hatapang evacuation point (310 people).

Floods in West Java Province

Due to heavy rainfall on 31 December 2019 in West Java Province, a river embankment collapsed in Cimareme village, Ngamprah sub-district, West Java district. According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency Provincial Level / Badan Penanggulangan Bencana Daerah (BPBD), approximately 131 households and 15 houses have been affected by the floods.

Evacuation efforts are ongoing in the area. Most of the affected families are being evacuated to two mosques (At-Tin and AlIkhlas mosques). Assessment for detailed impact, needs and information remains ongoing and approximately 13,000 people have been affected by the flood (assessment is underway for accurate figures).","Wed, 01 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1434703-IBIDfl010120.png?itok=g6puCvuG,"['provinces', 'information', 'jakarta', 'sumatera', 'evacuation', 'point', 'java', 'indonesia', 'affected', 'ongoing', 'flooding', 'floods', 'houses', 'dki', 'west', 'flash', 'north']",

Nonstop rainfall Tuesday and Wednesday flooded 268 tracts in Indonesia, 158 in low-lying Jakarta, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said on its website. Drainage and levees in the capital are considered inadequate for storms of that scale, Southeast Asian economists say.

Tuesday’s rainfall reached 377 millimeters (14.8 inches), a record since 2007, The Jakarta Post online said. The rains touched off landslides, trapped people in houses and prompted more than 19,000 to evacuate, local media reports say. The Red Cross federation put the number of displaced people at 31,232.

Trapped at home

“We even couldn’t get out of our house, we even felt like we were in the middle of a big pond,’’ said Paramita Supamijoto, an international relations lecturer at Bina Nusantara University in Jakarta.

Water levels inside her house topped out around 40 centimeters (15.7 inches) above the floor, she told VOA by phone.

“The water outside our house was higher, I think about 50 or 60 centimeters (19.6-23.6 inches), almost half the height of the average adult,” she said. It left a stench and trail of dirt after receding.

The Red Cross federation said flooding had injured 100 people. It called for donations of food, sleeping mats, baby kits, clean water and medicine. Some houses flooded up to their second stories.

More flood control

Citizens of the city of 11 million want the government to improve flood control work, although much has been done already, said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at market research firm IHS Markit. President Joko Widodo in July suggested building a seawall around Jakarta, much of which is below sea level.

Officials may come out with a new “range of commitments” after the floods, Biswas said.

The biggest step would be relocation of the giant archipelago’s capital to a site in East Kalimantan on Borneo Island. The president announced that move in August following three years of studies. The sparsely populated new site has a seaport, airport, low poverty levels and an educated population.

“I don’t expect that this [flooding] in itself would be a cause of political unrest,” Biswas said. “If anything, it would probably support the case that President Jokowi [Joko Widodo] has been pushing to build a new capital city, which will be in a very different location in another island, and one of the reasons for building that new city is to create a site that’s less vulnerable to these risks of flooding and also other natural disasters.”

A man collects a water to clean his flooded house in Tanggerang on the outskirts of Jakarta, Indonesia, Jan. 3, 2020.

Analysts caution, though, that relocation would take years. In the meantime, Jakarta would remain heavily populated and packed with visitors as the hub of government.

Jakarta is also known for air pollution and a dense population including families who live in lean-tos along riverbanks.

Housing shouldn’t be built in flood zones and people should quit throwing trash in the rivers, Supamijoto said. She suggested that river channels be “normalized.”

The urban drainage system struggles during major floods, Biswas said.

“Moving the capital is also a good idea but it cannot be done within a few minutes because Jakarta has been our capital for a long time and socially people already get used to it,” Supamijoto said.

“And then if you would like to move us to [the new capital], that might be a lot of process, a lot of issues and we cannot guarantee that the new capital will be safe from flooding and other natural disasters,” she said.

Jakarta is used to floods and should recover economically within a few weeks, said Marie Diron, managing director with Moody’s Investors Service in Singapore. Flooding in January 2013 killed dozens and swamped Jakarta’s central business district.

“We’ll observe the speed of recovery, what measures are taken to remedy the impact of the flood,” Diron said. She assumes Indonesia will return to “some sort of normal economic activity” within a few weeks and will take a second look at the country if not.

Rainfall is forecast to pick up over the next four to seven days, meaning “water levels will further increase,” the Red Cross federation said.","Fri, 03 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/reuters-pictures/2020/01/RTS2WZ0X.jpg,"['jakarta', 'flood', 'infrastructure', 'raise', 'red', 'capital', 'flooded', 'indonesia', 'water', 'flooding', 'house', 'floods', 'federation', 'urgency', 'deadly']",

Rapid urbanisation has led to forest loss, while groundwater extraction is causing the coastal city to sink as sea levels rise - a dangerous cocktail that is worsening floods

KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Indonesia's flood-hit capital Jakarta must protect and plant trees, stop extracting so much groundwater, and develop long-term plans together with surrounding towns if it is to keep pace with the growing threats from climate change, green groups said.

Since Dec. 31, some of the heaviest rain since records began has caused chaos in the mega-city, killing at least 60 people and displacing nearly 175,000 - and more rain is forecast for this month.

""Indonesia has got enough resources to deal with these problems,"" said Leonard Simanjuntak, country director for Greenpeace Indonesia in Jakarta.

""However, for decades, political leaders never really had any consistency in implementing long-term plans for flood management,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Southeast Asia's biggest city is located by the coast and built on a swampy plain, with 40% lying below sea level.

More than 10 rivers flow through the capital, but the water catchment areas and forests around it have been largely converted over decades for residential and agricultural use, falling victim to rapid urbanisation.

The capacity of Jakarta's rivers has also shrunk because of sedimentation, poor waste management and illegal settlements, meaning remaining waterways tend to clog up during heavy rains.

Making matters worse, most residents and businesses rely on wells that drain underground aquifers for their water supplies, causing the city to sink by 5-10 cm (2-4 inches) each year.

Rising sea levels and the inability of infrastructure to cope with excess water during the monsoon season have resulted in regular flooding in the city, which is home to more than 10 million people.

Jakarta's authorities must dredge and clean up its rivers and waterways, and help communities access water without huge, uncontrolled groundwater extraction, said Milag San Jose-Ballesteros, director of East, Southeast Asia and Oceania for the C40 Cities network.

Many cities, meanwhile, are now looking at nature-based solutions, such as turning concrete drainage and grey infrastructure back into flood-plains, she added.

SLOW TO ACT

Hidayah Hamzah, a forests expert at think-tank World Resources Institute Indonesia, said Jakarta could not solve its flooding problem alone.

""The city needs to collaborate with surrounding areas,"" he said, adding the government should stop further urban conversion of forested areas and watersheds.

San Jose-Ballesteros noted that collaboration and alignment of long-term plans across cities and regions ""would be crucial in addressing the issue"".

Swathes of Jakarta and nearby towns were inundated after heavy rain fell at the turn of the year.

The rainfall at the start of 2020 was one of the most extreme events since records began in 1866, said Indonesia's state weather agency.

But Jakarta is no stranger to encroaching water. More than 50 people died in one of its deadliest floods in 2007 and five years ago much of the centre was inundated when canals overflowed.

Past floods highlight the importance of better early warning systems and community preparedness, said Abhas Jha, East Asia and Pacific manager for urban development and disaster risk at the World Bank.

The government has decided to move the administrative functions of the capital to Borneo island from 2024, to help reduce population pressure on Jakarta.

But it has pledged to spend $40 billion to save the slowly sinking city over the next decade.

Plans to improve Jakarta's flood defences include building two dams and works on the city's biggest river.

President Joko Widodo has blamed the flooding on delays to those infrastructure projects caused by land acquisition and other problems.

Shobhakar Dhakal, a professor in the department of energy, environment and climate change at the Asian Institute of Technology, said the situation was not yet out of control but immediate action was needed to tackle the risks.

""I wish the decision-makers (would) learn faster... to address a crisis which is only going to increase,"" he said.

Indonesians are no strangers to disaster, both natural and manmade. But in the face of such trials, the people of the archipelago are known to tap into their unique brand of quirky humor to cope and bring light to even the grimmest of circumstances.

Since the start of widespread flooding across Greater Jakarta, Banten and other parts of Indonesia on Tuesday, videos and memes have been circulating online showing people choosing to find the funny side of grappling with rising water levels.

One video shows a red angkot (public minivan) barreling through the 1-meter floodwaters of an inundated street in Banten, with a laughing crowd cheering its driver on. The clip has been viewed more than 780,000 times on Twitter over the last two days.

To the crowd’s surprise, the angkot managed to cross the flooded road and continue on its daily route – passengers grinning and clapping in the back.

In another video, a man can be seen sitting on his motorcycle on the side of yet another inundated road. An orange truck comes into view and passes him at a relatively high speed, causing roll after roll of brown waves that crashed into him. The motorcyclist was unable to keep his balance and fell into floodwater.

In yet a different video, a girl was shown “rescuing” a life-sized cardboard cutout of Canadian singer Justin Bieber from her flooded house.

""Rescuing @justinbieber from Jakarta's flood,"" the caption read.

A young man was also recorded kayaking in front of the flooded Trisaksti University, West Jakarta, in a video posted on Dec. 31.

Some residents chose to take advantage of the floods by fishing in front of their house, their kitchen or even from their bed.

One father decided to record his son as he was fishing in front of their home.

""Pull, come on pull son, come on,"" he laughed and shouted as his son reeled in an orange fish with his fishing rod.

""Yeay [...] we caught a fish,"" the father yelled. ""Thank you, Jakarta, for the water so we could fish in front of our house, right son?""

Another video shows a woman trying to catch two huge catfish that had been carried into her house by floodwaters.

""Wohoo, we got fish!"" she said while trying to nudge them out from underneath a shelf using a broomstick.

Massive floods marked the first day of 2020 in Greater Jakarta on Wednesday after heavy rains pounded the the capital and its peripheral areas since New Year’s Eve.

The rain that has soaked the capital city since Tuesday has caused floods in housing areas, at Halim Perdanakusuma Airport in East Jakarta and disrupted train networks.

The Transportation Ministry’s air transportation director-general, Polana B. Pramesti, said the airport has been closed since midnight, since its runways were inundated by up to 80 centimeters of water.

“We can’t predict when the water will recede,” she said in a statement.

At least 10 flights were reportedly delayed while others have been redirected to Soekarno-Hatta Airport in Banten.

Many train trips in Greater Jakarta were also disrupted because of water that had submerged stretches of railway tracks along the Manggarai to Tanah Abang line. Railway tracks in Tanah Abang Station in Central Jakarta were submerged under as much as 50 cm of water, causing state-owned train operator PT KAI to temporarily stop commuter line trains operating from Tanah Abang to the Serpong, Maja, and Rangkasbitung stations in Tangerang.

The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) has reported that at least seven subdistricts in four districts were hit by floods on Tuesday, submerging housing areas and streets. Areas in Central Jakarta, South Jakarta, North Jakarta, East Jakarta and West Jakarta were affected by flooding.

In East Jakarta, 12 neighborhood units in Cipinang Melayu were inundated 30 cm to 80 cm deep by the overflowing Sunter River while Pinang Ranti was inundated by from 20 cm to 70 cm of water.

In North Jakarta, areas affected by floods included Cilincing, Kelapa Molek and East Kelapa Gading, while in West Jakarta, 11 neighborhood units in Cengkareng were hit by floods 60 cm to 70 cm deep.

In South Jakarta floodwaters inundated one neighborhood unit in South Manggarai and Tebet up to 90 cm deep.

Several areas in Greater Jakarta were also affected by floods. In Pondok Gede and Rawa Panjang, Bekasi, West Java, floodwaters have inundated several residential areas.

In Tangerang, Banten, floods hit the Pulo Indah housing complex in Cipindoh with water reaching depths of up to about 1 meter.

Sabrina, one of the residents, said floodwaters came to the area at about 3 a.m. ""The last time we experienced flooding was in 2012. Usually, floodwaters never inundated our houses.""

Floods also caused landslides in Bojongkulur and Bumi Mutiara Bogor, West Java, resulting in heavy damage to two houses.

Flooding also disrupted several roads in the capital city. The Jatinegara toll road was inundated by up to 60 cm at the 3.8-kilometer point, causing all vehicles to be rerouted to Rawamangun exit toll.



Floodwaters inundated the Joglo toll road's exit in Srengseng, Kembangan, West Jakarta by up to 50 cm and Jl. Daan Mogot in Cengkareng, West Java. Several motorcyclists were trapped in the areas because the water caused their machines to break down.



""I could not turn on my motorcycle because water has entered the muffler,"" Supriadi, one of the motorcyclists, said as reported by kompas.com.

Several other roads were also affected by floods, like Jl. Perintis Kemerdekaan in Kelapa Gading, North Jakarta, and the Cawang Interchange Tunnel in East Jakarta, which were submerged up to 50 cm deep.

Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan has instructed officials in the Jakarta administration to get directly involved and help evacuate the affected areas.

""I want all the officials in the Jakarta administrations to make sure that all government buildings and schools are ready to be used as evacuation shelters.

Around Jakarta, more than 170,000 people took refuge in shelters across the massive urban conglomeration after whole neighborhoods were submerged.



Torrential rains that started on New Year's Eve unleashed flash floods and landslides.



Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency said Saturday that two people were also killed after flash floods and landslides hit a village in North Sulawesi on Friday.



The agency said Saturday that the total death toll had climbed to 60 with two people still missing.



""We've discovered more dead bodies,"" said National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo.

‘Trauma healing’

Jakarta shelters filled up with refugees, including infants, resting on thin mats as food and drinking water ran low. Some had been reduced to using floodwater for cleaning.



""We're cleaning ourselves in a nearby church but the time has been limited since it uses an electric generator for power,"" said Trima Kanti, 39, from one refuge in Jakarta's western edges.

In hard-hit Bekasi, on the eastern outskirts of Jakarta, swamped streets were littered with debris and crushed cars lying on top of each other — with waterline marks reaching as high as the second floors of buildings.



On Friday, the government said it would start cloud seeding to the west of the capital — inducing rain using chemicals sprayed from planes — in the hope of preventing more rain from reaching the city region.



Water has receded in many areas and power was being restored in hundreds of districts.



The health ministry has said it deployed 11,000 health workers and soldiers to distribute medicine, hygiene kits and food in a bid to stave off outbreaks of hepatitis A, mosquito-borne Dengue fever and other illnesses, including infections linked to contact with dead animals.



Visiting hard-hit Lebak, Muhadjir Effendy, coordinating minister for human development and cultural affairs, said the government would help rebuild destroyed schools and construct temporary bridges, while offering assistance to victims.



""We're also asking for [nongovernmental organizations] to help with trauma healing,"" Muhadjir told reporters Saturday.

Electrocution, drowning

Around Jakarta, a family that included a 4- and a 9-year-old died of suspected gas poisoning from a portable power generator, while an 8-year-old boy was killed in a landslide.



Others died from drowning or hypothermia, while one 16-year-old boy was electrocuted by a power line.

Jakarta is regularly hit by floods during the rainy season, which started in late November. But this week marked Jakarta's deadliest flooding since 2013 when dozens were killed after the city was inundated by monsoon rains.



Urban planning experts said the disaster was partly due to record rainfall. But Jakarta's myriad infrastructure problems, including poor drainage and rampant overdevelopment, have worsened the situation, they said.

Heavy rainfall caused flooding as deep as 2 meters at the Padalarang underpass in West Bandung regency, West Java, which Regent Aa Umbara Sutisna blamed on the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway construction project.

The flood subsequently led to heavy congestion on the regency’s major thoroughfare as well as an alternative route to Lembang, which lasted for hours and affected hundreds of vehicles.

The Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway project is being carried out by the Indonesian-Chinese consortium, PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (KCIC).

""There were no floods before the KCIC project. The West Bandung administration is not responsible for the floods; it’s the high-speed railway project,"" the regent said.



He urged KCIC to take action and prevent further flooding in the Padalarang underpass.

“[Representatives of] KCIC must come soon. The flooding must stop. It shouldn't harm the people of West Bandung.”

Additionally, dozens of families in Margajaya village, Ngamprah subdistrict, West Bandung regency, were forced to leave their homes and take shelter at nearby mosques on Tuesday afternoon, when an embankment burst following heavy rain.

West Java Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD West Java) operational control manager Budi Budiman Wahyu said heavy rainfall coupled with the broken embankment had led to flooding in residential areas.

""Flood waters reached 70 to 180 centimeters in depth. Houses were inundated,"" he said.



A search and rescue (SAR) team has evacuated 31 families affected by the floods. Twenty-one of them have taken shelter at Attin mosque and the remaining at Al-Ikhlas mosque.

""Their houses are filled with mud, so victims will have to temporarily take shelter,"" said SAR Bandung team leader Edwin Purnama.



Another 131 families have been affected by the recent floods, the team said.



Aa Umbara has instructed BPBD West Java to build a temporary embankment by using sand bags.



""I don't know whether the embankment was built by the Public Works Agency or a private developer, so I’m not sure about its quality,"" he said.","Wed, 01 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/01/01/2020_01_01_84194_1577856504._large.jpg,"['embankment', 'team', 'bandung', 'railway', 'blames', 'java', 'regent', 'unprecedented', 'floods', 'flooding', 'shelter', 'project', 'west', 'jakartabandung', 'highspeed']",

State-owned electricity firm PLN has temporarily shut down electricity in parts of Jakarta for safety reasons after heavy rains caused severe floods in the capital city from Tuesday evening to Wednesday morning.

In a press statement issued on Wednesday, the firm said that as of 9:30 a.m., power in 724 flood-hit areas in the city had been shut down to prevent any electricity-related accidents.

The areas included, but were not limited to, Karet Pasar Baru Barat and its surroundings, Kedoya Utara, Tanjung Duren, Pancoran, Pejaten Timur, Jati Petamburan, Kebon Jeruk Raya and Raya Daan Mogot.

""We are very sorry for the incident. We will secure the electricity until it is safe so that people won't experience any electric shocks,"" PLN Jakarta's distribution unit general manager, Ikhsan Asaad, said in the statement.

The firm also suggested that flood-affected residents turn off their electricity through their meter circuit breakers, unplug any devices still attached to electricity sockets, put their electric devices in higher and safer places and request a shut down through the 123 PLN Mobile application or at the nearest PLN office.

Once the floods subside, PLN recommended that people ensure their electric devices and electricity networks were dry before putting them to use. The firm said it would do the same with its own networks.

“The government is still working on this and our efforts have yet to be complete -- for example [the construction of] the Cimahi and Ciawi dams [in West Java]. Their construction will perhaps be completed by next year. Everything must be completed,” Jokowi told journalists in Yogyakarta on Wednesday.

He added that both the central and regional governments must work together to solve the problem.

Massive floods inundated Greater Jakarta on Wednesday, the first day of 2020, after heavy rains pounded the capital and its peripheral areas since New Year’s Eve. Floodwaters deluged housing areas and other facilities, such as railway tracks and the Halim Perdanakusuma Airport in East Jakarta.

State-owned electricity company PLN temporarily shut down electricity in 724 flood-hit areas across the city to prevent electricity-related accidents.

The flooding, among the deadliest in years, caused chaos in parts of Southeast Asia's biggest city with train lines blocked and power outages in some areas. Swathes of Jakarta and nearby towns were inundated after heavy rain fell on Dec. 31 and into the early hours of New Year's Day.

Social affairs ministry data showed 26 people were killed in the flooding, up from the earlier toll of 21.

As of Thursday morning, over 62,000 people were evacuated in Jakarta alone, disaster mitigation agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said, although later in the day he told news channel Metro TV the number of evacuees were down to around 35,000 people.

Rainfall at an airport in East Jakarta measured at 377 millimeters (15 inches) early on Jan. 1, the highest daily reading during major floods since at least 1996, according to the Meteorology, Clilmatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG).

Umar Dani, 52, and his family were evacuated overnight from his home in East Jakarta on a rubber boat after water levels rose up to his neck.

""It has not flooded for so long here. We didn't have the chance to bring anything,"" he said.

""I have to live on the streets now.""

President Joko Widodo told reporters evacuation and safety measures should be prioritized and called for more coordination between city administrations and the central government.

On his Twitter page, Widodo blamed delays in flood control infrastructure projects for the flooding. He said some projects have been delayed since 2017 due to land acquisition problems.

'Extreme weather' expected

Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan said authorities deployed hundreds of pumps to suck water from residential areas across the capital, which had allowed some people to return home.

""They want to return home immediately and start cleaning up their houses as soon as they are able to enter their houses as water recedes,"" Baswedan told reporters during a visit to a densely populated area in East Jakarta affected by the flood.

Residents waddled through murky water to see the governor while workers pumped water out of the area into a nearby river.

The mitigation agency said on its Twitter page that water levels have come down in a few affected areas, showing pictures of streets covered by mud and littered with debris.

Authorities however warned people to remain vigilant as ""extreme weather"" is expected to continue until Jan. 7.

Dwikorita Karnawati, head of the Meteorological, Climatological and Geophysics Agency (BMKG), told reporters separately that heavy rainfall may continue until mid February.

A flash flood triggered by the overflowing Mulak River in Lahat regency, South Sumatra destroyed a bridge connecting two regencies in the province on Monday morning.

Lahat Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD) head Marjono said Air Mulak Bridge was destroyed by floodwaters on Monday. Heavy rain occurring since Sunday evening triggered the deluge at 4:30 a.m. on Monday.

Apart from connecting two districts -- Mulak Sebingkai and Mulak Ulu -- within the regency, the bridge was also a part of the provincial road that connected Lahat and neighboring Muarenim regency. The incident isolated a number of villages in Lahat regency, South Sumatra, such as Lesung Batu, Airpur, Fajar Bulan and Mengkenang.

Floodwaters had also destroyed seven houses in Keban Agung village, while at least 10 other houses, a district office and a mosque were inundated.

“Our latest data on the incident showed no casualties inflicted by the incident. Meanwhile, communications were also cut off,” Marjono said.

Officials of the BPBD, the Indonesian Military, the National Police, the Health Agency and the Social Agency had been dispatched to the location to assist the affected residents. Meanwhile, the floodwaters had receded since Monday afternoon.

The South Sumatra provincial administration said it would use a Bailey bridge supplied by the Public Works and Housing Ministry to temporarily replace the destroyed one, in order to reach residents in the isolated villages.

“We have also installed some road signs [regarding the collapsed bridge] in some places leading to the bridge,” South Sumatra public works agency head Darma Budhi said.

Sumatra VIII river basin management head Birendraja said the flash flood occurred because the river basin around the area had been damaged and could not hold the large volume of water flowing from upstream.

He added that the flood occurred almost at the same time as landslides that were triggered by prolonged heavy rain.

Earlier in the same week, a flash flood also hit Labuhan Batu regency in North Sumatra, damaging two villages.

Last month, the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency warned people that extreme weather in November and December would cause more hydrometeorological disasters.

The West Java administration declared an emergency status on Friday after floods and landslides hit several areas in the province, as well as in Jakarta and Banten, since New Year’s Eve, killing more than 30 people and displacing more than 170,000.

In Gubernatorial Regulation No. 362/KEP.13-BPBD/2020, Governor Ridwan Kamil said the emergency status would remain in effect until Jan. 7.

The province spokesperson, Hermansyah, said that the emergency status aimed to speed up the mitigation of the disasters in several areas of the province.

“[With the emergency status] rescuing and relocating the victims can be done quickly and precisely. We must also provide them with basic needs such as food, clothing, health services, clean water, sanitation, shelter and psychosocial services,” Hermansyah said in Bandung on Friday.

Recently, the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) issued a warning about extreme weather in the first weeks of January that would hit several areas in Indonesia, including West Java.

The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) reported that death toll due to floods and landslides in West Java, Jakarta and Banten climbed to 53 on Saturday morning, 30 of which were in West Java.

Bogor regency recorded most casualties in the province with 16 people, while another nine died in Bekasi municipality.

“We hope people in West Java increase their awareness of the natural disasters that can occur at any time. This is important to reduce the number of victims and amount of damage,” Hermansyah added.

On his official Instagram account, @ridwankamil, Ridwan said the administration is trying to complete the Ciawi dam and Sukamahi dam to reduce the potential for floods in Jakarta, Bogor, Depok and Bekasi.

Ridwan said the two dams was 45 percent built. The construction was being undertaken by the Public Works and Public Housing Ministry using state money.

Ridwan said the Sukamahi Dam in Bogor, for example, would be able to reduce flooding. The dam cost Rp 464.93 billion and the reservoir would inundate a maximum of 10 hectares.

“The progress has reached 45 percent. Land acquisition has reached 90 percent. Please pray so it can be finished immediately and all of us can enjoy its benefits,” he said.

18,18,FL-2019-000182-IDN,Jakarta is flooding and its governor is sinking - The Interpreter,https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/jakarta-flooding-and-its-governor-sinking,"Jakarta welcomed the new year with a new record — the heaviest rains in decades. The deluge left parts of the Indonesian capital under 5 metres of water, which triggered landslides and cut off whole neighbourhoods. Before the water finally receded this week, at least 60 people were dead and hundreds of thousands forced from their homes.

Jakarta is sinking quickly. Experts say that by 2050, North Jakarta will be nearly entirely undersea. Paired with unusually heavy rain, such as that over the New Year’s holiday, overflow of the city’s littered Ciliwung River and canals inundates homes and roadways, bringing Southeast Asia’s biggest city to a wet halt.

Experts have nearly unanimously recommended that intense flood mitigation programs be rolled out immediately, as disastrous flooding becomes the “new normal” for the city.

All of this is a political problem for Governor Anies Baswedan. After rising to power in 2017 from one of the most divisive elections seen in the region in years, Anies’ honeymoon period was short-lived, if it existed at all. Supporters of ousted predecessor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama have been unwilling to give Anies the benefit of the doubt and chalk up most policy and program wins, accurately or not, to the previous administration.

As the reality of governing sets in, Anies is also losing love among previous supporters. Despite a campaign built around ending the highly unpopular Ahok-era policy of forced evictions of Jakarta’s makeshift community settlements, reports of evictions have begun. In November, dozens of residents in a canal-side community in Tanjung Priok, North Jakarta, were abandoned after the city tore down housing structures.

The city’s response – that roads and waterways must be cleared and that residents had been offered subsidised low-cost housing – is strikingly similar to the previous administration’s policy. And for evicted residents, it’s a slap in the face to their support. “We were Anies’ voters – why are we being evicted? He said there would be no eviction under his administration,” one resident told reporters.

His worries will soon escalate, with Public Works and Housing Minister Basuki Hadimuljono wading into the flooding issue. Experts have nearly unanimously recommended that intense flood mitigation programs be rolled out immediately, as disastrous flooding becomes the “new normal” for the city. How that will look will depend on whether the Minister or the Governor are triumphant. Either way, Anies will face a heavy political hit, with further evictions along the Ciliwung River likely needed.

Anies is advocating a naturalisation project which would see land around the river, which snakes through the west of the capital into West Java, morphed into green spaces, and concrete flood barriers replaced with natural rocks. This certainly sounds pleasant, but it won’t happen quickly enough to provide flood relief, nor will it be easy to maintain.

The naturalisation plan is the inevitable progression of the “aesthetics first” infrastructure development seen under the Anies administration. Largely, it has worked well — the infamously inhospitable Jalan Sudirman is now both safe and pleasant to walk, for instance — but the removal of coverings on pedestrian overpasses, an effort to provide better scenery, has received mixed reviews.

Instagram-crazed Jakartans have taken to the new settings with gusto, but regular pedestrians are less impressed. Speaking to the Jakarta Post, Alfred Sitorus, head of community group the Pedestrian Coalition, said accessibility had been ditched for looks. “The city should first make sure that people with disabilities, children, and the elderly will be able to enjoy them too. Otherwise, it will be a case of wasting money on unnecessary things,” he told the newspaper.

Mass flooding and infrastructure shortcomings in the megacity will persist even if the plan to construct a new capital in Kalimantan comes to fruition. President Jokowi, whose tenure as Jakarta Governor oversaw the 2013 flooding event which left 47 Jakarta residents dead, is counting on the project to define his legacy.

While the plan has garnered global headlines as the first “climate change–related capital move,” a feasibility study was only commissioned after the announcement. Still, Jokowi should expect little resistance from the parliament when the plan is finally voted on this year.

Where this leaves the millions who call Jakarta home is hard to say. Infrastructure projects have historically been slow-moving and incomplete, but recent programs have shown Jakarta’s ability to move quickly and safely when need be. The monsoon season doesn’t finish until mid-March, and the city will likely experience smaller-scale flooding affecting traffic until then.","Fri, 10 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/GettyImages-1191300992%20copy.jpg,"['anies', 'river', 'jakarta', 'flood', 'capital', 'quickly', 'sinking', 'governor', 'flooding', 'city', 'residents', 'plan']",

He called on Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto to handle health-related issues and Social Affairs Minister Juliari Batubara to handle issues over social aid. Jokowi also asked State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Minister Erick Thohir to oversee the management of aid by SOEs.

""Even though I have seen their actions, I need to remind them about this again,” Jokowi said.

As of Monday afternoon, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) recorded that the death toll had increased to 67 casualties, with 36,419 residents taking refuge in shelters away from their homes.

The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) previously issued a warning about possible heavy downpours until early February.

Addressing the warning, Jokowi ordered the Home Ministry to encourage all regional leaders to be alert and better prepare for potential disasters that might occur during the rainy season.

Jokowi also made a similar order to the Indonesian Military, the National Police, the BNPB and the National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas), instructing them to be prepared for rescue efforts and to provide an immediate response to victims should disaster strike again.

“I believe I don’t have to repeat the order again,” he said.

According to the BMKG, the severe flooding in Jakarta and its satellite cities was largely triggered by the heaviest rainfall in the city’s history in over a decade.

The agency recorded rainfall intensity of 377 millimeters per day at Halim Perdanakusuma Air Force Base in East Jakarta on New Year’s Eve. The previous heaviest rainfall in the city was in 2007, when rainfall intensity reached 340 mm per day.

Jakarta. Indonesians have flooded the social media accounts of Federation Internationale de l'Automobile, or FIA, with pleas to cancel their electric car race in the country's capital in June.

Jakartans, many of whom are still reeling from the effects of massive floods on New Year's Day that have so far killed 43 people and forced more than 400,000 people to evacuate, were angered that the city administration has allocated more than $100 million for the race, higher than its flood mitigation budget.

A petition to cancel the Formula E race at change.org has garnered more than 1,000 signatures since it was published on Friday.

""This event is nothing more than a political stage show that ignores the city's most crucial problems and should be canceled,"" Irawan Prasetyo, the petition's initiator, wrote in his plea.

Jakarta experienced its heaviest rainfall in more than 154 years on New Year's Day and the subsequent floods have put more than 50 percent of the city under water in the past three days.

The official death toll has now reached 43 and more than 400,000 people have been forced to leave their homes and take refuge in shelters or the homes of close relatives.

""This was not a natural disaster, but a disaster caused by the incompetence of the governor of Jakarta who cut the city's budget for flood management and abandoned the development of most of the city's anti-flood infrastructure,"" Irawan said.

Irawan said Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan might have cut the flood mitigation budget to make room for the race, which he described as a ""high-profile event that is certainly not needed or wanted by the people of Jakarta.""

Anies has flatly rejected the accusation.

""That's just not true. It's a fabrication. I don't think I need to [respond]. I don't want to make any comment,"" Anies said when visiting a flood shelter in Rawa Buaya, West Jakarta, on Friday.

Nevertheless, many on social media have appealed to the FIA to stop the race.

Dear @FIAFormulaE board, Jakarta is not ready to host #FormulaE . Jakarta had flood problem every year. And today, Jakarta is collapse due to overwhelming flood almost in every areas. Jakarta's governor reduce the flood handling project and allocate it on Formula E. @kurawa — #Kerjabersama (@budhartono) January 2, 2020

Dear @FIAFormulaE , Jakarta is grieving & mourning, thousands are homeless, the deceased and more people are dying now due to the big flood. This was ALSO caused by insufficient flood fund allocation that has been cut off and placed for the Formula E racing instead. Kindly noted. — Superman Is Alive (@thomas7suherman) January 3, 2020

Flood Mitigation Budget Slashed

Jakarta's regional budget data showed the city administration has been reducing its flood mitigation budget since Anies took office in 2017.

The city's flood handling and control budget was Rp 2 trillion ($144 million) in 2018 before it was cut by 12.5 percent to Rp 1.75 trillion last year. Since then Anies has cut the budget again to Rp 1.48 trillion for 2020.

The governor, however, has allocated a budget of Rp 1.6 trillion to host the Formula E race to help promote the use of electric vehicles in Jakarta, one of the most polluted cities in the world.

Jhonny Simanjuntak, a city council member from the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) – an opposition party to Anies in the 2017 gubernatorial election – said the governor has made little progress in flood mitigation as a result of neglecting projects to increase the water capacity of 13 of Jakarta's major rivers.

""The development of an artificial channel connecting the Ciliwung River and the BKT [The Eastern Flood Canal], reservoirs and sea walls to prevent beach abrasion has not progressed,"" he said.

Mohammad Arifin, another council member from the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) –a supporter of Anies in the 2017 election – agreed with Jhonny's assessment. ""The Jakarta government needs to normalize [the capacity] of the city's water reservoirs, preventing them from silting and narrowing,"" he said.","Fri, 03 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.beritasatu.com/cache/jakartaglobe/640x441-4/2019/09/1568990152.jpg,"['anies', 'cut', 'jakarta', 'formula', 'flood', 'race', 'spends', 'preventing', 'governor', 'floods', 'budget', 'mitigation', 'citys']",

Tens of thousands of revelers in Jakarta were soaked by torrential rains as they waited for New Year's Eve fireworks.



National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said Wednesday that monsoon rains and rising rivers submerged at least 90 neighborhoods and triggered a landslide in Depok, a city on the outskirts of Jakarta.



Wibowo said the dead included a 16-year-old high school student who was electrocuted while more than 19,000 people were in temporary shelters after floodwaters reached up to 3 meters (10 feet) in several places.



Jakarta Gov. Anies Baswedan told reporters after conducting an aerial survey over the flooded city that as much as 370 millimeters (14.5 inches) of rainfall — more than three times the average amount — was recorded in Jakarta and West Java's hilly areas during the New Year's Eve, resulting in the Ciliwung and Cisadane rivers overflowing.



He said about 120,000 rescuers had been deployed to evacuate those affected and install mobile water pumps as more downpours were forecast in coming days. Authorities warned flooding was possible until April, when the rainy season ends.



He vowed his city administration would complete projects on the two rivers, including a dam and a sluice, to prevent flooding.



Television footage and photos released by the agency showed dozens of cars floating in muddy waters while soldiers and rescuers in rubber boats were struggling to evacuate children and the elderly who were holding out on the roofs of their squalid houses.

The floods inundated thousands of homes and buildings in poor and wealthy districts alike, forcing authorities to cut off electricity and water supplies and paralyzing transport networks, Wibowo said.



Director General of Civil Aviation Polana Pramesti said the floods also submerged the runway at Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusumah domestic airport, prompting authorities to close it and stranding some 19,000 passengers.



Flooding also highlighted Indonesia's infrastructure problems as it tries to attract foreign investment.



Jakarta is home to 10 million people, or 30 million including those in its greater metropolitan area. It is prone to earthquakes and flooding and is rapidly sinking due to uncontrolled extraction of ground water. Congestion is also estimated to cost the economy $6.5 billion a year.

24,24,FL-2019-000182-IDN,Jakarta governor's 2024 presidential hopes hit by deadly floods - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Jakarta-governor-s-2024-presidential-hopes-hit-by-deadly-floods,"JAKARTA -- The governor of Jakarta's chances of succeeding Joko Widodo as Indonesia's next president have been hit by his handling of floods that have killed dozens in the capital.

Anies Baswedan, education minister in Widodo's first cabinet in 2014, enjoys strong support from Muslim hard-liners who are looking to back him in the 2024 presidential race.

But the broader public may be dissuaded from supporting him after seeing the floods that displaced tens of thousands of people. Some residents are preparing a class-action lawsuit against the governor, according to local media.

""To run [in the presidential election] is still very possible with supporters with Islamic background affiliated with the [Islam-based party] PKS,"" said Ray Rangkuti, a political professor at Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University in Jakarta. ""So far, his strategy for gaining popularity is segmented toward his existing supporters or the Islamic groups"" rather than the general public.

The death toll from the flood has risen to 67 as of Jan. 6, with more than 30,000 people displaced. Floods are common in Jakarta at this time of year, and are part of the reason for moving the national capital. Widodo has blamed the severity of the disaster on delays in flood control projects.

The public criticism of Baswedan stems from a reported cut in the provincial government's budget for flood management in 2019. Of the 850 billion rupiah ($61 million) initially allocated, only 350 billion had been disbursed by November, local media said. The remaining 500 billion was not used because of Jakarta's budget deficit.

Because of this, a plan to ""naturalize"" -- -- relocating residents and developing open green space near rivers -- 118 plots of land on riverbanks in the north of the city was postponed.

Baswedan has refuted the claims, saying the regional government has not made any decisions to cut the budget.

Nevertheless, the public remains outraged -- a mood exacerbated by Jakarta allocating 1.6 trillion rupiah to host Formula E electric car races in the city. Baswedan's comments that children are ""happy"" to play in the water during floods also angered many Jakarta residents.

""@FIAFormulaE, I would like to ask your conscience to cancel Jakarta as a host,"" said one angry Twitter user. ""The budget for being a host is taken from some posts that [are] far more important to Jakartans. @aniesbaswedan has no heart to cut flood control budget just for hosting the race.""

Some observers say that in his two years in office, Baswedan has only made meager progress on tackling Jakarta's issues such as chronic traffic jams, waste disposal and flooding mitigation. He came under attack from some Jakarta residents for constructing more sidewalks in the capital, creating worse traffic conditions, and environmentalist groups are angry about the cutting down of trees.

""Baswedan's main concern on beautifying Jakarta is very superficial and apparently disappointing to so many people,"" said Rangkuti of Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University. ""Instead of working on preventing floods, he was focusing more on building more sidewalks and decorating the crossing bridges.""

Baswedan came to power in 2017 when he won a controversial gubernatorial election. He defeated the incumbent Basuki Purnama, an ethnic Chinese and a Christian who was, before the election, accused of blaspheming the Islamic holy text of Quran and jailed for two years.

Widodo, himself, used the governorship of Jakarta as a steppingstone to winning the presidency in 2014.

Triggered by torrential rain on December 31, the floods have claimed 67 lives and forced tens of thousands to flee their homes. The floodwaters vary in height, ranging from 20cm to three metres.

The retail industry, which was anticipating brisk business during the holiday season, was hard hit by the floods. Indonesian Retail Merchants Association (APRINDO) estimated that retailers in Greater Jakarta have incurred losses amounting to more than one trillion rupiah (US$71.6 million).

APRINDO’s chairman Roy Mande was quoted by The Jakarta Post as saying that the disaster had forced around 400 retailers, including some 300 in Jakarta, to shutter their shops temporarily. The estimated losses, however, could be bigger because the total amount does not include losses faced by ten shopping malls and several traditional markets in the affected areas. Some shops remain closed at press time.

The Halim Perdanakusuma Airport in East Jakarta was also forced to shut down for a few hours due to the flooding, which made planes unable to take off and land. During the closure, flights were redirected to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Tangerang, Banten.

Hasiyanna Ashadi, managing director of Marintur Indonesia and head of the Association of the Indonesian Tours and Travel Agencies (ASITA) Jakarta chapter, said that the disaster disrupted the pickup process of tourists as the toll road linking Jakarta and Soekarno-Hatta International Airport was inundated by the floodwaters.

“Fortunately, January is a low (tourist) season in Jakarta,” she said.

Hasiyanna added that ASITA members had received enquiries on the situation from their European and Middle Eastern clients who had plans to visit this month. Though none cancelled, some have postponed their trips.

Emphasising that the floods did not hit the whole of Jakarta, Hasiyanna said tourists who were already in the city were able to proceed with tours as normal since the capital’s key destinations, such as the National Monument (Monas) complex and Dufan, were unaffected. However, it took a longer time to reach the sites due to traffic congestion caused by flooded roads.

For tourist sights that were closed, ASITA offered guests alternative destinations.

On the hotels front, the impact on business has had two extremes.

According to Hariyadi Sukamdani, chairman of the Indonesian Hotels and Restaurants Association (PHRI), hotels located in affected areas, such as Kemang in South Jakarta, suffered cancellations due to access issues. A clearer understanding of the business loss is unavailable now, as PHRI members have yet to provide a financial report.

On the other hand, hotels in unaffected zones have become safe havens for residents in the affected areas. In such properties, occupancy rates have risen by 20 to 30 per cent .

Government agencies are now tackling the recurring rainy season issue, with the Ministry of Public Works and Housing taking action to mend damaged dikes, enlarge ditches, clean out clogged drains, and widen the Cilalanang River which causes the flooding of Cipularang toll road.

Basuki Hadi Muljono, minister of Public Works and Public Housing, said two dams in Sukamahi and Cimahi, Bogor, are under construction and are expected to be completed this year.

Monsoon rains and rising rivers submerged a dozen districts in greater Jakarta and caused landslides in the Bogor and Depok districts on the city’s outskirts as well as in neighboring Lebak, where a dozen people were buried.

National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said the fatalities also included those who had drowned or been electrocuted since rivers broke their banks early Wednesday after torrential rains throughout New Year’s Eve. Three elderly people died of hypothermia.

It was the worst flooding since 2007, when 80 people were killed when Jakarta was inundated by monsoon rains for 10 days.

People rest at a temporary shelter in Jakarta, Indonesia, Jan. 3, 2020. Severe flooding in the capital as residents celebrated the new year has killed dozens of people and displaced hundreds of thousands more.

Poor parts of city hit hardest

Four days after the region of 30 million people was struck by flashfloods, waters have receded in many middle-class districts, but conditions remained grim in narrow riverside alleys where the city’s poor live.

At the peak of the flooding, about 397,000 people sought refuge in shelters across the greater metropolitan area as floodwaters reached up to 6 meters (19 feet) in some places, Wibowo said. Data released by his agency showed about 173,000 people were still unable to return home, mostly in the hardest-hit area of Bekasi.

More than 152,000 people remain crammed into 98 emergency shelters with sufficient supplies in Jakarta’s satellite city of Bekasi, where rivers burst their banks. Much of the city was still submerged in muddy waters up to 2 meters (6.5 feet) high, according to the agency.

Those returning to their homes found streets covered in mud and debris. Cars that had been parked in driveways were swept away, landing upside down in parks or piled up in narrow alleys. Sidewalks were strewn with sandals, pots and pans and old photographs. Authorities took advantage of the receding waters to clear away mud and remove piles of wet garbage from the streets.

Electricity was restored to tens of thousands of residences and businesses.

Jakarta’s Halim Perdanakusuma domestic airport reopened Thursday; its runway had been submerged.

Rain, flooding threat remains

The head of the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency Dwikorita Karnawati said more downpours were forecast for the capital in coming days and the potential for extreme rainfall will continue until next month across Indonesia.

The government Friday kicked off cloud seeding in an attempt to divert rain clouds from reaching greater Jakarta. Authorities warned that more flooding was possible until the rainy season ends in April.

The flooding has highlighted Indonesia’s infrastructure problems.

Jakarta is home to 10 million people, or 30 million including those in its greater metropolitan area. It is prone to earthquakes and flooding and is rapidly sinking because of uncontrolled extraction of ground water. Congestion is also estimated to cost the economy $6.5 billion a year.

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Severe flooding and landslides triggered by torrential rain in Indonesia's capital have killed 17 people and displaced tens of thousands, a disaster official said Thursday.

Monsoon rains and rising rivers submerged at least 169 neighborhoods in greater Jakarta and caused landslides in the Bogor and Depok districts on Jakarta's outskirts, National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said.

The floods inundated thousands of homes and buildings and forced authorities to cut off electricity and water and paralyzed transport networks, Wibowo said. He said more than 31,000 people were in temporary shelters after floodwaters reached as high as 2.5 meters (more than 8 feet) in places.

Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusumah domestic airport reopened Thursday after operations were suspended when flood water submerged its runway, said Muhammad Awaluddin, the president director of PT. Angkasa Pura II, the airport's operator. Nearly 20,000 passengers had been affected by the closure.

Residents of Bekasi on the Jakarta's outskirts waded through water up to their necks or floated on makeshift rafts carrying clothes and other salvaged possessions. Some scrambled onto roofs to await rescue from soldiers and emergency workers in rubber dinghies.

""The government is awful and the rescue effort is too slow,"" said Imas Narulita, who spent 36 hours on the second floor of her suburban house with her 6-month-old baby.

She said that she have a neighbor who is sick but no one has come to rescue him.

""In this modern time, no one should have died because of this,"" she said.

Social affairs minister Juliari Peter Batubara said the government dispatched medical teams and rubber rafts to the worst-hit areas, while rescuers in boats delivered instant noodles and rice to those who chose to stay on the upper floors of their homes.

The flooding has highlighted Indonesia's infrastructure problems.

Jakarta is home to 10 million people, or 30 million including those in its greater metropolitan area. It is prone to earthquakes and flooding and is rapidly sinking due to uncontrolled extraction of ground water. Congestion is also estimated to cost the economy $6.5 billion a year.

President Joko Widodo announced in August that the capital will move to a site in sparsely populated East Kalimantan province on Borneo island, known for rainforests and orangutans.

Widodo told reporters in Jakarta on Thursday that one of the causes of flooding is due to damage to the ecosystem and ecology in addition to many people who throw garbage into rivers.

He said that the government is working to mitigate and prevent flooding in regions across the country. Especially in Jakarta, the construction of West Java's Cimahi and Ciawi dams is expected to be completed by next year.

""Both the central and regional governments would work together to solve the problem,"" Widodo said.","Thu, 02 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://tnimage.s3.hicloud.net.tw/photos/2020/AP/20200102/7d538d7fc32c4e72856c245487659f30.jpg,"['force', 'jakarta', 'jan', 'thousands', 'capital', 'indonesia', '17', 'flooded', '2020', 'neighborhood', 'flee', 'flooding', 'floods', 'tanggerang', 'kill', 'residents']",

People are taking to social media to alert their neighbors and ask authorities for help, as the widespread flooding that hit Greater Jakarta on Jan. 1 has left people stranded on the upper floor and even the rooftop of their homes.

The residents of Villa Nusa Indah in Bogor, West Java, were trapped by floodwaters up to 3 meters high that inundated their homes on Wednesday morning, following the heavy downpour that began in the afternoon on New Year’s Eve.

Those in single-story houses were forced onto their rooftops, where they marked New Year's Day with limited food supplies and without a change of clothes.

Community unit (RT) head Subadri said that residents in Bojongkulur, Villa Nusa Indah, waited 12 hours before a search and rescue (SAR) team arrived to evacuate children and the elderly.

""Our area is located between the Bogor and Bekasi administrations, so evacuation always comes late,"" Subadri told The Jakarta Post on Thursday.

The team arrived at 8 p.m. on Wednesday, after the residents had waited half a day to be rescued, he said, and only after the residents had been able to reach the Regional Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD) in Bogor and ask for help.

Subadri, who oversees an RT covering 42 households, said the evacuation took about four hours because the team was equipped only with two rubber dinghies that could each carry two people in addition to the rescuers. As a result, many residents remained trapped in their homes and some were drenched in the rain that fell later that evening.

Although the floodwater had started to recede by Thursday morning, Subadri said that many residents were running out of food because their houses were filled with mud.

Bojongkulur resident Anto Simanjuntak shared a second-floor bedroom with 12 other family members as they waited for the water to recede.

""This is the worst flood I've ever experienced in the past 10 years. There was a similar flood in 2007, but it didn't get 3 meters high,"" he said.

Anto said that he and his family received no disaster relief aid on Wednesday, and that they were now relying on other relatives for food and spare clothing.

Villa Nusa Indah became a trending Twitter topic on Wednesday, when its residents posted pictures and videos of the area's flooding that drew the attention and sympathy of netizens. Some residents also shared their stories of being trapped in their homes while they asked for help in being evacuated.

Twitter user Rofik Rosyid (@rofikrasyid) uploaded a picture of flooded houses and submerged cars in Villa Nusa Indah.

Kenapa semua fokus ke Jakarta?

""Why is all the focus on Jakarta? Bekasi and Bogor are flooded as well, and not a single [SAR] officer has evacuated our family in Villa Nusa Indah [...] Help us Pak @ridwankamil,"" he wrote, tagging the official account of West Java Governor Ridwan Kamil.

Rofik's tweet had been retweeted more than 3,000 times by 3 p.m. on Thursday.

""Last night, after I turned on my phone and tweeted, thank God for everyone's help, we were given meals. Thank God, the water has now receded, so everyone's cleaning their houses,"" he told the Post.

Nita Oktaviani (@nittonitnot) of Depok, West Java, in replying to another tweet on Wednesday that asked for help, shared a picture of houses standing in up to 1.5 meters of water in Pondok Bahar Permai in Tangerang, Banten.

""This evening, the water reached as high as 1.5 meters inside the house, but no assistance has come. Many people need evacuation and supplies,"" she wrote in the caption.

Mbaaa di Pondok Bahar Permai juga. Malam ini ketinggian air mencapai 1.5 meter di dalam rumah tp belum ada bantuan datang. Banyak yg butuh evakuasi & logistik 😭 pic.twitter.com/mQ9sYlzY5T — nitto (@nittonitnot) January 1, 2020

While she was unable to help on her own, Nita said she was worried about her parents, who were trapped on the second floor of their house in the area and were running out of food as they waited to be evacuated.

Nita told the Post on Thuesday that the National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas) had asked for her parents' contact information, but she was unsure they would be evacuated soon, since their house was located at the very rear of the complex.

Basarnas spokesman Yusuf Latif said that the agency was experiencing difficulty reaching several areas in Bekasi and Tangerang, as the flooding had cut off access. He added that the agency was overwhelmed by many requests for evacuation, since it had only 13 teams available for deploying across Greater Jakarta on Wednesday.

Yusuf said 38 teams with two dinghies each were deployed on Thursday, including to hard-hit areas like Vila Nusa Indah, Pondok Bahar and Kemang Pratama.

""Another hindrance in the evacuation effort is that the rubber dinghies are sometimes torn by nails or gates in the water, so the team must return [to base] to collect new boats,"" he told the Post on Thursday, adding that the agency would later determine the best equipment for completing the evacuation.

Yusuf added that the agency had gathered data on those areas that were not evacuated on Wednesday. It had also made the teams' contact details public, so that affected residents could call them directly for help.","Thu, 02 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/01/02/2020_01_02_84253_1577943935._large.jpg,"['volume', 'nusa', 'flood', 'help', 'jakarta', 'evacuation', 'overwhelmed', 'access', 'water', 'villa', 'agency', 'agencies', 'relief', 'houses', 'stranded', 'victims', 'residents', 'indah']",

More than 740 neighborhoods in Greater Jakarta and 107 in Banten remain without power as of Friday noon after severe flooding since Wednesday.

Areas in Greater Jakarta without power include Cengkareng, Bandengan and Kebun Jeruk in West Jakarta and satellite cities Jasinga, Nanggung, Cibitung and Wanasari in West Java, state-owned electricity company PLN said in a statement on Friday.

Meanwhile, those in Banten are located in South Banten. Electricity has been restored in most neighborhoods in Cikokol, Teluk Naga and Serpong, which includes the BSD residential area.

“To speed up our efforts to restore power, we’ve brought in personnel from Central and East Java,” said PLN executive vice president for corporate communications I Made Suprateka.

Hundreds of substations distributing electricity to Greater Jakarta and Banten were shut off following the New Year’s flood out of safety concerns. However, PLN has been consistently reactivating stations and as of Friday noon, 96.9 percent of the 23,700 substations in Greater Jakarta and 99.2 percent of the 14,000 substations in Banten were operational.

“Before turning on the electricity in their homes, residents must be careful and ensure all electronic devices are clean and dry. Otherwise, this might cause electric shocks,” added Made.

The company also urged residents to exercise caution when using diesel generators out of similar concerns over electrocution.","Fri, 03 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/01/03/2020_01_03_84304_1578041341._large.jpg,"['neighborhoods', 'electricity', 'outages', 'jakarta', 'following', '740', 'residents', '107', 'massive', 'noon', 'power', 'substations', 'floods', 'greater', 'banten', 'west', 'pln']",

As the saying goes, “When the going gets tough, the tough get going”. We Indonesians put our own spin on it: “When the going gets tough, enjoy aja” (just enjoy!).

The recent floods in Greater Jakarta have certainly been hard on residents who have been displaced, lost their personal belongings and homes, and a tragedy for those who lost family members to the floods.

But instead of drowning in sorrow, people have also found ways to have fun. Disregarding the dangers of the disease- and dirt-laden waters, as well of the cobras and pythons coming up for air, the flooded areas became an instant swimming pool for kids.

Others used these instant ponds to fish. One video showed a man in red shorts diving into his water-logged terrace, sliding back and forth from one end of the terrace to the other, using his bare paunch as cu…

The Industry Ministry plans to replace the damaged capital of small and medium manufacturers (IKMs) affected by recent massive floods in Greater Jakarta.

""We can assure small IKMs whose machines were damaged by flooding that we will provide 100 percent replacement,"" said Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita in Jakarta on Monday.

He said small businesses were the ones most affected by the flooding as large industries usually had measures to anticipate and mitigate losses from natural disasters.

He also said that during the week he would assess some IKMs affected by the floods, which lasted for several days in some parts of the city.

Gati Wibawaningsih, the ministry’s director general for small and medium enterprises, told the press that the minister would inspect a tofu and tempeh manufacturing plant in Semanan, West Jakarta, and a furniture center in Pondok Bambu, East Jakarta, among other places, to assess the flood’s impact on the small industries.

""We allocated about Rp 4 billion (US$288,333) for national natural disaster aid for the year,"" she said, adding that the ministry and local industry agencies were still conducting research on the number of affected IKMs and their losses from the recent flood.

She went on to say that the amount of aid would depend on the suggestions of the manufacturers. However, as people were still focused on evacuating their families, the ministry had not yet received any reports.

“For some, it is not their first flood, so they are relatively calm,” Gati said. “We can proceed with the aid once they are ready to start production.”

According to 2018 ministry data, there are 4.49 million IKMs nationwide. Some IKM centers in West Java were recently affected by the flood, including convection centers in Tambora, rattan manufacturers in Grogol, West Jakarta, snack manufacterers in West Bandung and palm sugar IKMs in Cigudeg, Bogor.

The Retailers Association has estimated that retailers in Greater Jakarta lost more than Rp 1 trillion as shops ceased operation amid severe flooding.

The National Disaster Mitigation Agency reported that the death toll from floods and landslides in West Java, Jakarta and Banten had climbed to 60 as of Sunday and that 92,261 people had been relocated to shelters throughout Greater Jakarta as of Saturday night.","Mon, 06 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/01/01/2020_01_01_84218_1577883938._large.jpg,"['ministry', 'jakarta', 'help', 'flood', 'small', 'affected', 'floods', 'manufacturers', 'ikms', 'greater', 'west', 'industry']",

Massive floods that struck Jakarta and its peripheral areas have not only affected humans: Stories of pets left in chains or cages by their vacationing owners have broken internet users’ hearts.

Footage of the dramatic rescue of a chained dog from a heavy stream in Cinere, Bogor, West Java, was circulating online on Wednesday evening.

The post was taken from an Instagram story posted by a user with the handle @galaindiga and resposted on Twitter by Twitter user @nihaqus.

It shows a dog desperately trying to break free from his chain amid a heavy stream and rising floodwaters.

The Instagram user wrote that he had seen the flood approach his house in Cinere on Wednesday morning from Bogor and that it was something he had never witnessed in the past 18 years.



“From afar I saw my neighbor’s house tried hard to [withstand] the heavy current. And I just realized that the dog was chained to the house’s fence. Sadly, the dog’s owner was not at home. The only ones seeing this incident were me and the RW head,” he wrote in the caption, with reference to the community unit head.

He added that he had been afraid to rescue the dog as the current was so strong and he saw heavy objects such as cars and iron gates drift away with the stream.

“And also, I did not know how to handle the dog in this kind of situation,” he said.

Finally he contacted local firefighters who came to cut the dog’s chain with an axe. The dog was saved at last.

“Pak RW tried to shelter the dog, which was traumatized. Some locals came to feed it,” @galaindiga said.

Many residents have gone out of town for the year-end holiday that also coincided with a school break.

A story with a less fortunate dog was reported from Kelapa Gading in North Jakarta.

Twitter user @reammapu shared her mother’s Facebook post that tells the story of a rescue efforts for five dogs owned by their next door neighbor.

Status FB mamaku hari ini huhu sedih banget buat guguk guguk kecil ini. Buat teman teman yang punya anak anak bulu juga, semoga baik baik semua ya anak anaknya 😔🥺 pic.twitter.com/79POkSqsJt — Restya Mahara (@reammapu) January 1, 2020

“The beginning of 2020 started with a rescue mission for five dogs owned by my neighbors, who were on their New Year’s vacation. Since last night, their dogs were very noisy. I thought they were afraid of the thunderstorm. At around five in the morning I peeped into the house, and it turned out a dog had died and was floating,” Rena said in the post.

Rena, her son and other neighbors then broke into the house and evacuated the remaining four dogs, who were cold and shivering.

“Fortunately, the four other dogs could be rescued and immediately sheltered at another neighbor’s house that is not flooded,” Rena said.

An update of the Twitter post said the dog’s owner was a new resident unaware that the area was prone to flooding.

Rena later provided another update to inform readers that the remaining dogs were alright as the owners had returned on Wednesday. She added that the dead dog had been older and weaker than the other four.

Animal rights community Garda Satwa Foundation also took to Instagram, advising pet owners not to cage or chain pets when they leave the house.

At least five people went missing when a flash flood struck the villages of Pematang and Hatapang in Na IX-X district, North Labuhan Batu regency, North Sumatra, over the weekend.

Hundreds of villagers in Hatapang village were trapped in the area for an entire day as they waited out the disaster with no working means of communication. The strong current of the 2-meter-high flood swept away 19 houses and destroyed one bridge.

North Sumatra Disaster Mitigation Agency head Riadil Akhir Lubis said the flash flood either damaged or completely destroyed 36 houses, as well as a number of public facilities. No casualties were reported, though five members of a family in Pematang remain missing.

“As of today, we have yet to find the five missing people. They were presumably swept away along with their house by the flood,” Riadil told The Jakarta Post on Monday.

The five missing family members have been identified as homeowner Akbar Sipahutar and his wife Cahaya Nasution and their eldest daughter Reni Sipahutar and her two siblings.

Riadil said the search and rescue team, which also consisted of regional disaster mitigation agency personnel, were still actively looking for the missing individuals. The team searched in several nearby rivers, but the missing people were nowhere to be found, he added.

After much difficulty, the team eventually managed to enter Hatapang village to rescue trapped residents, Riadil said. It had no other choice but to walk for an entire day to reach the village because roads were inaccessible as a result of the disaster, he added.

“The team entered Hatapang village on Sunday at 5 p.m. The flood has laid to waste every public facility in the village,” Riadil said.

He said the flash flood occurred after two rivers in the area, Lubuk Natika and Siria-ria, overflowed due to heavy rain over the past few days.

Members of the Indonesian Military (TNI) and the National Police assisted in the search and rescue efforts by setting up emergency disaster shelters and posts for victims of the flood. Villagers had since taken refuge in the designated areas to avoid falling victim to any subsequent flooding given the constant rain, Riadil said.

North Labuhan Batu Regent Khairuddin Syah, who himself nearly fell into a river on his journey to Pematang village alongside search and rescue personnel, said he would immediately send help to victims of the disaster.

Jhon Ferry, the head of Na IX-X district, said the flood also affected Batu Tunggal village, in addition to Pematang and Hatapang.

“Hatapang village experienced the worst of the flood. There were so many houses and public facilities that were destroyed in the village,” Jhon said.

The disaster is the second of major flood to occur toward the end of the year.

Two died and 50 houses were left covered in mud after a flash flood hit several villages in Kulawi subdistrict in Sigi regency, Central Sulawesi, on Dec. 14.

The flood in Sigi came as a result of a landslide from a mountain in Bolapapu, a village in Kulawi located next to forests. Heavy rain for days caused the landslide, which directly hit the village.

The disaster killed a father and his daughter who were stuck in their house when it hit. The mother of the family was able to survive as she was not in the house.

41,41,FL-2019-000182-IDN,Six common diseases to watch out for during floods - Jakarta Post,https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2020/01/02/six-common-diseases-to-watch-out-for-during-floods.html,"The torrential rains that caused massive floods in Greater Jakarta on New Year’s Eve may have subsided, but the rainy season is far from over, meaning more floods are likely.

Those affected by floods are at risk of getting infected with water-borne diseases contracted through direct contact with polluted waters. Floods also serve as a prime breeding site for mosquitoes, which also transmit many vector-borne diseases.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are six diseases or health problems in particular that are worth looking out for during floods:

1. Typhoid fever

Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection caused by Salmonella Typhi. Once the bacteria enters the body, it multiplies and spreads into the bloodstream, causing symptoms like prolonged fever, fatigue, headache, nausea, abdominal pain and constipation or diarrhea.

Typhoid fever can be life-threatening if untreated.

It is spread by eating food or drinking water contaminated with the feces of an infected person. Poor sanitation and poor hygiene during floods can increase the risk of typhoid outbreaks. According to WHO, a cyclone and flooding in Mauritius in 1980 led to an outbreak of typhoid fever.

Drinking clean water and adequate sanitation and hygiene among food handlers, alongside typhoid vaccinations, are all effective in preventing typhoid fever. Frequent handwashing also helps prevent the disease.

2. Cholera

Cholera is an acute infectious diarrhoeal disease caused by ingestion of bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The bacterium causes severe watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and even death within hours if left untreated.

Cholera is transmitted by eating food or drinking water contaminated with the bacterium. Lack of access to clean water and sanitation facilities, which commonly occurs during floods, can increase the transmission of the disease. In 1998, floods in West Bengal led to a large cholera epidemic.

Similar to typhoid fever, cholera can be prevented by drinking clean water and adequate sanitation.

3. Hepatitis A

Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by Hepatovirus A (HAV). The virus is transmitted through ingestion of water or food that is contaminated with the feces of an infected person or through direct contact with an infectious person.

Symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark-colored urine and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes).

Improved sanitation, food safety and immunization can prevent the disease. Personal hygiene practices such as regular hand-washing before meals and after going to the bathroom is also effective in combating hepatitis A.

Read also: At least 19 deaths reported as floods, landslides strike Greater Jakarta

4. Malaria

Malaria is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites. The parasites are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.

Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting and headaches. In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma or death.

Malaria epidemics after flooding are a well-known phenomenon, especially in malaria-endemic areas. According to data from WHO, in 1991 an earthquake and subsequent flooding in Costa Rica's Atlantic region and flooding in the Dominican Republic in 2004 led to malaria outbreaks.

The risk of disease can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites through the use of mosquito nets and insect repellents, or through mosquito control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water.

5. Dengue fever

Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by the dengue virus, which can lead to a severe flu-like illness, sometimes causing a potentially lethal complication called severe dengue. The virus is commonly transmitted through the bite of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.

The spread of the dengue virus results in viremia, which indicates a high level of the virus in the bloodstream. Severe dengue can be life-threatening within a few hours and often requires hospitalization.

The global rate of incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades. Severe dengue is a leading cause of serious illness and death among children and adults in some Asian and Latin American countries.

The most common symptom of dengue is fever with nausea, vomiting, rash and aches and pains in eyes, muscles, joints or bones.

Use of insect repellents is recommended to avoid mosquito bites.

6. Hypothermia

Since the start of the New Year’s Day floods in Jakarta on Tuesday, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) has reported three deaths caused by hypothermia.

Hypothermia is a medical emergency that occurs when the body loses heat faster than it can produce heat, causing a dangerously low body temperature (below 35 degrees Celsius).

Children and elderly people are more at risk of hypothermia during floods.

Symptoms depend on the severity of the hypothermia. In mild hypothermia, there is shivering and mental confusion. In moderate hypothermia, there is an increased risk of mental confusion, slurred speech and decreased reflexes when the shivering stops. In severe hypothermia, cold inflamed skin, hallucinations, a lack of reflexes, fixed dilated pupils, low blood pressure and paradoxical undressing, in which a person removes their clothing, can occur.

Appropriate clothing (dry and warm clothes) helps to prevent hypothermia.

Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan has implied that the majority of the capital was safe from the recent floods, claiming that floodwater only inundated 15 percent of Jakarta at the beginning of the year.

According to the city administration, the figure indicates that Jakarta is prepared to handle any future floods. The Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) had warned that heavy rainfall could last a week after hours-long downpours hit Jakarta and its satellite cities on New Year's Eve, causing severe floods.

“We have a total of 478 pumps spread across 176 locations, in addition to 122 mobile pumps. All pumps function well, Insya Allah [God willing],” he said as quoted by Antara news agency on Sunday.

“Therefore, Alhamdulillah [thank God] 85 percent of Jakarta is safe and only 15 percent was affected.""

Of the 15 percent, less than 1 percent was inundated by floods more than 1.5 meters in height, Anies said, concluding from this that “in terms of the system, Jakarta has prepared well"".

However, Anies acknowledged that the current number pumps owned by the city administration could not cope with extreme rainfall intensity.

“We are now preparing for short-term mitigation with the systems and facilities that are readily available, as the BMKG has warned of possible heavy rainfall in the upcoming weeks,” Anies said. “We would talk about long-term recovery afterward.”

Similarly, Jakarta Water Source Management Agency head Juaini Yusuf admitted some pumps at 10 locations submerged in floodwater on Jan. 1.

“We are considering elevating the height of the pumps in certain locations. There are 10 locations, according to reports from the field,” Juaini said on Monday, adding that the 10 locations were lowland areas.

The severe flooding that hit parts of Greater Jakarta and Lebak in Banten has claimed at least 67 lives – 16 from Jakarta – and affected over 500,000 people. About 14,535 people remained in shelters as of Tuesday at 6 a.m., according to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.

The ground in Tomang subdistrict in Grogol Petamburan, West Jakarta, was still wet on Thursday morning after a downpour the night before and even more torrential rain that started on New Year’s Eve.

Two classrooms at SD 11 Tomang state elementary school were packed with dozens of evacuees who had fled their homes after they became inundated by floodwaters of up to 1 meter in depth. Fortunately for them, the school was still on a year-end semester break.

Among the flood victims was Marni, who was sitting on the floor with her neighbors, most of whom were women, and their children. All they could do was talk to each other. There was nothing to eat and no fresh water to drink.

Insurance companies are expecting to see a moderate rise in property and vehicle insurance claims by next week following massive flooding in Greater Jakarta since Tuesday night.

Adira Insurance chief executive officer Julian Noor said most of the property claims would be filed by insurance policy holders a week after the initial disaster as they prioritized evacuating their families and belongings from their homes.

“There will definitely be a rise in insurance claims, but we still cannot predict how much as the flood is still happening,” he told The Jakarta Post over the phone on Thursday.

He added that the figure would depend on how many people expanded their insurance to cover flood risks as they were not included in most standard policies for both property and vehicle insurance.

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Severe flooding hit Indonesia's capital as residents were celebrating the New Year's, killing at least four people, displacing thousands and forcing the closure of a domestic airport.

Tens of thousands of revelers in Jakarta were soaked by torrential rains as they waited for New Year’s Eve fireworks.

National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said Wednesday that monsoon rains and rising rivers submerged at least 90 neighborhoods.

Wibowo said the dead included a 16-year-old high school student who was electrocuted while more than 19,000 people were in temporary shelters after floodwaters reached up to 3 meters (10 feet) in several places.

Television footage and photos released by the agency showed dozens of cars floating in muddy waters while soldiers and rescuers in rubber boats were struggling to evacuate children and the elderly who were holding out on the roofs of their squalid houses.

The floods inundated thousands of homes and buildings in poor and wealthy districts alike, forcing authorities to cut off electricity and water supplies and paralyzing transport networks, Wibowo said.

Director General of Civil Aviation Polana Pramesti said the floods also submerged the runway at Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusumah domestic airport, prompting authorities to close it and stranding some 19,000 passengers.

Flooding also highlighted Indonesia's infrastructure problems as it tries to attract foreign investment.

Jakarta is home to 10 million people, or 30 million including those in its greater metropolitan area. It is prone to earthquakes and flooding and is rapidly sinking due to uncontrolled extraction of ground water. Congestion is also estimated to cost the economy $6.5 billion a year.

Following severe flooding in the first week of the year, the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) expects floods and landslides to continue in the coming months.

BMKG head Dwikorita Karnawati said a climate anomaly that caused an extreme long dry season last year would not recur in 2020 but extreme rainfall was expected to peak in February to March, bringing more floods, landslides and hurricanes.

“While preparing for the peak of the rainy season, the function of reservoirs should be maximized to maintain water supply during the dry season,” Dwikorita said.

Greater Jakarta is not the only region in the country flooded during the new year’s celebrations, as some regions in West Java and Bengkulu were inundated by heavy rains that fell throughout Tuesday.

Heavy rain had inundated a section of the Cikampek-Palimanan (Cipali) toll road in Indramayu, West Java for the first time since it was opened in 2015.

Suyitno, the operational general manager of toll road operator PT Lintas Marga Sedaya, said the water came from a deluged field beside the road. “The water from a nearby inundated field has overflowed onto the toll road,” he said.

Suyitno added that the toll road’s drainage system had worked properly as it was only built to allow rainwater to flow off the surface of the road, but not deal with water from land around the toll road.

The 116-kilometer Cipali toll road runs through some forest areas, including ones owned by state forestry company Perhutani.

PT Lintas Marga Sedaya – a subsidiary of Astra Infra, the infrastructure arm of diversified business group PT Astra International – has been operating the Cipali toll road since its inauguration in June 2015.

“We have coordinated closely with relevant authorities, including the Public Works and Housing Ministry’s river and coast directorate, to solve the problem,” Suyitno said.

Passing vehicles were forced to slow down on the inundated section, while other drivers decided to stop. The water had receded since Tuesday evening, allowing the toll road to operate normally.

A flash flood also hit a residential complex in Cimareme village in West Bandung regency, West Java on Sunday afternoon, after an overflowing river broke a dike in the area.

“Heavy rain had caused the levee to break, which later inundated the houses,” West Java Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD) official Budi Budiman Wahyu said on Tuesday.

He added that the floodwaters reached 70 to 180 centimeters, deluging houses owned by at least 131 families in the residential complex. Some residents took shelter in nearby mosques.

Continuous heavy rain had also triggered flooding in Seluma regency, Bengkulu on Tuesday. The flood had deluged at least six villages consisting of hundreds of houses since 8 p.m, according to a statement from the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB).

Aside from houses, the flood had also cut off the road connecting Bengkulu city and Manna city.

BNPB spokesperson Agus Wibowo said Seluma Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD) personnel had rescued two residents dragged away by the water. The agency, however, had yet to issue an official estimation of the financial losses caused by the flood.

Personnel from the Seluma BPBD and the police were dispatched to assist the affected residents.

Days prior to New Year’s Eve, flash floods caused by continuous heavy rain had also hit regions in North Sumatra and South Sumatra.

According to the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG), there is a potential for extreme weather in most parts of the country for at least a week. Such a condition was triggered by several local and regional weather phenomena, including an Asian monsoon that increased the supply of wet air over Indonesia.

“We suggest people to stay alert to any potential hazards occurring during the extreme weather conditions, such as floods, landslides, strong winds, falling trees and slippery roads,” the BMKG’s deputy for meteorology, Mulyono R.

Operations at Halim Perdanakusuma Airport in East Jakarta resumed on Thursday after the airport was forced to close Wednesday morning on account of massive flooding in Greater Jakarta.

State-owned airport operator Angkasa Pura II said the runway was no longer inundated. Flooding had prevented planes from taking off and landing, forcing all flights to be moved to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Tangerang, Banten.

“We are very sorry for any inconveniences caused. The flight diversions went well,” said Angkasa Pura II president director M. Awaluddin in a statement on Thursday.

Police are looking into illegal logging as a possible factor contributing to heavy flooding that killed three people and left two missing in North Sumatra’s North Labuhan Batu regency.

The head of the special crimes unit at the North Sumatra Police, Sr. Comr. Rony Samtana, said a team of 10 officers had been dispatched for the investigation. However, he said he could not reveal more information about the mission.

“Right now, the team is working to investigate the alleged relationship between illegal logging and heavy flooding in North Labuhan Batu,” Rony said at the North Sumatra Police headquarters on Thursday. “Later, when we know more about the case, we will share the information.”

Floodwaters measuring 2 meters in depth swept away a family of five in Pematang village on Sunday morning, killing at least three of them and leaving the other two missing.

The latest casualty was a 7-year-old girl named Reni Sipahutar, who was found at the river near the hamlet of Bangun Sari on Thursday at around 5 p.m. The body was taken to Rantau Prapat Hospital in Labuhan Batu.

As one of the areas most hard-hit by flooding and landslides caused by heavy rain on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, Sukajaya district in Bogor regency, West Java, requires short-term fixes and long-term rehabilitation to repair the damage.

Heavy rains that lasted from Tuesday evening to Wednesday morning caused the Cidurian River to overflow, triggering landslides in at least seven different spots in Sukajaya district.

More than 4,000 Sukajaya residents have been displaced and more than 400 houses heavily damaged by floods and landslides, which also claimed at least six lives in the district.

An elementary school in Pasar Baru, Central Jakarta has allowed students affected by the recent floods not to wear school uniforms as school is set to resume on Monday.

“We have coordinated with the teachers so that children who do not have uniforms because of the floods are allowed to wear other clothes, as long as it's neat,” SD Pasar Baru 01 state elementary school principal Tri Astuti said on Sunday as quoted by Antara news agency. “It’s okay not to wear uniforms. I have told all [the teachers] not to send [students without uniform] home.”

She said the school would be ready to open on Monday despite being flooded from Wednesday to Friday, saying that the floodwater had receded and the school building had been cleaned.

Tri added that the school had also collected data on which students were affected by the floods, in the hope that they would quickly be given aid in the form of school supplies from the Education and Culture Ministry.

Minister Nadiem Makarim said in a statement on Friday that the ministry would provide school supplies and additional funds to schools, students and teachers affected by the flooding.

Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan said on Saturday that 211 schools had been affected by the flooding but 208 had since been cleaned, with only three schools still inundated.

Heavy downpours starting on Tuesday afternoon have caused the Air Ngalam River to breach its banks, flooding eight villages in Seluma regency, Bengkulu.

""So far, the data has shown that 182 houses were inundated and there were 685 victims. It’s possible the figures will change as our team collects more detailed data,"" BPBD Seluma secretary Basriyah said on Wednesday.

The eight affected villages were Tanjung Agung, Pagar Agung, Talang Tinggi, Lunjuk, Lubuk Lagan and Air Lata in Wes Seluma subdistrict; Talang Dantuk in Seluma subdistrict and Tumbuan in Lubuk Sandi subdistrict. Those affected included 13 toddlers, 28 elderly people and one pregnant woman.

Although no fatalities were recorded, the floods disrupted residents' activities, causing a four-hour traffic jam on the route from Bengkulu to South Bengkulu.

Victims who had taken shelter started returning to their homes as the waters began to recede at 9.30 p.m. BPBD Seluma has built a makeshift public kitchen and has distributed basic supplies to the evacuees.

""We've distributed clean water and lent out a pumping machine to take up well water at victims' houses. There hasn’t been any disruption in accessing their houses,"" Basriyah said.

But, despite the catastrophe in Southeast Asia's biggest city, authorities see no greater impetus for more cuts to planned carbon dioxide emission reductions or other measures to address climate change.

The floods ""should serve as a strong reminder to the government that things can't be business as usual,"" said Yuyun Harmono, a campaign manager at the Indonesian Forum for the Environment, the country's biggest green group.

With one of the world's longest coastlines Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country, is extremely vulnerable to climate change. The metropolitan region of the capital Jakarta is home to 30 million people and parts of the city near the coast are sinking just as sea levels are rising.

However, the country is the world's fifth-largest emitter of the greenhouse gases that are blamed for causing the climate crisis. It is also the world's top exporter of both thermal coal and palm oil, whose cultivation has reduced the amount of carbon dioxide absorbing forests.

At least 53 people were killed after the rains on New Year's Day, Indonesian authorities said on Saturday. Nearly 175,000 people remain evacuated from their homes.

Indonesia's meteorological department said it was the heaviest one-day rainfall since Dutch colonists began keeping records in 1866 and squarely blamed rising global temperatures.

""The impact of a one degree increase can be severe,"" Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of the agency, told a news conference on Friday. ""Among that is these floods.""

The floods were ""a big wake up call,"" said Hidayah Hamzah, a research analyst at the World Resources environmental group in Jakarta.

""WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT""

Social media users criticised the government for not doing enough on climate change after the flooding. Twitter user @wolfiecoconut said: ""Indonesia is a country that is prone to disaster but we don't care about the environment.""

But the green lobby has little sway in Indonesia.

Only 18% of Indonesians believe there is a link between human activity and climate change, according to a 2019 survey, the smallest percentage among the world's 23 biggest countries.

When asked if the government would do more on climate issues after the floods, the Ministry of the Environment and Forest's Climate Adaptation Director Sri Tantri Arundhati said on Friday there are no plans to change policy or shift the targets for cutting carbon dioxide output it agreed under the Paris Accord.

Rida Mulyana, director general for electricity at the energy ministry, said the government would stick to a plan for moving to renewables that means more than half of power generation will still rely on coal for the next decade.

Part of the government's solution for Jakarta's regular floods, which are not usually as bad as the recent ones, is to move the capital to the island of Borneo by 2023, a plan environmentalists fear will exacerbate deforestation.

Plans to improve Jakarta's flood defences include building two dams and works on the city's biggest river.

""There aren't a lot of people who realise the impact of climate change,"" said Nirwono Joga, a researcher at the Urban Studies Centre in Jakarta.

""When the flood recedes and people get back to their homes and resume normal activities, flood management or concrete actions to combat climate change will be forgotten too.""

Authorities have recovered the bodies of two people killed in a flashflood in North Sumatra’s North Labuhan Batu regency while three other members of the same family remain missing.

The victims, a mother and her son, were found in separate locations on Wednesday. Rescuers found 7-year-old Irul Sipahutar in Bilah River in North Utara district before locating his mother Cahaya Nasution, 27, two hours later in neighboring West Bilah district.

The two had been reported missing after they were washed away along with three other family members when the flood hit their house in Pematang village, NA IX-X district, early on Sunday morning.

Labuhan Batu Police chief Adj.Sr.Cmr. Agus Darojat said the bodies of the deceased had been unrecognizable when found by the rescue team. However, residents had helped identify the victims.

Their other family members, Cahaya’s husband Ahmad Albar Sipahutar, their daughter Reni Yana Sipahutar and their other son Reja Sipahutar, are feared to have been swept away in the same flashflood.



“Irul Sipahutar was found 30 kilometers from the flashflood location, while his mother was found 25 km away,” Agus said on Thursday, adding that the bodies had been taken to Rantau Prapat Hospital for an autopsy.

The flashflood also struck the neighboring village of Hatopang in the same regency. It lashed the two villages after the rivers of Lubuk Natiko River and Siria-ria overflowed due to heavy rain. The floodwaters also carried branches of trees and big rocks, causing disorder in the villages.

At least 36 houses and public facilities in the two villages have been severely damaged, and a bridge was cut off.

The local disaster mitigation office, along with police and Indonesian Military (TNI) personnel, have erected shelters for affected residents and deployed heavy equipment to the flood-stricken location.

Residents have taken shelter in safer places as authorities warned of possible further floods considering the high intensity of rain.

The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) has warned people in Banten and West Java to remain vigilant as heavy rainfall is expected to hit the area in the coming days.

Agency head Dwikorita Karnawati said heavy rainfall on Wednesday was forecast to occur in the west of Banten.

“Rainfall with high intensity on Jan. 8 is forecast to occur in the west of Banten. Banten still needs to remain alert,” she told reporters after a coordination meeting on flood-rescue efforts in Jakarta on Tuesday.

“[Heavy rain will also occur] in the center and west of Central Java, as well as in Gorontalo on Wednesday until Thursday.”

Meanwhile, rainfall with high intensity from Thursday until Friday is forecast to occur in West Java, especially in its central and western areas.

“Thus, the only expansion in the predicted area is the west of Banten,” she said, adding that the seas from West Sumatra to Lampung were likely to experience similar rainfall. “So please, everyone be prepared,” she said.

The agency also forecast that rainfall of moderate to heavy intensity could potentially occur throughout the country in the week ahead, namely in southern Sumatra, the whole of Java Island, Bali, almost all of East Nusa Tenggara and West Nusa Tenggara, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Maluku and Papua.

The severe flooding that hit Greater Jakarta and Banten has affected over 500,000 people and claimed 67 lives, 31 in West Java, 20 in Banten and 16 in Jakarta.

While floods are usually seen as an unwanted natural disaster, a village inundated with floodwater in Kampar regency, Riau, has instead become a destination for local tourists who are looking for a place to spend their year-end holiday.

Hundreds of people flocked to a flooded street in Buluh Cina village on Wednesday, with many of them bringing along their children to play in the floodwater.

Some children were seen swimming with pool floats, while others rented wooden motorboats to travel around the inundated village, kompas.com reported.

Farhan, a visitor from Pekanbaru, said he had already taken his children to the village twice this holiday season.

“I took them here to play in the water as well as to visit the fish market since they’re on a school holiday,” he said.

Since the flood currents were strong, Farhan said he always kept an eye on his children.

Rosmiati, another visitor, said she took her daughter to play in Buluh Cina almost every day since her own village was located nearby.

“I’m not really worried about letting her play around here, since I always watch over her,” she said, admitting that the currents were indeed strong due to rising water levels.

Local authorities have warned visitors to be cautious when playing in the floodwater, especially as water levels differ depending on the area, ranging from 50 centimeters to 1 meter in depth.

Security officers were seen standing guard in the area in case of emergency situations, such as drowning or being swept away by the water.

“Please always watch over your children, especially if they cannot swim, as we don’t want any casualties to occur here,” Buluh Cina village head-elect Azrianto advised visitors.

Kampar is one of six regencies in Riau that has been hit hard by floods this month, with the natural disaster affecting hundreds of villages and more than 25,000 households in the province.

The Riau provincial administration declared a state of emergency that will last for 11 days from Dec. 20 to Dec. 31.

Very few, if any, of the houses and vehicles ruined in the recent floods were insured. For those who can afford them, basic insurance policies do not cover risks from flood. Indonesians generally do not even trust insurers.

Indonesia’s insurance industry is struggling to achieve higher growth amid low awareness among people who are unable or reluctant to read between the policies’ lines. Those willing to insure their assets, lives and families turn to seemingly credible insurers. But that, again, does not guarantee assurance.

The shock of the fiasco suffered by state-owned insurance company Asuransi Jiwasraya has spread beyond its customers. The 160-year-old insurer failed to pay out holders of maturing policies under the JS Saving Plan, a product that integrates life insurance and investment. The policies that matured in December 2019 were worth Rp 12.4 trillion (US$891 million).

Jiwasraya’s mismanagement was blamed for the failure, which was first announced in October 2018 when matured policies reached Rp 802 billion in value. Jiwasraya recorded a loss of Rp 15.89 trillion in 2018 and Rp 13.74 trillion during the first nine months of 2019.

The Attorney General’s Office (AGO) announced on Wednesday that its corruption investigation into Jiwasraya found “indications of legal violations”. Despite travel bans on 10 unidentified individuals at Jiwasraya and 98 witnesses and 13 mutual fund managers questioned, no suspects have been announced. The Supreme Audit Agency (BPK) estimates that state losses from Jiwasraya’s bad investments exceed Rp 10 trillion.

We appreciate the AGO’s initiative to launch the investigation to shed light on the insurer’s vague investments and financial management. However, the public, mainly customers, will wait for the government to realize its commitment to ensuring full payouts to Jiwasraya customers as it has decided against granting the insurer a bailout. This is important to restore public trust in the industry.

To ensure customers receive their payout, the government is weighing several options. These include establishing an insurance holding company to provide a cash flow for the disbursement and selling parts of Jiwasraya’s low-performing stock portfolio.

Whatever the decision, the customers’ rights must be priority. The government should provide a clear timeline for the planned payouts for public supervision.

Furthermore, a supervision overhaul is needed in the State-Owned Enterprises Ministry and the Financial Services Authority (OJK), which supervises the financial industry, including insurance companies.

Jiwasraya’s problems had been known since 2006, yet strangely, no stern actions were taken by the government as its shareholder.

Without public trust, the life insurance sector will find it hard to attract more customers, which stood at barely 60 million in mid-2019. The government and the OJK must strengthen their supervision and management of the financial sector. No country can achieve stable growth and resilience without a clean, strong and inclusive financial industry.","Thu, 09 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2018/11/06/2018_11_06_58010_1541490936._large.jpg,"['rp', 'trust', 'public', 'insured', 'customers', 'jiwasraya', 'policies', 'insurance', 'financial', 'trillion', 'industry', 'assured']", 
61,61,FL-2019-000182-IDN,Jakarta picks up the pieces as flood waters recede - The Straits Times,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/jakarta-picks-up-the-pieces-as-flood-waters-recede,"Rawa Jati Sector 7 was a bustling area of Jakarta three days ago. Now, it is a ghost town, devastated by floods that have wrecked its power supply, poisoned drinking water and driven frightened residents to evacuation centres.

Four shelters to accommodate about 1,300 people have been set up in a government storage house, space under a nearby flyover, a sports hall and a community clinic.

Space is so tight that the kitchens have to be cleared at night to make way for sleeping residents, said Ms Sari Budi Handayan, a 40-year-old mother and an employee of an advertising agency.

Food is in short supply, with enough for only 200 evacuees a day. Many get help from the local government, while others are buying their own meals.

Mattresses are a luxury; most evacuees sleep on either carpets or thin mats. Some are in tents; there are no TVs and very few toilets.

While the receding waters are bringing some relief, they also highlight the huge cleanup job ahead.

Emergency response staff were seen clearing some access roads to make way for residents to return home to start cleaning and removing mud from their houses.

At one corner, a single bed was seen lying in the middle of an alley, along with pans and children's toys.

""We get floods every year, but not this big and not this early during the year,"" a mother in her 50s told The Straits Times.

She fears that worse is to come given that a series of small floods usually occurs in middle to late January, and become bigger in February.

""The water has receded, but we have a huge task of cleaning, and we need proper equipment to help us do it effectively,"" said Ms Sari, who is also the community group leader for Rawa Jati Sector 7.

She has been tasked with overseeing the four evacuation shelters, although she has her own worries: She and her two children have lost practically everything, including school books and most of their clothes. Most of their furniture was destroyed, and water was neck-high on the second floor.

Rawa Jati Sector 7 is one of many low-lying areas in greater Jakarta still reeling from the floods that forced around 400,000 residents to seek refuge in shelters similar to those Ms Sari oversees.

The number of evacuees has since fallen to 183,530, said the Indonesian authorities.

South Jakarta resident Ali Andri, 40, told ST that Wednesday's flood was the worst since more than 50 people died in 2007.

""The water came suddenly at dawn. The water was at waist-high level inside my house and chest-high on the street in front,"" said Mr Ali, adding that he managed only to move one of his two cars to higher ground on Wednesday morning.

All of his furniture was damaged, but the father of three salvaged most of the valuables.

Rescuers continued their search for missing people yesterday, with the death toll at 43.

About 50 volunteers were working at the Villa Nusa Indah residential complex in Bogor, West Java, clearing away mud and removing piles of garbage from access roads.

Mr Aulia Ibnu, a volunteer with Darussalam Peduli foundation, said some residents did not dare to enter their homes yet as mud left by the flood waters was knee-high.

In Poncol, South Jakarta, residents who live several metres from the Krukut River were undertaking their cleanup by throwing garbage into the river.

The damage and disruption in low-lying areas are in contrast with the situation in central Jakarta, which escaped the floods.

The main thoroughfares, Thamrin and Sudirman, saw a return of their regular rush-hour traffic jams yesterday after the New Year holiday.

But heavy rain is forecast to return over the next few days and more flooding is possible until the rainy season ends in April.

The government started seeding rain clouds with chemicals yesterday in a bid to avert this.

From trash-clearing and fixing damaged roads to preventive technical measures, the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway project is intensifying efforts to deal with extreme weather that has caused landslides and floods, especially across Java.

PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (KCIC), the business consortium in charge of building the national strategic project, said in on Tuesday that the company had identified risks surrounding the project area to take action against potential disruption and environment damage.

“The KCJB [Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway] project is currently preparing several anticipatory measures to face extreme weather,” KCIC president director Chandra Dwiputra said in the company’s official statement.

The measures include cleaning up trash that has clogged the Jambe River near the Kilometer 19 area and recovering damaged roads on the sidelines of the Cikampek toll road near the Jatiwaringin exit gate.

Apart from recovery measures, the contractors under the KCIC consortium, which include China’s Sinohydro, China Railway Group Limited (CREC) and state-owned builder Wika, swept through a number of landslide- and flood-prone areas, “monitoring river and water gates across project locations to ensure they function normally"", the statement read. ""The KCJB project also recovers public [road] access that was damaged by flooding.”

Extreme weather and heavy rain that hit Greater Jakarta, West Java and almost all other parts of Indonesia have affected infrastructure development projects across the country.

The US$6 billion Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway is to be integrated with four transit-oriented developments (TODs) along the railway line at Halim, Karawang, Walini and Tegaluar. However, areas along the railway are prone to disasters such as flooding and landslides.

The railway is expected to cut travel time between the two major cities of Indonesia to 45 minutes, compared with the normal three-hour train ride.

Monsoon rains and rising rivers submerged at least 182 neighbourhoods in greater Jakarta and caused landslides in the Bogor and Depok districts on the city’s outskirts as well as in neighbouring Lebak, which buried a dozen people.

National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said the fatalities also included those who had drowned or been electrocuted since rivers broke their banks Wednesday after extreme torrential rains throughout New Year’s Eve.

Three elderly people died of hypothermia.

It was the worst flooding since 2013 when 57 people were killed after Jakarta was inundated by monsoon rains.

Floodwaters started receded in some parts of the city on Thursday evening, enabling residents to return to their homes.

Wibowo said about 397,000 people sought refuge in shelters across the greater metropolitan area, as at their peak, floodwaters reached as high as 19 feet in places.

Those returning to their homes found streets covered in mud and debris.

Cars that had been parked in driveways were swept away, landing upside down in parks or piled up in narrow alleys.

Sidewalks were strewn with sandals, pots and pans and old photographs. Authorities took advantage of the receding waters to clear away mud and remove piles of wet garbage from the streets.

Electricity was restored to tens of thousands of residences and businesses.

Jakarta’s Halim Perdanakusuma domestic airport reopened Thursday after its runway was submerged.

Nearly 20,000 passengers had been affected by the closure.

Many residential areas are still submerged by standing water after massive flooding hit Greater Jakarta and Lebak, Banten, following heavy downpours of rain in the region from Tuesday afternoon to Wednesday morning, leaving at least 43 people dead.

Thousands of residents have fled to makeshift tents and evacuation points and are in need of immediate supplies including medicines, blankets, instant food, drinking water, tents or tarpaulins, pillows, diapers, flashlights and any other emergency items.

A number of parties from both the public and private sectors have come together to provide help and raise donations.

Central Jakarta resident Kadenza Tamara Indratmo, 25, bought ready-to-eat food for the evacuees on Thursday after independently fundraising for the flood victims through social media together with her coworker Pravithea Adhiatma.

A five-storey building in Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, collapsed on Monday, injuring at least eight people and leaving more trapped inside, local television stations reported.

It was not immediately clear whether anyone was killed in the accident or whether it was connected to flooding last week that left more than 60 people dead.

Tens of thousands in Jakarta were still unable to return to their waterlogged homes after some of the deadliest flooding in years hit the enormous capital region, home to about 30 million.



In neighbouring Lebak, where half a dozen people died, police and military personnel dropped boxes of instant noodles and other supplies into remote communities inaccessible by road after bridges were destroyed.



""It's tough to get supplies in there... and there are about a dozen places hit by landslides,"" Banten police chief Tomsi Tohir told AFP.



""That is why we're using helicopters although there aren't any landing spots.""



Local health centre chief Suripto, who goes by one name, said injured residents were flowing into his clinic.



""Some of them were wounded after they were swept away by floods and hit with wood and rocks,"" he said.



Around Jakarta, more than 170,000 people took refuge in shelters across the massive urban conglomeration after whole neighbourhoods were submerged.



Torrential rains that started on New Year's Eve unleashed flash floods and landslides.



Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency said on Saturday that two people were also killed after flash floods and landslides hit a village in North Sulawesi on Friday.



The agency said Saturday the total death toll had climbed to 60 with two people still missing.



""We've discovered more dead bodies,"" said National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo.



Jakarta shelters filled up with refugees, including infants, resting on thin mats as food and drinking water ran low.



Some had been reduced to using floodwater for cleaning.



""We're cleaning ourselves in a nearby church but the time has been limited since it uses an electric generator for power,"" said Trima Kanti, 39, from one refuge in Jakarta's western edges.



In hard-hit Bekasi, on the eastern outskirts of Jakarta, swamped streets were littered with debris and crushed cars lying on top of each other -- with waterline marks reaching as high as the second floors of buildings.



On Friday, the government said it would start cloud seeding to the west of the capital -- inducing rain using chemicals sprayed from planes -- in the hope of preventing more rain reaching the city region.



Water has receded in many areas and power was being restored in hundreds of districts.



The health ministry has said it had deployed some 11,000 health workers and soldiers to distribute medicine, disinfectant hygiene kits and food in a bid to stave off outbreaks of Hepatitis A, mosquito-borne Dengue fever and other illnesses, including infections linked to contact with dead animals.



Visiting hard-hit Lebak, Coordinating Human Development and Culture Minister Muhadjir Effendy said the government would help rebuild destroyed schools and construct temporary bridges, while offering assistance to victims.



""We're also asking for NGOs (non-governmental organisations) to help with trauma healing,"" Muhadjir told reporters on Saturday.



Around Jakarta, a family -- including a four- and nine-year-old -- died of suspected gas poisoning from a portable power generator, while an eight-year-old boy was killed in a landslide.



Others died from drowning or hypothermia, while one 16-year-old boy was electrocuted by a power line.



Jakarta is regularly hit by floods during the rainy season, which started in late November. But this weeks marked Jakarta's deadliest flooding since 2013 when dozens were killed after the city was inundated by monsoon rains.



Urban planning experts said the disaster was partly due to record rainfall.



But Jakarta's myriad infrastructure problems, including poor drainage and rampant overdevelopment, have worsened the situation, they said.



Indonesian President Joko Widodo has announced a plan to move the country's capital to Borneo island to take pressure off Jakarta, which suffers from some of the world's worst traffic jams and is fast sinking due to excessive groundwater extraction. - AFP

However, videos showing dozens of cars drifting in floodwater in Bekasi and people stuck on rooftops waiting for help proves just how serious the events were.

As flooding subsided, people started to collect their belongings, including cars. Some reported them missing, while others found them far from their neighborhood. Despite the heavy damage and poor exterior condition of their cars, car owners flocked to repair shops.

Sapta Klinik Mobil car repair shop in Jatiasih, South Bekasi was among repair shops with clientele lining up after the flooding.

“Pet owners who are affected by the floods who could not evacuate their pets with them, make sure your (bird, chicken, dog, or cat) are not tied or left locked in pet cages,” Garda Satwa Indonesia wrote on its latest Instagram post on Wednesday, January 1.

They also assert that the least a pet owner could do is to give their pets the chance to save themselves.

Garda Satwa, which was established since 2014, also announced that they are not able to reply to the many rescue requests from pet owners, which during the floods saw a sudden spike in pet rescue calls. This is due to the group’s animal shelters that were heavily affected by the constant rainfall from Tuesday to Wednesday.

Garda Satwa Foundation, on Instagram, called for pet owners not affected by the floods to temporarily provide shelter for those heavily affected by the floods. They said they are open to whoever is willing to do so and called people to contact them via direct message @gardasatwafoundation on Instagram.

The 2010s will end with the closing of 2019, and as we prepare to welcome the 2020s, many of us are reflecting on what has happened in Indonesia over the past 10 years.

The Jakarta Post has rounded up some of the most important events of the past decade as they appeared in our newspaper's headlines.

Here is part one of our decade in review: what made the news from 2010 to 2014.

2010

Mentawai tsunami: An earthquake-triggered tsunami swept through the Mentawai Islands in West Sumatra ─ one of Indonesia’s renowned surfing destinations ─ after a magnitude-7.2 quake jolted the area on Oct. 25.

The disaster, the biggest tidal waves since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, killed more than 400 people and damaged more than 25,000 houses.

Merapi eruptions: Mount Merapi spewed hot ash down its slopes on Oct. 26, forcing residents to flee to safety after the volcano recorded three major eruptions and was set at the highest alert level since Oct. 25.

Eruptions continued for weeks afterwards, affecting more than 300,000 people who took shelter in emergency tents. As of December, authorities recorded that the disaster has claimed 353 lives, including the volcano’s guardian Ki Surakso Hargo, better known as Mbah Maridjan.

Obama’s visit: Then United States president Barack Obama visited Indonesia for the first time in more than 40 years since he first came to the archipelago, where he spent four years of his childhood.

He was welcomed by then Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono with a state dinner on Nov. 9 at the State Palace where he was served with his favorite childhood dishes. “Terima kasih untuk bakso, nasi goreng, emping, krupuk. Semuanya enak!” he said.

2011

Ahmadi killings: A mob of some 1,500 people attacked a house in Cikeusik district of Banten used by the local Ahmadiyah community as a place of worship, on Feb. 6. Three Ahmadis were killed and five were seriously wounded in the attack.

The tragedy, in which the mob destroyed and burned a house and vehicles, is one of the most brutal violent attacks carried out by Muslim hard-liners against the minority group, which has been the target of persecution since 2005.

2011 SEA Games: The 26th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games officially opened on Nov. 11 with flair, flash and artistic glitter laden with culturally rich ceremonial performances following months of preparation marred by corruption and faulty coordination.

Palembang in South Sumatra and capital Jakarta shared the same place in Southeast Asian sporting history as co-hosts of the region’s biennial festival of sport. All was grand, glam and spectacular.

2012

Deadly plane crash: A Sukhoi Superjet 100 airliner on a demonstration tour in Indonesia went missing and crashed on Mount Salak in West Java on May 9. The accident killed all 45 people on board, namely 35 Indonesian passengers, two passengers from the United States and France and eight Russian crew members.

Sunni-Shiite mayhem: Two Shiite Muslims died of machete wounds sustained during religious violence involving Shia community members and an anti-Shia group on Aug. 26 in Sampang regency in Madura, East Java. At least four other Shiites were injured during the attack.

At the height of the violence, the mob also set alight dozens of houses belonging to minority Shiites in Sampang.

Followers of Tajul Muluk ─ the Shiite cleric sentenced to two years for blasphemy by the Sampang District Court in July ─ fled in panic after the attack on their settlement. Some 250 of the 500 members of the Shia community were relocated more than 8 kilometers from their village.

Jokowi-Ahok victory: Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and his Chinese-Christian running mate, Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, won in the Jakarta gubernatorial runoff against incumbent Fauzi Bowo on Sept. 20.

The pair clinched the majority of the votes on a generally smooth and peaceful election day despite weeks of negative campaigning, polarizing sentiments and racial insults since the first round of voting.

Sukarno-Hatta named heroes: Then president Yudhoyono bestowed the National Heroes title on Indonesia’s first president and vice president, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta, on Nov. 6 in what some considered a long-overdue recognition as it came 67 years after the country’s independence.

Detained at last: The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) detained on Dec. 3 the main suspect in a driving simulator procurement graft case, Insp. Gen. Djoko Susilo, who was also the first active police general to be locked up in a corruption case by the antigraft body.

The arrest came after months of tug-of-war between the National Police and the KPK, which saw a standoff between the two institutions that would end with criminal charges lodged against the KPK investigator in the case, then Comr. Novel Baswedan. Police later dropped the charges after Yudhoyono intervened on Oct. 8.

2013

Massive Jakarta flood: Areas in the capital were hit by heavy flooding after Jan. 15 as a result of days of heavy rain and waterways clogged with garbage. At least 41 people were killed, according to the Jakarta Disaster Mitigation Agency, most from electric shock, illness and being swept away by the floodwater.

Mount Sinabung rumbles: The Karo regency administration in North Sumatra declared an emergency response period because of the increasing frequency of eruptions of the province’s Mount Sinabung in November.

Sinabung spewed hot volcanic ash 3,000 meters into the air on Nov. 5, forcing at least 1,700 people whose houses were located close to the volcano’s crater to flee to safer ground.

Alleged wiretapping scandal: Relations between Indonesia and Australia took a nosedive on Nov. 18 with Jakarta recalling its envoy to Canberra over allegations that an Australian spy agency attempted to bug the phones of then president Yudhoyono and first lady Ani Yudhoyono.

2014

Deadly eruptions: The ongoing eruptions of Mount Sinabung in Karo regency had killed at least 14 people in North Sumatra. The fatalities added to the death of 21 evacuees who died from various ailments, such as breathing difficulties, depression and hypertension caused by the rumbling volcano.

Jokowi’s administration begins: Jokowi and running mate Jusuf Kalla were declared the winners of the 2014 presidential election on July 22, clinching victory against rival Prabowo Subianto and Hatta Rajasa.

Prabowo’s camp accused Jokowi of widespread electoral fraud and vowed to challenge the result. Jokowi won 53.15 percent of the national vote, as compared to Prabowo’s 46.85 percent.

Ahok’s rise to top Jakarta post: Jokowi’s former deputy governor, Ahok, was inaugurated as Jakarta’s 17th governor for the period of 2014 to 2017, becoming the first Chinese-Indonesian to serve as the capital city’s leader.

He was the second Christian governor to lead the predominantly Muslim city. Henk Ngantung, the first, held the office from 1964 to 1965.

Ill-fated flight: AirAsia flight QZ8501, en route to Singapore from Surabaya, was officially announced missing two and a half hours after it took off at 5:36 a.m on Dec. 28.

The plane was carrying 155 passengers, including 16 children and one infant, and had seven crew members on board. It was later confirmed that the plane crashed into the Java Sea, killing all 162 people ─ comprising Indonesian citizens and seven foreign nationals ─ on board.","Tue, 31 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2019/12/31/2019_12_31_84173_1577781724._large.jpg,"['national', 'jakarta', 'eruptions', 'nov', 'yudhoyono', 'oct', '2010', 'decade', 'killed', 'wrapping', 'mount', 'sumatra', 'president']",

Making people laugh in the face of disaster is certainly not an easy thing. But for members of Aku Badut Indonesia (I Am an Indonesian Clown) or ABI, it comes naturally after years of brushing up on their skills.

A member and cofounder, Ibnu Mahdiansyah, retold the tricks he used to entertain children at evacuation sites in Jakarta in the past week, after floods hit Greater Jakarta early this month.

A series of disasters struck various parts of the country during a period that is usually reserved for festivities and happiness.

While some might have enjoyed parties and celebrations on the eve of the new year, many had to face the catastrophic reality that came with heavy rainfall over Indonesia throughout the night and well into 2020.

Across the region, people faced heavy storms, floods and landslides.

More than 4,000 residents found themselves displaced and more than 400 houses were heavily damaged by disasters in Sukajaya district in Bogor regency, West Java.

The heavy toll of losses that came with the disasters is still on the rise, showing the Indonesian people the importance of sticking together.

The disasters are not over yet but, hopefully, Indonesians will rise together and become stronger after they have passed.

The outlaw gold miners’ activities, said ESDM, is believed to have contributed to the flash floods in six sub-districts within Lebak Regency’s 3,427 square-kilometer in Banten.

Head of the region’s energy and mineral resources, Eko Palmadi, said the illegal gold mine pits are currently being mapped by local officials along the national park area. The latest number suggests there are over 100 gold mines without permits.

“Based on our records, there are over 100 illegal gold mine pits in the TNGHS area. [the illegal mining] had operated for so long,” said Eko on Wednesday, January 8.

However, Eko asserts that the government and police mass-raided the outlaw gold miners in an attempt to put an end to the practice back in 2003. However, they were blocked by the national park locals who armed themselves with machetes.

Previously, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo said the flash floods in Lebak was mainly caused by forest encroachment and illegal gold mine activities. He urged the Regent to put an end to the practice.

Heavy monsoon rain in the Indonesian capital and nearby cities since New Year’s eve triggered likely the worst flooding in almost seven years, submerging homes and cars and shutting one of Jakarta’s airports.

More than 700 areas in greater Jakarta region suffered from power outages, according to state-run electricity company PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara. Commuter trains suspended some operations, said PT Kereta Commuter Indonesia.

The Jakarta provincial government is prioritizing the safety of residents and instructed schools and some offices to be prepared in providing shelter as the country’s weather agency expects rainfall to continue in the next three days.

The Halim Perdanakusuma airport had to shut as the runway was flooded and authorities diverted several flights to Soekarno-Hatta. Many roads in Jakarta were also not passable.

In January 2013, more than 30 million residents of Jakarta were affected by flooding that killed dozens of people and inundated areas including the central business district.

Indonesia’s weather agency, known as BMKG urged people to store important documents in a safe place and to prepare for power supply backup.

Ucanews.org reported the floods are considered among the worst to have hit the Indonesian capital and its suburbs since records began. According to the National Disaster Management Agency, at least 60 people have died because of floods and landslides in Jakarta, West Java and Banten provinces, while more than 90,000 people remain displaced.

Maria Lakaseru, Karina's emergency response coordinator, told ucanews.org Jan 5 that church workers have been distributing aid in 14 of the hardest-hit parishes in Jakarta Archdiocese and Bogor Diocese.

""Refugee service centers, public kitchens and health service centers have been established and are up and running in all these parishes,"" she said. In addition, Karina is providing food, clothes, boats and medicine.

Jesuit Father Christoforus Kristiono Puspo, director of the Daya Dharma Institute, the humanitarian agency of the Jakarta Archdiocese, said the main priority was meeting the needs of victims in shelters. He said his group had 55 volunteers working with local people in affected areas.

The priest said his team is supplying food to the parishes running public kitchens and providing clothes and blankets. It is also providing uniforms and study tools for students returning to school after the Christmas and New Year holidays.

Flood-hit Indonesia district needs ‘massive reforestation’

As one of the areas most hard-hit by flooding and landslides caused by heavy rain on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, Sukajaya district in Bogor regency, West Java, Indonesia requires short-term fixes and long-term rehabilitation to repair the damage.

Heavy rains that lasted from Tuesday evening to Wednesday morning last week caused the Cidurian River to overflow, triggering landslides in at least seven different spots in Sukajaya district.

More than 4,000 Sukajaya residents have been displaced and more than 400 houses heavily damaged by floods and landslides, which also claimed at least six lives in the district.

“From what I see, Sukajaya district has suffered very heavy damage, although it’s not as bad as Lebak, Banten, and [the damage] will need long-term resolution,” Coordinating Human Development and Culture Minister Muhadjir Effendy said on Saturday while on a visit to the area.

“There needs to be massive reforestation, particularly hard plants that have strong roots that can hold back landslides and absorb water.”

Muhadjir said that residents might even have to relocate, as it may be impossible to prevent landslides in certain areas.

“[Landslides] are a big national problem . . . and from what I see landslides are caused by our haphazard use of land,” he said. “This is very heavy damage, I hope that the Bogor regency administration will handle this area seriously.”

Muhadjir and National Disaster Mitigation Agency head Doni Monardo also gave 500 million rupiah ($36,000) in ready-to-use funds to Bogor deputy regent Iwan Setiawan for restoration.

Muhadjir also said that school activities should continue during the recovery.

“If there are schools that are affected [by the floods], we will build emergency schools. If not, the students should be provided with [education] services. The important thing, as I have said to the regent, is that education activities should not stop,” he said.

“Learning has to continue, whatever the conditions. If the schools cannot be opened, then [students] can learn elsewhere,” he continued. “If there are no teachers, I ask that others take over because education is a basic service that the state must provide, whatever the conditions.”

Access to Sukajaya district is also severely limited, as the landslides have blocked off many of the surrounding roads.

President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo had planned to visit the district via an Air Force helicopter with Indonesian Military commander Air Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto, Public Works and Housing Minister Basuki Hadimuljono and Doni on Sunday, but the visit was cancelled as poor weather conditions prevented the helicopter from landing.

“The president instructed us to exert efforts to open access to the isolated villages as soon as possible so that aid can be quickly distributed,” Doni said in a release from the Presidential Press Bureau.

According to information from the Public Works and Housing Ministry, six villages in Sukajaya district have been isolated by the landslides, namely the villages of Kiarasari, Kiara Pandak, Urug, Cisarua, Cileuksa and Pasir Madang.

Since Saturday, the ministry has sent 11 pieces of heavy equipment, including six excavators and one loader, to the district to help clear the roads.

“The method is that after one way into Sukajaya is clear, the equipment will immediately be sent to the next village while other vehicles will clean up in the rear,” Basuki said, adding that he hoped to clear all the roads by next week.

Besides Sukajaya, the flooding has affected 102 other districts across Greater Jakarta and Lebak, Banten, with at least 60 dead and more than 90,000 displaced as of Sunday.

JAKARTA: Heavy monsoon rain in the Indonesian capital and nearby cities since New Year’s eve triggered likely the worst flooding in almost seven years, submerging homes and cars, shutting one of Jakarta’s airports and leaving at least nine people dead.

A 16-year-old was electrocuted by a power line, while three more people died of hypothermia said Jakarta disaster management agency head Subejo.

""We're hoping that the floodwaters will recede, but if the rain keeps up it'll continue,"" said the official, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.

Among the victims was an elderly couple trapped inside their home in a district where floodwaters reached as high as four metres after a river burst its banks.

Another victim drowned while four people were killed after the Tuesday evening downpour triggered landslides in the city's outskirts.

More than 700 areas in the greater Jakarta region suffered from power outages, according to state-run electricity company PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara. Commuter trains suspended some operations, said PT Kereta Commuter Indonesia.

Ferocious blazes ripped through Australia’s eastern coast. Authorities predict it could take up to two months to control some fires.

Brendan O’Connor is the Rural Fire Service (RFS) captain in Balmoral, a suburb of Sydney. He described a recent fire as “hell on earth.”

“Everything was burning ­everywhere. We were so under-resourced. Additional resources couldn’t get to us, we were completely blocked off by fires all around.”

Tens of thousands of residents and tourists were scrambling for safety across the states of New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria in the largest evacuation mission the country has ever seen.

Months into an unprecedented wildfire crisis, at least 20 people have died, with dozens more missing.

Around 200 wildfires are raging across NSW and Victoria alone—and other states are also fighting fires. Some blazes are joining together to create terrifying infernos.

Steve Warrington, Victoria country fire authority chief officer, said that firefighters were unable to reach many of the worst-affected areas.

“We can’t even get fire trucks into some of these communities.

“This is not over by a long way,” he warned.

Destroyed

It’s estimated that 6 million hectares of land—an area nearly three times the size of Wales—have been burnt and at least 1,200 properties destroyed. Some entire small towns have been razed. Residents in the highest danger areas are being warned that ­authorities many not be able to help them if they don’t get out in time.

Rob Rogers, RFS deputy ­commissioner said, “If people choose to stay, then that is on them.”

“Do not expect there will be a fire truck if you ring, make sure that you understand that you are likely to be stuck there for some time and the last thing you should do is suddenly change your mind at the last minute,” he said.

Thousands of people are faced with rapidly dwindling food and water supplies while others have been forced to take shelter on beaches or areas already burnt out.

Entire towns have no access to drinking water, and tens of thousands of homes are left without power. There is bitter anger at prime minister Scott Morrison for his lack of action over climate change, his cuts to fire services—and the abandonment of those whose lives have been devastated by the fire.

In Jakarta at least 66 people died in widespread flooding across the capital.

Landslides

Extreme monsoon rains on New Year’s Eve caused rivers to break their banks leading to landslides on the outskirts of the capital.

A week later, thousands of people were still in overcrowded and dirty emergency shelters.

Soldiers and health workers are spraying disinfectant on the flood waters in an attempt to stop the spread of waterborne diseases.

In the worst-hit areas, residents could be seen wading through chest-high water or attempting to ­traverse dangerous rivers in inflatable dinghies.

At the height of the flood, water reached up to six metres and nearly 400,000 people were forced to flee and seek shelter in 270 emergency centres.

Yuyun Yuniarti is forced to stay at an emergency shelter at a sports centre. “My baby is not sleeping as the rain comes in, the wind comes in,” she said.

“It is disgusting here, but we are stuck.”

On Monday of this week, at least 35,500 people were unable to return home, with more extreme rainfall expected soon.

Why the crisis is getting worse now

The bushfires and flooding are a product of rapidly unfolding climate catastrophe.

Fires are more frequent, and more severe than ever before partly because of record-breaking high temperatures and long-standing drought across Australia.

Drought conditions—lasting years in some parts of Australia—are making it easier for the fires to spread.

Climate change is also making preventative measures more difficult to carry out.

Hotter and drier conditions mean fire authorities struggle to use controlled burning techniques that create a barrier between woodland and people’s homes and create breaks that can stop fires spreading.

Environmental damage is also the reason why Jakarta—a city and suburbs home to some 30 million people—is particularly prone to flooding.

Piped water reaches just 60 percent of the population, and the rivers are too polluted for domestic use.

So businesses and residents drill bore holes for water wells.

This has literally lowered the city’s foundations. Now, some parts of Jakarta are sinking by up to 20 centimetres a year.

The city, which sits on Indonesia’s largest island of Java, is also facing rising sea tides, choking pollution and unpredictable storms.

The horrors of Australia and Jakarta are caused by the same worldwide climate catastrophe—one caused by the industrial burning of coal, gas and oil.

But instead of cutting back on fossil fuel production, the Australian government has given the green light to a huge new coal mine in Queensland.

And the Indonesian government plans to relocate the capital to Borneo—leaving behind millions of people in a flooded city.

It can no longer be “business as usual” in a system that is careering us toward disaster.

New year, new strikes

School strikers are getting ready to make 2020 a year of climate resistance, and are planning to strike on 14 February and 13 March.

Coordinators the UK Schools Climate Network (UKSCN), said, “We need to make them as big as possible to send our message to the world and to the people in power that it’s been a year and we’ve not seen anywhere near enough action.”

And climate activists are already preparing for the United Nations Cop26 climate talks, due to take place in Glasgow this November.

83,83,FL-2019-000182-IDN,Can Indonesia lead? Maritime tensions with China escalate - The Interpreter,https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/can-indonesia-lead-maritime-tensions-china-escalate,"Sadly, for both Australia and Indonesia the New Year has wrought death and destruction with the worst flooding in Jakarta in a decade and an Australian bushfire crisis unprecedented in its scale and intensity. Given such calamities, regional maritime disputes are not at the forefront of most minds during this traditional holiday period. But the resurgence of tensions between Indonesia and China in the South China Sea is a development to monitor in 2020, for it has broader implications for Australia and its partners in the Indo-Pacific region.

After a relative hiatus in maritime clashes in the last three years, Jakarta lodged an official diplomatic protest to Beijing on 30 December in response to reported territorial violations by up to three China Coast Guard and approximately 63 fishing vessels in Indonesia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) around the Natuna island chain in late December. China Coast Guard vessels were pursued out of Indonesian waters by Indonesian Navy (TNI-AL) corvettes, but reports have indicated the Chinese vessels are still proximate to Indonesian waters and in no hurry to depart.

The Natuna Islands are located in Indonesia’s Riau Islands province, around 1,100 kilometres south of the Spratly Islands. They form the outermost land features of Indonesia’s South China Sea territories, from which its 200 nautical mile EEZ is drawn, and intersect with China’s nine-dash line claim. The waters have been the site of repeated clashes between Indonesian Naval and Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (KKP) ships with foreign fishing vessels, particularly from Vietnam and China. As a consequence, “Natuna”, as the collective land and water features in the area are referred to simply in Indonesia, are a source of both diplomatic contest and strategic vulnerability.

The sanctity of UNCLOS

For a nation acutely sensitive about its sovereignty, maritime jurisdictional violations and the plundering of fish stocks are a red-button issue for Indonesia. The treaty principles that underpin Indonesia’s legal status as an archipelagic state and which define its expansive maritime jurisdiction are considered almost sacrosanct in Indonesia’s foreign policy circles.

Indonesia is not without diplomatic leverage or military capability to deter China if it so chooses to apply it.

An initial statement from Indonesia’s Foreign Affairs Ministry (Kemlu) reiterated that “Indonesia did not have an overlapping jurisdictional claim with China” and that Indonesia “would never recognise China’s nine-dash line claim which contravenes both the … [United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea] … and the 2016 UNCLOS Tribunal Ruling.” It did, however, highlight Indonesia’s strategic partnership with China and the mutual commitment to the bilateral relationship.

An attempt by the Chinese foreign ministry to give added legitimacy to their claim only prompted an even stronger statement by Kemlu on 1 January, rejecting China’s assertion that “Chinese fishermen had long been active in these waters” as “a unilateral claim with no basis in international law”.

Imposing limits on China’s power

Indonesia’s response to China’s illegal conduct in the South China Sea has broader implications, not just because Indonesia is an increasingly powerful state both in the Southeast Asian subregion and beyond. This response is also important because any pushback by Indonesia against China in diplomatic and strategic terms benefits Australia and its key Indo-Pacific partners the US, Japan, India, Singapore, and Vietnam in imposing further limits on China’s power.

China faces a more formidable challenge testing Indonesia’s resolve on the South China Sea than it does in comparison to the Philippines, Malaysia, or even Vietnam. Home to Southeast Asia’s largest armed forces, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, and de facto leader of ASEAN, Indonesia is not without diplomatic leverage or military capability to deter China if it so chooses to apply it.

Cognisant of such leverage, a member of Indonesia’s parliamentary (DPR) committee (Komisi I) overseeing Defence and Foreign Affairs, Charles Honoris, suggested a number of “stronger options” may be needed in order to deter China. Honoris suggested that Indonesia could review both its bilateral and multilateral cooperation with China, including cooperation on the Belt Road Initiative (BRI) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, as well as join with fellow Southeast Asian states facing similar territorial challenges to review ASEAN’s trade and investment cooperation with China.

Domestic political response

It is interesting that Beijing has chosen to provoke Jakarta at this time. With presidential election schisms over, Jokowi has consolidated his power base in the DPR and appointed former opponents into key cabinet posts. Testing Indonesia on the defence of its maritime sovereignty with former general Prabowo Subianto as Defence Minister seems an injudicious move by China, reflecting perhaps a lack of broader understanding among Chinese officials on how old tropes about an “amorphous Chinese threat” can be manipulated by political elites.

Prabowo has long been seen as anti-Chinese, based on his human rights record and alleged links to anti-Chinese violence in 1998. A tough stance against China may be one way Prabowo could make his mark as Defence Minister, although his comments to date have been notably measured following a recent three day visit to China to discuss bilateral defence cooperation. In fact, Prabowo has attracted criticism for a perceived “soft” response on Natuna provocations.

Twisting the dragon’s tail

So, how hard will Indonesia twist the dragon’s tail? That depends on how far China provokes Indonesia on Natuna, of course. With a re-elected President in his final term freed to implement priority policy agendas and a new Defence Minister seeking to make his mark in the portfolio, there may be a greater inclination for a tougher line on China.

Although one would not expect dramatic responses, Indonesia has a range of options at its disposal to impose costs on China for ignoring international legal norms and challenging Indonesia’s territorial integrity. Emboldened by success in securing Southeast Asia’s support for the “ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific”, an Indonesian-led vision of an inclusive and ASEAN-centred Indo-Pacific order, Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi may also be less inclined to do Beijing any favours with respect to its priority regional multilateral initiatives, such as the BRI or the highly protracted China-ASEAN South China Sea Code of Conduct.

In the meantime, Indonesian Navy (TNI-AL) has launched “Operation Combat Alert Natuna Sea 2020”, including the deployment of up to six naval vessels, whilst the Air Force (TNI-AU) has deployed four of its F16 fighters. On 8 January, Jokowi travelled to Raden Sadjad Air Force Base on Natuna Besar to receive a briefing from Commander Joint Regional Defence Command I (Kogabwilhan I) Vice Admiral Yudo Margono. In addition, the government has requested hundreds of Indonesian fishing vessels enhance Indonesia’s presence in Natuna waters.

Continued assertiveness by Beijing could potentially further sour Indonesia-China relations, a relationship long characterised by ambiguity and distrust. It could also precipitate a harder line by key ASEAN states, led by Indonesia, with regard to South China Sea issues.

Ultimately, a tougher line by Indonesia aligns well with the strategic objectives of Australia and its Indo-Pacific partners, who seek limits to Beijing’s coercive power. The question remains to what extent the Indonesian government will exercise agency and leadership on this issue.","Thu, 09 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/GettyImages-594329982.jpg,"['vessels', 'indonesia', 'defence', 'escalate', 'indonesias', 'natuna', 'sea', 'lead', 'south', 'tensions', 'maritime', 'china', 'indonesian']",

Farah and her family were still inside.

Farah was the only survivor.

She was severely burned and spent a long time in the hospital. And when she felt well enough to leave the hospital, her journey was just beginning. She knew that in order to be safe, she would need to make the long journey that many before her have made (and many since). Farah made the long air, sea and land journey to Jakarta, Indonesia–as hundreds of children, teens and families have done in the past decades.

Once she made it to Jakarta, Farah lived in a Somalian community and felt a sense of peace. Unfortunately, the lingering effects of her burns and the stress of being in a new place on her own made her sick. With no money to afford a hospital visit, Farah’s only option was to bear the pain. Then another Somali refugee told her that she could register with the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, and explain her health situation. Farah was optimistic about getting help.

Soon after she registered, the UNHCR referred Farah to CWS to live in a group home that we host for single women and girls who are seeking asylum or who are refugees. The house is call ASPIRASI, or Aspiration. At first, living in a home with so many women and girls from all different backgrounds was a challenge. Her housemates were trying to be nice and ask her about herself, but Farah remembers, “I had to keep reliving my past, and everyone kept asking me about my burns.”

So at first, Farah was just glad to be safe. But as CWS social workers helped her adjust and receive the medical treatment she needed, she began to feel more at home. Eventually, a social worker suggested that Farah may want to take some classes. She signed up for quite a few of them: English, Indonesian, math, science, computers and sewing!

Today, Farah says she enjoys the classes. What she’s most grateful for, though, is to have a safe place to live and access to medical care and counseling. “I finally feel like I have a chance to improve myself,” she says. “While I still get anxious, I can better handle the questions and stares when I meet new people.”

Like all the asylum seekers and refugees living in CWS-supported group homes in Jakarta, Farah left her home country under duress and out of fear. And like her housemates, Farah hopes for a better life. The resilience and passion for a new life inspire our team in Jakarta every day. Through the Protecting Urban Refugees through Empowerment program, CWS supports activities and services, including counseling and basic health care, to help hundreds of people live lives of basic dignity and safety as they seek to sort out more positive and productive futures.","Fri, 03 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/rw-logo-social-media.png,"['farah', 'jakarta', 'journey', 'safety', 'women', 'young', 'indonesia', 'long', 'care', 'refugees', 'classes', 'live', 'safe', 'refugee', 'medical', 'hospital', 'cws']",

Monsoon rains and rising rivers submerged a dozen districts in the greater Jakarta area and caused landslides that buried at least a dozen people.

National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said the fatalities included those who had drowned or been electrocuted since rivers broke their banks early on Wednesday after extreme torrential rains hit on New Year’s Eve.

It is the worst flooding in the area since 2007, when 80 people were killed over 10 days.

Rescuers recovered more bodies as flash floods and mudslides destroyed Sukamulia village in Bogor district.

They were searching for a villager who was missing in a landslide in Lebak, a district in neighbouring Banten province, Mr Wibowo said.

The number of fatalities was expected to increase, with rescuers and villagers also searching for at least three people believed to be buried in another landslide in Cigudeg village in Bogor district, said Ridwan, the village’s secretary, who goes by a single name.

Ridwan said bad weather, blackouts and mudslides were hampering rescue efforts. He said rescuers on Saturday managed to reach eight hamlets that had been isolated for days by cut-off roads and mudslides and rescued more than 1,700 villagers in weak condition.

Four days after the region of 30 million people was struck by flash floods, waters have receded in many middle-class districts, but conditions remained grim in narrow riverside alleys where the city’s poor live.

Government data showed that some 173,000 people were still unable to return home and were crammed at damp emergency shelters, mostly in the hardest-hit area of Bekasi.

Much of the city was still submerged in muddy waters up to two metres high, according to the disaster agency.

Indonesia’s Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency said that more downpours were forecast for the capital in the coming days, and that the potential for extreme rainfall will continue until next month across the vast archipelago nation.

The government on Friday started cloud seeding in an attempt to divert rain clouds from reaching greater Jakarta to prevent possible flooding, the agency said.

Hopes were high for the new year.

But it started with tragedy in Indonesia, where flash floods in the country's capital, Jakarta, and nearby towns have killed 43 people and forced almost 400,000 to flee their homes.

Meanwhile, people were evacuated from New South Wales and Victoria amid the threat of Australia's ongoing wildfires.

Then, on Friday, US-Iran relations were plunged into a new crisis when President Donald Trump authorised a drone strike that killed Iranian military chief Qassem Soleimani.

The site of the new capital on the island of Borneo is home to 162 existing concessions, most of them for coal mining, according to a report from a coalition of NGOs. This contradicts the government’s claim that the city will be built on vacant land, and raises the prospect of the concession holders exploiting the opportunity for profit, said Merah Johansyah from the Mining Advocacy Network (Jatam), one of the NGOs in the coalition.

“If the government says it’s going to be the public who will benefit [from relocating the capital], that’s a big lie,” he said at the launch of the report in Jakarta. “The ones that will benefit are these companies.”

Among the companies with concessions at the site in East Kalimantan province, based on the coalition’s analysis of publicly available land and corporate registration records, are those affiliated to pulpwood and palm oil billionaire Sukanto Tanoto.

Among Tanoto’s many businesses is Asia Pacific Resources International Holdings (APRIL), Indonesia’s second-biggest pulp and paper company. An APRIL subsidiary, PT International Timber Corporation Indonesia Hutani Manunggal (ITCI HM), currently manages a pulpwood plantation at the site of the new capital that overlaps with a 5,644-hectare (13,950-acre) lot where the government plans to build its new office complex.

Sukanto took control of ICTI HM in 2006 from prominent businessman Hashim Djojohadikusumo, the brother of Prabowo Subianto, a two-time presidential candidate and current minister of defense.

Hashim still controls 173,400 ha (428,500 acres) of concessions in the same region through his own company, PT International Timber Corporation Indonesia Kartika Utama, representing an area larger than the city of Los Angeles. Those concessions overlap with much of the 42,000 ha (103,800 acres) that the government plans to allocate for residential zones in the new capital.

Other parts of the new capital, which still doesn’t have a name, sit on coal mining concessions held by three companies linked to Rheza Herwindo, the son of former parliamentary speaker and corruption convict Setya Novanto.

Luhut Pandjaitan, the senior minister in charge of investment and a close confidant of President Joko Widodo, has also been identified in the report as controlling a mining concession in the area through a subsidiary of his Toba Sejahtra conglomerate. Another Widodo ally named in the report is Yusril Ihza Mahendra, the lead counsel for the president’s 2019 re-election campaign chairman and chairman of a minor party that backed the incumbent.

Also on the list is palm oil billionaire Lim Hariyanto Wijaya Sarwono, who owns the Harita Group conglomerate.

“ If the government says it’s going to be the public who will benefit [from relocating the capital], that’s a big lie. The ones that will benefit are these companies. Merah Johansyah, coordinator, Mining Advocacy Network (Jatam)

Land swaps

With the permits for some of the concessions not set to expire for another 20 years, the businesses have the upper hand over the government when it comes to negotiating a settlement for relinquishing the land, according to Jatam’s Merah.

“Will these concession holders voluntarily give up their lands? Or will there be compensation?” he said. “What will the compensation be? Who will benefit from this? Who is this new capital for? It’s for these 162 concession [holders].”

In the case of a pulpwood company like ICTI HM, there’s the prospect of getting a new swath of land elsewhere as compensation — and potentially sparking new waves of deforestation in parts of Indonesia still relatively unscathed by the wholesale clearing of forests seen in Borneo and Sumatra.

“If we look at the trend of selective logging and pulpwood businesses, they’re shifting toward eastern parts of Indonesia, to Papua,” said Zenzi Suhadi of the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi). “There’s a likelihood that they will reduce the size of their concessions in East Kalimantan, and then they’re going to ask [for substitute lands] in Papua.”

Government officials have said there is no legal requirement to compensate either pulpwood or mining concession holders for relinquishing the land, except for property built on the land and trees not yet mature enough to be harvested. The forestry ministry says it may compensate pulpwood companies by connecting them with community-run plantations under the government’s social forestry programme, but activists say land swaps are more likely.

The mechanism for swaps was introduced in 2017 for pulpwood and logging companies that had to relinquish their concessions on peatlands in order to conserve and restore the land under a nationwide fire mitigation effort.

Coal boon

For coal companies, the prospect of token compensation may be offset by the anticipated surge in electricity demand — an estimated 1,555 megawatts, according to the government — that’s expected to be generated by burning more coal.

The government had initially planned to add 691 MW of capacity to East Kalimantan’s power grid by 2024. That leaves a further 864 MW still to be added, according to the ministry of mines and energy.

President Widodo previously said the new capital’s energy would come from renewables and wouldn’t depend on fossil fuels. But the government later announced that only 39 per cent of the new capital’s electricity would come from renewable sources, primarily hydropower.

That’s left activists worried that the bulk will have to come from coal-fired power plants — Indonesia’s go-to for new power generation. At least three coal plants are already planned for construction in East Kalimantan, which will benefit the industry, according to Yuyun Indradi, the executive director of the NGO Trend Asia.

The government has issued at least 1,434 mining permits in East Kalimantan, spanning more than 5 million ha (12 million acres) — an area larger than Belgium.

What makes it highly likely that coal will power the new capital is the tight time line for the project, Yuyun said; the government has said it will move to the new capital from Jakarta by 2024, and coal is the most plentiful and accessible energy source to bring online in such a short time.

“Coal has become the closest source [of energy] for the new capital,” Yuyun said. “When the new capital is predicted to need 1.5 gigawatts of electricity, the surrounding coal businesses will be more than happy to supply, or even build new coal plants to feed the new capital’s electricity demand.”

PT Bumi Resources, Indonesia’s largest thermal coal miner, is already eyeing a slice of the pie by planning to build coal plants in the region. The company also says it’s ready to provide energy for the new capital through its subsidiary, PT Kaltim Prima Coal, which operates a mine 260 kilometres (160 miles) from the site.

This prospect makes it impossible for the government to fulfill its promise of a pollution-free and zero-emission capital city, Yuyun said.

“So a smart city or a green city is just a dream, especially the zero-emission [promise], that’s highly impossible,” he said. “Because opening up new land itself already creates emissions, using cement [for construction] also creates emission.”

There’s also the question of what happens to the abandoned mining pits that companies have neglected to fill in and rehabilitate, as required by law. Luhut’s mining firms, for instance, have left 50 such pits behind. There are 94 of these pits at the site of the new capital, out of 630 across East Kalimantan, according to the NGO coalition. These pits fill up with rainwater over time, turning into deep pools that pose a drowning risk for locals, particularly children. The NGOs have recorded at least 36 people drowning in these pits in East Kalimantan.

“What’s going to happen with these 94 mining pits?” Merah said. “A lot of people have already died there. If they’re going to be rehabilitated, whose money will be used?”

Shared project

Speaking to reporters during a recent visit to East Kalimantan, President Widodo said it’s inevitable that businesses will play a major role in building the new capital, given that the government can’t afford to pick up the estimated $33.5 billion tab on its own.

“The project has to be shared,” Widodo said as quoted by local media. “There’s no way we could do it by ourselves. The state budget will be dried out [if that’s the case]. It means that the involvement of [parties] outside the government is much needed.”

The forestry ministry, tasked with carrying out a strategic environmental assessment, says the existing concessions and the environmental damage associated with them won’t be a problem. Instead, it will be an opportunity to revitalize the area, according to Laksmi Wijayanti, the ministry’s acting inspector general. She said the government would require concession holders to rehabilitate their concessions, including mining areas.

“The [environmental] problems there are actually a moment [for us] to solve the problems of East Kalimantan, where environmental destruction is already at a chronic level,” she said.

She added the government had earmarked at least 85,000 ha (210,000 acres) of land around the new capital for conservation purposes, including wildlife habitat.

“Parts of these 85,000 hectares are actually already damaged, so we’ll focus on these areas so that they can be restored properly,” Laksmi said. “The government won’t waive [mining companies’ violations], but we’ll accelerate [the rehabilitation of their mining pits] so that they can carry out their obligations quickly.”

They nailed Java to the tropics using parts of Mount Meru, the sacred mountain of the gods. The fragments became the volcanoes that dot the Indonesian archipelago.

Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, is on the northwest coast of Java. In 1900 it had about 115,000 residents; in 1970 about 4.5 million; today, there are more than 10 million in the city proper. Its metropolitan area is the largest in Southeast Asia. The floods in Jakarta last week were the heaviest in recorded history and have claimed at least sixty lives. But it’s a difference of scale, not kind. The floods come every year.

Yunarso lives in a small kampung, or informal settlement, in West Jakarta. It was one of the worst-affected areas, with over a metre of floodwater inundating the houses. ‘Did we prepare for this?’ the 36-year-old said. ‘No, nothing. We were celebrating New Year’s Eve until it was late. Then we laid our heads down for a moment and in the morning the water was everywhere.’

‘What can you do? This is Indonesia,’ said his father, Sukarman, the elected head of the neighbourhood. He grew up in Central Java and moved to the city when he was 19. ‘Where I grew up, it flooded the rice fields. Here, it floods our houses. But either way, this is what happens during the season.’ Neither of them has plans to relocate.

As I walked around, three days into the new year, my feet squelching in mud, I saw groups of children with plastic nets, trawling the waterways for catfish. ‘Are those safe to eat?’ I asked Yunarso. ‘Of course,’ he said. ‘They’re like pond fish.’ The water was grey, with black detritus floating on top. Fetid pools of water and mud stretched out in every direction.

Just outside the kampung were rows of mega-mansions, now seemingly with moats. Near one mock Palladian villa, teenage boys admired their catch of the day under a plaster statue of a maenad. But here, too, the acrid smell of garbage and sludge was pervasive. And many of these houses, too, did not escape the floods this year.

An aerial photo went viral on New Year’s Day, showing the Shangri-La Hotel with its manicured grounds and cerulean pool, seemingly untouched – there were even a few swimmers – while the ordinary houses nearby were submerged in brown floodwater.

Many residents of kampungs in north and west Jakarta said no formal relief had reached them. More than 400,000 people have been displaced and there are two more months of heavy rains ahead. The governor of Jakarta, Anies Baswedan, has been criticised for allocating more money to an upcoming Formula E race than to flood mitigation.

The natural disasters ministry has acknowledged that the extreme weather is in part a result of climate change: ‘The rain this time,’ it said, ‘was not normal rain.’ Whether it’s normal or not, Jakarta is especially vulnerable.

The city lies in a large floodplain, downstream of such high-rainfall regions as the Puncak hills, and 40 per cent of the city is technically below sea level. Dams might be helpful: there were eight hundred in the Dutch colonial era, but only about two hundred remain today and 80 per cent of them are useless, according to Jakarta’s Urban Poor Consortium. Most of the swampland underlying the city has been drained in the last half-century because of development. Parts of Jakarta are sinking 25 cm per year, sixty times faster than Venice.

Many have taken the floods as evidence to support Indonesia’s plan to relocate its capital city to Borneo. It makes no sense to live here any more, they say. Perhaps. But not everyone would move, and the relocation would deplete the city’s disaster management resources even further. And what happens when there’s nowhere left to move to? As Jakarta flooded, across the Timor Sea, Australia burned. For how much longer will Melbourne and Sydney be considered among the world’s ‘most liveable’ cities?

For the millions who will stay in Jakarta to see next year’s floods, the Urban Poor Consortium insists that ‘a better city is possible.’ A few years ago, Governor Joko Widodo and his deputy, Basuki ‘Ahok’ Tjahaja Purnama, embarked on an ambitious project to ‘normalise’ the city’s rivers – dredging them, straightening their banks, lining them with walls – which brought relief to the people living beside them for the first time in decades. Ahok, who became acting governor when Widodo became president of Indonesia, suggested that Jakarta could be flood-free by 2022, which sounded crazy, then briefly possible, and now rather hopeless; Ahok lost the 2017 gubernatorial election to Baswedan, went to prison for blasphemy, and has said he is finished with politics. Last June a plan was approved to build a 25-mile sea wall across Jakarta Bay. Construction is supposed to begin in 2023. Meanwhile, the waters continue to rise, Jakarta sinks, and the rain comes down.","Tue, 07 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.lrb.co.uk/media/cache/social_image/var/site/storage/images/2/5/4/1/11741452-1-eng-GB/jakarta.jpg,"['jakarta', 'ahok', 'normal', '2020', 'lrb', 'java', 'rain', 'water', 'governor', 'floods', 'sea', 'houses', 'city']",

As the Northeast Monsoon continues, several flooding events have occurred in the southern part of ASEAN region, particularly in Indonesia. While on the contrary, dry conditions persisted over the Mekong sub-region, and scattered hotspots continued to be detected especially in Cambodia, southern Myanmar and Thailand. Meanwhile in the Philippines, the Category 1 Typhoon PHANFONE has brought strong winds and heavy rains during Christmas time, the typhoon exited the Philippines Responsibility Area (PAR) as it weakens on 28 December 2019.

HIGHLIGHT:

Typhoon PHANFONE (locally named URSULA) has made landfall during Christmas time (24-26 December 2019) in Region IV-A, V, VI, VII, VIII, and XIII. The Philippine’s National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) reported that number of affected people as per 30 December 2019, almost reaching 2 million, with more than 100.000 people displaced. Previously, about 58.000 people were displaced for pre-emptive evacuation in Regions MIMAROPA, V,VII, and VIII. Currently, the NDRRM Operations Center alert status remains in BLUE. AHA Centre Emergency Operations Centre is on stand-by, and closely monitoring this event.

HYDRO-METEO-CLIMATOLOGICAL:

Outspread rainfall in southern part of ASEAN region, particularly in Indonesia, have caused numbers of localised flooding and landslides. While, rainfall intensities in Peninsular Malaysia have decreased compared to the previous week. In northern part of ASEAN region, heavy rainfall occurred in the Philippines due to Typhoon PHANFONE, while dry conditions in Mekong sub-region persisted.

GEOPHYSICAL:

There were six (6) earthquake events with magnitude 5.0 and above that occurred last week, five (5) in Indonesia (BMKG) and one (1) in the Philippines (PHIVOLCS). None of these earthquakes have caused significant impacts or damages.

OUTLOOK:

The ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC) forecasts that the Northeast Monsoon will continue.

Therefore, dry weather can be expected over the Mekong sub-region, while wet conditions is expected in the southern part of ASEAN region. Based on past year trends, an escalation of hotspot activities can be expected in late-January and February period, particularly over Thailand and Cambodia. Generally, above-normal temperature is favoured over most parts of Southeast Asia until February 2020.","Mon, 30 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1433883-DWeek_52_23-29Dec_2019.png?itok=F0d5CihT,"['subregion', 'rainfall', 'particularly', 'asean', 'dec', 'update', 'typhoon', 'weekly', 'philippines', '2019', 'region', 'southern', 'occurred', '23', 'phanfone', '29', 'disaster']",

Indonesia has not seen the worst of its wet season, despite intense downpours in several cities over the past few days. In fact, the tropical rains will get even heavier within the next three months, the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) warned on Monday.

""The recent extreme rains do not signify the peak [of the wet season]. In Java, including Jakarta, the rains will only get heavier in January, February and March,"" BMKG head Dwikorita Karnawati said in Jakarta.

She said heavier rainfalls are also predicted for Sumatra, Nusa Tenggara, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Papua during the first quarter of next year.

She reminded people to stay alert and check weather forecasts regularly to avoid disruptions from bad weather.

BMKG has been working together with the Public Works and Housing Ministry and the Regional Disaster Management Agency (BPBD) to mitigate the impact of flooding and storms when they happen.

Dwikorita said they have been cleaning drainages, cutting or trimming trees on the side of the road and inspect advertising billboards to make sure they are securely fastened to their metal frames.

On Saturday, a motorcyclist died after a billboard collapsed on him while stopping at a traffic light on Jalan Daan Mogot, West Jakarta, in the middle of a windstorm.

Dwikorita also warned against weather-related hoaxes, which she said are common in the wet season at the end of the year.

""There have already been some hoaxes about earthquakes and tsunamis. I encourage people to check with the BMKG first when they hear news of a natural disaster,"" Dwikorita said.","Mon, 30 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.beritasatu.com/cache/jakartaglobe/640x441-4/2019/12/1576641316.jpg,"['jakarta', 'worst', 'warned', 'seen', 'dwikorita', 'disaster', 'rains', 'season', 'havent', 'hoaxes', 'bmkg', 'wet', 'heavier', 'warns']", 
94,94,FL-2019-000182-IDN,Jakarta flooding death toll rises to 43 - The Border Mail,https://www.bordermail.com.au/story/6564762/jakarta-flooding-death-toll-rises-to-43/,"news, world

The death toll from floods in Indonesia's capital has risen to 43 as rescuers found more bodies amid receding floodwaters, disaster officials say. Monsoon rains and rising rivers submerged at least 182 neighbourhoods in greater Jakarta and caused landslides in the Bogor and Depok districts on the city's outskirts, which buried a dozen people. National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said the fatalities also included those who had drowned or been electrocuted since rivers broke their banks Wednesday after extreme torrential rains throughout New Year's Eve. Three elderly people died of hypothermia. It was the worst flooding since 2013, when 57 people were killed after Jakarta was inundated by monsoon rains. Floodwaters started receded in some parts of the city on Thursday evening, enabling residents to return to their homes. Wibowo said about 397,000 people sought refuge in shelters across the greater metropolitan area. Those returning to their homes found streets covered in mud and debris. Cars that had been parked in driveways were swept away, landing upside down in parks or piled up in narrow alleys. Sidewalks were strewn with sandals, pots and pans and old photographs. Authorities took advantage of the receding waters to clear away mud and remove piles of wet garbage from the streets. Electricity was restored to tens of thousands of residences and businesses. Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusuma domestic airport reopened Thursday after its runway was submerged. Nearly 20,000 passengers had been affected by the closure. The flooding has highlighted Indonesia's infrastructure problems. Jakarta is home to 10 million people, or 30 million including those in its greater metropolitan area. It is prone to earthquakes and flooding and is rapidly sinking due to uncontrolled extraction of ground water. President Joko Widodo announced in August that the capital will move to a site in sparsely populated East Kalimantan province on Borneo island, known for rainforests and orangutans.

Footage of the dramatic rescue of a chained dog from a heavy stream in Cinere, Bogor, West Java, was circulating online on Wednesday evening.

The post was taken from an Instagram story posted by a user with the handle @galaindiga and resposted on Twitter by Twitter user @nihaqus.

It shows a dog desperately trying to break free from his chain amid a heavy stream and rising floodwaters.

The Instagram user wrote that he had seen the flood approach his house in Cinere on Wednesday morning from Bogor and that it was something he had never witnessed in the past 18 years.

""From afar I saw my neighbour’s house tried hard to [withstand] the heavy current. And I just realised that the dog was chained to the house’s fence. Sadly, the dog’s owner was not at home. The only ones seeing this incident were me and the RW head,” he wrote in the caption, with reference to the community unit head.

He added that he had been afraid to rescue the dog as the current was so strong and he saw heavy objects such as cars and iron gates drift away with the stream.

""And also, I did not know how to handle the dog in this kind of situation,” he said.

Finally he contacted local firefighters who came to cut the dog’s chain with an axe. The dog was saved at last.

""Pak RW tried to shelter the dog, which was traumatised. Some locals came to feed it,” @galaindiga said.

Many residents have gone out of town for the year-end holiday that also coincided with a school break.

A story with a less fortunate dog was reported from Kelapa Gading in North Jakarta.

Twitter user @reammapu shared her mother’s Facebook post that tells the story of a rescue efforts for five dogs owned by their next door neighbor.

""The beginning of 2020 started with a rescue mission for five dogs owned by my neighbours, who were on their New Year’s vacation. Since last night, their dogs were very noisy. I thought they were afraid of the thunderstorm. At around five in the morning I peeped into the house, and it turned out a dog had died and was floating,” Rena said in the post.

Rena, her son and other neighbours then broke into the house and evacuated the remaining four dogs, who were cold and shivering.

""Fortunately, the four other dogs could be rescued and immediately sheltered at another neighbour’s house that is not flooded,” Rena said.

An update of the Twitter post said the dog’s owner was a new resident unaware that the area was prone to flooding.

Rena later provided another update to inform readers that the remaining dogs were alright as the owners had returned on Wednesday. She added that the dead dog had been older and weaker than the other four.

Animal rights community Garda Satwa Foundation also took to Instagram, advising pet owners not to cage or chain pets when they leave the house.

""Pet owners whose houses are flooded, if it is not possible to take your pets with you [during evacuation], just make sure they are left unchained and not in a cage, whatever kind of pet you have [birds, chicken, dogs, cats], except for fish. At least if there is no one to help them, they can help themselves,” the post read. – The Jakarta Post (Indonesia)/ANN","Fri, 03 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/01/03/469709.jpg,"['user', 'pets', 'users', 'indonesia', 'heavy', 'hearts', 'dog', 'owners', 'twitter', 'house', 'neighbours', 'floods', 'internet', 'rescue', 'abandoned', 'break', 'post', 'dogs']",

The central and Jakarta regional governments should work in collaboration, not keep busy finding fault with each other. Snide commentary between President Joko Widodo, Public Works and People’s Housing Minister Basoeki Hadimoeljono, and Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan will not stop the floods from recurring in the future.

The failure of the flood control program in the capital city last week indicated just how abysmal government management is at all levels, both at the central and the regional levels. The fact that the flood is no sudden disaster occurring for the very first time just made matters worse. Everybody knows Jakarta and its environs, Tangerang, Depok, and Bekasi, are prone to major flooding. Aside from its land contour forming a natural basin, there are scores of rivers flowing from their upstream in the Bogor area to Jakarta on their way to the Java Sea. Only donkeys never learn from their previous mistakes.

The Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Body (BMKG) had in fact issued a disaster warning at end of last year. On December 27, 2019, the BMKG released news that several provinces would suffer heavy rainfall coupled with strong winds as the year ended, including the Jakarta capital city, Banten, and West Java. But the warning was not acted upon.

Many studies have been made on flood management, but execution has never been holistic. Our public officials prefer debating on things such as terminology concerning “naturalisation versus normalization” and shrug their shoulders when inquired why the Ciliwung River normalization project was ony half-done and is currently in shambles. The project to widen the river has only been carried out along 16 kilometers from the original plan for 30 kilometers. Once motifs take a political bent, solutions become hard to come by.

Frankly speaking, the Ciliwung project was not a matter of mere land release. Nor was it a matter of physical obstruction when correcting the river flow to the Jakarta Bay estuary. Legal umbrellas can be created, regulations are easily changed— if the impediment lay in the regulations. The real crux of the matter lay in jammed up coordination between central government and the regional government. For what it’s worth, the governor is the long hand of central government. If the regional head ignores a national program, there should have been ways of forcing him to move forward.

This is not a pure Jakarta case. Management of Puncak and development of several dams in West Java faced the same attitude. Two dams slated for completion end of this year, the Ciawi and Sukamahi Dams, could not solve the problems if the forests of the region continue to be depleted. Shifts in zonation regulations of the Puncak area, originally allocated as a water basin, into a tourism and residential zone, could only have happened when state apparatus did not work effectively. Years and years of neglect have never been corrected by central government.

With the routine flood disasters occurring every year, Jakarta should have become the world’s best laboratorium to anticipate flooding. Many innovative public policies and infrastructure could have been tried and tested and studied for effectiveness. Public officials need to make breakthroughs that go beyond the cubicles separating central and regional administrations. Unfortunately, this has never happened because we are too busy fault-finding every time a flood occurs.","Tue, 07 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2020/01/07/733598/733598_720.jpg,"['river', 'matter', 'jakarta', 'flood', 'blame', 'central', 'public', 'management', 'regional', 'floods', 'project', 'game', 'jakartas', 'regulations']",

The heavy drumming of rain outside woke her up and led her to see what was going on. As she got out of bed, she stepped into knee-deep water. This resident of Kampung Baru, Halim Perdanakusuma, East Jakarta, panicked. She was at home with her mother, 62, and two daughters, aged fifteen and eight. Her husband was not home because he was working in Cengkareng, West Jakarta.

Diah attempted to save her household belongings, including the refrigerator and their mattresses. However, the water continued to rise, and her efforts were in vain. Nearly everything on the first floor was underwater. Her mother and children moved to the second floor. At around 7am the electricity went out. They were trapped at home. At around noon, the water rose even higher. “It reached 1.5 meters deep,” she said on Friday, January 3.

Diah and her family shivered as they endured some hunger pangs. They only had a two-liter bottle of drinking water, which they managed to take up to the second floor. At 3pm, her husband returned and rescued them.

According to Diah, this flood was more severe than those in previous years. In 2016, her house had flooded, but only came to calf level and quickly subsided.

Flooding also inundated several areas in Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi. According to the National Disaster Relief Agency (BNPB), over 100,000 people evacuated and at least thirty people died. The flooding was triggered by extreme precipitation. For seventeen hours, staring on the afternoon of Tuesday, December 31, heavy rains fell on Jakarta and its vicinities.

Fachri Rajab, Head of BMKG’s Public Meteorology Center, said that more rain fell around Jakarta from December 31 to January 1 than in the upstream area. “The rains in Jakarta fell into the heavy to extreme category,” said Fachri. The highest daily precipitation measured around Halim Perdanakusuma Airport in East Jakarta, was 377 millimeters. Operations at that airport were temporarily suspended due to flooded runways.

According to Fachri, that figure is the highest it has been over the past several years. Rain in Bogor was in the heavy category with rainfall of 60 millimeters. Despite not being as heavy as in Jakarta, the precipitation in Bogor also contributed to the flooding in the Capital. Over a dozen rivers which flow into Jakarta Bay start in Bogor.

After observing flood points by helicopter with Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan and BNPB Head Doni Monardo, Minister of Public Works and Housing Basoeki Hadimoeljono voiced his disgruntlement regarding the project to widen the Ciliwung River. Basoeki lamented that some regions were still flooding because that project has stalled. To his view, flooding in Jakarta could be prevented if the work on the Ciliwung River had been completed. “I’m sorry to say, Governor, during the combing of the Ciliwung River, it turns out that of its 33 kilometers only sixteen have been normalized. The parts that haven’t been normalized are flooded,” said Basoeki on Wednesday, January 1.

The parts of the Ciliwung River which have been “normalized” were part of a central government project. Flow was improved by widening the river to 35-50 meters, fortifying the area along the riverbanks, and building embankments. According to Basoeki, this project has been delayed due to land not being cleared for the project, which is the duty of the Jakarta Provincial Government. Indonesian President Joko Widodo said that land had stopped being cleared in 2017.

In 2018, Anies said he was against the concept of “normalizing” the river by installing reinforced concrete sheet pile, or evicting people who lived on the riverbanks. He proposed a “naturalization” concept of widening the river without using sheet pile along the banks.

After being derided by Basoeki, Anies made a counter-accusation. According to Anies, river “normalization” is not effective for preventing floods. He said that Kampung Pulo, in East Jakarta, was still flooded even though the Ciliwung River there had already been “normalized”. Anies highlighted dam or retention basin construction projects in upstream areas by the central government. If those projects are completed, according to Anies, the volume of water coming downstream can be controlled. “So we will look to see how the central government does,” he said, “because in Jakarta our focus is on the safety of city residents.”

Anies is not completely correct. Erna Susati, a resident of Kebon Baru, South Jakarta, said her home had rarely seen flooding since the body of the Ciliwung River was normalized in her area in 2014. Erna’s house is located at Jalan F, Gang C, RT 17 RW 04. According to this 29-year-old woman, before river “normalization” was done, the flooding in her house could reach up to four meters high. This past year, the inundation was less, despite flooding still occurring. Now the flooding at her house is ‘only ‘ waist high.

Ahmad Nasohi, a resident of Kampung Baru who also operates the water pump at the Water Resource Office of South Jakarta, verified the information that before the Ciliwung River was normalized, flooding in their area tended to be higher. After the project was complete the water levels were lower.

•••

Three days before the flooding in Jakarta and vicinity, the BMKG predicted heavy rains and strong winds for some areas, including Jakarta, Banten, and West Java. This warning was passed on to the National Disaster Relief Agency, the office of public works, and the provincial disaster relief agencies through a WhatsApp chat group. The BMKG also released this information on their website and in the social media.

BMKG Head Dwikorita Karnawati said the warning was continually updated up to New Year’s Day. “For certain, we always provide information about (weather) conditions ahead of time for people to anticipate and conduct prevention measures,” said Dwikorita.

As it turned out, despite the early warning, the government was unprepared to deal with the floodwaters. In some places logistical assistance and rubber rafts to evacuate people arrived late. Sri Kendari, 55, was stuck on the roof of her older brother’s house for over thirteen hours at Kemang Melati 7, Block Q, Number 24, Bekasi. The woman, her older brother, and nephew were cold and shivering. “The current was strong and the water outside reached to chest height,” said Sri.

Sri did not receive any notification from the local government before the flood occurred. After the flood came, there was no serious response from the emergency numbers of the BNPB and the Search and Rescue (SAR) team she contacted to ask to be evacuated. She could only evacuate after the waters receded at 5am on Thursday, January 2. “They said asked me to share my (GPS) location. I sent it, but up until the time the flood had receded they had not come,” said Sri.

Flood victims who evacuated to the football field at Jalan Juanda, Margahayu, Bekasi City, received no assistance for 36 hours. Some thirty people were there, from infants to adults. “Milk and ready-to-eat food was needed most,” said Deni, a victim.

Bekasi Mayor Rahmat Effendi did not deny that evacuation went slowly. West Java Governor Ridwan Kamil said evacuation was delayed because traffic obstructed access to the location. As a result, assistance such as rubber rafts, from outside Bekasi could not reach the intended location. “We also had trouble reaching that spot,” said Ridwan in Bekasi on Thursday January 2.","Tue, 07 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2020/01/07/733614/733614_720.jpg,"['anies', 'river', 'jakarta', 'heavy', 'water', 'flooding', 'house', 'normalized', 'project', 'ciliwung']",
