The situation is grim situation in the state as 30.55 lakh people have so far been affected due to the deluge, as per an official report.

Floods have also left as many as 187 animals dead, including 16 rhinos, in the Kaziranga National Park.

Here are the five reasons why the northeastern state witnesses flood every year

One of the key reasons for annual deluge in the state is the high percentage of flood prone region. According to the Rastriya Barh Ayog (RBA), 31.05 lakh hectares of the total 78.523 lakh hectares area of the state is prone to frequent floods. And the reasons behind this high flood prone area percentage are both man-made and natural.

EARTHQUAKES/LANDSLIDES

Assam and some other parts of the northeastern region are prone to frequent earthquakes, which causes landslides. The landslides and earthquakes send in a lot of debris in the rivers, causing the river bed to rise.

BANK EROSION

Assam has also faced bank erosion around the Brahmaputra and Barak rivers as well as their tributaries. It is estimated that annually nearly 8000 hectares land is lost to erosion. Bank erosion has also affected the width of the Brahmaputra river, which has increased up to 15 km. The damage cost due to bank erosion is estimated to be of several hundred crore every year.

DAMS

Among the man-made reasons, the key cause of floods in Assam region is releasing of water from dams situated uphill. Unregulated release of water floods the Assam plains, leaving thousands of people homeless every year.

ENCROACHMENT

Encroachment in forest lands and water bodies is another main reason that causes flood in the state.

NON-IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECT

Looking at the grim situation, the Centre had sanctioned a project of Brahmaputra dredging during the Prime Minister Narendra Modis first term, however, sources said that the project is yet to begin. The project involves dredging a stretch of 891 km of Brahmaputra from Sadiya in the north to Dhubri in the south of the state. The entire project, which also includes the construction of the Brahmaputra Expressway on both sides of the river would cost Rs 40,000 crore. But it is still in the planning stage. While speaking about the project, Assam Minister of Irrigation Department, Revenue & Disaster Management, Bhabesh Kalita said, The project was announced by the Centre and the implementation process has been started.""

At the initial stage, the Assam government finalised the tenders for the project and tenders will be called within a short period, the minister said.","Mon, 22 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201907/Assa_0-647x363.png?E8EZWoc8xDkPlDWGhYKAulyvzCeDo.AS,"['reasons', 'situation', 'prone', 'water', 'brahmaputra', 'flood', 'state', 'erosion', 'assam', 'project', 'witnesses']", ,flood

It's tucked away in the inside pages of national newspapers, rarely makes it to prime time TV bulletins, hardly finds mention in the national discourse on development...floods in Assam are an annual affair, rarely raising more than an eyebrow.

As sure as night follows day, floods in Assam (and in most parts of the Northeast) follow the monsoon. This year has been no different.

According to data put out by Assam State Disaster Management Authority, till July 18 the death toll has touched 27 and is likely to go up. Over 4,000 villages in 28 districts out of the state's 33 have been affected.

Assam's population is just over 3 crore; of this 53.5 lakh-plus people are under threat. While close to 1,000 houses have been damaged, 88 animals have been washed away. Over 16 lakh animals, including livestock have been affected. Pictures of rhinos trying to reach higher grounds at the Kaziranga National Park surfaced on Thursday.

Over 2 lakh hectares of crop land have been affected by the flood waters. Infrastructure -- roads, bridges, culverts - and public utilities have also taken a hit.

Floods lead to loss in human lives and the economy takes a big hit. According to Central Water Commission data (1953-2016) on average 26 lakh people are affected every year in Assam; 47 lose lives, 10,961 cattle die, Rs 7 crore worth of houses destroyed and the total damage comes up to Rs 128 crore every year.

Why is Assam flood-prone?

There are both natural and man-made causes for the annual deluge.

Most of Assam falls under a meteorological zone that receives excessive rain during the monsoon season. According to the Brahmaputra Board, a central body under the Ministry of Jal Shakti tasked to monitor and control floods, the region receives rainfall ""ranging from 248 cm to 635...Rainfall of more than 40 mm in an hour is frequent and around 70 mm per hour is also not uncommon"". There have been occasions when 500 mm of rainfall has been recorded in a day.

The valley through which the Brahmaputra flows is narrow. While the river occupies 6-10 km, there are forest covers on either side. The remaining area is inhabited and farming is conducted in the low-lying areas. Overflowing rivers and flowing rapidly down the valley tend to spill over when it reaches the narrow strips.

(Photo: AP)

The zone's topography also complicates matters. The steep slopes force the rivers to gush down to the plains.

Assam lies in a seismic zone -- in fact most of the Northeast does. Frequent earthquakes and resultant landslides push soil and debris into the rivers. This sedimentation raises river beds.

According to a paper published in the International Journal for Scientific Research and Development, ""Brahmaputra water contains more sediments raising river by 3 metres in some places and reducing the water carrying capacity of the river.""

Then there are man-made causes that have worsened the flood situation. Encroachment is a big issue. The population density of Brahmaputra valley was 9-29 people per sq km in 1940-41; this shot up to 200 people per sq km now, according Brahmaputra Board.

The systematic destruction of wetlands and water bodies that act as natural run-offs have aggravated the flood problem in Assam. Though embankments provide protection, most of them have not been maintained leading to breaches.

Is there a way out?

First and foremost is the need for early warning systems. There are reports that around the Assam-Bhutan border, villagers form WhatsApp groups to warn people of rising water levels.

If such people-people arrangements can work out then there is no reason why more institutionalised systems, based on technology, cannot be put in place.

These early warning systems should be institutionalised based on scientific approach.

Wetlands and local water bodies should be revived so that the natural drainage system can act as a basin for excess water to flow. This would entail clearing human encroachments in the Brahmaputra flood plains.

Embankments should be regularly checked for breaches and systems put in place for maintenance; a first step would be to break the babu-contractor nexus that finds floods an easy way to sponge money from the system.","Sat, 20 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201907/AP19195498615317-647x363.jpeg?VkfYbQVh3urTmJpGWSsaxFTrKVVn5Ycb,"['water', 'systems', 'brahmaputra', 'flood', 'tryst', 'affected', 'rivers', 'annual', 'floods', 'misery', 'assam', 'assams', 'valley', 'monsoon', 'natural', 'river']", ,flood

With the flood situation in Assam deteriorating further, the government on Tuesday released Rs 251.55 crore as assistance from the central share of SDRF for 2019-20.

Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for the prompt release of the funds even as the death toll mounted to 17 and floodwaters submerged 30 of the 33 districts, PTI reported. “This shall immensely help in relief operations and mitigating suffering of people affected by Assam floods,” ANI quoted Sarma as saying.

According to Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), more than 45 lakh people have been affected in 4,620 villages of the state, with 1,01,085 people taking refuge in 226 relief camps, PTI reported. As many as 562 distribution centres have been set up for providing relief to the affected people.

As many as 1,556 villages across Dhemaji, Biswanath, Sonitpur, Darrang, Baksa, Barpeta, Nalbari, Chirang, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, Goalpara, Morigaon, Hojai, Nagaon, Golaghat, Majuli, Jorhat, Sivsagar, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia districts have been hit by the deluge.

Barpeta is the worst hit with 7.35 lakh people affected, followed by Morigaon where 3.50 lakh people are hit. In Dhubri, around 3.38 lakh people have been affected, according to the ASDMA.

Besides the NDRF, the Army has been deployed in Assam to aid the personnel in rescuing marooned people, PTI reported.

The part of Brahmaputra river that passes through the state capital is flowing above danger mark due to incessant rains in the region. The water level has increased and entered the Chakreshwar temple in Kalipur.

Due to the heavy rains, Section 144 was imposed around the vicinity of the Kaziranga National Park(KNP). The Assam Ministry of Forest and Environment said 90 per cent of the Kaziranga National Park in Golaghat and Nagaon districts was still submerged.

Moreover, 150 anti-poaching camps have been affected due to the floods and authorities are working round the clock to check poaching at the UNESCO world heritage site.

Some of the animals have taken shelter in highlands within the park and many are migrating to the southern highlands of Karbi Anglong, crossing National Highway 37.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on Monday spoken to Chief Minister Sonowal to take stock of the flood situation, including the condition of the KNP, and assured all possible help and support.

Rahul Gandhi appeals to Congress workers

Meanwhile, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday appealed to party workers in flood-hit Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Tripura and Mizoram to help in relief and rescue efforts.

Assam is in the grip of yet another flood, with 57 lakh people affected across all 33 districts, and 36 people killed besides hundreds of animals. This is the first wave of floods this monsoon, and flood control experts expect at least two more. A look at why Assam has traditionally been flood-prone, what measures have been taken over the years, and what has been proposed as a long-term solution:

Why are floods so destructive in Assam?

Apart from incessant rainfall during the monsoon, there are many contributory factors, natural and man-made. At the crux is the very nature of the river Brahmaputra —dynamic and unstable. Its 580,000 sq km basin spreads over four countries: China, India, Bangladesh and Bhutan, with diverse environments.

The Brahmaputra features among the world’s top five rivers in terms of discharge as well as the sediment it brings. At 19,830 cubic meters per second (cumec), it ranks fourth in discharge at the mouth, behind only the Amazon (99,150 cumec), the Congo (39,660 cumec) and the Yangtze (21,800 cumec), according to data from a 2008 research paper by retired Gauhati University professor Dulal Chandra Goswami, an environmentalist acknowledged as an authority on the Brahmaputra. In terms of sediment yield, two spots along the Brahmaputa’s course were at second and third places in 2008, behind the Yellow River whose annual sediment yield is 1,403 tonnes per sq km. The Brahmaputra’s annual sediment yield was 1,128 tonnes per sq km at Bahadurabad of Bangladesh, and 804 tonnes per sq km at Pandu of Guwahati.

Assam floods: The vast amount of sediment comes from Tibet, where the river originates. Assam floods: The vast amount of sediment comes from Tibet, where the river originates.

How do these characteristics of the river relate to flooding?

The vast amount of sediment comes from Tibet, where the river originates. “That region is cold, arid and lacks plantation. Glaciers melt, soil erodes and all of it results in a highly sedimented river,” said Dhrubajyoti Borgohain, a retired chief engineer of the Brahmaputra Board, a central government body functioning under the Jal Shakti Ministry’s Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, and whose responsibilities include flood control in the Brahmaputra basin.

By the time the river enters Assam — a state comprising primarily floodplains surrounded by hills on all sides — it deposits vast amounts of this silt, leading to erosion and floods. “As the river comes from a high slope to a flat plain, its velocity decreases suddenly and this results in the river unloading the sediment,” said Borgohain. The river’s channels prove inadequate amid this siltation, leading to floods.

Again, because of the earthquake-prone nature of the region, the river has not been able to acquire a stable character. Following the devastating earthquake of 1950, the level of the Brahmaputra rose by two metres in Dibrugarh area in eastern Assam.

Besides these natural factors are the man-made ones — habitation, deforestation, population growth in catchment areas (including in China) — which lead to higher sedimentation. For example, the sediment deposition itself creates temporary sandbars or river islands.

It is common for people to settle in such places, which restricts the space the river has to flow. When rainfall is heavy, it combines with all these factors and leads to destructive floods. This happens very frequently.

How bad is the current flood compared to previous ones?

While floods are a regular annual feature in Assam, some years witness more destruction than others. In terms of impact on human lives, the floods of 1988, 1998 and 2004 were the worst; the 2004 floods alone affected 12.4 million people and claimed 251 lives. The current wave of floods has affected 57 lakh people and claimed 36 lives so far. But experts say that the worst is yet to come.

“This is only the first major flood wave this season. We are expected to experience two to three more flood waves until the end of the rainy season, which will last till mid-October. In terms of total annual scale and effect of flooding, we had seen worse floods in 1988, 1998, 2004 and 2012. But if a few more large flood waves hit the state in the next two-and-a-half months, this year could well be recorded as one of the most severe flood years,” said Partha J Das, who heads the Water, Climate & Hazard Division of Guwahati-based Aaranyak.

Has the government tried to address the factors that cause floods?

In its master plan on the river in 1982, the Brahmaputra Board had suggested that dams and reservoirs be built to mitigate floods. The idea of dams, however, has traditionally been a double-edged sword. While one of their objectives is to regulate the release of flood waters, the release when it comes can sometimes be beyond the capacity of the channels downstream. In the Brahmaputra basin, locals and environmentalists protested against dam-building plans on grounds of displacement and destruction of evology, preventing the plans from moving forward.

“The Brahmaputra Board proposed a multipurpose dam in the present Gerukamukh site where NHPC (National Hydroelectric Power Corporation) is constructing the Subansiri Lower Hydroelectric Project. But the proposal was scrapped because of objections by the Arunachal government due to submergence [concerns], which included a few small towns as well,” said Guwahati-based environmentalist and engineer Pradip Kumar Bhuyan. In fact, the Subansiri project — on which the government spent crores — too has been suspended.

As such, the government has been using only one approach towards floods: building embankments on the river. “Embankments were proposed only as an interim and ad hoc measure for short-term mitigation,” said Aaranyak’s Das. Their lack of durability has often been on display.

“Most embankments built in the 1980s are not strong enough. Since they were temporary measures, the government did not spend on high-specification embankments. These are weak and are regularly breached,” a government official said.

The government also considered dredging, basically digging up the riverbed and making the river “deeper”. However, experts have strongly advised against this simply because the Brahmaputra sediment yield is among the highest in the world. “Experts believe that even if we take out all the silt this year, more silt will be deposited the following year, making the very expensive effort futile,” said Borgohain, the retired Brahmaputra Board engineer.

Dr Goswami, the retired Gauhati University professor, feels that the government’s measures have been “piecemeal” and “short-term”.

“They are not addressing the problem at the source — they are firefighting,” Dr Goswami said.

But, is there a long-term solution?

Dr Goswami said that for a sustainable solution, there needs to be “a basin-wide approach” to the problem. He calls this an “integrated basin management” system that should ideally bring in all the basin-sharing countries on board. “Addressing the issues only in Assam when the flood strikes isn’t the solution — one needs the countries to come to an understanding about taking measures in the catchment areas.” For that, interstate relationships, political cooperation and the role of the government are important.

Borgohain suggested “flood-plain” zoning, which is done the US. “Depending on the vulnerability of the area, you divide them into categories, and accordingly ban certain activities on it: like farming, building a house etc,” he said, “That is one option. We can’t help the rain but we can certainly control the damage caused by floods.”","Sat, 20 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/07/assam-4.jpg,"['sediment', 'prone', 'brahmaputra', 'gauhati', 'flood', 'affected', 'comes', 'east', 'floods', 'assam', 'explained', 'solution', 'river']", ,flood

FOR TWO days now, Parvesh Kumar, a rescuer from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), has been trying to persuade Rina Begum, a resident of Tulsibari village in Assam’s Morigaon district, to leave her half-submerged house.

Over the last 48 hours, as rescuers shuttle her neighbours from their marooned homes to dry land, Begum, a 50-year-old grandmother of four, watched but remained defiant. “How can we leave our home?” she says, standing in waist-deep water.

Kumar says Begum’s family isn’t the only reluctant one. “There are many families who are refusing to leave their homes,” he says. “Yesterday, we went to a very remote area. There were 20 people stuck in one house, but only seven came back with us.” The team still gave the villagers their phone number, in case they changed their mind. Later at night, as the water rose, Kumar got a call. “When it gets worse, they change their mind usually,” he says.

According to Kumar, the families who agree to be rescued make sure that their documents are safe too. “So many times, we brought them to safety only to go back again because they realise they have forgotten their documents,” says Kumar.

For Begum, her daughter, and four grand-daughters, the youngest a six-month-old, the only safe space is their bed, supported by two sticks, and tied up at a higher level. On it, the infant sleeps, as floodwaters from an overflowing Brahmaputra swivel around. Their clothes have been washed away, upturned chairs float in the brown water, and at a distance, the tin-roof of their toilet is bare visible.

When the rains came on July 8, Begum did not pay much attention. This was regular. When the waters started rising, it still did not perturb her. This had happened the previous year, too.

But by Sunday afternoon, when two embankments in the Laharighat and Bhuragaon revenue circles were breached and the water rose above their waists, Begum and her daughter started stowing away their paddy on the roof. As did her sister-in-law and niece, in the house next door. Their husbands, daily wage workers, were in Dibrugarh.

Begum’s family is among the 52 lakh people who have been affected by the first wave of floods this monsoon. At least 30 out of 33 districts in Assam are reeling, with 1,47,304 people in 695 relief camps. About 95 per cent of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Kaziranga is under water. Many say it’s the worse deluge in more than a decade.

In Morigaon, more than 5 lakh people have been affected. In Laharighat revenue circle, where Begum’s home is, 1 lakh people have been affected, with the NDRF in action for the past five days.

Sofikul Islam, a 45-year-old farmer, lost not just the two bikes his family owned, but goats too. “Our house has gone under but that happened two years ago as well,” he says. “The flimsy embankments don’t help. All of them are made of sand and are not strong. What we need is better rehabilitation when the flood strikes.”

While rice, salt and dal have reached the village, residents claim it’s neither enough nor equally divided. At the revenue circle office, an official says, “Relief takes time to reach us.

The monsoon rainfall has wreaked havoc in the famed Kaziranga National Park, killing as many as 209 animals in the 430 square km park situated along the Brahmaputra river. The casualty has been the highest among Hog deers, small deers with unusually large round ears. A total of 111 Hog deers, 18 Wildboars, 17 Rhinos, 12 Sambars, seven Swamp Deers, three porcupine, two water buffaloes and one elephant has drowned in the submerged park.

Animals have moved to the boundaries of the park and some have even attempted to cross the park to reach nearby higher grounds. As many as 16 Hog deers and one Sambhar was killed after they got hit by vehicles on the national highway-37 bordering the park, as per the data shared by the state government.

The forest officials with the help of local people have been trying to rescue as many animals as they can. As on Tuesday, at least 64 animals have been rescued. Five animals who were rescued and put under care, however succumbed.

The flood waters have destroyed several lakh hectares of cropland across the state, damaging houses, embankments and other buildings. The road connectivity to some far-off villages has also been affected.

According to the latest Central Water Commission (CWC) report river Manas, Beki and Gaurang which are tributaries of the mighty Bhahmaputra river are flowing in severe flood situation in the districts of Baksa, Kamrup, Nalbari, Barpeta, Kokrajhar and Dhubri.

The CWC has directed authorities to step up the disaster relief measures, as rivers- Aie, Champamati, Gaurang, Manas and Beki are currently flowing very near to their Highest Flood Level and may flow above the level also during the next 24 hours.

On Tuesday, the state received 42.9 mm rainfall against the normal of 13.5 mm during the 24 hours. Meghalaya too received 86.6 mm against the normal of 23.8 mm during the day. Western Assam districts have been the worst hit.

The state weather department has predicted heavy rainfall at isolated places to continue over the next three days, however, the forecast by India Metrological Department (IMD), has indicated that the intensity of rainfall over Assam, Meghalaya and Sikkim could reduce after Thursday.

“There is a likely southward shift of the monsoon trough (a low pressure area associated with rainfall) and probable formation of a low pressure area over coastal areas of West Bengal around 26 July,"" stated IMD in its forecast. This would lead to increase in rainfall intensity over Central India, adjoining northern parts of peninsular India and along the northern plains, starting Wednesday.

The situation remains grim in Bihar as well, where rivers Bagmati, Adhwara Group, Kamla Balan, Kosi and Mahananda continue to flow in severe to above normal flood situation. “This is likely to continue for another two-three days and then slowly recede as rainfall activity has been forecasted to reduce,"" as per CWC.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi Friday assured a delegation of MPs from Assam of providing all central assistance to the flood-hit state where 28 of the 33 districts have been affected by the deluge. The rampaging flood has so far claimed the lives of 48 people and displaced nearly 54 lakh people, news agency ANI reported.

The assurance to 10 BJP MPs from Assam came after they called on the PM Modi to apprise him about the flood situation in the state and urged him to provide financial assistance to tide over the crisis.

“The Prime Minister gave us a patient hearing and assured that all central assistance will be given to the state government to provide succour to the distress people,” MP from Mangaldoi Dilip Saikia told PTI after the meeting.

Though the Central government on Tuesday released Rs 251.55 crore as assistance from the central share of SDRF for 2019-20, the team also submitted a memorandum to Modi urging him to announce a special package to mitigate the floods, which every year damage roads, houses, and crops.

“The flood damages happen every year and it affects the entire Assam and it has become a nightmare for the people of Assam,” the memorandum said. Saikia said 1.11 lakh flood-affected people are currently in relief camps and the deluge has hit 114 revenue circles of the state.

This has forced the wild animals, including rhinos, elephants, deer and wild boars, to take refuge in artificial highlands constructed within the parks or migrate to the southern highlands of Karbi Anglong hills.

Wildlife suffered a huge loss as 90 per cent of the Kaziranga National Park was submerged in water

After the flood, even as the water level receded, citizens struggled with the after-effects of what it had done

Assam witnessed its worst flood scenario in decades recently. Unlike previous years, this time the flood affected all 33 districts of the state which also includes two hill districts of Dima Hasao and Karbi Anglong. More than 80 people lost their lives whereas loss of property amounted to crores.

The Kaziranga National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, witnessed the worst in its recorded history. The wildlife suffered a huge loss as 90 percent of the park was submerged in water, with the only silver lining being that the floods have historically led to renewal of the plant ecology in the park. Now, as with the worst of the flood situation having come to an end, waters have receded, but the plight continues especially for the poor farmers and those living close to the Brahmaputra and its tributaries. Due to heavy silt deposit during the floods, much of the agricultural land is now almost useless, not fit for any cultivation. In some places the situation is so bad that one to two feet of silt have covered the plots.

In a remote char (small river island) of Dhekiajuli, Siraj Ali, a farmer Republic spoke to lost all his lifetime savings. He invested around Rs 5 lakh to cultivate corn this year. The cultivation was good. But the sudden flood washed away his corn field. Helpless, he now has no door to knock on as it was not insured.

""I'm devastated. I'm looking towards the government now,"" said Siraj.

Many farmers in Assam never insure their crops, mostly because of lack of awareness. Another major threat for the people living near the Brahmaputra and its tributaries is posed by erosion. Every year lakhs of hectares of land are being gulped by the rivers. Erosion has been a major threat to the state since a long time. But so far no concrete solutions have been formulated to solve this issue once and for all. Be it Rohmoria in Dibrugarh, Ghunahuti in Lakhimpur, Lahorighat in Morigaon, Binapara in Dhubri by the Brahmaputra or Kachubari in Karimganj by Longai, Nandigram in Silchar by Barak, across Assam the scenario is very grim.

Impact and scale of flooding are likely to increase over the following days as additional rainfall is forecasted, several rivers, including the Brahmaputra, have risen above danger levels across various location and assessments are ongoing. The monsoon season lasts until September, severe flooding in north-eastern states usually takes place in July and August. The impact on agriculture and infrastructure is likely to lead to longer-term effects on livelihoods and food security, as 80% of the population depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.

""It has been around 1.5 months here. We are getting ration and medical treatment. But employment and education have been affected adversely,"" they said.

As of July 31, a total of 12 districts and 26 revenue circles of Assam are reeling under floods.

Currently, 436 relief camps are operational in Baksa, Nalbari, Barpeta, Chirang, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, Dhubri, Kamrup, Morigaon, Nagaon, Golaghat, and Jorhat districts.

Several rivers are flowing above the danger mark like the Brahmaputra river at Neamatighat in Jorhat and Dhubri, Jia Bharali in Sonitpur district, Puthimari in Kamrup district and Beki and Kushiara rivers in Barpeta and Karimganj districts, respectively.","Thu, 01 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201908/db-647x363.png?ZwAURtKKU9AA9ui_mLIGn8SZK28auUno,"['water', 'relief', 'started', 'kaziranga', '12', 'recedes', 'floods', 'assam', 'pobitora', 'animals', 'rhinos', 'national', 'sanctuaries', 'district', 'level', 'park']", ,flood
18,18,FL-2019-000084-IND,Monsoon brings danger and opportunity for Assam's rhinos - Save the Rhino International,https://www.savetherhino.org/asia/india/monsoon-brings-danger-and-opportunity-for-assams-greater-one-horned-rhinos/,"Summer may conjure up thoughts of beaches, BBQs, ice cream and fun in the sun (when it does shine in the UK!). However, in Assam, in northeast India, summer brings entirely different conditions: the monsoon.

What is the monsoon?

In the Indian sub-continent, summer starts with baking hot weather. The sun beats down on the land, heating it up quickly. The air above heats up and rises, creating a deep area of low pressure. This drags in cool air, laden with moisture, from the Indian Ocean like a vacuum. Monsoon winds are followed by biblical downpours, and the vacuum effect is so strong that the rains start in the southwest of India and spread across to the northeast of the country, more than 1,500 miles away.

Here, the monsoon reaches Assam. With the Himalayas rising to the north, the monsoon slows down as the mountains force it upwards, meaning that Assam and the rest of the northeast receive the most rain.

Kaziranga National Park, home to the largest population of Greater one-horned rhinos (Rhinoceros unicornis) in the world, sits on the southern banks of the mighty Brahmaputra River, which runs through Assam. In mid-July, a month after the first rains fell in Assam this year, the river burst its banks, inundating land on either side of its vast width. At the flood’s peak, as much as 95% of Kaziranga was underwater (up to a depth of 4.5 m), causing massive disturbance to the wildlife that calls the park home.

How does the monsoon impact Kaziranga?

By 1 August 2019, 91 people lost their lives and more than 3 million were displaced or otherwise affected by the flooding in Assam alone. Additionally, 220 large animals have died in Kaziranga as a result of the floods, including:

• 146 hog deer

• 13 sambar deer

• 20 wild boars

• 1 elephant

• 21 Greater one-horned rhinos (including 16 calves)

Whilst the flood sounds disastrous for people and wildlife alike, this annual phenomenon plays an important role in maintaining the balance of the local ecosystem. Firstly, when the river floods, rich alluvial soil is deposited on the grasslands surrounding the river. This adds vital nutrients to the land and, once the floodwaters have receded, will allow the grasses to flourish. Fresh growth benefits the Park’s large populations of herbivores, like rhinos and deer, by providing a renewed, plentiful food source. In turn, animals higher up the food chain, such as tigers, benefit too.

The flood also prevents the grasslands from becoming woodland. Without the floods, the grasslands would, over time, naturally convert to woods. This would be disastrous for the rhinos and many other species relying on this important grassland habitat.

Monsoon waters also tackle a newer threat facing the park. In recent years, the Park has had to deal with the spread of the invasive water hyacinth. This plant (originally from South America) outcompetes native flora, including the natural food plants of rhinos and other species, and clogs waterways, threatening the ecology of the Park. During the monsoon, the floods wash away the water hyacinth, giving native plants a chance to recolonise Kaziranga.

Another interesting effect of the floods is on animal populations as a whole. The animals that have died during the monsoon tend to be the weakest; those that are old, young, ill or injured. The floods are a mediator of natural selection: the strongest, fittest animals tend to survive. These animals can then continue to breed and produce the next generation, passing on the genes that made them so successful, meaning that future generations will be better adapted to cope with the floods.

Focusing on rhinos, although it is always incredibly sad to hear of rhinos dying, the number lost represents less than 1% of Kaziranga’s total population of Greater one-horned rhinos (yet this is more than the number of Assam’s total rhinos lost to poaching in a year (in 2017, only nine rhinos were killed by poachers in Assam State). However, this loss is unlikely to have a large negative impact on the population or its future growth, and Kaziranga will retain its status as the home of the largest population of Greater one-horned rhinos in the world.

However, whilst the floods are a natural, annual occurrence in Assam, their impacts on rhinos and wildlife can be exacerbated by human development. As roads, shops, restaurants and hotels have been built around Kaziranga, this has impacted the movement of wildlife, blocking their passage to higher land, where they would naturally retreat during floods. To try and redress the balance, conservationists in the Park have constructed artificial highlands to act as refuges for animals fleeing the rising waters. Some of the Park’s rhinos have been seen using these highlands, showing their importance as an alternative to natural refuge areas.

In some hopeful news, 72 animals have been rescued from the floodwaters, including five rhinos. They have received expert care, and many have already been released, giving them a second chance to thrive in the Park.

The rainy season will continue until October, but for now, the floodwaters have started to recede in Kaziranga National Park, taking the pressure off both the wildlife and people that call the area home.","Wed, 28 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://do67iyogspspf.cloudfront.net/prod/uploads/2018/04/Greater_One_Horned_Rhino_CreditRenaudFulconis.jpg,"['opportunity', 'wildlife', 'brings', 'kaziranga', 'floods', 'assam', 'animals', 'population', 'rhinos', 'river', 'assams', 'monsoon', 'danger', 'park']", ,flood

With waters receding, the flood crisis in Assam is showing signs of improvement. But 38-year-old Dalimi Kalita wades through her waterlogged courtyard in Chandrapur, about 30 km away from Guwahati, with a worried look.

Dalimi is concerned about the stinking, stagnant flood water - a possible breeding ground for diseases like the dreaded Japanese Encephalitis.

Her 6-year-old daughter is already running a fever.

""The government needs to give some medicines to pre-empt an outbreak. My child already has cold, fever and I am really worried,"" Dalimi told NDTV.

The floods have been a double blow for Assam. Death and destruction caused by the now receding waters have been compounded by the loss of lives due to the outbreak of Japanese Encephalitis since April.

At least 62 people have died of the floods in Assam but the Japanese Encephalitis outbreak has claimed more than 100 lives since April and Acute Encephalitis Syndrome or AES has killed about 200.

Since 2013, floods and Japanese Encephalitis outbreaks have gone hand in hand, killing over 1,000 people.

""Many people are in relief camps and they become vulnerable to communicable diseases and when the flood water recedes there is a threat of another outbreak of vector borne disease like dengue,"" Dr BC Bhagobati, state surveillance officer, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme of Assam said.

In areas that are still cut off like Laharighat in Morigaon district, health workers are finding it difficult to reach flood victims.

The government has cancelled the leaves of all doctors, paramedics and other health staff till September largely to tackle the Japanese Encephalitis outbreak but villagers say there is a lot more that needs to be done.

""Ever since the flood, my son has been very unwell. He has constant fever. Now, water is drying, this is the time when mosquitoes become active.

Five columns of the Army have so far been requisitioned and are assisting in the relief operations, another defence official said.

The Army is closely monitoring the flood situation in coordination with the civil administration, he said.

There are 152 monitoring stations for providing timely warning of an impending crisis due to floods, the official said.

The Army has alerted flood relief columns which consist of rescue and relief materials, to be prepared for deployment on short notice, he said.

Ninety-five flood relief columns along with additional 31 columns as reserve have been kept on stand-by, the official added.

Kaziranga National Park affected

With over 150 anti-poaching camps in Assam's Kaziranga National Park (KNP_ affected by the Assam floods, the authorities are working round-the-clock to check poaching at the UNESCO World Heritage site, officials said.

The staff and security personnel are performing their duties using mechanised and country boats to deal with any kind of eventualities, they said.

Earlier, a statement from the Assam Ministry of Forest and Environment said that ninety per cent of the Kaziranga National Park in Golaghat and Nagaon districts of the state was still submerged.

Besides forest guards, a State Disaster Relief Force (SDRF) team was engaged alongside Assam Police personnel in vulnerable spots of the park, Divisional Forest Officer, Kaziranga National Park (KNP), Rohini Ballab Saikia said

The press communique said 155 of the 199 anti-poaching camps at the KNP are affected by floodwaters.

The Kaziranga National Park is home to the world’s largest population of Indian one-horned rhinoceroses. Other animals such as tigers, elephants, sloth bears, monkeys and musk deer are also found in the forest.

Some of the animals have taken shelter in highlands within the park and many are migrating to the southern highlands of Karbi Anglong, crossing National Highway 37, the statement said.

Though 90 per cent of the KNP is submerged, the water level inside the park and the adjoining NH-37 has receded to some extent, restoring the movement of heavy vehicles on the highway on Tuesday.

However, passenger buses were not being allowed to drive through the park, Saikia said.

Till now, six accidents have been reported on the national highway, causing the death of five Hog Deer and a Sambar, the communique said.

Five other animals in the park are reported to have succumbed to injuries “for various reasons due to flood”, it said.

“Teams for rescue operation of distressed animal, as per necessity, are kept in readiness. The Special Rhino Protection Force is also deployed in vulnerable locations of the park,” the communique said.

Meanwhile, on the directions of Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, Minister of State for Environment and Forests Naba Kumar Doley has rushed to the park to oversee measures being taken to ensure the safety of wild animals, it said.

Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Head of Forest Force A M Singh visited several areas of the park to take stock of the situation.

(Express Photo) The Dhubri college, across the road from the jail, to where the prisoners were moved. (Express Photo)

The Deluge

The sight that greeted him at Dhubri District Jail on the night of July 15 could have belonged to the thrillers he used to watch as a teenager, says Deputy Superintendent of Police (HQ) Trinayan Bhuyan. “Except, this was no movie. This was real life.”

The rains had lashed continuously for a week and Dhubri town, like 80 per cent of Assam, was inundated. The floodwaters reached Bhuyan’s waist as he stood at the door to the jailor’s office. Inside, a few guards, clutching candles, looked helpless as waters swivelled just a few inches below the jailor’s desk.

“I told them, ‘Do something. Save the files, put them on top of the cabinet’,” says Bhuyan.

“Files? Forget the files. What about the inmates?” one of them shot back at him.

It was then that Bhuyan heard them. Behind, through the wall, there was a low thumping sound and cries of despair: “Save us. Let us out.”

There were 409 of them — men, women, and children — marooned in their cells. “And we had to get them out,” says Bhuyan, 36, who had joined his post in November 2018.

His boss, Superintendent of Police Shri Yuvraj, sent him a text: “Ho paayega (Can it be done)?” Bhuyan remembers being unsure. But he took the Almighty’s name and sent a text back: “Yes, Sir.”

The Transfer

Electricity had been out that entire day in Dhubri town. Earlier that morning, Jintu Borah, an Assam Civil Services officer posted with the district administration, had come to check on the jail. Established in 1965, it was housed in an old Assam-style bungalow and spread over 8 bighas. Within the premises lay a pond and a juvenile jail, which had been empty for years.

Borah had been the jail superintendent earlier, and knew the area well. “When I reached, the water level was just below my knee,” he recalls. “The kitchen had started flooding and the medical unit looked like it was about to.”

With the rain not letting up and the waters rising every hour, the 40-year-old began to work out alternative arrangements. He had heard that many years ago, in a similar episode of flooding, the inmates had been shifted to the District Library, 2 km away. Borah went to check on the library. “It was under water too. Plus, there were security concerns.”

Through the day, Borah waded through the waters, inspected other potential jails and made calls, before realising the answer lay right across the road: Dhubri Girls’ College (established in 1983), housed in a three-storied brick building with high walls and a big gate. “The verandahs too had grilles. And the college was closed for the summer. We had found our designated jail,” says Borah.

But it was already late evening, and before the transfer could begin, the administration had to give the college the form of a jail, turn classrooms into cells. Each floor had eight doors, all of which had to be padlocked, windows double-checked, two giant generators brought in, and entries and exits sealed. The work, including the construction of two bamboo watchtowers, would spill over to the next morning, with 15 workers on the job. “Imagine all of this in the middle of a storm, when practically the entire town was blacked out,” says Bhuyan.

When the transfer finally started at around 10 pm, the police and civil administration, nearly 50 of them in all, formed a human chain across the breadth of the road. Two registers were maintained — one at the original jail, the other at the designated one. One by one, as the handcuffed inmates were led across the road carrying the three things they would need the most, their blankets and a plate and bowl each, their names were jotted down — first on leaving, then on entering. Each prisoner was escorted by a guard each.

“We helped the elderly and sick carry their belongings,” says Bhuyan. Of the eight women prisoners, two had children with them, a two-year-old and a six-year-old. One of the police constables carried the baby in his arms as the mother, a short woman, had water up till her neck.

Bhuyan says that, all through, he and his colleagues had another fear: “Rescue in any case is tricky. But even then, never do you expect that the ones you are rescuing might make a run for it.”

While the policemen were armed, the rules didn’t allow shooting in case someone did try to flee. “That is because many prisoners are under trial and in for petty crimes. However, to ensure they didn’t try something like that, we scared them saying we would fire if anyone tried to run away,” says Bhuyan.

But the fear of nature proved stronger. The criminals, some of them hardened, accused of crimes ranging from theft to rape and murder, did as told. “It dawned on me that they did not want to run. Standing in water all day is a scary thought and all they wanted was to get to drier ground,” says Bhuyan.

As hours passed and the procession continued without incident, the authorities decided to let a guard handle up to four inmates each to speed things up. The transfer ended about eight hours later, at 5 the next morning.

However, just as Bhuyan and the team were about to take a break, a tally of the two registers showed that while 409 prisoners had checked out of the jail, only 408 had made it to the college. One prisoner was missing.

The alarm though proved shortlived. Two prisoners with the same name, Shukur Ali, had been noted down as one.

Almost immediately, the officials started getting the new jail into shape. With the ground floor flooded, the prisoners had to be accommodated on the first and second floors, and were told to make their beds with the blankets they had brought.

A kitchen was set up and the “biswashi” or trustworthy prisoners (usually the ones serving life term) roped in. Borah set up a WhatsApp group called ‘Designated Jail Management’, with officials across departments such as the Public Works Department, Assam Power Distribution Company, municipality, police etc.

“This was a way to keep everyone informed. Were the inmates eating? Was anyone sick? Did they need to go to a hospital? Was their electricity?” says Borah. Among those who had dropped in at night was Deputy Commissioner Anant Lal Gyani, and SP Yuvraj. “The thing is everyone, including the prisoners, saw how hard we were all working. That led them to cooperate,” Borah says.

Bhuyan decided to head out to other parts of the flood-hit town, reassured that his work at the district jail was done. But he woke up the next morning to what he had feared all along. A text informed him that an undertrial accused of rape, Hafizur, had escaped.

A ventilator with a broken iron rod on the first floor was suspected to have been the escape route, with Hafizur landing safely on the waters flooding the road below.

The Capture

Then started the hunt through a town that by now resembled a water park, says a local journalist, who did not wish to be named.

Police had little to go on except a photo of Hafizur taken 10 months ago when he was admitted to the jail. Bhuyan says there was no resemblance with that photo now. Plus the geography of Dhubri added to their worries — 40 km away is West Bengal, and 50-60 km by land the border to Bangladesh. “He could escape anywhere,” says Bhuyan.

Bus stations were alerted, railway stations checked, as the team scouted the route on foot, vehicles, even a boat, from Hafizur’s first wife’s house near Dhubri town to his second wife’s mother’s house in Dakshin Dharmashala. “We found that he had reached his second wife’s home the night after his escape. He had told her he was out on bail and that he was going to Delhi,” says Bhuyan. The wife gave police a number that ultimately led them to Rupchand, an ex-convict who Hafizur had made friends with in jail.

Sixty hours later, police found Hafizur sleeping in a house surrounded by water in Fakirganj in neighbouring Goalpara district.

On July 22, a week after they had been shifted, the 409 inmates returned to Dhubri District Jail. This time the transfer was smooth. The rain had abated, the waters receded, and the prisoners took a bus in broad daylight.

Things are slowly getting back to order. The jailor, who did not wish to be named, says, “The office is in a mess. Everything is ulat-palat. But at least the prisoners are back home.”

And that matters, Bhuyan says. “I realise Hafizur’s escape could have made a joke of our efforts. The fact that we had successfully transferred 400-plus people would have been forgotten. The media would only see that one person had escaped.”","Mon, 29 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/07/assam-floods-3.jpg,"['prisoners', 'water', 'college', 'dhubri', 'express', 'town', 'floods', 'assam', 'turned', 'bhuyan', 'transfer', 'road', 'inmates', 'jail', 'overnight']", ,flood

The North-eastern Indian state of Assam is naturally the most flood-prone state of the country as the monsoon winds blowing from Bay of Bengal hits the sub-Himalayan hills of Arunachal Pradesh to its north lashing the plains with heavy precipitation during the summer. According to the Rastriya Barh Ayog (RBA)—the National Flood Commission, 31.05 lakh hectares of the total 78.523 lakh hectares area of the state is prone to frequent floods. Secondly, the Brahmaputra—the lifeline of the state originates from a glacier at Tibet that carry additional amount of water due to snow-melt in the summer makes the entire valley flooded. There are reasons for the annual havoc of flood and river bank erosion affecting Assam annually, but one more phenomenon has been troubling the region. This is the increasing air pollution felt in the area in last few years.

The Brahmaputra factor:

The incessant rainfall during the monsoon and the very nature of the river Brahmaputra which is very dynamic as well as unstable at the same time are at the crux of the problem of flood in Assam. On its 580,000 sq km basin spreading over four countries—China, India, Bangladesh and Bhutan, with diverse environments, the Brahmaputra features among the world’s top five rivers in terms of discharge as well as the sediment it brings. At 19,830 cubic meters per second (cumec), it ranks fourth in discharge at the mouth, behind only the Amazon, the Congo and the Yangtze (Goswami, 2008).

By the time the river enters Assam it deposits vast amounts of this silt, leading to erosion and floods in the plains surrounded by hills. The Brahmaputra losses its velocity suddenly as it falls to a flat plain from a high slope making it to unload the sediments. The river’s channels prove inadequate amid this siltation, leading to floods. The massive earthquake of 1950 left the river to acquire a stable character rising its bed up considerably (highest two meters in Dibrugarh).

Moreover man-made factors like habitation, deforestation, population growth in catchment areas (including in China) have led to higher sedimentation creating temporary sandbars or river islands (locally called Chars) where people have been settling in in the last five decades or so. The sand bars or Chars restrict the space the river has to flow. As rainfall becomes heavy, it combines with all these factors and leads to destructive floods—annually.

Air pollution may be behind intense rainfall:

Research conducted by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur found a link between air pollution and intense rainfall recently. Analysing long-term satellite data between 2002 and 2016 and modelling to understand the association between aerosols and cloud properties, the study found that air pollution particles lead to change in the physical properties of monsoon clouds, which can lead to more intense rainfall, flash floods and unusual gaps in the progression of monsoon rainfall (Nature). “Not all extreme rain events can be linked to aerosols as other meteorological factors also play a role, but cases of extreme and erratic monsoon rainfall in inland areas affected by air pollution may be linked to this phenomenon,” says the study.

Aerosols, particularly black carbon and dust particles, induce “cloud invigoration”, which means cloud cover and thickness increases because of reduction in the size of cloud droplets and other structural modifications during cloud formation. Enhanced cloudiness reflects more sunlight back to space, leading to a cooling effect of the clouds’ surface. Apart from cooling, air pollution-induced cloud properties can also be linked to intense rainfall. It also facilitates thunderstorm-type clouds that have an umbrella type structure. This umbrella structure stops solar radiation and creates cooling, which causes a delay in the arrival of the next thunderstorm. This leads to episodes of intense rain followed by breaks in progression, the study say. Aerosols, whose main sources are fossil and bio-fuels combustion from residential and industrial sector, biomass burning absorb solar radiation, such as soot, cause these disturbances.

Air Pollution Makes Floods Worse

Air pollution can affects health and the World Health Organization estimates that it caused 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012 alone. But now another recent study shows that air pollution can trigger floods as well. In July 2013, heavy rainfall resulted in a catastrophic flood in Sichuan Basin, a mountainous area of China. Nearly 2.5 feet of rain fell in just five days which led to the findings that air quality played a role in the valley’s disaster. It was found that in some geographic regions, aerosols absorb heat from the sun, suppressing the chance of rain during the day and stabilizing the atmosphere. At night the warmed, rising air is transported to mountainous areas before it heads higher up into the atmosphere. This causes massive precipitation that can actually make flooding worse (Fan, J., et al. (2015).

Air pollution from soot and aerosol emissions is also making cyclones over the Middle East and South Asia more destructive. Natural differences in wind speed and direction over different heights in the atmosphere, known as 'wind shear', normally keep cyclones in check—effectively tearing the storms apart before they reach a certain size. But emissions from sources such as biomass burning and diesel vehicles have interfered with wind patterns, reducing wind shear and enabling cyclones to grow twice as intense, according to a study published in Nature last week (3 November). Cyclones that occurred between 1997 and 2010 were up to three times more intense than those between 1979 and 1996. It may be recalled that five of the strongest storms during the period occurred after 1998. Aerosol emissions in the region have also grown six-fold since the 1930s, creating a three kilometre-thick layer of pollution over the Indian Ocean, known as the South Asian atmospheric brown cloud, which absorbs sunlight, causing the ocean to cool and affecting wind circulation.

Air Pollution and flood in Assam:

According to a report by Pollution Control Board of Assam (PCBA) in 2015, Guwahati has one of the highest Black Carbon pollution levels in the world. The city’s PM2.5 concentration is more than eight times the WHO standards. Transport and dust are the primary contributors. It is due to the rapid urbanization and poor environment quality control in Guwahati which is giving rise to such high Black Carbon levels. Though Assam does not have heavy industries the entire state is moderately polluted in air. On July 21, 2019, leading doctors of Assam and other North-Eastern States join the movement for launch of Doctors for Clean Air—a campaign for raise awareness about the increasing air pollution and its health impacts in the region. Besides health risks, air pollution is the likely cause of abnormal monsoon and heavy rains and thunderstorms compounding the already existing flood problem of Assam.

In May this year, ahead of the onset of the monsoon at least 23 people lost their lives in storms and lightning strikes. The worst-hit districts are Golaghat, Sivasagar, Dhubri, Sontipur and Cachar. The two natural disasters have also affected around 22,801 families in 18 districts of the state in the current year (Assam State Disaster Management Authority-ASDMA). In May 11, 2018 eight people were killed and several others injured in lightning strikes and thunderstorms in the state. That time two people died in Karbi Anglong district and six others died in lower Assam’s Kamrup, Barpeta and Kokrajhar districts (ASDMA). According to ASDMA Project Officer Kripal Jyoti Mazumdar 64 people died due to lightning and storms till May that year. The spate of severe thunderstorms in these two early summers may be attributable to such aerosol-induced changes as found by IIT-Kanpur’s study and those in Sichuan Basin, China.

Pollutants reduction for flood mitigation:

The studies on atmospheric simulations in Sichuan Basin show that if current industrial emissions are reduced to a level before the China’s economic boom, less precipitation (up to 60% lower) could be predicted. This is due to weakening of the “aerosol-enhanced conditional instability” mechanism. This suggests that air pollutants reduction can effectively mitigated floods in that area. This discovery is also called “aerosol-enhanced conditional instability,” and its flipside is that reducing pollution in places like Sichuan can actually reduce floods. As pollution particles worsen flooding, it could help future weather forecasters predict floods.

In Guwahati industrial emission contributes only 5.29% of PM2.5 concentration in the air. The major contributor has been the transport (36.5%) and dust (27%). To reduce the presence of aerosols in the atmosphere vehicular emissions require a considerable control. A new and effective vehicle policy is very essential to mitigate the increased threat from flood caused by air pollution. Green technology in the transport sector, mostly the adoption of electric vehicles should be seriously considered to control the aerosol induced precipitation but also to make Assam a climate resilient state. Opting to public transport from private vehicles and shifting of public transport to electric power from fossil fuel could contribute effectively in achieving the desired goals to mitigate flood and climate change.

The statement came on a day floodwaters continued to submerge 12 districts of the state, affecting 5.18 lakh people. Breach of embankments has been seen as one of the prime reasons for people’s suffering during this flood.

“Altogether 5,18,623 people in 691 villages in 26 revenue circles of 12 districts — Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Darrang, Barpeta, Nalbari, Chirang, Kokrajhar, Goalpara, Kamrup, Morigaon, Nagaon, and Jorhat — have been affected by flood waters,” the Assam State Disaster Management Authority said in the evening. It added that water levels have shown a receding trend in all districts in the last 24 hours.”

While the overall flood situation improved in the state, heavy rain in Tinsukia district since Tuesday night brought back the threat of floods in the district’s low-lying and riverine rural areas and of waterlogging in the urban areas.

“Because of heavy rainfall in the past 24 hours, the Brahmaputra is showing a rising trend at Dholla, the Kundil at Chapakhowa, the Buri Dihing at Margherita, the Doomdooma at Doomdooma and the Tirap at Moulang,” an official at the Doomdooma subdivisional water resource office said in the evening.

“The Noa-Dehing is near the danger level at Chmoni,” Sudip Hazarika, a farmer of Sumoni Gaon, said.

The Brahmaputra is also flowing above the danger level at Neematighat in Jorhat and in Dhubri, the Dhansiri at Numaligarh in Golaghat and the Jia Bharali at NT Road crossing in Sonitpur.

Residents of Tinsukia town faced severe waterlogging on Wednesday, Digboi, Margherita, Doomdooma, Makum and Chapakhowa towns in the district were also affected.

The Goalpara water resources department is facing a tough time repairing embankments, damaged in over 15 places, as the ground water pours in with every dig of the spade, said assistant executive engineer Asad Hussain. No death due to floods has been reported in the past 24 hours. So far, 86 people have died in the floods.

Assam director-general of police Kuladhar Saikia contributed Rs 75 lakh to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund on behalf of Assam police on Wednesday. Hindustan Oil Exploration Company Ltd donated Rs 15 lakh, Assam Cricket Association Rs 5 lakh and Numaligarh Refinery Limited Employees’ Association Rs 23,22,130 to the fund.

A statement issued by the Assam Branch Indian Tea Association (Abita) said if the present situation prevails, the prospects of production in its tea estates may suffer a severe setback, which would have an impact on the overall annual production.

Abita has 275 member gardens, whose total production in 2018 was 246 million.

“High temperature, high intensity rainfall, less sunshine due to frequent overcast sky, has affected tea bush productivity with multiple cumulative short, medium and long-term effects on the tea bushes,” it said.

“The need of the hour is support from the government towards formulating a plan of action to prevent the recurring floods in the tea estates to ensure survival of the estates and employment of workers,” it added.

Incessant rain in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam has led to the Brahmaputra and almost all its tributaries being in spate affecting many Abita member tea gardens.

In Upper Assam’s Dibrugarh district, most of the tea sections, labour lines and roads in the Abita gardens of Maijan, Greenwood (Nagaholie division), Hazelbank (Oaklands), Balijan (N) and Mothola are flooded.

The worst affected gardens in Tinsukia district are Dinjan, Rungagora and Dhelakhat.

In Jorhat district, 140mm rainfall was recorded in July.

In Golaghat district, there are reports that flood-hit people of villages near Hathikuli tea estate and Kaziranga National Park have taken shelter in the garden school, crèche, hospital and other high lands in the estate.

The garden has provided drinking water to the flood-hit people and the outpatient department in the hospital has been kept open round-the-clock.

In Sonitpur district, several Abita member gardens have been affected by floods.

The river surrounding Mijicajan tea estate has cut into an embankment and washed away a part of the garden road and flooded tea areas.

Waterlogging in the tea-growing sections of New Purupbari, Monmohinipur, Nahorani, Rupajuli and Gingia tea estates have been reported. Floodwaters have entered the outskirts of Shakomoto tea estate and has flooded the labour lines. Erosion has been reported at Behupukri division of Monabarie tea estate and the Balijan river surrounding Bormahjan tea estate is flowing above the danger mark and may flood the garden areas any moment.

The association said waterlogging in labour lines and tea sections has been reported from Kopati tea estate in Darrang district, Budlapara, Corramore and Attareekhat gardens in Udalguri district and Ananda, Silonibari and Dejoo tea estates in Lakhimpur district.

A senior official of Amalgamated Plantations Private Limited, which owns Hathikuli, told The Telegraph: “Our hospital is open to all for emergency.

Three days of extremely high rainfall may have been the biggest factor in triggering the massive floods in Assam that that have already affected 57 lakh people, forced 1.51 lakh to relief camps and left 30 people dead this month.

Rainfall data shared by the Regional Meteorological Centre in Guwahati with NDTV reveals that Assam received 95 per cent more rain than normal on July 13 and 127 percent more on July 14. The excess rainfall sharply spiked on July 15 - by 224 per cent.

""While Arunachal Pradesh got 4 per cent more than normal, Assam and Meghalaya got normal rains and in other states, there is 13 per cent deficiency still. On 6th July, northeast had a rain deficit of 38 per cent. It rains heavily between 13th to 16th July,"" said SO Shaw, a top official at the Guwahati weather office.

On July 16, the water level of the Brahmaputra in Guwahati reached very close to its highest level of 51.46 meters recorded during the devastating floods of 2004.

""More of the major tributaries that contribute to the flood potential of the Brahmaputra as well as cause floods in their own catchment have reached peak flood level all almost at same time,"" said Parthajyoti Das, a Guwahati-based environment scientist.

The Assam State Disaster Management Authority also warned in a bulletin that the Brahmaputra and its tributaries are flowing above the danger mark in various places in the state, including in Guwahati.

However, since there has been no rain in the last 24 hours, flood waters have started receding in parts of upper and central Assam.

Hamida Khatun, 42, has never visited Kaziranga National Park (KNP), although it is some 900 metres behind her house in Harmoti, Assam. Her populous village adjoins the Bagori range of the wildlife preserve, best known as the address of the greater one-horned rhino.

On the evening of July 18, Khatun froze when she found a tiger by her home. So did the tiger. The tiger was some 10 ft away from Khatun, between her and a tube-well in the backyard to which she was headed to wash her plates. She clanged the steel plates to chase the animal away, and the tiger disappeared into the bushes.

The people of Harmoti are used to the odd deer taking refuge in their village during the annual floods in Kaziranga. But a tiger has never crossed their path in more than four decades. Nor has a rhino or elephant.

What happened after Khatun’s encounter was also unprecedented: angry villagers almost lynched Bagori Range Officer Pankaj Bora and other forest officials who had been trying to guide the animal back to the forest.

They were angry that the foresters had let the tiger lie all day inside scrap dealer Rafiqul Islam’s house. “They should have tranquillised the animal and taken it away instead of endangering our lives,” says Khatun’s 24-year-old son Hafizuddin Sheikh.

The villagers were in no mood to understand that tranquillising was not a good idea for an animal that was probably hungry and tired after having swum through a flood. “We think the tiger slipped into the hills of Karbi Anglong district in the dead of night when there was less traffic on the highway,” says Bora.

A 750 sq. km. stretch of hills in Karbi Anglong, south of NH 37, which runs along the southern periphery of KNP, has been the natural refuge for all animals when the park floods each monsoon. Unfortunately, commercial activities on or close to the animal corridors, especially along the 60 km stretch between Jakhalabandha and Bokakhat towns (on the western and eastern ends of KNP), have forced the animals to take unconventional monsoon migration paths over the years. Within the park, 144 artificial highlands were created for the animals, but they cover only 50 acres.

“Stone quarrying in Karbi Anglong over 15-16 years has virtually blocked some of the corridors, preventing animals from moving higher into the hills. This makes them vulnerable to poachers too,” says environment activist Rohit Choudhury, whose petition in the Supreme Court led to a ban on stone mining this April.

Follow the floods

This year, when forest officials followed a few animals, including rhinos and elephants, they found them foraging around the abandoned stone quarries; they also found tiger pug marks there, underlining the importance of leaving animal corridors alone.

While wildlife activists are encouraged by the fact that wildlife is returning to the areas around the quarries, they point out that the bigger picture is far from heartening. “Floods are necessary for Kaziranga even though they kill scores of animals every year. The park won’t survive without the floods — they replenish the wetlands and grasslands that the region’s flagship species, the rhino, is dependent on,” says N.K. Vasu, former Principal Chief Conservator of Forests. “The water, most importantly, helps drain out aquatic weeds that would otherwise choke the water bodies.” So clearly it’s not the flooding that’s the problem. The biggest problem, as Vasu says, is the “construction and increasing human presence along and around the highway.”

There are, for instance, scores of dhabas, restaurants and guesthouses on a 10 km stretch between the Bagori range office and the Burapahar range office. Many of these, allegedly without permits, came up after KNP was declared a tiger reserve in 2007. The scrap dealer’s shack, where the tiger rested on July 18, was one such structure. Local people say the area also has an illegal cement block-making unit in Najan near Harmoti, whose effluents flow into the Gelubeel water body. The walls built around these structures also hinder animal movement.

Bending rules

“These structures are beyond our jurisdiction. Ideally, the civil administration should intervene,” said a KNP official, speaking anonymously.

While officials of Golaghat and Nagaon districts, which Kaziranga straddles on the southern bank of the Brahmaputra, claim that no land has been bought in the vicinity of the park for more than a decade, local people say that the circle offices have been bending rules to let investors usurp land to expand hotels and other tourism-related activities. Dhabas, for example, have virtually turned into truck terminals.

River Diffolu, Kaziranga’s lifeline, has suffered because of contamination of some of its tributaries by stone mining in the hills. “Quarrying affects the water quality, impacting wildlife habitats in and around Kaziranga,” says a report by the Divisional Forest Officer of Eastern Assam wildlife division, which was sent to the national park director last June.

Much of Kaziranga’s existence, since it was made a ‘Proposed Reserve Forest’ in June 1905, has depended on the cooperation of people who live along its periphery. Over the years, villagers have tipped off park officials about poachers, and also volunteered to rescue animals during floods. They have also taken rare attacks by wild animals in their stride; a few years ago a wild buffalo that had escaped the flooded park injured a person in Silimkhowa village on the foothills of Karbi Anglong.

Which is why forest officials were taken aback by the anger in Harmoti this time. They attribute it to the anxiety among people living along Kaziranga’s periphery that they might lose lands and livelihoods if a 10-km Eco-Sensitive Zone (ESZ) is demarcated around the park, which would ban several activities.

ESZs are envisaged as ‘transition zones’ for wildlife moving from areas of high to low protection. In March this year, a Central Empowered Committee submitted to the Supreme Court a recommendation for an ESZ around Kaziranga as “some kind of shock absorber for the protected areas”. The next month, the Supreme Court asked the Assam government to respond to the recommendation.

“We are not opposed to the ESZ, but it cannot be 10 km everywhere around the park,” says Jitu Sarma Rajkhowa, president of Greater Kaziranga Human Resource Development and Environment Protection Committee. “Yes, we need environment protection, but we cannot let the people suffer. Villages have always existed 50-100 metres from KNP’s boundary. It will be a great injustice if they are shifted. Kaziranga sustains more than 5 lakh people.” .

Shrinking spaces

Deben Konwar of Jakhalabandha talks of the sacrifices made by local people for Kaziranga. “We were from Gotonga, a revenue village that was inundated by the Brahmaputra in 1969. We then moved to Kawoimari, which was acquired after Kaziranga became a national park in 1974. We moved again. Now we may be displaced again if an ESZ is established. Why should Kaziranga keep expanding and our space keep shrinking,” he asks.

But KNP director P. Sivakumar points out that Kaziranga is not expanding. “People usually talk about its core area, which is 430 sq. km., but the national park is 898 sq.km, and Kaziranga Tiger Reserve, demarcated in 2007, covers 1,080 sq. km.” Sivakumar says the ESZ need not be 10 km all around the park. “It can vary from zero to 10 km, depending on the level of sensitivity. There are stretches on the highway that animals do not use. We have no issues with commercial activities there. But areas along the nine animal corridors and about 50 dandis (paths) have to be protected.”

On June 27, at a meeting headed by Assam Chief Secretary Alok Kumar, following the Supreme Court’s direction of April, a suggestion was made about a possible relaxation of the ESZ width where necessary: “in areas of conflict the zero kilometre (boundary of KNP) limitation should be delineated and a minimum of 300/400 metres should be spared where there may be already existent public utilities/interest, government installations, building, etc,” the minutes of the meeting stated.

Assam forest Minister Parimal Suklabaidya says “We are yet to take a call on how wide the ESZ will be. The people will be taken into confidence to work out a formula that suits both humans and animals.”

Forest officials believe these fears have been fuelled by commercial stakeholders. “The ESZ protects villagers and agricultural lands and prescribes a ban on new commercial and industrial activities. We believe the hospitality lobby is behind this misinformation campaign,” says a senior forest official.

Communication gap

The Kuthari-Bagmari Eco-Development Committee is one of many such formed by the KNP authorities to involve villagers in conservation efforts. Its president Jayanta Rajkhowa points to a communication gap between foresters and the people. “Most people here are poor and subsist on agriculture. They don’t know what the changing status of Kaziranga from reserved forest to national park to World Heritage site and tiger reserve entails in terms of conservation.”

To address misconceptions, a meeting was held recently between Sivakumar and the people of Silimkhowa village, some 5 km south of the highway, facilitated by Pranab Bora of the World Wide Fund for Nature-India.

As Jonah Sing Engti of Silimkhowa explains, “Unlike commercial establishments along the highway, our houses have traditionally been spaced apart, so animals can pass through between them during floods. But the stone quarries not only came in their way, they have dried up five streams and damaged farmlands downstream. We are ensuring these quarries don’t come up again.”

Park officials know that Kaziranga needs tourists. But there are plans now to contain them within the centrally-located Kohora, the most popular halt for tourists, which is away from the animal corridors. Plans are also afoot to develop Bokakhat and Jakhalabandha towns as tourist hubs. A three-lane elevated highway in three stretches, totalling 35 km, has also been proposed to free up the nine animal corridors between the park and the hills.

“The world recognises Kaziranga as one of the best conservation stories of a century.

32,32,FL-2019-000084-IND,UNITED SIKHS HOST MEDICAL CAMP & CLOTHING DRIVE FOR FLOOD - GlobeNewswire,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/08/06/1898074/0/en/UNITED-SIKHS-HOST-MEDICAL-CAMP-CLOTHING-DRIVE-FOR-FLOOD-SURVIVORS.html,"ASSAM, INDIA, Aug. 06, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the death toll mounts to 91 this monsoon season, UNITED SIKHS continue to offer humanitarian relief for flood survivors, including a free medical camp. In coordination with the Army’s Sikh Regiment, UNITED SIKHS volunteers are providing free physician check-ups and medicine.



""The steady rain, receding waters and contaminated wells and drinking sources present the perfect storm for potential outbreaks,"" said Dr. Bhupender Kaur, UNITED SIKHS Volunteer. ""It is important to provide both preventative care and medicine to the flood survivors to help combat the spread of deadly diseases. We look forward to working with the Sikh Regiment to offer medical care free of charge to those in need.""



""Humanitarian work is crucial to save lives and must be carried out to all survivors in need, regardless of race, religion and ethnicity,"" said UNITED SIKHS CEO Jagdeep Singh. ""Service to all without discrimination is the ultimate manifestation of spiritual teachings and this is required today more than ever in the world.""



The medical camp joins UNITED SIKHS efforts already taking place on the ground, as the non-profit has been serving daily nutritious vegetarian meals, including rice, dal and vegetables, and providing shelter at their humanitarian relief camp at Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha. To date, volunteers have served fresh daily meals to more than 2,000 flood survivors every day since the disaster struck.



""It has been an honor to serve these communities in their time of need and demonstrate the impact of seva (selfless service),"" said Mohinderjit Singh, UNITED SIKHS Director. ""Through our commitment to uplift humanity in times of disaster, we are blessed to be able to work for the community and Gurdwara leadership to provide free medical care, food, shelter and clothing. This humanitarian crisis must be addressed on all fronts to help survivors in their long-term recovery.""



In addition to medical services and daily Langar (community meal service), UNITED SIKHS volunteers have launched a clothing drive, providing enough garments for 300 families. As personal belongings along with entire homes have been swept away with receding waters, the need for non-food relief items also remains paramount, including apparel, tarpaulin, bed sheets, blankets, mosquito nets, ropes and sleeping mats.



According to a bulletin released by the Assam State Disaster Management authority (ASDMA), 12.24 lakh people are affected by floods. The highest number of victims is in Barpeta (8.19 lakh), Morigaon (2.01 lakh) and Goalpara (over 1 lakh) districts. A total of 1,113 villages have been hit by floods.



Local drinking water sources, including open wells and hand pumps, have been contaminated and are unusable. Government officials reported that more than 1.7 million people in Assam have lost their homes. Nearly 2 million people have been displaced in nearby Bihar.



Assam has been facing dire floods since around July 10, when heavy monsoon rainfall caused the Brahmaputra River and many of its tributaries to flood, as reported by The Weather Channel. The rising waters inundated thousands of villages and displaced lakhs of people. More than 200 animals are reported dead at Kaziranga National Park.



On Monday, the Central Water Commission said the Brahmaputra River was flowing above the danger level at Neamatighat in Jorhat and Dhubri. The Dhansiri River was also above the danger mark at Numaligarh, the Jia Bharali in Sonitpur, and the Kushiyara at Karimganj.



As moderate rain and thundershowers is forecast over Assam and other parts of the northeast for the coming days, UNITED SIKHS is urging for public support and making a call for donations to aid humanitarian relief efforts. All contributions go directly to the organization’s Sikh Aid program.



""We can only do this life-saving work through the generous contributions of our supporters,"" said Gurvinder Singh, UNITED SIKHS Global Sikh Aid Director. ""We are grateful for all donations, however large or small. Flood survivors have lost everything -- every little bit goes extremely far in uplifting them on their road to recovery in the wake of such a large-scale disaster.""



For the latest updates on the ground situation, please follow UNITED SIKHS on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. All relief efforts are made possible due to the generous contributions of our donors and supporters. To donate, please visit: https://unitedsikhs.org/donate-in-india/.

Flood rescue workers are coming across residents who are not ready to be evacuated until they have their documents safe in hand, reports say.

The final National Register of Citizens will be published on July 31. Nearly 42 lakh people were excluded in earlier drafts, and this is presumably their last chance. If they are left out of the final list, they will have to face foreigners’ tribunals, quasi-judicial bodies while rule on matters of nationality. Those declared foreigners by the tribunals will be stripped of the rights and privileges of citizenship, and risk being detained or deported.

State officials were in the final stages of hearing claims and objections to earlier drafts when floods struck.

“There is huge flood water and strong current in the Brahmaputra,” Parvesh Kumar, a National Disaster Response Force worker in Morigaon district, told NDTV. “Water is entering the villages first and we are tasked with this challenging operation to evacuate people. When we go to bring them, almost everyone carries a bunch of papers: their NRC documents. People are ready to leave everything but not their NRC file.”

At least 17 people have died so far due to the floods, with 30 of 33 districts of Assam submerged, PTI reported. More than 45 lakh people from 4,620 villages were affected, and around 1.01 lakh people were taking refuge at 226 relief camps. Morigaon is among the worst-hit districts.

According to rescue worker Kailash Sharma, a villager in Laharighat began “crying inconsolably” as he had left behind his NRC documents while being evacuated. “We sent our diver and he got the bunch of documents which was in the plastic pouch,” Sharma told NDTV.

Some flood-hit families are reluctant to even move out. According to The Indian Express, home and land will prove to be tangible markers of identity while proving citizenship. “This could be one of the reasons that they feel so scared to leave their homes,” an unidentified official from the local administration said.

Parvesh Kumar told The Indian Express that the families who agree to be rescued ensure that their documents are safe with them. “So many times, we brought them to safety, only to go back again because they realise they have forgotten their documents,” he said.

Samsul Alam of Mahmari village in Morigaon was rescued along with his 100-year-old mother, wife and children – along with his NRC documents. He told NDTV: “We somehow survived, we kept floating on a banana trunk, [didn’t] have anything to eat for two days. This flood has taken away my home, my land and my livelihood, but I am happy I have the most precious [things] with me – my mother, wife and children and NRC document. Without them, I would be stateless.”

Authorities conducting the claims and objections are also facing problems. “The overflowing rivers have submerged the low-lying areas and it has become difficult for us to communicate with those villages,” Satyali Biswas, assistant circle officer in Bhuragaon, told Time8. “The NRC Seva Kendras, hearing centres and documents are safe. It is the claimants’ villages which are reeling under flood waters.”

The stated aim of the National Register of Citizens is to distinguish genuine Indian citizens from undocumented immigrants living in the state. According to the terms, anyone who cannot prove that they or their ancestors entered Assam before midnight on March 24, 1971, will be declared a foreigner.

Seventy per cent of the Kaziranga National Park and its 95 camps have been submerged in water owing to the devastating floods in Assam.

To this end, forest officers have been asked to remain on duty and their leaves stand cancelled.

Kaziranga National Park in Assam is home to the world's largest population of Indian one-horned rhinoceroses. Other animals like tigers and elephants are also found in the forest.

The excessive rainfall in the state has also led to flooding on the National Highway-37, throwing the normal life out of gear. This highway starts from Sutarakandi near Karimganj in Assam and terminates at Bhali in Manipur.

The MPs of the state have demanded that the Assam floods should be declared national calamity. To this end, Assam Congress MPs protested in front of Gandhi statue in Parliament over flood situation in the state.

Meanwhile, more than 26 lakh people have been displaced from their homes and flash floods have killed at least nine in the past 72 hours.

According to the Indian Meteorology Department (IMD), there is a likelihood of more rainfall in the state in the next 48 hours.

The flood situation in Dhemaji and Lakhimpur remains the worst where most of the people have been affected. Several houses, roads and bridges have also been damaged after breach of embankments led to flooding in many areas.

The incessant rains have also affected the movement of trains in Assam and the Northeast Frontier Railway suspended train movement on the Lumding-Badarpur Hill section cutting off five states including Tripura, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Meghalaya from the country's railway map till July 16.

Pictures of rescue operations of flood victims in Assam are viral on social media. But there are a few unrelated images which have been passed off as pictures of the Assam flood.

Recently, a picture of a man with a calf on his shoulder wading through knee-deep water has gone viral, linking it to the Assam floods.

""Humanity. Pray for Assam"" is the caption written in English on the viral image posted on Facebook by user, ""Are bhai bhai bhai"".

The archived version of the post is here.

The picture was posted on Facebook on July 19, 2019 and has been shared by more than 4,000 users till the time of writing this article.

India Today Anti Fake News War room (AFWA) found this to be a misleading claim.

The viral image is not from Assam. The viral image has been widely used by news media in Bangladesh recently to report on the flood in the neighbouring country.

Several other Facebook pages like ""Namo Bharath - Narendra Modi For PM"" and ""Bakchod page"" also posted the same content on July 19, 2019.

Simple reverse image search on the viral picture throws up several Bangladeshi news portals which have carried this image in their stories related to flood in that particular region.

Dhaka Times used this picture in their article published on July 18, 2019 regarding the flood situation of Gaibandha area in Northern Bangladesh.

Other Bangladeshi websites like Bangladesh Journal and PBA also used the same picture recently in their stories on Bangladesh flood. But none of them has mentioned the exact location of the picture.

AFWA has not found this viral picture in any credible mainstream media website in India which are reporting on Assam flood situation, other than the social media platforms.

We have contacted news websites of Bangladesh who have carried this picture to know the exact location from where the photograph was taken. We will update our article as soon as we get any response from these websites.

It has been reported widely on mainstream and social media that many people have braved flood water to rescue trapped animals in Assam, but this particular viral image of a man rescuing a calf by carrying it on his shoulder is not from Assam.

36,36,FL-2019-000084-IND,Assam Flood Creates Havoc: 40K Crore Express Highway Project Gets Stuck - The Logical Indian,https://thelogicalindian.com/news/assam-flood-results-havoc/,"In the year 2017, the central government announced the first-ever express highway project in the northeast region to be built along the Brahmaputra River in Assam at an estimated investment of Rs 40,000 crore.

“Northeast is our priority. We are going to develop the first express highway of the North East in Assam along the banks of Brahmaputra. This 1,300 km-long express highway is likely to incur an investment of Rs 40,000 crore,” Nitin Gadkari had said while announcing the project.

He further said,” The land acquisition has to be done by the state. The sand the soil coming from the dredging of Brahmaputra will be utilized for construction of the road. The express highway will be axis-controlled and vehicles will be able to ply at very high speed. The Centre will dredge a stretch of 891km of the Brahmaputra River from Sadia in Upper Assam to increase navigational channels up to Chittagong port in Bangladesh.”

The Assam government had finalized the tenders for the project to execute the plan from this year. However, that was stalled due to incessant and devastating floods that caused 75 deaths and affected 39 lakh people in the 20 districts of Assam. According to the reports, the damage was caused as the water in the dams uphills was released. The encroachment of forest lands and water bodies are said to be other reasons behind the floods that ravage the state almost every year.

People of Assam are upset as the problem of the flood is an annual occurrence, yet it is being neglected by both the central and the state government from many years. This time the locals of the affected districts came out asking the government to bring long term solution.

According to an analysis by the Rashtriya Barh Ayog (RBA), 39.58 per cent of the total land area of Assam is flood-prone as the state and the other parts of the North-Eastern region fall in a seismic zone. Frequent earthquakes and landslides carry debris into the rivers which in turn rise riverbeds.

Guwahati: Most in the Bhawraguri village of Kokrajhar, about 190km from here, had taken a chance and made their way out of the flooded hamlet on banana rafts. It's dangerous, exhausting and barely a guarantee for safety. Nirmali Ray, 60, decided to wait it out. And it helped.

Within 24 hours since Wednesday, the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) sprung into action and rescued her and more than 3,000 others like her.

""The weather suddenly turned favourable. We wasted no time. Rescue operations were conducted in full swing in Kokrajhar district. People stranded in their houses - mostly older people, women and children - are being evacuated,"" said Rajib Kalita, an SDRF personnel deployed in the rescue operations.

Besides SDRF, the National Disaster Response Force and the Army have been at work across flooded Assam .

""At least 100 rescue boats were deployed in the flood-affected districts of lower Assam. In Kokrajhar district alone, some 1056 persons were rescued since Wednesday. Some six boats of SDRF, NDRF and state fire and emergency service were working round the clock in Kokrajhar district,"" a report released by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority said.

On Wednesday alone, around 2,026 persons were evacuated across the state.

Official figures also highlighted that on Thursday alone, some 1,072 people were rescued from various locations of Baksa, Nalbari, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, Dhubri and Morigaon district.

The highest number of people were rescued in Kokrajhar district (459), followed by Nalbari (271).

According to the latest report of the Central Water Commission (CWC), rivers like the Manas, Beki and Gaurang were flowing in the severe flood situation in the districts of Baksa, Kamrup, Nalbari, Barpeta, Kokrajhar and Dhubri.

The situation will continue in severe to above normal flood for the next two to three days, the CWC said.

Till now, 833 relief camps are operational in 13 districts - Baksa, Nalbari, Barpeta, Chirang, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, Dhubri, Goalpara, Kamrup, Morigaon, Nagaon, Golaghat and Jorhat . Besides, 102 relief distribution centres have been set up in Lakhimpur, Darrang, Barpeta, Kokrajhar, Kamrup, Morigaon and Sivasagar districts.

Five rivers continue to flow in spate - the Brahmaputra at Nematighat and Dhubri, the Jia Bharali at NT Road Crossing in Sonitpur, the Puthimari at NH Road Crossing in Kamrup, the Manas at NH Road Crossing in Barpeta and the Beki at Road Bridge in Barpeta.

GUWAHATI: Fancy Bazar, Machkhowa and their adjacent areas in Guwahati are vulnerable with the fragile MG Road at Fancy Bazar has to directly break waves of the surging Brahmaputra. This has happened as the river bank has been submerged in this stretch. Will the road remain in shape if such powerful waves continue to strike it directly? The authorities can ill-afford to do something tangible.

The Water Resources Department has stockpiled sand-filled sacs at some fragile stretches of MG Road – at Guwahati-Madhyam Khanda Ferry Ghat and its adjacent areas – to keep the threat from the powerful waves striking the road at bay. However, it seems, the measure isn’t strong enough to keep the fragile road in shape. In the event of the MG Road giving in to the relentless pressure from successive waves, the entire Fancy Bazar and Machkhowa areas may come under the grip of floods, and this may happen anytime.

This is not all. A number of parks and other installations on the bank of the Brahmaputra in this stretch from Sukreswar Temple to Bharalumukh are under water. They are Sankardev Udyan, Azan Peer Udyan, Bhagawan Mahabir Udyan, Guwahati-Kasomari Ghat and Guwahati-Madhyam Khanda Ghat. With the sluice gate of the Bharalumukh closed, the surging waves of the mighty river have wreaked havoc in areas like Santipur. Sonaram HS School, the back side of the Bharalumukh police station and a section of Pandu Ghat are well under water.

The situation is no better either in other areas in Guwahati. Uzan Bazar; Nuapara in Satgaon; Tinitukura, Panikhaiti, Begnenamari, Tamulbari, Kherbari, Amgaon, Rajabari etc in Panikhai Gaon Panchayat have been inundated. Tantipara, Singimari, Panbari, Thakurkuchi etc in Chandrapur gaon panchayat have also been under water. The worst is that many fresh areas are being inundated in all these areas.

Only the tip of the Lakshmi-Narayan Statue in Aanta Shajya of Baba Chakreswar Temple at Kalipur on the bank of the Brahmaputra is visible.

What’s worrisome is – at 5 pm on Tuesday the river was flowing at 1.55 m above the danger level at Guwahati. The water level was at 51.16 m at 6 am, at 51.17 m at 10 am, at 51.20 m at 1 pm, at 51.21 m at 2 pm and at 51.23 m at 5 pm.

According to a flood report issued by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority on Tuesday for Kamrup(M) district, five villages in Guwahati Revenue Circle, 19 villages in Sonapur Revenue Circle, 26 villages in Chandrapur Revenue Circle, four villages in Azara Revenue Circle and one village in Dispur Revenue Circle have been reeling under floods. The total population affected in the district is 56,368.

Calling it a “heart-breaking” situation, actor Akshay Kumar was among the first to donate Rs 2 crore for the same. The actor gave a crore each towards the Assam Chief Minister’s Relief Fund, and for the rescue work in Kaziranga National Park.

“Honestly, jab maine paise diye, I didn’t feel good. But I felt really good when I got a call from the Assam Chief Minister (Sarbananda Sonowal), who told me that, ‘aapke donation ke baad, bahut saare aur bhi logon ne donation diya.’ That made me happy. I really feel that our nation is an amazing one. If there’s ever any problem, you just have to start something and then there’s a ripple effect. You know, when I worked on ‘Bharat Ke Veer’ app, you can’t imagine how many people made donations. India is a large-hearted nation. We just need a little push,” says the actor.

Recently, an Assamese singer, Bornalee Deuri thanked Akshay on the Kapil Sharma Show for his donation. Says Akshay: “One of the images that really affected me was of a mother holding her baby on her shoulders and wading through the flood waters. There was no expression of sadness or stress on her face. And that’s a dangerous sign. What all she must have gone through that she forgot all her sorrows. When I come across such photos, I am like, ‘it can happen to my wife or my daughter.’ Aisi photos bahut choobhtin hai. That’s why I did what I did,” he says.

Animals’ plight, too, has “moved” Akshay. “I also saw some images of animals like rhinoceros, who were drowning, dying and screaming. We should all come together during such times – regardless of whether you can donate Rs 2 or 5 lakhs. That’s how a country is made. And humanity is all about that. I admit that God has given me a lot of money, so I give away without thinking twice. Kahaan leke jaane hai paise,” he wraps up.

Work-wise, Akshay – whose latest film, Mission Mangal has crossed Rs 100 crore mark In India today – has an envious line-up ahead – Housefull 4, Good News, Sooryavanshi, Laxmmi Bomb and Bachchan Pandey followed by Prithviraj Chauhan. “See, agar yeh films chal gayi toh [line-up] accha hai. Otherwise, koi kucch nahi kar sakta with any sort of line-up of films. You know, a great man had once said, ‘you will keep going up and down, and down and up in life.’ So, it’s all good, as long as I enjoy the journey,” says the actor.

Immediately, a highly trained and well-equipped Flood relief column of the Indian Army was mobilized and arrived at the Balitara Village in Nalbari District to undertake a massive humanitarian aid and disaster relief operation.

“Operating under heavy downpour, dangerous currents and alarming water levels in addition to the pitch-dark night, Indian Army toiled hard and ensured to rescue 150 stranded civilians, including 60 women and children, and brought them to safe zone.

GUWAHATI: With 22 embankments already breached in this year’s second spate of floods, the State Water Resources Department is gearing up to tackle the situation for the remaining portion of the monsoon season. Official sources said that 29 embankments were breached during the last year.

The original budgetary allocation for the department during 2019-20 is Rs 125 crore under Flood Management Programme (FMP). However, considering the damage that have already taken place, the Department has drawn up an additional estimate of Rs 80.24 crore for the financial year 2019-20 under FMP wherein works are undertaken for repair and strengthening of the existing embankments. Of the estimated amount, while Rs 63.63 crore has been earmarked for the Brahmaputra valley, Rs 16.61 crore is for the Barak valley.

On Tuesday morning itself, the CC Bund at Number 2 Borghuli area in Kaliabor Legislative Assembly Constituency got breached due to erosion by the Brahmaputra. Though water did not flow through it as the water level of the river was below the height of the bund yet there is all the likelihood of water surging in through the almost 50 metre breached portion once the water level rises. Water Resources Minister Keshab Mahanta visited the site and took stock of the situation during the day.

Meanwhile, Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has already asked the departments concerned to submit their estimates of additional fund requirement for taking up various flood-damage repair related works to be placed for Supplementary Demands during the forthcoming Assembly session from July 26.

The other image was shot during the 2016 floods in Andhra Pradesh. Here, a desperate father was carrying his sick baby on his head through deep floodwaters to reach the nearest hospital in the state. “Pangi Satibabu, 30, a farmer, from Kudumusare village in Andhra Pradesh, carried his six-month-old daughter above his head for three miles to the nearest health centre after heavy rainfall led to a deluge.”, stated an article published by Daily Mail on September 29, 2016.

The massive downpour in the north-eastern state has led to terrifying floods; the uncontrollable overflow of the Brahmaputra river has inundated National Highway 37, affected over 200 villages in Morigaon district, and damaged more than 90 per cent of Kaziranga National Park. Over a hundred National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) troops have been deployed in flood-affected areas of the country, with 14 being deployed in Assam’s Barpeta, Biswanath, Chariali, Dhemaji, Guwahati, Jorhat, Sivasagar and other areas. Ferry services to Umananda Devaloi Temple, located at Peacock Island in the middle of river Brahmaputra, were halted on Monday, leaving people stranded.

As the apparition of flood ruthlessly lashes vast swathes of Assam, it is yet another parade of blatant obliteration, dismantling whatever little semblance of menschiness the dogged populace managed to stitch together in the face of inexorable adversity. The situation continues to remain grim with no tangible solution in sight. It’s an unfortunate situation for one simple reason that occurrence of flood in Assam is a perennial phenomenon and it lays bare our utter lack of preparedness and a flippant comportment to effectively cope with the situation. The sheer enormity of the current bout of flood has tousled 4.5 million people residing in various parts of Assam, their lives thrown off gear in numerous ways. So many people have been pushed to a life of perpetual poverty, daunted and exasperated by this vicious cycle that they try so hard to extricate themselves from. Such pernicious episode of flooding brings with it a litany of encumbrances which menacingly eviscerate the affected people in ways that they meekly surrender to the inevitability of the crisis. Scores of people are rendered homeless, their fragility further compounded by an increasing susceptibility to various infectious diseases that follows such a crisis. Agriculture has been persistently assailed by recurrent floods destroying standing crops, decreasing the fertility of the soil and also resulting in soil erosion. This is a huge blow to the economic stability of the farmers, whose livelihoods largely depend on agricultural activities. Animal husbandry is usually the buffer that has been effective in alleviating the economic shocks that farmers are prone to in the event of large-scale crop failure. The tyranny of this flood has been so sepulchral and unsparing that livestock has been hugely hit and has led to deaths of a large number of animals. This has come as a double whammy for the farming community in one of the hardest-hit flood situations that Assam has ever experienced.

The damage wrought by this flood to the Kagiranga National Park has been so humongous and damaging that it is going to take us a long time to recover completely from the situation. According to officials data, a total of 187 animals, including 15 one-horned rhinos, 3 elephants and over 300 deer have perished in this ruthless inundation. These numbers are significant and dismaying enough to make everyone sit up and take serious notice. Veterinarians have been scrambled to aid in the rescue efforts but given the scale of damage inflicted by this deluge, it is going to take a lot of elbow grease to get anywhere around to containing the situation. Both medical and veterinary camps have been organized in several flood-affected places to ensure that proper mechanisms are in place to stymie the occurrence of disease outbreak. The Indian army has been steadfast in performing evacuation and rehabilitation programmes. They have been instrumental in getting medical camps organized in many flood-affected areas. In some districts, boat clinics are also being used to provide much needed medical aid to the flood-affected people. In places like Goroimari, in close vicinity to the Orang National Park, such boat camps have become an instant hit and a throng of people have visited these boat clinics to get medical aid. Boats are also being used to organize veterinary camps, particularly in areas that have been totally inaccessible via roads. There is a heightened need to keep an eye out for any outbreak of infectious diseases as the given situations are now highly conducive to rapid spread of diseases. The veterinarians from across the State have been stretched thin to cover the large tracts of land that remain submerged in water and provide necessary aid to the people in need. The paucity of veterinarians has been accentuated by the tearing hurry to engage sufficient manpower at different places in this time of crisis. There is a need for greater preparedness apropos the timely evacuation, proper rehabilitation, and access to food, clothing and medicines for flood affected people.

The situation is very grave and it requires much greater attention and awareness at a national level to surmount the crisis. The national media coverage has been largely inadequate and leaves much to be desired. There is a need to make the required noises to get our concerns heard. Social media should be extensively used to highlight the plight of people enduring prolonged periods of inundation. Contributions made to the chief minister relief fund would help a great deal to bring the situation under control. A collective approach and a concerted effort both on the part of government and the general public would go a long way in ameliorating the crippling situation of flood that Assam is currently confronted with.","Mon, 05 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sentinelassam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Assam-flood-Reu-1-1-1.jpg,"['flood', 'crisis', 'veterinarians', 'assam', 'national', 'ramifications', 'need', 'aid', 'situation', 'camps', 'farreaching', 'medical']", ,flood

With the onset of the monsoon, nearly 10,000 people in five districts of Assam have been hit by the first wave of floods.

The Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) said floods have hit Dhemaji, Chirang, Nalbari, Jorhat and Dibrugarh districts, with the highest number of people (7,000) being affected in Dibrugarh.

The ASDMA’s daily flood report on Friday said 906 people are living in relief camps, 723 in Chirang and 183 in Jorhat, and the government has distributed 102 quintals of rice, 18 quintals of dal and five quintals of salt among the flood-affected people.

The floods have washed away portions of roads, embankments, culverts and bridges, triggered erosion, which has rendered people homeless, and destroyed farm land.

Other districts in lower and Upper Assam have also been affected.

In Barpeta, floods washed away a portion of Hudukhata Naosali Road, which serves as an embankment to the Kaldia river, under Sarupathar revenue circle and a portion of the river’s embankment under Sarthebari revenue circle, among others.

In Bongaigaon district, portions of two embankments were washed away and a road was damaged.

It has also killed over 200 animals, including 16 endangered rhinos in Kaziranga National Park, and led to the Brahmaputra and Baghmati rivers flowing above danger marks.

""The political will is always important. The representation of the people who are suffering must take it up with the centre. It is a sad situation that an actor in Mumbai is representing them,"" a clearly emotional Mr Bajpayee said.

The recent floods in Assam, which claimed over 60 lives, also rendered a vast swathe of agricultural land infertile by covering them with several feet of sand.

Assam agriculture minister Atul Bora told reporters on Tuesday that the recent floods buried 2,536 hectares of land under sand and damaged 2.14 lakh hectares of paddy field.

Agricultural land covered by sand is a farmer’s worst nightmare because of its prolonged effect.

A farmer of Mesaki Sapori in Upper Assam’s Dhemaji district told a local news channel on Tuesday that he was unable to find the boundary of his agricultural land as it was buried under three feet of sand from the Lali river which flows through the district.

Despite the damage, Bora hoped that the state would achieve its target of producing 67 lakh metric tonnes of paddy this year. “Many farmers were relieved because of the community nurseries we have set up for producing paddy seeds. They could use the paddy seeds after floods damaged their crops,” he said.

Bora said the production of agricultural items had gone up in the state between 2014-15 and 2016-17. He said 17.25 lakh soil health cards have been distributed among farmers from 2015-16 till August 15 this year. “Another 1.12 lakh soil health cards are ready for distribution,” he added.

The minister said the agriculture department will set up 19 soil-testing laboratories in addition to the existing nine to make more farmers aware of suitable cultivation for their land.

Assam is facing a serious crisis as floods in the state have already claimed at least 15 lives and affected around 43 lakh. Scores of cattle and animals at Kaziranga National Park have also been killed in the disaster.

However, Priyanka, who is the brand ambassador of Assam tourism, has not made any tweet or comment on the ongoing havoc. Priyanka has been making several posts on social media, the latest being on promoting a beauty campaign, but she has not made any tweet expressing concern for the people in Assam or urging people to raise relief fund.

This apparent indifferent attitude of the popular actress has been raising eyebrows. Scores of people have been expressing disappointment at Priyanka being absolutely silent on Assam floods.

A lot of them have also been tweeting to Priyanka, requesting her to talk about it and urge people to help the state. Many others are highly miffed at PeeCee's apparent apathy towards the current condition of Assam and its people.

""You are the brand Ambassador for 'Awesome Assam ' Do u have any idea what is happening in Assam now? 90% of #Kaziranga is under water. Over 30 lacs people affacted by #FloodinAssam . We r losing beautiful animals. We need ur support to declare #FloodinAssam as national disaster,"" one person tweeted.

""Dear Priyanka Chopra In case you have forgotten, you are also the Brand Ambassador of Assam Tourism. A state submerged in flood right now. Where is your concern, your tweet creating awareness and asking people to extend help for them? Shame on you,"" wrote another.

Numerous such angry tweets are being made tagging Priyanka, but no response came from the actress as of now.

At Goroimari, the char (riverine island) close to the Orang National Park in Morigaon district, they eagerly waited for the boat clinic with two doctors to arrive on Monday morning.

“There was chest-deep water for a few days and I could not go to the market to fetch medicines,” Jamila, who gave only her first name, said.

As the boat anchored in Goroimari, a crowd of mostly women and children waited anxiously as the local ASHA worker helped unload the medical supplies.

Within minutes, the clinic was ready as desks were laid and occupied by two doctors, a laboratory technician among other staff and tarpaulin sheets pulled out to cover from the drizzle. The crowd then moved to a tractor, where OPD slips were issued to them and a flyer in Assamese about steps to prevent diarrhoea.

The boat clinic is the most reliable health facility, which visits once every month, for more than 900 residents of Goroimari and more than 17,000 others in 29 more riverine islands in Morigaon district.

“We used to cater to around 30,000 people but many of the riverine islands have disappeared in the river in the last few years forcing people to move to the mainland,” said Shyamjit Pashi, the district programme officer of the boat clinic facility.

The clinics are needed more during floods, when diarrhoea, trench foot and fever among other ailments are common.

“It was on June 11, when this boat clinic came here that I got my last supply of medicines. I don’t have the money to go to town and during floods it was impossible,” said Jamila.

As on Monday, the death toll due to the floods increased to 69 as two more people died even as more than three million continued to be marooned in 18 districts of Assam, down from 30 of the 33 districts a week ago.

“We have done 10 camps and treated over 800 people since July 12 when the flood situation became severe,” young medical officer Digjam Sarma, who is one of the two doctors on the boat clinic, said as he attended to the long queue of patients at Goroimari.

On the next desk, the pharmacist handed them medicines as per their prescriptions.

Mukhtar Hussain, 37, a farmer, said he visited a pharmacy in the nearest town Moirabari, a one-and-a-half-hours away in a boat, as all of his seven family members including him fell ill with fever and other ailments in the floods. He spent Rs 2,000 on medicines yet the family continued to suffer. He came to the boat clinic hoping for relief.

“We give them free medicine and checkup unlike the private pharmacy,” said Ashraful Islam, the second doctor.

Islam rued that the long queue of people will mean his inability to give enough time to each patient. He explained that during floods, the boat clinics suspend their normal immunisation and awareness programme to look after those affected. In Goroimari, however, the immunisation drive was conducted.

Ashok Rao, programme manager of the boat clinic programme started by C-NES before the National Health Mission pitched in to support it, explained how the work for these clinics has increased during this season with the government using them for relief.

“In some districts, the government is using our boats to even organise veterinary camps,” Rao said.

He also said the government has also augmented the manpower with more doctors and support staff to attend to maximum patients.

The programme runs 15 boat clinics in 13 districts of Assam catering to more than 3,00,000 people inhabiting the riverine islands.","Tue, 23 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2019/07/23/Pictures/_4e9be6d4-ad12-11e9-8ce3-2af94b9ec815.jpg,"['boat', 'bring', 'medicines', 'clinic', 'goroimari', 'floodhit', 'doctors', 'districts', 'assam', 'floods', 'riverine', 'clinics', 'programme', 'respite']", ,flood

(Source: /YouTube) Watch how Abhineet Mishra sends a serious message about the Assam floods. (Source: /YouTube)

There was little to laugh about in the comedy set Mumbai-based Abhineet Mishra did earlier in January this year. Yet the video — on the plight of 15 miners trapped in an illegal rat-hole mine in Meghalaya — went viral. “Comedy means telling jokes, but it also means you take a stand on things,” said the 31-year-old HR professional, who is a comedian by hobby.

On Tuesday, Mishra used his favourite hobby to take a stand again — this time on the devastating floods across the Northeast, particularly Assam.

According to the latest reports, more than 52 lakh have been affected in almost all 33 districts of the state.

“But you guys don’t know about it, right? The media has better things to do.” says Mishra, in the eight-minute long clip.

Like the Meghalaya miners video, Mishra’s new set isn’t performed in front of a live audience either — at the end of the clip, the viewer discovers that the comedian has been addressing an empty room all along.

“Entire districts have been marooned, homes have been swallowed up — but is anyone listening? Do we have the same hashtags as we did for Chennai and Kerala? No, we do not,” said Mishra to indianexpress.com, describing his act as a “symbolic action” to highlight how lakhs of people are suffering in silence.

Growing up in Meghalaya’s Shillong, Mishra feels that the Northeastern states might have numerous stories to tell, but no audience who really wants to hear them. “Why would the jokes from the Northeast be relatable when the entire region is unrelateable?” he asks in the video, which has already garnered more than ten thousand views on YouTube in the past 24 hours.

While Mishra uses dry wit to drive home a few points (“People in Mumbai say ‘My house has a swimming pool.’ So, what’s the big deal, I tell them. ‘Come to Assam during June to August, swimming pools have houses’.”), he ultimately wants to send out one serious message: “Get your act together” he tells the media and politicians.

The video, titled Staying Afloat, was shot in a cafe in Shillong where Mishra is currently visiting his family. Next week, he will do a few comedy shows around Assam. “There’s hardly any preparation that goes into these videos. For example, both the videos were written, performed and uploaded within a span of few hours,” said Mishra, “It’s not like I plan these — if I feel for it, I just do it.”","Wed, 17 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/04/abhineet-mishra-northeast_759.jpg,"['mishra', 'youtube', 'video', 'abhineet', 'message', 'floods', 'assam', 'serious', 'watch', 'comedian', 'comedy', 'joke']", ,flood

Church groups in India’s Assam state have stepped up their humanitarian efforts after catastrophic floods wreaked havoc, leaving 15 people dead and an estimated 4.6 million homeless.

More than 4,157 villages in 30 districts are submerged in the northeastern state as rains continue unabated, raising the water level of the Brahmaputra River above the danger level.

At least 15 people are reported to have been killed in flash floods and landslides, according to government figures. More than 83,000 have been evacuated to 200 relief camps, run in collaboration with non-governmental agencies.

Father Varghese Velickakam, convener of a network of voluntary agencies called the Inter-Agency Group, said it was coordinating the state’s relief efforts with those of national and international agencies.

Assam’s Health Services Department has also been asked to address urgent medical issues arising from the floods.

Father Velickakam said the Church’s social service group, Caritas India, had begun planning through its diocesan units to ensure the immediate supply of drinkable water aside from other immediate and long-term assistance in the provision of food and life essentials.

“There is a dire need for temporary shelters with basic sanitation facilities for those on embankments and roadsides,” the priest said. “We are also planning to take concrete measures to protect vulnerable groups, particularly children and women, who are taking shelter in camps and other safe places.”

Allen Brooks, spokesman of the Assam Christian Forum, told ucanews.com that Catholic bishops in all 14 dioceses of Assam had instructed parishes to open their institutions such as schools and hostels to shelter and help the flood victims.

“Church groups are also offering voluntary work to district officials so that we can work in tandem with the state and help in all possible ways,” Brooks said.

Kaziranga National Park, which hosts two-thirds of the world’s great one-horned rhinoceroses, has been marooned and 17 animals have died, according to initial reports.

The Assam state government says 15 National Disaster Response Force teams comprising 380 personnel have been deployed to rescue people from flood-affected areas.

Floods have become an annual feature in Assam, the largest of India’s northeastern states. Its topography and meteorological factors such as exposure to high rainfall make it prone to floods.

British charity Oxfam, in a detailed report on last year’s Assam floods, estimated that more than three million hectares of land in Assam was prone to floods, of which roughly one million hectares was directly affected every year.

The social, economic and ecological costs from successive floods are huge, says the report, added that Assam had already suffered irreversible land erosion.

“Since 1954, erosion of over 0.42 million hectares of land has happened, which is a whopping 7.1 percent of the state’s landmass,” the report said. “Southern Assam has borne the maximum brunt of erosion, which has swept away several villages and small towns.”","Wed, 17 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ucanews.com/uploads/2019/07/5d2e9cfd70e21_600.png,"['groups', 'land', 'join', 'flood', 'states', 'hectares', 'state', 'northeastern', 'assam', 'help', 'floods', 'million', 'national', 'report', 'church', 'rush', 'victims']", ,flood

Flood waters have also deluged parts of National Highway-37 in Kaziranga, Morigaon, Bokakhat, Dergaon and Jhakhalabandha areas of the state disrupting normal traffic movement and causing discomfort to commuters travelling between upper and lower Assam districts.

In such a scenario, railways have become a preferred mode of transportation for most people.

Keeping in mind the safety and urgency of movement for people in different parts of state, the Northeast Frontier (NF) Railway has decided to add additional coaches in as many as 10 popular trains connecting important stations of upper and lower Assam.

The railway authorities have ordered to add at least two extra coaches in each train keeping in mind the heavy rush.

Informing about the development, Union minister for railways Piyush Goyal took to his official Twitter handle on Tuesday.

As people are struggling to survive, a politician is doing his bit to provide some relief to at least some of the flood victims.

Mrinal Saikia/ Facebook

Mrinal Saikia, the BJP MLA from Khumtai constituency has been leading a one-of-a-kind mission for the past couple of weeks.

Saikia is hitting the road with his customized vehicle which can be used as a 'mobile kitchen'. Since July 13, Saikia has been travelling to flood-affected places, where he cook hot meals for the flood victims on his mobile kitchen and often use small boats to distribute among the needy.

Mrinal Saikia/ Facebook

According to Saikia, he has already fed more than 15,000 people and has no plans to slow down. Speaking about him distributing cooked food, Saikia said he decided to do so as most of the people still had no means to cook the rice and daal at home.

Saikia who had done a similar served last year too said that he had prepared for the floods this year well in advance and had collected the relief materials.

Mrinal Saikia/ Facebook

It is not just rice and daal that Saikia has on his customized vehicle, it also has emergency medicines which is high in demand in the flood-affected regions, but are in short supply.

Another initiative that Saikia has undertaken is to distribute paddy sapling among rice farmers who lost their crop in the recent floods.

Seeing his dedicated work, more people including volunteers are joining Saikia's mission to help the needy.

79,79,FL-2019-000084-IND,How climate change has increased flood events in India Rise in temperatures would increase flood events - Down To Earth Magazine,https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/how-climate-change-has-increased-flood-events-in-india-65649,"Rise in temperatures would increase flood events in frequency during end of century (2071-2100), says a climate report

Climate change has had extreme impacts in India. Rise in average global temperatures have led to a worrying trend of no rain for long periods and then a sudden bout of excessive rainfall, causing extreme weather events, particularly floods which took lives, destroyed homes and agricultural yields as well as resulted in huge revenue losses.

Rise in temperatures would increase flood events in frequency during end of century (2071-2100), according to Climate change and India: A 4 X4 assessment a sectoral and regional analysis for 2030s report.

Temperatures in the Himalayan region are projected to rise up to 2.6 degrees Celsius and also increase in intensity by 2-12 per cent by 2030s. This will result in increased flash floods events leading to large scale landslides and loss of agriculture area affecting food security, stated the report.

As a result of the changing climate, monsoon rainfall in 2018 was the sixth-lowest since 1901, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). It was also the sixth-warmest year since 1901, when recording started.

Further, monsoons in 2019 have also been recorded as the slowest progressing in at least 12 years, IMD data showed. Till July 7, 2019, IMD recorded a rainfall deficit of 21 per cent, while June recorded the second-lowest rainfall in the past seven years after the 42 per cent deficit in 2014.

Moreover, 20 states in the country witnessed deficient rainfall, while three were in ‘large deficient’ category from June 1 to July 7 this year.

Deficit rainfall and floods

Despite the scant rainfall, 1.4 million people have been affected by the floods due to heavy rainfall across the North East in the last week. Incessant rainfall in the past 72 hours has cut areas due to flooding.

According to IMD, there remains a rainfall deficit of 14 per cent. On July 6, when Baksa district in Assam was flooding, the deficit in North East was 38 per cent.

The flood situation, according to a release by IMD, may worsen. Heavy to very heavy showers have been predicted across Assam and Meghalaya in the next 48 hours. Another 2 million have been displaced in Bihar due to rising flood waters, media reported.

Other states experiencing floods include Mizoram, Meghalaya, Tripura. Parts of Maharashtra have been put on high alert, media reported.

Earlier in July, five days of torrential rains led to floods in Mumbai city. From June 20 to June 26, Mumbai had received only 8.4 mm rainfall, a deficit of 95 per cent. But, extreme rainfall in the last week of June caused floods in the city. Similarly in 2018, a deficit in rainfall for an extended period and then intense rainfall caused floods, landslides and flash floods.

Kerala, which experienced floods killing more than 500 people, last year also faced a dormant monsoon before the rains began, which did not stop for almost two weeks.

This has been the worrying trend for the past few years. In 2016, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan faced a drought-like situation when floods occurred in July-August, while Bihar and Assam — two states that are facing their worst floods in almost three decades, had deficit rainfall that monsoon.

Global rainfall data for over the last century also shows an alarming trend. The number of rainy days is decreasing while intense rainfall events of 10-15 centimetre per day are increasing. This means that more amount of water is pouring down in lesser time. For example, globally, 50 per cent of annual precipitation (rain, snow and ice) is received in just 11 days.

Widespread extreme rain events over Central India have increased three-fold in the 66-year period between 1950 and 2015, showed a study published in the journal Nature Communications.

A 10-30 per cent increase in rainfall events over the region where more than 150 mm of rain is registered in a day has been occurring despite a general weakening of monsoon circulation, it noted.

Another study conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar, had predicted an increase in extreme rainfall events in Southern and Central India and had linked it to global warming due to climate change.

Monsoon floods and landslides sweeping through large swathes of South Asia have killed dozens of people and left hundreds of thousands displaced, stranded, or in need of basic aid with more heavy rains expected in the coming days.

Aid organisations are warning of growing humanitarian needs in parts of the region. Tirtha Prasad Saikia, joint director for the North-East Affected Area Development Society, or NEADS, a local NGO in India’s northeastern state of Assam, said his organisation’s assessment teams are seeing widespread damage to shelters, crops, and livestock, along with an urgent need for basics like food, drinking water, and sanitation.

“People are facing a serious crisis,” he told The New Humanitarian. “Government infrastructure like hospitals and schools are under water. It will take many days or many months to get it back to normal.”

In Assam the rains caused the Brahmaputra River to burst its banks, flooding more than 3,000 villages as of Sunday. State authorities say the floods have killed at least four people, and affected a total of 2.6 million. Disaster management officials have set up dozens of relief camps and distribution centres.

Floodwaters are also seeping downstream into Bangladesh, which is an enormous delta for the Brahmaputra and Ganges rivers. The Bangladesh Red Crescent Society said there is “massive” flooding in northern and northeastern Bangladesh.

And hilly southern districts like Chattogram and Cox’s Bazar – together home to nearly one million Rohingya refugees – are threatened by flash floods and landslides. At least 270,000 people in Bangladesh are already impacted and many communities have been “marooned” by the rising waters, humanitarian groups say.

A Red Crescent report tracking the humanitarian response in Bangladesh stated: “The current flood situation is likely to worsen in the coming days, as all major rivers in the affected districts are flowing above the danger mark with a rising trend.”

In Nepal, at least 65 people are dead and dozens more are missing, officials reported. More than 10,000 households have been displaced as heavy rainfall drenched parts of the country beginning Friday.

Elsewhere in India, at least 15 people are dead in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states, according to the Euopean Union’s humanitarian arm, ECHO. Both states straddle Nepal’s southern border.

Cross-border impacts

Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and parts of China and northern India are linked in a massive interconnected river basin, which sees excess water in higher-altitude regions flow downstream through heavily populated low-lying areas.

assamfloods-3.jpeg NEADS People wade through floodwaters in Assam’s Jorhat District.

Intense rains are common during this part of South Asia’s monsoon season, which typically lasts from June through October. During the 2017 monsoon, weeks of flooding affected 40 million and killed 1,200 people in Nepal, India, and Bangladesh. Researchers say climate change made extreme rains in some parts of the region twice as likely in 2017.

This year’s floods haven’t reached 2017’s emergency levels. But there are pockets of concern in specific areas. In the Rohingya camps of southern Bangladesh, floods and landslides have displaced more than 5,000 people from their tent homes and affected roughly 5 percent of the settlements. UN agencies say it’s the most severe weather the camps have seen since more than 700,000 Rohingya were driven out of Myanmar beginning in August 2017.

“Many new villages that had not experienced floods for the last 30 years, they are now experiencing floods.”

In Assam, the intensity of this year’s floods is the worst in decades, said NEADS’ Saikia. Monsoon floods have become noticeably more damaging over the last five to eight years, he said – an outcome he blames on deforestation and mining in uphill areas, a failure to repair eroding riverbanks, and the changing climate.

“The character of floods is changing. The rivers are causing more damage to the people,” he said. “Many new villages that had not experienced floods for the last 30 years, they are now experiencing floods.”

The floods in Assam turned critical in the first week of July 2019. Incessant rains in the state led to overflow of major rivers and tributaries leading to inundation in the catchment areas of river Brahmaputra. The floods caused massive displacement of people and damaged the crops, livestock and properties. This also led to destruction of critical infrastructure and hampering essential services.

The current flood scenario has affected 4.3 million populations in 4157 villages under 113 Revenue Circles. Out of the total 33 districts in Assam 30 districts have been badly affected. The total death has risen to 71 in the current flood. The flood hit districts are Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Biswanath,

Sonitpur, Darrang, Udalguri, Baksa, Barpeta, Nalbari, Chirang, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, Dhubri, South Salmara, Goalpara, Kamrup Metro, Morigaon, Hojai, Nagaon, Golaghat, Majuli, Jorhat, Sivasagar,

Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Cachar, Karbi Anglong, Hailakandi and Karimganj.

As per the latest data, 183 relief camps are operational providing relief to the affected people. In these relief camps a total of 83,180 flood affected people are taking shelter. In addition, 311 relief distribution centres have been set up by the district administration. As per government data, Barpeta district has been the worst flood hit area affecting 996,190 people. There were also 937,268 people affected in Dhubri and 563,049 in Morigaon.

Capacity

Church's Auxiliary for Social Action (CASA) is the social action arm of the 24 Protestant and Orthodox churches in India. CASA is mandated to work for the poor and the marginalized, irrespective of any political, religion and caste consideration. CASA today is operational in 22 states, including five states in North-east India, in approximately 5,000 villages. In addition CASA supports and accompanies around 400 NGOs working on different issues throughout the country. CASA continues to respond to 60-70 small and medium disasters annually and also responds comprehensively to major emergencies with an enhanced perspective in its strategies of integrating a long-term understanding of the causes and consequences.

CASA’s strengths and added capacity emerge from its direct relationship with the vulnerable communities especially the dalits, tribals, women and others, the village/cluster level Disaster Mitigation Task forces built up over a period of time in vulnerable regions of the country and also with its accompaniment of a large number of NGOs and their forums and networks operational throughout the country. The Northeast India Programme of CASA has an Office in Guwahati and they will be implementing the programme. The coordination office for the NEI programme in Guwahati has 6 staff. Further the NEI programme also has local partners associated in their regular programme.","Wed, 31 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1338419-RRFs-India-Monsoon-Floods-RRF-10_2019.png?itok=lY7ka4_L,"['fund', 'flood', 'rapid', 'floods', 'india', 'total', 'relief', 'rrf', 'operational', 'emergency', 'affected', 'response', 'rrf102019', 'monsoon', 'districts', 'casa', 'assam', 'programme', 'country']", ,flood
86,86,FL-2019-000084-IND,Floods in the Time of NRC: A Toss up Between Life and Citizenship - The Wire,https://thewire.in/rights/assam-flood-nrc-life-citizenship,"Growing up in Kolkata, I used to wait for the northwesterly winds and cloudy skies in the evenings; for the sultry afternoon sun to recede behind clouds, covering the city in long shadows. Then the rains came, hard pellets hitting the streets, pounding windows, strong gusts of wind blowing through the city. Memories of rain spattered afternoons – when Calcuttans unfurled their Mohendra Dutt umbrellas, walked in the downpour, water lapping at their feet, wind blowing against their faces – used to be a joyous prospect.

Not anymore.

As the Earth heats up, rains grow harder, and floods become endemic, people watch the skies with anxiety, not longing. For tens of thousands, living along precarious coastlines and in low-lying areas, in houses of doubtful durability, the onset of the monsoon can be a harbinger of death and destruction.

In 2019, we find a new layer to this emerging narrative. This layer, inserted by politics, is currently playing out in the race to prove one’s citizenship in this country. At this moment, thousands of people in Assam, a majority of them poor, are living in houses where water levels have risen to alarming heights. But people in these submerged houses are unwilling to move to places of safety. They have the noose of a July 31 deadline tightening around their neck. The final National Register of Citizens (NRC) will be published at the end of this month, barely two weeks from now. Till then, flood-affected people – however vulnerable they are to rising, perilous waters – are resolved to guard their documents.

The situation is a toss-up between life and citizenship. You may survive the floods but still not be able to prove your bonafide claim to go on living in the country you have inhabited for decades. What would the survivor of a natural calamity do if she cannot escape the punitive fiat of a “strong” state? She may find herself transported to a detention camp, reduced to the status of a stateless refugee, having to move from place to place filled with anxiety and fear. Her destiny lies in the documents that may or may not prove her citizenship.

It’s heart-breaking when you think of the condition of these homes going under water. These are not glitzy advertorial apartments with swanky safes or lockers built in to ensure the safety of important belongings. Neither do many of those affected have bank accounts and secure vaults. A compassionate state (if that very invocation is itself not an anomaly) committed to protecting the poor and vulnerable would frame rules keeping the interests of such precarious populations in mind. But as history shows, it is the poor, who, without fail, who feel the brunt of ill-conceived policies.

An Indian Express report on Wednesday revealed the predicament of people trying to cope with the ravages of floods and the stringent citizenship test. Many of those stuck in flooded areas are simply refusing to leave their houses, said the report. Parvesh Kumar, a rescuer from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF,) was trying in vain, for two days, to persuade Rina Begum, a resident of Tulsibari village in Assam’s Morigaon district, to leave her half-submerged house. “Over the last 48 hours, as rescuers shuttle her neighbours from their marooned homes to dry land, Begum, a 50-year-old grandmother of four, watched but remained defiant. “How can we leave our home?” she says, standing in waist-deep water,” the report states.

The reporter goes on to say, even when many families agree to leave their homes, they insist on ensuring the safety of their documents. It quotes Parvesh Kumar saying: “So many times, we brought them to safety only to go back again because they realise they have forgotten their document.” Land and home are defining identity markers in minority-dominated areas of Assam. “This could be one of the reasons that they feel so scared to leave their homes,” a local official told the Indian Express.

Climate, culture and refugees

The convergence of floods and the last days and weeks leading up to the final NRC paint a picture of what the world is going to increasingly look like in the days, months and years ahead. Perpetuating cycles of migrants in search of safety and livelihood, refugees produced by climate change and state action will walk in lock-step. The crises of climate and culture will converge to create new refugees. Proving citizenship is going to become the next big battle ground, and the state will step up its demand to produce increasingly more documents to prove that one belongs to the land one considers home.

India knows the trauma of refugees, knows it intimately, and on many fronts. If the 1947 Partition, and the 1971 Bangladesh war of liberation produced one kind of refugees, the displacement of tribals by massive economic projects produced another mass of landless people. Stripped off their homes and lands, residents become migrants become refugees. Against this backdrop, the NRC has opened yet another flank, further muddying and complicating an already fractious political discourse.

This Tuesday, home minister Amit Shah once again indicated his government’s resolve to make the NRC a nationwide project. He was responding to a supplementary question raised by Samajwadi Party member Javed Ali Khan. “Currently, the NRC is a part of Assam Accord. The Centre – as per its election manifesto – is dedicated to weaning out illegal immigrants from every inch of this country. We will make sure that all such immigrants are deported as per international law,” said Shah.

The NRC’s implications are huge. It has set off new tensions in an already existing atmosphere of anxiety and fear. We are witnessing the trauma, bewilderment and helplessness of the people excluded from the register in Assam. It’s difficult to grapple with what the consequences of such a nationwide exercise and what they will look like.","Thu, 18 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/16121448/2019_7img15_Jul_2019_PTI7_15_2019_000212B-800x400.jpg,"['nrc', 'water', 'houses', 'state', 'floods', 'assam', 'citizenship', 'safety', 'homes', 'life', 'leave', 'refugees', 'prove', 'toss']", ,flood

He also informed him that he has asked the state ministers and all public representatives, including MLAs, to extend a helping hand to the victims of floods and personally involve themselves in the rescue operations.

To a query of the Prime Minister, Sonowal informed that flood control mechanisms, including 24X7 control rooms, have been pressed into service with state government officials put on duty, manning them round the clock, the release said.

The health department and the Public Health Engineering department have been directed to respond to medicare related issues and provide medicines and clean drinking water, Sonowal informed.

Veterinary and Animal Husbandry department has been asked to take care of the marooned animals and keep adequate fodder stock ready for the stray animals of Kaziranga National Park, other national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, he added.

He also told the Prime Minister about his direction to the authorities of national parks to supply fodder to the animals taking shelter on the high lands.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured all help, support and cooperation from the Centre to help Assam government bailout from the situation and asked the Chief Minister to undertake relief, rescue and rehabilitation measures on a war footing, the release said.

Earlier, on Saturday, the chief minister had briefed Union Home Minister Amit Shah about the flood situation in the state. Shah directed the National Disaster Response Force and other agencies to provide all necessary help to the flood-affected people.

The flood situation in Assam worsened on Sunday with the death toll rising to 11 and affecting nearly 26.5 lakh people.

Barpeta is the worst-hit district with 7.35 lakh people facing the flood fury, followed by Morigaon where 3.50 lakh people are hit. In Dhubri district, 3.38 lakh people are affected, the Assam State Disaster Management Authority said.

(PTI Photo)

Assam floods: Animals in the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary in Morigaon district of Assam under Guwahati Wildlife division have been bearing the brunt of heavy flooding in the larger parts of the sanctuary as incessant rains continue to lash the northeastern state. While many of them seek refuge in the remaining highlands in the park, hunger pangs have driven others out of the forest area. As per an estimate, around 85 per cent area of Pobitora is flooded with water.

A video posted by news agency ANI showed the plight of flood-hit animals. One-horned Indian rhinoceros, which is listed as ‘Vulnerable’ on the IUCN Red List, can be seen taking refuge in the isolated highlands in the otherwise flooded wildlife sanctuary. Its movement has largely got restricted owing to heavy flooding. The one-horned rhinoceros are running helter-skelter for safety, only to risk their lives from predators or from poachers and starvation too.

Many animals flocked together in groups to safeguard against nature’s agony. Haunted by scarcity of food, most of the wild animals have moved to the park’s numerous highlands. A number of other animals have moved to the Karbi hills, an area vulnerable for poaching.

Heavy rains and floods have damaged or submerged almost all the roads connecting to the forest camps in Pobitora. The forest personnel use country boats to take stock of the situation in the park. The floods have hit the anti-poaching operations in the park as many of the anti-poaching camps are submerged under water. The state government has deployed Special Rhino Protection Force personnel to protect fleeing rhinos from poaching.

The latest video from inside the park has come after the images of a fully grown Royal Bengal Tiger ‘relaxing’ on a bed inside a shop in the flooded Kaziranga National Park went viral on social media and thrown spotlight on the plight of animals as the state battles the deluge. Over 95% of the Park is submerged, rendering animals shelterless and forcing them to look for refuge in human habitations and highlands.

According to news agency PTI, the calamity has claimed the lives of 129 animals in the Kaziranga National Park, including 10 rhinos, 62 hog deer, eight sambhar deer and an equal number of wild boar, five swamp deer, two porcupines, an elephant and a wild buffalo till Saturday since July 13. Many animals were killed after being hit by vehicles while crossing the national highway 37 to reach the highlands in nearby Karbi Anglong district.","Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.financialexpress.com/2019/07/1-813.jpg,"['bear', 'wildlife', 'near', 'guwahati', 'brunt', 'rhinoceros', 'state', 'submerged', 'highlands', 'floods', 'assam', 'pobitora', 'animals', 'sanctuary', 'watch', 'wild', 'park']", ,flood

92,92,FL-2019-000084-IND,Flood management: Looking beyond defence strategies - Telegraph India,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/flood-management-looking-beyond-defence-strategies/cid/1701895,"Floods in the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Barak flood plains have become an annual phenomenon. The scale of the disaster is enormous, dwarfing the menace of floods in many other states. At its peak, the floods affected around 4,600 villages and 57.5 lakh people in Assam and 1,240 villages and 81.6 lakh people in North Bihar. The administration responded with rescue operations and set up relief camps and relief distribution centres. But these do not match the enormity of the disaster. A concerted effort towards flood governance through resilience building is the need of the hour.

There is a discernible pattern in the government’s response to floods: making long-term promises and implementing short-term disbursements. This year, with the floods at their peak, the Assam government reiterated its zeal to work towards a permanent solution to the flooding, including the proposal to form a Northeast water management body. This would be a welcome step, but only if the government takes bold steps to bring in a paradigm shift in flood governance.

The discourse of experts on flood management coalesces around flood defence strategies that aim to minimize the probability of flooding through structural interventions such as dams, embankments, bank strengthening works, rivets and spurs, and the dredging of rivers. The demand for dredging of the Brahmaputra to contain floods in Assam, or the proposal to construct a high dam in Nepal to prevent floods in Bihar, is a case in point. But such flood defence strategies have their own challenges.

Other options

Building dams on rivers, which carry huge quantities of silt, might actually be a fruitless exercise. With suboptimal reservoir management, the dams could enhance the vulnerability of the flood-prone populace through reservoir-induced flooding. Embankments suffer from the ‘build-neglect-rebuild’ syndrome. Unfortunately, they are better known for breaches than for protection. This year, around 24 of 33 districts in Assam have reported damages in embankments. In Bihar, the data on embankment are missing in the daily reports issued by the disaster management department. While the average weekly rainfall in 12 affected districts in Bihar between July 18 and 24 was mostly deficient, the number of villages and people adversely affected by floods continued to rise. One wonders if the embankments constricted the spread of floods or were aiding the process.

The discourse needs to move away from structural interventions towards the life and the livelihoods of communities residing in recurrent flood-prone areas. An entire gamut of flood risk management strategies needs to be simultaneously implemented through a combination of structural and other kinds of intervention. This implies investments in health, education and livelihoods as well as developing roads, culverts, sluice gates on embankments, and embankment rehabilitation. This would push the flood management paradigm beyond flood defence strategies to include flood risk preparation, mitigation, protection, and post-flood recovery strategies.

Such initiatives would require the participation of diverse stakeholders to be successful. If the frequency of high-intensity rainfall rises, embankments might still have an important protective role to play. But this will only be possible if the ‘build-neglect-rebuild’ syndrome gives way to participatory embankment management.

The simultaneous implementation of diversified strategies can lead to resilience building in recurrent flood-prone areas. Only then would populations succeed in resisting the adversities of flooding, absorb and recover from the devastation, and continue to adapt and transform their lives and livelihoods by maximizing the use of available resources.","Sun, 01 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://assets.telegraphindia.com/telegraph/ece2f5fd-0ecc-4a91-9041-676e22aea829.jpg,"['defence', 'management', 'structural', 'flood', 'embankments', 'strategies', 'floods', 'assam', 'villages', 'bihar', 'looking', 'flooding']", ,flood

GUWAHATI: When 409 inmates were shifted from the flooded Dhubri jail to a girls’ college nearby on Monday night, an undertrial accused of rape smelled an opportunity. In the wee hours of Wednesday, just a day after the shifting was complete, 28-year-old Hajifur Rahman broke open the grill of a window and swam to freedom. The Assam police DIG (Western Range) said investigation is on and a manhunt has been launched.

All the prisoners of the Dhubri district jail were shifted to the Dhubri Girls’ college building, which was notified as the temporary jail after floodwaters inundated the original jail campus, on Monday night. When the college’s ground floor got flooded too, the prisoners — including eight women — were kept in various classrooms-turnedprison cells on the first floor.

“Rahman managed to flee through a window of the college building. Though a security blanket was put in place after the prisoners were shifted, a college building can never be as secure as a prison. He managed to break a window grill and flee in the darkness,” said a police officer, adding that Rahman hails from Chagalchara Part II village in Dhubri district and was arrested on rape charges in 2018.

The police said the rising levels of the Brahmaputra, a stormy night and ‘zero’ electricity were some of the major difficulties faced by them at the designated jail campus. “Lack of electricity in the area has made it very difficult for personnel at night. We only had torches and other basic equipment. We had roped in an additional police company from Panbari to avoid a situation like this, but even that did not prove to be enough,” added the officer. Raunak Ali Hazarika, Assam police DIG (Western Range), said, “We have registered a sou motu case to find out the cause behind the prisoner’s escape and to fix responsibility. A manhunt is on to nab him.” He added that the flood situation was likely to improve and all the prisoners could soon be taken back to their original prison cells.

Assam heartthrob Riyan Parag is the latest to step forward and contribute Rs 1 lakh to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund (CMFR).

On Saturday, Assam CM Sarbananda Sonowal took to Twitter to express his gratitude towards the Assam cricketer. “Thank you @ParagRiyan for your contribution of Rs 1 lakh to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. It is heartening to see the young generation coming forward in large numbers to help those affected during #AssamFloods,” he tweeted.

Hailing from Assam, Parag was one of the most promising cricketers in this year’s Indian Premier League (IPL) and was a part of the India Under-19 side for the two youth Tests in England. He was India’s second highest run-getter behind Parthiv Shaw in the youth Tests and played a crucial role during India’s win in Chesterfield.

In October 2017, Parag was named in India’s squad for the 2017 ACC Under-19 Asia Cup. He made his first-class debut for Assam in the 2017-18 Ranji Trophy against Hyderabad and has one 50 to his credit.

98,98,FL-2019-000084-IND,WATCH: Assam MLA gets his hands dirty to drain out flood water - EastMojo,https://www.eastmojo.com/news/2019/07/25/watch-assam-mla-gets-his-hands-dirty-to-drain-out-flood-water/,"Guwahati: Notice this person closely — he is trying to drain out flood water from his house using a bucket. It is symbolic. Even he knows that a bucket is not going to help him clear the flooding and that he is not effectively getting rid of the water.

But the man is aware that a letter to the Indian Railways is what can possibly change the entire scenario with the onset of monsoon fury.

The man in the video that has now gone viral also happens to be Rabiram Narzary, the MLA from Kokrajhar West in Assam. Sadly, this is an annual feature in the Tengapara area of Kokrajhar, which houses Narzary’s residence-cum-office.

“For the effective solution of this annual flash floods in Kokrajhar, the Railways should come up with a new scheme. The small hume pipes which are being used by the railways for allowing water to flow under a railroad from one side to the other should be replaced by culverts. Only then the water will drain properly and we will be relieved,” Narzary said.

This is an annual feature in the Tengapara area of Kokrajhar, which houses MLA Rabiram Narzary’s residence-cum-office

Every year, it is the same story at several places of the Bodoland Territorial Council-administered Bodoland Territorial Area Districts (BTAD), including Kokrajhar. The entire district gets waterlogged with floodwaters entering private residences causing great distress to the locals.

Narzary’s house has been waterlogged for the past 48 hours. He said that this is the second time in a little over 10 days that his house has been partially submerged. “Only because the water doesn’t drain out properly of these hume pipes many villages and localities are submerged,” he added.

The MLA suggests that the railway authorities should do a re-survey on this issue and the entire thing has to be re-designed and re-constructed. Until that happens, the MLA has to wait for specialised equipment for the clean-up drive.
