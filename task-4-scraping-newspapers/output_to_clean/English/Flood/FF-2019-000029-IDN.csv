The Kompas newspaper in its March 8 edition reported that, according to the National Authority for Disaster Management (BNPB), there were 15 affected districts in East Java alone, with Madiun being the worst-hit.

BNPB spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho and National Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) head of meteorology Mulyono R. Prabowo explained that the high intensity of rainfall was due to the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO).

What, in fact, is the MJO, what distinguishes it from La-Niña and how can we get an early warning?

Indonesia lies within the intertropical convergence zone and borders on two vast oceans on its western and eastern sides, the Indian and the Pacific Ocean. This position results in a typical maritime climate. Surplus short-wave solar radiation in the equatorial ocean region may result in strong evaporation throughout the year. Humidity as a result of water vapor condensation is also higher, which is why the region tends to be cloudy at most times, leading to high rainfall variability. On the other hand, convective clouds driven by different diurnal heating over land and over sea may produce severe thunderstorms and even the formation of squall lines in many areas of Indonesia.

Meanwhile, as a result of the changing climate, the sea surface temperature is rising. Warmer sea temperature in the equatorial ocean region may intensify bands of convective clouds, which then create heavy rainfall, hail and surface wind gusts as well as twisters in the Indonesian region. Besides, the increase of sea surface temperature strongly influences climate variability in the region, i.e. the occurrence of El-Niño or La- Niña in the Pacific as well as Dipole Mode in the Indian Ocean, where such anomalies are projected to become more frequent in the future. Those climate phenomenons can be recognized by distinctive clouds pattern.

El-Niño and La-Niña are associated with the cooling and warming of sea surface temperature. Both are monitored based on sea surface temperature changes in the Pacific.

As the temperature drops, the rate of evaporation falls too, causing humidity to decrease. Consequently, convective clouds diminish, the sky is blue, the rain is gone and a longer dry season follows as a result of the delay of the onset. This results in what we know as El-Niño.

On the contrary, with La-Niña, strong condensation occurs as sea surface temperature increases. Following the abundance of humidity, large amounts of latent heat released contribute to the development of strong convective clouds. Torrential rain then falls in most parts of Indonesia, floods and landslide ensue.

In the meantime, a sister climate anomaly of El-Niño and La-Niña emerges in the Indian Ocean, namely Dipole Mode. If sea surface temperature anomalies in the western tropical Indian Ocean are higher, a so-called positive Dipole Mode, it will cause rainfall to decrease to below the normal level in Indonesia, leading to severe drought. In contrast, a negative Dipole Mode will see Indonesia suffer from intense rainfall above normal. El-Niño and La-Niña as well as Dipole Mode are categorized as nonseasonal climate factors. They have a return period of two to five years. Yet, such interannual events, particularly El-Niño and La-Niña, are well-known factors in the rainfall variability in Indonesia. For instance, El-Niño in 1997-1998 and 2015 and La-Niña in 2007 and 2016 were responsible for drought and floods in Indonesia.

Another factor that involves variations of climate over tropical regions is the Madden-Julian oscillation. It is considered as west-east circulation, originating from the Indian Ocean and vanishing in the western Pacific. The MJO is a convergent system that has an oscillation period of 30-60 days. It is identified as massive cumulonimbus clouds that occur during the transition period from March to May. Strong solar radiation quickly heats up the ocean, causing higher temperature at the surface. As stated above, this fuels on the growth of deep convective clouds, and pressure gradient causes the towering clouds accompanied by intense rainfall to move eastward across Indonesia. Above normal rainfall is recorded as it the resulting weather passes. If the environmental conditions are bad, it subsequently causes floods. The situation becomes worse when the MJO and La-Niña signals appear simultaneously.

The MJO is monitored with the MJO index, which is accessible online through the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. In March 2019, an MJO signal was detected to propagate above Indonesia and its surrounding area. High strength is indicated when the signal is outside of the centered circle. A strong signal has been observed to appear as intense rainfall occurs over Java. The whole Indonesian region is prone to the MJO, but due to southern cyclonic rotation, humid air is particularly attracted to the region of Java.

Rather than La Niña, the MJO may turn into a major climate threat, since it occurs intraseasonally. The MJO could occur more frequently amid climate change. As weather is a natural phenomenon, impact-based warning could be based on predicted monitoring. It could be both climate and floods forecasting.

The simplest way to do that is by measuring the rainfall accumulation. Floods are detected as rainfall exceeds its average climatological condition (at least 30 years of observation). The BMKG classifies climate conditions by degree, such as below normal, normal and above normal. A climate condition is considered normal if it ranges between 85 percent and 115 percent of the average. It is considered below and above normal if it is lower or higher than 85 percent or 115 percent of the average, respectively.

With the support of the data, we can easily perform a simple calculation to predict the climate outlook in the future. In addition, many free-to-access extreme climate indices have been developed by the World Meteorological Organization. These could be tools to assess flood risks.

Weather modification through cloud seeding definitely requires large expenses, while the probability of success is small. Building public awareness of environmental care is essential. The protection of watershed areas, the preservation of forest and catchment areas, a green policy, the management of drainage system as well as the reduction of polymer waste are necessary.

In addition, disasters in Indonesia can become worse as a result of mismanagement; a classic problem in the country.

Above all, tropical regions, including Indonesia, without doubt can be regarded as giant weather engines. Not only do they produce rainfall clouds that brings life and hope to the region, they also control the Earth's climate system, bringing life to the globe. We can be grateful for this. (wng)

Flash floods have killed at least 58, injured dozens and displaced more than 4,000 people in the Indonesian province of Papua, according to disaster officials.

Following heavy rains on Saturday, flash floods hit the town of Sentani, killing 51 and injuring 74, according to Reuters. Nearby, in the provincial capital of Jayapura, seven more were killed when landslides caused by the same rains slammed into homes and swept away residents.

In a message to reporters, Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said, ""The number of casualties and impact of the disaster will likely increase as search and rescue teams are still trying to reach other affected areas.""

Nine houses were washed away in Sentani, Nugroho said.

As the water begins to recede, officials are still trying to evacuate people. ""The joint search and rescue teams are still doing evacuations, and not all affected areas have been reached, because of fallen trees, rocks, mud and other material,"" Nugroho said, according to Agence France-Presse.

Nugroho posted videos online that showed waters rushing through streets and town centers. After daybreak, online videos showed rescuers and residents clambering through debris. In one video, an airplane with a damaged nose and propellers lay in the mud.

""Our house was flooded with thick mud. ... We immediately grabbed our valuables and ran to a neighbor's house to seek refuge. ... It's hard to get out of the area because many roads are blocked. ... I'm worried, sad and scared all at one time,"" Lilis Puji Hastuti, a 29-year-old mother of two young children in Sentani, told Agence France-Presse.

Suryadi Diaz, a Papua police spokesman, told The New York Times that the flooding was exacerbated by the cutting of trees in the hills above Sentani — part of an effort to convert the land for farming. Diaz said the lack of vegetation meant there was little in the mountainous region to slow the flash floods or landslides.

Flooding in Indonesia is common during the rainy season, which lasts from October through April. Earth magazine reports:

""Few people outside the region understand just how regularly natural disasters occur throughout Indonesia's 5,000-kilometer-wide archipelago. More than 2,000 serious disasters are reported each year, 90 percent of which are weather-related — mostly the result of flooding rains, tornadoes, fires and mudslides. In 2017, Indonesians reported 787 floods, 716 tornadoes, 614 landslides, and 96 forest and ground fires (burning peat lands and rainforests to make room for large palm oil plantations and smaller farms is a popular practice, especially in Sumatra).""

Papua, Indonesia's easternmost province, occupies the western half of the island of New Guinea. The region is rich in natural resources, but the poverty rates there are some of the highest in the country. As Time reported, despite its reputation as Indonesia's ""land of gold,"" Papua is the country's ""poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.""","Sun, 17 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/03/17/ap_19076244097411_wide-389e34721412b202366bfb74df9fd671a2fdbe79.jpg?s=1400,"['floods', 'dead', 'indonesia', 'dozens', 'landslides', 'reported', 'sentani', 'leave', 'search', 'indonesias', 'province', 'rescue', 'region', 'rains', 'papua', 'flash']",

The death toll from flash floods and landslides that tore through Indonesia’s Papua region has topped 100 with dozens more still missing, the disaster agency said on Wednesday.

Nearly 10,000 people have moved to shelters while at least 104 victims are confirmed to have died and 79 are unaccounted for in the aftermath of the disaster, which was triggered by heavy rain on Saturday.

Scores have suffered injuries, including cuts and broken bones, while some 40 unidentified bodies would be buried in a mass grave on Thursday, officials said.

Many survivors fear more floods will rip through hard-hit Papua, which shares a border with Papua New Guinea.

Hundreds of homes, bridges, schools and other public facilities have been destroyed [Reuters]

“The increasing number of evacuees has made the shelters very crowded and uncomfortable,” said national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.

As teams loaded mud-caked corpses into body bags, the search for survivors was hampered by mountains of debris including rocks and fallen trees.

Hundreds of homes, bridges, schools and other public facilities were destroyed.

More than 2,300 personnel have been deployed to search for the missing victims and to clean up debris.

Flooding is common in Indonesia, especially during the rainy season which runs from October to April.

In January, floods and landslides killed at least 70 people on Sulawesi island, while earlier this month hundreds in West Java province were forced to evacuate when torrential rains triggered severe flooding.

Meanwhile, three people were killed – including two Malaysian tourists – and some 182 were injured after an earthquake on Sunday triggered a landslide on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, next to Bali.

Lombok was rocked by several earthquakes last summer, killing more than 500 people and leaving over 150,000 homeless.

And in September last year, the country was hit by an earthquake and tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi island which killed around 2,200 people.

JAYAPURA, Indonesia – The death toll from flash floods and mudslides triggered by torrential downpours in Indonesia’s easternmost province has risen to 89, with dozens of others missing, officials said Tuesday.

Floodwaters and landslides destroyed roads and bridges in several areas of Papua province’s Jayapura district early Sunday, hampering rescue efforts.

National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said the worst-hit area from the flooding was Sentani subdistrict, where tons of mud, rocks and trees from a landslide on a mountain rolled down to a river that burst its banks, sweeping away residents.

He said 89 bodies had been pulled from the mud and wreckage of crumpled homes by Tuesday. Another 159 people were injured, including 84 who were hospitalized, many with broken bones and head wounds.

The number of dead is expected to rise as rescue workers comb through affected areas.

More than 1,600 rescuers, including soldiers and police, faced difficulties on Tuesday in clearing huge piles of debris due to shortages of heavy equipment, said Papua military spokesman Col. Muhammad Aidi.

“We face difficulties removing debris and the bodies under rubble as we don’t have enough excavators,” Aidi said, adding that rescuers were searching for 74 people reportedly missing and feared dead.

Nugroho said about 7,000 residents were displaced from their homes, with more than 400 houses and other buildings damaged and thousands of others submerged.

National Disaster Management Agency (BNPN) spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said the rain had been extremely heavy, reaching 235.1 mm per hour. ""Deforestation of the mountain was getting worse because people cut down trees for firewood and to open illegal plantations,"" he said.

Indonesian Forum for Environment (WALHI) in Papua province also indicated that the flash flood was caused by deforestation. The organization's head, Aiesh Rumbekwan, explained: ""We can see from the logs carried away by the current that the trees were not carried by the slides. They were cut down. This is very clear. So we assume that there was logging above.""

Palm plantations destroying natural balance

According to environment watchdog Greenpeace, opening up lands for big plantations for growing oil-producing palms, has been the main cause of deforestation in Indonesia. Last year, the group published the results of an investigation, which revealed that 25 palm oil-producing companies were responsible for denuding 1300 square kilometers of forest cover in Indonesia since 2015.

Greenpeace also highlighted several negative impacts of palm-oil plantations on the environment, humans and the climate. Among others, half of the orangutan population in Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo, was destroyed in 16 years. Moreover, deforestation and destruction of peatlands were the main cause of greenhouse gas emissions, which contributed to climate change.

Furthermore, many products people could buy in the supermarkets contained palm oil produced by the agribusiness giant Wilmar, Greepeace said. Popular products included Kitkat, Colgate toothpaste, Dove soap and Head & Shoulders shampoo. Consequently, the organization has been asking people to sign petitions to prevent companies from buying palm oil from Wilmar. It has also criticized and demanded stricter measures from Indonesian government and sanctions for companies who break the rules.

Other causes of deforestation

A recent study published by Environmental Research Letters, titled What causes deforestation in Indonesia, which was based on data gathered between 2001 and 2016, pointed out that large-scale oil palm and timber plantations were the biggest cause of deforestation in Indonesia. However, in recent years their impact on climate had reduced.

According to the research, conversion of forest cover into grassland rose sharply when El Nino caused severe drought fire activity on some parts of Indonesia, particularly in 2016. The study also revealed that road construction and mining activities were important drivers of deforestation in some areas.

The research, which was led by Kemen G. Austin, also revealed that small-scale agriculture and small-scale plantations contributed to one-fifth of the loss in forest cover, not only in the big islands of Sumatra, java, Borneo and Sulawesi, but also smaller islands like Papua.

Warning is not enough

According to the Indonesian Forum for Environment (WALHI), the government has been neglecting the problem of deforestation and controls at the ground level are not working. WALHI activists said that following the warning, officials in Jayapura, the capital of Papua province, should have ensured that locals were following instructions. Other organizations like Greenpeace have also raised this issue.

WALHI Papua's Kemen G Austin and his colleagues, who have been researching forest cover loss in Indonesia for the last 15 years, pointed out that the causes were much more varied than previously thought. They also changed from place to place and over time. The researchers therefore suggested ""the need for forest conservation policy responses tailored at the subnational level and new methods for monitoring the causes of deforestation over time.”","Wed, 27 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/47951386_6.jpg,"['indonesia', 'forest', 'deforestation', 'triggering', 'cover', 'causes', 'palm', 'calamities', 'environment', 'natural', 'revealed', 'plantations', 'walhi']",

Deadly flash floods

Flash floods and mudslides in the country's easternmost Papua province meanwhile killed at least 77 people and injured more than 70 others, local officials said on Monday, raising the death toll. Thousands of people have been left homeless.

The flooding was due to torrential rain, which hit the provincial capital of Jayapura beginning Saturday.

""Most of the bodies were found under damaged houses and buried under materials brought down from the mountain area by the flash floods,"" said a spokesman for Papua police, Muhammad Aidi.

Nine villages flooded

The water has submerged more than 150 houses in the badly hit Sentani area near Jayapura, said Sutopo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.

He added that nine villages in Jayapura had been flooded and three bridges damaged.

""Waters have now receded, leaving mud, logs and other materials carried by the flash floods,"" Nugroho said in a statement, adding that the death toll ""will probably increase because the evacuation process is still taking place and not all affected areas have been reached.""

The rains triggered mudslides that buried dozens of homes in Sentani

More than 4,000 people were staying in temporary shelters, with authorities, the Red Cross and volunteers helping the displaced.

The province's administration has declared a two-week emergency in order to get assistance from the central government.

Papua is Indonesia's easternmost province. It shares an island with the nation of Papua New Guinea.

Flooding is fairly common during Indonesia's rainy season, which runs from October to April. In January, floods and landslides killed at least 70 people on Sulawesi Island. Severe inundation triggered by downpours in West Java province earlier this month also prompted hundreds of people to flee their homes.

Just wild weather or climate disruption? 'Rossby waves' unlock weather puzzle? ""Breakthrough"" insights into atmospheric dynamics are emerging from ""high-maths"" —scrutiny of satellite data, say scientists. Their Nature magazine article identifies ""significant connections"" between extreme rain events, often far apart. Their premise: global rainfall distribution stems ""probably"" from planetary waves named after the late Swedish-born American meteorologist Carl-Gustaf Rossby.

Yogyakarta / Mon, March 18, 2019 / 04:49 pm

Torrential rains that have hit Yogyakarta over the past few days have resulted in flooding and landslides in several locations, taking the lives of at least five individuals with one person still missing.

The local Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD) revealed that Imogiri district in Bantul regency was the worst affected area.

At least two houses on a hillside in Kedung Buweng village in Imogiri were destroyed by landslides, killing three inhabitants, namely Trisno Atmojo, 89, Eko Supadmi, 50, and Rufi Kusuma Putri, 9.

“We have found the body of Trisno. We are now escalating our efforts to find the other two victims,” BPDD Bantul head Dwi Daryanto said at the site Monday.

A Kedung Buweng resident, Widodo, said the landslides occurred on Sunday night at around 9 p.m. during a heavy downpour.

The BPBD Yogyakarta noted that another Imogiri resident named Sudiatmoko, 80, and an unidentified resident of Bantul regency had also died in a landslide.

Painem, 70, who lived in Karang Tengah village of Imogiri reportedly died after her body temperature dropped drastically when she became trapped in a house.

The recent torrential rains in Yogyakarta were caused by Tropical Cyclone Savannah in the Indian Ocean, said the BPBD Yogyakarta. The rain caused flooding in four districts in Kulon Progo regency, nine districts in Gunung Kidul regency and 14 districts in Bantul regency.

Bantul Regent Suharsono said he had distributed aid to the affected areas and would declare an emergency response period for the next seven days.

The worst ever recorded El Niño of 2015 caused the world’s weather to change. Presently El Niño is predicted to be more frequent, turning into a major climate anomaly threat. Given its normal 5-year return period, its early appearance this year has raised alarm bells. It is feared that El Niño-affected regions in Indonesia will severely suffer from sufficient water resources that might alter the planting season, reducing agricultural productivity and threatening national food security.

Many studies have revealed a strong correlation between El Niño and rainfall variability which further leads to retreat of the rainfall onset in Indonesia. A significant shift of the rainy season is found as El Niño signs strengthen, causing a prolonged dry season. Based on monthly average rainfall characteristics in 30 years, Indonesia is identified to have three main types of climatic zones, i.e., monsoonal, equatorial, and local type climates. The peak of the rainy season of the monsoonal type climate occurs in January-February. Meanwhile for the equatorial type climate (e.g., Aceh, North and West Sumatera, Riau and Kalimantan), two peaks of rainfall are found in March and October.

In the local type climatic zone (e.g., Maluku islands), the peak of the rainfall occurs in July/August. Monsoonal type-climatic zone is further divided into two types. The first are in regions with drier and longer dry season (e.g., Lombok, Nusa Tenggara) compared to that such as in Java, Bali, South Sumatra, South Sulawesi. Both types have significantly less rainfall during the dry season from June to August.

Since the center of Indonesia’s rice barns are mostly located in monsoonal type-climatic zones which are strongly affected by El Niño, it contributes greatly to drought over the region. In enhancing water resources management, the prediction of El Niño occurrence is then urgently required.

According to the latest report released in February from the United States’ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, El Niño signs with weak intensity is likely this year. In addition, Indonesia’s Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) also confirms weak El Niño until July in Indonesia. Though we might not have a severe drought approriate mitigation is still necessary. President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has appealed for efforts to overcome this issue so that farmers can harvest twice a year. As many as 65 dams are planned as well as improvement of irrigation systems to ensure water resources, the key to food security. Thus such climate anomaly should no longer become an obstacle to maintain or even increase agricultural productivity. Therefore the harvesting

season can be well-managed.

Climate-risk management with effective use of climate information would further help to manage water resources, particularly in scheduling rain harvesting and water storage. Professionals could then set up early strategies to optimize productivity during this year’s dry and rainy season which coincides with El Niño.

Reducing disaster risks by minimizing the climate risk through proper adaptation and mitigation is urgent. Excessive use of fossil fuel, forest exploitation, land conversion and forest fires have damaged the environment. The release of greenhouse gas emissions has been uncontrollable.

Monitoring of weather and climate conditions, transfer of climate knowledge and research results in the communities, building public awareness associated with extreme weather and its climate change impact such as in health, agriculture, tourism, fisheries etc are among necessary adaptation actions. Such awareness, along with environmental conservation, development of green energy, are among mitigation measures to help us cope with the inconvenient truth of global warming.

Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and between two continental plates so we can only accept our fate and be prepared for the worst: earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. We are destined to live with disasters.

Data show that from 2014 to 2018, thousands of natural disasters occurred in the country every year. Floods, landslides, tropical cyclones, droughts andangin puting beliung (small tornadoes) have happened one after another across the archipelago, claiming lives and causing material losses.

How many of us would blame ourselves for the disasters? The fact is that many of the calamities were man-made. They struck as a result of environmental degradation that humans have caused. When desire for fast profit and growth beats the vision of sustainability, nature will retaliate in the form of disaster.

Over the weekend, floods and landslides hit Papua, Yogyakarta and Central Java, killing nearly 90 people with 74 still missing and displacing more than 4,000 others.

A resident of Jayapura, Papua, said he heard a rumbling sound of large rocks tumbling down the Cyclops Mountains when a flash flood came. National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho and Indonesian Environmental Forum (Walhi) Papua head Aiesh Rumbekwan agreed that environmental damage in Cyclops Nature Reserve was the cause of the disasters.

Earlier in January, a bigger flood struck South Sulawesi, affecting thousands in 13 regencies and municipalities. The BNPB said the death toll from the disaster was 79.

South Sulawesi Governor Nurdin Abdullah said the flood stemmed from deforestation in the mountains and watershed area degradation along some rivers flowing from the mountains. Walhi in South Sulawesi said that even though the intense rainfall was also to blame, environmental degradation just exacerbated it. Later, Vice President Jusuf Kalla ordered the provincial government to restore the environment, especially on Bawakaraeng Mountain.

Before the recent floods in Papua and Yogyakarta, the BNPB reported that up until Feb. 7, 101 people had died this year as a result of hydrometeorological disasters. In late 2018, the agency had warned of another year of living dangerously as such disasters would remain predominant throughout 2019. The agency underlined that environmental damage would trigger the disasters, citing the 14 million hectares of “critical land” that dot the country.

The number of disasters is indeed increasing and surely worrying.

Consistently, hydrometeorological disasters have been the predominant type of calamity, with floods and landslides accounting for almost half of them. The combination of small tornadoes, forest fires and droughts — also classified as hydrometeorological—accounted for the other half of the disasters.

We have played a part in the disasters by supporting unsustainable development, evident in the rampant deforestation, which only takes quick dollars into consideration. Unless we change now, more floods and landslides will threaten our children tomorrow.","Wed, 20 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2018/12/23/2018_12_23_61444_1545527796._large.jpg,"['floods', 'flood', 'landslides', 'mountains', 'degradation', 'environmental', 'sulawesi', 'bnpb', 'disasters', 'papua', 'avoidable']",

The death toll in flash floods and landslides in Papua province of eastern Indonesia crossed 107 on Wednesday, while the search for 93 missing persons shifted to residential areas buried under mud, rubble and wooden logs, officials and rescuers said.

The natural disaster, which hit Jayapura district on the weekend, also left 84 people seriously injured and 75 others with minor injuries, spokesman of the joint command post for emergency relief efforts in the province Dodi Sambodo said, reported Xinhua news agency.

The disaster also forced 9,691 people to leave their homes and take shelter at 20 evacuation centres, most of which were government office buildings, the spokesman said.

""Rain keeps pouring down. Having shelters in buildings is favourable in this situation rather than tents. We plan to trim the number of the centres to six in order to pave (the way for) distribution of aid.""

Meanwhile, rescuers are searching for victims in residential areas where many houses were buried under mud, wooden logs and rubble, said Yudi Yanto, spokesman of the search and rescue office.

Advertisement The search operation will also be carried out at the entrance of a river to the Sentani Lake, as many victims were swept away by the strong currents of the river, he added.

The disaster also destroyed 357 houses, over 100 buildings, four bridges, eight school buildings and other infrastructure, according to the national disaster management agency.

Flash floods have been frequent in the remote Papua province, but the one on Saturday evening was among the worst.

Deforestation in the upstream area of a river was blamed as one of the triggers for the catastrophe, according to the agency.

Indonesia flood toll tops 100, dozens still missing

The death toll from flash floods and landslides that tore through Indonesia’s Papua region has topped 100 with dozens more still missing, the disaster agency said on Wednesday.

Nearly 10,000 people have moved to shelters while at least 104 victims are confirmed to have died and 79 are unaccounted for in the aftermath of the disaster, triggered by heavy rain on Saturday.

Scores have suffered injuries, including cuts and broken bones, while some 40 unidentified bodies would be buried in a mass grave on Thursday, officials said.

Many survivors fear more floods will rip through hard-hit Papua, which shares a border with independent Papua New Guinea on an island just north of Australia.

“The increasing number of evacuees has made the shelters very crowded and uncomfortable,” said national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.

As teams loaded mud-caked corpses into body bags, the search for survivors was hampered by mountains of debris including rocks and fallen trees.

Hundreds of homes, bridges, schools and other public facilities were destroyed.

More than 2,300 personnel have been deployed to search for the missing victims and to clean up debris.

Flooding is common in Indonesia, especially during the rainy season which runs from October to April.

In January, floods and landslides killed at least 70 people on Sulawesi island, while earlier this month hundreds in West Java province were forced to evacuate when torrential rains triggered severe flooding.

Meanwhile, three people were killed – including two Malaysian tourists – and some 182 were injured after an earthquake on Sunday triggered a landslide on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, next to Bali.

Lombok was rocked by several earthquakes last summer, killing more than 500 people and leaving over 150,000 homeless.","Thu, 21 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.phnompenhpost.com/sites/default/files/field/image/indonesia_flood_toll_tops_100_dozens_still_missing.jpg,"['floods', 'flood', 'indonesia', 'dozens', 'landslides', 'disaster', 'toll', 'island', 'victims', 'triggered', 'missing', '100', 'tops', 'shelters', 'papua', 'including']",

Tourism Minister Arief Yahya has said that Indonesia is currently developing disaster mitigation technology that will be placed in tourist destinations.

“The support of technology for disaster mitigation will improve the tourist experience,” Arief said in a press statement on Thursday, adding that the the country was taking steps toward meeting the standards introduced by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO).

The technology would also improve the competitiveness of the Indonesian tourist industry in the global market, he said.

The Tourism Ministry is attempting to help the country to reach 30th position in the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) of the World Economic Forum (WEF). Currently, Indonesia sits 42nd.

Meanwhile, Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) head Hammam Riza said the agency encouraged the use of early warning systems at tourist destinations that were frequently affected by disasters – both geological and the hydrometeorological.

“The BPPT has developed technology for an early warning system and early prevention for hydrometeorological disasters like flooding and landslides as well as geological disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis,” Hammam said.

He said three types of technology had been developed, namely the flood early warning system (FEWS), landslide early warning system (LEWS) and Red White Buoy system for tsunamis.

“The integrated detection and early warning technology using buoys, cables and radar are integrated into the existing early warning system, which is supported by the fourth generation of the communications system [...],” he added.

Residents fled their homes as heavy rain and flooding continued on Tuesday in Jayapura, Papua, inundating more villages across the regency.

At least 89 people are reported to have died with 84 suffering serious injuries on the third day of the torrential rain that has hit the country’s easternmost province.

More than 6,800 people are taking refuge at 15 shelters in Jayapura and they urgently need basic provisions such as food, bedding, clean water, clean clothes and electricity.

“The flash flooding has affected over 11,000 people,” said Jayapura Deputy Regent Giri Wijiyantoro, adding that survivors were taking shelter in schools, churches and facilities belonging to the Indonesian Military (TNI).

The torrential rain has discouraged people from returning to their homes.

In Gunung Merah, Sentani district, where the regency administration’s emergency post is located, the evacuees are being accommodated in the regent’s office. Most of them being mothers and children. The scene is being repeated in other shelters.

Although aid has continued to arrive from private sources and the government, evacuees are still in urgent need of food, drink and clothing.

“We also need milk for children under five years of age at the shelters,” volunteer Gustaf Griapon of the Gunung Merah shelter said, adding that other shelters were in similar need.

Some children lost their parents in the flash floods. They needed special services such as counseling and help in searching for relatives and family members, Gustaf said.

Some mothers expressed concern about the condition of their children as they began to fall ill.

“My child has had a fever since Sunday morning but I cannot yet take him to the health post or hospital because the road is damaged,” said Ance Wanimbo who was sheltering in Imanuel Church in Kampung Toladan.

Debris blocked the road connecting the church and the main post in the downtown area. In this church women and children took shelter inside the church while men stayed in makeshift tents erected outside the church.

The provincial branch of the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI Papua) is still collecting data on the need for clean water and other emergency aid such as clothes, diapers, sanitary napkins, baby milk, blankets and mattresses at the main post and hospitals.

“We have distributed some. We are expecting people to help us to report on other evacuation centers we have not yet recorded,” PMI Papua head Derek Windesi said.

The provincial emergency post has also recorded at least 351 severely damaged houses, mostly on hillsides or river banks, and 211 inundated houses around Sentani city and Doyo Baru.

Marcel Kia, a resident of the BTN Gajah Mada housing complex in Doyo Baru, said that floods had hit his area several times in the last five years but no action had been taken.

The number of evacuees and damaged or inundated houses could still rise. On Monday Lake Sentani overflowed inundating houses from Jayapura regency to Jayapura city. Some houses in Ayapo village in the middle of the lake were inundated to their rooftops.

“Residents here fled their homes yesterday using speedboats,” said Leo Ohee of Yoka village, Jayapura city, who lives by the side of the lake.

“The number of victims keeps increasing because the affected area is very large,” said National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a statement.

Sutopo said a joint team from 23 institutions comprising 1,613 personnel had been deployed to Sentani to provide emergency help for the victims of the flash flooding.","Tue, 19 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2019/03/17/2019_03_17_67854_1552819510._large.jpg,"['houses', 'sentani', 'ill', 'children', 'rain', 'fall', 'need', 'continues', 'post', 'emergency', 'shelter', 'jayapura', 'church', 'shelters']", 
18,18,FF-2019-000029-IDN,The Carbon Brief Profile: Indonesia carbonbrief.org - Carbon Brief,https://www.carbonbrief.org/the-carbon-brief-profile-indonesia,"In the sixth article of a series on how key emitters are responding to climate change, Carbon Brief looks at Indonesia’s efforts to curb deforestation and tame polluting peatland fires.

Indonesia was the world’s fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases in 2015. It is the 16th biggest economy and the largest in southeast Asia. Its emissions stem from deforestation and peatland megafires and, to a lesser extent, the burning of fossil fuels for energy.

The country recently overtook Australia again to become the world’s largest exporter of thermal coal. It plans to substantially increase its domestic coal-powered generation – partially in a bid to help close the “electricity gap” between its wealthy and less-connected islands.

The current government has pledged to cut emissions by 29-41% by 2030, compared to a “business as usual” scenario.

The country is holding a general election this April and polls suggest a win for current president Joko Widodo.

(Update 23/04/2019: Joko Widodo has declared victory in the presidential election after unofficial results from private pollsters suggested he had won around 55% of the popular vote. The official results will not be announced until 22 May.)

Politics

Indonesia is the world’s third largest democracy and almost 260 million people live across its chain of islands, of which there are an estimated 17,508. It also has the world’s largest Muslim population and is highly ethnically diverse, supporting more than 300 local languages.

The country has held general elections since 1955, but only began holding presidential elections in 2004. Its current leader, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, was elected in 2014 and will face another election this April. Widodo is a member of the “left-of-centre” Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) and leads a majority coalition government with the support of nine political parties.

Widodo is the first president in Indonesia to not come from an elite military or political background and remains untainted by the corruption allegations that dog other government officials. A year before he was elected, the Economist described him as “an honest man”. However, he faces criticism for doing little to advance human rights during his presidency.

His campaign for reelection is centred around promises to boost economic growth, largely through more infrastructure development, and to increase measures to tackle terrorism and corruption – with any mention of climate change so far “tragically absent”, according to the Jakarta Post, an English-language Indonesian newspaper.

Last year, Widodo boosted subsidies for diesel “amid worries that higher fuel costs [could] threaten his bid for re-election”, according to the Nikkei Asian Review, an Asia-focused financial publication. (He had previously overseen a “big-bang” removal of subsidies in 2015, according to the IEA, in a bid to reform Indonesia’s “decades-old” fuel support system.)

A poll in January by Charta Politika, an Indonesian political consultancy firm, found Widodo had an approval rating of 53.2%. His biggest rival, Prabowo Subianto – a former army general who lost to Widodo in 2014 – had an approval rating of 34.1%.

Research released in February by Jatam, an Indonesian NGO that monitors the mining industry, found that 86% of the $4m in donations reported by the Widodo campaign is linked to big mining and fossil-fuel companies. It also found that 70% of the $3.4m declared by the Prabowo campaign is linked to mining and fossil-fuel firms.

On 17 February 2019, both candidates took part in a televised debate on the theme of “environment, energy and infrastructure”. According to the environmental website Mongabay, both pledged to increase the cultivation of palm oil – the major driver of deforestation in the country. Neither candidate mentioned how they planned to tackle climate change.

Across the country, 41% of people describe themselves as “very concerned” about climate change, according to a poll taken in 2015. This is lower than the proportion of people concerned in neighbouring Vietnam (69%), Malaysia (44%) and the Philippines (72%), but equal to the proportion in the UK.

Paris pledge

Indonesia is part of five negotiating blocs at international climate negotiations. These include the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDCs); the G77 and China; the Coalition for Rainforest Nations; the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Cartagena Dialogue. (More information on each group is available in an in-depth explainer of negotiating blocs by Carbon Brief.)

The country’s annual greenhouse gas emissions were 2.4bn tonnes of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e) in 2015, according to data compiled by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). The figure includes emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). Indonesia’s emissions represented 4.8% of the world’s total global emissions for that year.

Its per-capita emissions were 9.2 tonnes of CO2e that year – larger than the global average (7.0 tonnes of CO2e) and the average in China (9.0 tonnes of CO2e), the UK (7.7 tonnes of CO2e) and the EU (8.1 tonnes of CO2e).

However, it is worth noting that Indonesia’s total emissions vary widely from year to year, largely as a result of variable peatland “megafires”.

The chart below, which is taken from Indonesia’s latest biennial report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), gives an idea of how the country’s peatland fires can shift overall emissions.

The chart shows emissions from peatland fires (blue), forestry and other land use (“FOLU”; green), waste (yellow), agriculture (pale green), industry (“IPPU”; red) and energy (orange). (It is worth noting that the figures shown are self-reported.)

Indonesia’s climate pledge (“nationally determined contribution”, or NDC) targets a 29-41% reduction in emissions by 2030, compared to “business as usual”. The upper end of this range, conditional on “support from international cooperation”, would see emissions in 2030 remain at or below recent levels.

This pledge was submitted to the UNFCCC in the lead up to the Paris climate conference. Indonesia ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016.

The country aims to decarbonise its economy “in a phased approach” – namely, through policies for “improved land use and spatial planning, energy conservation and the promotion of clean and renewable energy sources, and improved waste management”.





This pledge has been rated “highly insufficient” by Climate Action Tracker (CAT), an independent research project tracking climate policies. The rating suggests that Indonesia is not committing its “fair share” to the emissions cuts needed to limit global warming to less than 2C. If all countries had similar targets, temperatures would reach 3-4C by 2100, the analysis finds.

Indonesia’s emissions have increased at a faster rate than expected in recent years, CAT says, and, under current policies, “might even double by 2030”, when compared to 2014 levels.

Deforestation, palm oil and fire

Indonesia contains 10% of the world’s tropical rainforests and 36% of its tropical peatlands.

Tropical peatlands are wet and swampy forested environments with soil that can hold up to 20 times more carbon than other types of mineral soil. It is estimated that Indonesia’s peatlands hold around 28bn tonnes of carbon – the equivalent of nearly three years of global fossil fuel emissions.

Indonesia also accounts for 53% of the world’s palm-oil cultivation, a product ubiquitous in packaged food, fuels and cosmetics. It is the country’s third most profitable export after coal and petroleum, and the industry employs an estimated 3.7 million people.

The thirst for palm oil has transformed the country’s landscape. From 2000 to 2015, Indonesia lost an average of 498,000 hectares of forest each year – making it the world’s second biggest deforester after Brazil.

Much of this past deforestation involved “slash and burn” clearing, which has played a large role in driving polluting megafires across the country’s peatlands. When fires rip across peatlands, much of their vast stores of carbon are released into the atmosphere.

The practice of draining peatlands has also heightened the risk of megafires. In order to grow palm oil and other crops, such as timber, peatlands are often drained of their natural moisture – leaving them dry and more likely to catch alight.

In 2015, the number of peatland fires spiked – causing greenhouse gas release on the same scale as Brazil’s total annual emissions. On some days, Indonesia’s fire emissions alone were higher than those from the entire US economy. (The fires in 2015 were fanned further by hot dry conditions as a result of the natural climate phenomenon El Niño.)

The smoke from the fires led to 19 deaths and caused up to half a million people to suffer from respiratory illness, the Guardian reported at the time.

That year, changes to land-use, peatlands and forests accounted for 79% of Indonesia’s total greenhouse gas emissions.

In the wake of the deadly haze, Widodo announced a nationwide moratorium on the draining of Indonesia’s peatlands. He later set up the Peatlands Restoration Agency and tasked it with restoring 2m hectares of tropical peatlands by 2020.

From 2016 to 2017, forest loss in Indonesia fell by 60% – in part due to the moratorium, analysts say.

In September 2018, Widodo issued a presidential instruction to place a moratorium on new permits for palm plantations for three years.

However, “threats remain”, analysts say. More than a quarter of the peatlands put under protection in 2015 had already been auctioned off to palm oil and timber firms. To compensate these companies, the government is operating a “land swap” scheme, offering firms access to unprotected land. Some groups warn this could clear the way for more deforestation.

This year, the European Union tightened its rules on biofuels in an attempt to limit the use of palm oil linked to deforestation – a move that was bitterly opposed by Indonesian ministers.

A recent investigation by Unearthed uncovered evidence suggesting that Indonesian ministers had tried to pressurise European countries, including the UK, into opposing the rule change. The investigation also found that, in 2016, France scrapped a proposed tax on unsustainable supplies of palm oil after being warned it could lead to the execution of a French citizen in Indonesia.

Coal

Indonesia is the world’s fifth largest producer of coal and is home to the world’s 10th largest coal reserves, according to the latest BP Statistical Review of World Energy.

Around 80% of Indonesia’s coal is exported, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). From 2000 to 2014, Indonesia’s coal exports quadrupled, Carbon Brief analysis shows.

In 2017, Indonesia overtook Australia to become the world’s largest exporter of thermal coal, which is used for power generation, according to the IEA.

China is the primary buyer of Indonesian coal and received 31% of its exports in 2017, says the IEA. Other key customers include India, Japan and South Korea.

Coal mining has many environmental impacts in Indonesia. For example, the shipping of mined coal from Kalimantan has destroyed “hundreds of square metres” of tropical coral reefs, according to Greenpeace.

Around 58% of Indonesia’s electricity was generated by coal in 2017. This is shown on the chart below (black area).





Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts

The country ranks 10th in the world for total coal capacity (29,307 megawatts), but fifth for planned capacity (24,691MW).

However, it is worth noting that Indonesia has repeatedly scaled back its planned coal capacity. In 2015, Indonesia had plans for 45,000MW of new coal. This figure later fell to 34,000MW in 2018 and again to around 25,000MW this year, according to data from Global Energy Monitor.

In its latest report on the global coal market, the IEA identifies Indonesia as a major driver of rising demand over the next five years. It says demand for coal-fired power in the country is likely to increase as a result of “robust economic growth, a rising population and an expanding middle class”.

In 2015, Widodo unveiled an ambitious plan to develop 35,000MW of new power by 2019 – in part to address the “electrification gap” between the country’s wealthy islands, such as Bali, Java and Sumatra, and its smaller, more isolated islands. (The target was later pushed back to 2024.)





Interactive map of historical and planned coal power plants in Indonesia and South East Asia

The government sees coal-fired power as a “cheap and easy” way to help meet its target, according to the Financial Times.

(However, analysis by Carbon Tracker found it could become cheaper to build new renewables than new coal between 2020 and 2022, with new renewables becoming cheaper than existing coal by 2028.)

In March 2018, officials capped the price of domestic coal for power stations for two years – a move intended to help keep electricity prices low around the time of this year’s election, analysts say.

Coal has not been a major talking point in Widodo’s campaign for reelection, according to Mongabay. However, his rival Prabowo has called for coal use to be slashed and replaced with renewables, according to the Jakarta Post.

Renewables

Just 5% of Indonesia’s electricity came from renewables in 2017 – the vast majority of this from geothermal sources. However, the government has pledged to source 23% of its power from renewables by 2025 and 31% by 2050.

Indonesia is the world’s second largest producer of geothermal power after the US.

The country has installed 1,925MW of geothermal power. However, its untapped geothermal resources are estimated to total 29,000MW – 40% of the world’s total geothermal reserves.

Indonesia is a hotspot for geothermal resources because of its volcanic activity. It sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is home to 139 volcanoes, according to the Global Volcanism Program.

The country aims to have 7,200MW of geothermal energy by 2025, which would make it the biggest geothermal producer in the world.

Widodo opened the country’s first wind power farm in July 2018. The Sidrap Wind Farm, the largest of its kind in southeast Asia, produces 75MW of electricity and supplies power to Sulawesi, an island east of Borneo. A second 72MW wind farm is currently under construction on the island.

The country currently has just 16MW of solar power, according to statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

However, the government aims to have 6,400MW of solar and 1,800MW of wind by 2025, according to a report from IRENA.

Yet Indonesia “could feasibly exceed its current goals and deploy even more renewables”, the report says. If policies were adjusted, Indonesia could achieve its 2050 renewables target by 2030, it concludes.

The analysis notes that the potential of solar power is particularly underestimated by current government policy. With new policies and investment, solar has the potential to “provide electricity to nearly 1.1m households in remote areas that currently lack adequate access to electricity”, it says.

Climate laws

Indonesia’s legal system is based on Roman-Dutch law, custom and Islamic law. A wide range of legislation is produced and exists in a hierarchy. This hierarchy is as follows (in order of importance): the 1945 constitution; MPR resolution; law; government regulation substituting a law; government regulation; presidential decree; regional regulation.

Much of Indonesia’s climate-related legislation is directed towards tackling emissions from the forest sector. Such laws, discussed in more detail above, include moratoriums on the draining of peatlands and the conversion of primary rainforest.

In September 2018, Widodo issued a presidential decree to place a moratorium on new permits for palm plantations for three years.

The energy sector is also subject to climate-related regulations. The government issued a regulation in 2014 which contained a pledge to source 23% of its power from renewables by 2025 and 31% by 2050 – up from 5% today.

Indonesia has targets to improve energy efficiency. Its National Master Plan for Energy Conservation (RIKEN) sets a goal of decreasing energy intensity by 1% annually until 2025.

In October 2017, the government announced a new initiative aimed at incorporating climate action into the country’s development agenda. (The country has four separate five-year development plans spanning the period 2005-2025).

The country’s National Medium Term Development Plan for 2015-19 says that a “green economy” should be at the foundation of Indonesia’s development.

This plan targets the eradication of illegal logging, fishing and mining and increased participation of local people in forest management. It also sets out aims to increase vulnerable communities’ resilience to climate change impacts.

It specifically targets emissions cuts from five “priority sectors”, including forestry and peatlands, agriculture, energy and transportation, industrial and waste.

On 25 March 2019, the government launched a report looking at how climate action can be incorporated into the country’s development plan for 2020-25.

The report finds that a “low carbon” development pathway could drive a GDP growth rate of 6% a year until 2045, higher than the rate expected under a “business-as-usual” pathway. This path could also cut emissions by 43% by 2030, when compared to “business-as-usual” – exceeding the country’s current national climate targets.

Climate finance

Indonesia has pledged to cut its emissions by 29-41% by 2030, in comparison to “business as usual” – but the top end of this pledge is conditional on “support from international cooperation”.

The pledge did not, however, specify how much aid it would need to reach the upper end of its target. A separate government document published at the time reported that meeting the country’s renewable energy target alone would cost $108bn.

Indonesia is a major emerging market economy, but its population faces steep financial inequality. A report by Oxfam in 2017 found Indonesia’s four richest men now have more wealth than 100 million of the country’s poorest people.

Analysis by Carbon Brief suggests that Indonesia is the world’s sixth largest recipient of climate finance, having received an average of $952m a year from 2015-16.

Further Carbon Brief analysis shows that, by 2016, Indonesia had been awarded $362m in investment from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Climate Investments Fund (CIF).

Notable schemes financed by the multilateral climate funds include a $150m project to develop private sector geothermal energy and $18m for a community-led project to tackle forest degradation.

Impacts and adaptation

As a highly populous nation spread across a chain of tropical islands, Indonesia is considered to be highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

Sea level rise threatens the 42 million people who live less than 10m above sea level in Indonesia. A one-metre rise in sea levels could inundate 405,000 hectares of Indonesia’s coastal land and cause low-lying islands to disappear.

The country’s capital, Jakarta – which is home to 10 million people – is acutely threatened by sea level rise and has been described as the “fastest sinking city” on Earth. The threat of sea level rise has been compounded in the city by illegal well digging, which is causing the ground to plummet.

Increased rainfall is projected for most of Indonesia’s islands, except for its southern islands, including Java, where it is projected to decline by up to 15%.

Rainfall increases and decreases could boost the risk of flash flooding and droughts, respectively. Indonesia’s megacities are particularly vulnerable to flash flooding, which can trigger devastating landslides.

The timing of the country’s annual monsoon could also be impacted by climate change. Research suggests the risk of a 30-day delay to the monsoon could reach 40% by 2050, compared to 18% today. This could have large consequences for agricultural production.

Carbon Brief analysis finds that average temperatures on Indonesia’s islands have already risen by around 1.2-1.5C since the start of the industrial era.

Increased temperatures – in addition to changes in the natural climate phenomenon El Niño – could further raise the risk posed by forest fires. As well as accelerating climate change, fires pose a risk to Indonesia’s biodiversity. Indonesia is home to 12% of the world’s mammal species, 16% of its reptile species and 17% of its bird species.

Indonesia launched its National Action Plan on Climate Change Adaptation (RAN-API) in 2012. In the foreword of the report, Endah Murniningtyas, former deputy minister for natural resources and environmental affairs, wrote:

“As the largest archipelago nation in the world, Indonesia is one of the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change.”

The report outlines a plan to improve Indonesia’s resilience to climate change, namely by taking measures to improve energy and food security and to boost the resilience of its forest ecosystems. The report also identifies small islands, coastal regions and cities as “special areas” that most require stronger adaptation measures.

Cyclone leaves trail of destruction

MAPUTO/HARARE • Mozambique started three days of national mourning yesterday after a powerful cyclone and flooding killed hundreds of people and left a trail of destruction across swathes of southeast Africa.

Cyclone Idai hit Mozambique's port city of Beira with winds of up to 170kmh last Thursday, then moved inland to Zimbabwe and Malawi, flattening buildings and putting the lives of millions of people in danger.

Drone footage showed residents of a shantytown at the port still picking through wreckage days after the storm hit and trying to drag plastic sheeting over their ruined homes.

The film, released by the Red Cross, showed the settlement pockmarked with empty plots where the winds had blown whole buildings from their foundations.

""Great floods have sowed mourning and devastation in various areas of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi,"" Pope Francis said yesterday. ""I express my pain and closeness to those dear people.""

Mozambique's President Filipe Nyusi said a day earlier that the cyclone had killed more than 200 people in his country but rescuers were still discovering more bodies.

In neighbouring Zimbabwe, the official death count stands at 98 but is likely to grow as hundreds are still missing.

In the worst-hit eastern parts of Zimbabwe, grieving families rushed to bury their dead because the cyclone has knocked out power supplies and stopped mortuaries from functioning.

Malawi has not released details of any casualties from the storm, which weakened as it moved further inland over the weekend, leaving heavy rains in its wake.

International aid groups raced yesterday to rescue survivors and meet spiralling humanitarian needs, saying they were struggling to reach many survivors trapped in remote areas of Mozambique surrounded by wrecked roads and submerged villages.

""We've thousands of people... in roofs and trees waiting for rescue,"" Ms Caroline Haga, spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross, said in the storm-ravaged Mozambican city of Beira. ""We are running out of time. People have been waiting for rescue for more than three days now,"" she said.

Unicef estimated that 260,000 children were at risk there. ""Challenges remain in terms of the search and rescue of thousands of people, including children,"" the agency said.

Beira, a low-lying coastal city of 500,000 people, is home to Mozambique's second-largest port and serves as a gateway to landlocked countries in the region.

There were food and fuel shortages in parts of central Mozambique because Beira is cut off by road, local media reported.

Zimbabwe's Grain Millers Association said 100 trucks carrying wheat destined for Zimbabwe were stuck in Beira.

Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa was yesterday due to visit the worst-affected areas. Both Mozambique and Zimbabwe have declared a state of emergency in some areas.

The floods also brought the threat of waterborne diseases, said aid group Doctors Without Borders.

""People are using well water with no chlorination, and that water is unlikely to be clean and safe to drink... Pneumonia and other respiratory diseases are going to be a problem,"" Mr Gert Verdonck, an emergency coordinator with the charity said from Beira.

The European Union announced on Tuesday an initial emergency aid package of €3.5 million (S$5.4 million) to Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe for emergency shelters, hygiene, sanitation and healthcare.

Britain and the United Arab Emirates have also pledged aid.

Indonesia's Papua

Mass burials planned as death toll tops 100

JAKARTA • Indonesia's eastern-most province of Papua is planning to hold mass burials for the victims of flash floods, as the death toll from the disaster rose to 104 yesterday, with nearly 10,000 people displaced, the National Disaster Management Agency said.

The floods and landslides injured 160 people, 85 of them seriously, while 79 people were missing, said Mr Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.

After consulting families and churches, a mass funeral for the victims would be held today, he said.

The floods and landslides struck during the weekend, near the provincial capital of Jayapura, after torrential rain fell across the Cyclops mountain range, much of which has been stripped of trees by villagers chopping firewood and farmers cultivating plantations.

Disaster authorities had warned provincial officials of the danger of flash floods due to deforestation.

Hundreds of homes, bridges, schools and other public facilities were destroyed.

More than 2,300 personnel have been deployed to search for the missing victims and to clean up debris.

Fourteen excavators had been deployed to help clear blocked roads, while temporary bridges were also being built in some areas after access had been cut.

The nearly 10,000 displaced people were scattered across 18 relief shelters and they would be moved to six camps to help streamline aid distribution, the spokesman said.

Flooding is common in Indonesia. In January, floods and landslides killed at least 70 people on Sulawesi island, while earlier this month hundreds in West Java province were forced to evacuate when torrential rains triggered severe flooding.

US Midwest

No respite yet from rain and melted snow

ATLANTA • The flooding that devastated the US Midwest is likely to last into next week, as rain and melted snow flow into Kansas, Missouri and Mississippi, the National Weather Service (NWS) said.

Floods driven by melting snow in the Dakotas will persist even as Nebraska and Iowa dig out from storms that have killed four people, left one missing and caused more than US$1 billion (S$1.35 billion) in damage to crops, livestock and roads.

""It's already not looking good downstream for the middle and lower Mississippi and Missouri (rivers) into Kansas, Mississippi and Missouri,"" Mr Bob Oravec, a meteorologist with the NWS' Weather Prediction Centre, said yesterday.

The floodwaters have inundated a swathe of Iowa and Nebraska along the Missouri River, North America's longest river. Half of Iowa's 99 counties have declared a state of emergency.

About 25mm of rain is predicted for Saturday in the region, Mr Oravec said. ""It's not a lot, but any precipitation is bad right now.""

US Vice-President Mike Pence toured some parts of Nebraska on Tuesday and promised to help expedite federal help to the region.

Nebraska, Iowa, Wisconsin and Mississippi all declared a state of emergency after the floods, which stemmed from a powerful winter hurricane last week.

The flooding killed livestock, destroyed grains and soya beans in storage, and cut off access to farms because of road and rail damage.

The authorities said they had rescued nearly 300 people in Nebraska alone, with some rivers continuing to rise.

Rescuers could be seen in boats pulling pets from flooded homes.

Some roadways crumbled to rubble and sections of others were submerged. In Hamburg, Iowa, floodwaters covered buildings.

Indonesia flash flood death toll rises to 89, dozens still missing

At least 89 people are known to have died after flash floods and landslides tore through Indonesia’s Papua region, with the toll expected to rise further as rescuers hunt for dozens still missing, the national disaster agency said on Tuesday.

Many have also been injured in the disaster, triggered by torrential rain on Saturday, with some 6,800 people evacuated to temporary shelters.

The military has taken up the grim task of putting mud-caked corpses into body bags, with the search hampered by mountains of debris including rocks and fallen trees.

Seventy-four people remain unaccounted for, while around 150 suffered broken bones, cuts and other injuries.

“Many people are choosing to stay at shelters because they’re still traumatised and scared of more flash floods, so some evacuation centres are packed,” said national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.

The government has issued a 14-day state of emergency in Papua, which shares a border with independent Papua New Guinea on an island just north of Australia.

Flooding is common in Indonesia, especially during the rainy season which runs from October to April.

In January, floods and landslides killed at least 70 people on Sulawesi island, while earlier this month hundreds in West Java province were forced to evacuate when torrential rains triggered severe flooding.

Meanwhile, three people were killed – including two Malaysian tourists – and some 182 were injured after an earthquake on Sunday triggered a landslide on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, next to Bali.

Lombok was rocked by several earthquakes last summer, killing more than 500 people and leaving over 150,000 homeless.

Last September, the country was hit by an earthquake and tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi island which killed around 2,200 people.

The Southeast Asian archipelago of some 17,000 islands is one of the most disaster-prone nations on Earth, straddling the Pacific Ring of Fire, where tectonic plates collide.

Extreme weather is becoming more frequent in various parts of the world. The United States, for instance, has been experiencing extreme cold, with the air temperature in Minnesota recently plummeting to minus 49 degrees Celsius, a temperature typically associated with the North Pole.

In Chile, meanwhile, the driest area in the Andes mountain region is flooded. Some regions of Indonesia have also been experiencing extreme weather. North Sulawesi saw incessant heavy rain for a few days and West Java was hit by floods and landslides. Experts indicate that the more frequent extreme weather events are a result of climate change.

As an archipelagic country lying on the so-called Ring of Fire, Indonesia is particularly vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change, and the impacts need to be tackled effectively and systematically.

The Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping Platform for Impact of Regional Events (VAMPIRE) has been upgraded; it now provides easier access to data and estimates in different formats.

Operational Updates

WFP presented a session at the Bureau of Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics (BMKG)’s annual meeting of technical staff from all provinces and presented innovative methodologies for estimating disaster impact. WFP showcased datasets and remote sensing methods that can be used to monitor and assess impact of floods and drought on food security. This presentation is part of a broader capacity development programme aimed at strengthening BMKG’s ability to produce relevant analysis for impact-based early warning and disaster monitoring.

In cooperation with Pulse Lab Jakarta, WFP finalized the upgrade of the Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping Platform for Impact of Regional Events (VAMPIRE). The upgrade focussed on enhancing userexperience by improving the platform’s interactivity.

The system now provides easier access to data upgraded reporting.

In partnership with CARGILL, WFP raised awareness of the national school feeding programme (Progas) in two primary schools in Deli Serdang District of North Sumatera Province. Key stakeholders were sensitised to the main components of Progas (nutrition education, provision of nutritious meals, and community participation). WFP advocated that local governments commit to longer-term funding to improve the programme’s sustainability. WFP also facilitated training sessions to school and district officials on monitoring and preparation of nutritious meals. WFP also conducted a baseline survey that covered the two intervention schools and two control schools. With support from Cargill, Progas will be implemented in the two schools from March 2019 to June 2020.

There has been an increase in the number and intensity of earthquakes in several locations across Indonesia. As part of disaster preparedness, WFP is working with the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) to conduct Logistics Capacity Assessments (LCAs) in several high-risk provinces, as identified by the 2017 Indonesia Disaster Risk Index.

In February, WFP initiated missions to conduct LCAs in West Sumatera. The process involved liaising with key commercial and government logistics actors and assessing critical logistics infrastructures and facilities. Upon completion of the West Sumatera assessment, the next prioritized provinces scheduled for LCA missions are Bengkulu, West Java, Yogyakarta, and Central Java.","Tue, 19 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1260513-WFP-0000103514.png?itok=JPi3xZfu,"['west', 'wfp', 'indonesia', 'disaster', 'sumatera', 'provinces', 'impact', 'schools', 'logistics', 'country', 'analysis', '2019', 'brief', 'progas']",

The country’s disaster mitigation agency said human-caused deforestation exacerbated the scale of the damage.

The flooding and mudslides destroyed buildings and roads in several areas of Jayapura district, in Papua province, on March 17. The district, in the foothills of the Cyclops Mountains, was reportedly drenched by heavy rain for seven hours non-stop.

The rain caused Papua’s biggest lake, Sentani, to overflow, causing flooding in at least nine administrative villages in its vicinity.

By March 19, the death toll from the disaster was reported as 89. Rescuers evacuated more than 6,800 people to temporary shelters and more than 600 houses and buildings were damaged and submerged, according to official data.

As the floodwaters subside, some people have begun returning to their homes to collect what little remains. Kindena Kogoya lost three of her children and her grandmother when a landslide struck her home on the night of March 17. Two other members of her family are still missing.

She described how logs and rocks washed down the slopes by mud “felt like they were flying” toward her house. “All of it went into the house and destroyed everything,” she said. “Our pig pen was washed away. Nothing was left in the house.”

Heavy rainfall and the region’s montane topography were not the only causes for the flash floods and the scale of the subsequent damage, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB), in Jakarta on Tuesday.

Sutopo said 21.5 square kilometers (8.3 square miles) of land there had been deforested and degraded since 2013 for public housing, farmland, and small-scale mining. The area, he said, was supposed to have been off-limits for development as a water catchment zone.

“The topography of Cyclops Mountains is pretty to very steep,” he said. “The downstream is more flat; meanwhile the soil in the upstream area is easily eroded.”

Population pressure is also a likely factor, Sutopo said, given that more than 43,000 people had moved into the area since 2013. The Cyclops Mountains, a coastal range spanning 314 square kilometers of forest, is a designated nature reserve, but human encroachment has become one of its biggest threats.

Logging, land-clearing

Amos Ondikeleuw, the leader of an indigenous Papuan community living at the foot of the range, told Mongabay in 2017 that outsiders were logging the forest and using fire to clear land for farming, encroaching on terrain that his community considered sacred.

The extent of critically damaged lands in the reserve reached 7.2% in 2012 and was expected to increase in the coming years, according to the Jayapura district forestry office. The office also received reports of rivers running dry due to the annual decrease of freshwater discharge in the district.

The government deployed rescue and evacuation teams and emergency aid to the affected areas, Sutopo said. Several hospitals in the area were also reopened by March 19.

Experts say forest degradation in the buffer zone of the Cyclops Mountains contributed to the imbalance in the area’s hydrology and ecology.

“Rock digging near the rivers can reduce the soil’s endurance against pressure,” making it more prone to landslides, said Prihananto Setiadji, a geologist at Cenderawasih University in Jayapura.

Review of zoning plans

The environment ministry has called for a review of zoning plans for housing settlements around the Cyclops Mountains, but denies that the area has suffered a massive incursion by loggers.

“There’s no [large-scale] encroachment because the area is managed by five indigenous communities in a mixed-plantation scheme,” Wiratno, the ministry’s head of natural resources and ecosystem conservation, said in Jakarta. “There are no companies because it’s a very tough terrain.”

Ministry data show that primary forests in the Cyclops Mountains shrank by 10.5% between 2012 and 2017, to 58.4 square kilometers. Secondary forest increased by 9% during the same period to 23 square kilometers. These forests serve as a water catchment during heavy downpours, according to the ministry.

Wiratno attributed the severity of the landslides on the steep slopes in the area. “Even though the forest isn’t degraded, when it’s at a steep angle, coupled with extreme rainfall, it will cause a big impact for the developed [downhill] area there,” he said.

Wiratno said the environment ministry would increase its target for forest and land restoration in Papua to 25 square kilometers from the initial 10 square kilometers, and develop efforts to improve soil and water management in the region. The ministry will also deploy a team to investigate the most recent disaster in Jayapura.

“We will collect the facts as accurately as possible, and try to reconstruct the landslide so we can get a more comprehensive picture of what caused the landslide and what were the contributing factors,” said M. Saparis Sudaryanto, the ministry’s director of watershed planning and evaluation.

Indonesia‘s first subway has opened in the country’s capital, Jakarta. The development is seen as crucial to tackling some of the world’s worst congestion.

Minutes after inaugurating the 16km transit line running south from Jakarta’s downtown on Sunday, President Joko Widodo presided over a groundbreaking ceremony to mark the beginning of the second phase: an eight-kilometre northward line planned for completion by 2024.

The two projects are under way at a cost of $2.6bn.

“Today we will begin a new civilisation by operating the first phase of mass rapid transit in Jakarta,” Widodo told several thousand guests and residents at the inauguration.

Japanese loan

The line that opened on Sunday includes seven elevated and six underground stations built by two consortia of local and Japanese companies.

Passengers can ride for free until the end of the month, after which operator PT MRT Jakarta has said tickets will cost the equivalent of between $0.70 and $1.

Widodo, who is campaigning for re-election, told the crowd that he has instructed Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan to begin the next phase of construction of an east-west line covering a distance of 87km this year.

Jakarta is officially home to about 10 million people, but the population of the greater metropolitan area swells to 30 million.

The project, funded through a loan from the Japan International Cooperation Agency, has been planned since the 1980s, but its construction was hampered by political crises, red tape and funding disagreements.

Widodo was the Jakarta governor when construction finally kicked off in October 2013.

Major losses

JICA has predicted that without a major investment in transportation, Jakarta would be overwhelmed by traffic jams by 2020.

Annual losses from congestion are forecast to reach $6.5bn by next year.

Congestion has relentlessly worsened in the past decade as car ownership rose, squeezing more and more vehicles onto Jakarta’s unchanging road network.

The average peak hour speed has “significantly decreased” to 10km an hour, according to the transport ministry.

It often can take two or more hours to move 5km in some pockets of the city.","Sun, 24 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/635378a034ed40598e1e3d38b6168c40_18.jpeg?fit=999%2C562,"['transit', 'underground', 'subway', 'phase', 'trafficchoked', 'line', 'construction', 'indonesias', 'worlds', 'told', 'widodo', 'opens', 'jakarta', 'worst']",

The disaster-prone country was also hit by an earthquake on Sunday, triggering a landslip that hit a popular waterfall on the tourist island of Lombok, killing at least three people and damaging hundreds of homes.

The worst-hit area from the flooding was Sentani sub-district, where tons of mud, rocks and trees from a landslip on a mountain early on Sunday rolled down to a river that burst its banks, sweeping away residents, National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in the capital, Jakarta.

Floodwaters and landslips destroyed roads and bridges in several areas of Papua province’s Jayapura district following days of torrential rains, hampering rescue efforts, Mr Nugroho said.

“The combination of natural factors and human activities has caused this fatal disaster,” he said.

Mr Nugroho said 79 bodies had been pulled from the mud and wreckage of crumpled homes by Sunday.

Another 74 people were taken to hospital, many with broken bones and head wounds.

Mr Nugroho said the number of dead and injured would likely increase since affected areas had not been reached and rescuers were searching for 43 people reportedly still missing.

“We are overwhelmed by too many injuries,” said Haerul Lee, the head of the Jayapura health office, adding some medical facilities had been hit by power outages. “We can’t handle it alone.”

Papua military spokesman Colonel Muhammad Aidi said rescuers saved two injured infants who had been trapped for more than six hours.

The parents of one of the babies were washed away and died.

Mr Nugroho said rescuers evacuated more than 4,200 people to temporary shelters as more than 600 houses and buildings were damaged and submerged.

Television footage showed hundreds of rescuers and members of the police and military evacuating residents to shelters at a government office.

Others were carrying bodies in black and orange body bags.

Ambulances and vehicles were seen carrying victims on muddy roads to several clinics and hospitals.

Seasonal downpours cause frequent landslips and floods and kill dozens each year in Indonesia, a chain of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile flood plains.

Meanwhile, a moderately strong earthquake triggered a landslip on Lombok island on Sunday.

The US Geological Survey said the quake had a magnitude of 5.5 and struck at a depth of 24km (15 miles).

The earthquake was felt across the island, located next to Bali, panicking residents still recovering from a major quake last August that killed more than 300 people and left thousands homeless.

Sunday’s quake triggered a landslip from Mount Rinjani and hit dozens of tourists at the Tiu Kelep waterfall located in the foothills of the active volcano, said Nugroho, the disaster agency spokesman.

Two Malaysians and a 14-year-old Indonesian boy were killed in the landslip, Mr Nugroho said.

He said rescuers managed to evacuate 22 Malaysians and 14 Indonesians from the waterfall site and 56 others — mostly local surveyors from government institutions, the military and the police — from the mountainous area.

At least 182 people were injured in the quake, including 26 Malaysians, Mr Nugroho said.

About 525 homes were damaged, including 32 that were flattened.–PA","Mon, 18 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.3830164&origw=1440,"['dead', 'landslip', 'dozens', 'mr', 'quake', 'mud', 'triggered', 'nugroho', 'missing', 'indonisia', 'residents', '79', 'injured', 'mudslides', 'rescuers', 'waterfall', 'hit']",

The textile industry is seeking the government’s protection from high growth of imports as the sector could not compete in both domestic and international markets.

According to data from Statistics Indonesia (BPS), export growth in the textile industry has been just 3 percent annually over the last 10 years, while import growth was 20 percent annually in the same period.

Indonesian All Textile Experts Association (IKATSI) chairman Suharno Rusdi said the textile industry was currently in very bad condition because the domestic market was flooded by imported products.

“If it is allowed to happen continuously, it would endanger our textile industry and textile products because we will rely on imported products and the local textile industry will further lose its domestic market,” he said on Monday as quoted by kontan.co.id.

To deal with the issue, Indonesia needed to introduce a law on cloth sovereignty to help the domestic textile industry to develop, Suharno said, adding that the law would not only regulate imports, but also had to offer incentives to support the development of the national textile industry.

“The existence of such a law is urgent for the national industry. IKATSI will struggle to support the birth of such a law,” he said.

Indonesian Filament and Fiber Producers Association (APSyFI) secretary-general Redma Gita Wirawasta made a similar statement, saying the upcoming Idul Fitri celebration should be used as an opportunity by the government to protect local textile products from the storm of imported products.

“In the last five years, Indonesia’s local textiles could not benefit from Idul Fitri because of the entry of thousands of containers of textile products to the Indonesian market,” Redma said, adding that in 2017, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati tried to stop the massive entry of textile products, but it only lasted six months.

Therefore, Redma called on the Trade Ministry to immediately control the entry of textile imports to help the local industry survive.

He also called on President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo to pay attention to the issue because the massive imports of such products had also contributed to the country’s trade deficit.

As the world’s population climbs to 8.5 billion by 2030, the resilience of forests to combat climate change, help mankind end hunger and maintain sustainable communities will be more important than ever.

The United Nations (UN) estimates that forests cover one third of the Earth's land mass, and around 1.6 billion people – including more than 2,000 indigenous cultures – depend on forests for their livelihood, food, fuel, shelter, clothing and medicine. Humans have relied on forests since time immemorial, and its role in keeping our air, soil and water clean cannot be understated.

In recognition of forests’ unique ecological, economic, social and cultural roles, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) celebrated International Day of Forests on Thursday (21 March). Held annually since 2013, it aims to raise more awareness of the most biologically-diverse ecosystem on land which plays host to more than 80 percent of the terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects.

Forest cover defends the planet from detrimental effects of climate change as trees remove carbon dioxide from the air, store carbon and release oxygen into the atmosphere.

Forests also play a vital role in preventing or reducing the risk of natural disasters such as floods and landslides from occurring. Trees prevent floods by increasing water absorption into the ground and averting landslides by helping to bind the soil with their roots, thus stopping soil erosion.

A recent example is last week’s flash floods and landslides in Indonesia’s Papua province which left more than 100 people dead. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesperson for Indonesia’s National Agency for Disaster Management, said that local governments had been warned of the risks of flash floods due to deforestation in the mountains surrounding the affected area, with Jakarta sending seedlings for tree-planting in the area.

Despite the benefits forests offer, global deforestation remains a pressing issue and 13 million hectares of forest area is destroyed annually. In addition, deforestation accounts for 12 to 20 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to climate change.

Forests in ASEAN

Although ASEAN as a grouping is one of the world’s fastest growing economies, the ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity notes that the region’s 200 million hectares of forest cover is still one of its main assets and millions of ASEAN citizens rely on forest products for their livelihood.

“Our forests abound with species that provide ecosystem services to support the region’s growing population, and they are home to millions of plant and animal species that serve as raw materials for businesses and industries,” said Dr. Theresa Mundita S. Lim, Executive Director of the ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity.

The ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity’s flagship programme called ASEAN Heritage Parks (AHP) protects areas of high conservation importance, and the majority of the 44 ASEAN Heritage parks are forests.

Among the most popular eco-tourism attractions are the Khao Yai National Park in Thailand, Mount Makiling Forest Reserve in the Philippines, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve in Singapore and Kinabalu National Park in Malaysia.

Others such as the Nam Ha National Protected Area in Lao, the Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park in Myanmar and the Kon Ka Kinh National Park in Vietnam support agricultural production and electricity generation as well as help supply locals with firewood, honey and rattan.

Action plan

At the regional-level, the Strategic Plan of Action for ASEAN Cooperation on Forestry (2016-2025) stands out for its stance on enhancing the quantity and quality of production with sustainable green technologies, resource management systems and minimising pre and post-harvest losses and waste.

Among its other strategic thrusts include enhancing trade facilitation, economic integration and market access as well as ensuring food security, food safety, better nutrition and equitable distribution.

Increasing resilience to climate change, natural disasters and other shocks, assisting resource constrained small producers and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to improve productivity, technology and product quality to meet global market standards, and increasing competitiveness in line with the ASEAN Policy Blueprint on SME Development are among its other goals.

Ultimately, strengthening ASEAN’s joint approaches to promoting sustainable forest management is a goal Southeast Asia’s governments, companies, organisations and individuals should all strive towards.

More than 174 000 asylum seekers and refugees currently living in:

Thailand (more than 7 600)

Malaysia (more than 155 000)

Indonesia (18 000)

EU humanitarian funding: €4.63 million since 2016

Introduction

Considered safe havens for many, southeast Asian countries, in particular Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, have long hosted considerable numbers of asylum seekers and refugees from various nationalities who seek protection and assistance outside of their home countries. However, the lack of national frameworks to protect asylum seekers and refugees leave many in highly vulnerable situations as they are considered illegal and are therefore often denied the fundamental right to protection.

What are the needs?

Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia are the largest host countries for refugees in southeast Asia. Nonetheless, they are not signatories to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Although these countries may be willing to increase protection space, which will result in a more formalised legal recognition of asylum seekers and refugees, with no national legal protection mechanisms currently in place, they are considered ‘illegal migrants’ and are in need of assistance.

Over the past few years, an unprecedented surge in mixed migratory flows has resulted in growing backlogs of asylum seekers and urban refugees in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Individuals seeking refugee status inevitably face extended waiting times of up to two or three years for the refugee status determination (RSD) process. During this extensive waiting period, they are exposed to a wide range of risks, including detention, exploitation, persecution, and economic hardships as they do not have the right to work. Currently, there are more than 180 000 asylum seekers and refugees living in the three southeast Asian countries, the vast majority of who live in capital cities and urban areas.

Due to their locations, the three countries are also exposed to a wide array of natural disasters, ranging from floods, tropical storms, landslides, droughts, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis to earthquakes.

How are we helping?

In response to the rapidly growing numbers of asylum seekers and refugees in southeast Asia, in 2017 the European Union allocated €1.8 million to enhance humanitarian protection to vulnerable individuals in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

Implemented by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the intervention focuses on the acceleration of the refugee status determination (RSD) process for asylum seekers and refugees in the three countries, with the aim to reduce the massive backlogs of pending RSD cases. The action will result in shorter waiting times, thereby contributing to the improved protection of asylum seekers and refugees, who, devoid of a proper legal status, are exposed to detention and associated protection risks, unequipped to sustain their livelihoods, and face limited access to basic social services. A faster RSD process will also help minimise the psychological impact on asylum seekers who are likely to remain in limbo as long as their status remain unclear. Special attention is being paid to the most vulnerable men, women, and children, particularly those currently in detention. The initiative will directly benefit 13 350 people by the end of the project. Thanks to EU funding, UNHCR has increased its refugee status determination capacity allowing it to adjudicate refugee status determination decisions of nearly 6 000 individuals from July 2016 to June 2017.

EU humanitarian aid has been present in the three countries for more than two decades, providing funding to assist people affected by conflict and natural disasters, such as the 2004 tsunami. When the deadly tsunami struck Indonesia’s Sunda Strait and devastated large parts of nearby coastal areas on 22 December 2018, the EU provided close to €400 000 to provide immediate, life-saving assistance to the most affected families. A humanitarian expert was also deployed to the field to participate in assessments and coordination of the relief efforts while the EU Copernicus satellite mapping service was also activated. Earlier in September 2018, the EU responded to the Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia by providing €1.5 million in emergency aid. The EU Civil Protection mechanism was activated to channel aid from European Member States. Similarly in August 2018, €650 000 was allocated to support communities severely hit by a series of strong earthquakes in the Indonesian island of Lombok.

Since 2013, more than €1.1 million has been allocated to provide emergency humanitarian support to Rohingya and Bangladesh migrants detained in immigration detention centres and shelters in Thailand and Indonesia. From 1995 to 2016, the EU also provided almost €120 million in humanitarian aid to refugees from Myanmar/Burma residing in camps along the border in Thailand, prioritising mainly food assistance and primary healthcare.","Fri, 15 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1259368-thailand_malaysia_and_indonesia_2019-03-15.png?itok=KPUovY8g,"['indonesia', 'protection', 'countries', 'malaysia', 'thailand', 'eu', 'echo', 'humanitarian', '2018', 'refugee', 'refugees', 'asylum', 'factsheet', 'status', 'seekers']",

Mass burials are being planned as the death toll rises from the Sentani flash floods in Indonesia's Papua Province.

Radio NZ reports disaster agency officials said the death toll had climbed again with 104 people now confirmed dead, 160 injured and 79 others still missing.

The National Disaster Management Agency said the number of people displaced by the flooding and landslides had also increased with nearly 10,000 victims sheltering in 18 refuge centres.

Numerous buildings had been severely damaged including nearly 400 houses, five churches, eight schools, 100 shops, four bridges and four roads.

The government has recorded at least 56 deaths and over 500 injuries, as of Wednesday. Forecasters have warned that more rain is on the way.

Many of those affected are in evacuation camps because of floods that have destroyed their houses, damaged roads, washed away bridges and killed livestock.

Weather experts say the flooding was a result of a tropical cyclone that blew in from neighboring Mozambique.

MacDonald Clemence, one of the victims, said it was at midnight while he was fast asleep when he was awakened by the sound of something falling down with a thud. He immediately woke others and found that it was a wall of their house, and immediately sought refuge at a chief’s house until the following morning when they were told to stay at camp set up in Nsanje.

The roaring water which entered his house swallowed almost everything he had, but he managed to escape with his two children.

He said they are now hoping to receive food and blankets, and arrange a place in the upper land where to resettle.

Malawi President Peter Mutharika has declared the 14 affected districts disaster areas and issued an urgent appeal for help.

Francis Kadzokoya, a disaster risk management officer, said many relief items might have to be delivered by air.

“Probably we would want to call upon our mother department to help us with a helicopter so that we should be airlifting some of the relief items to the camps which cannot be accessed by the road,” said Kadzokoya.

Meanwhile, community health workers have been deployed in the camps to treat those in need of medical care and advise people on practices that help prevent outbreaks of infectious diseases.

“I think we would actually do away with the aftermath of these serious disasters like the one we experienced in 2015, and even these we have just experienced in March 2019.”

However, forecasters have warned of another week of steady rain starting March 14 in parts of southern and northern Malawi.

Major air law treaties

To which major air law treaties related to carrier liability for passenger injury or death is your state a party?

Indonesia has ratified and is therefore bound by the following conventions concerning international carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo by air:

Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chicago 1944, as ratified by Indonesia when becoming a state party to the International Civil Aviation Organization;

Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules relating to International Carriage by Air, Warsaw 1929, as ratified by Air Carrier Ordinance No. 100 of 1939;

Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, Tokyo 1963, as ratified by Law No. 2 of 1976;

Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, the Hague 1970, as ratified by Law No. 2 of 1976;

Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Montreal 1971, as ratified by Law No. 2 of 1976;

Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment, Cape Town 2001, as ratified by Government Regulation No. 8 of 2007; and

Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, Montreal 1999, as ratified by Presidential Decree No. 95 of 2016.

International carriage – liability for passenger injury or death

Montreal Convention and Warsaw Convention

Do the courts in your state interpret the similar provisions of the Montreal Convention and the Warsaw Convention in the same way?

To date, there has been no change in the status on the judicial decisions that have been awarded based on the Montreal Convention 1999.

With regard to the implementation of Warsaw Convention, it is important to note that Indonesia does not recognise a stare decisis doctrine. Consequently, a judge has no obligation to follow a previous decision in a similar case; however, according to court precedence, the court has consistently enforced the Warsaw Convention. One remarkable case to date is 1517K/Pdt/2009 dated 9 April 2009 between Singapore Airlines v Sigit Sucahyono (Case 1517), in which the court agreed that the compensation amount is not limited where the accident is caused by wilful misconduct of the carrier.

Do the courts in your state consider the Montreal Convention and Warsaw Convention to provide the sole basis for air carrier liability for passenger injury or death?

As there is no court decision based on the Montreal Convention to date, we can only refer to Case No. 1517, which was decided based on the Warsaw Convention (see question 2). In this case, we can only state that Indonesian courts recognise the existence of international conventions to regulate on air carriers’ liability for passengers’ injury or death.

However, if the international carriage is performed by the domestic carrier, the law that applies is the Indonesian Law No. 1 Year 2009 (Indonesian Aviation Law) regarding Aviation (Indonesian Aviation Law), which is further regulated under the Ministry of Transportation Regulation No. 77 of 2011 on the Liability of Air Carriers (MoTR No. 77/2011), which states that an air carrier will be liable for damages for, among other things, death, permanent disabilities or injuries. It should be noted that the laws only apply to incidents occurring in the airspace above the territory of Indonesia.

Definition of ‘carrier’

In your state, who is considered to be a ‘carrier’ under the Montreal and Warsaw Conventions?

In Case No. 639/Pdt.G/2008/PN.Jkt.Sel between Dono Indarto and Emirates Airlines, the court applied the Warsaw Convention to the case involving an international carriage, which is defined as any carriage whose place of departure, destination and where the contract made is situated within territories of two countries.

There is no precedent where the court extends the term of ‘carrier’ to include ground handling agents.

Carrier liability condition

How do the courts in your state interpret the conditions for air carrier liability - ‘accident’, ‘bodily injury’, ‘in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking’ - for passenger injury or death in article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention and article 17 of the Warsaw Convention?

In Case No. 908/Pdt.G/2007/PN.Jak.Sel between Singapore Airlines and Sigit Suciptoyono, the passenger brought a claim against the carrier, Singapore Airlines, after experiencing a bodily injury in an accident during a flight. The bodily injury claim was supported with evidence of a visum or a testimony from the hospital, the transcript of the black box and the results of the investigation of the flight accident.

The court referred to article 17 of the Warsaw Convention and deemed that the plaintiff had fulfilled the elements for a bodily injury - namely, the existence of an injury and the occurrence of such an injury in the carrier or during the operations of embarking or disembarking.

No negligence defence

How do the courts in your state interpret and apply the ‘no negligence’ defence in article 21 of the Montreal Convention, and the ‘all reasonable measures’ defence in article 20 and the ‘wilful misconduct’ standard of article 25 of the Warsaw Convention?

In Indonesia, the court has never applied the ‘no negligence’ defence, it has only applied the wilful misconduct standard. In Case 1517, the court considered that Singapore Airlines had committed wilful misconduct since the pilot in charge did not follow the instruction from the flight authority in Taiwan, which at that material time prohibited the pilot in charge from landing the aircraft on a runway that was under maintenance.

Advance payment for injury or death

Does your state require that advance payment be made to injured passengers or the family members of deceased passengers following an aircraft accident?

There are no regulations in Indonesia requiring advanced payment to be made to injured passengers or family members of deceased passengers.

Deciding jurisdiction

How do the courts of your state interpret each of the jurisdictions set forth in article 33 of the Montreal Convention and article 28 of the Warsaw Convention?

The court’s interpretation of article 28 of the Warsaw Convention can be seen in Case No. 639/Pdt.G/2008/PN.Jkt.Sel and Case No. 908/Pdt.G/2007/PN.Jak.sel, in which the action for damages may be brought in:

the territory of the parties;

the place of business of the carrier;

the place of business where the contract has been made; or

the place of destination.

In the case, since the domicile of the carrier Emirates is in the United Arab Emirates, and the destination is Jakarta, Indonesia, the district court of Jakarta assumed jurisdiction to adjudicate the case.

Period of limitation

How do the courts of your state interpret and apply the two-year period of limitations in article 35 of the Montreal Convention and article 29 of the Warsaw Convention?

Indonesia applies the two-year period limitation for the passenger to file a lawsuit for damages. However, an exception was applied in Case 1517 that although the accident occurred in 2000, the claim was submitted and accepted in 2007. According to the national law, the claim has been time-barred, yet the court ruled that it may still be accepted because Sigit (the plaintiff) had previously filed the claim before the United States District Court for Central District of California and the High Court of the Republic of Singapore. Hence, albeit that there is such provision regarding the period of limitation, the two-year period of limitation is considered to still be subject to tolling and may be extended to a certain extent. It serves as a reminder, however, that Indonesian courts do not recognise stare decisis doctrine, and consequently, there may be a possibility that Indonesian courts could grant otherwise.

Liability of carriage

How do the courts of your state address the liability of carriage performed by a person other than the contracting carrier under the Montreal and Warsaw Conventions?

To the best of our knowledge, there have never been any previous court decisions in this regard.

Domestic carriage – liability for passenger injury or death

Governing laws

What laws in your state govern the liability of an air carrier for passenger injury or death occurring during domestic carriage?

The applicable provisions for passenger injury or death occurring during domestic carriage are provided in the Indonesian Aviation Law and its implementation regulation, the MoTR No. 77/2011.

Nature of carrier liability

What is the nature of, and conditions, for an air carrier’s liability?

In Indonesia, an air carrier is subject to strict liability under the Indonesian Aviation Law.

Liability limits

Is there any limit of a carrier’s liability for personal injury or death?

The air carrier’s liability for personal injury or death is limited to the amounts stipulated under the law, specifically MoTR No. 77/2011 and to a time limit determined to commence a claim against it. Article 177 of the Indonesian Aviation Law provides that the maximum time limit for the initiation of a legal claim should be within two years from the date on which the baggage is supposed to have arrived at the destination. The elucidation of the law extends such regulation to also include losses in the form of death or injury.

The amount of compensation that should be paid by an air carrier operating domestic carriage in the event of loss is governed by MoTR No. 77/2011 and is as described below.

Legal basis Damage Compensation Article 3 of MoTR No. 77/2011 Death of passenger on air transportation 1.25 billion rupiahs per passenger Death of passenger boarding or disembarking an aircraft at an airport 500 million rupiahs per passenger Total permanent injuries 1.25 billion rupiahs per passenger Injuries and hospitalisation 200 million rupiahs per passenger Article 5 of MoTR No. 77/2011 Missing, destroyed or damaged luggage (that is listed) From 200,000 rupiah per kilogram per passenger up to 4 million rupiahs Article 7 of MoTR No. 77/2011 Missing or destroyed cargo 100,000 rupiahs per kilogram Partly destroyed cargo or cargo contents 50,000 rupiahs per kilogram

Main defences

What are the main defences available to the air carrier?

For liability of lost or damaged baggage, the carrier will not be deemed responsible if it can prove that the loss is not caused by the action of carrier or people employed by the carrier.

For liability cause by damages due to delay, the carrier will be exempted from any liability if it can prove that the delay is caused by weather conditions or technical operations conditions.

Technical operations conditions include factors such as:

the airport for the departure and arrival cannot be used for the air carrier operation;

the surroundings near the airport is experiencing issues such as flooding or fire;

there is a long queue for take-off, landing or during the departure slot time; and

refuelling.

Weather conditions include conditions such as:

rainstorms;

flood;

thunderstorms;

hurricanes;

fog;

smoke;

visibility is below the minimal standard; and

the wind velocity exceeds the maximum standard and has the potential to affect flight safety.

Damages

Is the air carrier’s liability for damages joint and several?

The air carrier’s liability is limited to the damages incurred.

Rule for apportioning fault

What rule do the courts in your state apply to apportioning fault when the injury or death was caused in whole or in part by the person claiming compensation or the person from whom the right is derived?

According to the law, namely article 141 of the Indonesian Aviation Law, the carrier is only liable for indemnity for the death of passengers or defects or injuries caused by incidents on board the aircraft or while getting on or off the aircraft if they are due to the intentional action or fault of the carrier or any of its employees.

The air carrier’s liability for personal injury or death is limited to the amounts stipulated under the law, specifically MoTR No. 77/2011.

Statute of limitations

What is the time within which an action against an air carrier for injury or death must be filed?

As conveyed in questions 9 and 13, the time limit to file a legal action to claim for injury or death is two years from the date the luggage is supposed to arrive. The law is silent regarding whether or not it is subject to tolling although Case 1517 made an exception to the time limit. Also based on precedence, in the case between Willem Tabuni et al v Pilatus Aircraft Limited et al in 2012, the court considered the action to have commenced right after the accident occurred. Further, the court did not consider the out-of-court negotiations as the action that could toll the statute of limitation.

Third-party actions

Seeking recovery

What are the applicable procedures to seek recovery from another party for contribution or indemnity?

The Indonesian Aviation Law provides a legal basis for any carrier to claim a third party causing the damages or loss suffered by the passengers, shippers or cargo beneficiaries that are the carrier’s liability. However, the law is silent regarding the procedures for seeking such recovery.

Time limits

What time limits apply?

The Indonesian Aviation Law is silent regarding the time limit for such claim, thus the time-limit principle in the Indonesian Civil Code, which is 30 years, will apply.

Liability for ground damage

Applicable laws

What laws apply to the liability of the air carrier for injury or damage caused to persons on the ground by an aircraft accident?

There is no specific provision on injury or damage caused to persons on the ground by an aircraft accident. However, if this occurs, the provisions regarding liability of the carrier towards third party will be applied.

Nature and conditions of liability

What is the nature of, and conditions for, an air carrier’s liability for ground damage?

Strict liability.

Liability limits

Is there any limit of carriers’ liability for ground damage?

As mentioned above, there is no specific provision on injury or damage caused to persons on the ground by an aircraft accident. However, if this occurs, the provisions regarding liability of the carrier towards third party will be applied.

Main defences

What are the main defences available to the air carrier in a claim for damage caused on the ground?

Pursuant to article 19 of MoTR 77/2011, a carrier is not liable to pay compensation if it can prove that the incident is not a result of fault or negligence of the carrier or the people it has employed or its agents, and if the incident is caused solely by the fault or negligence of the passenger or third party.

Liability for unruly passengers and terrorist events

Applicable laws

What laws apply to the liability of the air carrier for injury or death caused by an unruly passenger or a terrorist event?

Under Indonesian Aviation Law, there is no such provision concerning the liability of the air carrier for injury or death caused by unruly passenger or a terrorist event. The liability in the case of an unruly passenger or a terrorist event is imposed on the individual.

Nature and conditions of liability

What is the nature of, and conditions, for an air carrier’s liability for injury or death caused by an unruly passenger or a terrorist event?

Even though Indonesian Aviation Law does not provide the conditions for an air carrier’s liability for injury or death caused by unruly passenger or a terrorist event, one may file a claim for injury or death passenger on tort basis. If the air carrier is proven to be at fault, then the air carrier might be held liable by the court.

Liability limits

Is there any limit of liability for injury or death caused by an unruly passenger or a terrorist event?

Not applicable.

Main defences

What are the main defences available to the air carrier in a claim for injury or death caused by an unruly passenger or a terrorist event?

Not applicable.

Consumer protection and passenger rights

Applicable legislation

Summarise aviation-related consumer-protection laws or regulations related to passengers with reduced mobility, flight delays and overbooking, tarmac delay and other relevant areas.

Pursuant to Law No. 8 of 1999 Concerning Consumer Protection (the Consumer Protection Law), there are several passenger rights, which are:

the right to obtain comfort, security and safety in using or consuming goods or services;

the right to choose the goods or services in accordance with the promised conversion value and condition as well as the warranty;

the right to obtain correct, clear, and honest information regarding the condition and warranty of the goods or services;

the right to be heard in expressing opinion and complaints on goods or services they use or consume;

the right to obtain proper advocacy, protection, and settlement in the consumer’s protection dispute;

the right to obtain consumer’s training and education;

the right to receive proper and honest and non-discriminatory treatment or services;

the right to obtain compensation, redress or substitution, if the goods or services received are not in accordance with the agreement or not received as requested; and

the right to obtain rights as regulated in the other provisions of the law.

Any dispute arising under Consumer Protection Law is settled through the Consumer Dispute Resolution Body.

Liability of government entities providing services to carriers

Relevant laws

What laws apply to the liability of the government entities that provide services to the air carrier?

Besides having authority to issue aviation-related licence and as a regulator, the Indonesian Aviation Law sets out liability of government to provide services to the air carrier, among others, as airport authority and navigation services provider.

As for the airport operator, the Indonesian Aviation Law provides that the entities that can be an airport operator are state-owned enterprise, regional government-owned enterprise, and private companies in the form of limited liability companies.

Further, article 271 of Indonesian Aviation Law stipulates the liability of the government entities to provide services to the air carrier, which states that the government shall be responsible for providing flight navigation services for the operating aircraft. The scopes of navigation services are:

air traffic services;

aeronautical telecommunication services;

aeronautical information services;

aeronautical meteorological services; and

search and rescue.

Nature and conditions of liability

What is the nature of, and conditions for, the government’s liability?

Article 240 (1) of Indonesian Aviation Law provides a legal basis for liability of an airport operator towards the damages of the airport user including death, injury, loss of equipment or environmental damages. The nature of, and condition for, the government’s liability is strict liability. Further, the Indonesian Aviation Law states that the liability of the airport operator will be further regulated by the Minister of Transportation Regulation. However, up until now, the said regulation has not yet been enacted.

Liability limits

Are there any limitations to seeking recovery from the government entity?

Generally, every action and decision taken or made by the government entity should comply with the prevailing laws as well as General Principles of Good Governance as stipulated under Law No. 30 of 2014 regarding Government Administration.

Criminal proceedings

Responsibility for accidents

Can an air carrier be criminally responsible for an aviation accident?

Yes, the corporate crime principle is applied under article 441 of the Indonesian Aviation Law. One of the provisions that might be imposed against the air carrier are articles 411 and 412 of the Indonesian Aviation Law. Those articles stipulate that anybody who operates the aircraft which is intentionally endangering the safety of the aircraft; or any individual on board an aircraft conducting any wrongdoing that may endanger aviation safety can be imposed to the air carrier.

Effect of proceedings

What is the effect of criminal proceedings against the air carrier on a civil action by the passenger or their representatives?

Pursuant to Supreme Court Regulation No. 1 of 1956 and Supreme Court Circular Letter No. 4 of 1980, a criminal proceeding can be suspended if there is a civil action that should be decided first by the court.

Compensation

Can claims for compensation by passengers or their representatives be made against the air carrier through the criminal proceedings?

Compensation claim by passenger or their representatives can be made against the air carrier through civil action. However, the civil action can be taken during the criminal proceedings in the same trial as stipulated under article 98 of the Indonesian Criminal Procedure Code, which allows a victim to sue for a compensation for the loss arising from the crime.

Effect of carrier's conditions of carriage and tariffs

Liability

What is the legal effect of a carrier’s conditions of carriage or tariffs on the carrier’s liability?

If the carrier’s condition is contrary with the prevailing law, then the said law will prevail.

Damages

Damage recovery

What damages are recoverable for the personal injury of a passenger?

The damages are recoverable for the personal injury of a passenger if such physical injury of human being is a result of the air carrier operation. Punitive damages are allowed in this matter. The injured passenger is the person who has standing to claim and becomes the beneficiary of the punitive damages. Pursuant to article 3 of MoTR No. 77/2011, the amount of compensation that will be paid by an air carrier in the event of the death passenger is as follows:

compensation for total permanent injuries amounts to 1.25 billion rupiahs per passenger; and

compensation for injuries and hospitalisation amounts to 200 million rupiahs per passenger.

The heir of the passenger who died has standing to claim and becomes the beneficiary. Pursuant to article 3 of MoTR No. 77/2011, the amount of compensation that shall be paid by an air carrier in the event of the death passenger is as follows.

compensation for the death of a passenger on air transportation is a 1.25 billion rupiahs per passenger; and

compensation for the death of a passenger boarding or disembarking an aircraft at an airport is 200 million rupiahs per passenger.

Accident investigation and family assistance

Investigatory authority

Who is responsible in your state for investigating aviation accidents?

The National Transportation Safety Committee is responsible for investigating aviation accidents.

Disclosure restrictions

Set forth any restrictions on the disclosure and use of accident reports, flight data recorder information of cockpit voice recordings in litigation.

Pursuant to the explanation of article 359, paragraph (2) of the Indonesian Aviation Law, there are several accident-investigation reports that cannot be disclosed to the public, which are:

statements from the investigated persons;

communication recording or transcript between people who are engaged in aircraft operations;

information on health or personal information from people who are involved in the accidents or incidents;

voice recording in the cockpit (cockpit voice recorder) and its transcript;

recording and transcript of air traffic services conversations; and

opinions expressed in the information analysis including the flight data recorder.

The aviation accident investigation reports above also cannot be used as an evidence in court proceedings.

Relevant post-accident assistance laws

Does your state have any laws or regulations addressing the provision of assistance to passengers and their family after an aviation accident?

At this juncture, the regulations addressing the provision of assistance to passengers and their family after an aviation accident is only for the accident that occurred within and nearby (maximum 8km) the airport area. It is regulated under the General Director of Aviation of Ministry of Transportation No. KP.378 of 2001 on the Airport Emergency Plan Document. Based on the said regulation, assistance for passengers and their family, among other things, includes:

establishing an emergency crisis centre;

providing passenger data;

establishing a conference room; and

establishing a meet-and-greet room.

In addition to the above, in best practice, when aviation accident occurs there are also other forms of assistance toward the passenger or family of the passenger, namely provision of psychologist to give free consultation (this service is provided by the carrier or volunteer), flight services, hotel, shuttle to the emergency crisis centre and any other accommodation.

Insurance requirements

Mandatory requirements

Are there mandatory insurance requirements for air carriers?

Yes, the insurance requirements are mandatory for air carriers based on article 62 of the Indonesian Aviation Law.

Litigation procedure

Court structure

Provide a brief overview of the court structure as it relates to civil aviation liability claims and appeals.

The court structure in Indonesia is stipulated under Law No. 49 of 2009 regarding the General Court (General Court Law). Based on General Court Law, the district court is the court of first instance that examines and review the facts and law from both the plaintiff and defendant’s submission. The district court decision can be appealed to the High Court. Similar to the district court, both law and facts presented by the plaintiff and defendant will be reviewed by High Court judges. The losing party in High Court can seek cassation from the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court judges will only review law-related issues. The Supreme Court decision is final and binding. However, there is an extraordinary legal remedy, which is a civil review. A petition for civil review will not suspend the enforcement of the court’s judgment.

Allowable discovery

What is the nature and extent of allowable discovery/disclosure?

There is no provision regarding the discovery or disclosure under Indonesian procedural law.

Evidence

Does the law of your state provide for any rules regarding preservation and spoliation of evidence?

No, there is no regulation concerning the preservation and spoliation of evidence.

Recoverability of fees and costs

Are attorneys’ fees and litigation costs recoverable?

Pursuant to article 379 of the Indonesian Civil Procedure Law, the attorneys’ fees are not recoverable. However, the court fees are usually imposed by the judges on the losing party of such dispute.

Judgments and settlement

Pre and post-judgment Interest

Does your state impose pre-judgment or post-judgment interest? What is the rate and how is it calculated?

Indonesia does not impose pre-judgment or post-judgment interest.

Settlements

Is court approval required for settlements?

No, the court approval is not required for settlements. However, if the settlement occurs inside the court (by submission of a claim), the judge will confirm the settlement deed through a decision on the settlement. This settlement deed resembles a final and binding court judgment that cannot be appealed.

What is the effect of a settlement on the right to seek contribution or indemnity from another person or entity? Can it still be pursued?

It may be pursued since the settlement agreement only bound to the parties who sign the agreement. This condition is based on article 1340 of the Indonesian Civil Code, which states that an agreement applies only to the parties who enter into it.

Are there any financial sanctions, laws or regulations in your state that must be considered before an air carrier or its insurer may pay a judgment or settlement?

One of the most important things before proceeding with the delivery of compensation to the passenger or his or her heirs is to ensure that the beneficiary is the rightful person according to the relevant regulation related to the Heritage Law.","Wed, 27 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-facebook.png,"['indonesia', 'indonesian', 'law', 'carrier', 'air', 'passenger', 'aviation', 'liability', 'injury', 'death', 'court']", 
36,36,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Water sharing in Indonesia key to smothering transboundary haze - East Asia Forum,https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2019/03/14/water-sharing-in-indonesia-key-to-smothering-transboundary-haze/,"Authors: Michelle Ann Miller and Zu Dienle Tan, NUS

With 2019 expected to bring hotter and drier-than-usual El Niño weather conditions to Southeast Asia, concerns are heightened about a recurrence of the 2015 haze crisis. The episode of chronic transboundary air pollution that choked the region in a blanket of acrid smoke had severe health, economic and environmental impacts.

Indonesia, a major haze-producing country, claims to be better prepared for the next intense dry season, expected to start in June this year. Indonesia’s confidence is linked to major land reforms undertaken in the aftermath of the 2015 haze crisis. In 2016, President Joko Widodo introduced a moratorium on burning, draining and deforesting 4.9 million hectares of peatlands, amending a 2014 regulation.

The primary source of transboundary haze comes from biomass burning in peat swamps. When naturally saturated peat swamps are drained for plantation agriculture, they become highly flammable in the dry season months of June to September, increasing the risk of biomass fires that release massive quantities of carbon into the atmosphere.

While Indonesia is taking strides to restore the health of degraded peat ecosystems, current legislation contains major oversights that are igniting new problems in government efforts to combat transboundary haze. There is a critical lack of knowledge about the role of water in preventing and suppressing deep peat fires. At the same time, the government’s zero-burning policy invalidates indigenous knowledge of controlled burning practices that is needed to adapt to the rapidly changing hydrological conditions of Indonesia’s peatlands.

Indonesia’s Riau province on the central east coast of Sumatra is a leading perpetrator and victim of transboundary haze. Half of the province is composed of peatlands. Riau also hosts two-thirds of Indonesia’s pulp and paper production, covering around 1.7 million hectares, along with more than 2.4 million hectares of palm oil plantations.

When companies with global operations build dams upstream of communities, they often expose neighbouring peatland communities to harsher seasonal variations in the form of droughts and floods. The closure of company dam sluice gates in the dry season for retaining water on their concessions reduces the flow of water to smallholder farmers and communities, creating localised hotspots of heightened fire risk. Without readily available water, many peatland communities are left unprepared to effectively respond to haze-inducing wildfires. In the rainy season, when plantation companies open their dam gates, they release excessive rainwater that floods surrounding communities.

Inter-seasonal changes in water availability are encouraging fishermen to work in the dry season. Their discarded cigarettes on combustible biomass have become a commonly cited cause of haze-belching wildfires.

The government has so far adopted a hands-off approach in dealing with water-sharing issues between companies and communities. No big plantation company has been prosecuted for withholding water from adjacent communities. Nor have major perpetrators of groundwater pollution been brought to justice for leaking pesticides and fertilisers into communities that bear the cumulative burden of public health problems.

Overlooking the underlying problem of water sharing will exacerbate existing tensions between companies and communities. If water-sharing arrangements cannot be fairly resolved, the use of fire as a weapon to express grievances is likely to contribute to future episodes of transboundary haze.

The inability of peatland communities to optimally function under conditions of dry season water shortages fuels government and company narratives that local people are incapable of managing their own resources. Yet the current government ban on the use of fire for clearing land has delegitimised traditional controlled burning practices, which are now punishable by jail terms and hefty fines.

For generations, indigenous groups such as the Dayaks of Central and West Kalimantan have practiced controlled burning to remove excess biomass, destroy pests and prepare land for planting. Likewise, farmers in Riau’s Bengkalis Regency used to create fire breaks before the fire ban by felling trees within a given perimeter and herding fire into the centre of an enclosure to contain it. Before and during burning in the late wet season, farmers knew that they needed to remain mindful of wind strength and direction to minimise the chance of uncontrolled flames.

Failure to distinguish between safe burning and uncontrolled or accidental fires impedes the capacity of communities to sustainably adapt to the rapidly changing hydrological landscape of Indonesia’s drained peat swamps. By targeting peatland communities, Indonesia’s current anti-haze legislation is missing the root cause of the problem, which rests heavily on unequal water-sharing arrangements.

Both water and fire knowledge must be shared in ways that are inclusive of peatland communities if governance efforts to deal with predicted El Niño conditions are to succeed. As a starting point, existing water-sharing arrangements between companies and communities that incubate dry season hotspots must be pushed toward fairer resolution.

Without greater attention to the nuances in how peatland communities manage their own fire and water resources, government efforts to combat transboundary haze are unlikely to succeed in the longer term.

37,37,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Why Malawi is failing to protect people from floods and what needs to be done - The Conversation CA,https://theconversation.com/why-malawi-is-failing-to-protect-people-from-floods-and-what-needs-to-be-done-113794,"Severe floods in Malawi have affected about a million people and claimed 56 lives.

This isn’t uncommon in the country. Between 1946 and 2013, floods accounted for 48% of major disasters, and their frequency and severity is increasing. They have occurred in 16 out of the country’s 28 districts, in both rural and urban areas. The Lower Shire Valley in southern Malawi, bordering Mozambique, composed of Chikwawa and Nsanje Districts is the most flood prone and affected area.

Floods stifle development efforts at every level. They affect many sectors from agriculture to sanitation, environment and education. The combined effects of floods and droughts cause losses of at least 1.7% of Malawi’s GDP annually. And due to food shortages and higher domestic prices, the national poverty headcount rate increases by almost 1% each year.

One of the major reasons for floods in Malawi is rainfall characteristics. Rainfall is variable, erratic and rainfall in the highlands often causes floods in the low-lying areas. Also, extensive deforestation increases runoff and the overall flood risk.

But to understand how floods become a “disaster” we need to understand why local communities are so vulnerable in the first place. Floods, similar to other hazards, are often portrayed as “natural disasters” when their impact actually has a large amount to do with social and human vulnerability.

As Phil O'Keefe, Ken Westgate and Ben Wisner – prominent scholars who shaped current academic thinking on the topic – have argued, the impact of disasters like floods is a consequence of social and economic factors. For instance, high poverty levels mean people lack access to land and work and they are often driven to settle in zones that are more exposed to natural hazards.

What this suggests is that the most effective approach to managing the effects of floods is to deal with the underlying causes of vulnerability. This should include addressing particular issues that make certain community groups more vulnerable than others. Because the threat of floods can’t be eliminated, the best strategy is one that improves the overall development of local communities.

In my research I investigated community-based flood-risk strategies, which are widely used in Malawi. My findings showed that although strategies are mostly responsive and focus on relief, more are starting to look at how to mitigate and prepare for floods.

But a number of challenges remain. There’s not enough funding, community participation is limited, while the existing decentralised governance system isn’t effective so project planning, implementation and maintenance isn’t smooth. Projects are also unsustainable, rely heavily on aid and there’s a lack of ownership by the community which undermines the impact.

Vulnerable communities

Malawi is the third poorest country in the world. About half the population lives below the poverty line. Chikwawa and Nsanje, which have been particularly affected by the floods, are the poorest in the country.

Over 80% of Malawians rely on agriculture. Most are smallholder farmers. With their livelihoods reliant on a single rain-fed season they are particularly vulnerable to floods. Recent research shows that smallholder farmers lose 2.67% of their agricultural produce to flooding each year.

High levels of poverty, a lack of access to land and a growing population means people have smaller pieces of land for farming. This has led to settlements in marginalised areas that are prone to flooding.

Another factor contributing to people’s vulnerability is that housing and infrastructure are of poor quality. In addition, there’s a lack of economic diversification, employment opportunities and access to social services. This means that people are limited in how they can prepare for a possible flood and bounce back after it’s happened.

What’s being done

To address the flood disasters the Malawian government signed a comprehensive national disaster risk policy in 2015. But delivery has been mixed.. This is mainly because of a lack of designated funding and a number of challenges in the existing governance approaches.

The government has pushed for resettlement of people living in flood prone areas. But planning is ineffective and giving people land with no other support can expose them to further risks.

Flood risk management is mostly delivered by NGOs who implement community-based approaches like early warning systems, search and rescue training, village contingency planning, and the establishment of group savings schemes.

There have also been attempts to create a state-of-the-art national early warning system, based on the latest computer modelling and satellite products. Its effectiveness hasn’t been evaluated yet.

Despite these efforts the gaps in managing the risk of floods are significant. A network of rain gauges as well as timely weather and climate information are essential components for early warning systems and planning. But both need to be improved. In addition, there’s not enough uptake by local communities of early warning information.

And on top of it all there’s barely any flood protection infrastructure – like robust dikes. What does exist is of poor quality.

One of the biggest problems is that there’s only limited involvement of local communities. This has led to projects not being implemented in all affected areas. And often projects reflect the donor’s agenda rather than needs on the ground.

Way forward

To manage flood risks more effectively Malawi needs to take some crucial steps.

The first is that short-term priorities must be identified and coupled with a comprehensive long-term adaptive plan. This should also take into account the possible effects of climate change. It must provide a fine balance between physical infrastructure and improved forecasting and warning systems, among other strategies. And more comprehensive risk assessments should make use of new technologies – like remote sensing and crowd-sourcing.

This must be accompanied by a well-planned financial agenda. Finally, any proposed solutions must be designed with the involvement of those most affected because they are the custodians of rich local knowledge and can provide valuable insights.

Exposed to a number of extreme hazards which include not only floods, but earthquakes, tsunamis, landslides, hurricanes, and emerging hazards brought on by climate change and urbanization—the country is partnering with University of Hawaiʻi applied research center, Pacific Disaster Center (PDC), to complete a National Disaster Preparedness Baseline Assessment (NDPBA). The NDPBA aims to strengthen disaster resilience, avert catastrophic losses, and reduce human suffering associated with natural disasters in Trinidad and Tobago. It will be performed in collaboration with the country’s Ministry of National Security who co-hosted the initial meeting and assessment workshop on March 20, 2019 in the nation’s capital Port of Spain.

The workshop garnered strong national support and was widely attended by more than 85 key stakeholders representing Trinidad and Tobago’s many diverse ministries and nongovernmental organizations. It included guest participation by U.S. Ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago Joseph Mondello who provided opening remarks alongside keynote speaker Stuart Young, Trinidad and Tobago’s Minister of National Security.

“Stakeholders from local State Agencies responsible for disaster preparedness, disaster mitigation, disaster response and disaster recovery are today participating in a workshop aimed at strengthening disaster risk reduction and disaster management capabilities. Today’s National Disaster Preparedness Baseline Assessment workshop is the first step in a collaborative initiative between the Governments of Trinidad and Tobago and the United States of America and is being facilitated by the Pacific Disaster Centre (PDC),” said Minister Young of the NDPBA initiative. Minister Young reminded participants of the importance of pre-planning for disasters and emergency situations as well as maintaining open lines of communication in order to maximize reach. He reiterated that first responders have the full support of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago and expressed his appreciation to the U.S. Government for their continued support in capacity-building initiatives like the NDPBA. The Minister also recognized the facilitators from the PDC for sharing their expertise in the area of disaster management.

Also delivering remarks was Ambassador of the United States of America to Trinidad and Tobago Joseph N. Mondello. The Ambassador thanked the Government of Trinidad and Tobago for their support in organizing the workshop and indicated that he looked forward to further collaboration on building national resilience.

“As a scientific Center for disaster prevention that grew out of Hawaiʻi’s extreme hazard exposure, vulnerabilities, and geographic isolation, we at PDC share similarities in challenges and feel a camaraderie with Trinidad and Tobago,” said Tim Manning, PDC’s Director of Washington D.C. Operations. He said the team is already impressed with the initiatives underway in Trinidad and Tobago and looks forward to future knowledge exchanges during the partnership. “Throughout this in-depth assessment, as we look closely at capacities within Trinidad and Tobago’s administrative regions and municipalities, we will be continuously integrating data, and sharing information and findings. This helps our partners make use of the information immediately and it helps validate our work early and often to ensure the best possible results and outcomes.”","Mon, 25 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.pdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Trinidad_Tobago_City.jpg,"['trinidad', 'participation', 'disaster', 'workshop', 'tobagos', 'pdc', 'ndpba', 'risk', 'reduction', 'strong', 'receives', 'garners', 'support', 'tobago', 'preparedness', 'initiative', 'national']",

In Mozambique, the death toll has risen to 446. In Zimbabwe and Malawi, the number of people who died is up to 259 and 56.

Authorities and aid agencies fear more deaths amid a high risk of cholera and other water-borne diseases spreading through devastated areas.

""It is inevitable that cases of cholera and malaria will arise,"" said Mozambique's Land Minister Celso Correia on Sunday. ""In many areas we are already fighting with malaria cases.""

The flooding has created a 125-kilometer (78-mile) wide lake, devastating an area previously populated by hundreds of thousands of people.

Speaking alongside Correia at a briefing in Beira, on the coast 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) north of Maputo, Sebastian Rhodes Stampa of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned that the outbreak of disease in inaccessible areas could be ""really problematic.""

Disaster similar to Yemen and Syria

The World Food Programme said that the humanitarian disaster unfolding in Mozambique is on a par with the situation in Yemen and Syria.

Ongoing rainfall and damage to major roads has made reaching those who were in the path of the cyclone ten days ago challenging. The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said the situation was worse than they had imagined and that humanitarian needs ""will tragically only deepen in the coming weeks.""

Aid agencies are used to delivering aid by land but have been forced to use helicopters. However, there are only a few available — only India's and South Africa's military have provided them for search and rescue operations.

Efforts have been made to re-open the main access road to Beira, which saw the brunt of the storm when it made landfall.

Many people who lost their homes are living in shelters around Beira. Others are still sheltering in what remains of their villages, unsure of where to go. Father Pedro held a mass at the Ponta Gea Catholic Cathedral in Beira on Saturday night. He said: ""The people don't know what to do because they lost their houses, they have no food, they don't know where to sleep."" Up to 110,000 people are staying in shelters.

International aid

Germany has provided €1 million ($1.13 million) in emergency aid and is redirecting some of the €4.3 million already earmarked for humanitarian assistance in Southern Africa for 2019 to be used for the most urgent humanitarian needs. It is also promoting projects run by the German Red Cross.

China's Ministry of Emergency Management said on Sunday it had deployed a 65-strong foreign aid team with 20 metric tons of emergency aid supplies. A similar amount is being sent from the UK, the defense secretary said on Sunday. The UK has already provided €25 million in aid and is helping with deliveries inside Mozambique.

The Canadian government is to provide initial funding of up to $3.5 million in emergency assistance and donate relief supplies, including tarpaulins, shelter kits, mosquito nets and blankets. Other contributions have come from Japan, Belgium and Morocco.

At that time, he was a 25-year-old student at Gajah Mada University and a member of Indonesian Students Solidarity for Democracy (SMID), a student organization that actively campaigned for democracy.

One afternoon, Mugiyanto went home to the apartment he shared with other activists.

“We thought the place was safe, but on March 13, I discovered no one was home and our laptop was gone,” he told VOA.

Not long after, there were people knocking on his door. He felt he did not have any choice and opened the door.

About 10 people, two of them wearing military uniforms, arrested him.

“All I could think about was ‘I’m dead,’” he said.

Under Indonesian President Suharto’s 31-year rule, many activists were allegedly kidnapped in an attempt to silence them. Mugiyanto and others who survived believe Prabowo Subianto, Suharto’s former son-in-law, who is running in the presidential race against the incumbent Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, was involved in the kidnappings.

?General commander of Indonesian Special Force

Mugiyanto was taken to an undisclosed area blindfolded where he said he was tortured and interrogated for two days.

“Every time I didn’t give a satisfactory answer they would beat me up,” he said.

He managed to get a glimpse of his captors’ uniforms when his blindfold was removed to take his photo. That’s when he saw the Indonesian Army Special Force logo. Mugiyanto is adamant that Subianto was involved because he was the general commander of the special force in 1998. Along with other survivors and families of missing persons, he publicly declared at a press conference his support for incumbent Jokowi.

“But it’s not just that. There were investigations conducted by different agencies, including the National Commission for Human Rights, the Military Honor Council. ... Third evidence was when the Honor Council decided to terminate him from the military service,” he explained.

Amnesty International reported that Subianto was dismissed from the Indonesian military in 1998 for his role in the disappearance of political activists.

Subianto has also been denied visas to visit the United States, telling Reuters in 2012 that the denials were based on allegations he had instigated riots that killed hundreds after Suharto’s ouster. He denies wrongdoing.

The spokesperson of Subianto’s campaign team, Andre Rosiade, says the issue of past human rights violations is being politicized for the presidential election. Rosiade says there was no proof that Subianto was involved in the kidnapping and he was never put on trial or indicted.

Human rights issue

Hendri Satrio, a political analyst and the founder of public opinion polling agency KedaiKOPI, says the issue of human rights will not put a damper on Subianto’s electability. He says the problems that are being considered in the minds of Indonesian voters are the economy and legal issues.

“Human rights issue is crucial and we must pay attention to it. But for the majority of Indonesians it is not an indicator whether to vote for a leader or not,” he told VOA.

Satrio adds that the issue of past human rights violation should be over since the General Election Commission approved Subianto’s candidacy.

“The activists and families of victims should’ve raised the issue long before Prabowo became a presidential candidate,” he said.

Meanwhile, Miftah N. Sabri from Subianto’s campaign team believes this issue was brought up because Jokowi’s campaign team is not ready to sell the current president’s achievement.

“It’s like a broken record, they keep bringing it up. It doesn’t affect us,” Sabri said.

According to the latest survey by the Indonesian Newspaper Kompas, the electability of Prabowo Subianto and his running mate Sandiaga Uno increased by 4.7 percent within six months to 37.4 percent. Jokowi and Ma’ruf Amin, however, saw their electability decreased by 3.4 percent to 49.2 percent.

Past atrocities remain unsolved

Rosiade says those who were affected by the incident in 1998 should confront President Jokowi because he had promised in the 2014 election that he would solve past human rights violations.

“They should ask what he has done in four years,” he added.

Mugiyanto says for him, the choice is easy: “I don’t want to vote for someone who has committed a crime and I think Jokowi still has the good intention to solve human rights cases that happened in the past,” he said.

“But if Prabowo wins, that would delegitimize all the efforts and sacrifice by the pro-democracy movement in Indonesia that finally managed to overthrow the New Order in 1998,” Mugiyanto said.","Sun, 24 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/8AB462D9-209D-46F1-92BF-E033605D3A3A.jpg,"['indonesia', 'indonesian', 'heats', 'rights', 'issue', 'presidential', 'election', 'military', 'subianto', 'human', 'race', 'prabowo']",

The decision comes in the midst of historic flooding that has displaced thousands of people and destroyed homes, farms, and infrastructure across parts of the U.S. Midwest.

The National Flood Insurance Program is run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and covers more than 5 million properties across the United States, both those in coastal and inland flood zones. A string of costly natural disasters and worsening flooding caused by sea level rise has saddled the program with debt, topping $30 billion in 2017, Bloomberg News reported.

“This is badly needed,” Shana Udvardy, a climate resilience analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said of the overhaul. She called the shift “a huge step in the right direction, so we can let communities, particularly those communities that have been repetitively flooded, know what their actual risk is.”

To date, the program has largely set policy premiums based on whether a home is in the 100-year flood zone; it doesn’t account for a home’s value or its proximity to a body of water. In addition, FEMA’s flood maps have long been criticized as being out of date, not accurately reflecting flood risks in an era of climate change. FEMA said its overhaul will address these issues.

“What we’re going to do is change an insurance-rating structure that hasn’t fundamentally been changed since the 1970s,” David Maurstad, FEMA’s deputy associate administrator for insurance and mitigation, told The Wall Street Journal. “We’re going to consider more flood risk than we currently do now.”

FEMA plans to announce its new rates in April 2020, with them taking effect October 1. Because Congress restricts how much FEMA can increase policy rates, the agency plans to phase in changes over the next several years, Maurstad said.

Private insurers, which today provide just 5 percent of residential flood insurance policies nationwide, are also returning to the market, E&E News reported. New technology and mapping is allowing these companies to create detailed assessments of properties’ flood risks. “We’re all trying to accomplish more coverage,” Christopher Heidrick, chairman of the flood insurance task force of the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, said. “There’s no question that recovery is much faster on a structure that’s insured than on a structure that’s not insured.”","Tue, 19 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://e360.yale.edu/assets/img/favicons/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png,"['announced', 'flood', 'risks', 'federal', 'structure', 'thats', 'plans', 'risk', 'fema', 'program', 'policy', 'insurance', 'overhaul', 'rise']", 
42,42,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Schoolchildren in Assam produce their agenda for the national elections - Mongabay-India,https://india.mongabay.com/2019/03/school-children-in-assam-produce-their-agenda-for-the-national-elections/,"About 500 girls from Assam, aged 14 to 19, have produced a ‘Children’s Agenda’ for the 2019 national elections, focusing on health, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene and education and protection of children.

The group has approached politicians to include concerns such as flood-resilient infrastructure in election manifestos for the 2019 general elections.

The children have questioned whether the disaster-prone areas have been given the priority they deserve. They also recommend cutting back on fertilisers.

Children across the world have realised it’s now or never.

As youth worldwide skip schools today in protest to demand action on climate change, a group of girls in the flood-prone Indian state of Assam has approached politicians to include concerns such as flood-resilient infrastructure in election manifestos for the 2019 general elections.

Over 500 children of the age group 14 to 19 years were consulted to work out a ‘ Children’s Agenda ’ focusing on health, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene and education and protection of children.

The agenda was prepared under the guidance of UNICEF, Assam and the Adolescent and Children Rights Network, Assam (ACRNA) , a forum of 21 NGOs working for children in the state where raging floods affect millions of people in the state from June to September.

“The children voiced their request for flood-resilient infrastructure, particularly schools. They said beyond erosion, the main issue was flooding because they were not in a position to attend schools… the schools were not accessible,” Chiranjib Kakoty of ACRNA told Mongabay-India.

Hundreds of schools across the state remain submerged and hundreds of others across the state are turned into relief camps hindering education during the flood season.

The agenda, processed over a year and a half, conveyed the challenge of availing safe drinking water during the flood season and disasters as also proper toilets during the disaster. A group of teenage girls discussed their concerns to five political parties including the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Congress and the Asom Gana Parishad.

“The idea of having some residential facility in the season because what happens is sometimes the distance between the place of residence and the school is so great that even if you have resilient infrastructure if you can’t access them, it has no meaning at all for them,” said Kakoty.

This is because floods disrupt the annual education calendar and this has ramifications for the protection of children.

“Once you drop out of school the spiralling down begins. It could be child labour, it could be child marriage and sometimes it could also be child trafficking,” Kakoty said.

The discontinuity of schooling of children also results in poor learning outcome of schoolchildren, according to Saswati Paik, a faculty at Azim Premji University in Bengaluru.

Paik said: “Such issues are rarely recognised as disaster-related issues at the system level, rather these are interpreted with the lens of economic under privilege, lack of social awareness, etc which are actually consequences of disasters, but not the actual causes of school-related issues in disaster-prone areas.”

Batting for gathering data on schools and students in disaster prone areas, Paik pointed out managing safety and natural hazards at the school level are not new concepts.

“Many initiatives have been taken by the countries which have experienced and considered these issues very seriously. India must think of a large-scale mechanism to address these issues at the systemic level,” she added.

For example, she said one way could be to make available digitised maps and satellite imageries with the education officers at the block and district levels that may help to identify the schools and analyse probable risk factors associated with those schools.

The children’s query also deals with the reach of services and developmental indicators in a disaster-prone area.

“They have questioned whether the disaster-prone areas have been given the priority they deserve,” said Kakoty.

The Assam State Disaster Management Authority has identified the role of education department to “maintain and ensure school facilities across the state that can stand safe from known hazard risks, so that they continue to function in a post-disaster environment.” And the public health engineering department is responsible for “providing safe drinking water to all the schools located in rural areas.”

From 1953 to 2017 , floods have claimed a total of 3093 human lives while 171 million were affected. In 50 years, 13 major flood events battered the state.

It is a global problem

In the southern Indian state of Kerala, at least 650 schools were damaged by the 2018 floods.

The 2011 floods in Thailand resulted in damage to 2,198 schools, 223 non-formal education institutes, 96 private schools, 126 vocational institutes and nine higher education institutes.

Disaster management expert Indrajit Pal points out that seasonal occurrences of floods in the south and southeast Asian cities regularly affect schools.

Pal said it is “unfortunate” that though 85 percent of the geographical area in India is vulnerable to one or multiple natural disasters, the number of schools located in each of these disaster-prone areas, and the number of children silently getting excluded from schools every year in these areas are not recorded systematically.

“Dropout from primary and secondary schools badly impact employability, earning sources and resources of people, poor health, malnutrition and malpractices in society,” said Pal, a professor at Thailand’s Asian Institute of Technology.

“Due to the rapid urbanisation and growth of megacities in the region over the coming decades, food-related issues are likely to multiply in the context of climate change and extreme weather events,” Pal told Mongabay-India.

Despite the progress in Disaster Risk Reduction Approach and disaster management over the last decade, systematic approaches to incorporating effective practices and policies into the education sector are still lacking in the region, he added.

Chiranjib Kakoty hoped the children’s appeal would move politicians to look at the issues from the perspective of child welfare.

“The issues listed are relevant to the children. We are optimistic that their voices will resonate with leaders,” Kakoty added.

The six key messages children shared are that:

They want a sense of normalcy restored as soon as possible- routines that fill the day and make them feel positive. This means proper school hours and lessons (albeit it in temporary locations), provision of play and ‘hanging out’ space, and structured activities (younger children) or structured opportunities to help others and contribute to the recovery efforts.

They feel grateful to have survived and described stronger empathy, altruism and thoughtfulness toward others than before the earthquake.

They feel fearful and emotional at times but there seems to be limited understanding and awareness about appropriate recovery activities for children.

They need assurances that lessons are learned about the location and construction materials used in housing and facilities in the future.

They are eating less quantity and less diversity of food.

Adolescents receive less relief and support than primary-age children

Why listen to children?

Children’s experience of disasters differs from adults. They have priorities and needs that only they can accurately articulate. They have a right to participation2 . In order to respond better to their needs we must find ways to help them share their experiences, their feelings and their ideas for improvements.

Where did we go?

We selected two locations in each of three affected districts (Palu, Donggala and Sigi) based on secondary data which seeks to identify the more affected and disadvantaged areas. We intentionally selected both rural and urban locations and those on the coast and inland.

With whom did we interact?

A total of 244 children participated. 150 were primary-school age children (54% girls, 46% boys) and 94 secondaryschool age adolescents (52% girls 48% boys). We also had opportunistic interactions with pregnant women and caregivers of small children to include their perspectives.

How we listened to them?

Our key principle was to put children at ease. So we emphasised playing with younger children and hanging out with adolescents in spaces they felt most comfortable in. This enabled us to simply chat, to get to know them and build trust. We started by asking small groups of friends to show us around each community and point out places that had changed and begin to think about how they felt about these changes.

Gradually, as trust was built, we introduced participatory activities to engage and explore issues further, always doing these in places where they felt uninhibited, safe and relaxed. The participatory activities included drawings of before and after the earthquake (younger children), photojournalism (adolescents), mapping emotions (all), animating puppets (younger children) or magazine cutouts (older children), acting out ‘being the boss’ and prioritizing needs. We were intentionally flexible about each activity and we facilitated many short interactions over several days to accommodate children’s daily activities and recognizing short attention spans. Engaging children in hands-on activities created enthusiasm to participate, put them in the driving seat and moved away from conventional question- answer formats.

What children say are key changes they experience

1. Need for restoration of normalcy

Given that some time had elapsed between the earthquake and this study, both younger children and adolescents were keen to share that ‘things are starting to feel normal again’ and that they are feeling better because of this. The loss of normalcy and the need to restore it as soon as possible was the most significant key change.

The most important element of feeling normal again is attending school. School is primarily a place to meet friends3 . Resumption of school provides an opportunity to interact with friends, get out of the home and return to some kind of routine. In some locations, particularly in Palu, children told us that quite a few of their friends have yet to return to school and that they are eager to see these friends again and feel it would be good for them to resume a routine.

Most children are attending school in temporary tents (provided through relief or community constructed structures) with abbreviated hours and have yet to return to their normal lessons.

Many say these tents are hot and crowded and teachers are often absent. Teaching resources are very limited. But this matters less than getting up each morning, preparing for school, spending hours together with friends and not being idle at home.

‘We miss our regular school schedule’

(primary-age children, Donggala Scenic)

Children across locations were sad about the loss of their favorite play and hang out spaces. Like school, these places provided opportunities to get out of the home and interact with friends.

In Donggala Scenic, an area formerly known as a place for leisure activities on the beach, younger children described how they had lost almost all of their favorite play areas including a small dock, their football field on the beach, the area of ketapang trees, and the community library. Only their volleyball field, located on higher ground, remains. The problem in some locations is not just earthquake and tsunami damage but occupation of former football fields and play areas by relief camps and temporary housing.

Adolescent boys have been able to establish new ‘hang out’ areas more easily than girls or younger children because of the greater freedom given to them to go around/outside of the community and their access to motorbikes. In some cases, adolescent girls have found that their parents have also become more protective and restrictive since displacement to camps or temporary accommodation. These issues are affecting girls’ opportunities and space to socialize.

Children shared that the sense of normalcy is also restored through engaging in household chores. This, like school, provides routine but also provides something to do so that their time is occupied and they feel less bored. Adolescents repeatedly shared not having enough to do (especially as school time is short and study limited). For example, adolescent girls in Sigi Upper felt they were, ‘just doing the same things over and over again.’ In their search for things to do, adolescent girls in Palu Industrial said they had joined a reproductive health information session which was actually targeted for mothers.

With school-related work and activities still limited, in many locations religious activities have filled part of this void for both younger children and adolescents. For example, children said they like to attend activities at the mosque or church (especially boys in Palu Industrial and Sigi Upper). This is providing something to do and structure to the day and many children shared that they felt they wanted to pray more than before the earthquake (especially girls in Palu City, Palu Industrial, and Donggala Scenic). Some described these activities as helping them feel better or fulfilling a need to become a better person after surviving the disaster.

2. Increased feelings of altruism

Another key change children shared relates to how they see relationships. Children in all locations shared how they had become more aware of others since the earthquake, especially others’ needs and how they were coping with their situations. They recognized that their parents were facing hardships, describing their busyness and preoccupation around their homes including stress and a tendency to get angry more easily. Some children shared their parent’s anxieties that they had not been able to return to their former livelihood routines yet like fishing or cultivation. Other children were concerned specifically about difficulties faced due to loss of income earning opportunities. Children and adolescents talked about purposely giving their parents space and seeking out their friends when their parents are getting angry or being ‘grumpy’. Children also noted that some support for their parents is absent. For example , children in the Donggala locations said that healthcare services were now more limited such as in Donggala Rocky where the midwife has not returned yet.

Children’s enhanced awareness of others also extended to their friends. The change they described is one of greater appreciation of friendships and the need to nurture these friendships. Playing and hanging out together makes them feel better. For example, adolescent girls (Palu Industrial) shared that they have realized they used to spend a lot of time watching TV instead of being with their friends but now see the latter makes them feel happier. They appreciate friendship more as described by younger children (Donggala Scenic) who shared that they do not get as angry with their friends as they did before the earthquake and have realized that ‘we need to take care of each other.’ Here they also talked about rebuilding their homes along the main village road where friends already are and not ‘too far and (where) we would be lonely.’

3. Eating less and less variety

Related to this increased awareness, children across locations talked about how they are eating less food and adolescents in particular felt they could help their parents by limiting their food intake. Children also talked about eating less because they were tired of the limited variety of food available and many shared how they were sick of eating instant noodles.

Breastfeeding mothers in the Sigi locations shared that although they supplemented breastfeeding with formula milk before the earthquake they do so with more frequency now since they are getting free formula milk.

4. Feeling fearful and emotional

While many children shared that they often feel happy being able to play with friends and having some of their routine back to normal, some shared that is hard to be completely happy again with the uncertainty of their situation. Their main worries were about where they are going to live, when their parents will be able to earn again and some adolescents worried if they would be able to catch up in school. Many noted ‘fast and frequent changes’ in their emotions, where they might spend the day happily hanging around with their friends only to suddenly feel sad before going to sleep. Children, particularly adolescents, also talked about feeling ‘miserable’ and ‘hopeless’ because their parents got angry more easily.

Some shared that they felt pressured to ‘move on’. For example, adolescent girls in Sigi Lower said they never tell their teachers about their feelings because ‘our teachers just tell us “don’t be sad”.’ In Palu City, some adolescents have internalized this and exhort their own friends to ‘move on’, particularly those who have not yet returned to school.

Both younger children and adolescents shared that they still frequently feel scared about the possibility of another earthquake, tsunami and flash floods. These worries are exacerbated by the rumours and hoaxes that are spread especially through social media, particularly in the Palu locations. These include fake earthquake warnings and other predictions. Even though many have realized these are hoaxes, adolescents shared that they cannot reassure their parents who still panic and ask the family to pack up and leave.","Wed, 20 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1263898-ListeningtoChildren_Palu_FinalReport_web.png?itok=sTyL9vr9,"['school', 'indonesia', 'listening', 'earthquake', 'routine', 'central', 'activities', 'tsunami', 'enid', 'friends', 'adolescents', 'children', 'sulawesi', 'feel', 'shared', 'parents', 'locations', 'younger', 'lets']",

To quit or not to quit? This was the question that haunted Rany Hartono, 25, as she faced a personal crisis with social media in 2017.

As an avid social media user who was finishing her undergraduate thesis, Rany was struck with growing anxiety as her friend’s graduation pictures flooded her Instagram feed.

In the following months, Rany ebbed back and forth in her attempts to withdraw from social media, which prompted her to cut down on her social engagements for as long as three months.

“[I kept coming back] because I needed to know what events were happening around me,” Rany said. “I also felt the need to share my thoughts and what I was experiencing.”

Rany’s quandary is likely typical of many millennials who suffer from a fear of missing out (FOMO).

The community is one of 13 dotted around Makassar, all of which are part of the five-year Revitalising Informal Settlements and their Environments (RISE) project funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Asian Development Bank, and led by the Monash Sustainable Development Institute. A dozen settlements in Suva, Fiji, are also involved.

An interdisciplinary program bringing together five Monash faculties and expert partners from around the world, RISE takes a localised, “water-sensitive” approach to deliver lasting environmental and health improvements. Linked to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal to “ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”, the aim is for the communities to be able to reduce contamination and improve their living conditions through “green” infrastructure.

The RISE Indonesia team comprises “built”, “assessment” and “field” units, each working closely with the communities; without the latters’ trust and cooperation, the project wouldn’t be viable.

“We’ve been very active in getting support from the community from the start,” says Jane Wardani, who was until recently the RISE Indonesia coordinator. “It’s really important that the communities are involved, and not only give their permission, but they’re really engaged and they’re able to give their input both for the ‘built’ part and the assessment part.

“For the built part, definitely, because they know best what their main water and sanitation problems are. So, they tell us both their problems and what they think would be good solutions,” she says. “We’re not here to tell them what the solutions are; they play a really important role in customising the solutions to their needs. And in the long term, in terms of operational and maintenance of the built intervention, it’s very important the communities are involved as well.”

Biology's part

Biological data also plays a significant role in the project.

“We’ll be collecting samples from the community, including human and environmental samples, to see if the water-sensitive cities approach will improve human and environmental health,” Ms Wardani says.

And, she adds, it’s all about big-picture thinking.

“The water-sensitive cities approach is looking at water in an integrated fashion. So, we just don’t look at clean water and sanitation; we also look at flooding and how waste water is processed or treated.

Watch: Water-sensitive revitalisation in informal urban settlements

“Because we see water problems as interrelated, we try to find solutions that benefit multiple water objectives. So, for example, if a community has problems with flooding, we look at installing rainwater harvesting tanks in each household that might alleviate some of the housing problems, but also provide additional security of water supply in the community,” she says.

Improving gut health

A specific aim is to improve intestinal health among children, who are particularly vulnerable in such difficult conditions.

“We’re looking at the impact of living in a contaminated environment on the digestive system, especially for children, because they’re putting things in their mouths as part of their growth and exploration,” says Ms Wardani. “So, we’re trying to see whether cleaning up the environment will have an impact on their development, especially as related to their digestive system.”

Even for the RISE workers, the communities’ living conditions can be confronting. For example, in some dwellings, drinking water sources and toilets are less than a metre apart.

“It’s been eye-opening for me, and I think for the research team in Melbourne as well, in terms of understanding the sources of water these communities have to rely on, whether it be shallow wells that are contaminated due to insufficient sanitation practices, with wastewater from toilets that might be leaching into the ground water and contaminating clean water sources that the community’s relying on.”

Self-sufficiency vital

Sustainability is key to the project’s success. Ultimately, if the communities can’t remain self-sufficient after the five-year project, the purpose is defeated. That’s why, as well as buildings and water tanks, the surrounding environment is being taken into account through the installation of artificial wetlands.

“[These wetlands] may be sub-surface or surface wetlands that help to treat waste water through natural processes, removing bacteria and nutrients before the waste water is discharged into the drainage or the rest of the environment,” explains Ms Wardani. “We’re trying to prevent a situation where contaminated water is taken away from the community, but floodwaters bring it back in the future and it gets into their houses.”

It’s hoped that this stage of the project, which ends in 2022, will pave the way for further expansion regionally, and globally.

49,49,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Investors' appetites whetted by alternative proteins - Food - Jakarta Post,https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2019/03/14/investors-appetites-whetted-by-alternative-proteins.html,"Cell-cultured meat, plant-based foie gras, algae milk and seaweed caviar are just some of the increasingly sophisticated alternative protein options flooding the market -- and whetting investors' appetites.

Last year alone, dozens of companies were launched, and many are attracting big investors, according to the burgeoning industry's pioneers.

""For every company that's looking for money, there are two or three investors. I've never seen that in Silicon Valley,"" said Olivia Fox Cabane, founder of the Kind Earth startup and chair of the International Alliance for Alternative Protein.

Fox Cabane says she needs to update her list every other week, and likens the dynamism of the alternative protein market to the buzz around social networks when they began to monopolize attention.

Beyond California, the early innovators are in the Netherlands, the birthplace of meat and other animal product alternatives, and in Israel.

Consumer demand is driving market interest in meat alternatives, according to participants in this week's South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas, which sees itself at the forefront of new trends.

New technology has refined alternative protein products for a broader public, according to Dan Altschuler Malek, a venture partner in the investing group New Crop Capital.

""Vegan food has been around for decades, since the late 60s, early 70s. At first, it was for ethical consumers who were willing to sacrifice,"" said Altschuler Malek.

""We had to wait for the 90s for it to become more palatable. But now it's a third generation with new technologies and the consumer does not have to sacrifice taste any more: people are just enjoying it because it's good, not because it's plant based.""

For investors, taste has been the biggest factor in deciding whether to support a product. Price, says Altschuler Malek, comes second.

Mainstream in five years?

To make sure they don't get left by the wayside, most of the major agribusiness groups have started investing in new proteins.

Even Tyson Foods -- the second largest meat producer in the United States and the world's biggest exporter of American beef -- has joined the fray.

Impossible Foods is among several firms including California rival Beyond Meat developing plant-based or lab-grown meat substitutes that claim to offer products equal to or better than animal protect.

The company uses wheat protein, potato protein and coconut oil, and its ""special ingredient"" called heme which has elements of the hemoglobin in animal protein but is developed from soy.

There is much progress still to be made, including developing the logistics to offer these products on a large scale and providing substitutes to other commonly purchased meat products.

Altschuler Malek, for example, would like to be able to sell vegetarian ""pork chops"".

He says a new tomato-based substitute for red tuna meat has the same texture and taste as the ""real thing"" used in Japanese sushi.

He believes that the new foods will no longer be seen as alternatives in five years but the norm, found ""in every fridge"".

Most meat alternatives are primarily made with soy, peas, chickpeas and wheat gluten, but algae and mushrooms are also showing promise.

Insects, although favored by some startups, weren't a hit with investors in Austin.

In addition to problems of health regulations, it would be quite a leap for the general consumer population to acquire a taste for anything with six legs.

Insect-based protein ""might be more acceptable in some parts of the world, but I don't think the average Western consumer will be going en masse to buy that kind of product,"" said Andrew Ive, managing director Big Idea Ventures.","Thu, 14 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2019/01/09/2019_01_09_62615_1547016686._large.jpg,"['investors', 'product', 'malek', 'alternative', 'products', 'whetted', 'proteins', 'meat', 'protein', 'taste', 'appetites', 'alternatives', 'market']",

In the last few days, some of the worst flooding ever recorded — triggered by cyclone Idai — has devastated southeast Africa. Storm surge floods up to six meters (about 20 feet) deep have destroyed nearly 90 percent of Mozambique, as well as neighboring Zimbabwe and Malawi, decimating almost all water and power infrastructure.

Between extreme floods and drought, global warming is disrupting the planet's water cycle.

Worldwide flooding

Across the Atlantic, flooding in the US state of Nebraska has been so bad an entire city was walled off from the outside world. In southeast Asia, more than 80 people have been killed in flash floods brought on by torrential rain in the Papua Province of Indonesia. Some areas of the province recorded almost 200 mm (7.8 inches) of rain in 24 hours.

A hotter global climate — in which a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture — is causing stronger, more frequent rainfall. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change outlined in their 2018 report, it's likely that anthropogenic influences have affected the global water cycle since 1960.

Heavy rainfall and floods are a natural part of the world's weather cycle, but climate change is exacerbating them.

Drought, heat and fire

On the other end of the spectrum of extremes, vital water sources — like lakes, rivers and wetlands — are drying up. For places like Iraq, Australia and China, drought, heat and fire are becoming the new normal.

In China, 28,000 rivers and waterways have dried up over the past 25 years. The country's Yellow River — the second-longest in Asia — is now a mere tenth of what it once was in the 1940s. In late 2018, former Chinese premier Wen Jiabao said the nation's acute water crisis was a threat to its very survival.

Parts of Australia's Murray-Darling Basin, one of the country's biggest water networks, have experienced huge drops in flows in recent years. Extended drought, prompted by intense heatwaves, in part led to the death of one million fish in the basin over a two-week period in January 2019.

In the Middle East, the Mesopotamian marshlands in southern Iraq, once the largest wetland ecosystem in Western Eurasia, are at risk of disappearing after years of drought.

While the links between some weather extremes and climate change are more complicated than others, Jascha Lehmann from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research says the line drawn between floods, drought and global warming is clear.

""There is a lot of evidence pointing to the fact that climate change means we have more weather extremes globally, and this is especially true for heat extremes, for heavy rainfall events and for droughts,"" he told DW.

Pegged to gain an extra 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100 if emissions aren't reduced, the world's climate may yet see the worst of such extremes.

The secret is in the soil

One important impact of temperature rise is greater evaporation rates and plant transpiration, which leads to drier soils. When rainfall does occur, these dry soils absorb more of it.

This, according to Ashish Sharma, professor from the school of civil and environmental engineering at the University of New South Wales, is a crucial aspect of climate change's impact on the water cycle.

A study Sharma co-authored on the topic found that where soils were once moist before heavy rainfall and storms — allowing excess rainfall to runoff into lakes and rivers — they are now so dry they absorb most of the water.

This means, in many parts of the world, increased rainfall is contributing less to ""blue water"" that flows through lakes, rivers and dams and is extracted for human use, and more to ""green water,"" which is soaked up by the landscape.

""What's happening is the first significant chunk of the rainfall has to be used up to wet the soil before the overland flow can occur and before the big flood can form,"" Sharma told DW.

This is more so the case with ""moderate"" floods that flow into dams, the professor said, rather than extreme floods, which tend to lead to more rapid movement of the water from the atmosphere back into the oceans — preventing it from being stored and used.

""It's these moderate floods that supply water to our dams and it's the dams that basically give us water for our irrigation systems for our communities,"" Sharma said. The problem, Sharma surmised, ""is the temperature rise.""

An entire state in Australia was declared in drought for the second half of 2018

Water wars

Less water in our rivers, lakes and dams means less water for drinking, sanitation, food production, energy, and many other vital uses. It can also fuel conflict, and drive people from their homelands.

Age-old tribes like the Marsh Arabs in Iraq are being deprived of their livelihoods on the marshlands. The worst drought in Syria's history, from 2007 to 2010, has been credited as triggering political unrest and instability in the region, leading to a surge of refugees into Europe.

As Friederike Otto, associate professor at the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University outlines — and as climate change is continually showing — it is the world's poorest and most marginalized that disproportionately suffer.

""It's important in these debates not to forget just who and what is in harm's way, about vulnerability and exposure, by blaming [all extreme weather events] on climate change,"" she told DW.

""We shouldn't assume that just because it's 'climate change' that we can't do anything.

54,54,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Why flood insurance needs an overhaul: 6 questions answered - The Conversation US,https://theconversation.com/why-flood-insurance-needs-an-overhaul-6-questions-answered-114053,"Editor’s note: The Trump administration plans to significantly revamp the pricing of flood insurance. While some homeowners would see their premiums rise, others would benefit from lower rates. We asked an insurance expert to explain what the government program currently works and why it’s in dire need of fixing.

1. What is flood insurance?

Homeowners’ insurance does not cover damage to a home caused by flooding. A homeowner must have a separate policy to cover flood-related losses, defined as water traveling along or under the ground.

Most such policies are underwritten by the National Flood Insurance Program, which is part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The program was established in 1968 to address the lack of availability of flood insurance in the private market and reduce demand for federal disaster assistance. It also contains provisions intended to reduce flood risk.

The National Flood Insurance Program’s activities are funded largely by the premiums and fees paid by its policyholders, supplemented by a little from the federal budget to help pay for flood risk mapping. Because the program serves the public interest by promoting “sound land use” and minimizing exposure of property to flood losses, some believe that more of its funding for flood risk management should be borne by taxpayers.

Homeowners can purchase a federal flood policy directly from the program or through a private insurer. Separately, some private insurers sell their own flood policies on a limited basis for properties that are overcharged by the government’s program.

2. How many American homeowners have flood insurance?

It is difficult to determine exactly how many homeowners have flood insurance.

The National Flood Insurance Program had just over 5 million policies in force as of this January. Of these policies, approximately 69 percent were on single-family homes and 20 percent on condo units. There is no source on how many private flood policies are in force, but my sense is that that they represent only about 15 percent of all policies sold nationally.

In recent years, the number of such policies has been dropping across the country over concerns about the cost and because people underestimate the risk of flooding. In Nebraska, the hardest hit by recent record flooding in the Midwest, there are fewer than 10,000 policies for a state with almost 2 million residents. The damage is expected to exceed US$1 billion.

Even hurricane-prone areas, such as those hit by Harvey in 2017, are woefully underinsured. In Harris County, which includes Houston, for example, experts estimated before Harvey that only about 15 percent of homeowners were insured for floods – though the percentage should be higher in areas near coastlines.

Real estate data company CoreLogic estimated that approximately 75 percent of flood losses from Harvey were uninsured, a figure that totaled about 80 percent for Hurricane Irma.

3. Why do people at great risk of flooding forgo insurance?

A number of factors affect a homeowner’s decision to buy flood insurance – or not.

People who perceive that their exposure to floods is high are more likely to buy it, all other things equal. While a mandatory purchase requirement is intended to force owners of mortgaged homes in areas at high risk of flooding to buy insurance, it’s estimated that only about half of them do.

One reason might be that 43 percent of homeowners incorrectly believe that their homeowners’ insurance covers them for flood losses.

Other factors also come into play, such as a lack of information, the difficulty of calculating flood risk and the expectation that the government will provide disaster assistance that will fully cover a homeowner’s uninsured flood losses – which is in fact rarely the case.

4. What does flood insurance cover?

With a National Flood Insurance Program policy, a homeowner can purchase coverage on a dwelling up to $250,000 and the contents of a home up to $100,000. It does not cover costs associated with “loss of use” of a home.

These limits have been in effect since 1994 and are no longer high enough to account for the increase in the replacement cost of homes and the actual cash value of their contents. As a result, some homeowners buy additional flood protection from private insurers to make up any shortfall.

5. Why is the National Flood Insurance Program underwater?

The National Flood Insurance Program has faced considerable criticism over its underwriting and pricing of policies, which have resulted in a substantial debt. Essentially, its premiums are not high enough to cover how much it pays out on claims and its other costs.

Part of the problem is that about 20 percent of the properties the program insures pay a subsidized rate. But many other National Flood Insurance Program policyholders are also paying premiums substantially less than what it costs to insure them based largely on whether a home is inside or outside of the 100-year floodplain.

To show how much single storms can cost, the National Flood Insurance Program paid out $8.7 billion to cover Harvey-related flood losses, $16.3 billion for Katrina and $8.8 billion for Sandy.

These inadequate rates also exacerbate the moral hazard created by flood insurance. People are more likely to buy, build or rebuild homes in flood-prone areas and have diminished incentives to invest in flood risk mitigation, such as by elevating their home, if they can buy insurance at below-cost rates.

Although Congress forgave $16 billion in debt in 2017, the National Flood Insurance Program still owed $21 billion to the U.S. Treasury as of September.

6. What can be done to fix the program?

Legislative efforts to reform the National Flood Insurance Program to put it on firmer fiscal footing have produced mixed results.

The Biggert-Waters Act of 2012 made a number of changes to the program, such as increasing premiums, to make it “more financially stable.” While that would have gone a long way to restore its fiscal solvency, an outcry from homeowners in high-risk areas led to the 2014 Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act, which limited or rescinded many of the Biggert-Waters rate increases.

Fundamentally, the program that millions of Americans rely on to help them rebuild their lives after a devastating flood needs to be fixed. Its dire financial straits could be resolved by either making taxpayers foot more of the bill or increasing premiums closer to full-cost rates for most homeowners, while also raising total coverage levels.

The Trump administration for its part proposes calculating premiums to more accurately reflect the actual flood risk individual homes face beginning in 2020. This could result in higher rates for many homeowners.

But I believe the government also needs to do more to convince or compel more at-risk homeowners to buy flood insurance – which would be harder to do if it were to raise rates. To me, this suggests that increasing taxpayer support for the program will have to be part of the solution so that pricey premiums don’t become a deterrent to someone buying insurance.

55,55,FF-2019-000029-IDN,"As coastal flooding surges, ‘living shorelines’ seen as the answer - Food & Environment Reporting Network",https://thefern.org/2019/03/as-coastal-flooding-surges-living-shorelines-seen-as-savior/,"On August 27, 2011, Hurricane Irene crashed into North Carolina, eviscerating the Outer Banks. The storm dumped rain shin-high and hurled three-meter storm surges against the barrier island shores that faced the mainland, destroying roads and 1,100 homes.

After the storm, a young ecologist then at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill named Rachel K. Gittman decided to survey the affected areas. Gittman had worked as an environmental consultant for the U.S. Navy on a shoreline-stabilization project and had been shocked to discover how little information existed on coastal resilience. “The more I researched, the more I realized that we just don’t know very much,” she explains. “So much policy and management is being made without the underlying science.” She decided to make shorelines her specialty.

What Gittman found was eye-opening. Along the hard-hit shorelines, three quarters of the bulkheads—typically concrete walls about two meters high that are the standard homeowner defense against the sea in many parts of the country—were damaged. Yet none of the natural marsh shorelines were impaired. The marshes, which extended 10 to 40 meters from the shore, had lost no sediment or elevation from Irene. Although the storm initially reduced the density of their vegetation by more than a third, a year later the greenery had bounced back and was as thick as ever in many cases.

Gittman’s study confirmed what many experts had begun to suspect. “Armored” shorelines such as bulkheads offer less protection against big storms than people think. By reflecting wave energy instead of dispersing it, they tend to wear away at the base, which causes them to gradually tilt seaward. Although they still function well in typical storms, they often backfire when high storm surges overtop them, causing them to breach or collapse, releasing an entire backyard into the sea.

In a later study, Gittman and other researchers surveyed 689 waterfront owners and found that the 37 percent of properties protected by bulkheads had suffered 93 percent of the damage. And bulkhead owners routinely had four times the annual maintenance costs of residents who relied on nature instead. Salt marshes looked soft but did not break.

In recent years, more scientists and policy makers have come to believe that “living shorelines”— natural communities of salt marsh, mangrove, oyster reef, beach and coral reef—can be surprisingly effective in a battle coastal residents have been losing for years. U.S. shores are disintegrating as higher seas, stronger storms and runaway development trigger an epidemic of erosion and flood damage. Every day waves bite off another 89 hectares of the country. Every year another $500 million of property disappears. Overall, some 40 percent of the U.S. coastline is suffering ongoing erosion. In some places, the rate of loss is breathtaking. Go to Google Earth Engine’s Timelapse feature and watch Shackleford Banks melt away like ice cream on a summer sidewalk.

Historically, almost all money spent on coastal defense has gone toward “gray” infrastructure: seawalls, bulkheads, levees and rock revetments. That is beginning to change as researchers become more sophisticated in measuring the long-term impact of “green” coastal defenses. Insurance companies and governments are finally taking notice and might actually turn the tide toward living defenses.

Wetlands outperform walls

Around the time that Hurricane Irene was bowling up the East Coast, Michael W. Beck, a research professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and then lead marine scientist for the Nature Conservancy, was initiating a collaboration with the insurance industry that today may begin to change coastal conservation. “A lot of people were saying that ecosystems worked for flood protection, but the evidence was thin,” Beck tells me at his Santa Cruz office. The physical mechanisms were clear: oyster and coral reefs limited erosion and flood damage by acting as natural breakwaters (offshore seawalls), dispersing wave energy with their corrugated surfaces. Salt marshes and man- groves, with their earthen berms and friction-generating forests of stalks, could rake more than 50 percent of the energy out of storm surges in less than 15 meters of territory.

But although scientists understood the physics, no one had put it into a form that could be used easily by policymakers. Beck set out to rectify that. “If I want to change practices, I can’t bring my ecosystem model to FEMA or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,” he explains. “I have to look at their risk model and put ecosystems into that.”

Beck and his colleagues began collaborating with Lloyd’s of London, Swiss Re and others in the insurance industry, which have some of the best data and models in the world on assets and risk. When he plugged data on coastal ecosystems into their risk models, it became clear that living shorelines were excellent defenses. And, he notes, “when I tell the Corps, FEMA and the development banks that these are the numbers from the insurance industry, I automatically have a different level of credibility.”

The first study focused on damages from Superstorm Sandy, which clobbered New York and New Jersey in 2012. Working with Risk Management Solutions, a leading risk-modeling firm, the scientists showed that wetlands prevented $625 million of flood damage from the storm, which was surprising given that the coasts in the region had already lost 60 to 90 percent of their protective wetlands over time. In areas that flooded, the few remaining wetlands lowered damage by 11 percent on average. As important was the ability to buffer garden-variety floods: in one local study, properties behind marshes suffered 16 percent less annual flood damage than properties that had lost their marshes. “That’s well within the range for which you could expect [insurance] premium reductions,” Beck points out.

He and his partners then turned their economic and risk-management models on the Gulf Coast, from Texas to Florida, which is regularly battered by big storms. They did an exhaustive analysis of the annual expected benefits and costs of all types of infrastructure. The team estimated that the coast would suffer $134 billion of losses over 20 years if no preventive measures were taken. Elevating homes could prevent $39.4 billion of those losses, but it is incredibly expensive. At an average of $83,300 per house, it would cost $54 billion to prevent that $39 billion in damages. The six-meter-high dikes being built in Louisiana were a worse option; at $33,000 per meter, they were an absurdly expensive way to protect a relatively limited amount of property, returning just $1 in savings for every $4 of expense. Smaller levees built on land in front of many low-lying coastal communities prevented much more damage for almost the same cost.

In terms of bang for the buck, sandbags were the best investment, saving $8.4 billion of damages for a mere $0.84 billion in expense. Natural defenses ranked high as well. Wetlands restoration, which could prevent $18.2 billion of losses, would cost just $2 billion. Oyster-reef restoration could prevent $9.7 billion in losses for $1.3 billion. Barrier island restoration offered $5.9 billion of prevention for $1.2 billion. And “beach nourishment” (replenishing depleted beaches with sand dredged from the sea floor) in the eastern Gulf could save $9.3 billion for $5.5 billion.

That last one surprised many people because replacing beach sand year after year is often seen as a fool’s errand. “If the only choices you gave me were beach nourishment versus fully gray infrastructure,” Beck says, “I’d choose the former as the lesser of two evils.”

Overall, the research found that $57.4 of the $134 billion could be prevented cost-effectively, almost all of it through green infrastructure.

One type of restoration that was not part of the study is large-scale diversion of the Mississippi River. Diverting sediment-laden water through a gap in the river’s levees and letting that sediment filter into struggling marshes can restore their health and elevation, but the region is subsiding so quickly that not even the famously muddy Mississippi can save it from the encroaching sea. “It is going to be expensive to recreate an entire ecosystem,” Beck says, “and it is better and cheaper to start earlier.”

Cost-effective restoration may be tricky on long, sandy coasts, too. Beaches and barrier islands are by nature transient. Planting grasses to rebuild dunes can help keep beaches in place but only temporarily in many cases. At some point, residents will have to move back from the receding shoreline.

Beck is quick to point out that built infrastructure is still incredibly important and that cost-effectiveness is not the only consideration. “Anywhere you’ve got significant people and property,” he says, natural solutions will “be used together with some form of built infrastructure.” Metropolitan areas, ports and other places where the risk tolerance for a major flood would be extremely low need seawalls, even if such structures are not cost-effective. Still, Beck says, certain populated areas can benefit from a hybrid approach. “Even if you’re building levees, they can be shorter if they have marshes in front.”

Shoreline trials and errors

One reason living shorelines are becoming an economically viable approach for coastal defense is that researchers and municipalities are getting better at rebuilding them. Early marsh-restoration designs, which followed forestry science and gave each plant plenty of space to avoid competition, were actually counterproductive. It turns out that in bare mud flats, “when marsh plants are together, they share oxygen, so their growth rate is twice as high,” says Brian Silliman, an ecologist at Duke University. Root them in large clumps, and the growth rate of each individual plant can triple. Add blue crabs, which eat the snails that eat the salt-marsh grasses, and the plants do even better. Scientists are also finding that marshes do best when they have a protective sill—a linear berm that fronts the seaside edge of the grass and stands. Made of hard material such as shell, stone or concrete, its height and position are typically chosen so that water covers it at high tide, but it is exposed during low tide. The sill takes the brunt of wave energy but also traps sediment behind it, allowing the grass to thrive and marsh floor to retain its elevation or even rise.

Almost any hard material can make a successful sill. Large shoreline-stabilization projects use big boulders or stackable concrete blocks, a practice that has been criticized by some experts who say that these structures are living shorelines in name only. But many lower-profile restorations integrate sills more seamlessly into the natural habitat. In the Southeast and Gulf Coast regions, marshes historically possessed a natural sill in the form of an intertidal oyster reef. Many of those reefs were overharvested long ago, ruining the sill and exposing the marshes to erosion.

In these warm, oyster-friendly waters, new sills can be formed by placing a hard substrate along the low-tide line at the front edge of the marsh for baby oysters to set on. Some sites with lots of wave action have used small, hollow concrete structures or plastic mesh “onion bags” studded with shell and lashed together. When successful, these artificial materials are quickly covered by oysters and disappear into the interstices of the growing reef. But the concrete often remains visible for years, and the bags have been criticized for breaking and scattering plastic through the environment.

Gittman, now at East Carolina University, is testing an alternative material called Oyster Catcher that is made of jute cloth dipped in Portland cement and rolled into various hollow configurations. It hardens with extensive surface area to recruit larval oysters. In addition to being light and flexible, it holds together just long enough to get a reef established, then disintegrates. The product received its first big test when Hurricanes Florence and Michael struck North Carolina last fall. Michael tossed shell bags up into the marshes, but the Oyster Catcher reefs didn’t budge. The showing was encouraging, but Gittman worries that conservation groups may oversell the potential. “A living shoreline can’t save your house from a Category 5 storm,” she says. “Although neither can a bulkhead.”

Gittman and Beck both stress the need to tailor living shorelines to local conditions. One reason oyster restoration is so cost-effective in the Gulf and the Southeast is because there have been plentiful wild oysters to seed new reefs with babies. That is not the case in most of the country. Chesapeake Bay, for example, was long the poster child for futile oyster restoration. Oyster populations in the bay had fallen to less than 1 percent of historical norms, and decades of effort and tens of millions of dollars barely budged the needle.

“Conceptually, Chesapeake Bay was not our best model,” Beck says. “It put oyster-reef restoration back because it made it look so difficult and expensive. Well, when you’re working in a system where you’ve only got 1 percent left, guess what? It ain’t easy. When you’re in the Gulf of Mexico and you’ve still got 50 percent of your reefs left, it’s a different story. If you build it, the oysters will come.”

Beck extends that lesson to coral reefs, the most underappreciated of natural defenses. “Coral reefs are the single most effective ecosystem for flood-risk reduction,” he says. Corals, which have evolved to take a daily pounding that would destroy most other living things, form natural seawalls exactly where you want them—just offshore, in front of resorts, beach towns, coastal roads and other pricey assets. When healthy, they make remarkably effective breakwaters, reducing wave energy up to 97 percent. They are also affordable: reef restoration averages about $1,300 per meter, versus $20,000 for artificial breakwater construction. The insurance industry’s assessment for mitigating risk from climate change in the Caribbean found that reviving reefs and mangroves was an order of magnitude more cost-effective than seawalls or breakwaters.

Even though reefs do not line a lot of shorefronts, the annual expected benefits they generate are significant—more than $100 million a year in the U.S. alone and more than $400 million a year each in Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Cuba.

Of course, many coral reefs are not healthy, and losing just a single meter of reef height doubles the direct damages from flooding. For that reason alone, Beck believes reef-restoration projects will multiply. Although the science of coral restoration is young, the potential is enormous—so long as a reef has not already collapsed. “Some of these corals actually grow pretty fast,” Beck says. “For example, in places in Indonesia where there’s still good reef habitat and lots of healthy corals around small sites that have been destroyed by blast fishing, reefs can turn around pretty quickly.”

Rising tide of support

Coastal restoration may finally be getting the attention it deserves. “Things are really beginning to change,” Beck says. The Army Corps, which for decades has favored hardscape solutions, has launched an Engineering With Nature initiative—something many planners thought they would never see. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has made living shorelines a centerpiece of its coastal-resilience blueprint. Hundreds of projects have been completed or are underway around the country, ranging from shoreline stabilizations in Maryland to levee removal in Puget Sound. Most are small, community-based efforts, but larger ventures are becoming more common.

Stimulus funding that flowed after the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 increased the size of some projects significantly. Kilometers of oyster-reef projects now line Alabama, Texas and Louisiana. The flagship is Coffee Island, off the Alabama coast. The shoreline had receded up to 100 meters. The Nature Conservancy placed a three-kilometer-long line of shell bags and concrete balls about 30 meters offshore, paralleling the island. The reef immediately blocked wave energy, allowing the marsh to rebuild. Within two years approximately 200 baby oysters per square meter had colonized the structure, covering it and attracting fish, crabs and birds.

Outside the Gulf Coast and the Southeast, restoration projects may be more challenging. California, for example, is a tough challenge. “In San Francisco Bay,” Beck says, “we’ve lost more than 90 percent of the natural marshes, so you have to go in and recreate an environment wholesale in and around a hell of a lot of people.”

Yet where there is a will—and local money—there is a way. The San Francisco Bay Clean Water, Pollution Prevention, and Habitat Restoration Measure, passed by Bay Area voters in 2016, raises $25 million a year for 20 years through a parcel tax. That $500 million will be used to build 40,000 hectares of wetlands — the largest shoreline restoration undertaken in the U.S.—using various techniques. The most novel is horizontal levees. Instead of a high, narrow mound that lines the shore, horizontal levees are broad mud flats, marshes and grasslands that gradually rise from the water’s edge for hundreds of meters back onto the land. They are graded with vast amounts of earth (often repurposed from building projects) and planted with starter plugs. They can be lower and 40 percent less costly than a traditional levy because the depth absorbs floodwater. The configuration also gives marsh communities space to retreat as seas rise.

Another encouraging sign is the Living Shorelines Act, introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Frank Pallone, whose New Jersey district was devastated by Superstorm Sandy. The bill would designate $20 million in grants a year to living- shoreline projects. A Senate version was introduced by Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kamala Harris of California. Their prospects in the current Congress were uncertain at press time, but their existence shows that living shorelines are gaining ground.

North Carolina’s Coastal Resources Commission recently approved a new process that will make it as easy to obtain a living-shoreline permit as that for a bulkhead. Maryland has an even stronger law in place, requiring a homeowner to prove why a bulkhead is needed instead of a natural shoreline. Other states may follow these leads.

The most promising indication of all may be the 2018 agreement made by the Nature Conservancy, the reinsurance industry and the Mexican state of Quintana Roo to create a trust fund to protect the Mesoamerican Reef, off the coast of Cancún and Puerto Morelos. The deal will include the first insurance policy ever taken out on a natural ecosystem. If the reef is damaged by a storm, insurance funds are released to rebuild its natural capital.

For living shorelines to become an important part of any long-term coastal defense plan, policymakers in government, insurance and development will have to start improving and installing them before bad storms hit—and funding the next round of projects through post-disaster spending. That requires good science and good economic numbers—which now exist—as well as good proof in the form of demonstration projects, which are increasingly common.

The first significant examples of post-disaster spending on natural infrastructure could occur as FEMA and other agencies look to spend more than $100 billion in recovery funds from recent hurricanes. Although FEMA’s traditional hazard-mitigation investments have focused on tactics such as buying out damaged coastal homes or elevating them, the agency has adjusted its new “benefit-cost analysis” policy to favor investment in natural infrastructure. Beck expects this change in emphasis to result in federally funded projects of unprecedented scope in Florida, Puerto Rico and the Gulf Coast. Other large-scale development may soon follow worldwide as governments, disaster-risk managers, businesses, banks and insurers look to mitigate their risk exposure as cost-effectively as possible. When that happens, it will mark a moment when society realizes nature is not a luxury. It is the future.

Hundreds have been killed across three African countries: Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe.

Nearly 90 percent of Beira has been damaged or destroyed, the Red Cross says.

Mozambique's president said he thinks the death toll could top 1,000. Mozambique's central port city of Beira continues to pick up the pieces days after it was battered by tropical Cyclone Idai.

The cyclone has killed hundreds across three countries: Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, the Associated Press reports. Hundreds more are missing.

Thousands of homes were destroyed and power was cut off in Beira, home to more than 500,000 people. The city's main hospital incurred significant damage, the AP also reports.

On Tuesday, government officials and aid agencies scrambled to rescue families still trapped by rising rivers that burst their banks.

After flying over the devastated port city of Beira on Monday, Mozambique’s President Filipe Nyusi said he thinks the death toll in his country could top 1,000 people.

""...when we flew over the area ... this morning to understand what's going on, everything indicates that we could register more than 1,000 deaths,"" Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi said in a nationwide address.

""This is a real humanitarian disaster,"" he said. ""More than 100,000 people are in danger.""

People were reportedly taking refuge in trees awaiting rescue, Nyusi added, noting that the Pungwe and Buzi rivers in central Mozambique ""have burst their banks and engulfed entire villages.""

""Communities are isolated and bodies are floating"" on the waters, he said, according to AFP.

Beira was cut off from the rest of the world after Idai made landfall late Thursday as a Category 3 storm, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said Monday. A large dam burst on Sunday, cutting off the last road to Beira, Agence France-Presse reports.

""We've never had something of this magnitude before in Mozambique,"" said Emma Beaty, coordinator of a grouping of NGOs known as Cosaco, AFP reports. ""Some dams have broken, and others have reached full capacity, they'll very soon open the flood gates. It's a convergence of flooding, cyclones, dams breaking and making a potential wave: everything's in place so we get a perfect storm.""

Advertisement The scale of the damage to Beira is ""massive and horrifying,"" said Jamie LeSueur, who led a Red Cross aerial assessment of the city. The team had to view the city by helicopter because roads were flooded, he said.

""The situation is terrible. The scale of devastation is enormous. It seems that 90 percent of the area is completely destroyed,"" said LeSueur.

After hitting Beira late Thursday, the cyclone moved westward into Zimbabwe and Malawi, affecting thousands more.

At least 126 people had died in Mozambique and Malawi, according to the AP. In Zimbabwe, 98 people have died from the floods, the country's information ministry said Monday.

The coastal town of Chinde, about 250 miles northeast of Beira, also incurred significant damage, INGC told news agencies. Villages in the vicinity were also cut off by storm surge.

In Malawi, the government confirmed 56 death and said 577 were injured and three people remained missing, the AP reports.

Images posted to social media show damage to homes, downed trees and roofs ripped from buildings.

Nearly 200 students were trapped in a school in the mountains of Zimbabwe after it was slammed by a mudslide unleashed by Idai, BBC.com reported.

At least two of the students died when rocks from the mudslide knocked down a wall while the students slept, the report added. The Charles Lwanga Secondary School is in eastern Zimbabwe's Chimanimani district. More than 100 houses also have been damaged in the area, according to Zimbabwe's information ministry.

According to Relief Web, the storm damaged schools and medical facilities. The organization also noted that there is a heightened risk of water-borne diseases due to damage to sanitation facilities and unsafe water.""

Before landfall, the system that later formed into Idai produced flooding that killed at least 122 people in Mozambique and Malawi, making it the deadliest weather disaster of 2019.

The initial system killed at least 66 people due to flooding in Mozambique, Agence France-Presse reported. Flooding from that system destroyed more than 5,700 homes and impacted more than 140,000 people in the southern African country.","Tue, 19 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.w-x.co/mozambique.jpg,"['dead', 'cyclone', 'cross', 'mozambique', 'malawi', 'homes', 'zimbabwe', 'horrifying', 'thousands', 'idai', 'damage', 'flooding', 'beira', 'hundreds', 'massive', 'destruction', 'destroyed', 'red']",

The floodwaters have inundated a large swath of farm states Iowa and Nebraska along the Missouri River, North America's longest river, prompting half of Iowa's 99 counties to declare states of emergency.

""Touched down in Omaha, Nebraska to survey flood damage & thank volunteers & emergency personnel,"" Pence said on Twitter, in a post that included photos of him meeting with the governors of both states and lawmakers.

""The hearts of the American people are with those who have been impacted across the Midwest!"" Pence said in the tweet.

An aerial photo shows flooding along the Missouri An aerial photo shows flooding along the Missouri River in Pacific Junction, Iowa, March 19, 2019. An aerial photo shows flooding along the Missouri River in Pacific Junction, Iowa, March 19, 2019.

Nebraska, Iowa and Wisconsin have all declared states of emergency in the floods, which stem from a powerful winter hurricane known as a ""bomb cyclone"" that slammed into the U.S. Farm Belt last week, killing untold numbers of livestock, destroying grains and soybeans in storage, and cutting off access to farms because of road and rail damage.

The latest confirmed death was identified by the sheriff in Fremont County, Iowa, as 55-year-old Aleido Rojas Galan, who was pulled from floodwaters along with another man on Friday and later succumbed to injuries.

A Nebraska man who has been missing since the collapse of the Spencer Dam last week on the Niobrara River was identified by the Omaha World-Herald newspaper as Kenny Angel.

Authorities said they had rescued nearly 300 people in Nebraska alone, with some rivers continuing to rise.

Rescuers could be seen in boats pulling pets from flooded homes. Some roadways crumbled to rubble, while sections of others were submerged. In Hamburg, Iowa, floodwaters covered buildings.

In Brownville, Nebraska, floodwaters lapped at the edge of the small town of 132 people, closing the main bridge across the Missouri River.

$1 Billion in Damage

""It's a lot worse than I've ever seen it,"" said Malina Wheeldon, who went ahead with the scheduled opening of her new Euphoric Soul Salon & Boutique business despite the floods. Her husband, Justin, who grew up in Brownville, agreed, saying he had lived through the floods of 1993, 2010 and 2011.

""About every five years now, we have a 100-year flood,"" he said.

The Missouri was expected to crest at 47.5 feet (14.5 m) on Tuesday, breaking its 2011 record by more than a foot (31 cm), the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency said. The flooding was expected to continue through Thursday.

Nebraska officials estimated more than $1 billion in flood damage for the state's agricultural sector so far, according to Craig Head, vice president of issue management at the Nebraska Farm Bureau. Head said the number was expected to grow as floodwaters recede.

""It's really too early to know for sure how bad this is going to get. But one thing we do know: It's catastrophic for farmers,"" said Matt Perdue, government relations director for the National Farmers Union trade group. ""We're hoping it's only $1 billion, but that's only a hope.""

Nebraska officials estimate the floods have caused $553 million in damage to public infrastructure and other assets, as well as $89 million in privately owned assets, according to the state's Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday.

The water also covered about a third of Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska, home to the U.S. Strategic Command, whose responsibilities include defending against and responding to nuclear attacks.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is distributing 400,000 sandbags to operators of 12 levees along the Missouri River in Missouri and Kansas that were in danger of being breached by floodwaters, the Army Corps said in a news release on Tuesday.

In Niobrara, Nebraska, south of the Missouri River near the border with South Dakota, Mayor Jody Stark said flooding that began on Thursday had devastated his community of 350 people, with businesses being the hardest hit.

""Our road system is shot pretty much in every direction coming into town,"" Stark said.

""It's one day at a time. We will do what we can to get back on our feet,"" Stark said. ""It's just so heartbreaking. It's going to be tough, but hopefully we can all get through it.""

The floodwaters were the result of snowmelt following heavy rains last week and warm weather, said Bob Oravec, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center.

Roads leading to the Nebraska Public Power District's Cooper nuclear plant near Brownville were engulfed by floodwaters from the Missouri, but the facility was still operating safely at full power on Tuesday.

The plant operator was flying staff members and supplies to the plant with helicopters, said power district spokesman Mark Becker.","Tue, 19 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/D4F8B4FF-275E-48D2-B1BD-3A510E14936D.jpg,"['floods', 'iowa', 'missouri', 'states', 'hardhit', 'midwest', 'reels', 'floodwaters', 'pence', 'historic', 'nebraska', 'tours', 'flooding', 'river', 'national', 'ashland']",

63,63,FF-2019-000029-IDN,More than just free rides: Educating MRT commuters will help mitigate risks - Jakarta Post,https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2019/03/21/more-than-just-free-rides-educating-mrt-commuters-will-help-mitigate-risks.html,"In March 2019, Jakarta will open its MRT to transport 2 million commuters every day.

As I was strolling along Thamrin, one of Jakarta’s central business districts, after a work-related visit in the area, I could see modern, well-lit subway stations that were still closed but manned by security guards. I felt like I was transported to a European city with minimalist, ultra-modern stations. I couldn’t wait to see what the subway would look like with PT MRT Jakarta's promised shopping arcades and other amenities.

The reason why we need transportation is that we need to go from our residence to our workplace or places where we can relax and have fun. There are many ways of satisfying this need but we will choose the fastest and most affordable option, which will give us the most satisfaction. We are only satisfied if our expectations match our experience. We expect that our MRT ride will be safe, on time, comfortable and affordable. A lot of factors will be involved to make this possible, which is mainly a combination of training MRT employees in operating the trains and providing customer service to commuters, the ease in the use of MRT facilities and the attitude and behavior of commuters.

As this is a new mode of transportation in Jakarta, the general public needs to be educated on how to use the facilities, what to do in case of emergency and how to properly behave in the surrounding areas of the stations and inside the train itself. Free rides provided by MRT Jakarta will be helpful in this regard.

MRT Jakarta CEO William Sabandar, serving as one of the speakers during the national conference on “Managing Risk in a Disruptive Era” on Dec 12 and 13 last year, implied that free rides will provide feedback and help correct whatever minor technical and human errors that may arise in the operation of the MRT. They may simulate an earthquake to gauge commuters’ reaction and see how prepared employees are in coping with unexpected situations.

Free rides are provided between March 12 and 24 before the MRT is opened to the public. Registration for these free rides opened on March 5 at Bukalapak, but when I checked on March 6, the available slots were only for March 15 and 18 to 22. In just a day, weekend free rides were gone. This goes to show that Jakartans are really looking forward to experiencing their first MRT ride.

MRT employees and their managers have gone through various training programs and will teach commuters how to use the new facilities and handle unexpected events that may occur. These unexpected events vary from low to high frequency; with insignificant to catastrophic impacts.

Anticipating problems before they arise will ensure commuters arrive at their intended destination safely and provide a positive experience that will help spread positive word-of-mouth experiences regarding this mode of transportation.

What may these unexpected events or risks be? It may vary from natural disasters such as low-to-high intensity earthquakes and floods to those committed by humans such as terrorism. Although the possibility of these events is quite low, the impact would be huge.

We have to learn how Japan copes with frequent earthquakes. Bullet trains in Japan are equipped with sensors that stop the train when an earthquake occurs. In the 2011 9.0-magnitude earthquake, there were 27 bullet trains in operation. The sensors worked perfectly. Triggered by the smaller pre-quakes, the trains stopped before the major earthquake occurred and no injuries nor deaths ensued.

Another lesson we can learn from Japan is regarding the sarin attack in 1995 that resulted in 12 deaths and injuries to thousands of commuters, employees and first responders from the police and military. The New York Times reported on March 21, 1995, that the sarin gas was transported in liquid form inside lunch boxes and bottled drinks and left in subway stations and trains. No personnel were trained to respond to a terrorist attack using weapons of mass destruction at that time. To help prevent more people from being hurt, since these are unexpected events that no one can foresee, commuters are encouraged to report any bags, boxes or personal effects that are left unattended anywhere in stations and inside trains. More so, with the real threat of terrorism, everyone must help in reporting suspicious individuals or people who act in a strange way.

Unexpected events are, well, unexpected. The management of the MRT anticipated this before the project began with risk management procedures in place during construction and in operations. But as commuters, we better not just hope that these situations will not arise.

First, we must always follow the rules. The rules might be posted on walls or broadcasted through speakers. Second, we must not panic when something out of the ordinary happens.

Third, we must report any unusual packages, bags or boxes lying unattended in the stations or trains. This would include reporting people whose actions would lead you to believe that they intend to do harm.

I still couldn’t imagine how rush hours would look like but if I based it on my experience in using Transjakarta buses, there will be some pushing and shoving. We need to plan our trips and avoid rush hours, especially when we are taking babies and toddlers with us.

MRTs, light rapid transits and trams are the public transportation of today and the near future. We must be able to use them properly so that they will fulfill their purpose of making us more productive and efficient in the use of our time and make Indonesian cities more habitable and humane.

The National Guard units from Nebraska and Minnesota stepped in to help with Operation Prairie Hay Drop to keep the cattle sustained during the critical calving season. (Ben Murray / Military Times)

The National Guard is helping communities throughout the Midwest affected by intense flooding.

More than 340 guardsmen are working in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and other states to aid those impacted by unexpectedly high floodwaters.

The Army believes the flooding was worse than usual this year due to abnormally high temperatures that led to more storms and melted snow.

National Guard members have responded to this disaster by working with state and local officials to search for and rescue those trapped in flood-affected areas, get first-responders to those in need and provide food and water to the Midwest communities.

""It comes down to protecting [the] community,"" said Air Force Maj. Michael Mitchell, medical plans officer for Missouri Air National Guard’s 139th Airlift Wing. ""We've got a lot of manpower, a lot of hands here, and we're coming together with the civilian force they've got here.""

The Army Corps of Engineers reported that floodwaters have overtaken rivers and breached 26 levees so far. Guard members are trying to combat those breaches with 2,000-pound sandbags that are being dropped in by helicopters to plug holes.

In addition to the major problems, the National Guard is also trying to solve flood-related issues on a more granular level.

For example, the South Dakota Army National Guard’s Company A, 139th Brigade Support Battalion has been working with authorities at the Native-American Pine Ridge Reservation to bring them clean drinking water after floodwaters destroyed a local water line.

In Nebraska, Army guardsmen with the state’s Company B, 2nd Battalion, 135th Aviation Regiment dropped bales of hay via helicopter for stranded cows.

Was climate change behind Cyclone Idai?

Cyclone Idai whipped its fury on the coastline of Mozambique last week, causing major loss of life and widespread destruction: It is estimated that 90% of the port town of Beira has been destroyed.

As scenes of devastation continue to unfold, the BBC asks, what role did climate change play in the disaster?

According to the report, the cause is unlikely to be determined, unless a private donor materialises the funds. Scientists who are skilled, simply don’t have access to the resources required to complete the amount of computer modelling to find the answer. Though the number of tropical storms hasn’t increased with climate change, the frequency of high intensity ones has. More moisture in the atmosphere creates more rainfall, rising sea levels raise the damage caused by floods, and warmer seas give cyclones more energy.

Oil giants: Put your money where your mouth is!

An investigation into the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies has revealed spends of USD 110 billion in new oil and gas projects, despite spending USD 1 billion in climate change policy lobbying and green PR. The increased spends on fossil fuel projects dwarfs that of low-carbon investments by the giants, which stands at USD 3.6 billion. Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron BP and Total accelerated the promotion of their green energy projects following the Paris Agreement, whereby nearly all of Earth’s nations agreed to cut emissions.

The ‘reckless disparity,’ according to the Huffington Post, follows the United Nation’s International Panel on Climate Change report in October that warned if fossil fuels weren’t phased out in the next decade, ‘catastrophic’ damage to the planet will ensue. The world is currently on track for a 3 degree Celsius increase in temperature, doubling the recommended limit of 1.5 degrees.

The report by Influencer Map, found that since the Paris Agreement was reached three years ago, the aforementioned oil companies have spent USD 195 million per year promoting their role in battling climate change, while spending USD 965 million a year marketing other sustainable projects. Some of these advertisements can be found on top influencer sites such as The New York Times and Washington Post. Though adverts appeared worldwide, those residing in the USA were targeted most frequently.

Order on the oil

A US federal judge has halted hundreds of drilling projects on public land in Wyoming, after ruling that the Trump administration had failed to “sufficiently address climate change,” The Hill reports. The landmark decision will be at odds with the president’s plans to expand the fossil fuel industry’s access to public lands. The ruling also comes before an awaited five-year plan to expand offshore oil and gas drilling by the Interior Department, which is expected to irk environmentalists and coastal governments.

EU palm oil phase out sparks fighting talk from Malaysia

Malaysian Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, has responded to the EU’s decision to phase out palm oil by threatening to purchase its fighter jets from countries such as China, in replace of European arms dealers, News Asia reports. A European Commission report recently found that 45 percent of oil palm expansion over the last decade has resulted in forests, wetlands and peatlands destruction, which in turn resulted in more greenhouse gas emissions. Malaysia- the world’s second largest exporter of palm oil- has said it will take the European bloc to the World Trade Organization over the ruling. Indonesia’s Jakarta Post claims the EU came to their decision using 2008 – 2015 data, which doesn’t take into consideration a deforestation downturn in 2017. The Indonesian government implemented a palm oil moratorium after 2015’s forests fires in Riau, which caused mass deforestation and a public health crisis.

Bali officials detain Russian man suspected of drugging and smuggling orangutan

A Russian tourist in Bali has been detained after airport officials found a drugged orangutan in his hand luggage, ABC reports. Twenty-seven year-old Andrei Zhestov claims he bought the orangutan for USD 4200 to keep as a pet, though two tokay geckos and four chameleons were also discovered in the man’s belongings on further investigation. Orangutans are critically endangered and on the IUCN Red List.

Brazil’s indigenous fearful of their future

In an interview with The New York Times, one of Brazil’s best known indigenous leaders, Sônia Guajajara, claims Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro, has reversed 30 years of progress in his first 50 days of government. Agencies that work to strengthen and protect indigenous rights and the Amazon rainforest have already been weakened or defunded, and responsibilities for their oversight passed to the pro-farming, pro-mining, pro-timber agriculture ministry. The article reports that Mr. Bolsonaro wants “collective lands-” where indigenous groups have exclusive use of government owned lands under the Constitution- to be more “productive.” The populist leader has also publicly announced that “there is no such thing as an indigenous people.” As well as her concerns for the planet if the Amazon rainforest is jeopardised, Ms. Guajajara believes the president’s moves will result in ethnocide. “Ethnocide is when you kill the culture. Genocide is when you kill the people,” she said.

Many villages remain cut-off by massive rains that hit Mozambique’s coast earlier this month, swamping huge areas of the country and neighboring Malawi and Zimbabwe, killing hundreds. The United Nations says about 1,200 Mozambicans fled across the border to evacuation camps in Malawi, where relief supplies are under strain.

Malawi’s Department of Disaster Management and Preparedness says nearly a million people in half the country’s districts have been impacted by Cyclone Idai.



Half of them are children.



“The situation in the camps is quite bad,"" said

Andrew Brown, Chief of Communications in Malawi for the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund. ""Actually, right now I am in Bangula Admarc camp in Nsanje (district). And there is over 4,000 people here. And there is 3,400 Malawians and actually 1,200 Mozambicans who have crossed the river. Resources are stretched.”

UNICEF partners - including Doctors Without Borders, the Red Cross, United Purpose, and World Vision - are helping deliver relief supplies.



Brown says these include oral re-hydration solution, antibiotics, and insecticide-treated bed nets.



“We are also providing water buckets making sure they have access to clean water,"" he said. ""Making sure that children are screened for malnutrition and are treated. We are training and providing temporary teachers to help with increased number of children. And we are creating child friendly spaces and we have recreation kits so that the kids living in these very crowded camps actually have somewhere safe to play.”

Some hundreds are dead, many more still missing and thousands at risk from massive flooding across the region including Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe caused by Cyclone Idai.

UNICEF last week made an urgent appeal for $8 million in funding to meet the immediate and medium-term needs of women and children in flood-affected areas.



Authorities say some areas of Malawi, like Nyachikadza and East Bank, are inaccessible due to cut-off roads and washed-away bridges.



District Commissioner for Nsanje Reinghard Chavula says getting aid to those in need is a challenge.



“We had a help of a helicopter and we were able to send the food through the helicopter but still what we need are the roads to be maintained otherwise we can’t have the helicopter all the time,"" Chavula said.



Despite the relief efforts, Chavula says thousands in Malawi are still in dire need of shelter, food and medical assistance.



Malawi President Peter Mutharika declared 14 affected districts disaster areas and appealed for help.

Now the country is working to restore these historic swamps by embracing rather than fighting their boggy nature.

The fires have served as a wake-up call for the government, which in 2016 promised to dam and fill in canals across nearly 8,000 square miles of peatland by 2020. Slowly, dryland crops are giving way to swamp-faring flora such as the sago palm. Today, locals in Sumatra view the sago with reverence. “This is like villagers’ savings,” says Abdul Manan, motioning to his 12-acre stand of sago, “to pay for the children to go to school, to middle school, to university.”

When severe drought hit in 1997, thousands of years’ worth of undecayed plant matter burst into flames. The whole country seemed to burn, releasing as much as 10 billion tons of CO₂ in several months – almost twice as much as the entire United States produces in a year. Conflagrations now recur nearly every dry season.

Peatlands aren’t supposed to catch fire; they are soggy bogs, after all. But over the past 20 years, Indonesia’s peatlands have become tinderboxes as corporate plantation growers drained these historic swamps to grow oil palm and acacia.

A picket fence encloses a single sago palm in Sungai Tohor, a village of 1,300 on the coast of Sumatra. A billboard to the right gives title to the bushy tree: the Jokowi Sago Monument. Jokowi is the nickname of Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo. The tree was planted in his honor when he visited in 2014.

Abdul Manan, the farmer and entrepreneur who drives me to the sago shrine on the back of his beat-up motorcycle, says it’s no surprise that villagers are proud of this palm. Sago is the most important crop in this part of Indonesia.

“This is like villagers’ savings,” he says, “to pay for the children to go to school, to middle school, to university.”

Why We Wrote This One-size-fits-all agriculture has robbed Indonesia’s peatlands of their moisture. Now the country is working to restore these historic swamps by embracing rather than fighting their boggy nature.

Mr. Manan himself owns a 12-acre stand of sago and a mill for grinding up its pulp, an edible starch. He produces packets of coconut-flavored balls of roasted sago and bags of sago pasta.

Just before President Widodo’s visit, wildfires had swept through Sungai Tohor and other parts of the province of Riau. Fires have devastated Borneo – an island that Indonesia shares with Malaysia and Brunei – and Sumatra for decades. The incessant blazes reduce oil palm and acacia plantations to ashes and incinerate dwindling patches of natural forest, home to orangutans and pygmy rhinos. Fires have exposed millions of Indonesians, Singaporeans, and Malaysians to toxic air pollution.

Indonesia’s wildfires also release vast amounts of carbon dioxide (CO₂), contributing to global warming, embarrassing the Indonesian government, and impeding international efforts to slow climate change. Further conversion of forest to fire-prone industrial plantations “ must be stopped ,” President Widodo declared to an entourage of Indonesian journalists during his stay at Sungai Tohor. Give the land to family farmers instead, the president said, “so they can use it to plant sago.” Mr. Manan, the sort of small-time grower he was talking about, listened at the edge of the crowd.

President Widodo’s pronouncements may have helped to create a recent surge in sago production. It certainly raised the visibility of the cultivation of swamp-adapted trees, a fire-resistant form of farming dubbed paludiculture. If widely adopted, paludiculture could make Indonesia’s land less prone to fires, protecting the health of residents and cutting off a globally significant source of CO₂ emissions. It would also protect the long-term viability of farming on Indonesia’s coastal plains, where fires have been a persistent problem.

The dryland illusion

Hans Joosten, an ecology professor at Germany’s University of Greifswald, says Indonesia’s fire troubles can be traced, literally, to the dawn of Western civilization.

“The Western way of agriculture has as its cradle the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East,” he says, an arid region with infrequent rainfall.

The ancestral agriculturalists of European civilization domesticated plants and animals and developed tools and techniques for dry conditions. Europeans later adopted the “dryland philosophy,” spreading it, along with the empires, around the world. After conquests, they favored adopting dryland crops – potatoes and corn, for example – even where farmers also grew wetland plants.

Professor Joosten says this history led to “the illusion that productive land has to be dry,” even though “wetlands belong to the most productive areas in the world.”

Even rice – a seeming exception, farmed in flooded fields – requires dry soil for part of the year. It won’t grow in perpetually soggy ground.

Wetlands are common around the world, yet they’re seldom farmed before being drained. Most farms in the Netherlands, where Professor Joosten grew up, were natural wetlands before settlers “reclaimed” the land by drying it with its legendary network of dikes and canals.

Until the past several decades, waterlogged peatland covered in dense jungle completely rimmed Sumatra and Kalimantan – Indonesia’s portion of Borneo – a Florida-size area. Peatlands are wetlands in which dead trees’ roots rot exceedingly slowly. The undecayed plant matter builds up year after year, creating deep, spongy deposits.

Only indigenous tribes – who hunted monkeys and indigenous pigs there – paid much attention to Indonesia’s peatlands. The soggy jungle floor defied mechanized equipment, blocking industrial logging. None of Indonesia’s major crops tolerate their perpetually high water.

Peatlands store huge amounts of carbon – up to 100 times as much as the wood in trunks and branches of the trees that grow on them. Indonesia’s peatlands, which have accumulated for 15,000 years, are 60 feet deep in places.

In contrast to other wetlands, peatlands become highly flammable when drained. In Ireland and other parts of the world, dried peat heats homes and fuels power plants. Because of their immense volume, Indonesia’s peatlands generate huge amounts of CO₂ and continental-scale clouds of toxic pollution when they catch fire.

But the virgin peatlands rarely burned. Peatland jungles are quite fireproof. Mr. Manan, the sago farmer, shows me why.

“Roll up your pants,” he says, tucking his into the cuffs of rubber boots. Springy soil squishes noisily underfoot.

A few steps into the woods, he brushes away a tangle of palm fronds, revealing a PVC pipe sticking a few inches above the ground. He pulls out a long, straight dowel that, like a car’s dipstick, measures the position of the forest’s water table. Reddish droplets – tannin and other decay products in peat-color groundwater – drip off the end, showing that the water table is only a couple feet below the surface. Even during Sumatra’s dry season, Mr. Manan says, the combination of groundwater below and rainwater above keeps the soil sopping wet.

Daniel Grossman Sago tree trunks are made of almost pure starch extracted in mills like this one in Sumatra. Logs cut into yardlong sections are roped together in long rafts pulled on canals from plantations. Their fibrous bark, shown in the foreground, is trimmed off, revealing the white pith inside for processing.

A fiery ‘wake-up call’

The tranquil preindustrial state of the peatlands ended in the 1990s. Timber companies began running out of easy-to-harvest upland trees and turned their attention to the less-accessible swamps. Between 1990 and 2015, woodcutters harvested nearly three-quarters of the peatland forests on Sumatra and Kalimantan, an area half the size of the United Kingdom. The cleared ground was too soggy for dryland crops. But companies with government concessions excavated thousands of miles of canals, dehydrating the soil. Then they planted oil palm, to satisfy the exploding global demand for biofuels and alternatives to hydrogenated oil, and fast-growing acacia trees, a source of paper pulp. Family farmers, with little capital and no relevant expertise, rarely made use of these cleared swamps. They’d always carved their garden plots from dryland parcels layered with fertile mineral sediments on riverbanks.

The corporate plantation growers sowed the saplings of their own destruction, however. For years experts warned that the plantations’ drained peat was dangerously flammable. They also said that the desiccated wetlands would subside. In its natural state, peat is up to 95 percent water. Once dehydrated, it compacts and slumps year after year. Eventually the surface sinks below sea level. Unless protected by dikes and continuously pumped – methods employed in the Netherlands but impossibly expensive in Indonesia – the land becomes inundated with salt water and infertile.

In late 1997 Indonesia suffered a scorching drought. As predicted, the peatlands burst into flames. The whole country seemed to burn. One estimate suggests that between 7 and 34 percent of Indonesia’s peatlands ignited. Scientists piecing together what happened later calculated that the fires released 3 to 10 billion tons CO₂ in several months, possibly as much as the entire United States and all of Europe produce in a year.

The fires were “a wake-up call,” says Wim Giesen, a Dutch consultant with Euroconsult Mott MacDonald, who has advised the Indonesian government how to respond. Still, Indonesia continued draining peatlands carelessly for two more decades.

Conflagrations now recur nearly every dry season, turning Indonesia into the third-highest source of climate-warming CO₂.

In 2015, the smoke was so thick “you couldn’t see the house across the street,” recalls Laura Graham, a biologist at the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation. Dr. Graham works in Palangkaraya, a city carved from peatlands in Kalimantan, where she monitors efforts to restore damaged forest. Pollution from 2015’s fires killed 100,000 people in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. The World Bank has concluded that it cost Indonesia $16 billion in economic damage.

“The good thing about the 2015 fires,” says Dr. Graham, “was that people finally stood up and said ‘We can’t keep doing this.’ ”

Nurturing a paradigm shift

In January 2016, President Widodo created the Peatland Restoration Agency, an arm of the government for coordinating efforts to rewet desiccated swamps. The goal is to dam and fill in canals across 2 million hectares (nearly 8,000 square miles) of peatland by 2020.

What’s needed is “a paradigm shift in thinking, going from crops that require drainage to crops that require rewetting,” says Marcel Silvius, the Indonesia representative of the Global Green Growth Institute, an environmental group operated by 30 member countries. Many peatland experts want the government to raise water tables to natural conditions, where water bubbled up above the surface of some land during the wet season and dropped to just below otherwise. But this would end oil palm and acacia production on a territory larger than Belgium. The government has split the difference, requiring that water tables be raised slightly but not so high as to endanger industrial plantations. Still, a shift from dryland agriculture to paludiculture has begun.

After touring Sungai Tohor’s sago groves and pulping mills, Mr. Manan drives home, showers, and changes into a fresh sarong, a traditional batik shirt, and a black velvet peci, the fez-like hat Indonesian men wear on formal occasions. Seated on the floor of his modest wood-frame house, he serves a dinner of hot tea and fresh sago pasta smothered in greens and peanut sauce.

“Delicious,” he says in English.

Later that evening, a small cargo ship pulls up to a nearby dock. A crew of roustabouts loads it with 15 tons of sago paste from Mr. Manan’s mill for dealers in Singapore, 70 miles across the Malacca Strait.

Sago, a staple for centuries in New Guinea and Borneo, is by far Indonesia’s most important paludiculture crop. Farmers – mostly small-timers such as Mr. Manan – produce about 50,000 tons of it a year, an amount that has tripled since 2013. In addition to being used to make sago pasta, it’s used in baked goods such as cookies and cakes.

“There’s potentially a huge market for it,” says Mr. Giesen, the Dutch consultant. He says that for paludiculture to gain widespread acceptance, more wetlands crops with proven markets must be demonstrated.

“You don’t want people too dependent on one or two products,” he says.

Five years ago, Mr. Giesen, a botanist by training, compiled a list of 1,500 plants with known uses that grow in Indonesia’s peatland forests. He winnowed this down to 80 plants that have or have had “major economic importance.” The short list includes the trees jelutong, a source of natural rubber; galam, which produces a medicinal oil in its leaves, flowers favored by honeybees, and sturdy construction timber; and tengkawang, which produces quantities of nuts containing cocoa-butter-like fat.

Any of these plants have potential to replace swaths of existing plantations of oil palm and acacia. But in most cases the existing market for their products is limited or nonexistent.

They’ll “need nurturing,” says Mr. Giesen.

For instance, food and cosmetic manufacturers already satisfied with cocoa butter would have to be induced to consider tengkawang nut butter. Natural chewing gum makers would have to be persuaded to replace Mexican chicle for jelutong's rubbery sap.

Moreover, Mr. Giesen’s plants haven’t undergone domestication that could increase their economic potential. Professor Joosten, who coined the term paludiculture in 1998, points out that the productivity of dryland crops such as corn has multiplied a thousandfold over the native species from which they emerged. Tractor combines, pesticides, storage containers, and shipping equipment have been engineered for decades or longer to lower the cost of bringing today’s top crops to market.

“The entire value chain has been optimized,” he says. In contrast, “We’re in the early Neolithic of paludiculture.”

On the front lines of the battle to rewet Indonesia’s peatlands is Hesti Tata, a forester who promotes paludiculture for the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. Like Ray Kinsella, who turns a corn field into a baseball diamond in “Field of Dreams,” it’s her job to tell family farmers that the if they plant wetland trees such as jelutong, demand will come.

It’s not always an easy sell. Farmers are not used to working soggy fields, and they fear there will be no buyer when the saplings she offers them mature. Sometimes Ms. Tata worries that her advice might lead them astray. The government might have to ban dryland farming on peatlands for paludiculture to take off, she says. Otherwise, “there will be no significant increase in Indonesia.” With so much of Indonesia’s peat going up in smoke each year and adding to global warming, we might all be worse off for it.

The National Union of Public Workers (NUPW) celebrated its 75th anniversary with a service at Collymore Rock Church of the Nazarene this morning.

Invited guest Colin Jordan, the Minister of Labour, said the union and the Barbados labour Party shared parallels in their desire to improve the lot of workers in Barbados and lauded the union for its theme “75 years of Consistent Representation and Growing with Technology”.

“I think it is appropriate that the NUPW, recognising that workers are the foundations of the building of a country, society and economic structure, also recognises that people . . . have to interact with technology. [Your theme] tells me the union recognises times are changing and even though people will remain the most important aspect of any country, it has to embrace the changes developing technology brings,” he said.

Union president, Akanni McDowall also said the theme was relevant as it challenged them to blend the old and the new and moved them not to rest on their laurels but to be on the forefront of re-educating the union’s membership in light of an ever changing working environment fuelled by technical advancement.

He then urged the members to take part in the upcoming activities while outlining his wishes going forward.

“It is my wish that prosperity is restored to the nation and we will endeavour to make our contribution, however small, to nation building. I wish we redouble our efforts in thought, word and deed to move our nation forever forward, onward and upward – inspired exalted, free,” he said.

The sermon was conducted by Pastor David Holder who warned the congregation not to forget God in good times or bad as this leads to a pointless life. He urged the congregation to then make a fresh commitment to God.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Garuda Indonesia has asked to cancel an order for 49 Boeing Co 737 MAX 8 jets, citing a loss of passenger trust following two crashes, although it had been reconsidering the order before the latest disaster in Ethiopia last week.

Garuda is the first airline to publicly confirm plans to scrap an order for the jets after the Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed 157 people. That accident came five months after a Lion Air 737 MAX crashed off Indonesia killing 189, and led to the grounding of the world's entire fleet of the aircraft.

""Many passengers told us they were afraid to get on a MAX 8,"" Garuda CEO Ari Askhara told Reuters on Friday.

An analyst, however, noted that Garuda had been looking at its fleet planning before the Ethiopian crash.

""This is an opportunity to make some changes that otherwise may be difficult to do,"" CAPA Centre for Aviation Chief Analyst Brendan Sobie said.

Analysts last week said the grounding of the 737 MAX fleet could give some airlines a good excuse to delay or cancel purchases, saving cash on their balance sheets.

Garuda could switch its order, valued at $6 billion at list prices, to other Boeing models, Chief Financial Officer Fuad Rizal said.

He said negotiations with Boeing were ongoing and Airbus SE jets were not under consideration.

The airline has only one 737 MAX in its fleet and its prior generation 737s remain relatively young. In 2017, the airline pushed back the rest of the deliveries to 2020 and beyond due to financial difficulties.

Askhara said last week it was possible it would cancel the order for 20 of the jets, with a final decision depending on what the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration does after the Ethiopian crash.

He told Reuters before the crash that the airline had decided to reduce the Boeing 737 MAX order from 49 by swapping some to widebody Boeing models. That could help it salvage deposits made on the 737 MAX planes.

Boeing declined to comment on customer discussions.

Indonesian rival Lion Air has been reconsidering its orders since its October crash.

""Climate change is worse than Voldemort"", read one student's handmade sign, referring to the evil wizard in the hugely popular Harry Potter books and films.

""I bet dinosaurs thought they had time too"", read another sign, as students and parents marched on parliament house in the capital Wellington.

Student protests were held in 30 towns and cities across New Zealand and are planned for capitals and cities across Australia, Europe and the United States later on Friday.

The marches are part of a worldwide student strike movement, which started in August 2018 when 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg began protesting outside her parliament on school days. Norwegian lawmakers have nominated her for the Nobel Peace Prize.

""The government just needs to change some things, which is why if we go on strike on a school day then they'll notice and they might actually do something about it,"" said 14-year-old New Zealand student Inese, who did not want her surname made public.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who has pledged NZ$100 million ($68 million) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, supports to the student strikes, saying teenagers should not wait until they were old enough to vote to use their voice.

Ardern's support of the students contrasts with politicians in Australia and Britain who have rebuked them for cutting class.

""For action on issues that they think is important, they should do that after school or on weekends,"" Australia's Minister for Education Dan Tehan told reporters ahead of protests in Melbourne.

Wellington parent Alex, who marched beside his 11-year-old son, disagreed. ""It's a much better day of education...this is the greatest issue of our time,"" he said.

Scientists say the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, releases greenhouse gases that trap heat and lift global temperatures, causing more floods, droughts, heatwaves and rising sea levels.

76,76,FF-2019-000029-IDN,$400k grants announced to help flood affected NW Qld producers - Beef Central,https://www.beefcentral.com/news/400k-grants-announced-to-help-flood-affected-nw-qld-producers/,"PRIMARY producers affected by last month’s devastating flood event in North Western Queensland will be able to access grants $400,000 under new assistance measures unveiled by Prime Minister Scott Morrison this morning.

Locally operated family holdings will have access to a maximum of $400,000 through two grant programs – one for restocking and replanting, and the other to replace on-farm infrastructure lost and damaged during the flood.

Farmers will contribute 50 per cent of the total cost, and the Morrison Government, through the grants, will provide the remainder up to $400,000.

Mr Morrison said the grants mean primary producers will have access to cash to start rebuilding their farm businesses when the time is right.

“This seed funding is about helping people get back on their feet faster,” he said.

“When I visited Cloncurry I met with families who have been on the land for generations, building up their herd. This is going to take years to recover from.

“We will keep working on this, there’s more to do,” the Prime Minister said.

The grants were initiated by the newly-established North Queensland Livestock Industry Recovery Agency, led by The Hon Shane Stone, AC QC.

“Shane has been on the ground meeting with primary producers in the Cloncurry and McKinlay shires. He came back to me with this practical assistance.

“The money needs to be made available as soon as possible. I understand these producers don’t have time to stuff around, we need to make this simple,” the Prime Minister said.

We will work with the Queensland Government to ensure the programs are administered through existing mechanisms to make it as easy as possible for farmers to access the funds.

Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, the Hon David Littleproud MP said without support, a significant part of Australia’s vital agricultural industry will struggle to recover.

“Many of the primary producers affected by these floods had also been dealing with years of drought. They’ve already shown great strength and resilience.”

Minister for Defence Industry, Emergency Management and North Queensland Recovery, Senator the Hon Linda Reynolds CSC, said these grants not only help primary producers to recover sooner, but stand to yield a significant benefit to local economies across a range of sectors.

“I have travelled throughout North Queensland to the hardest hit areas to speak with local mayors and graziers about what they need to get back on their feet,” Minister Reynolds said.

“Responding to this unprecedented disaster, which has decimated an industry that is vital to the survival of the local economy, demands a unique response.

“There is a lot more work to be done but this significant contribution is a critical first step for long term industry-wide recovery.”

Today’s announcement builds on the already almost $200 million in immediate assistance committed to people affected by extensive flooding in North and Far North Queensland earlier this year.

Package gives NQ industry hope and a helping hand

The dollar-for-dollar disaster recovery grants announced by the Federal Government will change the lives of thousands of cattle and sheep producers and offer hope to an industry suffering from a decade of disaster.

AgForce General President Georgie Somerset welcomed the grants of up to $400,000 per farm business as being “just what producers needed” to get the devastated North Queensland cattle industry back on its feet.

“Unprecedented natural disasters – drought then flood – have placed enormous strain on cattle producers and their families,” Mrs Somerset said.

“In the worst cases, producers have lost literally everything – livestock, fencing, machinery and homes – with the crippling cost of recovery in the millions of dollars.

“I can assure the Federal Government that its $300 million investment in the reconstruction of this hard-working and highly productive industry will be appreciated and well-used by farmers, in some cases turning their lives around.

“Graziers are a very proud bunch, so the fact that these grants are matched dollar for dollar means they are not a handout but a much-needed hand up.

“It also means that producers will not have to rely solely on increasing their farm debt to recover.”

The Federal Government grants are in addition to the State Government’s disaster loans of up to $250,000 at the concessional rate of 1.37% p.a. announced by Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk earlier this month.

AgForce‘s North Queensland Board Member, Longreach grazier Dominic Burden, said the flexibility of the grants made them so much more effective, providing hope and the ability to plan for the future, not simply replace what was lost.

“The grants can be used for restocking, replanting or replacing infrastructure and equipment, so it means that each farm business can make their own decision as how to best apply the grants to support their recovery,” Mr Burden said.

“And the fact that they can be used for costs already incurred is very welcome.”

Mrs Somerset praised both the Federal and State Governments for their long-term commitment to the reconstruction.

“We commend both levels of Government for working closely with AgForce and the local Councils from the earliest hours of the disaster to develop a comprehensive, long-term solution that will work,” she said.

“We primary producers are a resilient bunch, used to dealing with almost any adversity, but the devastating floods after years of drought have really knocked the industry around and it will take years if not decades to fully recover.

“There is no doubt that AgForce‘s role in helping Government understand the scale and implications of the disaster, and how assistance could best be delivered, is evident in the recovery measures that have been announced.

“AgForce is committed to ensuring producers have all the support they need for this to happen, and will continue to advocate for the industry and provide advice to the Government to ensure the best possible outcomes.”

AgForce has established a multi-disciplinary liaison committee chaired by Mr Burden that will feed information and advice directly to Shane Stone and the North Queensland Livestock Industry Recovery Agency (NQLIRA) to ensure valuable resources are most effectively and efficiently applied.

Fars Gov. Enayatollah Rahimi said a short but intense rainfall caused sudden flash flooding that inundated a main highway between Shiraz and Esfahan, trapping many travelers leaving the city. City officials did not have enough time to warn people in the area ahead of the deadly weather conditions.

The heavy storm system over the region delivered a month’s worth of rainfall in only a few hours, according to CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward. Coupled with the terrain in the area, this may have caused a funneling effect, which is not uncommon to see in some extreme flash flooding episodes. “With the arrival of new precipitation into the country, more than 13 provinces of the country are involved in severe rainfall, snow and blizzard in a way that 22 communications routes of the country have been completely blocked,” semi-official Mehr News Agency said. Emergency and rescue organizations are on full alert in Esfahan and Tehran as the heavy rain is predicted to continue to fall in much of the country, especially in southwest to central Iran. The storm will continue to impact Iran Monday night and into early Tuesday morning before the weather system begins to ease late Tuesday.

Andrei Zhestkov was detained late Friday at Bali's international airport after security officers found a 2-year-old endangered male orangutan sleeping in a rattan basket in his luggage.

Police showed the suspect along with the lizards and other evidence at a news conference Monday. Zhestkov, wearing an orange detainee uniform, refused to comment.

Local police chief Ruddi Setiawan said Zhestkov had confessed that he bought the orangutan for $3,000 from a street market on Indonesia's main island of Java. He said Zhestkov said he fed it allergy pills mixed with milk so it would lose consciousness for up to 10 hours on his planned flight back home to Vladivostok.

""We are still investigating his motive in attempting to smuggle the orangutan out of Indonesia,"" Setiawan said. ""We are also searching for the trader who sold the animals to the suspect.""

He said authorities found two geckos and four chameleons in his bags.

He said Zhestkov, if found guilty, faces up to five years in jail and $7,000 in fines for attempting to smuggle wildlife.

Orangutans are listed as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Only around 13,400 Sumatran orangutans remain in the wild.

It's a humid day, and through thick smog, the outlines of gray buildings are just about visible on the other side of the inlet.

In this part of Mumbai's mangrove forest, the land is barren, dotted with pools of dirty water and plastic waste.

""There's so much dirtiness,"" says 19-year-old college student Kajal Jadhab, as she looks around at the trash.

Scenes like this are common along Mumbai's shoreline. They were once covered in mangroves — coastal trees that act as vital flood defenses and carbon storage systems — but the forests have severely degraded, destroyed by encroaching housing developments and waste.

Read more: Bringing devastated mangroves back to life

Mumbai, India's second city, has lost around 40 percent of its mangrove forest cover in recent decades. Desolate areas like this are left behind, snapshots of the country's troubled relationship with the environment.

Waste can clog the roots of the mangrove trees, killing them and the habitat they provide for wildlife

But there are signs of change. Jadhab, armed with a trash bag and gloves, is a volunteer with Mission Mangroves, a project run by NGO United Way Mumbai.

Each month, volunteers in groups of around 20 take part in cleanup drives across Mumbai's wetlands, and about twice a week Mission Mangroves runs planting sessions to restore these forests. They plan to replant 100,000 mangrove trees, and in just over a year they've planted 55,000.

""The mission is to green 20 acres of wetland by planting mangroves, and to educate thousands of Mumbai people about the importance of mangroves,"" says Ajay Govale, United Way Mumbai's director of community impact.

Raising awareness

The air is stuffy under the mid-morning sun but the student volunteers, who are mostly in their late teens, get straight to work. They fill tens of trash bags with all kinds of waste — syringes, backpacks, shoes, even a motorcycle helmet.

It's Jadhab's first time volunteering here. ""I want to understand how I can help myself and other people to clean the sea. Not many people are aware of the issue, so we have to understand that, and how much the mangroves help us.""

""We don't want pollution in our city and in India, and doing little bits like this helps,"" says another student and first-timer, Shweta Waghe.

Discarded plastic bags, wrappers and bottles are a common sight on the beaches and streets of Mumbai. In fact, India is among the worst countries for mismanaging plastic waste. Much of this waste ends up in the wetlands, polluting, clogging and choking the roots of the mangrove trees surrounding the island city.

""The biggest threats [to mangroves] are developments and disposal of waste. A lot of this waste you see is not going to decompose for hundreds of years, and some of it will never decompose,"" says Govale.

Land is at a premium in growing Mumbai, and developments can spring up on important marshland and mangrove forest

Magic mangroves

It's a similar picture across the world. Between 30 to 50 percent of all global mangrove forest cover has been lost in the last half-century to agriculture, aquaculture, infrastructure development and waste, with knock-on effects for humans.

""Mangroves are the understated habitat heroes of the coast,"" says Jock Mackenzie, director of the MangroveWatch research group. ""Mangroves provide multiple ecosystem services that support, protect and enhance the economies and livelihoods of coastal communities.""

Mumbai is one of the worst cities in the world for air pollution — ranking 71st most polluted out of more than 3,000 cities with available air quality data — and is desperately lacking green space, like mangrove forests, to filter pollutants from the air. Mangroves can absorb up to four times more carbon than other tropical forests.

The loss of mangrove forests also means the loss of food, shelter and breeding grounds for an array of wildlife, from different crab species to cockles and prawns, which in turn affects local fishing communities reliant on the marine animals for food and livelihoods.

In 2005, Mumbai residents felt the full force of floodwaters after losing much of their vital mangrove flood defense system

Their disappearance as a natural bulwark against flooding and erosion also leaves coastal communities like Mumbai more vulnerable, as climate change causes sea levels to rise and extreme weather.

The consequences of the city losing almost 40 square kilometers of mangroves in the 1990s first became clear after disastrous floods in 2005 killed more than 1,000 people.

""This is what opened all our eyes after the floods of 2005. Mangroves were often considered to be wild bushes, no value to the environment, and with the floods hitting us we realized this is supposed to be a belt that protects the island city and maintains the balance between the land and the sea,"" says Govale.

Beefing up mangrove protection

After the flooding, Mumbai did take action to protect the forest. The local government formed a forest department ""mangrove cell,"" in charge of patrolling the land and deterring people from dumping waste in the wetlands. The remaining mangrove forests are now also protected from encroaching housing developments, an ongoing threat in the rapidly growing and densely populated city.

The presence of rangers has made a difference in stopping illegal construction and the dumping of waste, according to Govale. Last month, rangers caught a construction worker dumping 10 tons of debris — a crime now punishable by a large fine or even imprisonment.

Mission Mangrove volunteers believe they will feel the full effects of mangrove forest loss as climate change worsens

Still, despite the patrols and threat of fines, trash still finds its way to the beach. That's something Mission Mangroves hopes to tackle with its cleanups, by helping people realize that pollution and litter in the city impacts the health of the forests.

""A lot of waste will come back to the shore,"" says Govale ""We know it's not a lasting impact, but the lasting impact is what they, the volunteers, are going to carry.""

Volunteer Asmita Mestra has been left with a sense of urgency. The 19-year-old believes younger generations will be the ones to face the full environmental impacts of mangrove loss in years to come.

""Young people are going to be most affected from this pollution, and the loss of the mangroves, so we need to take action,"" says Mestra. ""This is our nature; this is protecting us so we should also protect it.""","Wed, 27 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/47986843_6.jpg,"['forest', 'mangrove', 'rising', 'mumbai', 'volunteers', 'waste', 'mumbais', 'buffer', 'loss', 'natural', 'saving', 'trees', 'city', 'mangroves', 'forests', 'tides']",

Linkedin News Desk (Agence France-Presse) Manila ● Sat, March 16, 2019 22:58 808 dcc1aefb9780f102b77c720ee8249221 2 SE Asia #Philippines,#Water,Manila,water-shortage,rain,infrastructure Free

Manila has been hit by its worst water shortage in years, leaving bucket-bearing families to wait hours to fill up from tanker trucks and some hospitals to turn away less urgent cases.

Taps are dry from four to 20 hours per day in the homes of about half of the Philippine capital's roughly 12 million people due to rolling outages driven by a dearth of rain and inadequate infrastructure.

""I have learned to take a bath using only seven pitchers of water,"" Ricardo Bergado told AFP as he lined up with his buckets. ""I even save the bath water to flush our toilet.""

The shortages started hitting late last week, with some areas in eastern Manila seeing the supplies of water into their homes being completely cut off.

However, Manila Water Company, one of the capital's two suppliers, said it will now use rolling cut offs spread across the city to share the pain more evenly.

Jerry cans and buckets were flying off store shelves and landing in lines where families were spending hours waiting for deliveries by truck.

""Instead of doing important things, our time is consumed now by making sure we have enough water,"" Bergado, a 57-year-old audio-technician told AFP.

At least five public hospitals in the capital have started getting supplemental supplies from water tankers, as shortages had led at least one to limit admissions.

""This is the worst (water shortage) we have experienced. It almost happened last year but we were saved by heavy rains brought by storms,"" Dittie Galang, Manila Water communications manager, told AFP.

The disruption could last until July when monsoon rains are typically in full swing and would replenish regional reservoirs, one of which is at a two-decade low.

Better known for flooding from its frequent typhoons, the Philippines is experiencing a dry spell that led to reserves being severely depleted.

At the same time, the ageing pipelines and dams that provide Manila's water have not kept pace with the growth of the mega-city, which has roughly doubled its population since 1985.

The government has admitted that the problem of growing demand for water has long been forecast but they failed to address it due to delays in projects that would expand capacity.

""We need an alternative water source and we need it yesterday,"" Patrick Ty, chief of Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, told ABS-CBN television.

Among the main projects in the pipeline is the construction of $355-million Kaliwa Dam, a Chinese-funded project that met resistance from indigenous peoples and church leaders for its feared effects on communities.","Sat, 16 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2019/03/16/2019_03_16_67822_1552751733._large.jpg,"['started', 'water', 'manilas', 'share', 'told', 'roughly', 'hours', 'millions', 'supplies', 'shortage', 'shortages', 'hit', 'worst']",

Or have to climb a fence to play?

After an observational, private audit of the condition of Sydney sports facilities, we found that these are the types of choices young people face. To engage more young people in sport, we need to create environments that are youth-centred in terms of quality and accessibility.

Our audit found the quality of almost all of the 26 parks in Sydney’s inner west was substandard.

Read more: Our 'sporting nation' is a myth, so how do we get youngsters back on the field?

Toilet blocks were usually dirty, if available for use at all. Most playing fields were grassy, but with patches of dirt, worn areas and uneven surfaces with no proper water drainage. In many cases, painted lines were badly worn or missing. Court surfaces were in similar disrepair.

But a recent survey of 1,100 people aged 9-17 from the same area suggests design factors related to access, rather than poor-quality facilities, are even greater barriers to sport participation.

Designing better accessibility

We usually think of access in terms of disabled and elderly community members. But urban, neighbourhood and park design affect accessibility for every demographic. Access related to the cost of sport has been well studied and recently addressed in New South Wales with the voucher program, but the design aspects are equally important.

These include: public transport options, location, range of sports, adaptability to weather, lighting and after-dark security, and provision for the sports young people want to play.

Our research confirms the importance of accessibility. Of the survey respondents who were active, 77% said they play at a neighbourhood park, with 72% reporting they walk there.

But 52.2% said they cannot play the sport they’d like in their local area. And 64% reported that where they play is not accessible for unstructured play.

The state of Sydney’s parks

Most public sport facilities in Sydney’s inner west are located in public parks. While greenery around these sports fields and courts makes the environment more attractive, it’s more costly to maintain sport facilities than green space. With limited funds available, councils must prioritise. Since everyone can enjoy the greenery, funds usually go there first.

Author provided , Author provided

Almost all the parks we audited were largely without fencing or other barriers, which means that, in theory, anyone can use them at any time. Yet many young people complained about fenced and locked facilities, and fields dominated by club programs.

And while our audit found park maintenance to be below standard, most of the young people surveyed didn’t think so: 70% reported the place where they play is clean; 64% said it is well maintained; and 67% said it is safe.

This discrepancy suggests a difference between objective measures of quality and people’s experience of a place.

Design issues

Both perceived quality of and access to the environment can affect physical activity, and our data suggest access is more important for young people.

Being close to residential areas and public transport are important design features. To maximise use, parks and sport facilities must be integrated into neighbourhoods, rather than placed on their edges.

But of the 26 parks we studied only five had adequate public transport access. Five had no public transport access whatsoever. Many were on the edge, rather than in the middle, of a residential neighbourhood.

Read more: Pay to play: is participating in sport becoming too expensive for everyday Australians?

Facilities also tend to accommodate only one or two sports. This may mean they’re being underused and not attracting families with children of different ages or different sport interests.

Another related design issue is the lack of facilities that accommodate the weather. There are very few artificial fields and too many fields sited on floodplains. Only a handful of sport areas are covered to allow for play in bad weather. This was reflected in our survey, as only 36% of young people said they can play sport in any weather.

Parks don’t accommodate free play

Around half of all respondents participated in highly structured coach-led practice at least twice a week and 67.5% engaged in unstructured play for the same amount of time. This shows our parks and green spaces need to be designed for both structured sport and unstructured free play. But designs for unstructured free play are usually directed at young children not adolescents.

And although the audit found footpaths and parking lots were generally well lit, few sports fields had adequate lighting for play at night. Giving teenagers in particular, who are burdened with homework and time constraints, the opportunity to play at almost any hour should increase use.

So what would an ideal sports facility look like?

It would be located in the middle of a neighbourhood with several bus lines and other public transport stops connecting there for better access. Many different sports would be available. It would include a cafe for parents to hang out in and a playground for children who are too young to play sport.

Most importantly, it would be well maintained and beautifully designed so that people would want to be there.

Or Jakarta's ""Bay of a Thousand Islands"" as it is known in English.

There aren't a thousand islands in the necklace of low-lying, tree-laden outlets of land in the bay. More like 300, stretching 45 kilometres north by fast ferry from Jakarta's Marina Ancol. Most are uninhabited and part of Jakarta's marine national park (who knew there was such a thing?).

Some are resort islands open to tourists and suit a range of budgets – a poor man's Maldives (especially those with over-water bungalows). Others, like Palau goo, are delightful water-fronted village islands, abundant with Indonesian life you won't see in Bali.

With a couple of days to spare after my first visit to Jakarta, I booked a weekend visit, via the internet, to Pramuka (palau means island, I later discovered). After an early morning A$20 taxi ride to the marina and a A$40 return ferry ride, I found myself on Pramuka: not the largest, most glamorous, or most beautiful of the Thousand Islands. But it is the commercial and administrative centre of Kepulauan Seribu, and the closest thing the Thousand Islands has to a town.

123RF Pramuka is best explored from the water or on foot.

A young man greets me at the wharf, puts my luggage into a trolley and escorts me the 100 metres to Seribu Resort. It's not what many travellers would call a resort – more a friendly backpacker's retreat overlooking the harbour. But it does have its own PADI-accredited dive school, hammocks and bean bags, a leafy courtyard and snorkelling from the private jetty. Masks and fins are free to guests and the hard coral is amazingly healthy and colourful.

As I set off for an evening meal I hear the haunting sound of mullahs calling villagers to evening prayer echo over the bay.

I dine at Nusa Resto, the island's celebrated ""floating restaurant"". Cynics might note Nusa Resto doesn't float. It's built, firmly, on stilts but the sunset is superb, framing a variety of boats crossing the bay between islands as my first course is served. Two female Norwegian backpackers in a neighbouring cabin at Seribu Resort recommend Nusa Resto: ""We've been there every day,"" they say. ""The food's delicious …as long as you love seafood.""

I order crab, sweetcorn and spring onion soup to start, followed by ""spicy grilled milkfish"" with steamed rice. To my initial frustration, the soup comes in a large communal bowl capable of feeding six. Two minutes later, the fish appeared.

123RF Pulau Bintang in Jakarta's ""Bay of a Thousand Islands"".

Milkfish (ikan bandeng) is popular throughout south-east Asia. It's also the only living version of the Chanidae fish family plentiful during the Cretaceous period. This deboned version is Cajun-blackened and coated in a red, piquant sauce grilled to the meaty flesh.

After two mouthfuls, my eyes are watering, my brow steaming, and I gulp down lashings of soup to cool my palette. It wasn't the milkfish's fault. I should never have gone for ""spicy"" in Indonesia.

Recovering the next morning, I decide to explore the island (though not with the same commitment the female German backpacker I shared breakfast with, travelling around Indonesia with her own gigantic paddle board). She's set off to paddle round Pramuka. It can't have taken her more than an hour because her paddle board was drying in the sun by the time I returned from my own little adventure.

Pramuka is best explored from the water or on foot. A street back from the waterfront, it reveals itself to be rows of neat, tidy, brightly coloured houses separated by schools, a soccer field and corner shops. Many of these houses offer ""home stay"", popular particularly among Indonesian visitors. On the other side of the island, the main attractions are a mangrove walk and the ""turtle beach"", a reserve set aside for loggerhead turtles. Six of the seven sea turtle species in the world are found in Indonesia (Kemp's Ridley is the one missing).

It's impressive just how many signs there are around Pramuka promoting the importance of looking after the turtles. Such a pity that the use of the plastic bag, so lethal to turtles, is ubiquitous.

Wilson: Air Force will rebuild flooded Offutt, make it 'even better than it was' - AirForceTimes.com",https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2019/03/25/sec-wilson-air-force-will-rebuild-flooded-offutt-make-it-even-better-than-it-was/,"Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson pledged to help Offutt Air Force Base recover from the devastating flood that swamped one-third of the Nebraska base during a visit there Friday.

“The United States Air Force will rebuild Offutt Air Force Base,” Wilson said. “We will work with the Nebraska congressional delegation to secure supplemental funds to be able to recover from the damage and make this base even better than it was.”

In a Saturday release, the Air Force said Wilson met with Offutt leaders and elected officials in the area — including Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., a retired Air Force brigadier general — during her visit to discuss rebuilding the base. Wilson said the Air Force is flying in resources to help the base assess its damage and begin reconstruction.

She applauded the leaders at the base, the home of the 55th Wing, for their preparations.

And she met with and praised some of the base personnel who prepared for the flooding, including a National Guardsman who spent 10 hours filling sandbags and the wife of an airman who worked at the Bennie Davis Maintenance Facility, who moved items from people’s offices to higher ground.

“There were no injuries, no loss of life on this base,” Wilson said. “All the aircraft were either flown out or moved to high ground. A lot of the ground equipment was saved because [base leadership] called in everybody in an all-hands effort.”

Tyndall and, now, Offutt’s recovery costs are creating an infrastructure cash crunch If supplemental funding for Tyndall and Offutt doesn't come through soon, the Air Force could have to dip into more operations and maintenance funds, possibly jeopardizing plans to fix deteriorating buildings across the force.

Wilson quoted Bruce McCauley, deputy director of the 55th Civil Engineer Squadron, who said, “Mother Nature can’t beat the 55th Wing.”

But the Air Force faces a considerable task ahead — and questions remain about how it will pay for it.

The Missouri River and Papio Creek’s flooding began overwhelming Offutt March 15, swamping 30 buildings and a large portion of the base’s flightline, and prompting the base to evacuate nine aircraft. Base personnel filled 235,000 sandbags in an unsuccessful attempt to try to hold back the waters.

The base last Wednesday began working its way through flood-damaged buildings as waters receded. But the base faces a lengthy recovery process.

The Air Force is also growing worried about the lack of supplemental funding to pay for natural disaster recoveries at hurricane-ravaged Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, and now Offutt. In a roundtable with reporters on Friday, John Henderson, the Air Force’s assistant secretary for installations, environment and industry, said the service may have to start using money from operations and maintenance funds to cover disaster recovery costs if supplemental funding doesn’t come through soon.","Mon, 25 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/cLfre6Cy_fmEw_p8gc76JePHBiU=/1200x630/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-mco.s3.amazonaws.com/public/543VAWBJOVBN3E2X3OLVJ365HU.jpg,"['wilson', 'sec', '55th', 'air', 'rebuild', 'flooded', 'base', 'recovery', 'better', 'force', 'supplemental', 'secretary', 'offutt', 'visit']", 
89,89,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Floods shut nearly a sixth of U.S. ethanol production - Fiji Times,https://www.fijitimes.com/floods-shut-nearly-a-sixth-of-u-s-ethanol-production/,"MEAD, Neb./NEW YORK (Reuters) – Massive flooding in the U.S. Midwest has knocked out roughly 13 percent of the country’s ethanol production capacity, as plants in Nebraska, Iowa and South Dakota have been forced to shut down or scale back production following the devastation.

Production facilities owned by large companies like Archer Daniels Midland Co and Green Plains Inc were still operating despite days of snowstorms followed by rains that sent record floods into the Farm Belt.

However, with rail lines are washed out, and corn in storage flooded, production is dropping off, sending prices spiking in markets that buy the corn-based fuel.

The U.S. has some 200 ethanol plants capable of producing 1.06 million barrels per day, and about 100,000 to 140,000 bpd of capacity has been taken off line due to the floods, according to three traders who track operations.

Crop damage exceeds $400 million in Nebraska alone, according to Nebraska officials.

The disruption comes as the ethanol industry is in the midst of a historic downswing due to the ongoing trade conflict with China and sluggish domestic demand growth that has led to high inventories and weak margins. The floods will boost margins for those still operating but could be punishing for firms digging out from the water.

Ethanol plants use rail cars to deliver products to the Gulf Coast, East Coast and West Coast markets. Ethanol delivered in the Gulf Coast is trading at 15 to 17 cents per gallon above Chicago’s benchmark price, about double the average gap for this time of year, traders said.

“It’s only to get worse. I think we are looking at a three to four week situation. Typically, exports would help fill the void, but we are being told that Brazil doesn’t have any excess supplies,” said one trader.

Among the plants that have scaled back are ADM’s plant in Columbus, Nebraska, the largest in the United States, due to flooding of a small rail line serving the plant, said Chris Cuddy, president of Carbohydrate Solutions at ADM.

The company said on Thursday that production is still limited without providing specific details, but traders said the plant’s production has been minimal. The plant can produce 413 million gallons annually, according to the Nebraska Energy Office.

“We haven’t been able to get (corn) to them for at least for a week because of the flooding and the roads washed out,” said Justin Mensik, 19, of Morse Bluff, Nebraska, who grows corn that supplies ADM’s Columbus plant.

In Arlington, Nebraska, a rail line was overrun by water, forcing its closure; contractors in the town said the line transports agricultural products like corn to other facilities. Roads to that line were also closed, and workers using diggers could be seen pulling out debris and using heavy rocks to fill holes.

“Transportation is definitely affected. All rail cars were put on hold since last Friday and they were not allowed to be sent out. We are not sure when it will be back to normal operations,” said Scott Tingelhoff, general manager at AltEn, an ethanol processor in Mead, Nebraska, which produces about 24 million gallons of ethanol a year.

Mike Jerke, chief executive of Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy LLC, which runs a 120 million-gallon-a-year ethanol production plant in Council Bluffs, on the border of Iowa and Nebraska, said he has had to cut production.

Corn farmers who provide feedstock are still digging out from the flooding, and some have already determined some of their supplies are unsuitable.

Omaha-based Green Plains, which has a market value of $700 million, said its five Nebraska plants are dry, but they are facing rail challenges around their Atkinson, Ord & Central City, Nebraska plants. The company is looking for ways to work around the flooding, such as unusual trucking routes, said company spokesman Jim Stark.

“It may take a couple of weeks to understand the total impact of the flooding,” Stark said.","Sun, 24 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.fijitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ethanol-plant.jpg,"['production', 'shut', 'floods', 'ethanol', 'corn', 'plants', 'rail', 'million', 'line', 'plant', 'nebraska', 'sixth', 'flooding', 'nearly']",

Oftentimes, they close due to the persistent complaints of dim-witted busybodies who bought McMansions in new subdivisions built close to formerly-secluded tracks. This might be the first time we've heard of a track closing due to environmental reasons.

The Missouri River has flooded, resulting in damage and destruction throughout the Midwest. In Iowa, Raceway Park of the Midlands, also known as I-29 Dragway, is currently under over ten feet of water – and has been for the past week or so.

I-29 Dragway is the home track of 1320Video, and they shared some very sad photos, ostensibly taken with a drone last Sunday, of the track in its current state on their Facebook page. For comparison, they also uploaded some photos of the track, which also includes a 2.23 mile road course, in happier times, to compare before and after. Since the photos were taken, the water level has gradually increased to a whopping 14 feet.

With so much of the timing equipment submerged, substantial repairs will likely be required when the flood waters eventually recede. The track surface, too, will also more than likely be damaged. While the track expects to be able clean up enough to host some cruise-ins and car shows this year, it's probably going to be quite a while – and quite a lot of work – before any more racing will take place.

Researchers warn of impending droughts and famines in flood-prone Assam linked to the overexploitation of usable groundwater stock by pumping for irrigation.

Estimates show rapid exhaustion of usable groundwater storage during the study period (2003-2015) in Assam, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal.

States with the highest groundwater depletion rates are subjected to water-intensive cropping practices during the study period.

Researchers warn of impending droughts and famines in flood-prone Assam, linked to the overexploitation of usable groundwater by irrigation-associated pumping.

A study that examined the status of the stock of groundwater available for extraction across the country revealed that Assam has lost the maximum amount of usable groundwater stock (between 2003 to 2015) in India.

“It is well-known that western India is living beyond its means when it comes to this resource. But our study shows that Assam and east India which were considered ‘water-affluent’ are experiencing loss in usable groundwater volume at a rate faster than it can be replenished,” lead researcher Abhijit Mukherjee of Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur told Mongabay-India.

The study combined borehole data from Central Ground Water Board, rainfall data and satellite data from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), a pair of satellites launched in 2002.

It showed Assam lost two percent of the groundwater stock (up to a maximum aquifer depth of 300 metres) that could have been used.

“Subsequently, many of these states are now intermittently getting affected by ‘groundwater drought’ in recent summers. Our prediction suggests that these summer groundwater droughts would intensify in recent future years, to become severe to very severe by 2050, with the possibility of spread over all seasons,” said Mukherjee in a statement.

Mukherjee, of IIT Kharagpur’s Applied Policy Advisory for Hydrogeoscience (APAH) Group, contends these groundwater droughts would accelerate the decline in food production and availability of drinking water, two of the prime goals under the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030.

Overall, the estimates show rapid exhaustion of usable groundwater storage during 2005-2013 in Assam, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. “In these areas, agricultural food production has been enhanced at the expense of a non-renewable loss in groundwater volume at an alarming rate,” said co-author Soumendra Bhanja.

In addition, the zones that exhibited maximum depletion of groundwater spanned across states located in the Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra basins that have water-bearing, highly fertile alluvial formations lending themselves to groundwater withdrawal for agriculture.

“In eastern India, we have seen a major shift in the last 10 years in terms of enhanced irrigation potential of areas. For Assam which had two crops a year, we are seeing three to four crops annually now,” said Mukherjee.

In states such as Assam, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, water-intensive crops such as rice, wheat, sugarcane, fruits and vegetables, cotton and soybean, take up the majority of the cropped area.

In fact, the cropped area associated with the two most water-intensive crops (rice and cotton) rapidly expanded during the study period, the researchers note.

“Rice and sugarcane are water-guzzlers. Even parched states like Haryana and Punjab are growing rice and both account for more than 60 percent of basmati exports from the country,” said Bhanja.

Vimal Mishra, associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar, who was not associated with the study, found the major findings from the IIT-Kharagpur study to be consistent with his team’s previous studies that show a depletion of groundwater in the majority of north India.

“The groundwater depletion in north India is the result of intensive pumping, long-term decline in precipitation, and decline in low-intensity rainy days. This is another study that reminds us that we need to do much more to ensure groundwater sustainability in India which is the key for food and fresh water security” Mishra told Mongabay-India.

Mishra and his team run and manage India’s real-time drought early-warning system. The latest data has revealed that 42 percent of India is facing drought with more than 16 percent under severe drought.

International non-government organisation WaterAid in its report released in March said global groundwater depletion has increased by 22 percent in the past decade, largely due to rising demand in India (23 percent), China (102 percent) and the United States (31 percent).

India is the third largest exporter of groundwater – 12 percent of the global total – and also uses the largest amount of groundwater – 24 percent of the global total. One billion people in the country live in water-scarce areas.

The report stressed food and crop exports, while important sources of income for most countries, contribute to this problem if production is not sustainable.

“Industrial and agricultural use of water should not be prioritised over people’s ability to get water daily for their basic needs,” the report said.

Increasing rainfall trend but groundwater depleting

Assam, the researchers said, is a study in contrasts. Trends point to increasing rainfall during the study period in the state while recording the “highest depletion potential” of usable groundwater storage (UGWS) in India, said Mukherjee.

During the study period, the net irrigated area (using tubewells) jumped from 9,000 hectares to 74,000 hectares in the state.

In a decade the state lost more than two percent of usable groundwater, said Mukherjee.

“But the excess water from the rainfall and floods does not get translated into groundwater because of the geology and the physics. If you think of mopping up a water spill with a sponge, then you would notice that initially, the sponge soaks up a lot of water but on subsequent use, it won’t take up any more water despite the fact that there is space inside,” pointed out Mukherjee.

A similar scenario is unfolding in Assam, he said.

“Once the top layer gets saturated, water does not trickle down to the subsurface for storage even though there is capacity for storage,” Mukherjee said.

Haryana, like Assam, showed a similar pattern: increase in precipitation but depletion in groundwater storage.

A climate projection for the period 2021-2050 highlighted in the Assam State Action Plan on Climate Change forecasts only the western part of the state will experience a slight decrease in rainfall but the rest of Assam is projected to have increased rainfall.

Assam and parts of east India are already saddled with problems of arsenic contamination of groundwater while parts of southern and western India battle the scourge of fluoride contamination. Salinity is a cause of concern in many parts of northwestern, western and southern India.

Despite the grim picture, the study also underscores the positives. For groundwater rejuvenation efforts, states like Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand show the highest potential.

“Because of the geology, these two states are highly receptive to groundwater restoration efforts. Overall, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh show a replenishing trend during the study period,” he said.

Mukherjee explained investigating estimates of usable groundwater storage across India could inform policy for budgeting water.

“Our estimates are conservative and close to reality. We could possibly do a pricing and budgeting mechanism and start allocating water for agriculture depending on the groundwater depletion potential,” he added.

""Climate change is worse than Voldemort,"" read a handmade sign carried by one student in Wellington, referring to the evil wizard in the hugely popular Harry Potter books and films.

""The oceans are rising, so are we,"" read another in Sydney.

In Europe, students packed streets and squares in Paris, Madrid, Rome, Brussels and other cities for ""Fridays for Future"" protests.

Demonstrations also took place across the United States. In Washington, some 1,500 students rallied in front of the Capitol chanting ""climate action now!"" and waving homemade placards with slogans such as ""Our planet, our future.""

The worldwide student strike movement started in August 2018, when 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg began protesting outside her parliament on school days. She has since been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.

On Friday, she spoke at a Stockholm demonstration. Other rallies were held in 100 towns around Sweden.

""We have only been born into this world, we are going to have to live with this crisis our whole lives. So will our children and grandchildren and coming generations,"" Thunberg said. ""We are not going to accept this. We are striking because we want a future and we are going to carry on.""

Thousands marched through central London with banners reading ""The future is in our hands"" and ""We're missing lessons to teach you one"".

""Education is important but climate change is more important,"" 14-year-old Molly Powell said.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tweeted his support on Friday evening. ""Young people can, and do, change the world,"" he said. ""You understand we are in a race for your lives; your commitment & activism makes me confident we will win it.""

""Climate catastrophe""

Scientists say fossil fuel use releases greenhouse gases that trap heat and lift global temperatures, bringing more floods, droughts, heatwaves and rising sea levels.

The 2015 Paris climate conference pledge to keep the increase in global average temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius (35 F) above pre-industrial levels requires a radical cutback in use of coal and fossil fuels.

In Düsseldorf, Germany, some 2,000 schoolchildren paraded with a carnival float depicting a giant effigy of Thunberg with ""Do something about the climate catastrophe at last"" written on her raised arms.

They stopped around the city, home to the headquarters of many of Germany's largest manufacturers, reading out calls for change. ""The clock is ticking and time is against us!"" they shouted. ""We are the last generation that can fix this.""

About 60 students protested at government house in Bangkok, holding cardboard signs to campaign against plastic. Thailand is one of the world's worst marine plastic polluters.

""As youths who will inherit the land, we gather here to demand that the government work with us to solve these problems,"" said 17-year-old Thiti Usanakul, of student-led group Grin Green International.

The group was later invited to meet officials at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment in two weeks.

There were also demonstrations in South Korea, India and South Africa. In Singapore, where strict laws regulate public assembly, young people planned a virtual campaign on social media.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern supported the strikes, saying teenagers should not wait for voting age to use their voices.

That contrasted with politicians in Australia and Britain, who rebuked them for missing lessons.

""For action on issues that they think is important, they should do that after school or on weekends,"" said Dan Tehan, Australia's education minister.

Wellington parent Alex, who marched beside his 11-year-old son, disagreed: ""It's a much better day of education.

But Offutt still has a long, hard road ahead — and it’s anybody’s guess how long the recovery effort will take.

Ryan Hansen, spokesman for the 55th Wing, said on Thursday the last waters flooding the 2-mile-long flightline at Offutt completely receded Wednesday. During the worst of the flooding, about 3,000 feet of the flightline’s east end was underwater.

Also on Wednesday, Hansen said civil engineers and bioenvironmental engineers made their way into the first of 30 flooded buildings — the Bennie L. Davis Maintenance Facility, the main hub of maintenance operations for the RC-135 Rivet Joint aircraft at the base.

The floodwaters — which were as high as 8 feet at the hardest-hit portions of the base — have gone down a foot or two in places, Hansen said.

Offutt’s flightline remains closed, however. Local civil engineers, as well as experts brought in from higher headquarters, are starting to look at the runway to make sure it is structurally sound, Hansen said. Engineers want to ensure water didn’t get under the flightline and cause hidden damage to its foundation, which could lead to problems such as dangerous sinkholes.

Floodwaters overwhelm one-third of Offutt; nine aircraft evacuated Only mission-essential personnel are working at the Nebraska base, which also hosts U.S. Strategic Command, and nine aircraft, including RC-135 Rivet Joint reconnaissance planes, have been evacuated.

Hansen said he hopes that before long, the flightline will again be open and aircraft can start to return. But he could not estimate when that might be. Five Rivet Joints flew to MacDill Air Force Base in Florida as the waters poured in, and three more flew to nearby Lincoln Air National Guard Base. Another airplane, an E-4B National Airborne Operations Center that belongs to Global Strike Command, also evacuated the base.

But waters have not entirely receded from the Davis maintenance facility, Hansen said, and as of Wednesday afternoon, a foot or two of water remained. The engineers are methodically working their way through the building to make sure it’s safe, before they can allow the people who work there to go back in and retrieve any salvageable work and personal items.

“It’s a good sign for sure” that engineers could re-enter the Davis building. “Every day we don’t get rain, and there’s no more water coming from the north, [the water] will continue to go down.""

Hansen said the Offutt community has pulled together in the wake of the disaster. About 1,300 personnel who previously worked in the now-flooded buildings are now working at other facilities around base, and people have been “bending over backwards” to support them as they get back on their feet.

The base said in a Wednesday release that its Airman and Family Readiness Center will set up an Emergency Family Assistance Center on Thursday and Friday to help about 20 Offutt personnel and their families, who were displaced from their flooded homes in the surrounding area.

Offutt’s RC-135s are continuing to train and generate sorties from their temporary home at the Lincoln base, Hansen said. One Rivet Joint conducted a training sortie Wednesday, and on its way back to Lincoln, flew over Offutt “to show how resilient we are,” Hansen said.","Thu, 21 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/1H8nqqoS5s98rmsH7pL6uaHMeb4=/1200x630/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-mco.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NGTJCMOH4ZDW3P6TQWES2UFNKA.JPG,"['water', 'flood', 'offutt', 'air', 'base', 'engineers', 'hansen', 'rivet', 'recovery', 'force', 'continues', 'waters', 'recede', 'flightline']",

CLARK COUNTY, Wash. – A Washington state teen has been sentenced to two days in jail after pushing her friend off a bridge into a river.

Tay’lor Smith, 19, was convicted of reckless endangerment on Wednesday in a Clark County court.

Judge Darvin J. Zimmerman also ordered her to serve for 38 days on a work crew and prohibited her from having contact with her friend for the next two years.

She will also be placed on supervised probation until she meets the requirements of her sentence, Zimmerman said.

She pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of reckless endangerment last week.

Video of Smith pushing 16-year-old Jordan Holgerson off the Moulton Falls Bridge last summer went viral. The footage shows Jordan flailing and screaming as she plunges about 60 feet into the East Fork Lewis River.

The fall broke four of Jordan’s ribs and damaged a lung. Doctors said the fall could have been fatal.

After Wednesday’s hearing, Smith broke into tears as a sheriff’s deputy placed her in handcuffs and escorted her out of the courtroom.","Wed, 27 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://fox40.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/03/court.jpg?w=1280,"['zimmerman', 'sentenced', 'bridge', 'placed', 'teen', '38', 'smith', 'days', 'endangerment', 'crew', 'jordan', 'fall', 'reckless', 'pushed', 'work', 'friend', 'jail', 'pushing']", 
96,96,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Subway first step in easing Indonesian capital's carmageddon – Borneo Bulletin Online - Borneo Bulletin Online,https://borneobulletin.com.bn/subway-first-step-in-easing-indonesian-capitals-carmageddon/,"JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Commuting in Indonesia’s gridlocked capital will for some involve less frustration, sweat and fumes when its first subway line opens later this month.

The line is the latest of infrastructure improvements nationwide that officials hope will help the giant but laggard nation catch up with its neighbours.

The 16-kilometre system running south from Jakarta’s downtown is the first phase of a development that if fully realised will plant a cross-shaped network of stations on the teeming city of 30 million people. A USD2.4 billion elevated rail network linking Jakarta and its satellite cities is also taking shape, with the first stage expected to begin operating in April.

Congestion has relentlessly worsened in the past decade as car ownership rose, squeezing more and more vehicles onto Jakarta’s unchanging road network. Average peak hour speed has “significantly decreased” to 10 kilometres an hour, according to the transport ministry. It often can take two or more hours to move five kilometres in pockets of the city.

Annual losses from congestion are forecast to reach USD6.5 billion by next year. Without better public transport an even greater carmageddon is facing Jakarta as rising incomes transform the owners of its 18 million motorbikes into car owners.

But it likely will take several years for mass rapid transit to make a dent in the congestion. About 1.4 million people commute into central Jakarta on work days. The initial subway line aims to carry only about 130,000 people a day by the end of this year.

“We need more lines, continuing to the north, we need the east-west line, we need the loop line. By that time we can be talking about a significant impact of this metro to the traffic congestion of Jakarta,” MRT Jakarta president William Sabandar said in an interview.

“But this is great momentum already. What I’m expecting now is that this can be the momentum to promote the use of public transport in Jakarta,” he said.

He said the subway to the north of the city should start operating in 2024 and the east to west line could be ready by 2026 if work begins next year as planned.

The city’s middle classes look with envy at the clean efficiency of cities like Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and Singapore or the rapidly expanding commuter rail network in Bangkok and are keen to see progress on transport.

Jakarta also faces far more fundamental problems that are only slowly being addressed.

Prone to flooding and rapidly sinking due to uncontrolled ground water extraction, Jakarta is the archetypical Asian mega-city groaning under the weight of its dysfunction.

Middle class office workers live in upmarket oasis neighbourhoods that strive to become Jakarta’s centre but ultimately add to its problems.

Behind the modern facade of gleaming office towers that line the major thoroughfare, revamped for last year’s Asian Games, are tightly packed neighbourhoods that lack sewage or waste water treatment.

Only four per cent of Jakarta’s waste water is treated, according to the government, causing massive pollution to rivers and contaminating the ground water that supplies that city.","Tue, 19 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/page-14-a-16p3_190319.jpg,"['easing', 'water', 'network', 'indonesian', 'congestion', 'step', 'jakarta', 'million', 'line', 'need', 'transport', 'capitals', 'jakartas', 'subway', 'carmageddon']", 
97,97,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Rohingya reject relocation to Bangladesh's island 'prison camp' - DW (English),https://www.dw.com/en/rohingya-reject-relocation-to-bangladeshs-island-prison-camp/a-47933027,"Bhashan Char is a small, sediment island that is vulnerable to flooding and cyclones. On Wednesday, Bangladeshi authorities said they would begin relocating Rohingya refugees to buildings that they have constructed on the island. The UN, rights activists and the refugees have all expressed opposition to the plan.

In early 2018, Bangladesh began constructing roads, shelters and floodwalls on the island, and it has spent an estimated $280 million (€247 million) completing the project.

Bhashan Char, which means ""floating island,"" started to form in the Bay of Bengal 20 years ago from sediment building up at the mouth of the Meghna River. Map analysis shows the island is covered with tidal channels, which indicate that it floods during monsoon season.

Bangladesh plans to shelter around 100,000 Rohingya in 1,440 buildings it has built on the island.

Nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees currently live in overcrowded camps in Cox's Bazar on Bangladesh's border with Myanmar. Mozammel Huq, a senior Bangladeshi government minister, said on Wednesday that construction was complete and that the relocations would start next month.

Rohingya in Bangladesh resist repatriation attempt One million people live in Bangladesh refugee camps More than a million Rohingya Muslims live in refugee camps in the Cox's Bazar district of Bangladesh. The poor South Asian country has struggled to deal with the humanitarian crisis, and living conditions in the refugee camps are dire. UN agencies say they have received only a fraction of the billions of dollars of aid money needed to run their operations in the area.

Rohingya in Bangladesh resist repatriation attempt Rohingya protests blocked Bangladesh repatriation efforts 150 Rohingya Muslims were meant to be repatriated to Myanmar on Thursday, but protests put a stop to the operation. Hundreds of people chanted ""we will not go"" at a demonstration near the Myanmar border, and Bangladeshi authorities acknowledged that none of the refugees who were meant to be repatriated showed up or wanted to return.

Rohingya in Bangladesh resist repatriation attempt UN and human rights groups critical of repatriation Bangladesh had agreed with Myanmar to repatriate a total of more than 2,200 people, including Sitara Begum and her son Mohammed. The move has been criticized by the United Nations and aid groups. UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said sending the refugees back would be like ""throwing them back to the cycle of human rights violations that this community has been suffering for decades.""

Rohingya in Bangladesh resist repatriation attempt Rohingyas report fleeing killings, destruction and rape More than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims who fled army-led violence in Myanmar, mainly in the second half of 2017, are living in Bangladesh. The Rohingya refugees claim Myanmar soldiers and Buddhist civilians massacred families, destroyed villages and carried out gang rapes. UN investigators have accused the army of ""genocidal intent.""

Is Bhashan Char habitable?

Bangladesh's coastal region is vulnerable to cyclones. Hundreds of thousands of people have died over the past 50 years from storms and flooding. On Bhashan Char, a 13-kilometer (8-mile) long flood defense embankment surrounds the refugee barracks, and officials say it will stop tidal surges if a cyclone hits.

However, a top UN rights expert visited the island and said she wasn't convinced it is ""truly habitable.""

""Ill-planned relocations without the consent of the refugees have the potential to create a new crisis,"" said Yanghee Lee, UN special rapporteur on Myanmar, who visited the island in January.

Shahed Shafiq, a local journalist who visited Bhashan Char a few months ago, says that the island is far from habitable. He points out that even during a normal high tide, most parts of the island are submerged.

""The island is uneven and even newly constructed roads go under water during high tide,"" he told DW. ""Any cyclone could wash away the island easily.""

Shafiq also pointed out that the island is located in the Bay of Bengal far away from the mainland. ""It takes more than three hours to reach the island by a trawler, and the sea is often rough, which makes the journey risky,"" he added.

Rohingya reject the plan

Many Rohingya do not want to relocate to the island and activists fear that that the government may force them.

""Ever since the relocation plan was unveiled, many refugees have shown their unwillingness to move there,"" Nay San Lwin, a Rohingya activist based in Germany, told DW. ""If anyone is moved there, it would be by force,"" he added.

""I have spoken with many representatives of the refugees and no one has shown interest. They want to stay where they are until they can go back to their homeland with protection and full rights,"" Lwin said.

Ansarullah Arman, a Rohingya refugee at the Nayapara camp in Cox's Bazar, told DW that the authorities at the camp have asked if any refugees are willing to relocate to Bhashan Char.

""Everyone has refused to move there from our camp,"" he said. ""We will protest if they force us to move to the island.""

Anything is better than Myanmar?

Nurul Islam, a Rohingya representative at the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, said that some refugees, despite the poor conditions, may accept the offer to move to the island rather than return to Myanmar.

""We don't want to return to Myanmar without having citizenship,"" he said. ""We were forced to leave the country because they brutally tortured us, killed our relatives and raped our women. We would prefer an island life instead of returning to Myanmar without any security.""

Around 730,000 Rohingya refugees have fled Myanmar since 2017 to escape what the UN has referred to as a ""textbook case of genocide."" The refugees are crammed into the world's largest refugee camp in countryside surrounding Cox's Bazar. Aid groups say they are at risk of landslides, disease and floods. Bangladeshi authorities say relocating some of those refugees to the island will reduce pressure on the existing camp.

But despite the untenable situation at Cox's Bazar, activist Nay San Lwin said that the compound built on Bhashan Char was a ""prison camp"" for refugees because of its remote location. For Lwin, keeping Rohingya refugees near the Bangladesh-Myanmar border would be a better option.

""The Bangladesh-Myanmar border stretches 270 kilometers (170 miles). I believe there are many areas along the border where shelters can be built for Myanmar's genocide survivors,"" he said.

However, despite all of the warnings and reluctance from Rohingya, Bangladesh seems ready to go ahead with the plan.

""It's up to Bangladesh to decide where we will keep the refugees,"" said senior government minister Mozammel Huq.","Fri, 15 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/47897422_6.jpg,"['bangladeshs', 'char', 'relocation', 'island', 'rohingya', 'reject', 'coxs', 'refugee', 'myanmar', 'camp', 'repatriation', 'bangladesh', 'refugees', 'prison']", 
98,98,FF-2019-000029-IDN,Indonesian Environmentalists Seek Meeting with Chinese Bank over Sumatra Dam Project - Radio Free Asia (RFA),https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/indonesia-dam-03202019170228.html,"An activist in an orangutan costume takes part in a protest outside the Chinese consulate in Medan, Indonesia, against the construction of a dam that environmentalists fear will damage the habitat of an endangered orangutan species, March 1, 2019.

Indonesia’s leading environmental group said Wednesday it was seeking a meeting with Bank of China representatives to discuss a Chinese-funded dam project in North Sumatra province that, activists and scientists warn, could threaten the world’s rarest orangutan species.

The Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi) asked for the meeting after officials from the bank, which is financing the U.S. $1.6 billion hydropower project, announced they would evaluate it in response to concerns raised by conservationists.

The bank’s move was encouraging but direct talks were critical for reaching a common understanding of the issue, said Dana Tarigan, Walhi’s executive director for North Sumatra.

“Many of the environmental, social and biodiversity risks are fairly complex, and so we hope a meeting can help clarify and dispel common misconceptions regarding the dam’s real impacts,” Dana told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service.

PT North Sumatra Hydro Energy (NSHE), an independent power producer in which China’s ZheFu Holding Group owns a majority stake, is building the 510-megawatt hydropower dam in the Batang Toru rainforest on Sumatra Island.

The plant will divide the habitat of about 800 Tapanuli orangutan and increase the risk of their extinction, environmental groups and scientists have said.

The Batang Toru Ecosystem is the only known home to the Tapanuli orangutan, which was discovered in 1939. It has been identified as a distinct species, and was recently listed as a critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

PT North Sumatra Hydro Energy denied that the project would threaten protected animals.

Dana said Bank of China had sent an email to Walhi last year promising to investigate the concerns raised by environmentalists, but the bank had never informed the group of the findings.

“We hope that we will get firm answers, not just normative platitudes from officials of the Bank of China,” he said.

“We appreciate the statement, but it’s meaningless if construction is going ahead,” he added.

Construction would destroy some of the most critical low-altitude habitats of the orangutans, cutting the connection between the eastern and western block of the habitat, according to Erik Meijaard. He directs the conservation program at Borneo Futures and is a professor at the Center of Excellence for Environmental Decisions at the University of Queensland in Australia.

Bank of China could not be immediately reached for comment. But a statement on its website that was posted on March 4 said officials had taken “note of the concerns expressed by some environmental organizations about the hydroelectric dam project.”

“We attach great importance to corporate social responsibility in our global operations and ensure that our business activities abide by local laws and regulations. We are committed to supporting environmental protection globally and upholding the principles of green finance,” the bank said.

“Bank of China will evaluate the project very carefully and make prudent decisions by duly considering the promotion of green finance, the fulfilment of social responsibility as well as the adherence to commercial principles,” the statement went on to say.

Project expected to be finished in 2022

Part of Beijing’s One Belt, One Road (OBOR) plan, the project in the Sumatra rainforest underscores how China’s global infrastructure drive can threaten the environment, said Bill Laurance, director of the Center for Tropical Environmental and Sustainability Science at James Cook University, which is also in Queensland.

The director general for electricity at Indonesia’s Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry, Rida Mulyana, said the project was on track to be completed by 2022, local media reported over the weekend.

The project has attracted criticism from environmentalists worldwide, as China’s aims to link Beijing with Asia, Europe and Africa by building massive highways, railways, ports and other infrastructure under OBOR.

The Alliance of Leading Environmental Researchers and Thinkers (ALERT), led by Laurance, sent a letter to Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo last year, urging him to stop dam-related development in the orangutan habitat.

Earlier this month, a provincial administrative court in North Sumatra rejected a petition filed by Walhi demanding that the permit for the project be revoked. The court ruled that construction could proceed.

NSHE said the plant would cover an area of 122 hectares (301 acres), or only 0.07 percent of the Batang Toru ecosystem.



Only a small part of the project area is in the home range of up to seven orangutans, it said.



The project is backed by the China Export & Credit Insurance Corp., also known as Sinosure, a major Chinese state-owned enterprise, and the Bank of China. Beijing-based engineering firm Sinohydro hydropower has been awarded the contract to build the dam.



The hydropower plant is one of the priority projects under the Jokowi government’s drive to upgrade the country’s infrastructure. Jokowi is up for reelection in mid-April.



The hydropower plant is not the only China-funded project that has triggered controversy in Indonesia.

Greenpeace blamed the Celukan Bawang coal-fired power station in Bali, a U.S. $700 million project built by China Huadian Corp., for “poisoning” the island that is a top tourist destination in the country.



In August, a court threw out a lawsuit brought by Greenpeace and local people against Bali’s governor and the company, ruling that the local government’s decision to issue a permit for the project was lawful.
