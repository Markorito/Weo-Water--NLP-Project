0,0,FL-2017-000084-IND,Why Assam faces floods every year - Livemint,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/JEGERRSFHOVCAm86Pd1tnL/Why-Assam-faces-floods-every-year.html,"New Delhi: Year after year, the biggest state in the northeastern region, Assam, is ravaged by floods. It displaces thousands and damages property worth billions—but lessons are rarely learnt.

While natural topography and excessive rainfall are obvious causes, floods are also caused by human intervention—like encroachment of river banks and wetlands, lack of drainage, unplanned urban growth, hill cutting and deforestation.

The Brahmaputra, a trans-boundary river and among the mightiest rivers in Asia, is braided and unstable in its entire reach in Assam except for a few places.

As per the Brahmaputra board’s latest annual report, the main reasons behind the instability of the river are high sedimentation and steep slopes. Additionally, the entire area falls in an earthquake-prone zone and experiences high rainfall.

The Brahmaputra board is a central government body that is tasked to carry out surveys and investigations in the Brahmaputra Valley and to prepare a master plan for the control of floods, bank erosion and improvement of drainage.

“Topography of Assam and meteorological factor (high rainfall) are the obvious reason behind Assam floods every year. Also, Brahmaputra is the largest water carrying river of India and the second-largest silt carrying river in the world. But the way we deal with rivers is further accentuating the disaster faced by the region,"" said Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP).

SANDRP is a network of organizations and individuals working on issues related to the water sector with a focus on large dams.

“The dams that are being built are further creating disasters. Not just that, the wetlands forests and local water bodies are being systematically destroyed which in turn is adding to the disaster vulnerability of the area,"" Thakkar added.

The region is also extremely vulnerable to breaches of embankments.

“Floods happen due to a breach of embankments. More than 80% of these embankments have not been reinforced in several decades because there is a huge contractor-administration nexus that benefits monetarily from a flood situation,"" said Kishalay Bhattacharjee, professor and commentator on the northeastern region.

According to data released by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), 2017 has been the worst of the last four years in terms of floods.

In 2014, due to floods, 1,846 villages were affected and about 1.6 million people were displaced. In 2015, the number of affected villages was 1,031 and about 1.5 million people were displaced. The numbers saw a huge jump in 2016 with 2,893 villages affected and about 1.7 million people being displaced.

This year, about 2,450 villages have been already affected by floods and more than 1.7 million people across the districts of Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Karimganj, Kokrajhar, among others, displaced. The monsoon season is still ongoing.

ASDMA has set up 123 relief camps and 259 relief distribution centres across the state but the number of displaced is increasing. The camps are housing close to 29,000 refugees. The current death toll across 58 districts in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Manipur is 80.

Thakkar said authorities also need to improve the flood forecasting system and coordinate with local administrations.

“The central water commission (CWC) puts out flood forecasts but that’s not good enough as local administration is not able to use it. CWC also needs to take it into account rainfall data and not just upstream water flow. All such measures along with addressing man made causes can help reduce the level disaster in the region,"" he added.

Floods also are a cause of worry for the administration as they spread disease.

“Japanese Encephalitis has already spread here. We fear that other water-borne diseases such as jaundice and cholera will also affect the refugee camps because there are too many displaced people and the situation is only becoming worse with each passing day,"" said a senior union home ministry official, requesting anonymity.

A team from Niti Aayog and the union home ministry’s National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), led by union minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju, carried out a ground assessment of the Assam floods earlier this week. The government has also drafted in experts from Isro for carrying out an assessment of the damage in the northeast by satellite.

1,1,FL-2017-000084-IND,How we define Assam’s flood problem - The Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/assam-flood-problem-brahmaputra-4813712/,"During this year’s floods, the media has paid attention to the large number of animals — including rhinos and lesser known endangered species like hog deer and sambar deer — that have tragically perished (Illustration: C R Sasikumar) During this year’s floods, the media has paid attention to the large number of animals — including rhinos and lesser known endangered species like hog deer and sambar deer — that have tragically perished (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)

“If I were given one hour to save the planet,” Albert Einstein once said, “I would spend 59 minutes defining the problem and one minute resolving it.” I am often reminded of this statement when considering Assam’s annual encounter with floods. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has recently announced that he would appoint a high-powered committee to find “a permanent solution” for Assam’s recurring flood problem. Einstein’s words will be highly relevant to this task. Much of the defining of the problem will have to happen before this committee is formed; its composition will reflect how the government chooses to define the problem.

Floods have not always been a “problem” for Assam. For centuries, the region has relied on the annual flooding and recession of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries for the productivity of its agriculture and other non-farm activities that sustain rural livelihoods. Following a visit to Assam in 1921, M.K. Gandhi spoke of the “relatively happy” lives of the Assamese. “Their land does not require much cultivation,” he observed.

“The flood waters of the rivers fertilise it, so that the people are able to earn their livelihood with little labour.” Even today, the pervasive sight during the monsoons of bamboo fishing nets and traps fixed on water bodies and submerged agricultural lands makes even the casual visitor aware of the significant role that floods play in rural livelihoods.

During this year’s floods, the media has paid attention to the large number of animals — including rhinos and lesser known endangered species like hog deer and sambar deer — that have tragically perished. But without Kaziranga’s annual rejuvenation by floods when the park is closed to tourists, the landscape and its unique wildlife will not survive. No remedy can put at risk the integrity of the dynamic system that connects the Brahmaputra with its alluvial floodplains where Kaziranga is located, and which explains its unique biodiversity.

Floods are events of nature. But they are not “natural disasters”. Whether a natural event becomes a disaster depends on when and where it occurs. Floods affect the natural and built environments differently. The same flood event can be damaging in a heavily built environment but a boon in a natural environment.

In Assam, the perception of floods as a “problem” is a 20th century phenomenon. British colonial administrators did not think of protection against floods in the 19th century. But they were beginning to eye the low-lying areas of the floodplains of the Brahmaputra as a significant source of potential revenue: As “wastelands”, the vocabulary they used to give away large tracts of land to European tea planters. But unlike those lands, these so-called “wastelands” close to the river were not suited for growing tea.

The idea of flood protection appeared on the policy agenda for the first time in the late 1920s and 1930s when floods began to cause damage to the thriving new crop of jute in those low-lying areas. We know from the work of environmental historians that the peasantry in Assam before the 20th century had settled and cultivated lands in the floodplain away from the riverbed. The lowlands close to the river were used for seasonal cultivation.

It was the demand for new lands to meet the growing requirements of Bengal’s jute industry that led to the policy of settling those lowlands with migrants from east Bengal. The rapid rise of jute production in the early part of the last century coincides with the reclamation of those areas for year-round settlement and the first wave of migration of east Bengali peasants to Assam: The forefathers of today’s Assamese-speaking Miya Musalman community. Flood control appeared on the policy agenda only after the jute crop in the riverine tracts became “flood-prone”.

The Assam earthquake of 1950 raised the bed of the Brahmaputra, and floods began to threaten the built environment of commercially important cities like Dibrugarh and Jorhat. That was the spur behind flood control in the post-colonial period. Building embankments to protect those urban settlements now became a policy priority.

The Assam Embankment and Drainage Act that enables the building and maintenance of embankments “for the purpose of excluding, regulating and retaining water” was adopted by the state assembly in 1953. Assam has since built nearly 5,000 kilometres of flood control embankments, the third most extensive in the country. But while embankments were initially able to protect targeted settlements, they have had many unintended consequences.

The confinement of the river flow because of the embankments has led to higher water levels and increased hydraulic pressure during the monsoon, threatening bank erosion and embankment failures. Embankment breaches are now the major cause of flood devastation in Assam. In some parts of the state, embankments affect areas enclosed by an embankment and those outside very differently, adversely impacting the livelihoods of poorer communities and reinforcing social inequalities.

Public policy-making at its best is “a form of collective puzzlement on society’s behalf; it entails both deciding and knowing”. Solving Assam’s “flood problem” will be a complex balancing act. In order to define the problem satisfactorily, one must carefully consider the history of Assam’s complex encounter with floods.

There are two radically different ways of thinking about floods. Let me put them schematically. Physical scientists have traditionally viewed rivers as carriers of volumes of water and sediment that need to be harnessed by science in the interest of human progress. Floods, in their view, are destructive natural hazards that inflict property damage and human suffering. Few contemporary physical scientists, however, will take that view. For ecologists on the other hand, floods are not disasters. They are key to the health of riverine ecosystems; they benefit both people and wildlife. For many in contemporary Assam, dependence on the river ecosystem is not just a theoretical idea; it is lived reality. Many grassroots activists give voice to their struggles without the ecologist’s vocabulary.

At this point of our history when climate change challenges many of the key assumptions behind past economic policy, both perspectives demand consideration. It will be prudent to define the problem carefully before rushing to find a “permanent solution”. That will be in keeping with Einstein’s wise words on how to go about solving problems.","Sat, 26 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/floods-7591.jpg,"['water', 'deer', 'flood', 'embankments', 'problem', 'floods', 'assam', 'policy', 'define', 'assams', 'natural', 'river']",

They are cutting bamboos, fixing posts and ceiling, and placing wooden logs to bridge the area with the road that has developed major cracks since last Sunday night when the red river turned furious, washing away a number of roadside shops, restaurants and houses.The road that connects Assam’s North Lakhimpur town with Arunachal Pradesh’s Ziro is now shut for maintenance, and traffic is diverted through a detour.""We helplessly watched as strong currents washed away everything that we had — from utensils to our livelihood,"" says Hari Lal. ""Our lives will never be the same again.”Somen Choudhury, who runs a stationery shop near Hari Lal’s dhaba, describes the fury: ""I did not get even 10 minutes to take out all my belongings. And even if I could, where could I have kept those? The water was all over the road. NEEPCO’s decision to release water without any warning was disastrous for us”.NEEPCO or the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation, a government-run company that runs a 405 MW hydel project in Arunachal Pradesh, has become the most hated acronym in North Lakhimpur town. The flood victims of the area, who this writer had interacted with, seemed more upset with the public sector undertaking than the district administration which, as many families said, provided relief material only on the fourth day — and that too ""a mere 600 grams of rice”.On the day the town got flooded, the government’s rescue teams did arrive, the villagers concede. The elders were given a helping hand and many people in the area spent the night either on National Highway 15 or on the Ziro road. The administration decided to shut down the highway for 12 hours as the flood situation exacerbated. One of the two parallel bridges over the Ranganadi was damaged and is still shut for traffic, as repairs and retrofitting work continue. Two nearby embankments were also breached, resulting in massive inundation across villages and low-lying areas.Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal , who had earlier represented Lakhimpur Lok Sabha constituency, concedes that NEEPCO had a role in the Ranganadi’s havoc. He, however, does not see the release of excess water as an unusual move. ""The district administration has confirmed that NEEPCO released a large volume of water from the dam. It’s a normal practice that excess water is released at times. The district administration is in touch with NEEPCO. The situation has improved. North Lakhimpur is very much safe,"" Sonowal told ET Magazine.Floods in Assam are an annual ritual and the government of the day can’t do much beyond setting up makeshift camps, distributing relief material and repairing breaches in roads, bridges and embankments. But when it is an above-normal flood situation, as it is this year — 52 deaths, 17 lakh affected people in 25 districts with 25,000 in relief camps — routine interventions cease to be productive.Then, there are the usual optics — which are perhaps necessary to manage perceptions — that follow a deluge and its trail of destruction. During earlier flood seasons, it was customary practice for the prime minister of the day to make helicopter rounds of flood-hit areas, assuage apprehensions and promise relief packages. The Sonowal government has faced major flak as no heavyweight Central minister visited the flood-affected families in the crucial second week of July.MoS for Home Kiren Rijiju’s visit to North Lakhimpur and Majuli and parts of his home state Arunachal Pradesh on Thursday failed to make any impression as he’s not only a junior minister but belongs to the region itself. The opposition Congress has already upped the ante by criticising the Centre’s apathy towards the flood victims. ""When there were floods in Tamil Nadu in 2015, the Centre granted Rs 1,000 crore. For cleaning the Ganga, Rs 20,000 crore is earmarked for five years. What has the Centre given to Assam to tackle floods?"" asks Gaurav Gogoi, Congress spokesman and Lok Sabha MP from Assam.Last week, Gogoi wrote a letter to the PM, questioning the Centre’s revision of the funding pattern of flood management schemes between the Centre and the state from 90:10 to 80:20, based on the recommendations of government think tank NITI Aayog. Thus, for a flood management scheme under the Central Water Commission, the Assam government now needs to contribute a matching grant of Rs 20 for a project worth Rs 100 unlike just Rs 10 in the past. ""NITI Aayog has played a very negative role as far as flood management in Assam is concerned,"" Gogoi told ET Magazine.The state government, however, claims that funds are not an issue at all, as each of the deputy commissioners at the helm of flood-affected districts is given adequate resources for relief, rehabilitation and repair work for breaches in roads and embankments on an urgent basis. The state government officials also add that scarcity of funds has not stopped any flood-related, long-term project.Amid allegations and clarifications, here’s a bigger question: how does Assam survive the annual wrath of floods that cost the state at least Rs 128 crore every year, if damage to crops, houses and public utilities is taken into account.This figure is calculated on an average between 1953 and 2016 for which data is available, with a rider by the Central Water Commission that the figures between 2013 and 2016 are provisional. A damage of Rs 3,200 crore in 2012 was the highest for a single year since data on floods had begun to be compiled. Also, the annual average flood-related deaths in the same period for Assam is 47, with the loss of lives at 497 in 2004 being the highest.These statistics prepared by the Central Water Commission are considered conservative as many flood-related deaths and damages go unreported. If national data is analysed, the floods in 1977 that resulted in 11,316 deaths were the worst ever.The BJP government of Assam, which was installed last year with a two-thirds majority after dislodging a 15-year-long Congress regime, is now banking on a Rs 40,000 crore proposed dredging project from Sadiya to Dhubri — the entire 891 km stretch of the Assam portion of the Brahmaputra so as to increase its water-carrying capacity, thereby minimising floods. The river originates in China as the Yarlung Tsangpo and meanders 3,848 km in China, India and Bangladesh before falling into the Bay of Bengal.Can dredging in the Assam portion alone yield results? As hydrological experts cast doubts and India mulls a navigating channel connecting the landlocked Northeast with sea ports, New Delhi is now weighing the possibility of also funding the dredging project in the Padma (also called Podda) — the name for the merged Brahmaputra and Ganga in Bangladesh.Dredging is the last hope for the people of Assam. The other option, which is pretty much what the people of the flood-stricken state have begun to accept, is to just learn to live with it.Floods, and the destruction that comes with them, are an annual feature in Assam, so why can’t there be a better state of preparedness?17 lakh2,50025 (out of 32 districts of the state)5280Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur are the other two NE states impacted by floods and landslides.Madhurjya Tamuli and his wife Abharani still can’t fathom what had happened to them on Tuesday noon. In just 20 minutes, as they kept watching, their home in North Lakhimpur town got inundated by flood water of the Ranganadi, a tributary of the Brahmaputra. “We did not have time even to save our valuables. We lost many important documents too,” says Abharani, a tax consultant in the town. Her husband Madhurjya is a branch postmaster.Till that fateful day, it was the home of a joint family of three brothers, Madhurjya being the youngest. Today, the three families are forced to take refuge in the homes of their friends and relatives. “We have no idea how long it will take to repair our home. Maybe we will have to break it and then rebuild it all over again,” says Abharani.Ironically, their father Indreswar Tamuli himself was uprooted by a flood in another corner of the town. In 1972, the year the town witnessed a severe flood, he built this house on a plot of over an acre. “Our father built this house at least three feet above the main road. Today, the main road is way above our house. Also, a number of big buildings have come up in the neighbourhood, leaving no outlet for the water to get discharged,” Madhurjya adds.","Sun, 16 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-59611524,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-653616,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg","['rs', 'water', 'flood', 'state', 'annual', 'tragedy', 'floods', 'assam', 'north', 'road', 'report', 'town', 'detailed', 'lakhimpur']",

GUWAHATI: In what seems to be the state’s worst deluge in three decades, the death toll in the second wave of floods rose to 15, with 10 more deaths reported on Sunday. With over 10 lakh people affected in the last 24 hours, the total number of flood victims shot up to 15 lakh across 21 districts in Assam. Over 85% of the Kaziranga National Park (KNP) was inundated.More than 1.83 lakh displaced have taken shelter in 439 relief camps. Rescue operations by the Army, Indian Air Force, National Disaster Response Force and the State Disaster Response Force personnel are underway, said state project co-coordinator of Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) Rajib Prakash Baruah. About 3,000 villagers were rescued and shifted to relief camps on Sunday, said defence PRO Lt Col S Newton.Water from the Brahmaputra overflowed into KNP – crossing six feet in many places — forcing animals to flee in search of shelter to the neighbouring Karbi Anglong district. “We will be able to ascertain the number of animal deaths only after the water recedes,” said Kaziranga divisional forest officer Rohini Ballav Saikia, adding that 148 out of 188 anti-poaching camps have been submerged.Four rhino calves have been rescued so far, Saikia said.Rail and road connectivity has been snapped in most places.

When people of six to seven villages near Jakhalabandha, Assam, fled after the Brahmaputra broke 100 metres of its embankment at Hatimura, Gobinda Goswami, 62, and his family had a difficult task at hand.

His mother Lily Goswami, in her 80s, is bedridden. By the time he could go out in the dark and cut down three banana trunks to make a raft, the water in his house was waist-deep. “We put her on the raft with great difficulty and pushed it until we reached the road. I don’t remember who provided us a handcart to bring her to this relief camp. I thank God she is still alive,” said Goswami.

His mother has been lying on a makeshift cot made by joining two benches of Sonari-Kamakhya MV School, which has become a relief camp since August 12. “She cannot get up, even chew. We are giving her liquid food. She has become so weak that she can hardly speak,” said her daughter-in-law Bharati.

“We could not bring anything. My sister and I have lost all our books, and the certificates I had got in a singing competition,” said Pompi, 12, sitting beside her grandmother. She is in class VII at Hatbor Girls’ High School and her elder sister Bhagyashree in class X, with board exams due in February.

A medical team came to the camp for the first time Tuesday. The doctor wanted the elderly woman taken to a hospital in Tezpur, but her son refused. “I cannot manage, with not a rupee at hand,” said Gobinda Goswami, who used to sell vegetables.

Kalpana Gohain, who came from Dulal-Madhab village, worked as a midday meal cook at Madhab Middle School. “Our kutcha house was washed away in front our eyes,” she said. “My husband lost the small shed where he used to sell broiler chicken. All our papers were in a plastic bag hanging from a bamboo pole, but today my husband went and found our house itself has gone.”

Kalpana and others are helping the local Rainbow Youth Club prepare food for the camp. The club has arranged for two gas stoves, paper plates and plastic glasses. The district administration has provided rice and dal, while other sources too have helped.

On Tuesday, a group of teachers and students from Nowgong Girls’ College came with soap, sanitary napkins, baby food and other items, apart from rice, dal and salt. “We have cancelled our freshers’ union of August 17 and bought these items,” said Shanti Dey, general secretary of the students’ union. “The fund of Rs 35,000 for the event was sent on these items, faculty members contributed an equal amount, and the alumni association Rs 10,000 to make it about Rs 80,000,” said Amiya Patar, who teaches Assamese.

The school has only one toilet unit for 1,200 inmates; residents of Sonarigaon and adjoining Kamakhya village have let the people use their toilets and bathrooms. “After all they are our own people,” said Krishnaraj Hazarika, whose house is next to the school.

The second wave of floods in Assam which occurred in July 2017 affected 17, 43,119 population across 26 districts. 86,223.19 hectares of crop area was affected in 2450 villages under 81 revenue circles with official death figures rising to 83 till July 30 th . 123 relief camps and 259 relief distribution centres were operational as on 13th July 2017. In the event of the emergency crisis and the worsening flood scenario Inter Agency Group Assam carried out Joint Needs Assessment in 32 affected villages in Assam based on availability of manpower and resources. The executive summary highlights some of the key findings and critical gaps in six life saving sectors.

Analysis of the sector on food security and livelihood has shown that 56% of the affected people have food availability for less than a week and 34% of the people have reported availability of food for a period of 1-3 weeks. This leads us to the conclusion that that over 90% of the affected people will be without access to food after three weeks. Only 9% of the people reported food sufficiency for a period of one month. Significant amount of decrease in food intake among male, female and children were also reported. 91% of the people reported availability of fodder only for a period of less than a week. The district administration had set up relief camps across affected districts which were insufficient to meet the needs of the affected people. 44% of the Assessed areas reported that no relief camps were in operation. 38% of the relief camps were found to be inaccessible to persons with disabilities, transgender, SC and STs.

Among other WASH concerns it has been found that only 31% of the villages had access to safe drinking water while more than half i.e. 69% of the villages had no access to safe and clean drinking water.

Similar conditions were also reported from other affected districts of Assam as observed by our assessment teams as well as through SitReps, print and electronic media. 84% of the villages were found to be defecating in the open, thereby increasing the chances of diarrhea or cholera outbreak. This indicates the need for installation of temporary / transitional toilets with public health promotion awareness campaigns as a short-term measure. However, there is a need for constructing flood resilient toilets, considering Assam being hit by floods every year. On the availability of safe drinking water, 78% of the villages are under the risk of water contamination at source with only 22% reporting little or no risk of water contamination. The situation is quite grim. Hence, there is immediate need of water testing of all existing sources and chlorination to ensure access to safe water, thereby preventing any potential water and sanitation related diseases. There is an increasing awareness to incorporate inclusive, participatory, and gender-sensitive strategies for implementation of response programmes. It may be suggested that menstrual hygiene management (MHM), should not be limited to distribution of sanitary pads, rather address the socio-cultural practices around MHM. There is a need for strategic planning to address MHM with a gender-sensitive and inclusive approach.

Analyzing the aspect of shelter among the affected population a total of 4050 houses have been found to be affected by flood from the 32 assessed villages in which 210 houses were fully and 696 houses were partially destroyed. It may be mentioned here that release of water by NEEPCO in Lakhimpur led to inundation to villages downstream and several houses were damaged due to siltation.

Health services were also not adequately met post disaster in comparison to services available predisaster.

Some of the major reasons for lack of health services were non accessibility, damage to buildings due to siltation and washing away due to overflow of water. There is need for setting up of immediate and continuous medical camps in affected areas. It was reported that post flood situation is likely to get worse once the water recedes leaving behind debris which would lead to communicable diseases and health problems for all particularly children.

Due to flood and erosion many of the schools are in risk. Large scale displacements have forced children’s access to school cutting them off from their peers. Books and teaching learning materials (TLM) have been damaged for large number of children in most of the districts. Of the total number of 83 flood related death 23 are reported to be children.

On the issue of protection, women and children were found to be in vulnerable condition. Among the most vulnerable were pregnant and lactating mothers and the elderly and differently abled persons of the village. No safe and private facilities were made available for women and girls. It was also brought to light that children and youth of some of the families have migrated to different places for livelihood to support family making them vulnerable to the trap of human trafficking. On this concern Dhemaji & Majuli Districts were found to be in high risk of human trafficking.

Coordination by Inter Agency Group Assam was carried out at state and district level throughout the assessment period. Immediate response was carried out by member agencies after preliminary assessment considering the urgency of the crisis situation. Unified Response Strategy (URS Matrix) was circulated to all the member agencies for information sharing and coordinated approach to humanitarian response. IAG Assam coordination meetings were held at the state level and district IAG meetings were also organized at district level.","Wed, 02 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/917029-joint-needs-assessment-report_assam-floods_2017_final.png?itok=ECAlQqY2,"['water', 'reported', 'relief', 'flood', 'needs', 'assessment', 'affected', 'joint', 'food', 'floods', 'assam', 'villages', 'need', 'report', '2017', 'india', 'safe']",

Assam floods indicate impact of disaster is being determined by several inter-linked factors. These factors are unique in different parts of the same region. Therefore, the exercise of devising strategies for disaster risk reduction to deal with flood becomes multifaceted. The flood situation in Assam created by incessant rainfall and overflowing of the Brahmaputra has taken several lives and caused injuries across many districts. Assam is still struggling to deal with the ongoing floods and has also dealt with the similar situation in the past.

According to Assam State disaster management Authority report of 14th August, 2017, floods have affected 25 of the state’s 32 districts. In all 3,192 villages are reported to be inundated. Nearly 32 lakh people are directly affected. Nine of the state’s rivers are flowing above the danger level.

The nature, type and cause of floods across different parts of the state are different. In some areas flood situation is worsened due to high level of siltation and rising river bed. This is specially the case in Majuli district.

Poor maintenance and resultant failure of embankments and erosional activities are other contributing factors leading to recurrence of floods causing high magnitude of losses and damages.

Floods in urban areas such as Guwahati are a result of yet another set of contributing factors such as inadequate urban drainage, poor maintenance of drains and improper land use planning. A single flood event can not be attributed to climate change but shifting rainfall pattern is also influencing the characteristics of the floods.

In such a context, disaster risk reduction efforts to reduce flood losses require due attention to not only the direct causes but also the social milieu, economic diaspora, natural environment, ethical and cultural practices. These processes are complex in nature owing to historical background and the present processes of development and urbanization. Culture influences to a large extent affect the implementation of strategies and policies.

To deal with these processes, strategies and implementation will call for a new approach undertaking pro-active initiatives to involve techno-social-cultural-economic-environmental-governance initiatives.

Social factors including education, awareness and social capital will determine to a large extent the success and failure of these strategies, included therein the ideas of economic disparity and the brutality of market forces during and post flood situation. Dualistic nature of cultural practices needs to be taken into account in fitting the solutions wherever required.

Technological solutions can be harnessed. The use of technology is prevalent in our day-to-day lives. The emergence of smart phones and its wide range of users cannot be ignored as a resource which can be used for multiple purposes like imparting training programmes, updates and basic Dos and Don’ts of different disaster events. Most of the solutions in the technological arena of disaster management can be achieved with optimum utilization of what we think is minimum (Just owning a smart phone).

The challenges to be tackled are continued from the previous disasters pertaining to livelihood practices and its sustainability and vulnerabilities. The tackling of new risks becomes difficult because the existing risks are dynamic in nature and therefore the process of crafting solutions becomes even more complex.

We very much respond to floods but not much of recovery work is seen as we are still standing at a point where we are offering only short-term response. Much of capacity building strategies like preparedness, prevention and mitigation are operational but need to be revisited for a larger, greater, broader understanding, commitment, involvement and efficient delivery of services.

Disaster risk reduction is a long term process entailing a wide coverage of issues and understanding of multiple dimensions of communities’ vulnerability and resilience. Disaster risk reduction becomes a locally-specific solution strategy wherein specificities, region specific issues, community resilience practices need to be taken into consideration.

The realization of disaster risk reduction goals demands a detailed and broader approach where strengths, weaknesses, challenges and unique local features are fully taken into account over the long run.

GUWAHATI: The flood situation in Assam improved further today with the water receding from human habitation and agricultural fields, giving relief to more people in the 12 affected districts of the state.

No fresh deaths due to the deluge were reported and the toll stood at 70, an Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) report here said.

Altogether 11.02 lakh people, against yesterday's 14.36 lakh people, were hit by the floods that have submerged 9,000 hectares of farm fields, the report said.

The districts still affected included Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Barpeta, Chirang, Kokrajhar, Dhubri, South Salmara, Goalpara, Morigaon, Nagaon, Golaghat and Majuli.

The Brahmaputra river was still flowing above the danger mark at Nimatighat at Jorhat and Dhubri town, while Dhansiri river is above the danger mark at Numaligarh in Golaghat and Kopili river at Dharamtul in Nagaon district.

With improvement in the flood situation and people returning to their homes, some of the relief centres have been closed down. A total 31,519 people were still putting up in 94 relief centres, which were in operation, the report added.

In the wave of floods this year, 2.83 lakh big and 1.71 lakh small animals, besides 4.73 lakh poultry have been affected, it said.

Infrastructure such as roads, bridges, embankments and culverts have been damaged by the floods in Barpeta, Kokrajhar, Dhemaji, Dhhubri, Nagaon and Dibrugarh districts, the ASDMA added.","Tue, 22 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2017/8/22/w600X390/assam_floo8d44.jpg,"['improves', 'relief', 'flood', 'nagaon', 'affected', 'districts', 'assam', 'floods', 'mark', 'report', 'lakh', 'situation', 'asdma', 'river']",

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who arrived in Assam for a one-day visit on Tuesday, has announced an assistance of Rs 2,350 crore for the North East, out of which Rs 2,000 crore will be used towards flood relief and rehabilitation, while Rs 250 crore would be released immediately to Assam to help the state leapfrog relief and rehabilitation work.

""The prime minister has allocated Rs 100 crore to form a high-powered committee that will conduct a study on the behaviour of the Brahmaputra river,"" Assam education and health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told reporters in Guwahati.

""The Centre had given us Rs 300 crore earlier as flood relief fund. In addition to that, we are immediately getting Rs 250 crore from the Centre for flood relief,"" he said.

The Assam minister said that the state government has already announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh each under the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund for the relatives of people killed and Rs 50,000 to those seriously injured during the floods in Assam.

While a total of 130 have reportedly died from the entire North East in the flood which has displaced over 25 lakhs people, the state of Assam has been hit the most by the deluge with nearly 83 people killed in Assam alone and over 20 lakh people affected by the flood.

Modi, who arrived at the Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport earlier today, was received by Governor Banwarilal Purohit and Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal.

A seven-member inter-ministerial central team had visited Assam on 25 July for four days to carry out an on-the-spot assessment of flood damage.

However, earlier on Monday, Congress leader and former chief minister Tarun Gogoi had criticised Modi saying that the prime minister is making a ""token visit to the state only after facing severe criticism from all quarters as he visited Gujarat, but neglected Assam.""

This year, two waves of floods in the state have affected around 25 lakh people from 29 districts prompting the administration to set up 1,098 distribution centres and relief camps, where about 1.32 lakh people took shelter.

Though the current wave of floods has receded, six districts are still reeling under floods and over 2,000 people have taken shelter in the relief camps.

9,9,FL-2017-000084-IND,'Permanent solution to floods in Assam not feasible' - Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/permanent-solution-to-floods-not-feasible/articleshow/59874461.cms,"GUWAHATI: India's top specialist in hydraulic structures, river engineering and irrigation Prof Nayan Sharma of IIT-Roorkee believes there is no permanent solution to Assam's floods but finding a durable solution should be aimed at.

Sharma welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement here on Tuesday to get a high-powered team to study the course of the Brahmaputra and its effects but underlined that India needs to discard the old techniques of containing erosion, which comes with floods, by building porcupines, spurs and embankments.

Floods in Assam are not generated in Tibet, from where the Brahmaputra originates and flows through it as the Yarlong Tsangpo, Sharma said. ""Floods are generated in Indian territory due to heavy rainfall in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Nagaland. Tibet receives about 400 mm rainfall in a year while the average annual rainfall received by Assam varies between 1,500 mm and 3,000 mm,"" he said.

Sharma underlined, however, that the growing uncertainties of the 'hydropolitics' issues with China looms large on potential diversion of the Yarlung Tsangpo in coming decades, which need to be factored in planning any project on the Brahmaputra. ""China does not share information about the specifications of its dams being built on the Yarlong Tsangpo. India has to do lot more within our country if we have to find a solution,"" he said.

Sharma, who is from Assam, is soon heading to Bihar where chief minister Nitish Kumar has appointed him as a chairman of a flood and erosion mitigation committee.

""It is not finding a permanent solution but a durable one that should be the objective. As an academic engaged in teaching and advanced research on various aspects of water resources development for over three decades in IIT-Roorkee, and four decades of scientific training, I could not find any worthwhile technical solution other than developing sizeable storage reservoirs in the tributaries of the Brahmaputra through safely designed multi-purpose dam projects,"" he said.

All existing dams in the northeast are oriented only for hydropower generation devoid of any storage space for flood control. ""Because of this, the Ranganadi dam is not able to hold back water during floods, which results in heavy flooding in the downstream areas. Similar is the case with Kopili and other hydropower dams in NE region. A possible solution can be to incorporate flood storage space in the reservoir so as to prevent such kind of avoidable floods as stated above,"" he said.

Sharma was also critical of state government's ambitious plans to dredge the Brahmaputra to contain the floods. He said, ""Apparently, it is not known whether the above dredging plan has been supported by comprehensive scientific studies by duly factoring in the huge inflows of sediment volume coming from the watershed areas, which will invariably affect the sustainability of the Brahmaputra dredged channel.""

He warned that the climate change effects are anticipated to profoundly trigger the melting of source glaciers in the Himalayas, precipitation and temperature trends, which are likely to alter the river discharge regime in coming years.

Editor's note: The flood situation in Assam has worsened, with at least 99 people dying and 22.5 lakh being affected in 21 districts. The Indian Army has been called out for rescue operations in the state. This article on Assam's lack of infrastructural and administrative response to flooding is part of a series and originally appeared on 17 July, 2017. It is being republished in view of the current situation.

***

This three-part series on recurring Assam floods will examine what ails the state's fight against this annual phenomenon. The second part will take a closer look at the existential crisis of the vulnerable Majuli island. The third part will seek to examine if dredging the river Brahmaputra is the panacea that the state has been looking for all these many years.

Former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi once famously replied to a reporter who questioned him on the government's inaction in the wake of devastating floods: ""America tu baanpani hoi,"" he said, which translates into ""Floods also happen in America."" It was an ingenious way to deflect attention from a human tragedy that is akin to an annual ritual of mayhem in the state.

The floods were often bad when Gogoi was in power from 2001 to 2016. The chief minister had three straight terms. So when the governments changed at both the Centre and state, there was hope that things would get better. However, the people probably expected a bit too much.

""Prime Minister Narendra Modi had raised hopes while campaigning — that the flood and erosion problems would be given utmost priority and people would escape the fury of nature that they were subjected to for all these many years — but nothing happened in the first two years. Assam did not get any funds, probably because Congress was in power at the state level. But even a year after BJP's Sarbananda Sonowal took over as chief minister, there is no change on the ground,"" an official unwilling to be named said.

""No fund under the National Disaster Response Force has been released to the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) during the last two years for the restoration of flood damages,"" the official added.

Though the government has claimed sufficient funds are available, a severe financial crunch has affected even maintenance of flood and erosion control infrastructure, let alone building new ones.

""There has been no change at all, though we have relatively new governments both at the Centre and the state. Despite big announcements, nothing has been implemented. There is a huge difference between what they say and what is being done on the ground,"" All Assam Water Resources Contractors' Association president Muhi Borgohain told Firstpost from Guwahati.

Sonowal had set 31 March, 2017, as the deadline before which all damaged dykes across the state were to be repaired. Clearly, this did not happen as intended.

""When the chief minister said damaged dykes, it wasn't clear whether he specifically mentioned those embankments and dykes that were damaged during last year's flood or those before that. Practically speaking, all embankments are more or less damaged and could not be repaired before 31 March,"" Borgohain said.

The damaged flood protection infrastructure was to be repaired under the SDRF scheme. ""It was estimated that 168 points at different embankments across the state will be repaired at a cost of Rs 1,500 crore. And while the funds were available on paper, the government actually had only Rs 345 crore. So it was finally decided that repair work would go ahead with the available funds and a two-phase project was initiated under the State Disaster Management Authority. In the first phase, 98 points were to be repaired at a cost of Rs 203 crore, and the remaining 70 points were to be repaired in the second phase at Rs 142 crore. Just before the monsoon set in, we somehow completed repairing the first phase. However, due to the hurriedly completed work, many of these developed defects,"" he said.

""This happened due to delay in releasing the money. So it has worked at some places and didn't work at some others. Releasing little money won't solve the issue,"" Borgohain said, pointing out to the large-scale damage that floods caused this time.

The second phase is yet to begin.

Now, leave alone the central-aided schemes, even state-run projects are facing financial hurdles because of which contractors are left to fend for themselves. Usually the deputy commissioner of a district is the main authority on whose nod the bills get cleared.

""In SDRF schemes, the norm is that the deputy commissioner has to issue a certificate stating that the work has been done to his satisfaction. But there are many DCs who delay the process and wait for the monsoon to see if the work is up to par. Even if there is a minor issue, the certificate is denied until it the problem is rectified by the contractor at his own cost,"" Borgohain said.

Apparently, many contractors are yet to get their dues because they have not been issued these certificates. This tug-of-war has also led to a stalemate going forward with effective flood and erosion control schemes.

Funding issues have also negatively impacted the lives of the people. The Laharighat embankment disaster and the one on the Ranganadi river in Lakhimpur are just two examples of such. The latter was breached at its right and left flank at Aamtala and Bogolijan, causing massive destruction.

""This was a Rs 365 crore central project. In March 2015, it cleared 30 percent of its cost. But even after two years, when the project is around 80 percent complete, the Centre has not released the rest of the money. As per the rules, it should have done when the project was 55 percent complete. The project has remained unfinished, which has led to breaches,"" the association president said.

Half-baked approach

Clutching at straws has often been the case with government agencies when it comes to tackling flood and erosion. And when the tempers of the helpless run high, governments would typically rush in with some half-baked semi-successful formula meant to give hope that a certain embankment won't be breached or an entire village won't simply vanish due to erosion.

""There are some embankment schemes for Morigaon district. But building embankments alone is not sufficient. Steps must also be taken to protect erosion and these need to happen simultaneously. An embankment was built at Laharighat in Morigaon district, but no bank protection measures were taken. The estimated cost was around Rs 20 crore while the government released only Rs 10 crore. The embankment was built but the bank was not protected. As a result, it washed away,"" Borgohain said.

This happened on Saturday. Just last week, both Sonowal and state water resources minister Keshab Mahanta visited the area and assured the people that the embankment was sturdy enough to withstand the strong current of the Brahmaputra river.

The Solengi river at Gohpur witnessed a similar situation. This year, the town was adversely affected due to floods. An embankment was built at a cost of Rs 5 crore without essential river protection, though the original cost was estimated at Rs 15 crore. Once again, the government failed to release the entire funds.

Political disruptions

The situation is so dire that even the state water resources minister offers little hope to contractors.

""The water resources minister told us that the government is not releasing funds. 'Without funds how can I make the contractors work?' is what he told us,"" Borgohain recalled.

A quiet political angle is also emerging. Mahanta belongs to Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), a coalition partner of the BJP government in Assam, while Sonowal and state finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma are both from the BJP.

""There is a silent clash brewing between the BJP and the AGP. Since the water resources minister is from a different party, the finance minister is not giving him funds,"" he said.

Corruption has reduced but not disappeared

Allegations of corruptions are common when it comes to flood and erosion control projects in Assam.

""An expense is required only to get a project sanctioned from New Delhi. There are also expenses in Dispur and on the ground. However, things have got little better after a strict monitoring system has been introduced irrespective of the scheme size. Third-party monitoring has become a norm. All projects below Rs 100 crore are monitored by state-run engineering colleges while projects above Rs 100 crore are monitored by IIT Guwahati,"" an official privy to the process who did not wish to be named told Firstpost.

Cost sharing quandary

The Modi government's intentions have come under a cloud as many flood and erosion control schemes proposed by the Assam water resources department have been lying unapproved for years. The cost sharing model has also changed with different Five Year Plans.

""According to the 11th Five Year Plan, the expenditure in the Flood Management Programme was to be shared in 10:90 pattern, with the state bearing 10 percent of the cost and the Centre shouldering 90 percent cost of the total outlay. There were 100 schemes under the 11th Plan. Only after the state gives a certificate that its share was utilised does the Centre release its share in two tranches. The monitoring of these projects is done by the Brahmaputra Board. Under the 11th Plan, there are many projects where the second tranche is yet to be released. The outstanding amount comes to around Rs 240 crore,"" Borgohain said.

There is no outstanding so far as the state share is concerned in the 11th Five Year Plan schemes.

With the implementation of the 12th Five Year Plan, the cost sharing pattern changed again. This now became 30:70: With the state bearing 30 percent of the project cost and the remaining 70 percent to be borne by the Centre.

""Forty-three schemes came under the 12th Five Year Plan. The states' share came to Rs 51 crore before BJP came to power. This is yet to be cleared. Almost the entire amount from the Centre is outstanding. Only a project in Dhakuwakhana saw 50 percent released but the rest is still to be cleared,"" he said.

After BJP came to power at the Centre in 2014, the cost sharing equation saw yet another change. This has now become 20:80 between the state and the Centre. The govt tabulated the total outstanding amount of both plans and reached a cumulative figure. ""By combining two Five Year Plans, the Centre owes Rs 1,200 crore to the contractors. This includes the Rs 51 crore of the state which has now become Rs 115 crore after the new calculation,"" the association president said.

State budget gives water resources a miss

Although the math is ready, other concerns stand in the way. In the 2015-16 state budget itself, no allocation was made to the water resources department. Following this, the association raised the matter with the chief minister and the water resources minister in December, after which it was agreed that Rs 115 crore will be included in the state's supplementary budget. The principal secretary even assured that the Rs 115 crore will be released in June (although it should have been ideally released by 31 March, the last day of fiscal year).

""The money is yet to be released. They told us the state would tell the Centre via the chief minister to include Rs 1,200 in the Union supplementary budget in July. So far, we are yet to hear any news. Even the Centre has said that the state has not established a proper correspondence. The Centre can release the money only after the state produces a certificate stating its share has been utilised,"" Borgohain said.

Raging rivers won't stop

Former chief minister Gogoi was right. Floods happen even in America. However, what his government and the one that followed did not learn was that abroad, there is always a sincere attempt to mitigate the crisis and not mire the people in a web of facts, figures and funds.

At least 225 animals have died in the Kaziranga National Park in Assam as a second wave of devastating floods lashed the state, park officials said on Saturday. As of Saturday, 30 per cent of the park was still inundated.

Earlier this month, the first wave of floods had submerged over 70 per cent of the park and led to the death of 105 animals, park Director Satyendra Singh told IANS. “The flood water is starting to recede but the pace is very slow,” Singh said. “It will take another few days to completely recede.” The dead animals include 178 hog deer, 15 rhinos, four elephants and one tiger.

The second wave of floods hit the state earlier this month, submerging 25 districts and affecting over 33 lakh people. The floods also damaged houses and public buildings, breached embankments, damaged roads and washed away bridges.

All the northeastern states have remained cut off from the other parts of India as rail connectivity snapped forcing the Railway Board to suspend train services beyond Malda and Alipurduar (West Bengal). In 2012, 793 animals died in Kaziranga due to heavy floods. Last year, a total of 503 animals were killed in the floods.","Sat, 19 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/assam-floods-7592.jpg,"['dead', 'kaziranga', '225', 'state', 'northeastern', 'national', 'floods', 'assam', 'animals', 'tiger', 'wave', 'park']",

These sprouted 19 years ago in an experiment to save the animals of the 434-square-km park from drowning in the flooded grassland dotted with large natural ponds.

Abutting the Brahmaputra river, the lowlands of Kaziranga are inundated every year and the floodwater replenishes an eco-system that sustains the largest population of one-horned rhinoceros in the world.

But the floods breached all records in 1998 and caused considerable damage to the wildlife, prompting forest officials to alter the park’s landscape. They built flat-top highlands, roundish and rectangular, to shelter the animals.

This year more than 70% of the park is flooded. Rhinos, Asiatic water buffaloes, and even carnivores, are riding out the tempest and deluge from the safety of these islands that are generally 5.5 hectares in size. The largest are 12 hectares and the smallest 2.8.

These can accommodate up to 50 large animals, park officials said.

“The park has 111 highlands built in the late 1990s. They are old and need renovation but are still good enough to keep the animals out of floodwaters,” Kaziranga director Satyendra Singh said.

“We started building 33 more with a total area of 22 hectare this year, but they will have to be rebuilt after the monsoon,” he added.

The new one will be 16 feet above Kaziranga’s average altitude of 196 feet. The older islands are about 12-feet high, almost the same height as the camps on stilts for forest guards.

Kaziranga has 178 camps, of which 142 have been submerged, forcing guards to evacuate or spend nights on boats around the islands, where animals are vulnerable to poaching.

The new highlands will cost the park an estimated Rs74 lakh a hectare.

Park officials say the expenditure is worth it.

“The islands save animals that cannot escape to the hills beyond Kaziranga. We have this year lost 41 animals, including three rhinos, mostly due to drowning,” Singh said.

A dozen animals were rescued but they died on the way to a rehab near the park.

Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who inspected the flood-affected park on a motorboat on Wednesday, said his government will push for more highlands in Kaziranga and other flood-prone wildlife reserves.

“The animals on the almost-submerged highlands need fodder. I have directed park officials to do whatever it takes to ensure the animals do not starve in case the flood persists,” Sonowal said.

Apart from three drones keeping an eye on the animals, police personnel are deployed to assist 1,100 forest guards and officials to monitor Kaziranga, the chief minister said.","Sun, 16 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2017/07/15/Pictures/flood-at-kaziranga_38e6ce64-6965-11e7-ae46-9bfe7bf72e96.jpg,"['forest', 'marooned', 'islands', 'wildlife', 'sonowal', 'kazirangas', 'kaziranga', 'high', 'highlands', 'floods', 'assam', 'animals', 'singh', 'officials', 'ground', 'park', 'safe']",

The centre was supposed to release R. 2,043.19 crore between 2007-08 and 2015-16 for 141 projects but only released R. 812.22 crore. The state government fared worse, releasing only 16% of the allocated budget provision. “Insufficient flow of fund adversely affected the implementation of schemes,” the CAG report concluded.

In Assam 14 districts have been inundated with floods, over 2 lakh people are displaced and over 70 people have lost their lives, in this year alone. Floods are a natural phenomena in these areas because excessive monsoon rains cause flooding regularly, but shoddy preparedness has only made the situation worse.

“There were huge delays in completion of River Management Activities and Works related to Border Areas projects which were long term solutions for the flood problems of Assam, North Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh,” the report found. “There were discrepancies in execution of works like irregular award of work, splitting of tenders, payment at higher rates.”

The CAG report evaluated 206 Flood Management Programme projects, 38 flood forecasting stations, 49 River Management Activities and works related to Border Area projects and 68 large dams in 17 states and Union Territories between 2007 and 2016. They found “inordinate delays” in almost a quarter of the projects, in release of funds and ultimately completion of projects ranging from 10 months to 13 years.

In none of the 17 states were flood prone areas even assessed scientifically. After two decades of investing in telemetry systems, that provide real time data so that flood warnings can be issued, and investing of crores of rupees the government still depends on manual data, the CAG noted.

14,14,FL-2017-000084-IND,Lessons from Assam: India’s flood control policy must go beyond embankments - Scroll.in,https://scroll.in/article/849501/lessons-from-assam-indias-flood-control-policy-must-go-beyond-embankments,"A humanitarian crisis of epic proportions is unfolding in South Asia. The region has experienced devastating floods leading to a loss of over 1,000 lives in India, Nepal and Bangladesh. Senior research fellow at the Institute of Water Policy, Robert James Wasson, has spent years studying floods in Assam in eastern India. Here he talks about his views on the Indian government’s policy of building embankments to control floods.

WaterPolicy.online: Annual flooding in Indian states such as Bihar and Assam is a huge problem. But this year, reports say that the flooding is particularly severe. Is there any particular reason why?

Robert James Wasson: At the moment the reasons for the severe rainfall and flooding are not clear. The only stand-out anomaly is the Indian Ocean, which has been warmer than usual, thereby providing more moisture to the atmosphere. It will take some time for climatologists to work out what is and has been happening, including what is called an attribution analysis whereby the role (if any) of climate change is assessed.

WaterPolicy.online: Why is the Indian government policy for flood control heavily aligned towards building embankments?

Wasson: Embankments as a solution for flooding have a long history in India, stretching back to the Mughals and the British. When the British established cash crops in Assam and Bihar in particular, floods represented a severe threat to revenues. Embankments were seen as the solution. Once embankments are built, more cropping is possible in previously flood-prone areas and this, in turn, needs to be protected, thereby leading to the construction of more embankments.

The techno-fix represented by embankments fitted the time when the idea of conquering nature was in vogue. Engineers dominated the advice to the government but some engineers in British India argued against embankments because of their propensity to cause waterlogging and disease in stagnant water, and also because they are likely to breach. Also, there was and still is a political and business imperative at work. Politicians can point to embankments as a tangible sign of their activity, and the private sector benefits from both construction and maintenance contracts.

But many lay people, environmentalists and academics have argued that embankments cause more problems than they solve, and this criticism and debate continues. But young people in flood-prone areas have no experience of life without embankments and have not maintained the traditional coping strategies of houses on stilts, for example. And during severe floods, villagers camp on embankments with their animals.

WaterPolicy.online: Has the embankment policy been successful in flood control?

Wasson: Strangely there does not appear to have been an analysis of the Indian flood death and damage data to see if embankments have had any effect. We have analysed the data showing that between 1953 and 2011 damage (adjusted for inflation) has increased across India, but deaths (adjusted for population) have remained unchanged and, importantly, have not declined. However, adjusted deaths during the period from 1982 to 2011, when embankments were much more extensive, declined but the area affected by floods also declined, thereby confounding a simple explanation of the reduced deaths. Damage data is yet to be fully explored.

In Assam, where we have done the most detailed research, neither deaths nor damage has systematically changed through time, despite extensive embankments. But many deaths and some major damage have occurred during the largest floods. This may be evidence of the “levee effect” whereby the construction of levees (or embankments) leads to an unwarranted sense of enhanced safety and complacency among people and decision makers, and people begin to live and build close to rivers. The largest floods then cause massive damage and many deaths.

WaterPolicy.online: What kind of policies do we need to mitigate the damage from floods? How should the Indian government approach these policies?

Wasson: While there is some evidence for a positive effect of embankments, they do not provide protection during the largest events, but they do provide refuges for people and their animals. However, flood mitigation policies that compliment embankments are urgently needed to mitigate the impacts of the largest floods. Such policies might include floodplain zoning and possible relocation of at-risk people, enforcement of the existing building code to make sure that construction is robust, insurance, better warnings, refugees, education and, probably most importantly, more local authority for flood mitigation planning and implementation so that people do not just wait for the government to act but take more responsibility for their own safety.

WaterPolicy.online: Can you provide some historical perspective to Assam’s floods?

Wasson: Assam is prone to both large damaging floods and great earthquakes. The great earthquake of 1950 in upper Assam generated a huge number of landslides that have added sediment to the Brahmaputra river and thereby raised its bed. The floodplain has not been raised by sedimentation at the same rate as the channel bed, so floods extend further across the floodplains despite embankments because the embankments are not continuous and often breach.

It appears that the increase in the bed level of the Brahmaputra has stopped because the landslide sediment from the 1950 earthquake has been exhausted, an idea that needs to be thoroughly checked. If this is correct, floods may not get progressively worse, but will still be dangerous during large rainfall periods such as at the moment and as climate change takes hold. Of course, when (not if) another great earthquake occurs, the same set of processes will recur, along with the likely destruction of many embankments by ground shaking.

WaterPolicy.online: Is there any permanent solution to Assam’s flood problem?

Wasson: Assam will always be flood-prone, and floods will get larger as the climate changes because of the Greenhouse Effect. But the institution of the policies listed above, along with better maintenance of embankments to limit breaches, will reduce deaths and damage.

The second wave of floods in Assam has inundated 80 per cent of the 481 sq km area of the famed Kaziranga National Park and claimed the lives of over 140 animals, including seven rhinos.

Since August 10, seven rhinos, 122 swamp deer, two elephants, three wild boars, two hog deer, three sambhar deer, one buffalo and one porcupine died, KNP Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Rohini Ballav Saikia said here on Thursday.

""Carcasses are being recovered daily,"" the official said. Out of the seven dead rhinos, six drowned while the other died of natural causes. Water of the Brahmaputra river entered the KNP, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, through river Difloo on 10 August, the DFO said.

Intensified water patrolling was on by KNP guards, task force, protection force along with those from NGOs, Wildlife Trust of India and forest department employees for rescuing, recovering and making assessment of species trapped or dead in the KNP, Sakia said.

At present, animals in KNP are moving in search of food available on both sides of the NH-37 and the adjacent tea gardens towards the higher altitudes of Karbi Anglong district, the official said.

GUWAHATI: With floods wreaking havoc across different districts in the state, those in flood relief camps now face the danger of various health-related ailments.

The recent spate of floods has rendered thousands of people vulnerable to contamination of drinking water sources. Food sources are limited, access to medicines is restricted, sanitation has been compromised and the susceptibility to infections has increased drastically. In such a situation, the occurrence of diseases like diarrhoea, dysentery, fever and skin diseases caused by bacterial and fungal infection is on the rise among inmates at flood relief camps.

""There are reports of people suffering from diarrhoea, dysentery, fever and severe skin infection in the relief camps. Skin infection could be due to exposure to sun and emanating from bacterial or fungal infection because flood waters carry different kinds of microorganisms. We are monitoring the situation and distributing medicines,"" said an official in Lakhimpur district.

The onset of heavy floods since June had also resulted in the emergence of enteric fever or typhoid cases in Dhubri district.

Last week, the state chapter of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme ( IDSP ) being asked to indicate the necessary measures taken.

As on July 14, there were 176 such cases reported from Dhubri district alone. So far, the total number of cases since the onset of floods since June is has gone way above the 700-mark as reported from Dhubri.

During the 2014 flood spells, there were cholera cases that were reported from Lakhimpur district. It resulted in three deaths. The cholera cases were attributed to floods.

People with a weaker immunity system are also the most vulnerable lot, and the chances for them getting infected with any forms of communicable diseases are high during heavy floods.

21,21,FL-2017-000084-IND,Severity of Assam floods heightens old fears about dams in the Brahmaputra basin - Scroll.in,https://scroll.in/article/844509/severity-of-assam-floods-heightens-old-fears-about-dams-in-the-brahmaputra-basin,"After the Ranganadi – a tributary of the Brahmaputra – overflowed and submerged large swathes of land in Assam’s Lakhimpur district on July 9, calls to decommission the dam on the river have grown loud again. The dam, people in Lakhimpur claimed, exacerbated the floods worse than ever this year.

The Assamese press has also heavily criticised the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Limited, the public-sector company that administers the dam.

Old accusation, new occasion

The accusation that the Ranganadi dam aggravates the problem of flooding in the downstream district of Lakhimpur is as old as the dam itself, which became operational in 2001.

The Ranganadi dam was touted as the North East’s first run-of-the-river dam. These dams differ from conventional dams as they do not have huge reservoirs but generate electricity by harnessing the energy of flowing water. The dam is located at Yazali in Arunachal Pradesh’s Lower Subansiri district. As water from the Ranganadi flows downstream from Arunachal Pradesh to enter Lakhimpur in Assam, the dam’s walls stop the flow. Then, a certain amount of the water is chanelled into a tunnel over a distance of 10 km. The tunnel drops 600 metres to another river called Dikrong. This is done so as to achieve the head – the difference in height – required for the water to rotate turbines that produce electricity.

Dikrong is one of the bigger north bank tributaries of the Brahmaputra. It originates in the Nyishi hills of Arunachal Pradesh, flows through the state’s capital Itanagar, before flowing downstream to the plains of Assam where it joins the Subansiri-Brahmaputra river system at Lakhimpur.

Environmentalists have contested the Ranganadi dam’s claim to run-of-the-river status, pointing out that the transfer of its waters through the artificial channel from Ranganadi to Dikrong has dried up the Ranganadi.

Besides, people living in the areas downstream say that the river bed has become shallow over the years as silt from the dam site at Yazali is periodically flushed into the Ranganadi river. While the exercise is imperative to keep the dam in good health, residents of Lakhimpur believe it has increased the frequency and intensity of flash floods in the district.

The North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Limited has consistently denied these allegations, which crop up every time there is a particularly harsh wave of floods in the district.

This year too, as news spread about the alleged role of the dam in the current wave of floods in Lakhimpur that has killed at least 11 people, the company said that the dam had, in fact, minimised damages. In a press-release, the company blamed the floods on the “incessant torrential rainfall in the catchment areas of river Ranganadi since June 30”.

Damage control

But with Assam’s civil society organisations refusing to buy that defence and threatening a mass agitation, the public sector organisation held a press conference at its headquarters in Shillong, where its chairman and managing director AG West Kharkongor addressed the media on July 18.

“There has been a lot of misinformation that the havoc that has been caused in the district has been attributed to the release of water by NEEPCO [North Eastern Electric Power Corporation],” Kharkongor reportedly said. He then went on to explain how the dam helped cushion the impact of the July 9 floods by diverting a portion of the Ranganadi’s water into the Dikrong.

Kharkongor was referring to the water that goes into producing electricity. As the Ranganadi is stopped by the walls of the dam, 160 cubic metres per second of its water is channeled into a tunnel. The water finally strikes three turbines with force, generating electricity. The chairman further added that inflow of water on July 9 had reached over 1,500 cubic metres per second, and since the capacity of Ranganadi’s reservoir was only 200 cubic metres per second, there was no choice but to release the excess water to protect the structure.

‘Abnormal and unusually fast’

However, Kharkongar’s first claim that the dam controlled the flood damage on July 9 was contradicted by the Ranganadi project’s senior manager, S Sharma.

Sharma told Scroll.in that the tunnel that transferred water from Ranganadi to Dikrong had “stopped working for some time” that day as the generator that drove the water in the tunnel malfunctioned, resulting in the water being released back into the Ranganadi. “It was a mechanical fault,” he said. “You cannot anticipate such things.” However, Sharma maintained that 160 cubic metres per second of water was a trivial quantity, and would have not have significantly added to the deluge. “It would have happened anyway,” he insisted.

According to Arup Kumar Sarma, professor of civil engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology in Guwahati, the significance of an extra 160 cubic metres per second of water was subjective. “It really depends on how much water Ranganadi could hold that day in the areas it overflowed,” he explained.

The capacity of the river is 1,291 cubic metres per second. People in Lakhimpur, thus, believe that a difference of 160 cubic metres per second may have made a difference. “We understand that they have to release water, and we have made peace with that,” said Dwarika Prasad, a resident of Gourighat Balijan village, one of the worst-affected places in the floods. “But since they have made the river bed shallow, even if a small amount is diverted it is a big respite [for people in downstream areas].”

A river that changes every season

By design, if the Ranganadi flow is greater than 160 cubic metres per second, the surplus water is released into the river downstream to protect the dam. In the winter, the river flow is, more often than not, less than that. Therefore, no water is released into the Ranganadi at all, which results in a practically dead river. “We can cross the river on foot in the winter,” several people living in downstream areas in Lakhimpur district said.

In the summer, however, as torrential showers strike the region, the river flow invariably exceeds 160 cubic metres per second. This leads to the release of water from the dam. The North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Limited argues that the water is the Ranganadi’s itself, so the dam could not possibly be held responsible for the floods.

The different natures of flooding

That is a contention that environmentalists and people living in downstream areas strongly disagree with. “This is not about the volume of the water,” claimed Partha Jyoti Das, head of the Water, Climate and Hazards Programme of the Guwahati-based non-profit Aaranyak. “The nature and patterns of the floods would have been very different in the absence of the dam. People living in downstream areas always lived with natural floods always, but with the dam, the river’s course has been altered and the nature of floods has completely changed. Yes, there would be floods even without the dam, but the hazards would be much less.”

Residents of the many downstream villages Scroll.in visited agreed, saying that the force of the water has become much greater ever since the dam came into existence. “You should see the way the water came this time,” said Dipen Bora of Amtala village, which was ravaged by the floods on July 9. “It did not seem like river water, it was like water in a drain.”

Also, people claim that the continuous flushing of sediments at the dam site at Yazali has raised the river bed significantly, so it was unfair to say that the dam has not increased the intensity of the floods.

National security vs research

However, Das, who is currently working on a report on the Ranganadi, conceded that in the absence of scientific data it was difficult to counter the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Limited’s claims. “The government just won’t release data to researchers, citing national security issues,” claimed Das, co-author of Damming Northeast India, a study of hydropower development in the region. “That is why NEEPCO gets away always.”

He added: “The last time there was a huge flood in 2008, IIT Guwahati was supposed to come out with a fact-finding report. The report hasn’t been made public till date.”

Other academics who have tried studying the Ranganadi also bemoaned the lack of transparency. “They can never be wrong technically, because they provide no information to prove them otherwise anyway,” said a researcher who had studied flood forecasting systems in context of the river, who did not want to be identified. “It is like being asked to validate black holes without a telescope or scientific equipment.”

In India, flow data of the rivers in the Indo-Gangetic and Brahmaputra basins is treated as classified and covered under the Official Secrets Act. This has often hampered research. For instance, in 2010, a government glaciologist VK Raina was refused access to his own work that he had done during his tenure in the Geological Survey of India, on the grounds of secrecy.

Of warnings

In Lakhimpur, however, people want something much simpler: an early warning system that informs them of the incoming water from the dam. “Earlier we’d see the river, and know what to expect and prepare accordingly,” said Keramat Ali, a resident of Bogoleejaan village near North Lakhimpur town, where the river wreaked havoc earlier this month. “But now with the dam, it all depends on when they release water. And now the water comes in much faster than earlier, so we have no time to react, and, say, take our cows to higher grounds at least, if nothing else.”

Although a siren goes off 30 minutes at the site of the dam before water is released, people living in downstream areas of Lakhimpur, which is almost 100 km from the dam, are too far to hear it. Additionally, the dam authorities inform Lakhimpur’s district administration, which is supposed to make public announcements.

According to people living in downstream areas of the district, the district administrator has often failed to warn people. Public announcements are rare. Even if they are made, it is only in and around the town or North Lakhimpur, said residents of villages along the river in Lakhimpur. “I’ve never heard any kind of public announcement, informing us of water being released,” said Bhadreshar Baruah of Amtala village.

Lakhimpur deputy commissioner Barun Bhuyan claimed information was erratic and often not relayed on time. “NEEPCO [North Eastern Electric Power Corporation] should also make public announcements in the downstream villages, but they do not,” he said. “After all, it is their dam.”

In 2015, the North East Electrical Power Corporation pledged to sponsor a community-based flood early warning system on the downstream of Ranganadi river in Lakhimpur. However, no such system exists, an official from the district administration claimed.

Professor Sarma of IIT-Guwahati said that since the water stopped by the gates of the dam came down with considerable force when released, it was important to have a series of alarms. “One alarm won’t work because of the distance, so there could be a series of alarms, each at a fixed distance from the previous [one],” he said. “It is called a relay alarm system, each alarm triggering off the next.”

The big dam looming

As Lakhimpur recovers from one of its worst floods in almost a decade, residents are keeping their fingers crossed. Even as they get used to the Ranganadi dam, they may have to confront a much bigger dam soon: the 2,000-megawatt Lower Subansiri hydropower project on the Subansiri river. (The Ranganadi dam’s power-generation capacity is 405 megawatts – almost one-fifth of the Lower Subansiri.)

The Subansiri is another tributary to the Brahmaputra, albeit much bigger than the Ranganadi. Construction of the dam has been kept on hold since 2011 following an order of the National Green Tribunal and mass protests by various indigenous groups.

But recently, the Assam Assembly’s voiced unanimous support for the project and the chief ministers of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh promised to fast-track it, so construction may resume soon.

In the wake of the floods, fears about the Lower Subanisiri project have increased even more among residents in Lakhimpur. “The Ranganadi, they say, is a small dam,” said a farmer in Bogoleejaan. “If a small dam can cause so much damage, I don’t know how much a big dam will.”

“Well, if they build that dam, our Lakhimpur will become a rich place,” remarked another resident of North Lakhimpur town. “After all, only the rich can afford to stay in water-proof houses on five-metre high platforms, isn’t it?”

Around 10 pm the next day, at Gourighat Balijan village, Bhadreshwar Barua peered out of the window in the living room of his mud-plastered house.

He was keeping a nervous eye on the embankment, some 300 metres away, that stood between his village and the raging Ranganadi river, a tributary of the Brahmaputra. The earth-fill embankment was intact, but he could hear the river crash against it, with what seemed like great force. With the rain showing no signs of relenting, Barua knew it was a matter of time before the embankment gave away. “I could hear it,” he said. “They had released water at the dam upstream.”

The dam on the river

Ranganadi is one of the smaller tributaries of the Brahmaputra. It originates in the Nilam, Marta and Tapo mountain ranges in Arunachal Pradesh, flows through the Lower Subansiri and Papum Pare districts of the state, before flowing downstream to enter Lakhimpur in Assam where it joins the Subansiri-Brahmaputra river system at Khichikagaon.

The already small river has diminished even more in the past few years, people living around the river claim, after an eponymous hydro-electric dam on the river at Yazali in Arunachal Pradesh became operational in 2001. Unlike earlier, one can cross the river on foot even in the winters, they say.

The winter Ranganadi and its monsoon counterpart are, however, a study in contrast. As torrential monsoon showers strike North East India starting in May, and continuing till almost August, the river often assumes unmanageable proportions. The difference, people living in downstream areas of the river say, has become accentuated after the dam came into existence.

‘But at least we survived’

By 10.30 pm on July 9, Barua’s worst fears came true: the embankment was breached. In no time, there was water all around, washing away everything in its path: people, animals, crop fields and bridges. “Two of my cows drowned,” said Barua. “The fields are buried in sand now. But at least we survived.”

In the adjoining village of Joinpur, as Joydeep Barua watched the river wash away the trailer of his newly-purchased tractor, he did not run towards higher ground like the other residents of his village. Instead, he rushed inside his house, almost completely submerged by then, to retrieve the tractor’s insurance papers. “I was sure he would drown,” said one of his neighbours. He did not, but he could not salvage the insurance papers.

Majgaon, which along with along with Joinpur and Gourighat Balijan comprises the Amtala revenue circle, was probably the worst affected. At least 11 houses were completely washed away, leaving bare vestiges behind.

By the end of the week, the water receded, leaving almost all of Amtala in ruins – damaged houses, farms buried in sand, hundreds of livestock dead. But the Ranganadi, after wreaking havoc in Amtala, breached its embankments at Bogoleejaan, further downstream. This relieved the pressure in Amtala, with the water moving on to Bogoleejaan, residents say. “We wouldn’t be talking today had the breach at Bogoleejaan not occured,” said Gourighat Balijan’s Dipen Bora.

People in Lakhimpur suspect that in addition to the incessant rains, their woes were exacerbated by the excess water released by the dam – the project can handle up to 160 cubic metres per second of water and anything more than that is released back into the river. The North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Limited, which runs the dam, has shot back in a press release that the situation would have much worse if the dam was not there.

While few in Lakhimpur buy that explanation, the resentment of people in the district, one of the worst-affected in the current wave of floods in Assam, is directed at the failure of the embankments. Embankments are the most widely used techno-engineering defence against floods in Assam. There is a strand of thought that views them as counter-productive, exacerbating water pressure rather than containing angry rivers. But they have become indispensable in the current scheme of things, as people living close to the river view it as a safety-net of sorts.

The embankment fails yet again

“So much money is put into these embankments,” said Keramat Ali, a resident of Bogoleeejan. “What is the point if it can’t even save us?”

In 2008, after Lakhimpur was ravaged by a particularly catastrophic wave of floods, a project worth Rs 362 crores was announced to rebuild and repair embankments along the Ranganadi river. The cost was to be borne by the central government and the state government, with the former paying 70% of the total expenditure. The project, which has been marred by legal tussles, corruption charges, face-offs between the administration and contractors, remains incomplete till date.

Annual repair work on the embankments between November and March is considered crucial in Assam as a preparatory exercise for the imminent floods. But no construction or repair activity took place in the dry season in Lakhimpur at all this time, owing to a clash between contractors and the forest department over royalties. Contractors employing earth excavated from forest areas in embankment-construction work are legally bound to pay royalty to the district forest department.

By the time construction was resumed at the end of March, the first batch of pre-monsoons rains already arrived, said Rahul Bora, a contractor. Lakhimpur’s deputy collector, Barun Bhuyan, also confirmed that construction had been late to begin this year.

The embankment on the left bank of the river, which got breached this year, runs for a length of 27 kilometres. In 2014, too, the embankment at Amtala was breached at the almost exactly the same spot. “Nine years, they haven’t been able to complete a 27-km stretch,” rued Ali. “And the breach happened at two places this time.”

Blame game

With public anger against the embankment breach boiling over in the district, the district administration and the contractors are blaming each other. Lakhimpur’s district collector Bhuyan, conceding that there is “public resentment”, blamed the contractors for the debacle. “It’s completely their fault,” Bhuyan told Scroll.in. “The state government had released its share of 30% funds, but the Centre hasn’t because the work not yet fully complete. They should have completed the work ahead of the rains.” According to the arrangement of the project, the Central government is supposed to release its share only when 55% of the work is completed, something that Bhuyan claimed, the companies contracted haven’t done.

The Assam Water Resources Contractors’ Association, a body of the state’s embankment-building contractors, has stood defiant, maintaining that the Union government didn’t release funds on time even though they had completed almost 80% of the job.

‘It will come again’

Meanwhile, queries about relief activities in the affected areas elicited a range of responses, from extreme dissatisfaction to “the government couldn’t have done more”. In Amtala, people complained about the state government’s intervention being lacklusture. “We did get rice, pulses and salt once, but nothing after that,” said Ganesh Hazarika. “The NGOs have been giving us water and food, though.”

Lakhimpur is currently teeming with volunteers from non-profits, both local and international, assisting affected people in the many submerged parts of the district.

Hazarika said that the state government was much more swift and pro-active in 2014, the last time the Ranganadi had breached the embankment at Amtala. “What we really need are tarpaulin sheets to protect the cows,” he said. “We have already lost so many of them. There is so much talk about gau-mata. Don’t our cows matter?”

However, in Bogoleejaan revenue circle – the other location of the breach – people said the government had commendably stepped in, providing food and other relief materials. “We’d be lying if we said the government hasn’t done enough,” said Bulbul Ali, currently residing in a state-government administered relief camp in the district.

As of Tuesday evening, more than 15,000 people in the district have been affected by floods and over 1000 people are still lodged in relief camps. At least 11 people – the highest among all flood-affected districts in the state – and more than 5,000 animals have died.

Lakhimpur’s story is not unique – embankments have been breached in many other places. In Morigaon district, damage to an embankment resulted in the inundating of over a dozen villages. It is a story that repeats every monsoon. People living close to the Brahmaputra and its many tributaries anticipate the floods, and prepare themselves too. They stock up on food, move livestock to safer ground. Yet, the floods leave a leave a trail of devastation almost every year inevitably. Often, the damage is exacerbated by embankments that breach only too easily. The death toll this year has already reached 65, and more than 500,000 people have been affected so far.

The worst is probably over for the year for Lakhimpur’s people. But as Keramat Ali of Bogoleeejan said: “It will come again. Will the embankment be complete by then?”

Key Highlights 1.25 lakh people in five districts of the state are still reeling under floods

Toll in flood-related incidents in Assam this year stood at 157.

15,500 hectares of crop area was inundated, the ASDMA said.

GUWAHATI: The flood situation in Assam continued to improve on Monday, although 1.25 lakh people in five districts of the state are still reeling under it.

According to a report by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority ( ASDMA ), 1.25 lakh people remain affected currently in Chirang, Morigaon , Nagaon , Karbi Anglong and Golaghat districts.

Till Sunday, 1.6 lakh people were suffering due to the third wave of floods across six districts of the north-eastern state.

The last wave of floods had claimed the lives of 73 people across Assam and the toll in flood-related incidents in the state this year stood at 157, including eight in capital Guwahati, the ASDMA said.

As per the ASDMA report, Morigaon was the worst hit with over 74,500 people affected, followed by Nagaon where nearly 48,000 people were hit by the deluge.

As many as 299 villages remained under water and nearly 15,500 hectares of crop area was inundated, the ASDMA said.

The authorities are running 82 relief camps and distribution centres in five districts, where 23,545 people have taken shelter.

The Dhansiri river at Numaligarh in Golaghat, the Barak at Badarpurghat in Karimganj, the Katakhal at Matizuri in Hailakandi and the Kushiyara at Karimganj town are flowing above the 'danger' mark.

Key Highlights Total No. of people who lost their lives in flood-related incidents has gone up to 52.

2,240 villages are under water, 79,000 hectares of crop areas inundated and 17.43 lakh people are affected.

363 relief camps, distribution centres are running in 19 dists, where 25,269 people have taken shelter.

GUWAHATI: The flood situation in Assam remained grim on Friday as three deaths were reported and nearly 15 lakh people in 25 districts of the state still affected by the deluge which also inundated more than half of the Kaziranga National Park.

According to a report by Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), three persons have been killed in various flood-related incidents in Dhemaji, Dhubri and Nagaon districts.

With this, the total number of people who lost their lives in flood-related incidents this year has gone up to 52, including eight in Guwahati.

ASDMA said at present more than 14.97 lakh people have been affected by the flood in various districts, including Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Sonitpur, Darrang, Nalbari, Barpeta, Bongaigaon, Chirang, Kokrajhar, Dhubri, South Salmara, Goalpara, Morigaon and Nagaon.

Till Thursday, 17.43 lakh people were affected in the latest wave of flood in the state.

At the Kaziranga National Park, 62 per cent of the area is under water, leaving some animals dead and some moving to nearby highlands.

Some animals were killed by speeding vehicles on the National Highway 37, which passes through the Park.

ASDMA said 2,240 villages were under water at present and more than 79,000 hectares of crop areas inundated.

The worst affected was South Salmara, where over 3.07 lakh people have been affected by the deluge, followed by Morigaon with more than 2.23 lakh people being affected.

In Guwahati also, water logging incidents have been reported, ASDMA said.

Authorities are running 363 relief camps and distribution centres in 19 districts, where 25,269 people have taken shelter.

The government has distributed 2,903.25 quintal of rice, 596.92 quintal of pulses, 366.25 quintal of salt and 472.52 litre of mustard oil among the flood victims since yesterday, ASDMA said.

Across the state, 14,18,043 animals and poultry have been affected by the flood.

Many roads, embankments and bridges have been damaged by floods in many districts, including Goalpara, South Salmara, Dibrugarh, Lakhimpur, Sivasagar, Majuli, Barpeta, Golaghat , Jorhat, Nagaon, Kokrajhar and Udalguri.

Brahmaputra river water was flowing above the danger mark at five places — Guwahati, Nimatighat in Jorhat, Tezpur in Sonitpur, Goalpara and Dhubri towns.

Other rivers like Desang Naglamuragat in Sivasagar, Dhansiri at Numaligarh in Golaghat and Kushiyara in Karimganj town were flowing above the danger marks.

Railways joins relief and rescue operations

Railway minister Suresh Prabhu on Friday asked senior rail officials to work in close coordination with state governments of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) to ensure smooth relief and rescue operations.

Prabhu convened a special meeting of Railway Board officials to take stock of the flood situation.

He also asked the officials to ensure that drinking water supply, food grains, medicines and healthcare facilities movement for northeast is given priority and ensure their smooth transportation by the railways.

He directed the officials to extend possible assistance in repairing roads so that smooth connectivity be provided for rescue and relief.

Rail services are fully operational in the states and have not been affected by the floods, said a senior railway ministry official.

Living just four kilometres from the Brahmaputra, this is not the first time that Abani Sarma, 78, has been forced to flee home and take refuge in a relief camp. But this time, he says, he did not get enough time to grab his possessions — his diaries in particular, all carefully preserved in three steel trunks since 1962.

“I began writing my first diary in November 1962, when the Chinese marched into India through the Kameng frontier. Since then, I have recorded all important events, including their local implications. I managed to save those diaries during the last big flood of 1973, because we got enough time to escape,” says Sarma, a resident of Bor-Bhakati village.

Sarma is among the over 1,200 people from five neighbouring villages — Bor-Bhakati, Dulal-Madhav, Miribheti, Sonaribagan and Nagshankar — who have taken shelter at the Sonari-Kamakhya MV School here, after their villages were submerged soon after midnight on Saturday. The school was converted into a relief camp by residents of Sonarigaon, about 180 kilometres from Guwahati.

On Tuesday morning, as school headmistress Labanya Saikia hoists the national flag, Sarma and the others gather around to sing the national anthem.

“On August 15, 1947, I accompanied my father to witness the first flag hoisting at Silghat,” recalls Mohan Bordoloi, the gaon burra (village headman) of Sonarigaon.

Old timers recall how then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru walked through Sonarigaon in 1959. The neighbouring village, Kamakhyagaon, has a library named after his sister Vijayalakshmi Pandit.

“I clearly remember a local girl, Bhogila Hazarika, garlanding Nehru near a gate that the villagers had erected to welcome him,” says Bordoloi.

After the brief ceremony, the conversation returns to the Brahmaputra.

“When a neighbour, Jitumoni Saikia, called me up at around 1:30 am on Saturday and told me to run for my life because the Brahmaputra had breached the embankment at Hatimura, I did not believe him. But, even as I heard other villagers shouting, the flood water had already entered my house. We just flung open our doors and ran towards Sonarigaon, which is higher than the surrounding area. We ran, carrying just one or two items that we managed to pick up,” says Chandra Mahanta, also of Bor-Bhakati village.

Like Mahanta and Sarma, most of the other villagers at the relief camp were unable to grab anything much from their homes as they fled for their lives.

“I heard that my house, which the government gave me in 1986 under the Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY), has been destroyed. I and my wife somehow managed to reach this school, wading through neck-deep water,” says Lakhidhar Gohain, 55, a vegetable vendor from Dulal-Madhav.

“I had a mekhela-chadar-riha set made of muga silk that my mother-in-law had inherited from her mother-in-law. The almirah in which I had preserved the family heirloom for about 40 years is now under four feet of water, as our house is still submerged,” says Gita Mahanta, 77, of Bor-Bhakati village.

While there have been reports of some flood-affected districts not getting timely relief material, the 27 camps in Kaliabor are better off, partly because the local MLA, Keshab Mahanta, is also the state water resources minister.

The camp in Sonarigaon is managed by members of the local youth club. “Our gaon burra, Mohan Bordoloi, is working almost round the clock, maintaining the records of people as well as relief material coming from the government and voluntary groups,” says Kaustabh Hazarika, secretary of the club.

“While the residents of Sonarigaon contributed rice, dal and vegetables for the first two meals on Sunday, we received relief material from the government by Sunday evening,” says Prasanta Pathak, a club member.

The government has provided 12.5 quintals of rice and 80 kgs of dal, while a Guwahati-based NGO has sent 75 kgs of rice, 40 kgs of dal, 1,500 bottles of water and 600 eggs. “Bhaiti Bora, a local grocer whose shop was submerged, managed to save 40 kgs of rice, which he donated to the camp,” says Pathak.

“One NGO sent 100 packets of sanitary napkins, an item that is not included in the government relief manual,” says Ghanakanti Borah Saikia of Miribheti, a weaver who lost two looms in the flood.","Wed, 16 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/assam-flood-7591.jpg,"['relief', 'water', 'camp', 'sarma', 'floodhit', 'sonarigaon', 'assam', 'tricolour', 'managed', 'rice', 'school', 'mahanta', 'local', 'village']",

GUWAHATI: Flood-ravaged Bordubatop village in Morigaon, nearly 58 km from here, is staring at a new crisis: shortage of drinking water. Seven-year-old Farhan and his elder sister Gul have to wake up early in the morning and trek almost half a mile to reach the nearest hand pump to fetch drinking water. Their dwelling unit, a thatched house, was damaged in the floods that swept the state recently. But now that the water has receded, there's no drinking water.

""We have to make at least four rounds to the hand pump daily. Everyone in the family needs water to drink and cook. We also have a well but the flood waters have brought in a lot of silk and the well water is not safe for drinking or cooking any more,"" said Farhan before running for another round.

""Besides Morigaon, Dhemaji, Lakkhimpur, Barpeta, Bongaigaon, Dhubri, Nagaon, Dibrugarh and Hailakandi districts are facing severe drinking water crisis ,"" sources in the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) said. The unprecedented floods have left most of the water sources contaminated.

Aware of the possibility of a major drinking water crisis, the state government had included installing of tube wells and distributing of water packets in its relief and rehabilitation drive. Sources said nearly 1,115 tube wells were distributed to the affected.

""At least 76,135 packets of drinking water, with each pack containing about 200 ml, were distributed in Barpeta, Dibrugarh, Hailakandi and Kamrup (metro) districts,"" the ASDMA flood report on Monday said. Several NGOs and volunteer groups also distributed drinking water packets.

Hiten Gogoi, a farmer from Lakhimpur's Nowboicha area, hit out at the Prime Minister in anger. ""He should visit us and do something for the people instead of shedding crocodile tears on social networking sites,"" he said, adding that in 2014, three children died of cholera. ""Water-borne diseases are looming large over the state,"" he said.

Health department sources confirmed receiving reports of people suffering from diarrhoea, dysentery, fever and severe skin infection in the relief camps of Lakhimpur. In Dhubri district, about 176 typhoid cases were reported last week.

With one more death in Morigaon district on Monday, the flood toll reached 83. The Dhansiri continued to flow over the danger level in Golaghat district.

Around 4,670 people are still struggling in Lakhimpur and Jorhat districts, while 366 have taken shelter in relief camps. Nearly 2.09 lakh hectare of cropland was ravaged.

Express News Service

LAKHIMPUR: His life is wedded to floods. They have been a common reality, all through his 76 years of life. Sibaram Das migrated to Amtola Milanpur in Assam’s North Lakhimpur district 20 years ago, from his native Gualgaon Molabindha, which is about 30 km away in the river island of Majuli.

“Majuli has a history of floods and I grew up being ravaged by them,” says Das. “In 1997, I decided to migrate to Amtola Milanpur, which was considered a safer place, along with my wife Memsi, seven sons and two daughters. We settled on a piece of government land beside the Ronganadi river.”

“But life here has been no different. Floods wash away our house and livestock every year,” he says, while the cavalcade of Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi passes behind him. Gandhi visited a nearby village which turned into a virtual desert after the angry Ronganadi breached its embankment for about 200 meters.

Memsi and their son Jone are excited about the Gandhi scion’s visit. They have been waiting since morning by the riverside, where the leader is expected to speak to flood-ravaged villagers. Das’ house was also washed away in the floods. The family is among the many lodged in a makeshift enclosure on the embankment. District authorities provide them rice and pulses, which help them get by. Jone is a daily wage labourer. So are six of his other children; but they live elsewhere. Both his daughters have been married off.

“I don’t know how I will rebuild the thatched house. I have no savings,” says Das helplessly. In its current form, the house stands on bamboo poles without a roof or any side fences. Jone had collected bamboo poles from a neighbour to erect the poles.

Das says he was into agriculture at one point of time, back in his native in Majuli. “But I had to give up due to floods and soil erosion. After I migrated, I maintained the family for almost two years selling firewood that I collected from the forest. Later, I sold fish. But now, it has been three years since my health failed and I stopped working,” says Das.

Das’ hopes are pinned on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Sarbananda Sonowal cannot solve this problem. But Modi can, for he is the PM. I appeal to him to rescue us from this perennial problem.” Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi, who had spent 10 minutes there, had left for another site.

Key Highlights The number of flood-hit districts has come down to six, with about 9,000 people still remaining affected.

However, three more deaths were reported from flood-ravaged Morigaon district in central Assam.

In this year's floods, the death toll in the state has reached to 82.

GUWAHATI: The flood situation in the state continued to show significant improvement on Saturday, even as rain continued to lash several parts of the state and the weather department forecast heavy rainfall till August 2.

According to the latest flood report issued by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) on Saturday evening, the number of flood-hit districts has come down to six, with about 9,000 people still remaining affected. However, three more deaths were reported from flood-ravaged Morigaon district in central Assam, taking the death toll in the state to 82 in this year's floods.

As of Saturday, Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Golaghat, Jorhat, Sivasagar and Karimganj still remain under the deluge, with most of the 15 lakh people hit this year by one of the worst floods in recent history having returned to normal lives. ASDMA stated that there are 483 inmates at present across the 14 relief distribution camps at present, but unofficial sources indicate this number can be higher because floodwater has not receded in many parts of northern Assam because of incessant rain for the last 48 hours.

Major rivers in the state are flowing below the danger level mark, but ASDMA officials said improvement in the flood situation will largely depend on the intensity of rains in the next couple of days. The Guwahati-based Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) of the IMD has predicted heavy rainfall over Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura from July 30 to August 2. RMC also forecasts heavy rain at isolated places over Arunachal Pradesh from July 31 to August 2 as a result of southwest monsoon activity.

During the last 24 hours, light to moderate rainfall occurred at most places over Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura and at many places over Assam and Meghalaya, with isolated heavy rainfall over Arunachal, Assam, Meghalaya and Mizoram.

Though the water levels have receded below the danger level in a few districts, the situation continues to be forbidding. As many as 1,100 villages are still under water, 65 people have died of drowning or electrocution and over 17 lakh people have been affected across the Brahmaputra and Barak valleys. Poultry and agriculture have been adversely affected and, with close to 80% submersion, the Kaziranga National Park has undergone unprecedented damage. Mainstream Indian media devoted little attention to the floods in 2016 that affected about 16 lakh people, and the extent of coverage has only marginally improved this year. Having said that, the government’s callous approach to this almost annual calamity is equally, if not more, alarming and is rarely held up for scrutiny.

Most reports in the media speak of statistical facts around water levels, the number of villages and people affected, the death toll and so on. The idea of floods and consequent deaths in Assam every monsoon has been so normalised in the minds of the government, the media and a significant portion of mainland India, that a deeper inquiry into the reasons for the state’s plight seldom finds discussion on public platforms.

Breached embankments form a significant cause of the floods in Assam. The water released from the Ranganadi dam in Arunachal Pradesh recently caused the breach of about a 50-metre portion of an embankment in Lakhimpur, submerging several acres of land. The Lakhimpur district serves as the catchment area for the water released from this 450 MW hydroelectric project. Similar embankment breaches have occurred in the Majuli district. The Assam government has taken some action, sanctioning Rs 62 crore for the affected regions according to The Telegraph.

However, the indifference of the central government is beginning to show and priorities of the state government too appear to be misplaced. The recent ‘Namami Brahmaputra’ celebration is perhaps one of the starkest demonstrations of this fact.

In April this year, Guwahati hosted what is being publicised as the biggest river festival in India, ‘Namami Brahmaputra’. It was a five-day celebration, claimed by the ruling BJP government to have been organised in honour of the river Brahmaputra, to showcase Assam’s “cultural strength and economic importance” to the world and promote tourism. It was an extravagant multi-crore project with activities spread across 21 districts, marked by elaborate Varanasi-esque aartis conducted by priests specially brought in from Varanasi and attended by several state dignitaries. The event was inaugurated by President Pranab Mukherjee, with Union ministers including Babul Supriyo, Nitin Gadkari and Mahesh Sharma in attendance. The event was also attended by the Dalai Lama and Baba Ramdev (who briefly demonstrated his yoga moves as part of the cultural celebrations) amongst others.

Presumably, significant expenses were incurred for the publicity activities of the event, which included a high-definition music video featuring artists from across the country including Amitabh Bachchan, Kailash Kher, Usha Uthup, Vishal-Shekhar, Arijit Singh, Zubeen Garg and Papon, to name a few. While at first glance, Namami Brahmaputra may seem like a harmless, well-meaning effort to connect the state of Assam with the rest of the country, given the prevailing socio-political conditions of the state, such a celebration becomes problematic for a number of reasons. Believed to be modelled after the ‘Namami Gange’ mission aimed at cleaning and protecting the Ganga, the Assamese equivalent had no apparent environmental cause in mind. The name of the event itself ran in to controversy for its Sanskrit roots (“namami” translating to “I worship thee”), which is arguably an invisibilisation of the state’s indigenous heritage and a rather political implantation of North Indian Hindutva notions. The method of worshipping through aartis does not find resonance with a significant fraction of the Assamese population, especially the kshatriya culture which does not believe in idol worship. According to a local priest, traditional Assamese practice has been to revere the river but not worship it the way the Ganga is worshipped in North India. Given how little the locals could identify with the festival and the video that promoted it, it was seen by some as a patronising, Hindutva-heavy representation of mainland India’s fantasy of the river.

For all its emphasis on drawing mainland India’s attention to Assam, the response received by the state’s present condition from the mainstream media or even the government is appalling. More importantly, given Assam’s annual tryst with floods from an overflowing Brahmaputra, the Namami Brahmaputra festival, which met its expenses with taxpayers’ money, is symptomatic of a general disregard for the state’s needs and a blatant lack of prioritisation on the government’s part. During its state election campaign in 2016, the BJP represented by Sarbananda Sonowal promised specifically to look into flood-related issues and to dredge the river bed to increase the depth of the river and consequently reduce flooding.

Another significant cause of concern for the region arises from the mega-dam projects planned to be constructed in Northeast India, specifically Arunachal Pradesh and Assam. Given its geographic orientation, a significant fraction of Assam will be affected by the water released from these projects. During the BJP’s election campaign in 2014, the prime minister had categorically vouched to honour the region’s movement against large dams and focus on smaller projects to generate energy. Soon after the elections, the central government gave the nod to the 3000 MW Dibang valley mega dam in Arunachal Pradesh which once built, will sweep away approximately 4,500 hectares of forest area and displace indigenous people, particularly the Idu Mishmi community. It is particularly noteworthy that once functional, a significant portion of the power generated will be channeled out of the Northeast. Pending forest clearance after a recommendation issued by an Expert Appraisal Committee, the 3097MW Etalin hydropower project also continues to be a major environmental concern to Northeast India. In the past, the government has openly stated that with respect to the Northeast, environmental concerns may take a back seat as compared to the country’s strategic interests. While the promises won the BJP government sweeping victories on both instances, they were not subsequently honoured.

Quite evidently, there are issues that the government needs to prioritise and channel its spending towards. Given its enthusiasm to participate in the Namami Brahmaputra celebration, it is ironic that it took a good one week of incessant rains and accompanying loss of life and property before the central government extended its support to the state. Recently, Kiren Rijiju, Union minister of state for home affairs, visited Assam to review the situation in the state. It is about time we recognise that the region needs more than just ex post facto efforts on the part of the government. The present situation is demonstrative of the lackadaisical attitude of the authorities both at the state and the central levels – while the state government is visibly distracted, the central government unsurprisingly metes out a second-class treatment to the region, not considering promises made to voters worth honouring.

It is futile to celebrate the Brahmaputra if no active measures are taken to contain its annual wrath. Even after the floods recede, the state is plagued by various diseases, shortage of food supply and a serious lack of medical facilities. Embankment breaches must be minimised and rainwater effectively drained out so that the loss incurred during the monsoon can be tackled before it wreaks havoc. These are infrastructural expenditures that need to be undertaken on priority. There is no denying that efforts at enhancing the region’s connectivity with the rest of India and enhancing tourism are commendable; however, there are more alarming concerns that have not yet been tackled. It is not justifiable by any stretch of the imagination that money collected from the people is spent on celebrations they cannot understand or relate to, while hundreds of villages drown every year. In other words, Assam cannot afford the extravagance of Namami Brahmaputra. For the resources it holds and the exploitation it is subject to, the Northeast is yet to receive its due national attention, both in terms of governmental action and public awareness. Namami Brahmaputra is a textbook example of these misplaced priorities.","Thu, 20 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Namami-Brahmaputra-Assam.png,"['prevention', 'water', 'namami', 'brahmaputra', 'flood', 'needs', 'significant', 'affected', 'northeast', 'state', 'assam', 'rehabilitation', 'extravaganzas', 'india', 'river']",

However, for the past two weeks, she hasn’t been able to attend classes because her school is submerged under flood waters.

Despite that, Anjuara has been able to keep up with her studies, thanks to a floating school that holds classes on a boat for students of inundated schools in Assam’s Barpeta district. “Our school in Tapajuli Char is under water.

Classes on the boat are held for two hours every afternoon. The boat travels to the three ‘chars’ to pick students up from their marooned homes

But we are able to continue with our studies by attending classes on the boat,” said the Class 4 student of Alipur primary school. Like Anjuara, nearly 60 students of three primary schools located on Mazidbitha, Bheragaon and Tapajuli ‘chars’ (sandbars) in Barpeta district benefit from the novel initiative. In Assam, sandbars formed by silt deposition of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries are populated by nearly 25 lakh people. These ‘chars’, located in 14 districts, are severely affected during the annual floods.

“We began conducting the classes on the boat six months ago. It proved a blessing for the students during the floods,” said Jahidul Islam, a development worker with Jhai Foundation, which launched the initiative.

Classes on the boat are held for two hours every afternoon. The boat travels to the three ‘chars’ to pick students up from their marooned homes.

“Initially there was some hesitation from some parents. But now there’s no such issue. The students look forward to the classes and parents are also happy,” said Jahidul Beg, who teaches English to the students.

There are over 2,000 villages located on the ‘chars’ of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries. Over 68% of residents in these villages live below the poverty line and face problems related to erosion and flooding.

In Majidbitha Char and nearby areas, schools remain closed for nearly three months every year due to the rising waters of the Beki, a tributary of the Brahmaputra.

`“Floods damage our houses and crops. But thanks to the classes on the boat, the studies of our children don’t get affected,” said farmer Kasim Ali, whose two children, Magroon and Kohinoor, attend the classes daily.

The school on boat has become popular and there’s demand from other areas to start similar initiatives for flood-affected students. The Jhai Foundation is planning to get a bigger boat or buy another one to cater to more students.

Nearly 23,000 of the 51,898 schools in Assam have been affected by floods this year. Many of the schools that remain above water are acting as relief camps for thousands in the flood-affected districts.

“The animals in Kaziranga National Park are running for their lives as the floods disrupt their habitat”. “Devastating floods in Kaziranga – animal death rising”. “Animals struggle to survive as floods inundating Kaziranga!”

These are some of the headlines that gain prominence every year during the monsoon or rather the flooding season. Pictures of animals swimming towards the highlands or stuck in rapid current hit just the right emotional chord.

Floods are the villain! A natural calamity! Why does it ever happen? Why every year? Why can’t government do something to stop this? This last question is perhaps the most common especially as it adapts to every woe one can imagine. But has anyone given a close thought as to who’s plight we are really concerned about? That of the wild animals or our own? Let’s take a closer look.

Truth is, floods play an important role in maintaining key ecosystem functions and biodiversity. They link the river with the land surrounding it, recharge groundwater systems, fill wetlands, increase the connectivity between aquatic habitats, and move both sediment and nutrients around the landscape. For many species, floods trigger breeding events, migration, and dispersal. These natural systems are resilient to the effects of floods. Apart from the environmental benefits, flooding also helps the economy through increased agricultural and fish production, recharge of groundwater resources, to mention a few.

The Kaziranga national park is situated on the south bank of the river Brahmaputra and primarily consists of alluvial grasslands, woodlands, tropical moist mixed deciduous forest, and tropical semi-evergreen forest. In layman’s terms Kaziranga is a flood plain, and as the term suggests, floods are the primary means by which it keeps its own health alive and that of the animals that inhabits it. This is the way it is meant to be. Not having floods or stopping them will have disastrous effect on the park and its inhabitants.

Whether it is the Swamp Deer, Hog Deer, Elephants, Rhinos or the several hundred birds that call Kaziranga home, all have known how to deal with the floods from time immemorial. For the animals, floods aren’t the real problem; the problem is us, who have made the flood plains our home. Floods do not come naturally to human beings, which is why the “animal lover” in us tend to see these animals jostling in water as “struggling to survive”.

“Survival of the fittest” – we all know what this phrase means and that it originates from nature. The animals that inhabit the flood plains are also part of the same ecological cycle. So when the floods come, some of them may die. It is quite natural.

Indeed, the animals do undertake an unnatural struggle to survive, which is not natural. This is when they struggle to get into conflicts with human beings. Wild animals tend to move to high grounds at the time of floods, but what happens when these high grounds surrounding the park are obstructed by us who have made them our home ?

Many animals are not killed by nature but by the opportunistic killing of those who come across these stranded migrating animals, mainly for their meat.

Then there are casualties that take place on the highway that passes alongside Kaziranga. Many animals die in collisions with speeding vehicles. During the floods, though, the numbers are much higher as the animals attempt to reach the hills of Karbi Anglong by crossing the highway. Organized gangs of wildlife criminals are waiting in the shadows to make a killing out of such high value animals.

During the floods, Kaziranga authorities try their hardest to reduce animal-human conflict situations. A number of non-government organisations and individuals wholeheartedly support this endeavor and work tirelessly to minimize such conflicts by controlling vehicular traffic and rescuing animals that foray into nearby villages.

But anti-poaching measures take their toll. Once rhinos or tigers reach the hills, many do not return because of a lack of monitoring or “eyes” that can keep watch, which means that they may have been poached for their body parts. There have also been cases where poachers have ventured inside Kaziranga and killed rhinos stranded in highlands, even as the staff is engaged in saving the animals from the floods.

In this wheel of life called Kaziranga, paying attention to animals killed in collisions by speeding vehicles is far more mundane, as well as dangerous, than animals killed by the flooding Brahmaputra. It is time all of us looked beyond the headlines.","Thu, 20 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/07/kaziranga.jpg,"['stuck', 'struggle', 'collisions', 'kaziranga', 'right', 'killed', 'highlands', 'floods', 'animals', 'swimming', 'park']",

A rhino floundering through flood water, nostrils and eyes just visible over the flood line, has become an iconic symbol of Kaziranga. Each year, the Brahmaputra river floods during the monsoon, inundating the state of Assam. People are displaced, wildlife scatters and infrastructure is destroyed. Yet the flood has a unique relationship to Kaziranga National Park.

The park is in the Brahmaputra floodplain and is a mosaic of forest, wet grasslands, riparian areas and wetlands. Flooding is essential for the area. In fact, it has shaped the ecosystem. For example, flooding creates exchanges in nutrients and fish between wetlands and the river and silt deposition regenerates the plain. But another unique thing about this national park – shaped by nature but demarcated by the political and administrative human hand – is the way its wild animals are characterised.

Each year, dedicated teams from forest departments and NGOs rescue scores of animals from the floods in the Kaziranga landscape. While natural disasters generally have unknown or unquantified tolls on wild animals and nature, Kaziranga’s abiding efforts to save its wildlife is both unique and sustained. It grants a degree of citizenship to the animals. Traditionally, human interventions in sanctuaries for wild animals have been looked down upon. The late Machali, Ranthambhore’s tigress – also known as the most photographed tigress in the world – was kept alive through frequent capture and medical interventions, which evinced its fair share of criticism. Machali was so familiar that she was granted personhood. When she died, she was given a state-sponsored funeral, dying more as a Great Lady than as a tigress.

In Kaziranga’s inhospitable, mosquito-ridden, leech-inflamed terrain, wild denizens – rhinos, elephants, hog deer, swamp deer, tigers, wild buffalo and many more – are treated as inherently wild until the flood arrives. Then it appears that the gap collapses between wild and dangerous, and between the familiar and those needing help. Rescuers brave life and limb to save and also rehabilitate these wild animals, with admirable determination and resilience. While we have an understanding of loss to human and life and property, amazingly, such a roster also exists for Kaziranga’s animals.

A study using satellite images of the annual flooding in Assam between June and July 2012 revealed that “4.65 lakh hectares was submerged, 3,829 villages marooned, and 23.08 lakh people were affected”. In 2017, 144 people were reported to have died in Assam. This year, more than 140 animals, including seven rhinos, 122 swamp deer and two elephants (known, incidentally, to be excellent swimmers) have died. Several others also have been rescued this year. But key questions remain unanswered.

One, the Kaziranga flood shows that landscape ecology needs to be privileged over just protected area boundaries. While the park itself is in a low-lying area, wild animals need to move to higher ground. The adjoining and higher Karbi Anglong hills are a traditional dispersal and sheltering area during floods. However, there are a host of growing disturbances between the actual (and well-protected) national park and increasingly disturbed surrounding areas. In the immediate landscape, quarrying permissions have been granted, cars speed and brick kilns have operated. Further, similar to many other protected areas, human settlements are expanding. Not only are animal migration corridors being cut (the animals usually reach Karbi Anglong hills only after crossing a highway), highlands have also been taken over by people. However, unlike in other parks, the issue of ‘encroachment’ is problematised and framed as an illegal, foreign act.

It has been alleged that ‘encroachers’ in the national park are illegal and Bangladeshi both, a charge that is only likely to be more flammable under the political current regime, which has a hardline policy against Bangladeshi settlers. The cracks are deep. In an eviction drive last year, two people died in clashes with the police. What this confrontational politics will mean for the future of panicked and dispersing animals is unclear. Will people, already in conflict with the authorities, find themselves at the centre of more profound human-wildlife conflict? Will the animosity clear the area of settlers, only to make way for more grandiose development schemes? Or will the area be safeguarded from human disturbances?

Two, while the flood is a natural phenomenon, it is difficult to say how climate change will further impact rainfall and flooding. One of the ways out, say many people connected to field conservation in Kaziranga, is to artificially create more highlands and islands for the animals to seek refuge in. If the impacts of floods are getting exacerbated by humans – such as human-made obstructions for wild animal dispersal as well as disturbances to river flow – then human engineering providing an answer is only fair, many argue.

Three, while Kaziranga is a national park and a centre for amazing biodiversity, it is also an important route of commerce. National highway #37 goes through the park, with a steady stream of both commercial and private vehicles that cause both death and disturbance to wildlife. The National Green Tribunal has been listening to the matter of disturbance and illegal construction within the park and its eco-sensitive zone. On the tribunal’s orders, speed sensors and interceptor vehicles have been deployed to monitor vehicles.

Now that the floods are receding, animals will be moving back inside the park and are in a particularly vulnerable position. In the early spate of floods, many animals are killed on the highway every year (apart from in other collisions throughout the year). This July, of 81 animals killed, 13 died on the highway after being hit by cars. Many suggest that at least during the flood and its aftermath, the highway should be completely shut down. It is well established that roads have a severe impact on species—causing not just death but also disturbance, and an aid to poaching. Despite regular accidents, there are plans to expand this highway.

The flood comes each year. Despite the forest department’s best efforts, wildlife dies each year, sometimes flooded and drowned, often commercially poached. But while many other animals might die anonymous and unmourned deaths, Kaziranga’s unique story sometimes grants its own some space in a government roster, sometimes even a second life.

If the wild animal is a conscionable entity, then this is problematised by the fact that though a flood can be seen as an ‘act of god’, human activity certainly is not. If people continue to block refuge and highways are further expanded, then acts of god become more cruel and, irreversibly, more anthropogenic.","Tue, 29 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tiger-in-Elephant-Grass-1-1.jpg,"['brahmaputra', 'flood', 'kaziranga', 'floods', 'politics', 'assam', 'animals', 'rhinos', 'national', 'human', 'area', 'highway', 'wild', 'park']",

The 55-year-old has lost 3 ‘bighas’ (nearly 1 acre) of jute cultivation in the present deluge.

He’s not alone. Nearly 7,000 residents of 12 villages in Goalpara district who are dependent on the jute crop for their livelihood have witnessed loss of around 2,000 acres of cultivable land to surging waters of the Brahmaputra.

It’s an annual cycle. For 3-4 months each year, these farmers seek refuge on the embankment with their valuables, cattle and other livestock as flood waters submerge their homes and crops.

“Jute cultivation takes lot of effort. In the years when the rainfall is good, we have a good output. But during ‘bad’ seasons, like the present one, floods inundate the fields completely and damage crops,” said Sar Sadullah Ahmed, president of Takimari ‘gaon panchayat’.

Residents of seven other villages, which fall under the same ‘gaon panchayat’ are lucky. Their homes and fields are located on the other side of the embankment and so flood waters don’t wreak such devastation.

“No such luck for us. It takes four months to harvest one jute crop. The damage caused by this year’s floods, will affect all farmers in this area and our families,” said Phulbar Ali, 60, who lost 8 ‘bighas’ of standing crop.

Nearly 3,000 villagers of these 12 villages are residing on the embankment since July when the first deluge struck Assam. Besides their homes, three schools have also remained submerged affecting studies of hundreds of students.

Not every villager owns a boat and many use rafts made of banana stems to go to their homes to collect necessary items and bring to the embankment. No government relief has reached these villagers yet.

“We made our makeshift houses with things given during last year’s floods. No one has come to provide food, medicines, fodder for our cattle and compensate for the crop loss,” complained Jelemon Bhawa, a 45-year-old resident.

She also wants the government to provide drinking water (all tube-wells in the area are under water) and construct toilets for the affected.

“I have submitted a list of requirements including few boats to the district administration. We are still waiting for response. There’s also the fear of diseases spreading, once the water level subsides,” said Sadullah.

According to Jute Corporation of India, Assam is India’s third largest jute producer after West Bengal and Bihar. Nearly 80,000 farmers in the state are engaged in jute cultivation and produce around 1.3 lakh metric tons of jute fibre each year.

According to the Assam state disaster management authority figures, over 3.82 lakh hectares of crop area have been affected by floods this season. In Goalpara district, 3,755 hectares of crop area have been inundated in the second deluge.

GOALPARA: Assam has been dealing with the issue of large scale illegal immigration from Bangladesh since independence. While political parties have allegedly played with the insecurities of the indigenous people, insurgents have often gone on a killing spree.

Identifying illegal immigrants from authentic Bengali-speaking Muslims living for generations in Assam has been a herculean task which neither former Asom Gana Parishad and Congress nor the present BJP governments have taken any initiative into.

With no traditional land holding in Assam, many of the 'newer arrivals' of illegal immigrants take shelter in the river islets of the Brahmaputra. However, with erosion gradually reducing land, many of the migrants have shifted into the mainland of the districts thus creating a rift with the local populace, who fear being reduced to a minority by the influx.

""Over the past two years, we have lost some 16 sq km (over 50% of total land) of our islet to the Brahmaputra due to which over 35% of the total population has left our islet to settle in the mainland, where it is much safer,"" said Samsul Haq of Bolodmari islet. Despite the population reduction, Bolodmari still has 19,500 people spread over seven revenue villages, two of which are dominated by Bengali Dalits and the remaining five by Bengali Muslims.

Nagor Ali ,45, goes to relief camp every year during floods. When he build a pucca house near the main road of the islet three years ago, he never imagined that the Brahmaputra bank some 2 km away would come to just 10 metres from his door and gobble up the main road. ""I would soon have to leave with just the tin roof of my house,"" sighed Nagor Ali.

Some 30 km away, the Rabha and Rajbongshi indigenous people from the 3,000-strong Kokira village are scared of Nagor Ali's arrival. They live in dual fear of being washed by flash floods from Meghalaya and also by Muslim migration from the Brahmaputra bank.

""Surviving the 2004 deluge was itself a challenge. All our cattle died and we took shelter on the roofs. All the kuccha houses had collapsed. But we somehow didn't face any human casualty. But on the other side of the Bongaigaon-Guwahati National Highway 31 in Bolbolla village, over 200 people died. Many of the deceased were immigrants from the islets who did not know that our area was prone to flash floods from Meghalaya,"" said Kamal Roy, a teacher in Kokira village.

""We fear that the residents of the islets may soon cross over the national highway and encroach our lands near the foothills,"" said Ajay Rabha.

On the other hand, the residents of Bolbolla village feel sheltering the migrants is a good deed. While long-residing residents have pucca and 'Assam-style' houses made of mud and bamboo, newer entrants have mostly constructed tin houses.

According to Islam, we ought to provide shelter to asylum-seekers. The economically stronger people of our village helped the migrants build houses. We lost a lot of people in the 2004 deluge. Hence, during the 2014 floods, we were well prepared and saw minimal loss of human life,"" said Mohammad Ashraful of Bolbolla.

Differences between the indigenous people and migrants had also paved way to cooperation and camaraderie during the deluge. ""We owe a lot to the residents of Kokira who alerted us beforehand during the 2014 floods when water started pouring down the hills of Meghalaya. Accordingly, we prepared ourselves overnight which helped us prevent a repeat of 2004, added Mohammad Ashraful.

Tarun Roy, who annually goes to relief camps as his kuccha house is washed away says floods unites communities and push animosity to the sidelines.

In the relief camps, all of us are the same -- flood victims. We don't see Assamese or Rajbongshi or Muslim at the camps. We share the scant khichdi (rice stew and pulses) and the biscuits given to us by government agencies and NGOs. We don't hesitate to share spaces with other communities, which would under normal circumstances never happen,"" Tarun Roy said.","Mon, 07 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2017/8/7/w600X390/1.jpg,"['immigrants', 'relief', 'grounds', 'islet', 'reels', 'seek', 'brahmaputra', 'migrants', 'roy', 'shelter', 'bangladeshi', 'dry', 'floods', 'assam', 'residents', 'friendship', 'village']",

(Source: Rahul Rajkhowa/YouTube) Do you care? (Source: Rahul Rajkhowa/YouTube)

Water water water everywhere… Not a single drop to drink but do you care? — Rahul Rajkhowa’s latest song will shatter your heart to pieces. Shedding light on the havoc caused in Assam after the turbulent floods, his music video addresses a serious issue that somehow went unnoticed by thousands of people.

Sharing how the idea to “focus on the social issue” came to him, Rajkhowa told indianexpress.com, “I am from Assam, and every year, there are close to 20 lakh people who are affected and 1.45 million acres of land is destroyed. You can’t plant anything in these agricultural lands for the next five to six years. And, it’s funny how it never comes out as a major discussion on news channels. I remember two years back there was a flood in Gurgaon, and everybody was talking about it. But, people are dying in Assam everyday — like, the death toll from electrocution alone was 62 — and, no one knew it. I was talking to my friends in Delhi about how bad the situation was, and they were like, ‘Oh my god, humein toh pata hi nahi hai…’.”

The singer -songwriter also realised that there weren’t enough artistes or celebrities in India talking about it and it bothered him a lot. “Priyanka Chopra is the tourism ambassador of Assam, and she didn’t even share a Facebook post or tweet about it to make people aware of the situation. People weren’t doing anything. Papon shared a post on social media, but even he didn’t make any effort to help out people. The only artiste who actually went on to do something is Zubeen Garg. He sings for Bollywood once in a while, but has been going to the flooded areas and doing his bit,” he said, adding how he thought of making a small difference through his video.

When asked about the response he received, Rajkhowa said, “Lately, people have been watching my videos and it has got 2,500 views on my YouTube channel. But, some people have downloaded it and uploaded it on their own channel and the hits are way more. As long as the message goes out, it makes me happy that at least people are talking about the issue now. Many others have also written to me as to how could they help out people or donate for the cause. Even though it hasn’t got millions of views like others, the video has done its bit among the thousands of people who watched it.”

The 5-minute 6-second video has garnered more than 3,000 views so far.

The village is in the Laharighat revenue circle of flood-hit Assam’s Morigaon district.

Naziqul Islam and Khawaria Nahar didn’t speak to each other or anyone else around them for almost half an hour as they watched houses, beds, and wardrobes float on the water.

They were waiting. For the water to recede, at least the currents to weaken, so that they could go look for their house – a two-room mud-plastered house with a tin roof they had built three months ago. They had to desert it on the afternoon of August 10 as water gushed inside after the raging Brahmaputra breached yet another embankment in the vicinity.

The river overflows again

On August 10, the Brahmaputra overflowed once again in Morigaon breaching embankments at various places, just as the district was slowly recovering after being ravaged by the previous wave that struck in June and lasted till July.

As of August 17, more than five lakh people across 359 villages stood affected by the latest wave of floods in the district, according to official data. However, the state government’s records reveal that the district has just three designated relief camps, apart from 179 relief distribution centres. The three camps, records say, house 182 people.

Temporary tarpaulin structures abound on the roads that connects Morigaon town to other parts of the district.

The three-pronged journey to reach Kathoni

For instance, as one drives northwards from Morigaon town towards the villages on the bank of Brahmaputra, there are small tarpaulin assemblies on both sides of the road. But as one gets closer to Laharighat, they cease to exist – for the road itself has ceased to exist. With the river overflowing, there is no road anymore – just water.

To reach the villages close to the river, like Kathoni, one has to then take a boat. The boat takes one some distance, but not the entire way. With the currents of the water furious and unpredictable, even the most skilled boatmen get reluctant beyond a point. That is when the imperious tractor comes in handy.

Then there’s some dry land finally. The tarpaulin structures reappear – dozens and dozens of dark claustrophobic cubicles, teeming with people. Thirty two villages in Laharighat have been flattened by the river since Friday. Almost everyone from these villages are in one of these makeshift shelters.

Islam and Nahar, too, have been living in one of them since Saturday. As the water started rising, they fled. They didn’t wait for the State Disaster Relief Fund motor boats, which rescued some of their neighbours who stayed put in their houses in the hope that the water would recede only to get marooned.

‘This was supposed to be a safe area’

Islam and Nahar were not anticipating such a deluge. “This was supposed to be a safe area,” whispered Islam. “There’s the embankment. That’s why we came here after our previous house got washed away. And now everything seems to be gone again now.”

The couple moved to Kathoni from another village called Gorokhiya Khuti in Morigaon just before the monsoon showers hit Assam.

The main road to Kathoni village

A few feet away, their neighbour, Fazaluddin was trying to ferry a bed as he waded through waist-deep water. He, too, was new to Kathoni, having moved with his family in June. Their previous house, in another Morigaon village, was lapped up by the river in the last wave of floods in the district. He purchased some land for Rs 40,000 to build this new house, he claimed. “The water entered in a matter of hours,” he said. “And we just ran. Took nothing, except for the kids. Today, after five days, I finally managed to back to the house and retrieve this bed. This is the only thing I managed to get back. I don’t know what to do, brother. How does one lose two houses in one year?”

Fazaluddin with his family

Just then, Deepali Deka arrived at the place where Fazaludding was wresting with his bed, her mekhela, a traditional draped garment worn in Assam, hiked up high. “I’ve been wearing the same mekhela, same chador [stole], same blouse for five days,” she said. “They are all wet. But I have to wear something. The water took away all my other clothes.”

Bora and her husband were trying to go to Palasguri, the next village, the one closest to the river in Lahorighat. They, too, are going to look for their house. “The boy [their son] went on a bamboo raft yesterday,” her husband said. “He says it [the house] is gone. But my heart does not listen. I need to see it for myself.”

An abundance of fish

Then suddenly there was a burst of celebratory laughter among the boys with fishing nets lurking around the tarpaulin shacks. They had been at it the whole day. There was water everywhere – on the road, in the fields – and so were the fishing nets.

Along with the deluge, the river had brought along with it a mega fish rush in Morigaon. They said you could find everything from catfish to snakefish to rohu, if you looked hard enough and stayed patient. “Of course, you have to know how to do it, a city boy like you won’t get anything,” quipped a young activist working in the area.

“Bhokua [carp]. At least five kilos,” hollered one of the boys.

The stench of dead fish filled the air.

The school as a relief camp

In the Kathoni Middle School, about half a kilometre away, there is so much fish that one could mistake it for a Bihu feast – raw fish in steel tumblers, fish marinated in turmeric and salt, fish deep fried to save it from going bad.

This is the biggest shelter in the area. Although not officially a government-designated relief camp, it is housed in a state school, since this is the only dwelling in the vicinity that did not get submerged. The school housed 120 odd people from 15 odd families. “The headmaster has let people stay here,” said Rupa Deka, a mid-day meal cook in the school.

The biggest room of the school, a room one-fourth the size of a football field, housed nine families and almost 60 people have lived was washed themselves here since Saturday.

The bathrooms in the Kathoni Government Middle School are locked and filled with water. The standing water behind the school is where everyone in the camp answers nature’s calls – the women do it before dawn, and the men follow. There is a room with a hand pump, but it is ankle-deep in slush.

Another submerged school in Lower Assam had just shot to national prominence the previous day with social pictures of children in neck-deep water, saluting the tricolour on Independence Day. But in Kathoni Government Middle School, the school’s temporary residents claimed, nobody even remembered that it was the 71st anniversary of the country’s independence. No flag was unfurled – only a lot of wet clothes were strung up to dry in the foyer.

Lot of fish, but little rice and water

Besides, people were bogged down with a more pressing concern: there was no rice to eat although there is a lot of fish.

“All they gave us till yesterday in terms of eatables was some flattened rice,” said Rumi Das, who has been camping in the school with her family since Saturday. Said Das: “How do you survive with a few hundred grams of flattened rice for five days? Okay, they can’t do anything about the floods, but can’t they give us some food at least?”

The government also provided a bottle of water per person on Sunday, said Das, which has since run out. “We have been drinking water from the hand pump.

Dipa Das, the additional district commissioner of Morigaon, said relief material couldn’t reach the area for a few days as the roads were cut-off. “Now we’ve used a helicopter to deliver relief,” she claimed. Assam’s food and civil supplies minister Rihon Daimari also admitted on Thursday that there had been lapses in relief distribution in some areas in the latest wave of floods.

On Wednesday, some rice arrived finally: a kilogramme per family, and also a tin of dal. But the distribution exercise soon turned into a squabble, with complaints that people were being left out. Manju Saikia, a formidable lady in her fifties, waded into the scrum. “Don’t talk loudly just because you are a man,” she lashed out a man who claimed to have not got his share. The man muttered something in his breath but fell quiet.

A room in the school

Just as this little altercation ended, Kanchi Das, who was watching from a distance, broke down. Das, a septuagenarian, held her two-year old grandson in her arms, while her other grandson, who is five years old, clinged on to his grandmother’s fingers as she spoke. Das’s house got washed away on Saturday. The children’s mother died a year ago, and her son, the father, was away in the city. “There is no money or rice to feed these children,” she quivered. What do I do now? Son, you need to write about us. No one knows about our plight.”

Kanchi Das (right) and her grandchildren

The local journalist Jintu Deka, a stringer for a Guwahati-based news channel who was witness to Das’s outburst, expressed his helplessness to relay these stories to the newsroom in Guwahati. “There has been no electricity for five days now,” he said. “To file my story, I have to go to Dhing [a town in neighbouring Nagaon district]. I went one day, but then here I am struggling to stay afloat myself.”

Old habits

The population of Morigaon district is almost evenly divided between Hindus and Muslims, and as marooned residents scrambled for food and supplies, differences arose. Rumi Das, for instance, said her son had had a bad stomach for two days, and she had no medicines to give him. “A medical team did come, but they just left the medicines and went,” she said. “And then all the Muslims pounced upon it and took everything. Can we jostle with them, you only say?

The feisty Saikia joined in: “There is no Hindu-Muslim, everyone has suffered.” However, she said more Hindu families had gone hungry: “We couldn’t get our utensils, so now there is nothing to cook in. It’s difficult to share the same utensils with the Muslims, no.”

With over 35,000 hectares of its farmland affected by the floods – the highest by a long margin in the state – Morigaon’s residents will figure out the real extent of damage only after the water totally recedes. As farmer Ananta Das said: “We will get to know about our livelihoods when the water from the fields recede. That is when we will find out for how many more seasons the fields will remain uncultivable.”

39,39,FL-2017-000084-IND,India plans 800-mile highway embankment to curb floods in northeast - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-environment-floods-idUSKBN1AC27I,"GUWAHATI, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Indian government officials said they plan to build a 1,300 km (800 mile) highway along the Brahmaputra River in the northeastern state of Assam to limit damage from annual floods, even as environmentalists said it would be ineffective.

The proposed six-lane highway will cost about 400 billion rupees ($620 million), making it among the most expensive infrastructure projects in the state.

“The Brahmaputra Highway will serve the twin purpose of taming the annual floods and drastically improving connectivity in the region,” said Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal.

“This is a long-term effort to tame the Brahmaputra as it will be a road-cum-embankment aimed at checking the perennial floods in Assam,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The state has done a preliminary survey and will submit a report to the transport ministry shortly, he said.

Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said in New Delhi Wednesday that the project would be fast-tracked.

The 2,900 km Brahmaputra is one of Asia’s largest rivers. It runs through Tibet, India and Bangladesh before draining into the Bay of Bengal.

An overflowing Brahmaputra River inundates hundreds of villages and displaces tens of thousands of people every year, while also damaging property and killing livestock and wildlife. Last year more than 20 rare one-horned rhinos drowned in a national park.

More than 70 people have been killed so far this year, as the state bears the brunt of heavy monsoon rains.

India has the world’s highest exposure of gross domestic product to river flooding, with more than $14 billion exposed every year, according to the World Resources Institute.

That could increase more than 10-fold to $154 billion by 2030, WRI estimates.

Embankments are widely used in Assam and elsewhere in the country as a way to contain river flooding.

But breaches are common, causing widespread damage.

“We are yet to build an embankment that does not breach. They are a flawed way to manage floods, as they interfere with the natural flow of rivers,” said Dinesh Mishra of Barh Mukti Abhiyaan, a campaign that works with communities in flood-prone areas to manage flooding.

“They restrain the river and therefore increase its intensity, so a breach is inevitable and causes even more devastation, as we have seen any number of times,” he said.

The annual flooding of the river is a natural feature that is essential for cultivation when the waters recede. Embankments also interfere with this process, he said.

Mishra and other activists also oppose a planned $50 billion project to interlink rivers to divert water from surplus areas to those that suffer from drought. The environmental impact of the project would be huge, they say.","Thu, 27 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['embankment', 'billion', 'brahmaputra', 'northeast', 'plans', 'state', 'rivers', 'annual', 'highway', 'floods', 'assam', '800mile', 'curb', 'project', 'india', 'river']",

The patch, which enveloped parts of West Bengal, North East India and Bangladesh, signified that there had been more than 175 mm rainfall in these areas in the past 24 hours. Though this was surprising, it was not unheard of at this time of the year.

Within hours however, an unprecedented wave of floods hit these regions. The purple patch, which typically disappears within a day, lasted for 42 hours. By the weekend, floods were wreaking havoc in parts of Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Tripura, Nepal and Bangladesh.

Heavy monsoon spreads to West Bengal and Bihar by August 14: Screen shot of NASA's one-day rain accumulation map at 4 pm

At the time of writing this piece on August 12, the Central Water Commission’s flood forecasting website had marked at least seven sites in orange, signifying that water levels in these areas was less than half a metre short of the highest-ever flood level for that region. These included Torsa, Raidak-I, Sankosh, Gaurang, Beki rivers (all northern tributaries of Brahmaputra) as well as the Brahmaputra alone at three sites: Neamatighat, Dibrugarh and Tezpur. Many other sites, marked with a pink dot (signifying that river water level is above the danger mark), were likely to turn orange or red in over the next 24 hours.

Raidak-I river at Tufanganj in Cooch Behar (West Bengal) was already red at the time of writing this article, meaning that the river water level had crossed the highest ever flood level for that site. The river had crossed the earlier highest ever flood level of 36.36 m, recorded 24 years back on September 21, 1993. So, this region was seeing the worst floods in at least a quarter of a century.

Assam and parts of West Bengal that had already experienced several waves of floods earlier in this monsoon were facing the prospects of an even bigger deluge. All indicators showed that neither the state nor the Centre was ready for this new wave of floods.

The table below gives an overview of the sites where the water level was less than half a metre short of highest-ever recorded flood levels from Central Water Commission’s flood forecasting site, as on August 12.

Barring Kokrajhar, Dibrugarh and Neamatighat, the water levels were predicted to rise in all other areas over the next 24 hours.

Ganga basin flooded

That the Ganga basin could also face similar unprecedented floods in the coming days was apparent from the flood forecast of the Basua site in the Supal district in Bihar, along the Kosi river, on August 12.

The highest flood level for this site is 49.17 metre (reached on Aug 25, 2010). As of 11 pm on August 12, the river water level here was 49 metre and it was predicted to reach 49.23 m by 7 am on Sunday – meaning it would breach the highest flood level recorded so far. By Sunday at around 1 pm, Basua breached the highest flood level and water levels reached 49.23 metre and water levels were within half a metre of the highest ever level in seven other areas in the Ganga basin.

On Monday, the situation in Bihar’s Kishanganj, Araria, Purnia and Katihar districts worsened and the death toll in the state rose to 13.

Assam’s double deluge

In Assam, which had seen heavy flooding in July, has been hit hard by the second wave of floods and the total death toll has gone up to 99, according to news reports.

Here are numbers from the latest available flood report from the Assam Disaster Management Authority on the damage done so far by the the latest round of floods (as on August 13):

Dam problem

During the earlier round of floods in Assam and other parts of the North East, the role of dams, hydropower projects and embankment breaches had come into focus. Questions had been raised about efficacy of these structures. Similarly, the government’s attempt at dredging the river, creating waterways, building roads and embankments on both sides of the Brahmaputra river was also questioned.

Demands have been raised to decommission the Ranganadi Hydro in Arunachal Pradesh, the Loktak Hydro Project in Manipur, in addition to Dumbur Dam in Tripura earlier and the Lower Subansiri Dam on the Arunachal Pradesh-Assam border.

Questions were also raised about the reliability of the Central Water Commission forecasting ability, as no floods had been predicted in many areas that had went under water during the weekend. Their flood forecasting has been criticised for coming too late, being erroneous or just not available to the right people at right time.

In Delhi and NCR, the monsoon rains have been playing hide and seek in the past one week. The intensity of these rains was mainly light in nature. The rains, however, did bring relief from the prevailing sultry weather.

The heavy rainfall in Mumbai in the past few days has filled the lakes up to 70 per cent. The Indian Meteorological Department has predicted good rains and thundershowers to continue in Mumbai. Kolkata has recorded a whopping 74 mm of rainfall in the last 24 hours.

For Rajasthan, Skymet Weather has predicted that the state will witness moderate to heavy rains. Districts such as Udaipur, Chittorgarh, Bhilwara, Jalore, Sirohi, Pratapgarh, Barmer will witness isolated heavy showers, while light rains are likely to continue in the capital city Jaipur as well as Bikaner.

According to Skymet weather heavy rain is expected in North Gujarat and adjoining South Rajasthan, West Bengal, and few parts of Jharkhand. Weather is expected to remain subdued over most parts of Tamil Nadu, Rayalaseema, South Interior Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and West Rajasthan.","Mon, 24 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DFBKqpUV0AEGtel.jpg,"['improves', 'flood', 'wreak', 'state', 'districts', 'heavy', 'rajasthan', 'havoc', 'rains', 'assam', 'witnessing', 'weather', 'gujarat', '2017', 'situation', 'monsoon', 'parts']",

GUWAHATI: Amid the current surge of attention to the northeast’s ecological ills, flood veterans here take pains to correct the nuances of ‘mainland’ India’s understanding of the problem. Beta, soil erosion, not floods, is the greater problem, they say.

To people whose awareness comes from newspaper photographs, what’s the difference? Floods are seasonal but erosion occurs throughout the year. Here’s some perspective: Since 1954, Assam has lost 4.3 lakh hectares of land to erosion, which is 7 per cent of the state’s area. Or to use a more accessible yardstick, land seven times the size of Mumbai.

Majuli in eastern Assam, Mukalmua and Goalpara in southern Assam and Morigaon in central Assam are the most erosion-prone areas in the Brahmaputra valley. Locally, Majuli is known as a sweet-water river island in the Brahmaputra. At the beginning of the 20th century, it was an expanse of 1,250 sq km. For years, the Guinness Book of World Records recognized it as the largest river island in the world. Even by that record-keeper’s reckoning, it was an expanse of 880 sq km. When last measured in 2014, it had shrunk to 352 sq km. Its name persists in the Guinness Book more as a notion than as a reality.

A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought the nation’s attention to the northeast, Assam government officials said the focus is welcome but it’s important to know the nuances. “When there’s a flood, people migrate to safer places and return home when the water recedes,” said a senior Assam government official, asking not to be named. “But soil erosion takes away their homes and land and triggers mass displacement. There’s no coping with that.”

According to him, the greater dimension of the problem of displacement is social and cultural.

“When erosion-affected people from lower Assam migrate to upper Assam, it feeds social unrest. If they are Muslims, it stokes suspicion that they are illegal Bangladeshi migrants,” he elaborated.

Indeed, there is a large Bengali-speaking population in lower Assam, many of them settled rather too close to the Brahmaputra. When they lose their homes and hearths, they cannot but migrate. Migration gives rise to attendant social problems. Take trafficking for instance. A whole environment of transporting people to greener pastures arises, leading to trafficking of children, women, workers, etc.

Former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi has always maintained that erosion is Assam’s greater problem, not floods.

According to the National Flood Commission of India, about 40 per cent Assam’s area – close to 32 lakh hectares – is flood-prone, and therefore, vulnerable to erosion. Of this, around 10 lakh hectares get affected directly and frequently. Each year, an average of 80 sq km is claimed by the Brahmaputra and its 103 tributaries. At any given time in the wet season, 2500 villages and five million people living there are vulnerable.","Wed, 02 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2017/8/2/w600X390/assam_floo8d44.jpg,"['land', 'nuance', 'brahmaputra', 'social', 'problem', 'erosion', 'floods', 'assam', 'sq', 'migrate', 'assams', 'lakh', 'km']",

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma have been informed about this, he said. “The latest flood has been very devastating. Over 50 persons have been killed. More than 200 animals died in Kaziranga National Park. Today morning I saw a picture of a carcass of a tiger, and it just killed me. Our heart is for Assam flood.

44,44,FL-2017-000084-IND,An Eyewitness Account Of Assam Floods That The Media Isn’t Talking About - Youth Ki Awaaz,https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2017/09/flood-ravaged-in-assam-affected-by-the-flood-not-being-a-flood-victim/,"Monsoon in Assam creates moods of both joy and grief for its people.

Being a primarily agricultural state, the farmers of the region are largely dependent on the rains for cultivation. After all, the flood water rejuvenates the agricultural fields through the deposition of fertile silt.

On the other hand, the showers continue for months both in the hills and the valley – which cause the Brahmaputra along with its numerous tributaries to overflow their banks and flood the entire region. This year, 25 districts and more than 33 lakh people have been affected by the floods.

However, unfortunately and unsurprisingly, the issue has failed to grab the headlines. In the national dailies, this issue only finds a neglected corner.

Since my childhood, not a single monsoon has passed without floods being spoken about or heard of. At the local level, media and political parties create a hue and cry to grab a following – but their tune changes once the flood subsides. For them, the issue of flood is a traditional and a seasonal one – and often, the ‘tragedy’ is used to push their agenda. This is what made me curious to visit some flood-affected areas and get a view of the real picture.

Hence, I enrolled as an intern with a local NGO called Jhai Foundation, which specialises in disaster risk-reduction interventions in flood-affected char areas (temporary riverine sandbars or temporary river islands). I got the opportunity to visit the five worst-affected districts – that too during the peak of the devastating flood. I was part of a team to document the traditional flood-coping practices of the affected people.

I started from Majuli, the only river island district in the country – and concluded the two-week-long adventurous journey in a small char village called Mazidbhita in Barpeta district. In those 15 days, I managed to get a glimpse of the harsh reality of the flood-affected areas and its inhabitants.

Most of the villages I visited were regularly affected by annual floods. In fact, the floods hit some of the villages twice or even thrice a year. Regular loss of crops and human lives has rendered the villagers helpless and has dwarfed their socio-economic prospects. They hardly receive any relief or rehabilitation for their losses. In some of the villages, there is a complete absence of any government machinery.

While visiting the second district during our trip, we reached Bhalukaguri – one of the worst-affected villages in Lakhimpur district at dusk. As we could not go inside the village, we had to arrange an interview with the village headman on the road itself.

Mistaking us to be government officials, the village headman asked us to visit his village. He insisted, “Ahise jetia banpani saboi laagibo (As you have come this far, you must witness our plight).”

We requested the local field officer of the disaster management department to accompany us. But, since the administration hadn’t initiated any relief and rehabilitation measures till then, the officer anticipated backlash from the flood-affected tribal people and refused to accompany us.

It showed the anger and hostility of the flood-affected people towards the government. However, once the people discovered that we were independent researchers and not associated with the government, their hostility transformed into warm hospitality. In fact, they even arranged food and drinks for us even under those deplorable conditions.

These villages remain cut off from the outside world for two to three months due to floods every year. The lives of the villagers become so miserable that sometimes they cannot even manage a proper meal, which usually consists of some rice and vegetables (meat or fish or lentils are a far cry in these circumstances). In such cases, they have to be content by consuming only a handful of rice a day.

Often they have to wander to distant, non flood-affected areas in search of hand-pumps, tube-wells or other sources of drinking water. In case they fail to find one, they are forced to resort to drinking flood water.

In many flood-affected villages, we couldn’t find a single toilet. The few villages where toilets had been constructed under the Swachh Bharat Mission were inundated by flood water. It was a traumatising to see that the water bodies where the victims were defecating were also being used as source of drinking water and cooking.

Healthcare in the affected areas is another massive problem for the people. In recent years, science may have made great progress in the field of medicine – but people in these areas are deprived of the benefits of these recent developments. Most of them still follow traditional practices – some of which are effective while the others are quite harmful.

When we enquired about the healthcare facilities in the flood-affected Deorighat village in Dhemaji district, the person replied: “We have our traditional healers. Some of our people also resort to prayers as the primary solution.” They use household remedies like manimuni (Indian pennywort) or amla (Indian gooseberry) in case of stomach problems – and in case of fever, a fried onion paste is applied on the forehead. A strip of chloroquine tablets or a pouch of ORS are luxuries for them, even after 70 years of the country’s independence.

There is a health centre near the village – but the doctor is hardly available during the time of floods. The villagers lamented – “We have even arranged electricity in our health care centre but the doctor always comes up with a new excuse not to come. So our people have lost faith in the primary healthcare centre.” It is not that these people are aversive to modern medical facilities – but they are left with no other option but to rely on their traditional remedies when medical assistance is not easily accessible to them.

Assam boasts of a literacy rate of 73.18% (according to the 2011 census) – but the schools in the flood-affected areas remain suspended for two to three months as they remain submerged under water. In all the villages we visited in the five districts, all the schools had been damaged in some way or the other because of flood or erosion. Moreover, once the flood waters recede, the compensation process takes more than a month due to which the students end up suffering months of academic loss. Even if the school authorities or the state education board may draw up results, declare and promote the students to a higher class, the meaning of education is rendered completely null and void.

While talking to the teenagers about what they wish to do, they gave some interesting replies. Many of them wanted to get into professions like acting, photography, writing, etc. However, they also said that under such circumstances – in which they cannot attend their schools and with the regular loss of agriculture – they are left with no option but to move out of their villages in search of employment to support their families.

Consequently, they mainly work as daily wage labourers or seasonal labourers in glass, car or steel manufacturing industries. During the monsoon season, they migrate from the flood-affected regions to metropolitan areas and return back during winter. Some of them even migrate to far-flung areas like Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi and other cities. Various investigative reports have also found that these flood affected areas are also prominent sites of human trafficking.

My experience in the char villages in Barpeta district was an eye-opener for me. At first glance, I could not distinguish the main course of the river as it had overflowed its banks. The chars are only temporary sandbars which are created over time with the deposition of sediments. However, these are not permanent – and during floods, the water might wipe them out any time.

The people residing in these areas lead a very harsh life—from being regularly displaced to being economically deprived and politically victimised. The government aid in their hours of distress is very minimal. Moreover, the tendency to brand these vulnerable people as ‘illegal Bangladeshi immigrants’ adds to their woes even further. The situation is especially bad for Bengali-speaking Muslims.

However, despite all these stories of suffering and pain, there are some initiatives and interventions by some organisations which gave me some hope. I could figure out that the people of Assam have started to find a way out and become ‘flood-resilient’. In Majuli district, people have started exploring innovative and flood-resilient livelihood options like cage culture for fish farming, ‘floating garden’ for vegetable cultivation, etc. And Jhai Foundation (the organisation I interned with) has been working on creating a model for the development of the char areas – focusing on disaster-resilient shelters, organic homestead gardens and ‘floating classes’ for flood-affected children.

However, the flood situation eased in Assam and northern districts of West Bengal with water receding and no fresh deaths being reported in both the states.

The floods in Bihar has affected 18 districts of the state with around 7.61 lakh people shifted to safer areas. The toll stood at 304 till yesterday with 1.38 crore people battling the deluge.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi would make an aerial survey of flood-affected districts of state on August 26, Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi said.

According to a road construction department a total 203 state highways and other roads under it were damaged in flood waters in different places out of which 95 per cent have been repaired and made motorable.

Araria district accounted for 75 deaths alone, followed by Sitamarhi and West Champaran (36 each), Katihar (26), Kisanganj (23), Madhubani (23), East Champaran, Darbhanga and Madhepura (19 each), Supual (15), Gopalganj (14), Purnea (9) Muzaffarpur (7), Khagaria (6), Saran (6) and Saharsa (4), Sheohar (4), an official said.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar reached Purnea by road from Patna after the helicopter in which he was to travel developed some snag. He inspected some relief camps there, an official accompanying Kumar said.

Kumar would stay at Purnea tonight and would go to Araria, Katihar and Kisanganj tomorrow, the official said.

A total of 1,608 community kitchens were under operation in flood affected areas which served meals to 4.52 lakh people, a state Disaster Management department report said.

Light to moderate rainfall occurred at one or two places in the state since yesterday as the southwest monsoon is getting weak in the state, the MeT department has said.

Jhanjharpur received 4 cm rainfall, while Pusa and Madhwapur received 3 cm each and Thakurganj and Saulighat registered 2 cm of precipitation each.

Gaya recorded the highest maximum temperature of 35.2 degrees Celsius, followed by 35 degrees Celsius at Bhagalpur, 34.8 degrees Celsius in Patna and 33 degrees Celsius in Purnea.

The flood situation in Uttar Pradesh remained alarming with reports of 10 more deaths, taking the toll to 82 in the current wave of deluge in the state.

""The death toll in the floods has reached 82 in the state, where 2,855 villages in 25 districts are inundated affecting a population of over 22 lakh,"" the relief commissioner's office said here citing a flood report compiled till yesterday.

It said that around 50,000 people have taken shelter in relief camps in the affected districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh where there was no let up in flood fury as raging waters of the rivers emanating from Nepal caused havoc in vast swathes of land.

Army choppers, 26 companies of the NDRF, and 30 companies of PAC (flood) jawans continued relief and rescue operations round the clock in the severely hit areas of the floodaffected districts of the state.

However, the flood situation in Assam improved further with the water receding from human habitation and agricultural fields, giving relief to more people in the 12 affected districts of the state.

No fresh deaths due to the deluge were reported and the toll stood at 70, the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) said.

Altogether 11.02 lakh people, against yesterday's 14.36 lakh people, were hit by the floods that have submerged 9,000 hectares of farm fields, it said.

The districts still affected include Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Barpeta, Chirang, Kokrajhar, Dhubri, South Salmara, Goalpara, Morigaon, Nagaon, Golaghat and Majuli.

Water of the Brahmaputra river was still flowing above the danger mark at Nimatighat at Jorhat and Dhubri town, while Dhansiri river is flowing above the danger mark at Numaligarh in Golaghat and Kopili river at Dharamtul in Nagaon district.

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal has requested Union Railway, Transport and Civil Aviation ministers to see that train services were restored at the earliest and smooth movement of goods-laden trucks resumed to ease suffering of flood-affected people.

In view of an alleged inordinate rise in air fares following disruption of train services, the chief minister also requested Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha to maintain ""reasonable fare"" of flights to the Northeast.

The situation in the six-flood hit districts of north Bengal too has improved a lot in the absence of major rainfall and people have started returning to their homes.

There has been no report of any fresh death in the flood-hit six districts of Alipurduar, Jalpaiguri, Coochbehar, North Dinajpur, South Dinajpur and Malda, an official said at the West Bengal secretariat said.

Floods in West Bengal have claimed 152 lives so far and affected around 1.5 crore people.

""Water has started receding from the flood-hit areas in these districts and people are returning home. The situation is improving everyday,"" he said.

The railway link to Assam and the Northeastern region, which was damaged at several places due to floods in Bihar on August 12, is not likely to be repaired soon, with railway authorities here saying that full connectivity cannot be restored before August 28. “As per engineering estimate, full connectivity cannot be restored before August 28.

For passengers travelling from the Northeast to other destinations in India, the railways have provided special trains from Dibrugarh and Guwahati to Dalkhola in North Bengal, from where passengers can travel by road to Raiganj for onward journey, the CPRO said.

“As the track between Dalkhola and Raiganj continues to remain breached (till bridge no 133 is restored) passengers can avail bus service between these two stations which are located close to the four-lane National Highway,” CPRO Sharma said.

By Oneindia Staff Writer

Guwahati, July 18: In any war or disaster (natural or manmade), it is the children and women who face the worst impact of almost all tragedies. It does not mean that men are not vulnerable to difficult situations, but compared to them most of the victims of tragedies are unfortunately women and children.

A similar situation is emerging in flood-hit Assam. As the flood situation in the state continues to remain grim for almost two months, it is the children of the state who are facing the worst effect of it.

Right from the number of children killed in the current wave of floods to displaced kids languishing in relief camps, safety of children remains a major concern till the flood waters don't recede in the northeastern state.

According to reports, the death toll due to floods has risen to 65 on Monday. However, authorities maintain that the flood water is receding in several parts of the state. Unfortunately, the situation is anything but good.

A sizeable number of flood victims are said to be children. As per the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), out of the 65 reported deaths, 23 are below 14 years.

""Of the 65 flood-related deaths in the state so far, 23 are below 14 years. We are collecting data on the affected children,"" the project officer of ASDMA in Guwahati, Rajib Prakash Baruah, told The Telegraph.

However, officials of the ASDMA maintain that they are yet to find out the exact number of women and children being affected by the floods.

Around 4,000 villages, covering more than 25 lakh people in 29 of the state's 33 districts, have been impacted by the floods.

An international NGO which works for children of Assam stated that more than six lakh children have been affected in this year's floods.

""During a natural disaster like flood, children are more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation as their parents remain busy either in managing a shelter or food. Many children drown in floodwaters. Nutritional needs of the newborn, lactating mothers and pregnant women are affected due to lack of proper supply of baby food in relief camps.

Schools get damaged or eroded every year and sometimes remain shut for months, affecting children's education in the long run,"" Chitta Priyo Sadhu, general manager of Save the Children, told The Telegraph.

The NGO is currently distributing relief items to flood-affected children.

""The government agencies and civil society should work out child-specific relief mechanisms so that children are protected, provided proper food and the impact on their education is minimised,"" Sadhu said.

""In 2003, we had launched a project in which child-friendly spaces are facilitated in some relief camps during floods every year. Under it, children are provided both play and study materials.

We engage two facilitators in each centre. In 2014, we trained district disaster management officials in 23 districts on how to ensure child protection. Such child-friendly space can be facilitated by the government in every flood-prone district,"" Deba Prasad Sarma, project co-ordinator of the NGO in Assam, said.

Chiranjeeb Kakoty, director of the Northeast Society for Promotion of Youth and Masses, another NGO, had written to the ASDMA last week, seeking details on the number of flood-affected children, pregnant women and the elderly for specific relief measures.

Ali's house got inundated in the current devastating flood. The flood water of river Beki, a tributary of mighty Brahmaputra, has submerged the earthen floor of his house. The entire family has been living on two elevated beds.

On that fateful day of July 11, Ali's wife Eliza Khatun got up before dawn and went to the nearby jute field on their country boat to attend to nature's call. There is hardly any toilet in the village that can be used and open defecation is the order of the day. Women and adolescent girls have to do it before sunrise. By the time Eliza came back and started preparing breakfast on one corner of the other bed, where her mother-in-law was sleeping, Ali got up and couldn't find his son Injamul on the bed. Injamul was neither on his mother's lap or his grandmother's.

Injamul drowned in the flood water. His dead-body was found under the bed. Just the thought of it brings back sharp memories of the Syrian boy, Alan Kurdi, who lay dead on the shore, face down. But there was nobody to photograph Injamul, or even mourn his death.

This year alone, there have been more than 50 deaths and thousands have been displaced. The numbers are still not enough to hit the collective conscience of the nation. The news of flood in Assam has become monotonous and boring over the years. With abysmally low attention from policy makers and policy advocates, a large percentage of population is turning into climate refugees in Assam. This is happening silently but has dangerous repercussions on socio-economic and political spheres of the state.

Injamul drowned in the flood water. His dead-body was found under the bed.

The intensity of flood and erosion has terribly increased in the last few decades. The weather has become more unpredictable, impact of flood and erosion has been more destructive. Over half a century ago, the magnitude of flood was much lesser and people used to welcome the flood. Writings of travellers and soldiers of the medieval time reveal the story of amazing rivers and awe-inspiring seasonal rains in Assam. Assamese people used these factors to their advantage in their battles against other armies.

But the situation has drastically changed. Experts believe that along with adverse impact of climate change, deforestation, destruction of natural water bodies like beels and haors, short-sighted interventions have created more problems than they could solve.

Sanjay Barbora, the dean of humanities and social sciences at TISS, Guwahati says, ""The propensity to build embankments and dykes with a very short-term economic logic in mind created several unintended consequences that continue to have an adverse impact on the social geography of the Brahmaputra valley.""

Over half a century ago, the magnitude of flood was much lesser and people used to welcome the flood.

He further argues that the construction of embankment has radically altered the social structure of the place and construction of such embankment in one village creates water-logging in the paddy fields of another. Moreover, the breach of embankment causes more loss since the community doesn't remain prepared for the unforeseen disastrous event.

The major casualty caused by flood in recent years in Assam has close links with some of the mindless development projects in the region. Devastation happened in 2004 in Barpeta and adjoining districts due to the release of access water from Kurishu dam in the upstream of river Beki in Bhutan. Those on the side of the downstream didn't have a clue about the imminent disaster and thus couldn't prepare at all.

Rivers of Assam

The floods in 2004 had far reaching impact on human and wildlife in areas including the Manas National Park. The debris carried by flood water blocked and killed a river called Hakura at Mathanguri in Indo-Bhutan border. The water of river Hakura got diverted to Beki which caused over-flowing and widening of river Beki, resulting in heavy erosion and displacement of tens of thousands people.

This year the sudden release of water from NEEPCO's dam over Ranganadi has created havoc in Lakhimpur district. The flood victims allege that the dam authority didn't warn the people about the release of water and the risk of subsequent flooding. An early warning could have saved many lives and properties in the district.

The government sponsored flood control and response measures deployed in Assam are one of the most frustrating things to observe. Every year, in the pre-flood scenario, the government agency concerned build or repair the embankments just before the monsoon which makes these structures extremely vulnerable and often get breached on the first web of flood.

In post flood situation, the agencies wash their hands with distribution of meagre amount of essential commodities like rice, pulse and salt in the relief camps and in some cases fodder and tarpaulin. A government official informed that they have distributed 20 bags (35 Kgs per bag) of fodder among 4,000 farmers as the only flood relief measure!

The news of flood in Assam has become monotonous and boring over the years.

Though India is a signatory in the Sendai Framework, a voluntary and target oriented disaster risk reduction agreement and Assam claims to be the first state to implement it, there is hardly any initiative taken by the responsible agencies to reduce the risk and vulnerability in the flood prone areas of Assam.

Sendai Framework has identified four priority areas for action i.e. i) understanding the disaster risk, ii) strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk, iii) investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience and iv) enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and to ""Build Back Better"" in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction. Unfortunately, we could hardly find any of these in the priority list of the government for action.

Former chief minister of Assam late Sarat Chandra Sinha realised the hollowness of government sponsored flood control and response mechanism and asked the people to learn to co-exist with the flood.

Four decades later, the ""Build Back Better"" concept of Sendai Framework talks about promoting decentralised and participatory approach to reconstruction and best use of local and traditional knowledge and skills. Thus, making the community more resilient towards flood.

Similarly, Early Warning System (EWS) involving key components like risk knowledge, monitoring and warning, dissemination and community response can reduce the vulnerability to a great extent. The Central Water Commission (CWC) has sufficient numbers of gauge water level in the state and monitors the water level on hourly basis during the flood prone monsoon season. But the readings never reach the vulnerable communities who need the information most.

In our neighbouring country Nepal, the development agencies are tapping traditional and local knowledge to build successful community-based early flood warning system.

In Bangladesh, an initiative called 'Char Livelihood Programme' has been one of the best interventions to eradicate extreme poverty in the flood and erosion affected char or river island areas of Bangladesh using traditional knowledge and taping local resources.

Considering the impact of climate change, deforestation and destruction of natural water reservoirs, there is little doubt that the intensity of flood and erosion will continue to strike in Assam for coming years too. Our response to flood and erosion need a paradigm shift in terms of control and response.

Though we are blessed with inspiring people like Jadav Payeng, who promotes afforestation as a flood and erosion control mechanism but our government seems to be not interested in investing on communities to build their capacity to reduce the disaster risks using traditional knowledge and skills.

They'd rather be busy in building non-sustainable embankments, porcupines and distribution of flood relief in quantities that many would term inhumane.

50,50,FL-2017-000084-IND,Over 300 animals have died in Assam’s “worst flood in 30 years” - Condé Nast Traveller India,https://www.cntraveller.in/story/300-animals-died-assams-worst-flood-30-years/,"Monsoon floods are essential to Kaziranga’s ecosystem: its vast grasslands and beels (wetland lakes) are annually revitalised by the mighty Brahmaputra’s overflow. But this year’s floods have caused a severe crisis for wildlife. If the 2016 floods were ‘the worst to hit Kaziranga in a decade’, the floods this year are probably the worst in 30 years. Over 85 percent of the park is inundated, displacing thousands of animals. And hundreds of creatures–including tigers, rhinos, elephants, wild buffaloes and hog deer–have died in the past two months.

Wildlife is also affected due to the increased human presence around the fringes of the national park. The typical behaviour of wild animals as Kaziranga gets inundated is to seek higher ground towards the Karbi Anglong Hills. But when their traditional corridors of movement are intersected by roads or human settlements, it makes their exodus more difficult. Having to cross human-dominated areas makes animals more vulnerable to vehicular accidents and poaching, and increases the possibility of human-wildlife conflict.

This isn’t to say that people living on the outskirts of Kaziranga are necessarily antagonistic towards wildlife. The Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC), the facility I work with, is a unique wildlife rescue, treatment and rehabilitation facility jointly run by Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and the Assam Forest Department near Kaziranga. It has regularly conducted pre-flood awareness activities with local communities and found them to be refreshingly tolerant towards wildlife at most times.

Despite being in distress themselves, villagers had kept a watch on the rhino calf through the night. Despite being in distress themselves, villagers had kept a watch on the rhino calf through the night.



In fact, one of the emergency rescues I attended earlier this month with CWRC’s Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS) team involved a displaced rhino calf, just about a week old and with its umbilical cord still attached, which had found its way into the backyard of a flood-affected home in the Haladhibari area on the fringes of Kaziranga. Despite being in distress themselves, villagers had kept a watch on the calf through the night and were happy to assist the forest department and the MVS team when we arrived to rescue it.

This was on August 13, a day when four rhino calves were rescued and brought to CWRC’s Large Animal Nursery within just 24 hours! In all, our MVS teams across Assam comprising veterinarians and animal keepers have attended close to a hundred wildlife emergency cases over the two phases of floods in July and August, working in concert with the forest department.

Seven rhino calves have been rescued from the floods thus far in 2017. Dr Panjit Basumatary, the lead veterinarian at CWRC, informs me that the first four weeks post-rescue are the most challenging since the calves are stressed due to the trauma of their experience and of course, the separation from their mothers. While five of the six calves rescued this month have been stabilised, Panjit tells me, one remains in an agitated state.

Of course, rescuing and providing emergency care for displaced animals is just one aspect of what our teams do, since large mammals like rhinos and elephants–and there are currently 28 orphaned elephant and rhino calves under care at CWRC–will require years of dedicated hand-raising! The real journey begins now, and we’re going to need your help in successfully rehabilitating these animals back into the wild.

Suresh and Bina Saroh’s son, now 6, survived fever and diarrhoea after their village, Sildubi Borbeel Mising Gaon near Kaziranga National Park, was inundated in 2012. They lost their second son in a similar situation last year. The baby named Ajay, meaning invincible, was barely three months old.

Bina, 29, is pregnant again. And she knows she is not in the right place — a cramped relief camp for the flood-affected — to be with child.

“One can tolerate the heat and humidity in this tin-roofed camp (No 1 Hatikhuli Tea Estate Lower Primary School), but sharing one toilet with 247 others is tough,” Bina said. The school has two toilets, but one has been locked, forcing the inmates to dent the BJP-led coalition government’s avowed achievement of making Assam open-defecation free.

“We are trying to ensure health care and some degree of comfort for Bina and 10 lactating mothers who have been in this relief camp for more than a week. The conditions are tough for them,” anganwadi worker Jyotemoye Rajkhowa told HT.

The camp has no provision to filter iron-heavy groundwater drawn from a tube-well in the school complex. Officials said water purifying tablets are being provided to offset possible diseases. Bina and the lactating mothers are lucky that the school has an anganwadi centre attached, where ASHA (Accredited

Social Health Activist) worker Gayatri Tanti attends to them besides half a dozen children suffering from fever.

The inmates are fortunate too that the camp is on National Highway 715 and adjoins the Kaziranga National Park. The attention the wildlife preserve gets during floods, spills over.

The daily flood update from the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) has no break-up of male and female inmates in the 279 relief camps and relief distribution centres. As of Saturday evening, these had 24,423 inmates.

Estimates from field officials say a tenth of the women in these camps are either pregnant or lactating. Their condition is said to be sub-human in the worst hit districts such as Lakhimpur and South Salmara.

“We are trying our best to provide relief materials to the remotest of relief camps. In places such as Majuli (island), I have asked officials to make a list of people who lost everything so that we can help them rebuild,” chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal said. “We have adequate money and the Prime Minister has assured more assistance,” he added.","Sun, 16 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2017/07/16/Pictures/hatikhuli-karmakar-relief-please-kaziranga-details-received_2c238ff2-6a4e-11e7-ae46-9bfe7bf72e96.jpg,"['officials', 'relief', 'camp', 'bina', 'pregnant', 'kaziranga', 'crammed', 'tough', 'floods', 'assam', 'national', 'inmates', 'women', 'school', 'mothers', 'lactating', 'camps', 'struggle']",

While we were celebrating India's 70th Indpendence Day, a heartfelt picture went viral on social media. The photograph has a man, a seemingly teen and two kids saluting the tricolour as it unfurls, all of them marooned in water. Both the children's shoulders were barely above water. Many shared and liked this picture as a mark of patriotism while few others were stirred by the grim situation of flood.

The photograph was shared over a lakh of times on Facebook and forwarded via WhatsApp. The viral snap is from Assam's Dhubri where a teacher and students are marking the celebration of India's 70th Independence Day by hoisting the flag. The picture was shared on Facebook by Mizanur Rahman who is an assistant teacher in Naskara LP school under Fakirganj Police station of Dhubri. While talking to BBC Hindi, Mizanur said, he didn't expect such an overwhelming response to the picture. He sayd that electricity is a rare phenomemon in the area, hence after clicking the picture, she switched off the phone. It was only in the evening that he came to know about the extent the picture has gone viral.

Mizanur said that events at government school has to be documented and sent to Education department, hence, the picture was taken. Moreover, students seen in the image can swim. Later in a Facebook post, Mizanur wrote, ""It is very tough for me to figure out the right way to thank you all for supporting me and making my effort to be rightly executed to the world.

Severe flooding has devastated communities and destroyed crops in India, Nepal and Bangladesh, with NGOs warning of food shortages and the risk of disease.

In Bangladesh, where the floods are thought to be the most severe in 100 years, more than a third of the country has been submerged. Najibullah Hameem, chief of field office for the UN children’s agency, Unicef, in Bangladesh, told the Guardian on Monday that water levels are now going down, but that aid workers are running out of crucial supplies needed to protect communities from disease. At least 115 people have died and more than 5.7 million are affected.

“The need is huge and our resources are limited. We cannot respond to all of what people require in this situation,” he said. “[Agencies had made plans based] on last year, when the flood was not serious like this. We had not expected the number of communities that are currently affected.”

Last week, most government departments had run out of medicines and items such as jerry cans, tarpaulin and water purification tablets. Supplies have since been replenished, but are still short of demand.

Survivors of the flood are returning to find their homes destroyed, Hameem said. “In terms of water level the situation is improving but there might be rain again, and if so the waters will go up again. They need to repair their houses – some are completely washed out. We are expecting more medical issues and disease.”

Unicef is trying to collect information on children affected by the floods, who may have been separated from their families, or be at risk of drowning and snakebites. In four of the districts most severely affected, all schools are closed, leaving children unable to finish their exams, which are held over the summer months.

Mark Pierce, country director for Save the Children in Bangladesh, warned that the central and southern areas of the country now face devastation as flood waters flow from the north.

“An enormous volume of water has to pass through the country, and people need to take care, stay away from flood waters and evacuate their homes as necessary. The humanitarian situation remains extremely serious and will be for some time.



“The sheer scale of this crisis means there still isn’t enough food or clean drinking water. More than half a million homes have been damaged while over 400,000 hectares of farmland was destroyed. We’re doing all we can to help, but much more assistance is urgently needed,” said Pierce.

In the Indian state of Assam, which borders Bangladesh, at least 180 people have been killed in the past few weeks. “With the floods washing away everything … there is not even a trace of our small thatched hut,” said Lakshmi Das, a mother of three, living in Kaliabor, Assam.



“We do not even have a second pair of clothes to wear. The government is not providing any aid.”

Ravikant Upadhyay, team leader of Assam flood response for Care India, said communities have been devastated. “The embankment of rivers in many areas have been breached, forcing over 400 families to stay in extremely unhygienic conditions. Most people have lost everything including important documents. Schools are submerged under eight feet of water. Overall, the flood survivors are very worried and in dire need of support,” he said.

In the eastern Indian state of Bihar, at least 253 people lost their lives. Heavy rains have destroyed crops, roads and disrupted power supplies.

Thomas Chandy, CEO of Save the Children in India, warned of a secondary health crisis as flood waters began to retreat in some areas.

“Even though we’re seeing flood waters receding in some parts, it provides little respite as the mammoth recovery operation is only just beginning,” Chandy said.

“One of the big challenges is preventing potential outbreaks of disease like cholera or diarrhoea, which is an increased risk at this time. A lot of water sources have been contaminated by the floods, and many children are living in damp conditions that are conducive to getting sick.”

In Nepal, 141 people are confirmed dead, while more than 38,000 households have been severely affected by floods.

Madhav P Dhakal, response and recovery coordinator for Care Nepal, said the NGO is handing out “dignity kits” (hygiene and sanitary materials for women), ready-to-cook food and water purifiers. “All the water taps were completely covered by the flooded water, so there is a big need for water purifiers,” he said.



Aid workers are also providing health education and running health camps to prevent disease outbreaks. Dhakal added: “Mosquito nets are in high need because of the water level in the areas and high chances of malaria and other mosquito bites communicable diseases. Symptoms of skin diseases, eye problems and fevers have been recorded among the flood-affected people.”

The heavy rains have also hit Kaziranga national park in India’s Assam state. The park hosts two-thirds of the world’s population of endangered Indian one-horned rhinoceroses.

On Independence Day, a photo of children saluting the national flag standing in chest-deep flood waters at a school in Dibru district of Assam went viral. While many hailed it as a reflection of true patriotism, others – especially on social media – emphasised the worsening living conditions of people in the flood-hit area. After the photo went viral, the Internet was filled with similar pictures of people celebrating Independence in the north-east. But now, there is another photo that is going viral, and the last thing it is, is celebratory.

Uploaded on a Facebook page called The Voice of North East India, it has a girl holding a placard with a message written in capital letters — “Mumbai: Rainfall; full media coverage, Assam: Floods every year, death of hundreds of people; nobody cares. And we live in a society where we have at least 30 24*7 news channels who can show your horoscope but not the HORROR OF ASSAM.” The fact that the photo is from June 2015 and keeps resurfacing, went viral again this year, in the aftermath of the devastating floods the state has been seeing. Unfortunately, the connect still stands.

Though there are few who will contest the sentiment, social media has provided a platform for people from that region to have their voices heard.

This is the Facebook post.

Meanwhile, it is also true that rainfall in Mumbai garners a lot of attention mostly due to the badly constructed roads that cave in and give way to potholes at this time. This year, RJ Maliksha Mendoza’s satire song directed at Shiv Sena (which controls the Bombay Municipal Corporation) went viral after the civic body’s lack of interest in the issue. This is in spite of how the alarming increase in the number of potholes after the rains lead to many people losing their lives as well, including a toddler and Jagruti Hogale, a biker.","Tue, 29 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/assam-floods_1.jpg,"['girl', 'gone', 'floodhit', 'viral', 'going', 'east', 'assam', 'north', 'thing', 'true', 'voice', 'media', 'went']",

Monsoon rains have lashed western and eastern India, leaving several states fighting to contain the flood fury that has affected thousands and killed hundreds.

The situation remains critical in Gujarat, prompting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take an aerial survey of his home state on Tuesday to assess the damage.

Mayank Rawal, a senior official in the disaster management department in Ahmedabad, Gujarat’s main city, said more than 10,000 people had been moved to higher ground, including 1,000 who were airlifted to safety.

Air force helicopters were carrying out sorties to drop food packets to those stranded.

L.B. Bambhaniya, administrator of flood-ravaged Banaskantha district in Gujarat, said 350 villages had been waterlogged, hitting cotton and groundnut crops.

“I am worried about the damage to the fields... We will have to provide financial support to farmers,” Bambhaniya told Reuters.

In neighboring Rajasthan, a usually arid state, six people were killed in three flood-hit districts.

In India’s eastern state of West Bengal, more than 25,000 people were forced from their homes due to the rains and sudden discharge of water from several dams in neighboring Jharkhand.

West Bengal’s irrigation minister, Rajiv Banerjee, said the Jharkhand government must immediately stop releasing water from dams to prevent water-logging.

“Agriculture was severely hit by the flooding,” he told Reuters.

The waters were receding in northeast India, where at least 105 people had lost their lives due to floods and landslides in the past month that had hit 60 districts across Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Manipur states.

Efforts were under way to drain stagnant water from a national park in Assam that is home to the world’s largest concentration of one-horned rhinoceroses.

Assam Relief and Rehabilitation Minister Keshab Mahanta said the government had launched a massive clean-up to prevent the outbreak of disease.

“Relief and rescue operations are going on in a war footing in the flood ravaged areas,” Mahanta told Reuters.

Outbreaks of diseases such as dengue fever are often a threat in the aftermath of floods. Dengue is transmitted by mosquitoes that breed in stagnant water.

A dengue outbreak killed 23 people in the southern state of Kerala in July, a government official said, adding that more than 12,000 people had been infected since May.

58,58,FL-2017-000084-IND,How residents of Assam’s vulnerable sandbar villages saved themselves from this year’s floods - Scroll.in,https://scroll.in/article/847406/how-residents-of-assams-vulnerable-sandbar-villages-saved-themselves-from-this-years-floods,"Living on the chars or sandbars on the mighty Brahmaputra and its fast tributaries isn’t easy. But this year was different for some villagers on a small islet called Tapajuli Pathar in Assam’s Barpeta district. For the first time in many years, Amirjan Khatun and her neighbours in Tapajuli Pathar have survived the annual flood without their houses being destroyed.

This is despite the fact that this year’s flood in Assam has been particularly severe. In the Barpeta district alone, 26 villages and more than 7,000 people have be badly hurt by the floods till a few days ago.

Floods occur with depressing regularity in Assam. This year has been as disastrous as ever, already claiming 84 lives and affecting more than 1.7 million people. Most often, the first areas to be flooded are the chars, or small river islands, found on the Brahmaputra and its tributaries.

There are over 2,000 chars in Assam, with an estimated three million people living on them. With about 68% of the char dwellers living in abject poverty, the floods have a devastating impact on their lives and livelihoods.

The elders in the char villages say that the nature of the floods has changed in the past three decades. Earlier, they could predict the timing and could take precautions. In recent times, they have had to move to government relief camps on higher ground during floods. The tiny camps of about 60 sq ft are woefully inadequate to house entire villages.

Mitigating measure

“This year too our area was flooded for a few weeks, but thankfully we could stay at home without being affected,” Amirjan told VillageSquare.in. This near-miracle has been made possible for Amirjan and her neighbours because of an innovation called plinth raising, which entails constructing a high earthen platform on which to build a house.

In this method, earth from nearby areas is used to raise the ground level. These platforms are raised to a height of at least three feet above the level of the previous year’s flood. The earth is compacted and grass is immediately planted on the slopes of the platform to hold the soil together. The villagers are encouraged to start vegetable gardens on the platforms and grow banana trees on the slight slope of the platforms to prevent soil erosion.

Life is hard

Most people in Tapajuli Pathar have lost their land to floods and erosion in the last few decades. They have ended up working as daily wage earners in nearby towns or in others’ farmland. “The financially sound families have left the place to buy land in other places,” rued 40-year-old Rahmat Ali, who lost his house and property twice in the last five years. “Some have shifted to stay with their relatives permanently.”

“I have seen enormous suffering of the char dwellers. To arrive at a solution, I even went to Bangladesh to study how they tackled the flood situation,” Abdul Kalam Azad, secretary of Jhai Foundation that initiated the plinth-raising measure under the Char Development Programme, told VillageSquare.in.

Surveys were conducted to get a better understanding of the problems faced by the char villages. The solution of raising the plinth was arrived at after a series of discussions involving dwellers, teachers, government officials, local administrators, experts and academia.

Choosing households

The participants in the programme were selected during the meetings, based primarily on their economic status. “Char Development Programme is not just about dealing with the floods, but also about bringing a positive change,” said Zahedul Islam, a development worker. “We ensured that the beneficiaries did not practice child marriage and child labour.” Other factors taken into consideration included whether a family was headed by a woman – a widow in most cases – or whether the family had members with special needs or if they sent their daughters to school.

Based on these criteria, 50 families were selected from the badly affected Mazidbhita, No 4 Bhera and Balikuri chars, besides Tapajuli Pathar on Beki River, one of the major tributaries of Brahmaputra.

The project began in 2016. Jhai Foundation spent some Rs 4.5 lakh to raise the plinths of 50 houses at an average of Rs 9,000 each. The families contributed labor.

Life on raised plinths

“The plinth-raising has changed our lives,” said 33-year-old Amirjan. “Last year we had to take refuge in others’ houses. This year we have our own home. Four of our children are going to school. My husband has been able to go to Kerala for work, since he doesn’t have to worry about us during the floods.”

“Earlier we had to move to a relief camp. I couldn’t grow any vegetables; all would perish in the flood. But this time, I grew them on the plinth. Most importantly, my pregnant daughter-in-law didn’t have to suffer sanitation and health problems during the flood,” Rong Bahar, a 65-year-old widow, told VillageSquare.in.

“This plinth-raising has made the char dwellers aware of the corrupt practices in government works,” said Kalam. “The villagers estimate that the same earth-filling work under a government scheme would have cost Rs 15 to 20 lakh because of corruption at various levels.”

Floating school

The schools in these areas were always closed during the floods. The village kids have now special floating classes aboard a boat stationed at Tapajuli Pathar. Every day, Jahidul Baig teaches 45 kids of different ages. “We are lucky not to miss classes this year during the flood,” said Anjuwara, a Class 6 student.

Though the floodwaters have receded and schools have reopened, the classes on the boat continue. “We started it in this locality six months back to help the students, besides their regular classes. And it proved to be a great help during the flood as the schools were closed for more than a month,” Jahidul Baig, the teacher, told VillageSquare.in.

The Char Development Programme will now be extended to other char villages. The community mobilisation for raising the plinths of houses has inspired an equal number of economically capable families to raise the plinths of their houses on their own.

Assam sees an annual onslaught of floods, which wipe away lives and homes. But the river, also known as the Luit, continues to flow — blatantly and nonchalantly. This year’s deluge left at least 85 people dead and over 5 lakh homeless. The Centre released Rs 250 crore for relief and rehabilitation work. And the saga continues, year after year.Nestled deep within the state, in the Brahmaputra, is the shrinking 400-odd sq km island of Majuli. As the river continues to disfigure the island, the tag of the “largest river island in the world” stands on precarious ground, just like the island itself. Majuli saw much political fanfare last year, with Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal winning the assembly election from the island constituency.Lesser known, however, is that the island is the cultural nerve-centre of Assam because of the Vaishnavite monasteries, also known as satras, which adhere to the teachings of 15th century reformer Srimanta Sankardev. With flood and erosion hitting the island hard year after year, of the 65 original satras only 22 remain; and even their future remains uncertain.(In Pic- Young disciples ahead of the Raas festival)The origin of the satras goes back to the late 15th century when the Vaishnavite saint Shankardev brought about a movement of religious and social reform in Assam based on Vaishnava teachings. Shankardev developed this movement of getting people together from different castes and creeds for intellectual teachings and discussions. Through theatre, dance and literature, this was an effort to bring the common people together to understand the religious context of peace and tranquility.(In Pic- Bhaonas are traditional and dramatic forms of entertainment based on Vaishnav teachings)Of the 800-odd satras in Assam, Shankardev began with the 65 in Majuli. Over the years, these art forms have evolved and are still being preserved in these satras. The monks or bhakats take active part in the propagation and development of the varied art forms. Slowly and gradually, these art forms started spreading out of Majuli as the bhakats started to settle down in towns and cities and began teaching these forms to men as well as women.Almost 15 km from where the ferry docks in Kamalabari is the Samaguri Satra, the world-renowned mask-making monastery. The mask or mukha was a key component in the theatrical performances initiated by Shankardev — it had a role in conflating the theatrical with the spectacular.(In Pic- Congregational prayers using khol (drum), taal (cymbals), flute and conch shells are deep-rooted in the satras )“We are carrying on the tradition of mask-making passed on by our forefathers,” says Khagen Goswami, a curator of the satra. Used in theatrical performances called bhaonas, these masks are used to capture emotions and expressions not possible for a face to depict.Established in 1663, the Samaguri Satra has taken the lead in the production of these dramatic masks and are being bequeathed to the interested youth of today. Currently, 15 students are learning the art form in the satra. “We impart the skills for free and in the end we give certificates under the banner of the ‘Guru-Shishya Programme’ of the Government of India,” Goswami adds. “Our masks have also been exported to places like Israel, France and the UK.”(In Pic- Dance and music are an integral part of a disciple’s education at the satras )Shankardev introduced the form of dancedramas or bhaona to convey cultural messages to the people through entertainment. This forms one of the core activities of the Auniati Satra, established in 1653. This satra is seen as a symbol of the bhaona, or Ankiya Naats. Bhaonas narrate religious stories and the contents of Srimad Bhagwat Purana and the Ramayana to the devotees. This mode of expression was more engrossing, involving, entertaining and made the narrative easily comprehensible. Another major contribution of the satras is the Sattriya dance, which is synonymous with Majuli. Within the satras, this art form integrated with music and dance, and is taught to young disciples.Satra is one of the few places where the tradition of guru-disciple tradition still exists. It follows the hierarchy of satra-adhikar, deka-adhikar, bhakat and shisya. “We go out in search of young boys so that we can impart the knowledge that we learned from our gurus,” says Nitul Dutta, a bhakat of the Auniati Satra. “These kids generally come from economically backward families. We help them integrate with the monastery’s family unit, comprising of monks of different generations, for life. When they grow up, they will in turn welcome a novice to impart the same values.” The bhakats and pupils stay in dormitories known as boha, and cultivate the art forms through congregational prayers, art and literature.A unique aspect of the arts nurtured at the satras is that they are part of a living cultural tradition. Commanding strict devotion, many satras require a commitment from the members that they will be celibate monks.With an estimated population of 1,60,000 people, Majuli is a brand new district of Assam. But nothing much has changed. “Every year it’s the same mess. CM or no CM, our annual struggle continues,” rants Tapan Kalita, a local fisherman at Kamalabari village of Majuli.The cultural and religious segment creates a possibility for developing tourism on the river island. But that can be seen only for four-five months, between September and January.Come Janmashthami and the satras gear up for a season of putting its best cultural foot forward. Be it the Ankiya Naats, Paal naam, Raas or bhaonas, the season sees an overflow of tourists from the world over. But for a major part of the year, activities come to a halt because of the recurring floods. In the last concerted effort to keep the age-old traditions alive, few of the satras are shifting out of Majuli to other places like Jorhat, Sivsagar, Nagaon and Lakhimpur. “We have to continue the legacy left behind by Shankardev,” says Naren Kataki of the Dakhinpat Satra, “and for that we must take the flood-prone satras to better and safer places.”“We cannot let the heritage set by the great Shankardev deteriorate just like that. Efforts are on to protect and promote the culture of the satras,” says CM Sonowal, adding that Rs 1,500 crore has been sanctioned for the development of the satras, not only for those on Majuli but across the state. He also added that Rs 218 crore has been set apart by the Ministry for Development of North Eastern Region, for the development of the river island. “We only get a window of five-six months during the winter to work on our developmental projects. Efforts are on to build the second bridge stretching from Sivasagar in upper Assam, connecting the island to the rest of the state. We are also working on projects to promote green ecosystem on the island.”Majuli is also in the tentative list of Unesco’s World Heritage Sites. “We have a sense of calm here which is required for our meditation and rehearsals. A Unesco tag might lead to commercialisation of our culture. But I’m sure the government knows better. Taking our culture and our creativity to the outside world should be a positive move,” says Dutta of the Auniati Satra.The disheartening state of affairs is such that original artefacts, weapons, attires and relics of the Ahom rulers of Assam are stored in a dingy, dark outbuilding in the Dakhinpat Satra. “With no help from any source, what do you expect us to do?” shrugs a visibly irked Kakati, the caretaker of the makeshift ‘museum’.The towering presence of the Brahmaputra reflects the ambiguity in the nebulous contours of Majuli. As American singer Paul Robeson famously quipped:Dat ol ’ man river, He mus ’ know sumpin’But don’t say nuthin ’ , He jes ’ keeps rollin’He keeps on rollin’ along”Bhupen Hazarika's tribute to the Brahmaputra Bistirno Parore draws comparison with these lines by Robeson. Nonetheless, as the Luit keeps rolling, for the people of the island who depend on the river for their livelihood and their very existence, it is a constant struggle for survival.","Sun, 03 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-60340100,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-64530,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg","['island', 'majuli', 'eroding', 'forms', 'satra', 'cultural', 'satras', 'floods', 'shankardev', 'assam', 'centre', 'nerve', 'assams', 'art', 'river']",

More than 100 people have died in northeastern parts of India and tens of thousands have been displaced by the floods which have submerged villages, washed away vast tracts of farmland and destroyed roads and bridges.

But the Red Cross said the spread of water- and vector- borne diseases was a concern as water levels begin to fall in some parts of Assam and Manipur states, and people in government relief camps return to their homes in low-lying areas.

“Ongoing heavy rain and a third wave of flooding continues to submerge villages in both states and bring misery and desperation,"" said Vijay Kumar Ummidi from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in India.

“But in some districts, floodwaters are starting to recede, exposing damaged toilets, contaminated water sources and standing water that is certain to attract more mosquitoes,"" he said in a statement late on Thursday.

Red Cross workers added that they were already recording an increase in diseases in Manipur state which borders Myanmar.

“We are already seeing a rise in cases of malaria, Japanese encephalitis and other vector-borne diseases, as well as infections from unsafe drinking, cooking and bathing water,"" said Amul Kumar from the Indian Red Cross in Manipur.

Monsoon rains from June to September are vital for its agriculture, which makes up 18% of its gross domestic product (GDP) and provides employment for almost half its 1.3 billion population.

But in many states, the rains frequently cause rivers such as the Brahmaputra and their tributaries to overflow and flooding forces millions into temporary camps, destroys homes and exposes people to diseases such as malaria and diarrhoea.

Torrential rains this year have disrupted the lives of around 2 million people in the oil- and tea-rich state of Assam alone. Many remain in camps or makeshift shelters along river banks. Some are returning to their ruined homes and crops.

The Red Cross said people required basic aid ranging from tarpaulins and soap to kitchen utensils as well as temporary toilets, water treatment and storage systems, disinfectants and mosquito nets.

“The needs are enormous, so we are focusing on the health and wellbeing of the poorest of the poor, those who have lost everything, and single moms, the elderly and other vulnerable people who are truly struggling to get by,"" said Ummidi. Reuters

With 26 districts in Assam and several parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Manipur affected by flood; various NGOs, corporate groups, netizens groups and governmental organisations are coming forward to help.

The Assam disaster management authority on Thursday evening reported that 382 relief camps are being opened in the state with around 29,000 living in those camps.

While the national media’s apathy towards the grim situation where more than 60 deaths were recorded was bashed by citizens, e-commerce major Amazon came forward to help the victims in a noble manner.

Calling for voluntary help, Amazon India on its popular homepage wrote: Help Assam. Donate For Flood Relief In Northeast.

“Northeast has been hit by devastating floods triggered by incessant rains. Lakhs of people have been affected and are living in relief camps. Amazon is working with implementation partners and state/national disaster coordination committees to support those affected by the flood. We believe that with your support, we can play an important role in mitigating the effects of the disaster and provide immediate relief to victims,” a dedicated campaign page noted.

The e-commerce major enlisted three NGOs whom anyone can donate for relief activities. The NGOs included Goonj, Habitat for Humanity India and Oxfam India.

Goonj is focused on reaching essential supplies to the flood-hit people in Northeast as a part of its ‘Rahat – Floods’ efforts whereas, Habitat for Humanity is working in Northeast and targets to provide 10,000 emergency shelter kits. Oxfam India is working on ground in the flood-hit states of Northeast India and aims to provide critical relief to affected families and communities.

Amazon India enlisted cash donation options of the NGOs and also created a category of items from where one can order and get the items delivered to the NGOs through Amazon. The NGOs will in turn distribute them among the needy.

Express News Service

MAJULI: For these river people, the floods every year make their “sang ghars” (stilts) worthwhile.

The Mishings (tribesmen) dwell along major rivers in Assam and the plains of neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh. The flood this year in the river island of Majuli, which is now a full-fledged district, had left a trail of devastation.

However, the houses of Nirmal Lagachu and scores others stood safe on stilts.

Stilts or sang ghars are built on a high rise platform and they are an integral part of the Mishings. They are made of bamboo, cane and hay but there is now an increasing trend to erect them on concrete pillars. A stilt has everything – bedrooms, drawing room, kitchen, toilet etc.

In the wee hours of July 10, the flooded Subansiri waters made way through a “dead river” Kherkota at a place some 20 km from Majuli district headquarters Garmur, and washed away a dozen concrete houses besides silting vast swathes of paddy fields. But houses that are stilts survived.

The Kherkota died in the late 1950s, locals said. The Mishings say they build the stilts to get respite from floods, diseases and dirt.Nirmal, her brother, nodded his head in agreement.

“The Mishings are not used to living in houses with the floor on the ground. They rear pigs and chickens which litter the compound. By living on sang ghars, they can get away from the dirt,” he says as his wife weaves a mekhela (saree) in rapt attention.

Ramesh Taid, a teacher at the Selek Sera Buk Lower Primary School, says the Mishings by nature are “dirty people” and as such, they live in stilts. The raised platform helps them to throw the dirt away.

Nipen Kaman, president of students’ body Takam Mishing Porin Kebang, says the Mishings build sang ghars as they are poor. Moreover, these are the traditional abodes of the tribe, he says.

Pigs moving around sang ghars is common. There will not be a single Mishing family that does not rear pigs and chickens.

“Pigs are a part of our lives. On any occasion – be it the death of a person, the birth of a kid, a puja, marriage or whatever, the guests are to be fed with pork. If not, they will feel offended,” says Rana.

Marriages are impossible if the couple bears the same surname. In case there is any through elopement, they guilty will be hunted down, separated or may even be killed.The Mishings are mostly cultivators and a backward people. In Assam, they are largely settled in Majuli and its neighbouring North Lakhimpur and Dhemaji districts. In the Sarbananda Sonowal ministry, there is just one Mishing, sports minister Naba Kumar Doley.

Meanwhile, the 40-year-old Nirmal, a peasant, lost 14 bighas of land to siltation. With the land gone, he says he will try and eke out a living by becoming a daily wage earner.The floods disrupted communication at the Notun Sapori village, which has some 100 households, by washing away a portion of a bridge.

The locals are building an alternative bridge near the damaged portion with bamboo.Majuli deputy commissioner (district magistrate), Pallav Gopal Jha, told the New Indian Express that around 60,000 of the district’s 1.83 lakh population got affected by the floods. He said school children marooned were aided with books and bags. Mishings make up some 48 per cent of the island’s population.

“There was a sudden increase in the water levels of rivers and people were caught unawares. Fifty three revenue villages got affected. Siltation occurred at a number of agricultural fields,” Jha said.

Majuli has got reduced to one third of its original size in the past 100 years. So, where does the DM see the island 50 years from now? Soil erosion, caused by the Brahmaputra, is a serious problem. A lot of protection works have been planned and researches are going on. In the next 50 years, science and technology will develop accordingly and given the kind of attention Majuli is getting, I think it will be protected,” Jha says.","Tue, 08 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2017/7/26/w600X390/Assam_Flood-AP.jpg,"['majuli', 'houses', 'save', 'mishing', 'tribesmen', 'ghars', 'floods', 'assam', 'mishings', 'stilts', 'sang', 'living', 'express', 'indian', 'river']",

In Nepal, incessant rain has flooded hundreds of villages leaving 110 people dead. The government has come under fire for not responding fast enough to the disaster.

As security forces scrambled to rescue those marooned on rooftops and helicopters distributed food and water to the worst-hit districts yesterday, the home ministry spokesman Ram Krishna Subedi said relief supplies were being mobilised as soon as possible. Elephants were deployed to help rescue those stranded following three days of torrential rain, including 700 tourists in the popular town of Chitwan.

An action that went on to save the lives of 30 villagers.

When the flood hit, Pinki Gogoi and Puja Gogoi set out on their handmade bamboo raft, using rafting skills which they had picked up in their childhood, to rescue the vulnerable villagers left stranded. Some of them were standing in waist-high water, which was rising while they were unable to move.

The flood happened early in the morning in Hatilung village in Upper Assam’s Lakhimpur district, catching many people off guard. By 6am, Telegraph India reported that the waters had covered the village trees by 3 feet, and many backyards had been submerged.

Many locals had just enough time to gather their belongings, and carrying all they could in bags on their head, began to wade through the waters in search of safe grounds.

As many sought safety for themselves and their families, Pinki’s father Shishu Ram and brother Nipon had already begun to set up tents in safe evacuation zones nearby, ready to offer shelter to those rescued by the girls.

“Four to five people can get onto a plantain raft. I saw Mridu aunty and Sarumai aunty dangerously wading and so I asked them to get on our raft. It is always safe to sit on the raft as it helps to maintain balance in the current,” Pinki told Telegraph India.

Promotion

The Lakhimpur district is highly susceptible to flooding, and the village in which the two girls live has seen the devastation left behind by floods in the past., “Although we don’t have floods every year, she (Pinki) was witness to the severe floods in 2008 and the people’s sufferings. This probably encouraged her to help others this time,” Pinki’s father continued.

This flood was caused by water from Ranganadi dam in Arunachal Pradesh breaching the embankment that protects villages like Hatilung, Bogolijan and Boalmari.

The girls’ quick-thinking and bravery has many already calling on the local government to honour them with bravery awards. “Both deserve awards for the courage and bravery they showed during an emergency and for saving lives. We plan to felicitate them and will write to Chief Minister, Sarbananda Sonowal, and Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, to confer bravery awards on them,” Freedom Fighter Phaniram Das Foundation founder, Bikash Kumar Das, reported to Telegraph India.

NEW DELHI: Floods in Bihar claimed 32 more lives while 2 persons were killed in Uttar Pradesh even as the situation improved in the eastern states of Assam and West Bengal following less rainfall today.

In Odisha, heavy rains, triggered by a low pressure, disrupted normal life in many parts today causing a flood-like situation in three districts.

In Kalahandi, Malkangiri and Nabarangpur districts incessant rains caused several rivers to be in spate and inundate over six villages and snap the road links, officials said.

Kalahandi Collector A K Manik said a 10-foot breach in the Indravati left canal, near Ranibahal, led to the inundation of some villages.

There was a flood-like situation at places near the Hati river in the district, following heavy rainfall in its catchment areas.

Two fresh deaths were reported from Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur taking the toll to 102 in the flood-affected districts. Two persons are missing while three are injured.

The number of flood-affected districts is 24. A number of people have taken shelter in relief camps.

Rivers Rapti, Ghaghara, Burhi Rapti, Rohini and Quano are in spate and have inundated vast areas in Lakhimpur Khiri, Barabanki, Faizabad and Ballia, Gorakhpur and Siddharthnagar.

Toll in Bihar reached 514 after 32 more deaths were reported today even as authorities said that the flood situation marginally improved in the state where 1.71 crore people in 19 districts are still affected.

Water receded in some places following which many people returned to their homes and the number of relief camps further dropped to 115 from 222.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar held a review meeting on flood through video conferencing with senior officials of the marooned districts and appreciated their hard work.

The flood situation in Assam continued to improve today, although 1.25 lakh people in five districts of the state are still reeling under it.

Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal took stock of the entire network of embankments and asked the water resources department to begin repairing of the breaches caused by the deluge.

According to a report by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), 1.25 lakh people were affected currently in Chirang, Morigaon, Nagaon, Karbi Anglong and Golaghat districts.

As per the ASDMA report, Morigaon was the worst hit with over 74,500 affected people, followed by Nagaon where nearly 48,000 people were hit by the deluge.

As many as 299 villages remained under water and nearly 15,500 hectares of crop area were inundated, the ASDMA said.

The authorities are running 82 relief camps and distribution centres in five districts, where 23,545 people have taken shelter.

The Dhansiri river at Numaligarh in Golaghat, the Barak at Badarpurghat in Karimganj, the Katakhal at Matizuri in Hailakandi and the Kushiyara at Karimganj town are flowing above the 'danger' mark.

The flood situation in the six districts of northwest Bengal has improved following little rainfall. Water has receded from most areas of Jalpaiguri, Coochbehar, Alipurduar, Uttar Dinajpur and Dakshin Dinajpur districts, while some areas in Malda are still inundated, he said.

The Rapti River overflowed its banks in Sauraha, 80 km (50 miles) south of the capital, Kathmandu, inundating hotels and restaurants and leaving some 600 tourists stranded.

Sauraha, on the fringe of Chitwan National Park, is home to 605 rhinoceroses and is popular with foreign tourists, including Indian and Chinese visitors, mainly for rhino watching and elephant rides.

“Some 300 guests were rescued on elephant backs and tractor trailers to (nearby) Bharatpur yesterday and the rest will be taken to safer places today,” Suman Ghimire, head of a group of Sauraha hotel owners, said by telephone on Monday.

Floods have also swept the nearby northeast Indian state of Assam state in the past two days, killing at least 15 people and displacing nearly 2.3 million, officials said on Monday.

Nearly 90 percent of Assam’s Kaziranga national park, home to the world’s largest population of the endangered one-horned rhinoceros, was under water, Forest Minister Pramilla Rani Brahma said. The animals have moved to higher ground.

In Nepal, relief workers said 26 of the country’s 75 districts were either submerged or had been hit by landslides after heavy rains lashed the Himalayan nation, home to Mount Everest and the birthplace of Lord Buddha.

The death toll was expected to rise with another 50 people reported missing, Information and Communications Minister Mohan Bahadur Basnet said.

Basnet said more than 60,000 homes were under water, mainly in the southern plains bordering India. Estimates of losses were not available, with rescuers yet to reach villages marooned by the worst floods in recent years.

“The situation is worrying as tens of thousands of people have been hit,” Basnet told Reuters.

Large swaths of farmland in the southern plains, Nepal’s breadbasket, are under water and the country could face food shortages due to crop losses, aid workers said.

“The heavy rains hit at one of the worst times, shortly after farmers planted their rice crop in the country’s most important agricultural region,” said Sumnima Shrestha, a spokeswoman for U.S.-based non-profit group Heifer International.

Monsoon rains, which start in June and continue through September, are important for farm-dependent Nepal, but they also cause heavy loss of life and property damage each year.","Sun, 13 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170814&t=2&i=1197041530&r=LYNXNPED7D126&w=800,"['nepal', 'hundreds', 'water', 'rescue', 'nepali', 'flooded', 'elephants', 'heavy', 'worst', 'help', 'rains', 'safari', 'tourists', 'toll', 'hit', 'workers', 'park']",

Geneva, August 18, 2017. As massive flood waters sweep through the countries of Nepal, India, and Bangladesh, CARE is assisting affected people in all three countries with relief supplies. CARE teams have dispatched food, water, shelter materials, hygiene kits and household supplies to areas where people sought shelter and safety. Overall, approximately 16 million people have been affected across Nepal, India and Bangladesh.

“In Bangladesh 4.8 million people in 26 districts are affected by the floods. The country’s situation is unprecedented, perhaps the worst in over 100 years. And it is likely to worsen with more places to get inundated soon”, says Zia Choudhury, Country Director for CARE Bangladesh. “People have taken refuge in government shelters with many more marooned on rooftops, highlands and any other raised structures. Food, safe drinking water and medicine have become a critical needs.” As water is moving downstream from India and Nepal, more districts are expected to be flooded in the coming days. Already, river levels in Bangladesh are higher than usual during a monsoon season and CARE teams prepare for a large scale emergency, distributing shelter materials and food to people who have lost everything.

In India, heavy rains have triggered massive floods in several states. “The situation in the villages in the state of Assam is extremely grim. Embankment of rivers in many areas have been breached forcing over 400 families to stay in extremely unhygienic conditions. Most people have lost everything including important documents. Schools are submerged under eight feet of water. Overall, the flood survivors are very worried and in dire need of support”, says Ravikant Upadhyay, Team Leader, Assam Flood Response, of CARE India. CARE India teams are supporting 3,000 people in Assam with dignity and hygiene kits. More support, especially clothes for women, sanitary items and special care for pregnant women and lactating mothers is urgently needed. As women have to venture out long distances to find dry places to defecate, they face a high risk of abuse and violence.

CARE teams in Nepal started to distribute relief supplies and will be reaching over 5,600 people with critical food, household items, shelter materials and supplies for mothers of new-born babies in the coming days. “We were neck deep in the water in our village and we have not much to eat at the moment. We can resist hunger but our children cannot”, says Binod Chaudhary, a 32 year old man from Kailali district.

Climate change is magnifying and exacerbating the current flooding in South Asia. Monsoon rains are becoming more extreme and precipitation patterns are changing, which is simultaneously increasing the prevalence of poverty. CARE will scale up its response to this devastating flooding during the weeks ahead while also continuing to work on the longer term strengthening of the communities to withstand future shocks.","Fri, 18 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/seti%202.jpg?itok=6_4gWQVX,"['teams', 'nepal', 'bangladesh', 'care', 'water', 'hunger', 'resist', 'shelter', 'south', 'supplies', 'food', 'floods', 'asia', 'children', 'women', 'india']",

This year’s deluge in two waves has killed almost 150 people and more than 330 wild animals in the Kaziranga National Park. But not included in the official list are more than 50 indigenous short-stature horses — ponies, rather — that have perished in the Jhangimukh area, about 35km east of Jorhat town.

Jorhat, often called Assam’s tea capital, is 300km east of Guwahati.

There is hardly any research on this indigenous breed of semi-wild horses that the Mishing community own. But they have been part of a 140-year-old ‘tea derby’ organised by the Jorhat Gymkhana Club, one of the oldest watering holes for tea planters in India.

“We lost at least 50 horses in fl- oods this time. There will be a sh- ortage of horses for the races fr- om next year,” Horen Tai, a jock- ey from Tinighoria village, said.

Tinighoria is one of several hamlets in the Jhangimukh area located at the confluence of the Jhangi and Brahmaputra rivers. Another river, Mori Jhangi, weaves through these hamlets before joining the Jhangi.

Used to a habitat rich in water bodies, it is unusual for these horses to drown. Besides, the Mishings let them fend for themselves on the chapories (sandbars or river islands) and bring them home a month before the races to train.

Gymkhana records show the races — at least 10 a day for 10 ponies at a time for three days — started on January 16, 1877, when CI Showers was the club’s first honorary secretary. The race month was later changed to February. It became an annual event with thoroughbreds until 1940 when the indigenous breed replaced them. The switchover was because British planters at that time began preferring mechanised transport to pedigree horses.

With the indigenous horses came the native jockeys, who introduced another tradition — bareback racing.

“The flow of the flooded rivers was stronger this time, which could be why the horses struggled to stay afloat,” Naren Tai, a village elder said.

The Brahmaputra, he added, has changed Jhangimukh’s geography over the years. The river was 10km from Tinighoria once but erosion forced the hamlet to relocate thrice.

Unlike in the past, one has to cross river Jhangi by boat to reach Tinighoria today.

“We searched the chapories after the water subsided but there are no signs of the horses. They never strayed far during floods earlier,” Horen said.

Gymkhana Club member Hardeep Singh said the villagers have informed the club about the loss of the horses. “We are organising flood relief for the villagers as well as the horses,” he said, adding the club would be providing fodder for the surviving horses since there is unlikely to be any grass left on the chapories after the flood.

There have been demands for research on the indigenous horses, whose population is yet to be estimated. The voices grew stronger after local resident Roopa Barua made an award-winning documentary titled Riders of the Mist in 2015.","Fri, 25 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2017/08/25/Pictures/_e4941bea-89bd-11e7-817c-4caf18ee223c.jpg,"['threaten', 'water', 'club', 'derby', 'perish', 'chapories', 'tinighoria', 'floods', 'assam', 'river', 'horses', 'races', 'jhangi', 'tea', 'indigenous']",

Delay in completion of projects, which are long-term solutions to flood problems of Assam, North Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh, has led to the persistence of avoidable problems. Assam has been flooded yet again this monsoon, with the disaster affecting over 165,000 and killing 76 people.

The delay in completion of multiple projects in border areas has been pointed out by a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). The report also recorded discrepancies in execution of works like granting of tenders and unjustified, higher payments that caused financial losses to the government.

Most river dams, which have the potential of flooding if they fail, were not prepared for disaster management. The CAG report reveals that only 349 dams out of 4,862 completed dams in the country have emergency disaster management plans.

Dam Safety Legislation was initiated to ensure proper inspection, maintenance and surveillance of existing dams in 2010. The policy was yet to be enacted in August 2016, the report states. Pre- and post-monsoon inspections were not carried out in most of the states and union territories. Programmes for maintenance of dams were not prepared and adequate funds were not provided to carry out structural/repair works.

Lapses in RMABA scheme

Lapse in protocol and delay in completion of projects under the River Management Activities and Works related to Border Areas (RMABA) scheme of the Ministry of Water Resources caused financial losses worth crores to the government. Rs 820 crore was approved for the scheme during the Eleventh five year plan and Rs 740 crore in the twelfth one. However, of this, only Rs 721.14 crore and Rs 339.89 crore were spent respectively (up to March 2016 in the 12th plan).

As per the CAG report, major projects in border areas such as Pancheshwar Multipurpose project (with Nepal), Kosi High Dam Multipurpose Project, Naumure Hydro-electric project and Kamla project have been delayed with their budgets revised multiple times.

For instance, funds for the Kosi High Dam Multipurpose Project (Kosi project) were first allotted in the tenth five year plan, with expenditure set at Rs 12.44 crores. After the expenditure of Rs 27.37 crore and another Rs 40.61 crore for survey and investigation activities, the project is yet to be completed. Resistance by local people has been cited as the reason for delay.

The CAG report also points out that in spite of recommendation by the Kosi High Level Committee, records for Kosi project were not maintained for the Kosi project. These history sheets were to indicate protection work undertaken and expenditure on repairs for proper assessment of their performance. Even after being reiterated by Gandak High Level Committee in 2012, records of erosion work in Bihar were not maintained.

In the report, CAG suggests time-bound execution plans for long term RMABA projects and for devising emergency action plans for dams.

Express News Service

KAZIRANGA: There is an irony to the floods in Assam. While they wreak devastation almost every year, there are a small number of people who wish for the annual deluge.

""We need floods in the Kaziranga,” says the director of the national wildlife park, Satyendra Singh. “We need them for the animals.” Floods bring three benefits to Kaziranga. Natural deaths of animals throughout the year cause large-scale decomposition. The flood waters clean up the mess. Second, the floods wash away unwanted weeds from the park. But most importantly, floods fertilise the land.

""The grasses that grow after a flood are a good diet for the animals,” says Satyendra Singh. “They improve the health of animals.” But he hastens to add, “However, we don't want a massive flood like the one we had recently.""

Last month's floods submerged 80 per cent of the UNESCO world heritage site. Altogether 105 animals, including seven rhino calves, died. It was the fourth biggest flood in the sanctuary since 1988.

Now that the waters have receded, people who fled to relief camps on high ground have returned to their villages.

The park has 111 highlands, built after the devastating flood of 1988. But many have been eroded since then. They have to be built up again. Currently, 33 highlands are being built, 14-18 feet high. A highland is usually built on an area of 800 sq m.

The government also has plans to build three flyovers on the national highway. At present the highway cuts through the park, and is punctuated by animal corridors. Animals often become road kill.

Singh says repairing damaged bridges and culverts and improving the health of animals and forests guards who work deep in the park are among the post-flood challenges for the forest department.

Last year, there were 18 incidents of rhino poaching in the Kaziranga, 14 of them taking place before and during the floods between January and August.

In sharp contrast, there have been just two such incidents so far this year. No rhino has been killed during the floods when poachers try to take advantage.

""Poaching has been curbed due to the combined efforts of the police and the forest department,"" Satyendra Singh says.

Floods in Kaziranga are caused largely by the Brahmaputra to the north and rain waters from Karbi Anglong to the south.

""If you want to solve the problem of floods in Kaziranga, you have to solve the problem across the state,"" Singh adds.

The 430 sq km Kaziranga National Park lies in Golaghat and Nagaon districts. It hosts two-thirds of world's population of great one-horned rhinos.

According to the 2015 census, the park has a rhino population of 2,401.

It is also home to the highest density of tigers among protected areas in the world and was declared a Tiger Reserve in 2006. Apart from rhinos and tigers, the park has large breeding populations of elephants, wild water buffalo and swamp deer.","Mon, 07 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2017/8/4/w600X390/Floods.jpg,"['satyendra', 'flood', 'kaziranga', 'good', 'floods', 'park', 'animals', 'singh', 'modicum', 'rhino', 'built', 'waters', 'flooding']",

With two spell of floods hitting Assam back to back, the production of rice will go down this year than the expectation. Assam agriculture minister Atul Bora said that the loss could be to the tune of 6 lakh metric tonnes.

“The target for rice production this year was 62 lakh metric tonnes, but as the floods have severely hit the Sali paddy, the state is likely to suffer a loss of around 6 lakh metric tonnes,” Bora told reporters addressing a press conference on Monday.

In 2015-16, rice production of Assam was 53 lakh metric tonnes.

More than 1.73 lakh hectares of Sali paddy have been destroyed in the flood, besides vegetables in 10,692 hectares and jute in over 7,000 hectares. A total of 3.08 lakh hectares of crop land have been affected so far in the floods and 5,055 hectres of agriculture land with paddy saplings were also damaged.

“Around 6.29 lakh farmer families in 4,717 villages have been hit in the flood this year so far. Besides, we have included 45,000 farmers under crop insurance. The department has also decided to distribute around 1 lakh shallow tube well,” added Bora.

Bora said that more than 6000 hectors agriculture lands have been affected by severe siltation in Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Jorhat, Darrang, Golaghat, Majuli and Barpeta districts.

The department will distribute the seeds among the farmers to overcome the loss in the flood. “Farmers cultivating sali paddy are unlikely to make any gains this year. So we are laying stress on the rabi crops. We are giving more thrust on crops like mustard, potato, onion and pumpkin gourd among others,” said Bora.

Bora has asked all the districts officers to compile the losses of the farmers in flood for further compensation works.

“The government will pay compensation through direct benefit transfer system to the farmers and the money will be deposited in the accounts of the farmers,” he said.","Tue, 22 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/plugins/wonderm00ns-simple-facebook-open-graph-tags/fbimg.php?is_home=0&is_front_page=0&object_type=post&post_id=7788&object_id=7788&img=https%253A%252F%252Fthenewsmill.com%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2017%252F08%252Fassam-rice-cultivation.jpg,"['sali', 'hectares', 'flood', 'wreak', 'farmers', 'havoc', 'rice', 'floods', 'assam', 'lakh', 'metric', 'loss', 'set', 'paddy', 'production']",

NEW DELHI (Taiwan News) -- The death toll in the devastating flash floods in India's north-eastern state of Assam has claimed about 120 lives. It also affected about 3,345,000 people in 29 out of the 33 districts of the state. Over 139,000 people have taken shelter in 629 relief camps across the state. According to the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), the situation may worsen further. In the last 50 years, the state has lost 7% of its land to soil erosion.

Seeing the severity of the situation, leaders of different faiths under the umbrella of Inter Faith Group jointly offered their expertise to the government in training the volunteers who are working with the flood-hit.

The team, led by Professor N Vinod Chandra Menon, founder member of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), included Father Frederick D' Souza, executive director of Caritas India, Swamini Adityananda Saraswati of Parmarth Niketan Ashram, Rishikesh, Brother Arun Kumar of Brahma Kumaris, Mount Abu, and Sibghatullah Ahmed of Islamic Relief India.

The delegation also distributed Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WaSH) kits donated by Caritas India, to 1,600 families in the worst-affected villages of Morigaon district. The kit consisted of two buckets, 2 plastic mugs, one Savlon antiseptic, five Lifebuoy bathing soaps, 4 Rani washing soaps, one soap case, five NcDCC tablet strips, 4 meter cotton coloured clothes, 2 packets of toothpastes, five toothbrushes and 1 meter cloth.

About Caritas’ involvement, D' Souza said his organization wanted to reach the unreachable without any caste or religion. Swamini said the initiative would expand the space of inter-faith. Bro Arun said as children of Brahma (God), we all have a duty to help the affected. Sibghatullah said the effort would strengthen his organization’s work in these areas.","Tue, 22 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://tnimage.s3.hicloud.net.tw/photos/shares/599bddf4daebe.jpg,"['groups', 'relief', 'victims', 'washed', 'flood', 'rescue', 'state', 'caritas', 'soaps', 'souza', 'wait', 'swamini', 'come', 'villagers', 'faith', 'whats']",

Rescue Operation Continues in Rajasthan:

In neighbouring Rajasthan, rescue operations are being carried out in flood-hit Jalore, Sirohi and Pali districts. So far, six people, including a 10-year-old child, have died, while 19 people were rescued from Jalore. Two women were swept away by flooded waters in Udaipur. Of the 19, seven had taken shelter on a tree to escape the swirling waters. Boats of NDRF are being dispatched to rescue in areas where airlifting people is not possible.

“Rescue operations resumed today in Jalore where columns of the Army and NDRF teams have been deployed. One NDRF team is in Pali and two NDRF and one SDRF team is in Sirohi.Food packets and water bottles are being dispatched for villages which are surrounded by water,” Hemant Gera, secretary-Disaster Management and Relief Department told PTI.

Situation Improves in Assam:

Situation improved in flood-hit Assam on Tuesday, however the death toll climbed to 77 after a person was reportedly washed away in Hojai. According to the report of Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), a population of 23,118 is still affected by this wave of floods in nine districts of Assam. Meanwhile, Assam government has sought an interim assistance of Rs 2,939 crore from the central government to deal with destruction caused by floods as an inter-ministerial team arrived in the state on Tuesday to assess the damage.

Odisha Braces For Floods:

In Odisha, around 40 villages in Keonjhar and Bhadrak districts remained marooned on Tuesday. Authorities in Keonjhar, Bhadrak and Jajpur districts stepped up their preparedness for rescue-and-relief operations after water level in three of the major rivers in the north crossed the danger mark. In Jajpur district, there was a flood-like situation in Jajpur, Dasarathpur and Korei blocks. Two ODRAF teams were deployed at Jajpur and Dasarathpur blocks respectively. Due to a rise in the water level of the Subarnarekha river at Rajghat, there was a flood-like situation in five gram panchayats of Baliapal block in Balasore district.

Heavy rainfall is likely to pound several parts of Odisha with a well marked low pressure persisting in the region. With heavy rains battering most parts of the state for the last couple of days, the fear of flood loomed large in north Odisha due to rise in the water level of Baitarani, Brahmani, Subarnarekha, Jalaka and Budhabalang rivers.","Wed, 26 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/c31726f31d6c000952f38bb9164f537c.jpg,"['parts', 'death', 'water', 'rs', 'flood', 'districts', 'rajasthan', 'toll', 'braces', 'state', 'havoc', 'floods', 'ndrf', 'assam', 'odisha', 'gujarat', 'north', 'rises']",

Nearly 130,000 people have been relocated to safer ground in Gujarat state after hundreds of cities and villages were devastated by weeks of torrential rain.

Helicopters and boats are combing areas including the deluged Banaskantha district where 25 bodies, including 17 members of one family, were discovered in two submerged villages last week.

On Sunday, surviving members of the family met the Gujarat chief minister, Vijay Rupani, who said the rainfall had triggered “the worst flood of the century” in parts of the state.

Nearly 700 people have died across India in recent weeks as monsoon rain has submerged roads, damaged electricity networks and triggered lethal lightning storms.

Overwhelmed authorities in Gujarat said the state’s death toll, which jumped by 90 in the past day, was likely to increase as new victims were discovered. “Only after a postmortem is conducted we can officially confirm death of a person,” an official at the Gujarat emergency control room told Agence France-Presse. “Since many bodies were found, postmortems took time, hence the sudden jump in numbers.”

The flooding has paralysed Gujarat, with flights diverted from the airport in its largest city, Ahmedabad, more than 150 factories shut down, and an estimated 50,000 cotton farms waterlogged.

More than 4,000 animals were thought to have been killed so far, local reports said.



The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, who surveyed the devastation from an aircraft last week, has already pledged at least £60m in funding for interim relief efforts. In his monthly radio address on Sunday he said “maximum possible efforts” were being made to assist residents of the state he led as chief minister for 12 years and several others affected by heavy rain in the past week.

Modi said the floods had wreaked havoc on a massive scale, adding that altered weather cycles linked to climate change were having a big negative impact. He announced 200,000 rupees’ compensation (£2,374) to the families of those killed in the deluge and 50,000 rupees to those seriously injured.

As well as Gujarat, the north-eastern states of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam have been hit by monsoon flooding, as have pockets of Odisha and Bihar in the country’s east. Lightning storms in Odisha and another state, Jharkhand, killed 21 people on Monday with more inclement weather expected throughout this week.

Most of the victims were working in fields when lightning struck them, disaster management authority officials said. Thousands of Indians are killed by lightning each year, most of them working in fields during the June to October monsoon season.

Bihar has reported nearly 140 lightning deaths since May.

Suresh Kumar, West Bengal’s top disaster management official, said 31 deaths had also been reported in a week of flooding in the state. “Heavy rains have caused massive damage in several districts,” Kumar told AFP.

In Assam at least 77 people have been killed and a state-wide emergency relief operation has been under way since April. Tens of thousands of hectares of crops have been destroyed and at least 91 animals, including seven rhinoceros, were killed in flooding at the state’s Kaziranaga national park.

The national park, which rangers said was about 90% underwater, is one of the few remaining habitats of the rare one-horned rhino. The species’ numbers – about 3,300, according to the last count four years ago – have been dented in past years by poachers and flooding in 2016 that killed more than 20, nearly half of them calves.

Meteorologists said the rainfall in Gujarat, close to the heaviest in 112 years, was the result of low-pressure systems developing simultaneously over the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian sea.



Flooding kills thousands of people each year in India, the damage exacerbated by weak enforcement of building standards, high rates of poverty and unplanned communities springing up in high-risk areas. Research in 2016 found that flooding was the most significant risk to communities and businesses in south Asia and that about 113 million people in India – nearly 10% of the population – were acutely exposed to flood hazard.","Mon, 31 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ab072940da4e77b35c8177ea31e52573041ff04/92_0_3296_1979/master/3296.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1107132c10e5545a71e76aa0e2e559b7,"['states', 'state', '213', 'killed', 'thousands', 'floods', 'monsoon', 'reveal', 'gujarat', 'waters', 'lightning', 'india', 'receding', 'victims', 'flooding']",

Extraordinary floods affect millions

India's disaster mitigation and response mechanisms have once again come into question as for weeks the floods have caused immense damages to barrages, crops and entire villages. The reality on the ground of these flood-hit regions is arguably a stark reminder of the government's failure to prepare.

""Flooding during the monsoon season normally happens from June to September, but this year's floods have been much worse,"" Hari Balaji, a consultant on disaster management, told DW.

Hussain explained that keeping children in school was crucial in sheltering them from exploitation, adding, ""We cannot go backwards.""

One way environmentalists believe this could be improved is if evacuated people had safe structures on firm ground and not in flood plains; something authorities have not been able to ensure.

""These erratic patterns are probably due to climate changes,"" K.J. Ramesh, director general of the state-run India Meteorological Department, told DW.

Officials believe flood-related destruction can only be minimized if flood forecasting and mapping is accurate. Climate change however complicates this, as places which did not previously suffer floods are now experiencing unprecedented levels of rainfall.

""Unfortunately, like flood risk mapping, India fails miserably on forecasting. We have to modernize the flood forecast network and invest in better flood forecasting policy,"" Sandeep Duggal, an expert on disaster risk reduction, told DW.

Duggal also maintained that a lack of coordination and inadequate training at the ground level remained the biggest challenges in mitigating losses.

Cities under water

Before the onset of the ongoing monsoons, Indian authorities did release guidelines spelling out how public agencies at district and local levels should act. However, despite the elaborate set of details, cities like the country's commercial hub Mumbai have fallen victim to nature's fury.

Suburban train services were crippled, airports and roads flooded and people waded through knee-deep water bringing the city to a grinding halt.

In recent decades, there has been an increasing trend of urban flood disasters in India that have swamped cities such as Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Srinagar, Chennai, Kolkata, Jamshedpur and Guwahati.

The common reasons cited are unabated construction and encroachments of sprawling slums alongside rivers and streams, and the shoddy management of storm water drains carried out by civic contractors.

According to IndiaSpend, a public interest journalism website, disaster management is yet to be seen as an essential part of good governance and integral to development planning in India.

""Cities grow without adequate infrastructure, and whatever exists is inadequate for extreme rainfall,"" it said in a statement.

For yet another day, heavy rain continued to lash the Madhya Maharashtra, Vidarbha and Konkan regions of the state. Over places in Vidarbha and Konkan, very heavy rainfall up to 200 mm was reported between 8:30 am Tuesday and 8:30 am Wednesday. The incessant rain created a flood-like situation in some villages in Vidarbha, while places such as Bramhapuri (208 mm) and Chandrapur (96 mm) were reported among the wettest in the country.

Harnai (200 mm) and Mahabaleshwar (182 mm) also recorded heavy rain since Tuesday night. Cloudy conditions prevailed over Pune city and adjoining areas, with light showers reported from some parts. The city received 2 mm of rain between 8.30am and 5.30pm on Wednesday. Officials at India Meteorology Department (IMD), Pune, have attributed the enhanced rainfall over the state — particularly since early this week — to a low pressure system formed over the Bay of Bengal.

“This system, which had intensified into a depression, caused heavy spells of rain over Vidarbha and neighbouring areas. As the system has now progressed and lies over Odhisha, similar intensity of rainfall is likely to continue until July 22,” said a senior IMD official. “We are expecting heavy rain to prevail over Konkan and Mahdya Maharashtra, but the situation shall improve over Vidarbha during the next 48 hours,” he added.","Thu, 20 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/07/as-7595.jpg,"['rainfall', 'vidarbha', 'imd', 'pune', 'rain', 'state', 'region', 'heavy', 'week', 'mm', 'situation', 'incessant', 'floodlike', 'system']",

Cargo vessels are rarely seen and passengers are transported in rickety wooden boats. But developing the Brahmaputra into an international waterway, as envisaged in the National Waterways Act, could give the state of Assam and the rest of India’s northeast an edge. This would make it India’s link to ASEAN nations as the government’s Act East policy comes to the fore.

The Brahmaputra National Waterway 2 – an 890 kilometre-long reach of the river from Sadiya in Assam to the Bangladesh border – could act as the economic corridor to international ports such as Chittagong in Bangladesh and Haldia Port in West Bengal, boosting trade with southeast Asian countries.

To realise such a future, a tripartite agreement for dredging the Brahmaputra was signed between the Assam government on one hand and the Indian inland waterways and national highways authorities on the other at the closing ceremony of the Namami Brahmaputra Festival in Guwahati in April. Nitin Gadkari, India’s union minister of road transport, highways and shipping, hoped that the project would change the economic livelihoods for people in Assam, He announced that the national government would provide 400 billion rupees (USD 6.2 billion) for the construction of the ambitious Brahmaputra Express Highways on both banks of the river.

Deemed one of the largest infrastructure projects in the northeast, the 6.4 billion rupee (USD 998 million) highway will stretch 840 kilometres along both banks of the Brahmaputra between Sadiya and Dhubri. The project was found to be technically feasible by the water resource ministry which, after a preliminary survey, offered to help in the work to stabilise both banks, find sustainable solutions to flooding and erosion, and develop the waterways for navigation. Meanwhile, the World Bank has given 98 million rupees (1.5 million) to the Inland Water Transport infrastructure development project to support its work in dredging the river to maximise its navigational potential and introducing safe, modern and economical passenger vessels and river cruisers for tourists.

The IWT operates 100 ferry services on the Brahmaputra and Barak rivers and their tributaries, used by around 6.9 million people annually. The project of the IWT Directorate for the Brahmaputra — a long term strategic plan, capacity development and improving passenger ferry services — has already started said M Rahman, joint director of the IWT, adding that it would also study the natural flow of the river and the impact of the project on aquatic biodiversity and riparians.

Dredging to control floods?

“Dredging of the Brahmaputra and Barak rivers will not only help to deal with the problem of floods, which affects Assam and Bangladesh, but also improve the navigation facilities in the rivers, which can strengthen trade and commerce between India and its neighbour through riverine routes,” said Sarbananda Sonowal, chief minister of Assam, at the inaugural session of the 8th India-Bangladesh Friendship Dialogue on July 2. According to the chief minister, dredging 1,300 kilometres of the Brahmaputra would also provide material needed to build the highway along its banks, a task for which state government would seek the support and cooperation of Bangladesh.

Dredging the Brahmaputra and its tributaries is not a new idea. “During British rule, dredging was done as a protective measure from floods,” says PK Dutta, an engineer who submitted the dredging plans to Prime Minister Modi. A more recent attempt to dredge the Assam-stretch of the Brahmaputra in 1974 was largely unsuccessful. Dutta’s plan envisages restricting the Brahmaputra within a-two kilometre wide course and using the dredged silt to reclaim the land lost to erosion to build the highways. The current plan remains the same but with one change that the channel to be dredged has been limited to 45 metres. However, no Detailed Project Report (DPR) is available for this project.

Economically not viable

But the project, set to start in September, has been mired in controversy with experts suspecting the dredging is easier said than done. An expert team from the Dredging Corporation of India (DCI) visited Assam in September 2016 and reported that a detailed morphological and hydrological study of the river was needed to explore the possibilities for dredging its huge sediment deposits.

With an annual discharge rate of around 20,000 cubic metres per second at its mouth, the river is the fourth biggest in terms of discharge. Having such a large drainage area, the Brahmaputra is heavily charged with sediment and as a result of siltation has been steadily expanding — from two kilometres near Guwahati to 14 kilometres at places such as Sadiya and Dibrugarh. This is considered to be a major hurdle to dredging.The Brahmaputra is also a heavily braided river — another impediment to the plan.

“The mighty Brahmaputra and its tributaries carry huge amounts of silt with its flow, around 1.8 billion tonnes per year. Carrying silt from the upper catchment of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries and depositing it in the main stream is a continuous process, mostly due to the vast deforestation and infrastructure development activities in the upper hilly catchment of the rivers,” says Pradip Puzari, a project manager at M/S Patel Engineering Ltd. “It is impossible to make the river bed free from silt deposition by dredging, unless a suitable mechanism is applied to capture and dispose of the silt load flowing into the main stream from its tributaries. Otherwise, the dredged portion of the river bed will be filled up with fresh silt immediately. Dredging along a particular width of a channel along the Brahmaputra for navigational purposes will not support a permanent solution to the recurring floods and erosion of the Brahmaputra basin.”

So where is the need for such an economically-unviable project? Puzari maintains that the state government should come up with a transparent detailed project report (DPR) taking into consideration the riparians and riverine biodiversity.

No environment impact assessment

A highly-active river in an area known for its biological and cultural diversity, the Brahmaputra is the lifeline for communities living along its banks and the fragile ecology of the eastern Himalayan region. The Brahmaputra Valley has been densely populated for centuries and most is still used for agriculture. Some blocks of natural habitat do remain, mainly as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, including 12 identified as protected areas by the World Wildlife Fund.

“The Brahmaputra and its adjoining floodplain lakes hold hundreds of species of macroinvertebrate and avian fauna, the most fascinating of which is the endangered Ganges dolphin,” says Prof S P Biswas, head of the life sciences department at Dibrugarh University. “Siltation of the river bed and the widening of the river is a common scenario along stretches of the Brahmaputra.The erratic nature of water discharge, high rates of erosion and siltation and habitat destruction have negative impacts on commercial fisheries and native species such as giant catfish, mahseer and turtles. Their numbers are dwindling sharply in the upper stretches, with the Ganges dolphin being the hardest hit.”

Numerous environmental concerns associated with dredging the Brahmaputra need to addressed, but the government seems to ignore those most critical. There are questions over how the construction of the expressways on both banks of the river is possible without disturbing the the river connections with other channels and water bodies. But one key question remains: how can the Assam government continue with such a massive project, without conducting the necessary environment impact assessment?","Tue, 29 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thethirdpole.net/content/uploads/2017/08/Brahmaputra-dredging1.jpg,"['water', 'dredging', 'brahmaputra', 'silt', 'assam', 'national', 'project', 'banks', 'tributaries', 'river']",

Earlier this month, a freak conjunction of four atmospheric systems dumped an unusual amount of rain within the span of 24 hours on Bengaluru — and because stormwater drains could not cope with the downpour that broke the daily record for August for more than 120 years, the city’s low-lying areas were inundated, water entered homes in many neighbourhoods, and the authorities had to use boats to ferry stranded people.

A little more than a year ago, another downpour over a few hours, too, had paralysed life in India’s IT hub. In their report, ‘Urban Floods, A Case Study of Bangalore’ (Journal of the National Institute of Disaster Management, April 2009), T V Ramachandra and Pradeep P Mujumdar, hydrologists at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, blamed floods in the city on the “lack of drainage upgrade works, the encroachment and filling in the floodplain on the waterways, obstruction by the sewer pipes and manholes and relevant structures, deposits of building materials and solid wastes with subsequent blockage of the system, and also flow restrictions from under-capacity road crossings (bridge and culverts)”.

They wrote that “the lack of planning and enforcement has resulted in significant narrowing of the waterways and filling in of the floodplain by illegal developments”, which has “subsequently caused flooding to other properties that have not previously been flooded”.

The repeated flooding in Bengaluru is similar to deluges that drowned Chennai in November 2015 and Srinagar in 2014 — even though those floods caused far greater havoc and tragedy. All are the result of urban planners giving the short shrift to a fundamental principle of hydrology: natural water bodies soak up excess rainfall and use it to replenish groundwater; inter-related drainage systems created by these ponds, streams, lakes and channels then release the excess water into larger water bodies — oceans and big rivers. Our cities are increasingly getting shorn of such ‘sponges’.

Bengaluru, Ramachandra and Mujumdar wrote, “is just one example of bad water management practices. Years of siltation of tanks have reduced their water storage capacity. Encroachments of nalas, lakes and other water bodies, choking of streams and stormwater drains, have taken their toll”. In a separate report, ‘Wetlands, Treasure of Bangalore: Abused, Polluted, Encroached and Vanishing’ (December 2015), co-authored with Sudarshan P Bhat, Asulabha K S, Sincy V, and Bharath H Aithal, Ramachandra wrote that 98% of the famous lakes of Bengaluru were encroached, rendering the city vulnerable to flooding even after normal rain. Bengaluru had more than 250 lakes about 50 years ago. Today, fewer than 10 remain in a healthy state.

The pattern is similar elsewhere. After the Srinagar floods of 2014, a report by the New Delhi-based nonprofit sustainable development advocacy group Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) noted that in the past 100 years, more than 50% of Srinagar’s lakes, ponds and wetlands have been encroached upon to construct buildings and roads.

The demands of urban development very often turn a city into a flatland that militates against its natural topographical and hydrological features. But when there is excess rainfall, the water follows the city’s natural incline. Forgotten river channels sometimes spring back to life, but with disastrous consequences. Mumbai authorities had virtually forgotten the city’s Mithi river until the catastrophic flooding of July 26, 2005. What was once a flowing river had been blocked at every corner; there were encroachments and constructions on the riverbed and at the point where the river would discharge into the sea. In Delhi, a stream used to feed the Yamuna at about the same place where the busy ITO area is today. It is not without reason that the area is one of the worst waterlogged when it rains heavily.

Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai, Srinagar, Delhi, Gurgaon, etc. are all examples of human intervention that have rendered a city unfit to deal with a deluge. But floods are also a natural occurrence. In Assam and north Bihar, for example, they happen almost every year. In his paper, ‘Hydrology of Floods in South Asia’ (November 2002), Shafiqul Islam of the University of Cincinnati showed how a combination of weather patterns and topography leads to regular flooding of the Brahmaputra. As the ice melts in the Himalayas, the water channels downstream swell. When the river enters Assam from Arunachal Pradesh, it experiences a steep fall in gradient, causing the water to hurtle down at a furious pace. During the monsoon, when the river is swollen with the precipitation from the Eastern Himalayas, its channels can’t take the huge volumes gushing down at high speed. Siltation and sedimentation in the channels compound the situation.

There is, however, a human hand in such floods as well. With increasing deforestation in the Eastern Himalayas, the run-off has increased, which means as the water rushes towards the plains, it carries along more sediment. The riverbed in the plains is full of sediment, impairing the Brahmaputra’s carrying capacity. Earlier, the forests would soak up a lot of the run-off — somewhat like the wetlands.

In Guwahati, the human culpability for the floods increases. The deluge here seems similar to the ones in Bengaluru, or other Indian cities. Guwahati’s bowl shape anyway makes it prone to waterlogging; poor urban planning has increased its vulnerability. Wetlands that could have soaked up the rainwater or channelled them to the Brahmaputra are choked with garbage; they get clogged during heavy rain and the water spills on to the roads. A 2014 report of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority said: “The city does not have a planned drainage system to take care of sewage, so the natural channels become all the more important. The condition of these channels are not very convincing as they are constantly covered with garbage.”

Most wetlands in Guwahati are on the verge of extinction today. Unless natural sponges are revived and restored, India’s cities will remain vulnerable to manmade flooding, especially as climate change makes rainfall patterns increasingly more erratic.","Tue, 29 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/floods1.jpg,"['srinagar', 'water', 'city', 'flooding', 'channels', 'fact', 'floods', 'lakes', 'bengaluru', 'natural', 'similar', 'different', 'river']",

HOJAI: Emperor Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Sikh kingdom might have never imagined that descendants of 500 Sikh soldiers whom he had sent to Assam to fight Burmese invaders in 1822 would mitigate recurring annual floods 195 years later with Sikhism’s essential free kitchen or ‘langar’ at Barkola village in central Assam’s Nagaon district.

“Barkola village is situated a bit upland because of which it becomes an island every year during floods. When neighbouring villages get inundated, residents come in boats to seek shelter in the four gurdwaras and schools of Barkola. We provide free food to the victims in the langars of the four gurdwaras of the village. As government relief comes late and in scant amount, we villagers ourselves share whatever food we have. We survive because of this cooperation,” said Kartara Singh, president of Nanak Sahi gurdwara in the village.

Located some 15 km south of Nagaon town, Barkola boats 10,000 residents out of which 2,000 are Sikhs, mostly Dalit Mazhabis. Tiwa and Koch tribals, Assamese Dalit communities such as Hiras and Kaibartyas and OBC Nath Jugis make up rest of the population.

Prolonged isolation from Punjab has made the Sikhs closer to Assamese communities that with other Sikhs.

“We speak Assamese, call ourselves Assamese Sikhs and intermarry with Assamese Hindus. The then Punjab chief minister Giani Jail Singh along with Surjit Singh Barnala had visited Assam in 1975 to meet us. Learning that we can’t speak Punjabi, he had requisitioned Siromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) of Amritsar and sent one Giani Bhajan Singh of Anandpur Sahib to teach us Gurumukhi script in 1979. He married a local Assamese Sikh woman, lived with us for 30 years and died recently after retirement,” Kartara Singh added. However, since then the SGPC has not assisted the Assamese Sikhs in the maintenance of gurdwaras or development of the community kitchens.

Narrating the history of the Assamese Sikhs, Assamese Sikh Association general secretary and principal of the lone higher secondary school in Barkola, Pratap Singh said: “Ahom king Swargadeo Chandrakanta Singha requested help from Maharaja Ranjit Singh to fight Burmese invaders in Assam. Some 500 Sikh soldiers fought the Burmese in Hadirasokhi in Goalpara out of which only a dozen survived. They sailed across Brahmaputra in a boat through its tributary Kopili to Chaparmukh in Nagaon district. Of the survivors, one Subedar Ram Singh left Chaparmukh for Barkola, married a local Assamese woman and established our roots. From Barkola, few families established communities in Helem in Sonitpur district, Hathipara in Nagaon district and Lanka in Hojai district.”

Over the years, the Assamese Sikhs have assimilated into the Assamese identity so much so that till 1980s, they used to call the gurdwaras as ‘naamghar’ or traditional Assamese temple. The village also has its share into Assamese nationalism.

“Three sons of Barkola, Chandan Singh, Karam Singh and Banindra Mazumdar laid down their lives during 1983 Assam agitation. All of us took out silent marches during that period. The men were all geared up to fight against illegal immigration of Bangladeshis. They were all agitated. We spent sleepless nights,” Harbansh Kaur added.

However, the village still feels neglected despite contributing top police officials, army officers and Assamese language literatures.

“We have been demanding construction of embankment along the Kopili river as permanent solution to provide relief to us from recurring floods. Work began but has remained incomplete for the past 30 years,” Pratap Singh added.

Facing inundation of agricultural fields every year, the village has lost its expertise in making the famous ‘Barkola jaggery’.

“Sugarcane cultivation has massively reduced due to recurring floods. Our jaggery was famous throughout Northeast. Now, most people are indulged only in rice and vegetable cultivation. Some 80% of Barkola residents are cultivators and the remaining 20% have government jobs,” said Dakhinpat Gaon panchayat president Tutumoni Saikia Laskar.

Though the Assamese Sikhs have been included in the minority board and get some benefit of government schemes, their demand for Assamese Sikh Development Council for the past 20 years has been ignored.

“We are too scattered and too divided politically to matter as an electorate,” Pratap Singh added.","Thu, 10 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2017/8/10/w600X390/years12.jpg,"['barkola', 'flood', 'nagaon', 'continue', 'sikh', 'assamese', 'langars', 'gurdwaras', '195', 'help', 'floods', 'singh', 'assam', 'sikhs', 'village', 'displaced']",

The sprawling Tibetan plateau also arms Beijing with water leverage over downstream countries because it is the starting point for most of Asia’s great rivers, many of which are being heavily dammed just before they cross into neighbouring nations.

China is sharpening its leverage with co-riparian India. Water indeed has emerged as a new divide in Sino-Indian relations, as Beijing quietly and opaquely builds dams, barrages and other structures on rivers flowing to India. It spurned then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s 2013 proposal that the two countries enter into a water treaty or establish an intergovernmental institution to define mutual rights and responsibilities on shared rivers. The flash floods that ravaged Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh between 2000 and 2005 were linked to the unannounced releases from rain-swollen Chinese dams and barrages.

At a time when the Doklam face-off has entered its third month and the risk of a Chinese military attack on India is growing, there is more troubling news: Beijing is fashioning water into a political weapon by denying India flood-related hydrological data since May, even as major flooding has hit the region from Assam to Uttar Pradesh. Data on upstream river flows is essential for flood forecasting and warning in order to save lives and reduce material losses. China’s data denial crimps flash flood modelling in India.

By embarking on a dangerous game of water poker, Beijing has demonstrated how the denial of hydrological data in the critically important monsoon season amounts to the use of water as a political tool against a downstream country. Indeed, even while supplying data in past years, China’s lack of transparency raised questions. After all, like rice traded on the world market, hydrological data comes in different grades and qualities — from good, reliable data to inferior data and broken data.

China’s latest action actually violates two bilateral MOUs of 2013 and a 2014 accord, which obligate it to transfer hydrological data to India from three upstream monitoring stations in Tibet every year from May 15 to October 15. No data has been transferred thus far this year, although India, in keeping with the MOUs, paid for the data in advance. While China sells hydrological data to downriver countries, India provides such data free to both its downstream neighbours — Pakistan and Bangladesh.

China has long displayed contempt for international law. No bilateral accord seems to have binding force for it once its immediate purpose has passed, as Beijing recently highlighted by trashing the 1984 Sino-British treaty that paved the way for Hong Kong’s handover in 1997. China said that pact had lost “practical meaning” because 20 years had passed since Hong Kong’s return. Yet it selectively invokes a 19th-century, colonial-era accord to justify its Doklam intrusion, while ignoring its own violations — cited by Bhutan and India — of more recent bilateral agreements not to disturb the territorial status quo.

India should not be downplaying China’s breach of commitment to supply hydrological data from May 15. Yet, for two months, the ministry of external affairs hid China’s contravention, which began much before the Doklam standoff. When the ministry of external affairs (MEA) finally admitted China’s breach of obligation, it simultaneously sought to shield Beijing by saying there could be a “technical reason” for non-transfer of data (just as MEA sought to obscure China’s August 15 twin raids in the Pangong Lake area by gratuitously telling the Financial Times that “no commonly delineated boundary” exists there). How can a technical hitch explain data withholding from three separate stations for over two months? Had China been in India’s place, it would have promptly raised a hue and cry about the commitment violation and linked it to the downstream floods and deaths.

More fundamentally, the Doklam standoff, the Chinese hydro-engineering projects to re-engineer cross-border river flows, the denial of hydrological data, and China’s claims to vast tracts of Indian land are all a reminder that Tibet is at the heart of the India-China divide. The 1951 fall of Tibet represented the most far-reaching geopolitical development in modern India’s history, with the impact exacerbated by subsequent Indian blunders. India must subtly reopen Tibet as an outstanding issue, including by using historically more accurate expressions like “Indo-Tibetan border” (not “India-China border”) and emphasising that its previously stated positions were linked to Tibet securing real autonomy.

The irony for India is inescapable as vast swathes of its lands in the west, north, northeast and east are under water even as the south is eternally looking up at the sky hoping for a revival of the monsoon. Such fury of extreme rainfall concentrated in particular places is being felt in many parts of the world, but in the more advanced countries the loss of life is minimal. It’s in India that we lose hundreds of our fellow citizens in disasters as flash floods ruin urban and semi urban areas. The extent to which people living in parts of Assam, Bengal and Bihar have been devastated is once again representative of what little we can do against this phenomenon.

The depredation of urban and semi-urban colonies by the environment is, however, less than the damage that is being caused to the ecologically sensitive mountains causing untold damage. The water gushing down from Nepal is flooding rivers flowing west into India and the country is blaming road building in India for the woes.

GUWAHATI: His critics may call him “quirky” but Rupjyoti Kurmi will always be there

among people when they are suffering.

Photos of the Assam Congress MLA, carrying sacks of flood relief on his back for distribution to the marooned, have gone viral on social media. He represents Mariani constituency in the assembly. His mother, late Rupam Kurmi, too had represented the seat and was a cabinet minister.

On Wednesday, the Rupjyoti Kurmi Fans’ Club and the Mariani-based Hengul Theatre distributed relief materials to the flood victims in Kaziranga.

“The flood this year in Assam has been devastating. With the rains gone, the water has started receding but the victims haven’t been able to go to their villages and are suffering. So, we thought we could do something for them. Later, relief materials were collected from traders, besides friends and well-wishers, and subsequently distributed,” Kurmi told the New Indian Express.

Asked why he had to carry sacks of flood relief on his back, he said, “I am no different from others. I may be an MLA but I am also a human being. I enjoy being among people and working for them”.

The MLA was critical of the Central government for all its “tall talks” and not doing anything to mitigate the sufferings of flood victims.

“Scores of lives have been lost and lakhs of people affected. But so far, there hasn’t been any assistance from the Narendra Modi government. Recently, Union minister of state for home, Kiren Rijiju, visited the state to take stock of the situation and promised assistance. Last year too, home minister Rajnath Singh

had come and promised help but eventually, Assam got nothing,” Kurmi lamented.

He added that had there been such a flood in Bihar or Uttar Pradesh, the Centre would have come up with a huge relief package and rushed ministers there.

If Kurmi has many fans and well-wishers, he has his critics as well. They contend that he unnecessarily pokes his nose in issues which are in the domain of the police and the mandarins. But then politicians always do so.","Sat, 22 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2017/7/22/w600X390/DFHktaIWsAAwzwI.jpg,"['relief', 'victims', 'powers', 'wellwishers', 'flood', 'state', 'mla', 'assam', 'rupjyoti', 'sacks', 'kurmi', 'quirky']",

Similarly, in the western region, farmers could go for mustard and chana crop due to good moisture available in the soil.In Assam and eastern Uttar Pradesh region the severity of crop loss was less compared to Bihar where fields were inundated with water. “In 10-12 districts in Bihar, paddy has been hit. In Gujarat, West Bengal and Rajasthan flooded fields are concentrated in one or two districts with water receding, so no major impact on crop production,” said Singh.Considering that till last Friday, total planting had covered 976.3 lakh hectares, as per the agriculture ministry data, the impact would not be huge, ministry officials said. The government has set a target of planting crop on 1058.6 lakh hectare this kharif season.Floods have wreaked havoc in northern parts of Bihar causing damage to paddy and maize crops. Sixteen districts of the state namely, Sitamarhi, West Champaran, Katihar, Madhubani, East Champaran, Darbhanga, Madhepura, Supual, Kisanganj, Gopalganj, Purnea, Muzaffarpur, Khagaria, Saran, Saharsa and Sheohar are under flood water.""Eighty-seven blocks in these 16 districts are under water affecting 49.6% of the crops growing in the region. According to an initial estimate, 6.32 lakh hectares are under water. However, we are yet to gauge the value of crop loss. It will take another week to evaluate the crop loss. Paddy and maize are the major crops grown in these districts,"" said Himanshu Kumar Rai, agriculture director of Bihar.Rai added that the state government has come up with Akashmik Fasal Yojana to tackle this sudden disaster that has happened due to incessant rains in northern Bihar. ""The state government has made an allocation of Rs 24.28 crore for buying seeds and distribute to farmers so they can undertake replantation. Once the water recedes we will distribute short duration paddy seeds as well as vegetable seeds to the affected farmers,"" he said.Speaking to ET, Gujarat's agriculture minister Chiman Sapariya said that floods had affected 8 lakh hectares land in the state largely in Banaskantha and Patan with cotton , groundnut and pulses.“Survey is going on and will be completed in next two days. Approximately, out of the 8 lakh hectares, I think 2.5 lakh hectares under various crops have been hit. The state government will ensure financial aid to farmers at the earliest. It is the right time to plant castor and moong,” said Sapariya.Gujarat government officials said more than 6.5 lakh hectares submerged under water accounted for more than 33% damage. Total planting in the state till last week was 80 lakh hectare said officials. Gujarat would be giving Rs 1500 crore relief package for farmers while the centre has announced another Rs 500 crore.Similarly, in Assam floods covered 60% of the 3.08 lakh hectares have damaged crops, said Assam agriculture commissioner Amlan Baruah. “Consecutive floods for three years this kharif season in the state have hit paddy, vegetable and jute planting. Rice nurseries and fields are inundated and we have to see how much we can retrieve, once the water recedes,” he said adding that total planting this season has been 14.6 lakh hectares.West Bengal, Bihar's neighbouring state, is also facing the wrath of floods. In north Bengal, 5 lakh hectares of crop area is under water. Pradip Mazumdar, agriculture advisor to chief minister Mamata Banerjee, said ""The total estimated crop loss is to the tune of Rs 2,500 crore. Paddy has been damaged. Paddy saplings are still under water. At this point, we are not sure whether the entire damaged crop will be recovered. However, at the state government level, we are ready with short duration paddy seeds. Once water recedes, we will distribute the seeds among farmers."" The state produced 16.2 million of rice in kharif 2016.In Rajasthan, where 4.5 lakh hectares land largely under bajra, moong and moth, planting has been affected according to Vikas Kumar Bhale commissioner agriculture, Rajasthan.‘We will soon be claiming 25% of the sum assured under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana to be disbursed at the earliest to farmers. Most of the fields flooded in the last week of July are still under water. We expect farmers to take advantage of it in planting mustard and chana this winter,” Bhale said.Premchand Meena, agricultural production commissioner of Madhya Pradesh said that there have been floods in southern parts of the state which affected 5% of the kharif crops that include groundnut, soybean, paddy and urad. “However, the northern part of the state is deficient in rain, which is a matter of concern to us,” said Meena.The Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA) in its latest report said this year monsoon arrived on time and the sowing of soybean was done during 10th June to 20th July, 2017.“In some areas, re-sowing had to be done because an extended dry spell. It is estimated that area under soybean may decrease by about 6.4% over last year’s area estimate of SOPA,” the report adds.Over all condition of the soybean crop in most areas is normal. In some parts of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, where light soil exists, soybean crop has already been damaged due to moisture stress, which may affect the overall productivity adversely in these areas, SOPA said.Back in Bengal, rice producers and millers do not see a pressure on rice availability due to wide spread floods in north Bengal that has affected the paddy crop.“There will be no major impact as the damage is not devastating. Moreover, we have surplus paddy and there is enough stock in the state,” said Manoj Kumar Modi, owner of Swastika Rice Mill that markets rice under Lion brand name.His views were also echoed by Anghsu Mallick, chief operating officer, Adani Wilmar. “There is enough foodgrains in the country and therefore, any crop loss will not affect the supply side and jack up prices.”","Wed, 30 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-60292531,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-55407,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg","['water', 'crop', 'hectares', 'paddy', 'impact', 'planting', 'state', 'farmers', 'floods', 'rice', 'output', 'crops', 'lakh', 'farm', 'wont']",

Heavy and incessant rains have led to severe flooding especially in Himalayan region, towards the north-eastern part of country. Bihar, West Bengal, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh are reeling under the first spell of severe flooding. Assam is suffering the third deadly spell since July this year. Over 1 crore people have been displaced across these five states alone, with 99 districts hit by floods.

Over 1,221 relief camps/distribution centers are currently operational across these states. In Assam alone, 4.43 lakh are taking refuge across 935 camps set up in the state. In Bihar, approximately 7,310 villages have been hit, and over 422,106 people staying in 1,358 relief camps currently operating in the state. Uttar Pradesh is reeling under the aftermath with over 2.4 million people affected. The families residing in flooded areas of Uttar Pradesh are seen evacuating to higher regions, nearer to national highways, and staying in makeshift arrangements.

The situation in each of these states remains precarious for most families, making them extremely vulnerable. Currently, the rescue missions are underway, but as the water receded the damages are expected to be very high. Especially in case of houses, inundation is expected to cause severe damage to houses.

Continuation of education for many children stands threatened.

On 29 August, the city was battered by a monsoon storm which left homes, highways and hospital floors submerged, and shut down the commuter railway which has to carry more people every day than live in Denmark. More than 20 people are dead: swept away or crushed as multi-storey buildings collapsed. Bodies are still washing ashore.

Instead of feeling surprise, though, Mumbai treated the deluge like an unwelcome guest who keeps coming by and trashing the place. The most unnerving collective flashback was to 26 July 2005. Ferocious rainfall that day turned the city into a lethal aquatic obstacle course, which 700 people did not survive. That year’s flood, like this one, was followed by a flood of assurances from elected leaders, and civic pledges to protect waterways and mangroves, and renewed attention to how a metropolis built largely on tidal estuary and marine “reclamations” could so easily return to the water.

The storm in Mumbai deposited 15% of the city’s annual rainfall in a single day

As Mumbai wades through deja vu, provinces further east are struggling to keep their heads above water, as they have been for weeks. Hundreds of villages have been abandoned in Bihar, West Bengal and Assam. The direct death toll may exceed 800 (no one is likely to count the lives lost or stunted in the longer term – the result of crops, homes and public works swept away in some of India’s poorest states).

Like Mumbai, though, these are places accustomed to flooding. Some of the world’s largest rivers flow through them, and spill their banks each monsoon. The mutability of land and water is an essential trait of parts of Bengal and Assam, and a theme in their literature. Amitav Ghosh, the bard of this theme in the English language, wrote of Bengal’s mangrove forests: “Here, in the tide country, transformation is the rule of life: rivers stray from week to week, and islands are made and unmade in days.” So are the plains, on occasion.

Floods in eastern India are often woven into tradition, as part of the cycle that rejuvenates fields, fish stocks and wetland forest. This inclines Indians to acceptance. “Don’t try to fight nature,” the actor Amitabh Bachchan tweeted on the night of 29 August, as the storm abated in Mumbai. “Don’t put blame.” Well, we do put blame, and object to state incompetence, reckless urbanisation and failures of disaster response. Afterwards, though, especially when watching from indoors, we cherish the monsoon’s show of strength and surplus, and feel the familiarity of the flood. This is a deadly mistake.

In Mumbai and Assam, recent floods have occurred where flooding is traditional, but no longer for traditional reasons. The storm in Mumbai deposited 15% of the city’s annual rainfall in a single day. The same occurred on 21 August in Chandigarh, northern India. Bengaluru, in the south, received 30% of its annual average on 15 August – the heaviest rainfall recorded in the past century.

Mumbai’s storm is classed as an “extreme rain event”. Climate change models predict that they will become more frequent and proliferate into parts of India never thought of as monsoon hotspots, where the pumps are even less likely to be primed. This is the new, turbulent nature of our monsoon: that we are receiving more and more of our rainfall in extreme doses (which causes floods), and less in between the major deluges, which is when fields are fed and water tables recharged. For India, more flooding and more drought are not two possible futures. Both are here together, already.

The submergence of so much of India by this monsoon is not an expression of timeless natural rhythms or even classic state failures. Extreme rain events mean that, as environmental scientist Sunita Narain put it, “floods in the time of drought are India’s new normal”. Recognising this is integral to creating homes, farms and infrastructure which can survive the changing monsoon.

The government of Narendra Modi was elected, in part, on a promise of economic development, which it has struggled to deliver. One way to defend our gains, in real terms, is by moving fast to help cities and districts adapt: both to control flooding and save lives, and to harvest heavy rainfall and save water.","Mon, 04 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd1f2ae8f9c8f6486531dc2cc7387fbccbf428ee/31_90_2528_1517/master/2528.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMtYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=17403dd61626c68fdf6135312b07c430,"['storm', 'water', 'season', 'flooding', 'raghu', 'mumbai', 'karnad', 'floods', 'assam', 'drought', 'monsoon', 'homes', 'india', 'rainfall', 'future', 'parts']",
