0,0,FL-2019-000011-IDN,Indonesia: Flash Floods and Landslides in South Sulawesi Province Information bulletin - Indonesia - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/indonesia/indonesia-flash-floods-and-landslides-south-sulawesi-province-information-bulletin,"The situation

Due to heavy and non-stop rainfall in South Sulawesi area from Monday, 21 January 2019, the water volume in Bili-Bili water reservoir increased up to 101.9 metres from normal level. According to South Sulawesi province government head of public relations, this water level escalation is indicated as alert-status. Therefore, on the next day (Tuesday, 22 January) the government decided to open the Bili-bili reservoir spillway to normalize the water volume in the reservoir.

However, the decision caused Jeneberang river to become overflowed and flooded the area of Gowa District. Furthermore, the overflowed Jeneberang river caused Manuju bridge to collapse. The bridge used to connect Gowa district and Moncongloe village.

According to the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB) official report on 25 January, the flood has affected 106 villages within 13 districts (Jenepoto, Maros, Gowa, Makassar-city, Soppeng, Wajo, Barru,

Pangkep, Sidra, Bantaeng, Takalar, Selayar and Sinjai district). Furthermore, according to the report:

59 people reported dead, 25 people are missing, 47 people injured, 3,481 people evacuated and a total of 6,596 people affected by the flood;

79 unit of houses are damaged (32 unit washed away by the flood, 26 heavily-damaged, 2 mediumdamaged, 14 lightly-damaged and 5 buried by landslides);

4,857 houses covered by flood water;

11,876 hectare of farm field covered by flood water;

10 bridges damaged; the floods covered 16.2 km of road in the area, 2 markets, 12 praying houses, 6 government facilities and 22 schools.

Response by the provincial disaster management agency (BPBD)

BPBD together with the military, police, the National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas), local government office, Ministry of Social Welfare Volunteers (Tagana), Indonesian Red Cross (PMI), volunteers and the community are providing emergency response support to the affected people. Relief aids are being delivered to the areas from various governmental organization and ministries or agencies such as BNPB with BPBD, Indonesian Military and Police unit, Basarnas, Social Ministry, Health Ministry, Ministry of Public Work and Housing. Furthermore, Head of BNPB has released in total of IDR 1.15 billion (on-call) Emergency Funds and in total of IDR 828.9 million worth of logistics to the Governor of South Sulawesi (24 January 2019). Relief items such as 250 tents, 425 clothes, 560 blankets, 100 family kits, 202 baby kits, 240 sleeping mats, 30 body bags, 300 sand bags, 540 packs of instant food, 714 packs of ready food and 690 packs of vitamins and nutritious food have been dispatched.

As of date, the situation keeps on improving. The water level (flood level) keeps on decreasing as well as the rainfall has stopped. Main activities in the affected areas are evacuation; search and rescue for the landslide affected area.

The Government has declared emergency status for South Sulawesi province. The emergency status started from 22 January 2019 and will last for 7 days or until 29 January 2019. The emergency response for Gowa,

Jenepoto, Maros and Makassar-city districts carried out and coordinated locally through BPBD along with the establishment of command post, field kitchen and displacement site.

Response by PMI and IFRC

PMI and the IFRC Country Cluster Support Team (CCST) in Jakarta are coordinating with each other and also coordinating with BNPB to monitor and carried out emergency response needs in the field.

Immediate needs

Based on initial information from secondary sources as well as from PMI teams on the ground, immediate needs include evacuation and management of injuries, medical and health services including referral services, food and non-food items and cleaning community water resource.","Mon, 28 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1232294-IBIDfl280119.png?itok=bAcRPo0F,"['ministry', 'indonesia', 'affected', 'level', 'bnpb', 'bulletin', 'water', 'landslides', 'floods', 'emergency', 'food', 'sulawesi', 'flood', 'information', 'province', 'flash', 'south']", 
1,1,FL-2019-000011-IDN,Coastal Flooding Forecast Strengthened in Indonesia - Indonesia - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/indonesia/coastal-flooding-forecast-strengthened-indonesia,"Indonesia is making progress in integrating coastal flood forecasting into its meteorological early warning system to increase protection against one of the major hazards impacting the country.

The Indonesian Coastal Inundation Forecasting Demonstration Project (CIFDP), led by the Indonesian Meteorological Climatological and Geophysical Agency, has successfully built a flood forecasting and warning capability for Jakarta and Semarang City, which face critical and ongoing flood challenges.

The five-year demonstration phase has just ended and will now develop into the Indonesian Coastal Inundation Forecasting System, which is expected to be operational by April 2019. It is hoped to improve communications of early warnings to the end-user and extend the forecasting system beyond Jakarta and Semarang-City. Consideration will also be given to integrating this system with a tsunami warning capability, thus enabling a full end-to-end coastal inundation Multi Hazard Early Warning System (MHEWS).

Indonesia has just over 99,000 km of coastline: the third longest in the world. Sitting amongst three tectonically active plates and within the ‘Pacific Ring of Fire’, Indonesia faces many natural hazards, with devastating impacts. Coastal flooding is a major risk, as a result of extreme weather and high tides, and earthquake triggered tsunamis, as was highlighted yet again in 2018 with tragic results.

Improving safety-related services is a fundamental priority of WMO. The Joint WMO-IOC Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) and the WMO Commission for Hydrology (CHy) initiated the Coastal Inundation Forecasting Demonstration Project (CIFDP) in recognition of a growing global coastal population and related need to develop efficient early warning systems.

CIFDP proved unique in bringing together stakeholders across a wide range of Indonesian government agencies and non-governmental organizations, as well as the hydrological and oceanographic communities. It demonstrated how the forecasting and warning system will provide significant benefits to coastal populations in Jakarta and Semarang City and support the Sendai Framework on disaster risk reduction.

“This early warning for coastal flooding will be an integral part of the meteorological early warning system (MEWS) that has been built previously. We are working on increasing accuracy and evaluation completeness of supporting infrastructure,” said BMKG Deputy Director R Mulyono Prabowo at a meeting to assess the outcomes of the demonstration project.

The meeting in Bali, from 28 to 30 January, brought together representatives of different government agencies, end users and technical experts involved in developing the system and the end-user stakeholders, gathered with BMKG, WMO and international partners to share the results of 5 years of collaborative effort.

“‘CIFDP has enabled the development of an operational coastal warning system and strengthened the institutional development of BMKG staff over the past 5 years,” said Sarah Grimes of WMO. Five BMKG staff were trained in the project, up from one at the beginning. BMKG funded the work, with some contribution from the government of The Netherlands.

“This project is an excellent example of forecast providers working closely with the end user community from the beginning, and with the international experts, to jointly develop the forecast system. This has created a true sense of ownership of the project by Indonesia and supports sustainability and further enhancement of the Coastal Inundation Forecasting system,” said Val Swail, Co-Chair of the project Steering Group.","Fri, 08 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/flood.png,"['indonesia', 'system', 'inundation', 'bmkg', 'flooding', 'wmo', 'indonesian', 'early', 'coastal', 'forecasting', 'warning', 'project', 'forecast', 'strengthened']",

Hydrometeorological disasters such as floods, landslides and strong winds have hit several areas across Indonesia. Dozens of people have been killed and thousands displaced in the last week.



The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) warned that according to rainfall patterns in the last 20 years, January and February were the peak months for hydrometeorological disasters.



“The rainy season has begun in almost all regions in Indonesia, with a tendency for extreme rain,” BMKG spokesman Taufan Maulana told The Jakarta Post on Monday. “There are also other factors, such as tropical cyclones, problems with urban spatial planning and the government’s readiness to minimize the impact of extreme weather.”

National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho earlier said deforestation and damage to watersheds had contributed to the increasing number of hydrometeorological disasters over the years.



The large areas deemed critical land, which the Environment and Forestry Ministry defines as land that has ecologically reduced function, was also a contributing factor.



The BNPB recorded that the worst hydrometeorological disaster in the past few weeks was in South Sulawesi, with at least 69 people killed and 6,700 others displaced by floods and landslides that hit 12 regencies and one city across the province last week. Of the deaths, 46 were in Gowa, 14 in Janeponto, four in Maros and one in the provincial capital city Makassar.



On his visit to the affected areas on Sunday, Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the degraded environment at Bawakaraeng Mountain in Gowa -- where the Jeneberang River begins and runs through many regions across the province, including Makassar -- increased the likelihood of floods and landslides.

""Besides the weather that we cannot control, the disasters were also caused by damage in the upstream area comprising the Bawakaraeng watershed,"" he said as quoted by Antara.

Kalla said people should refrain from converting land with woody plants to cultivate agricultural crops like corn.

In the disaster last week, some parts of Gowa were inundated after the Jeneberang River overflowed.

Heavy downpours in Central Java over the weekend also caused floods in Kendal and Batang regencies, as well as Pekalongan city, killing at least two children and affecting thousands of residents.

Rainwater flooded a number of schools in the three regions on Sunday, forcing some to close the next day.

On Sunday, strong winds and heavy rains also hit Lagoa village in North Jakarta and Pamekasan regency in East Java, with several buildings collapsing. No casualties were recorded.

In West Nusa Tenggara (NTB), torrential rain and strong winds also struck villages at the foot of Mount Rinjani, which is popular among climbers and tourists.

On Monday, authorities reported more than 4,000 people in four subdistricts in Gorontalo’s Boalemo regency were affected by floods. Dozens of houses reportedly were damaged in the disaster.



The BMKG forecast that extreme weather, strong winds and heavy rain could occur in 14 provinces in the next few days: Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, Bangka Belitung, Banten, Jakarta, Central Java, East Java, Bali, NTB, East Nusa Tenggara, Southeast Sulawesi and South Sulawesi.

The BMKG also warned of the potential for 2.5 to 4 meter high waves in areas across Indonesia.



“The public should be careful of heavy rain and strong winds that are likely to occur at the end of January. There is potential for floods, landslides, flash floods, fallen trees and slippery roads,” Taufan said.

Kudus, Central Java (ANTARA News) - Floods hit Jati Wetan, Dukuh Gendok, Tanggulangin, and Barisan villages in Jati Sub-district, Kudus District, Central Java Province, and forced at least 24 local residents to take refuge in a safer place.



Incessant heavy rains triggered floodwaters reaching 40 to 60 centimeters in height, Wahyu Adi, head of the Jati Sub-district, stated here, Monday.



The local authorities have set up a public kitchen for flood victims, he noted.



The Jati Wetan rural hall has been prepared to accommodate people displaced by the flooding.



Jatis Kapuan, Tanjungkarang, Jati Kulon, and Pasuruhan Lor villages in Jati Sub-district were also flooded.



Mejobo and Kaliwungu were the other sub-districts that experienced flooding.



A total of 1,707 families comprising 6,016 people in the villages of Golantepus, Mejobo, and Temulus were also affected by floods.



Meanwhile, on Sunday, thousands of houses in Batang and Pekalongan districts and Pekalongan municipality, also in Central Java, were flooded on Sunday morning following heavy rains that fell overnight.



The flooding affected the villages of Proyonangan Tengah, Kauman, Karanganyar, Watusalit, Kalipucang Wetan, Kalipucang Kulon, Klidang Lor, and Klidang Wetan in Batang District, with the water level reaching up to a meter in height, forcing hundreds of families to evacuate to higher grounds.



In Pekalongan Municipality, North Pekalongan Sub-district was hit the hardest by the flooding, with almost all villages, including Panjang Wetan, Kandang Panjang, Bendan, Bandengan, and Pabean flooded.



In Pekalongan District, the floods hit the villages of Wonokerto, Jeruksari, Tirto, and Kajen.



The floods also disrupted traffic on Central Java`s northern coastal highway, particularly in the two districts and municipality, as several sections of the highway were submerged by floodwaters.



Earlier, the Indonesian Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency had warned of possible flooding, as the country is currently experiencing the peak of the rainy season until February.

Floods have swept pythons into residential areas in Greater Jakarta in the last three days, with two appearing in Koja, North Jakarta, on Wednesday morning.

Koko, a resident of neighborhood unit RT 01, community unit RW 03, in Koja, North Jakarta, said he found two pythons on Jl. Lorong Z Timur. ""[The pythons] might struggle with the flooding, so they leave their nests,"" Koko said as quoted by kompas.com.

He recalled that the snakes were found in different places at different times. The first was found inside a water channel, while the other was found by the river.

Koko claimed he was able to tame the pythons when locals tried to catch the animal, adding that snakes appeared quite regularly in the area during rainy season.

""There has yet to be any encounters [between locals and pythons], but the appearance of pythons is worrisome because many children live here,"" he said.

Previously, on Tuesday, a 4-meter python, which was purportedly carried by floodwaters, also made a surprise appearance in a housing complex in Kalideres, West Jakarta.

On Sunday, another python also made an appearance in a housing complex in Kaliabang, Bekasi, West Java. The python bit Maman, who was trying to catch it.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - At least 68 people have been killed and nearly 7,000 forced to take refuge in emergency shelters after floods, landslides and a tornado battered the Indonesian island of Sulawesi in the past week, authorities said on Sunday.

Rescue teams were still looking for seven missing people, while 47 had been injured during the devastation that saw heavy rains cause a dam to overflow, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency.

More than 5,000 homes had been submerged with scores of bridges, schools and places of worship damaged, as well as thousands of acres of rice paddies destroyed, he said in a statement.

Some displaced people had started to return to their homes as flood waters receded, but heavy equipment was needed to clear a thick layer of mud that had enveloped roads and houses, he said.

Others had chosen to remain in camps after being traumatized, Nugroho said, adding that there was still an urgent need for food, blankets and medical services.

This resulted in a flash flood that took many Makassar residents by surprise.

Landslides were also reported in the region.

The death toll in Indonesia rose to 59 Friday as more bodies were recovered from receding waters in the wake of torrential rain that brought landslides and flash flooding from an overwhelmed dam.

Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said 45 deaths are a result of flooding, 14 from landslides, the Associated Press reports.

Among the dead are two infants and a man who reportedly died from electrocution.

At least 25 people were missing as of Friday and 47 others are hospitalized.

""I've never seen something this bad — this is the worst,"" Syamsibar, head of South Sulawesi's disaster mitigation agency, told AFP news agency on Friday.

Many of the deaths occurred after officials opened floodgates Tuesday afternoon when heavy rainfall overwhelmed the Bili Bili dam, an earthen embankment on the Jeneberang River about 20 miles east of Makassar in the Gowa district.

The flash flood that resulted quickly rose to a height of more than 5 feet in the Makassar suburb of Katimbang, taking many of the residents by surprise.

In the Indonesian city of Makassar, where the rainy season often brings floods, Hasriani didn't worry when a day-long downpour last month saw water rise to her knees by the time she had picked up her children from school for afternoon prayers.

But within an hour, the water level had climbed above her head, threatening to drown her family inside their home, already built a meter off the ground.

""It wasn’t caused by the rain - it was Bili-Bili!"" said Hasriani, 30, referring to a dam completed in 1998 in order to prevent flooding, located 9 miles (14.5 km) away.

In late January, the dam overflowed, unleashing run-off from the mountains that swamped thousands of homes close to the city.

Disaster officials were shocked that one intense bout of rain could cause the dam to fail. But the provincial governor and environmental experts believe it could have been predicted.

Earth shaken loose by years of forest-felling in the mountains above the city had been washed down into the dam's reservoir, they said, silting it up and displacing water.

The dam burst swallowed up thousands of homes and hectares of rice fields across South Sulawesi province, killing about 80 people and affecting more than 13,000 - the worst disaster in at least 15 years.

On mountain slopes, unanchored soil triggered landslides that ate up houses and damaged bridges. Of the thousands forced from their homes, many had yet to return, said Ikhsan Parawansa, head of the disaster agency in Gowa district, where 56 died.

Residents were unprepared for the failure of the 20-year-old dam and the resulting scale of the flooding.

But the disaster holds lessons as the planet's climate heats up, and scientists warn of worsening extreme weather.

Speaking to the Thomson Reuters Foundation shortly afterwards, South Sulawesi Governor Nurdin Abdullah rejected the media's portrayal of the disaster as “natural”.

“That dam was intended to last 100 years,” he said.

A university lecturer in forestry, Abdullah - who took office in September - blamed human activities for exacerbating the effects of heavy rains.

“There is a lot of mining and land conversion that increases silting and fills the rivers with dirt,” he said.

Forests 'super-critical'

Turning forested land into fields or mining it for rock and sand removes the vegetation that holds the soil together.

Then, when it rains, the dirt is easily washed down into rivers and lakes, reducing their capacity to hold water.

The Jeneberang river system that flows into Bili-Bili has been designated as a conservation zone, with forests judged to be at “super-critical” risk of being cut down.

Nonetheless, mining and land conversion that flout regulations have continued, Abdullah said.

Putri Nurdin, a doctoral student at Japan's Kyushu University who is also the governor's daughter, analyzed three river systems stretching across the province and found that no more than a fifth of the land was still covered in forest.

""Where there should have been forest, I saw rice fields and housing,"" she said, describing a visit three days after the disaster. There were landslides all along the road, she added.

Indonesia is said to be both blessed and cursed with abundant resources, including gold, nickel, copper, and the rock and sand needed for cement.

Its natural riches have brought huge foreign investment to the country of 17,000 islands. But their exploitation has often sparked tensions between government and communities.

President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo put agrarian reform high on his agenda in the 2014 vote.

But with elections looming this April, he has yet to respond to demands for reform of land-use policy.

Regulation review

As Sulawesi's mountainous terrain makes oversight difficult, small-scale farmers have seized the chance to capitalize on the ground beneath their feet, to grow crops and mine sand.

When researcher Nurdin surveyed the mountains after the floods, she found unregulated mining activities that endangered the surrounding area, such as digging too close to pockets of sand that could cause landslides.

Governor Abdullah said January’s devastation had prompted a more aggressive review of permits and rules.

Central government funding would also allow the province to build a second flood-prevention dam near Bili-Bili, he added.

Nurdin called for education to help communities use land more responsibly. Tree-planting programmes, backed by the government and other organizations, are underway but cannot keep up with the fast pace of deforestation, she noted.

Abdullah, who formerly headed a small district in South Sulawesi, ran for governor on a pro-conservation platform.

He surprised voters by saying the province was no place for mining and palm oil production, and land developed for those purposes should immediately be restored by planting trees.

“Usually if the forest is still healthy and there’s rain for two hours, the river is still dry,” Abdullah said. “But now if there’s rain for two hours, it definitely floods.”

Parawansa, tasked with overseeing recovery in the worst-hit area, said Gowa district had set up trauma centers and shelters for those made homeless while their homes are repaired.

“We’re still trying to figure out why this happened, because it was so big, and we haven’t seen something like this in a long time,” he said.

The full scale of the damage is still being worked out. But Indonesia's ministry of environment and forestry has promised almost Rp 200 billion ($14 million) in recovery funds.

Hasriani, who lives on a street of now-destroyed shops where her family sells rice and petrol, lamented the loss of her merchandise, computer, TV, phone and many clothes.

The neighborhood, located in a dip, filled up like a sink.

This climate change profile is designed to help integrate climate actions into development activities. It complements the publication ‘Climate-smart = Future-Proof! – Guidelines for Integrating climate-smart actions into development policies and activities’ and provides answers to some of the questions that are raised in the step-by-step approach in these guidelines.

The current and expected effects of climate change differ locally, nationally and regionally. The impacts of climate change effects on livelihoods, food and water security, ecosystems, infrastructure etc. differ per country and region as well as community and individual, with gender a particularly important vulnerability factor. This profile aims to give insight in the climate change effects and impacts in Indonesia with particular attention for food security and water. It also sheds light on the policies, priorities and commitments of the government in responding to climate change and important climate-relevant activities that are being implemented, including activities being internationally financed.

Summary

The shocks of climate change are already being felt in Indonesia, with more frequent droughts, heat waves and floods, and will pose an increasing threat to the country’s development. A World Bank analysis ranked Indonesia 12th among 35 countries that face high mortality risks due to multiple hazards, including tsunamis, floods, landslides, droughts, and earthquakes. About 40% of Indonesia’s population is at risk of such hazards, and their number will increase under climate change which is likely to exacerbate droughts on southern islands, floods and cyclone intensity across the country, and sea level rise effects in coastal areas.

Food security and water availability will be heavily affected by temperature increase, shorter growing seasons, unpredictable rainfall, and salt-water intrusion. By 2100, climate change impacts will cost an estimated 2.5-7% of GDP1.","Tue, 05 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1241809-Indonesia.png?itok=Mwy9PW5w,"['indonesia', 'droughts', 'activities', 'security', 'change', 'profile', 'water', 'floods', 'effects', 'climate', 'impacts']",

Flooding affected the south-eastern portion of the region, displacing thousands in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Seismic activities were also detected in the region; most notably in the West Sumba Regency, East Nusa Tenggara in Indonesia, being the most active this week, recording seven (7) tremors of at least M5.0.

There was a deadly flooding and landslide in South Sulawesi, Indonesia which started on 22 Jan 2019 (more information on the next page).

The widespread flooding on 26 Jan 2019 in the eastern portion of the region were attributed, by respective meteorological agencies in the affected member states, to the prevailing Northeast Monsoon.

A total of 13 earthquakes of M5.0 and above were reported this week in Indonesia and the Philippines (BMKG and PHIVOLCS). The strongest recorded this week is a M6.7 earthquake which followed a M6.2 earthquake in West Sumba Regency, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia.

Floods and landslides that battered Indonesia's Sulawesi island have killed at least 70 people, authorities said Tuesday, as aerial footage underscored the scale of the disaster with whole villages wiped off the map.

Lashed by heavy rain, rivers swelled and burst their banks, inundating dozens of communities across 12 districts as well as parts of the provincial capital Makassar.

The bodies of 70 victims have been found, while six are still missing, Syamsibar, head of South Sulawesi's disaster mitigation agency, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, told AFP.

Drone footage showed landslides had buried Pattallikang village in hard-hit Gowa district, with only a few buildings - including a mosque - visible after an avalanche of mud and rock cascaded down a nearby hillside.

Nearly 9,500 people have been displaced by the extreme weather, and hundreds of houses, government buildings, schools and bridges have been damaged, the disaster mitigation agency said Monday.

Authorities say floodwaters are receding but a state of emergency will remain in place until February 6, while rescuers look for those still missing and help repair damaged infrastructure.

Indonesia floods, landslides death toll climbs to 59

Floods and landslides in Indonesia have now killed at least 59 people, the government said Friday, after heavy rain pounded Sulawesi island and forced thousands to flee their homes.

""I've never seen something this bad - this is the worst,"" Syamsibar, head of South Sulawesi disaster mitigation agency, told AFP, adding that 25 people were still missing.

Lashed by the heavy rain, rivers swelled and burst their banks, inundating dozens of communities in 11 districts of southern Sulawesi. Parts of the provincial capital Makassar have also been affected.

Gowa district suffered the heaviest casualties, with 44 people found dead, said Syamsibar, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.

Some 3,400 people have been evacuated from their homes and given refuge in schools, mosques and tents.

Rescuers and residents waded through streets filled with waist-deep water, some carrying their possessions above their heads.

""I couldn't save all my belongings, my house was swept away,"" Makassar resident Ayu Fiskarina told AFP.

Authorities say floodwaters are receding but the impact of the disaster has ranged far and wide, damaging houses, government buildings, schools and bridges.

The death toll stood at 30 on Thursday evening.

More than 3,000 people have been evacuated and at least 46 are being treated at local hospitals and health clinics.

The floods also damaged houses, government buildings, schools and bridges.

Death toll from Indonesian floods and landslides rises to 26

The governor of an Indonesian province inundated by torrential rains says the death toll from flooding and landslides has risen to 26.

South Sulawesi Gov. Nurdin Abdullah said in a TV interview Thursday that displaced people are still being evacuated.

Nine districts in the province including the capital Makassar have been affected by flooding that began late Tuesday, forcing thousands to flee their homes.

Adnan Purichta Ichsann, the chief of Gowa district near Makassar, has said operators of the Bili Bili rock-fill embankment dam were forced to release water on Tuesday, which contributed to flooding but avoided a worse disaster.

Adbullah told local media that siltation of the dam and deforestation of the upstream watershed had worsened the floods.

Linkedin News Desk (Agence France-Presse) Cairns, Australia ● Mon, February 4, 2019 10:10 849 ab327006fac3d4a4e8af45a51b16348a 2 World #Australia,#flooding,military,floods,crocodiles Free

Australia's military has been deployed to tackle devastating ""once-in-a-century"" floods that have inundated homes, schools and airports in the country's northeast, forcing hundreds to flee and bringing crocodiles onto the streets.

The Australian Defence Forces filled sandbags, deployed amphibious cargo vehicles and helped pluck flashlight-wielding residents from their rooftops Monday, as monsoon rains drenched the northern state of Queensland.

Australia's tropical north typically experiences heavy rains during the monsoon season, but the recent downpour has far exceeded normal levels.

The authorities were forced to open floodgates late Sunday, unleashing what they called ""dangerous and high velocity flows.""

Images from the city of Townsville showed cars mostly submerged and picket fences barely poking through waist-deep flood waters.

Desperate residents had to contend not only with flash flooding, landslides and power blackouts, but also reptilian predators that have been spotted in residential roads and cul-de-sacs.

The Townsville Bulletin said it had received reports of several saltwater crocodile sightings in the flood-ravaged area.

Emergency services struggled to respond, carrying out 18 ""swift water rescues"" overnight.

More than 1,100 people have called the emergency services for urgent help, according to state premier Annastacia Palaszczuk.

Around 400 Townsville residents have sought shelter at nearby Lavarak military barracks and the Red Cross is also assisting with the response and recovery effort.

""Small boats worked through the night to evacuate members of the community,"" said local commander Brigadier Scott Winter.

Palaszczuk warned the communities face more difficulties ahead. Schools and courts remain closed, more rain is on the way and emergency warnings still in effect for more than a dozen rivers.

The town of Ingham, just north of Townsville, got over 10 centimetres of rain in just a few hours on Monday morning, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.

Winds are expected to gust at up to 100 kilometres (62 miles) an hour on the coast.

Up to 20,000 homes are at risk of being inundated if the rains continue, officials said.

""It's basically not just a one in 20-year event, it's a one-in-100-year event,"" said Palaszczuk.

""This is unprecedented, we've never seen anything like this before,"" she said.

A year's worth of rain

The Bureau of Meteorology's Adam Blazak told AFP the downpours could continue until Thursday, while floodwaters will take some time to recede even when the rains lessen.

Some areas are expected to get a year's worth of rain in just over a week.

The region receives an average of about 2,000 millimetres (6.5 feet) of rain annually, but some towns are already on track to pass that.

""I've never seen anything like this,"" Townsville resident Chris Brookehouse told national broadcaster ABC, adding that his house was flooded with water more than one metre deep.

""The volume of water is just incredible. Downstairs is gone, the fridge and freezer are floating. Another five or six steps and upstairs is gone too.""

Blazak said that with adverse weather predicted to continue for up to 72 hours, some regions could see record-breaking levels of rainfall.

A silver lining to the deluge is that drought-stricken farmers in western Queensland have been boosted by the downpours.

The deluge comes amid a severe drought in the eastern inland of the vast Australian continent, including parts of Queensland, that has left graziers struggling to keep in business.

Extreme heatwaves during the southern hemisphere summer have led to maximum-temperature records being broken in some towns.","Mon, 04 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2019/02/04/2019_02_04_64659_1549248066._large.jpg,"['australia', 'townsville', 'told', 'steps', 'bring', 'water', 'military', 'floods', 'residents', 'towns', 'worth', 'state', 'rains', 'streets', 'rain', 'continue', 'crocs']",

Rescuers recovered more bodies as floodwaters and rainfall subsided in several areas, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman. He said 45 people died in floods and 14 others in landslides.

Operators at the overwhelmed Bili Bili rock-fill embankment dam were forced to release water late Tuesday, which contributed to flooding but avoided a worse disaster.

The rampant destruction of forests in the Leuser ecosystem, a major water source for Aceh, has led to frequent flooding in the province.

A team from the Leuser Conservation Forum (FKL) performed a ground check on damaged areas in the ecosystem and found that, in 2018, about 5,685 hectares of the ecosystem were deforested, with the most serious damage found in Gayo Lues with 1,063 ha of deforested area.

The ecosystem, located across several regencies in the province, also saw 889 ha damaged in Nagan Raya and another 863 ha in East Aceh. As of December 2018, 1.7 ha of forest remained in the Leuser ecosystem.

The FKL and another conservation group, the Aceh Forest, Nature and Environment Foundation (Haka), concluded from their observations that the high rates of deforestation over many years caused flooding.

Based on an observation of river basin areas, the highest rate of deforestation was found in the Singkil-Alas River Basin, which covers Gayo Lues, Southeast Aceh, Subulussalam, Aceh Singkil and the neighboring province of North Sumatra.

Singkil-Alas recorded 10 cases of flooding in 2018, the highest among all river basins in the province. The Peusangan River Basin, which covers North Aceh and Central Aceh, also experienced severe damage with deforestation resulting in the loss of 1,248 ha of forest in the same year. Six districts in the two regencies were affected by floods while another three experienced droughts.

The Leuser ecosystem is an important source of water for a population of 5 million in Aceh. It also functions as a disaster mitigation area, preventing floods and landslides.

There is growing concern that Aceh will experience more floods and landslides in the upcoming years if deforestation continues.

“That’s why Haka and the FKL urge the government and law enforcement bodies to be more serious in protecting forest areas and punishing illegal forest activities,” said Haka geographic information system manager Agung Dwinurcahya, adding that massive restoration was also needed for the damaged forests.

FKL monitoring coordinator T. Pahlevie said there had been an increase in findings of illegal logging, encroachment and forest clearing for roads in the province.

He said that, throughout 2018, the FKL found 2,418 cases of illegal logging that damaged 4,353.8 square meters of the forested areas, 1,838 cases of encroachment covering 7,546.3 ha and 108 cases of deforestation related to road construction projects along 193.85 kilometers.

The regency with the highest number of illegal logging cases was South Aceh with 473 cases, followed by East Aceh with 437 cases and Aceh Tamiang with 377, Pahlevie said.

The regency with the highest numbers of forest encroachment cases was East Aceh with 378 cases, followed by Gayo Lues with 326 cases and Southeast Aceh with 316.

The illegal poaching of wild animals is also a concern. The FKL, according to its wild animal protection team coordinator Dedy Yansyah, found a decreasing trend in poaching cases in 2018 but the number of traps seized slightly increased from 814 in 2017 to 834 in 2018.

“In 2018, the FKL found 613 cases of illegal poaching, a decrease from 729 cases last year,” Dedy said.

He added that, from 2014 to 2018, the FKL found 5,529 traps from forest areas, ranging from small traps to large ones for wild animals such as tigers.

He said the FKL team conducted the observation on illegal activities through monitoring and field patrols carried out at least 15 days a month.

“It was during the patrols that the team found thousands of traps set by illegal poachers throughout the forests of Aceh,” Dedy said, adding that most illegal forest activities were committed in protected forests, followed by production forests and the Leuser ecosystem.","Wed, 30 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2018/06/25/2018_06_25_48223_1529928852._large.jpg,"['aceh', '2018', 'rampant', 'forest', 'fkl', 'deforestation', 'cases', 'ha', 'floods', 'leuser', 'triggers', 'landslides', 'ecosystem', 'illegal']",

Hundreds of thousands of cattle weakened from a severe drought are feared to have died in record-breaking floods in northeastern Australia, authorities said Friday, as they stepped up efforts to feed surviving livestock.

Incessant rains over an almost two-week period have flooded swathes of Queensland state, with the full scale of the devastation on drought-hit cattle stations becoming clearer as floodwaters recede.

""We are expecting hundreds of thousands in terms of stock losses,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Sydney.

""This will be heartbreaking to these communities that have been experiencing years of drought, only to see that turn into a torrential inundation which threatens now their very livelihoods in the complete other direction.""

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk Friday spoke of seeing a ""sea of dead cattle"" when she toured one region on Thursday.

""To see the cattle spread across these yards, not moving, it made you feel sick in the stomach,"" she told national broadcaster ABC.

Bales of hay and fuel have been transported into towns near the disaster zones and are being distributed to farmers so they can carry out airdrops to their stock.

Farmer Rachael Anderson and her husband, who manage Eddington cattle station near Julia Creek township, said 800 of their 1500 cattle were still unaccounted for.

""The cattle didn't have anywhere else to go... We've got a railway line close to us and the whole railway line is just tangled with dead cattle,"" Anderson told AFP.

""If the floodwater wasn't enough to kill them, then those that got to higher areas were exposed to elements that were not conducive like rain hitting them at 60 kilometres an hour. They can't survive them long term.""

Anderson -- who had been hand-feeding cattle over the past few months amid the crippling drought -- said there were also many dead kangaroos as well as birds that were falling dead on the ground.

About half of Australia's 25-million strong cattle herd is bred in Queensland state, and graziers say the floods -- described as a once-a-century event -- could devastate their industry.

""This will finish a lot of people, there's some people who've lost everything, every beast they own, so there's no income at all,"" farmer William McMillan told the ABC.

Some countries also face civil unrest and associated humanitarian impacts, as well as limited government capacity to respond to disasters. Between FY 2009 and FY 2018, USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) and USAID’s Office of Food for Peace (USAID/FFP) provided humanitarian assistance in response to a range of natural and complex emergencies in the region. Examples include cyclones and typhoons in Burma, the Pacific Islands, the Philippines, and Vietnam; earthquakes in China, Indonesia, Japan, and Papua New Guinea; floods in Burma, Cambodia, Fiji, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Micronesia, and Vietnam; drought in the Marshall Islands, Palau, and Vietnam; volcanic activity in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vanuatu; winter emergencies in Mongolia; and conflict in Burma, the Philippines, and Timor-Leste.

USAID provided nearly $320.8 million to respond to disasters in the EAP region between FY 2009 and FY 2018. USAID/OFDA assistance included more than $183.6 million for programs in agriculture and food security; chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive hazards; economic recovery and market systems; health; humanitarian coordination and information management; logistics support and relief commodities; nutrition; protection; search and rescue; risk management policy and practice; shelter and settlements; and water, sanitation, and hygiene. USAID/FFP support included nearly $137.2 million for emergency food assistance and nutrition support in the form of in-kind food aid, locally and regionally purchased food, cash transfers, food vouchers, and other activities.

In the last decade, USAID responded to 110 disasters in EAP. USAID frequently deployed humanitarian teams to the region, including five Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs). USAID deployed DARTs to Indonesia following an earthquake in FY 2010; to New Zealand following an earthquake in FY 2011; to Japan in response to an earthquake and resulting tsunami and nuclear emergency in FY 2011; to the Marshall Islands in FY 2013 due to a drought; and to the Philippines in FY 2014 for Typhoon Haiyan.

All the victims were members of the same family.

The dead victims were identified as Ni Ketut Puspa Wati, 28, and Ni Komang Mertini, 19.

The Bali Disaster Mitigation Agency reported that a 6-meter hillside behind the house slumped and buried the house while the family watched television on Sunday evening.

“All the family members were in the house and were trapped inside,” the agency’s head, Dewa Putu Mantera said.

Around 15 minutes later, one of the residents, I Komang Andre, escaped from the house and raised the alarm among neighbors.

“A joint operation was immediately conducted by Karangasem Disaster Mitigation Agency and the police, as well as the Search and Rescue Agency,” he said.

Dewa said four victims were receiving medical treatment at Karangasem Hospital while other victims were treated at the community health center (puskesmas)

Several hydro-meteorological disasters, such as floods and landslides primarily caused by wind and rain, have hit Indonesia in recent days. Dozens of people have been killed and thousands displaced since last week.

The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) had previously warned that statistically, January and February is the peak time for hydro-meteorological disasters, given the rainfall patterns over the last 20 years.

“The rainy season has begun in almost all regions in Indonesia, with a tendency for extreme rain. There are also other factors, such as tropical cyclones, urban spatial planning and administrative readiness to minimize the impact,"" BMKG spokesman Taufan Maulana told The Jakarta Post on Monday.

National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said deforestation and damage to watersheds had contributed to the increasing number of hydro-meteorological disasters over the years.

The agency recorded that the worst disaster in the past week was in South Sulawesi, with at least 69 people killed and 6,700 others displaced in floods and landslides that hit 12 regencies and one city across the province. Of these deaths, 46 were in Gowa, 14 in Jeneponto, four in Maros and one in the provincial capital of Makassar.

On 22 December 2018 at 21:27 hours (local time), a tsunami hit the coast of the Sunda Strait affecting five sub-districts in Banten (Pandeglang and Serang) and Lampung provinces (Lampung Selatan, Tanggamus and Pesawaran). As a result, a total of 426 people were reported dead, 7,202 people injured, 40,386 people displaced and 23 people were missing1. Significant damage was reported on properties including houses, hotels, boats, vehicles, etc. Pandeglang and Lampung Selatan are the most affected with Pandeglang only recording more than 50% of casualties, IDPs, material losses and damages.

Humanitarian crises and disaster are not gender neutral, the chaos and disruption of economic and social systems create differential vulnerabilities, risks and needs among women, men, boys and girls and other vulnerable specific groups. Rapid gender analyses (RGAs) help CARE and humanitarian actors to better consider gender issues and thus design a response that meets the specific needs of affected women, men boys and girls. Consistent with its focus on gender equality, CARE initiated an RGA mission led by CARE International Rapid Response Team Gender Specialist in Angsana, Pasaruan, Imbul Tanjung respectively from the subdistrict of Panimgba (Pandeglang district) and Cinangka (Serang district) Among the key findings one should note the IDP women and men of all ages are living in poor conditions in evacuation centres and lack of adequate shelter and privacy for women and girls, poor access to water, hygiene and sanitation services which combined increased health and protection risks including gender-based violence (GBV). This has added up to the prevailing gender inequalities and imbalance between women and men, with women not involved into decision making at house and community, including the management of the assistance. There is an overwhelming sense of silence around domestic violence and child marriage as communities accept them as part of the social fabric; they rarely talk about its effects and consequences.

The recommendations below are formulated for the entire humanitarian community to improve the quality of the assistance by mainstreaming gender and protection into sectorial responses and implementing gender specific interventions.

KEY FINDINGS

IDP women and men are living in overcrowded buildings, including schools and lack basic NFI with children, elderly and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) at particular health risk Assistance so far is not gender sensitive:

a. Food distributions do not consider specific nutrient needs of children, elderly and PLW

b. Not enough water for menstrual hygiene, latrines are not separated by sex, nor do they have internal locks and light Women are not involved in decision making regarding the assistance, nor are they participating in decisions within their own family The lack of awareness of human rights, including in relation to violence against women (VAW) and gender-based violence (GBV), combined with strong beliefs on traditional norms and new vulnerabilities among IDP women and men due to the disaster will reinforce pre-existing GBV (domestic violence, child marriage, female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), sexual violence, etc.) Several legal provisions on gender equality and GBV do exist, though there is a conflict with customary law and existing laws are not enforced

RECOMMENDATIONS

Overarching Recommendation

Up-to-date gender analysis of the shifting gender dynamics within affected communities will ensure humanitarian assistance is tailored to the specific and different needs of women, men, boys and girls. It is recommended that organisations continue to invest in gender analysis, that new reports are shared widely and that programming is adapted to the changing needs.

Gender Mainstreaming Recommendations

Improve access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) among IDPs through temporary water tracking or multiplication of water pipe, construction of toilet and latrines with respect to standards of dignity and protection (number, separation by sex with visible signs, internal lock, lighting, etc.).

Provide dignity kits for women and girls of reproductive age, including disposable napkins, until access to water is improved.

Food distribution should consider specific nutrient needs for children under five, pregnant and lactating women (PLW) as well as elderly in line with policy of the Indonesian Ministry of Health.

Provide IDPs with dignified temporary shelter (with separation room for women and men) and non-food items (NFIs) (mattress, blanket, kitchen kits, hygiene kits) to improve living condition and mitigate health and protection risks.

Support affected women and men of relevant ages with targeted livelihood support including cash grant for income generation, fishing equipment and agricultural inputs, etc.

Linkedin Arya Dipa and Kharishar Kahfi (The Jakarta Post) Bandung and Jakarta ● Tue, January 29, 2019 17:38 855 ab327006fac3d4a4e8af45a51b081a65 1 National #Citarum,Citarum-Harum,Citarum-River,environment,#environment,West-Java,#WestJava,river-pollution,#pollution Free

In January last year, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo said the key to settle all the environmental problems of the Citarum River -- the longest river in West Java -- was integration of efforts by ministries, institutions and all government branches both at the central and local levels.

The 270-kilometer river is being heavily polluted, mostly by household garbage and waste from textile factories, despite its importance for the lives of at least 27 million people in West Java and Jakarta.

“If they can integrate, I predict the rehabilitation of the river can finish well within seven years,” Jokowi said at that time.

One month later, he officially established an extensive rehabilitation campaign nicknamed Citarum Harum involving, among others, the central government, local administrations, the Indonesian Military (TNI) and the police.

The scheduled deadline, however, may be pushed back because of a lack of cooperation among the stakeholders.

West Java Governor Ridwan Kamil was the first to admit that the issue existed.

“There is no centralized coordination [for the project],” he said during a recent one-year evaluation of the Citarum Harum rehabilitation program.

His concern was echoed by Col. Yusef Sudrajat, a local military officer assigned to the project who is responsible for the work in one of Citarum’s 23 zones. He claimed to have never received orders from his superiors about the Citarum program.



“There has been only one coordination meeting with the task force commander since I was assigned to this project 10 months ago,” Yusef said.

The commander of the Siliwangi Military Command overseeing West Java and Banten, Maj. Gen. Trie Soewandono, said the TNI had assigned more than 3,000 personnel to contribute to the Citarum program.



The lack of communication, Yusef said, has affected the work in the field and left participants with less access to funding.

Yusef said that Citarum's budgetary allocation did not include money for fuel for heavy equipment that would be used by the military across Citarum’s 23 zones to dredge sediment and debris from the river.

“The dredging is important to prevent heavy flooding in several regions in Bandung, including Baleendah,” he said, adding that the dredging was actually a task for regional administrations rather than for military personnel.

In order to solve the problem, Ridwan said he would hold a coordination meeting between related stakeholders next month in Bandung, during which they were expected to draft an action plan.

A public policy analyst and the executive director of Perkumpulan Prakarsa, Ah Maftuchan, said he suspected the poor coordination started at the central government level and between ministries and relevant institutions, adding that “sectoral ego” might be the root cause.

“This should be addressed by the relevant coordinating ministries. However, it seems they have yet to do their task well,” he said, adding that Jokowi might have to make an extra effort to monitor the Citarum program.

The Citarum River supplies about 80 percent of the raw water to Jakarta and its surrounding areas and irrigates rice farms in Karawang, West Java that produce 5 percent of Indonesia’s rice. It is also the source of power for three hydroelectric plants that can generate a total of 1,400 megawatts of electricity.

Yet, the Citarum's pollution has been an issue for years and textile factories in Bandung and Cimahi are considered to be the major toxic waste contributors.

West Java Police chief Insp. Gen. Agung Budi Maryoto said the force launched 58 investigations into people and companies suspected of polluting the Citarum last year.

However, he said the police would also need assistance from investigators of the Environment and Forestry Ministry to solve more cases and name more suspects.

Twenty people were killed and 112 others wounded when two bombs exploded in a cathedral in Jolo,

Sulu in the southern Philippines on 27 January. The blasts, which used improvised explosive devices, occurred as churchgoers were attending mass, with the second exploding as government forces responded to the initial blast. The attack came a week after a plebiscite ratified the Bangsamoro Organic Law that will create a regional government to replace the current Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao.

20 people killed

As of 28 January, 19,000 people have been displaced by flooding in the provinces of Davao del Norte and Compostela Valley following continuous heavy downpour brought by the tail-end of a cold front. Two people have reportedly been killed by landslides, and a 12-year old girl remains missing after being swept away by flood waters. Around 8,000 people are still in evacuation centres or are being hosted by friends and relatives.

MYANMAR

Armed clashes between the Arakan Army (AA) and the Myanmar Military reportedly continued over the past week in Rathedaung, Buthidaung, and Ponnagyun townships in Rakhine State, and in Paletwa Township in Chin State.

As of 25 January, approximately 5,200 people remain displaced by the fighting in Rakhine State. Kyauktaw is the township hosting the highest number of displaced people. Ongoing humanitarian and development activities in the affected areas have been impacted by access restrictions.

5,200 people displaced

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

On 23 January, volcanic activity was reported on Manam Island, located off the northeast coast of mainland Papua New Guinea. Eruptions continued for over 24 hours, emitting ash and increasing the risk of mudflows.

Around 1,000 people from Baliau and Dugulava villages have reportedly been affected. Residents on the island have been advised to avoid venturing into or doing activities in the four main valleys for prolonged periods. The likelihood of continued volcanic activity in the future remains high. The National Disaster Centre (NDC) is monitoring the situation and coordinating with provincial authorities to verify extent of damage and provide assistance.

With just over two months before voting day, more people have come out to denounce the way the elections are being run, saying that come April 17, they will simply stay away from polling stations.



Social media is flooded with people expressing dissilusionment at the lack of a real choice, the lack of appeal for them to vote and that their interests have been ignored or sidelined by candidates and political parties.



This is true particularly with the presidential race, which presents the same two candidates as in 2014. The legislative elections are not necessarily better, but either way, they will be affected by the boycott as the two elections will be held on the same day.



Incumbent President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, who began the election campaign with a massive lead, has the most to worry about as many of his traditional supporters have expressed disappointment at some of his recent decisions, including his choice of conservative Muslim cleric Ma’ruf Amin as running mate and the planned parole for terror convict Abu Bakar Basyir (although the decision was postponed 24 hours later).



Those who voted for Jokowi in 2014, believing he would address human rights issues and rising cases of persecution against religious minorities and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community have been disappointed with his performance in the last five years. Some say they will boycott the elections.



Others are concerned that Jokowi appears to be veering further to the right, playing into the hands of Muslim conservatives and the military.



Rather than giving their vote to challenger Prabowo Subianto, disillusioned voters have declared themselves golput, a term coined during general elections under Soeharto that referred to protest votes against the electoral system designed to ensure his victory.



Golput, short for golongan putih, is a bastardization of the word Golkar, Soeharto’s political machine that won all six general elections for him, giving legitimacy for him to rule for more than three decades.



In those days, disillusioned voters would go to polling stations to spoil their ballots, ensuring that they were registered and that their ballots were cast, while stopping government electoral officials from casting the ballots for them.



To ensure complete victory for Golkar and Soeharto, the elections were held on a working day and civil servants would vote at their offices. In Indonesia’s occupied East Timor (now Timor Leste), zealous electoral officials bragged of 105 percent voter turnout, all for Golkar.



This time around, many who have professed to be golput say they would vote with their feet in April.



But by doing so, they would miss out on the opportunity to send the clearest signal to the political establishment of their disenchantment with the electoral system.



Instead, they will be lumped with the hordes of apathetic people who long ago decided that their votes mattered little one way or another and that they would accept the results come what may. They are more likely taking advantage of the national holiday on voting day by leaving town.



For the good of democracy, Indonesia should capture dissillusioned voters. Unlike apathetic voters, they still believe in democracy. Their voices need to be heard, if only because they care.



In India, where they have introduced e-voting, voters are offered a none of the above (NOTA) option on the menu of candidates or parties. In some districts, NOTA beat all the candidates.



Capturing the voice of dissilussioned voters is not such a novelty in Indonesia.



Committees running elections for governors, mayors or regency chiefs in 2017 and 2018 provided a box as an option in areas where there was only one candidate running. In one or two areas, the boxes received more votes and were declared the winner. The elections had to be repeated.



The General Elections Commission (KPU) has expressed concern at the growing number of people declaring themselves to be golput and it has launched a massive campaign to encourage voters to exercise their democratic rights.



The two presidential candidates and those candidates running for the various legislatures have also been going around warning that those who join golput will miss out on the opportunity to decide on the national leadership and therefore forfeit their right to complain.



Unlike in neighboring Australia and Singapore, voting is not compulsory in Indonesia. Not voting, therefore, is a right that has to be respected.



In 2014, voter turnout was 70 percent, a respectable figure for an open democracy. In local elections, turnouts veered to the 50 percent mark. Sadly, electoral statistics can not distinguish between those who were simply apathetic to begin with and those who wanted to vote but are now too dissilusioned to come out on April 17.



Understandbly, the KPU is concerned that a low turnout would be used as an indicator of its poor performance. Others say a low turnout would cast doubt about the legitimacy of elected officials.



But rather than trying to scare people into voting, the KPU should find a way of accommodating the voices of dissillusioned voters. A NOTA option on the ballots would result in both a higher turnout and a measure of the disenchanted voters. This can only be good for democracy in 2024.","Mon, 04 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2019/01/20/2019_01_20_63503_1547995622._large.jpg,"['turnout', 'candidates', 'vote', 'running', 'way', 'golput', 'electoral', 'elections', 'voting', 'candidate', 'voters']",

When this topic inevitably turns to Indonesian textiles, the wax dying technique of batik normally comes to mind.

However, it’s not the only one. Indonesia also boasts a rich variety of tenun (handwoven fabric).

Often seen in both subdued earthy tones and vibrant hues, a single piece of tenun comes with intricate patterns unique to each region and culture across the archipelago. The production process is no less complicated, as each pattern is created with different colored threads woven into one singular cloth.

Tenun has a long history in Indonesia, with archaeological sources providing evidence the art form appeared around the Neolithic age at the earliest.

“However, there is no concrete evidence in Indonesia, although such evidence has been found in mainland Asia. What was found was a small bronze statue called The Bronze Weaver in Flores that dates back to the 6th century. This statue shows a breastfeeding woman seated at a loom,” explained Mariah Waworuntu, secretary-general of the Traditional Textile Arts Society of Southeast Asia.

The process of creating tenun is also quite complicated, with it possible for a single tenun cloth to take months to complete using traditional weaving devices. What’s more, some tenun cloth plays an important role in the culture they originate from, making their creation much more sacred, and rare.

Not wanting Indonesian tenun to be left in the shadows, an initiative is seeking to promote it, with the apparent objective of having a day dedicated to the fabric, just like Batik Day, which is celebrated every Oct. 2.

Headed by fashion designer Anna Mariana, the committee behind National Tenun Day proposed that the day be celebrated every Sept. 7.

Traditional Indonesian Textile Community chairman Tengku Ryo said the proposed date originated from a story dating back to 1929, in the National Awakening period.

“In that period, the need for cloth was as important as education and healthcare. As history would have it, discussions on the topic moved from Bandung to Surabaya, where Dr. Sutomo officiated the opening of the first ever weaving school in the city on that day,” Tengku said.

The impetus for a dedicated day celebrating Indonesian tenun has come from the huge boost National Batik Day has given to popularity of batik clothes and artisans.

Anna said this popularity was precisely what was needed to preserve Indonesia’s tenun tradition.

“Nearly every region in our 34 provinces has their own variety of tenun. [...] The most basic reason is to save and preserve our beautiful culture and tradition that no other nation possess,” said Anna, who showcased designs utilizing Bali and Betawi tenun and songket (gold-threaded woven fabric) at the DC Fashion Week last year.

However, a surge in popularity may also bring unwanted risks.

Cut Kamaril Wardani of Cita Tenun Indonesia said following UNESCO’s listing of batik on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, cheap batik-patterned clothes flooded the market.

“If you’re wearing batik that costs less than Rp 100,000 (US$7.06), it’s likely a cheap import. This is an issue because consumers are proud to wear imports [over genuine Indonesian products],” Cut said, adding that she wanted to avoid the same fate should plans for National Tenun Day go through.

Key Points

Concerns over imminent Indonesian import permit problems recede as government takes no action during January.

Vietnam and Malaysia have agreed on import protocols for live cattle from Brazil.

Indonesia : Slaughter Steers AUD $3.91/kg live weight (Rp10,100 = $1AUD)

The market continues to be depressed by the wall of cattle being presented to the butchers as the 81,000 head imported in October exerts its full influence.

Fat steer prices range from Rp39,000 to Rp41,500 with even lower prices for longfed animals. I have used Rp39,500 as the indicator rate for January with expectations that this rate will fall again next month as the October flood continues its slow progress to market.

It may take well into March until the October imports are fully eliminated from the feedlots.

This depressed market sentiment combined with the seasonal price rises for feeders in Australia has led to a low January import number of close to 30,000.

At the time of writing this report in the first week of February, it looks like being a very quiet import month as the monsoon is just in the process of arriving in northern Australia.

With major flooding in the cattle port city of Townsville and wet conditions in the top end of the Northern Territory, supply will be limited with logistics severely restricted and prices on the rise.

Normally this reduction in numbers would not be a problem but in 2019 Ramadan begins on the 4th of May and ends on the 4th June. Lebaran begins on the 5th of June.

Peak demand during this festival period is the last 10 days of Ramadan and the first few days of Lebaran.

An average feeding period of 120 days means that feeder cattle need to be imported at the beginning of Febrary to meet the peak market at the end of May.

My most recent report of northern Australian feeder prices indicated that AUD$3.25 was about the money but this was just prior to the heavy rainfall events.

If the rain continues, this rate could easily pass $3.50 with $4 an easy mark when the drought is finally broken. If February produces the very low import numbers seen in January the supplies available at the end of May will be severely restricted with great pressure for price increases of fresh beef.

It is interesting to note that for the first time in decades, the price of imported live cattle ready for slaughter in Indonesia is now consistently the lowest in the region. And all of the other markets have been importing unlimited quantities of Indian buffalo beef for many years. It seems that importers only have themselves to blame as hugely excessive imports during July, August and October appear to be the primary factor causing the current market pain.

On a brighter note, importers are breathing a sigh of relief as the government seems to be in no hurry to take action against those who have failed to meet their 1 to 5 breeder to feeder import requirement.

The best (and most optimistic) advice that I have is that the government won’t act until the individual importer annual import permit allocations have been fully utilised.

As I understand it, the majority of importers commenced their annual import permit process in the third quarter of the calendar year, therefore, if the government intends to wait until the annual permit cycle ends before taking action, the majority of importers can continue to operate normally until at least July and possibly as late as September.

This outcome no doubt suits the government as it means it will not result in any bureaucratic restriction of imports prior to Ramadan and Lebaran and will also push the decision back to a date after the upcoming general election on the 17th of April 2019.

For the first time in Indonesian history, the President, Vice President and members of the People’s Consultative Assembly will all be elected on the same day by more than 190 million eligible voters.

Northern producers can also relax as this delay until the third quarter also avoids any drastic reductions in demand until after the 2019 seasonal marketing cycle.

As the national herd forecast shows below, total numbers will be at their lowest from 2019-2021 so producers will be shielded from any potential reduction in imports to Indonesia during 2020 by a severe shortage of supply regardless of whether the drought breaks or not.

Vietnam: Slaughter Steers AUD $4.36/kg (VND16,500 to $1AUD)

Strong demand and supply continue across Vietnam as the Tet New Year festival period approaches (2nd to the 10th February).

I have lifted the indicator rate for slaughter steers from Dong71,000 to Dong 72,000 this month to recognise the strength of the higher priced northern market. January saw the 100,000 feedlot capacity increase from 70 to 80pc as importers stocked up for the holiday period.

The significant news for this month is that negotiations are now well advanced to allow Vietnamese importers to receive live cattle from Brazil.

My sources suggest that while there is still some final processes required to complete the negotiations, the first shipment might arrive as early as mid 2019. Similar negotiations with Malaysia could reduce the logistics burden of one country taking large shipments at once as two or three port discharges for very large vessels is not a deal breaker.

China: Slaughter Cattle AUD $5.39 / kg (RMB 4.87 = AUD$)

There has been little change in slaughter cattle rates during January despite the red meat market disruption caused by the ongoing African Swine Fever (AFS) outbreak. As Simon Quilty reported in mid January, the full impact on pig numbers will take quite some time to work its way through the production system so it might be 2020 before the national pig population hits the bottom and exerts maximum disruption on the meat markets both in China and elsewhere around the world.

The recent NACC shipment of slaughter cattle from Port Alma in Queensland to northern China was perfectly timed to provide product for this year’s Chinese New Year festival which runs from the 5th to the 19th of February 2019. It is a timely demonstration of how the difficult and complex export health protocol can actually work in northern Australia as these cattle were delivered to northern China where the weather is too cold for the Bluetongue insect vectors to survive.

Changes still need to be made to the protocol to ensure that trade can continue in a normal fashion i.e. not only is there a requirement that the entire shipment is processed in 14 days but Quarantine then requires that the abattoir holding yards to be empty for 30 days before the next shipment can arrive. Clearly these issues are a restriction on trade rather than a disease risk management measure.

When China decides to remove these trade restricting factors from this protocol the producers, exporter and ports around Australia will be kept very busy with the demand for live cattle. With the initial focus being on slaughter cattle, Port Alma is very well placed to provide an excellent service to this specialist trade.

Philippines : Slaughter Cattle AUD $4.40 / kg (Peso 37.5 to AUD$1)

The peso rate for slaughter cattle has risen this month to Peso165 per kg live weight (from 157 last month). My agent in the Philippines tells me that this is due to simple lack of supply as buyers continue to show strong demand for fresh beef while the local cattle herd simply can’t keep up. The ongoing strength of the Philippine economy is no doubt the major factor driving this.

Thailand: Slaughter Steers AUD $4.07/kg (Baht 22.6 to $1AUD)

Thai slaughter cattle prices remained fairly steady during January with the increase in the AUD rate above mainly driven by the stronger Baht.

Observation

While I was back in Australia for a Christmas break I visited a large number of supermarkets to see what was on offer in their beef departments.

After observing about 20 supermarkets focusing on Coles and Woolworths it seemed to me that there was a huge difference in the presentation of the beef on display

. In almost every case, Woollies appeared well stocked and presented while Coles were almost always understocked, messy with generally a lesser volume and range of product.

It seemed to me that the management at Woolworths were carnivores while those at Coles were vegetarians but of course this is a purely subjective observation on my part. Have a look for yourself and make your own judgement.

At least 176 people out of 16,692 dengue cases across the country have died this year, the Health Ministry reported on Tuesday.

The number had increased from the 169 fatalities reported one day earlier.

The ministry’s director for vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, Siti Nadia Tarmizi, said the large number of deaths was mainly caused by treatment for the patients being delayed.

Siti said the infection caused a flu-like illness and occasionally developed into a potentially lethal complication called severe dengue if not treated immediately.

“In most of the cases that led to death, the patients were usually admitted to health facilities too late. If they have experienced dengue shock syndrome and the bleeding is already severe, it is difficult to restore the fluid balance,” she said.

Siti said it is important for people to be aware when they feel symptoms such as severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands or rashes. The symptoms usually last two to seven days following an incubation period of four to 10 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.

“Do not wait until the dengue rash pops out because if you have been eating nutritious food and have a strong immune system, the dengue rash will not be seen on the skin. Please check yourself immediately into a health facility,” she said.","Fri, 08 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/epidemic.png,"['indonesia', 'days', 'patients', '176', 'severe', 'death', 'health', 'rises', 'symptoms', 'rash', 'usually', 'toll', 'number', 'reported', 'dengue']",

GPs band together to help as Townsville floods cause widespread devastation

Matt Woodley 6/02/2019 4:10:06 PM Scores of GPs have coordinated their own response to the devastating floods, providing vital care to a city inundated with a year’s worth of rain in a little over a week.

The freak downpour has been so severe that by 9.00 am Monday morning, Townsville had recorded 1134 millimetres in just nine days – the single largest rainfall event ever recorded in the area.



North Queensland’s Generalist Medical Training centre is based in the regional city – parts of which are still underwater – meaning nearly 400 GPs could potentially have been impacted in some way. To date, at least 2000 homes have been damaged by rain or floodwaters, and at least 9000 homes have been without power since the weekend.



The widespread devastation has prevented authorities from organising the scores of GPs who volunteered to assist at evacuation centres after the worst of the rain hit on Sunday night.



Dr Kenny Clark told newsGP Townsville’s disaster relief centre was so overwhelmed by Monday morning that they directed volunteers to ‘go anywhere’, meaning the city’s GPs had to quickly coordinate among themselves.



Within roughly two hours an ad hoc Facebook thread had attracted about 60 comments from GPs volunteering to go wherever they were needed.



‘We woke up on Sunday morning to just devastation, really,’ Dr Clark told newsGP.



‘The anxiety really went up because we started getting warning text messages every hour telling us to evacuate to higher ground.



‘We just knew whole suburbs were underwater and that lots of people would have lost everything.’



In less than a few hours the GPs efforts had ensured they were spread all over the city, doing whatever they could with the little resources they had to provide hundreds of desperate people with much needed care.



‘Before we went to one of the evacuation centres, myself and another GP, Aimee Smith, went to my clinic and just grabbed everything that we thought would be useful,’ Dr Clark said.



‘When we turned up there was just a queue off around 60 people, waiting for medications, mainly ... a lot of the problems were diabetics left at home without insulin, so we were giving them insulin from our samples, writing scripts.



‘A few people needed essential medications for anxiety and antipsychotics. There was a lot of patients suffering from chronic conditions.



‘We were sat across from a supply table and there were women going up and grabbing baby food, kids grabbing clothes and trying on old lady shoes just to have shoes on – these folk literally just had the clothes on their back.’





L–R: GPs Dr Kenny Clark and Dr Aimee Smith have been putting in 14-hour shifts at disaster centres or unaffected GP clinics since the Townsville floods started.



Since the disaster started, Dr Clark and his colleagues have been putting in 14-hour shifts at disaster centres or unaffected GP clinics, or assisting friends and relatives. He is one of the fortunate residents whose house has not been impacted by floodwaters, but his parents’ home has been destroyed and it could be days or even weeks until they’re able to survey the damage.



Fortunately, Dr Clark’s practice also narrowly avoided joining the thousands of buildings swamped by unprecedented flash floods.



‘I went to see it on Sunday morning and miraculously the water stopped five metres short of the walls. If it had been 10 centimetres higher our clinic would be completely ruined,’ he said.



‘I usually keep calm, but Saturday night there was a lot of anxiety because there was a news report from a car park 400 metres down from where my clinic is – it looked like he was standing on a boat, and there were just waves behind him and I thought our clinic had been completely destroyed.



‘We dodged an absolute bullet.’



Another GP who hasn’t been as lucky is RACGP Queensland Deputy Chair Dr Michael Clements, whose home and business have both been impacted by the disaster.



The long-time Townsville resident told newsGP the wild weather has been ‘harrowing’ and ‘10 times worse’ than anything he had seen in the area before – including 2011’s Tropical Cyclone Yasi.



‘The council sent out a lot of warnings, but none of us really believed it would get this high. We’re well above the 100-year flood level,’ Dr Clements said.



‘We had 17 people in our house on the flood night.



‘Water came within a couple of centimetres of our main floor and we almost had to move up to our second floor, but every single house around us has been flooded, it’s horrible.’



Dr Michael Clements’ neighbours were evacuated after having to seek refuge from encroaching floodwaters.



While flooding at Dr Clements’ home was restricted to his garage and front yard, one of his two practices – which only opened a month before the flood hit – has been heavily damaged.



‘[It’s] knee-deep in water and we don’t know when we’re going to be able to get back online again,’ Dr Clements said.



‘They say it’s still thick with putrid, contaminated water. We’ve seen excrement floating around, there are crocs in the water, so we don’t know – it might be days or even a week before we’re allowed back in to the main practice.



‘Being a practice owner you have some extra responsibilities about maintaining wellbeing for your staff, and while we all know that there’s insurance it doesn’t come straight away and payroll and bills still need to be paid, so it’s a bit stressful.’



However, while the disaster has had an immense impact on his practice and community, Dr Clements said the response and offers of help from his fellow GPs had helped immensely.



‘If I could have a message to pass on it’s that I really do appreciate the support from all the other GPs from across the country, it really does mean a lot,’ Dr Clements said.



At least 9000 homes remain without power, but with rain set to continue until the weekend many residents are still unsure as to when it will return, or even if their home will still be safe in a few days’ time.



However, despite the uncertainty surrounding almost every other aspect of the disaster, it seems clear that hundreds of Townsville GPs will be doing everything they can to ensure the city’s residents are receiving the best possible care, regardless of the once-in-a-lifetime circumstances they currently face.

33,33,FL-2019-000011-IDN,After the floods come the mosquitoes – but the disease risk is more difficult to predict - The Conversation AU,https://theconversation.com/after-the-floods-come-the-mosquitoes-but-the-disease-risk-is-more-difficult-to-predict-111173,"We’re often warned to avoid mosquito bites after major flooding events. With more water around, there are likely to be more mosquitoes.

As flood waters recede around Townsville and clean-up efforts continue, the local population will be faced with this prospect over the coming weeks.

But whether a greater number of mosquitoes is likely to lead to an outbreak of mosquito-borne disease is tricky to predict. It depends on a number of factors, including the fate of other wildlife following a disaster of this kind.

Mozzies need water

Mosquitoes lay their eggs in and around water bodies. In the initial stages, baby mosquitoes (or “wrigglers”) need the water to complete their development. During the warmer months, it doesn’t take much longer than a week before they are grown and fly off looking for blood.

So the more water, the more mosquito eggs are laid, and the more mosquitoes end up buzzing about.

But outbreaks of disease carried by mosquitoes are dependent on more than just their presence. Mosquitoes rarely emerge from wetlands infected with pathogens. They typically need to pick them up from biting local wildlife, such as birds or mammals, before they can spread disease to people.

Mosquitoes and extreme weather events

Historically, major inland flooding events have triggered significant outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease in Australia. These outbreaks have included epidemics of the potentially fatal Murray Valley encephalitis virus. In recent decades, Ross River virus has more commonly been the culprit.

A focal point of the current floods is the Ross River, which runs through Townsville. The Ross River virus was first identified from mosquitoes collected along this waterway. The disease it causes, known as Ross River fever, is diagnosed in around 5,000 Australians every year. The disease isn’t fatal but it can be seriously debilitating.

Cameron Webb (NSW Health Pathology)

In recent years, major outbreaks of Ross River virus have occurred throughout the country. Above average rainfall is likely a driving factor as it boosts both the abundance and diversity of local mosquitoes.

Flooding across Victoria over the 2016-2017 summer produced exceptional increases in mosquitoes and resulted in the state’s largest outbreak of Ross River virus. There were almost 1,700 cases of Ross River virus disease reported there in 2017 compared to an average of around 300 cases annually over the previous 20 years.

Read more: Explainer: what is Ross River virus?

Despite plagues of mosquitoes taking advantage of flood waters, outbreaks of disease don’t always follow.

Flooding resulting from hurricanes in North America has been associated with increased mosquito populations. After Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana and Mississippi in 2005, there was no evidence of increased mosquito-borne disease. The impact of wind and rain is likely to have adversely impacted local mosquitoes and wildlife, subsequently reducing disease outbreak risk.

Australian studies suggest there’s not always an association between flooding and Ross River virus outbreaks. Outbreaks can be triggered by flooding, but this is not always the case. Where and when the flooding occurs probably plays a major role in determining the likelihood of an outbreak.

The difficulty in predicting outbreaks of Ross River virus disease is that there can be complex biological, environmental and climatic drivers at work. Conditions may be conducive for large mosquito populations, but if the extreme weather events have displaced (or decimated) local wildlife populations, there may be a decreased chance of outbreak.

This may be why historically significant outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease have occurred in inland regions. Water can persist in these regions for longer than coastal areas. This provides opportunities not only for multiple mosquito generations, but also for increasing populations of water birds. These birds can be important carriers of pathogens such as the Murray Valley encephalitis virus.

In coastal regions like Townsville, where the main concern would be Ross River virus, flood waters may displace the wildlife that carry the virus, such as kangaroos and wallabies. For that reason, the flood waters may actually reduce the initial risk of outbreak.

Protect yourself

There is still much to learn about the ecology of wildlife and their role in driving outbreaks of disease. And with a fear of more frequent and severe extreme weather events in the future, it’s an important area of research.

Although it remains difficult to predict the likelihood of a disease outbreak, there are steps that can be taken to avoid mosquito bites. This will be useful even if just to reduce the nuisance of sustaining bites.

Cover up with long-sleeved shirts and long pants for a physical barrier against mosquito bites and use topical insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus. Be sure to apply an even coat on all exposed areas of skin for the longest lasting protection.","Thu, 07 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/257639/original/file-20190207-174883-z8gskc.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C162%2C5424%2C2712&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['outbreaks', 'wildlife', 'disease', 'risk', 'predict', 'virus', 'water', 'mosquito', 'floods', 'come', 'ross', 'local', 'difficult', 'river', 'mosquitoes']",

Floods are among the most common — and deadly — natural disasters in the world. Every year, they’re responsible for tens of thousands of fatalities and hundreds of millions of displaced homeowners. And they’re extraordinarily costly — in the U.S. alone from 2005 to 2014, the average flood claim was $42,000, and total flood insurance claims averaged more than $3.5 billion per year.

Accurate flood forecasting is a desirable goal, needless to say; according to some studies, early warning systems can reduce deaths and economic damages by over a third. Fortunately, it’s one scientists continue to inch toward with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). In a new paper (“ML for Flood Forecasting at Scale“) published on the preprint server Arxiv.org, researchers from Google, the Israel Institute of Technology, and Bar-Ilan University describe a machine learning system that accurately predicts riverine floods — that is, floods from overrun riverbanks.

The study is a retrospective on Google’s work in Patna, India late last year, where the Mountain View company piloted a flood-predicting model in partnership with the Central Water Commission of India. And it builds on research published by Harvard and Google in August 2018, which described an AI model capable of predicting the location of aftershocks up to one year after a major earthquake, and by Facebook AI researchers in December, who developed a method to analyze satellite imagery and quantify damage from fires and other disasters.

“Effective riverine flood forecasting at scale is hindered by a multitude of factors, most notably the need to rely on human calibration in current methodology, the limited amount of data for a specific location, and the computational difficulty of building … models that are sufficiently accurate,” the team wrote. “Machine learning is primed to be useful in this scenario: learned models [frequently] surpass human experts in complex high-dimensional scenarios.”

As the paper notes, one of the biggest challenges in building a flood prediction model is parameter calibration, an optimization process aimed at matching the algorithm’s predictions to certain baseline measurements. The standard approach involves significant manual work, and often results in models that aren’t generalizable.

The researchers overcame a few of those barriers by drawing on real-time measurements and short-term forecasts of river water levels, from which their model generates an inundation map — a map that shows where flooding may occur over a range of water levels — estimating the extent of the predicted flood. They claim that, based on alerts produced for the 2018 monsoon season, the forecasts are accurate down to a resolution of 300 meters, with over 90 percent and 75 percent recall and precision, respectively.

“[Th]e physical processes [of floods] are relatively well understood for several decades now, and relatively little calibration [was] required,” the study’s authors wrote.

That said, it’s not a perfect model, owing to high computational costs from the physics-based simulations and inaccuracies due to erroneous inputs. But the team believes that machine learning techniques hold the key to improving predictions in future work, and that those techniques might one day be used to forecast events not simulated by physics-based models, such as snowmelt and river discharge.

One imagines that the fruits of those labors will eventually make their way into Google’s Google Public Alert program, which informs users of apps like Google Search, Maps, and Google News of ongoing or impending natural disasters such as hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, and earthquakes. Government agencies in the U.S., Australia, Canada, Colombia, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, India, New Zealand, and Brazil currently participate.

“We believe ML can improve the quality of multiple components,” they said. “Toward making this possible, we are collecting, organizing and combining open data sets from different sources to make this problem more accessible for the ML community.”","Tue, 29 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/hurricane-harvey.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,"['google', 'work', 'model', 'learning', 'researchers', 'precision', 'predict', 'water', 'googles', '75', 'floods', 'ml', 'machine', 'flood', 'ai', 'models']",

An avalanche of mud and rocks has crashed into a hotel during a wedding celebration in southeastern Peru, killing at least 15 people, authorities say.

Civil defence chief Jorge Chavez said that dozens of people who had been dancing were caught under the collapsing wall and a roof early on Sunday at the Alhambra hotel in the Andean city of Abancay.

Chavez told RPP radio that at least 30 people had been pulled from the debris with injuries and were being treated at a nearby hospital.

Evaristo Ramos, the mayor of Abancay, said about 100 guests had been invited to the wedding party on Saturday and “there are 15 dead and 34 injured”.

Thirteen people died immediately after the wall collapsed under heavy rains.

Firefighters, police and residents worked through the night to rescue people still trapped under rubble.

Authorities said the Alhambra hotel was built very close to a hillside. A retaining wall collapsed, and the mudslide brought the hotel roof down on the party-goers below, they said.

People searching for missing relatives were urged to visit surrounding health centers to find and identify their loved ones.","Mon, 28 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/b6e2cb903d7341168ba79af76b211881_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['hotel', '15', '34', 'roof', 'wall', 'alhambra', 'peru', 'kills', 'celebration', 'wedding', 'guests', 'city', 'mudslide', 'collapsed']",

A strong 6.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the Indonesian island of Mentawai on Saturday, but no tsunami warning was issued.

The earthquake hit at a depth of 10 kilometres (six miles) in the Mentawai island region in West Sumatra province, some 100 kilometres southeast of the town of Tuapejat and 200 kilometres south of the major port city of Padang, according to the USGS.

Officials are still assessing the impact but there were no immediate reports of damage and casualties.

‘The quake was felt very strongly in Tuapejat. Our officers are still assessing the impact but so far everything is safe,’ said the head of Mentawai search and rescue agency Akmal, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.

The quake left residents of Padang, on the west coast of Sumatra, panicking for a moment.

‘It was very scary. This is the second quake we felt today. Our house was shaking, so we ran outside,’ Ira, a resident of Padang told AFP.

Indonesia is one of the most disaster-prone nations on Earth due to its position straddling the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, where tectonic plates collide.

Mentawai was hit by a tsunami in 2010 which killed more than 400 people and Padang suffered from a deadly earthquake in 2009 where more than 1,100 lives were lost.

Last year, the Indonesian archipelago was hit by an earthquake and tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi island which killed around 2,200 people.

At the end of the year, an erupting volcano in the middle of the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra islands killed more than 400 people.","Sat, 02 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.gulf-times.com/Content/Upload/Slider/220192135927572924161.jpg,"['indonesia', 'hit', 'strong', 'killed', 'padang', 'island', 'western', 'quake', 'rocks', 'earthquake', '61magnitude', 'kilometres', 'tsunami', 'mentawai', 'sumatra']",

In an attempt to make Jakarta an efficient city, the capital is to have a massive amount of infrastructure built and expanded within 10 years, Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan has said.

The idea was discussed and agreed to during a meeting on Monday hosted by Vice President Jusuf Kalla for several other officials, including the governors of Jakarta and Banten, the deputy mayor of West Java and the finance minister.

Anies explained that the budget for the decade-long project, which he said might amount to Rp 605 trillion (US$41 billion), would be financed by the central government and the city administration.

“If we want to be an efficient city, we would need Transjakarta to span 2,149 kilometers. Today we have just 1,100 km, which means additional buses are required,” he told the press briefing on Monday.

“Light rapid transit [LRT] is now only 5.8 km long; we need it to be more than 130 km long. The MRT is now about 16 km long and it has to be built to be 112 km long,” he added.

Moreover, Anies said there also had to be more than 20,000 public minivans to serve smaller areas.

He added that the city would have to build 600,000 housing units, as well as ensure 100 percent of the city got a clean water supply and more than 50 percent of it received wastewater service within the same length of time.

The governor said he had expected to prepare the budget and funding plans within a month with the relevant government ministries.

“[The infrastructure expansion] starts with Jakarta, then would extend to other regions,” he said.","Tue, 29 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2019/01/01/2019_01_01_62012_1546356370._large.jpg,"['jakarta', 'expected', 'long', 'infrastructure', 'expansion', 'km', 'need', 'efficient', 'massive', 'built', 'budget', 'city', 'governor']",

56,56,FL-2019-000011-IDN,Palm oil not the only driver of forest loss in Indonesia: Wildfire and mining join plantations as threat to forests; conservation policies and practices should reflect this - Science Daily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190201130603.htm,"Large-scale agriculture, primarily for growing oil palms, remains a major cause of deforestation in Indonesia, but its impact has diminished proportionately in recent years as other natural and human causes emerge, a new Duke University study finds.

""In the late 2000s, large-scale plantations were responsible for more than half of Indonesia's loss of primary natural forests,"" said Kemen G. Austin, a 2018 doctoral graduate of Duke's Nicholas School of the Environment, who led the study. ""This trend peaked from 2008 to 2010, when an average of 600,000 hectares of forest was lost annually -- 57 percent of it driven by the expansion of these massive farms.""

""From 2014 to 2016, an average of more than 800,000 hectares of primary forest was lost annually, but large-scale plantations accounted for only 25 percent of it,"" Austin said. ""So although the overall rate of deforestation grew, other causes were responsible for most of it.""

The conversion of forests to grasslands rose sharply in 2015 and 2016 when El Niño caused severe drought and higher-than-normal fire activity on many of the nation's islands, she noted.

Small-scale farming, which has largely been overshadowed by plantation-scale agriculture as a driver of deforestation, was also found to play a bigger role, accounting for about one-quarter of all forest loss. This suggests the importance of designing forest management interventions that take the values and requirements of small-holder farmers into account too, said Austin, who is now a senior policy analyst at RTI International.

Mining and logging roads were also found to be important drivers of deforestation at different times during the study, particularly on the local level.

""The takeaway message for policymakers and conservationists is that the causes of forest loss in Indonesia are much more varied than we previously thought. They change from place to place and over time,"" Austin said. ""Even though oil palm is the first thing that pops into most people's head when they think about deforestation in Indonesia, it's not the only cause, and we need to adjust our policies and practices to account for that.""

Austin and her colleagues published their peer-reviewed findings Feb. 1 in Environmental Research Letters.

Their study is the first to document the changing causes of deforestation occurring in Indonesia at the national scale and at the local level on each of the country's major developed islands. Some global studies previously have included nationwide data from Indonesia, Austin noted, but not at such a fine scale.

""Using 15 years of high-spatial-resolution Google Earth imagery and newly available global datasets on forest loss let us zero in on the causes of deforestation at each location and see how they vary from place to place and over time,"" Austin said. ""For instance, logging is still driving deforestation on the island of Papua, but on Sumatra and Kalimantan, it's the oil palm industry and El Niño-driven fires that are the primary drivers.""

Indonesia has experienced one of the highest rates of primary natural forest loss in the tropics in recent years. The loss of these forests -- which absorb and store vast amounts of climate-warming carbon dioxide, provide habitat for thousands of species, and help control erosion and flooding -- has become a cause of global environmental concern.

The declining role of large-scale agriculture in causing forest loss of late may stem from the success of conservation policies the Indonesian government has put into place since 2011 and by voluntary commitments to sustainability by corporations that own or manage oil palm or timber plantations, Austin said. It could also be driven by economic factors, such as falling commodity prices or increased international competition.","Fri, 01 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,"['policies', 'mining', 'wildfire', 'loss', 'oil', 'indonesia', 'forest', 'plantations', 'austin', 'practices', 'study', 'deforestation', 'primary', 'palm', 'threat', 'reflect', 'place', 'causes']", 
57,57,FL-2019-000011-IDN,The United States Saw 11 Natural Disaster Events That Exceeded $1 Billion in Damage During 2018 - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/blogs/corelogic/2019/02/06/516749.htm,"This post is part of a series sponsored by CoreLogic.

When it comes to natural disasters, 2018 was an eventful year worldwide. Typhoons devastated the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and Oman. Earthquakes caused mass casualties in Indonesia, business interruption in Japan and structure damage in Alaska. Volcanoes made the news in Hawaii, expanding the island’s terrain. Wildfires scorched the West Coast of the United States; Hurricanes Michael and Florence battered the Gulf and East Coasts.

1,000-year flood events (or floods that are said statistically to have a 1 in 1,000 chance of occurring) reoccurred after one-to-two years in Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin. Severe convective storms pelted Dallas, Texas and Colorado Springs, Colorado with large hail while a rash of tornado outbreaks, spawning 82 tornadoes in total, occurred from Western Louisiana and Arkansas all the way down to Southern Florida and up to Western Virginia.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)[1], there were 11 weather and climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion in the U.S. alone. Although last year’s count of billion-dollar events is a decrease from the previous year, both 2017 and 2018 have tracked far above the 1980-2017 annual average of $6 billion in total dollar amount in one year.

Annually, CoreLogic takes stock of the events that passed to help protect homeowners and businesses from the financial devastation that often follows catastrophe.

Highlights from the analysis this year include:

Over 1,600 significant flood events occurred in the U.S., 59 percent of which were flash flood-related.

Residential and commercial flood damage in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia from Hurricane Florence is estimated at $19 billion to $28.5 billion, of which roughly 85 percent was uninsured.

The 2018 Atlantic Hurricane season saw 15 named storms, eight of which were named hurricanes. Two of these, Hurricanes Florence (Category 1) and Michael (Category 4), made landfall along the U.S. This made 2018 the third back-to-back season of above-average hurricane activity in the Atlantic.

The number of acres that burned in 2018 is the eighth highest in U.S. history as reported through November 30, 2018.

A total of 11 western states had at least one wildfire that exceeded 50,000 burned acres; the leading states were California and Oregon, each with seven fires that burned more than 50,000 acres.

No one can stop a hurricane in its tracks or steady the ground from an earthquake, but with more information and an understanding of the risk, property owners and insurers can accelerate recovery and attain resiliency. This assessment covers an analysis of what the risk and exposure looked like, what happened during the event and the residential and commercial losses which occurred in the aftermath for each notable climatological event.

With more than 17,500 islands straddling two oceans, the sea is not only a way of life, but also a source of it.

Fisheries account for a significant part of Indonesia’s trillion-dollar economy – the largest in Southeast Asia. More than 30 percent of global maritime trade finds its way through the Strait of Malacca, which is among the busiest of international shipping lanes. Tourist havens are seemingly everywhere, from the palm-fringed beaches of Bali, to the abundant shallow-water reefs of the Coral Triangle.

Managing marine ecosystems is therefore an unsurprising priority for the vast number of actors that have a stake in Indonesia’s coastal economy. At once unexplored and overexploited, the oceans represent neoliberal development’s final frontier. The twin processes of ocean acidification and global warming, and related international political responses further complicate matters.

Blue economy

New analysis was recently published in the journal Science, indicating that oceans are heating up 40 percent faster than a United Nation panel of experts predicted in a study carried out five years ago.

The study further concluded that in 2018, seawater temperatures reached an all time high and were expected to escalate further in the coming years. Theses studies mirror those on land, where combined data from NASA and NOAA show that the five hottest years ever have occurred in the 2010s.

For many, marine ecosystem management, fisheries management, and climate change mitigation strategy are embodied in a redoubled commitment to the blue economy – the idea that the financialisation of oceans can reap economic profit and save the environment at once.

But what kind of development does the blue economy seek, and for whom? In Indonesia, small-scale fishers and their communities are holding fast to various manifestations of traditional knowledge that they see as key to ensuring the survival of the seas and of future generations.

Whose Oceans?

The Indonesian islands have long been at the forefront of oceanic policy and development circles, in large part because of their sheer numbers and strategic location.

One such high-level process held recently was the Our Ocean conference, which took place in late October in Bali. The meeting brought together a large number of powerful actors to debate some of the most pressing oceanic issues: climate change, fisheries, the blue economy, pollution, maritime security, and marine protected areas.

As is the case in many top decision-making spaces, representatives of governments, corporations, and intergovernmental institutions were given a seat at the table. Notably absent, however, were those closest to the sea – fishers.

Marthin Hadiwinata, Chief Executive of the Indonesia Traditional Fisherfolk’s Union (KNTI), said: “Policies on marine issues cannot be addressed in the absence of fishing communities who have direct linkages to the ocean”.

Hadiwinata explained that the issue of marine pollution, for instance, most deeply affects people living around the coastal areas and small islands: “Rather than inviting fishers to share their solutions,” he added, “companies who are involved in mining and other forms of extractive industry that dump their waste into the sea are regarded as corporate partners in cleaning up dirty waters”.

Blue carbon

Likewise, climate change mitigation and adaptation projects often turn to the problems that caused the environmental crisis in the first place as a way of responding to it. Take for example Blue Carbon, where, as with other carbon sequestration programs such as REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), polluters are allowed to continue their practices so long as they purchase ‘offsets’ in ecosystems elsewhere.

Most often, the burden falls on the shoulders of peasant and indigenous rural working communities, converting their crops and gathering spaces into monocultures such as industrial tree plantations.

Blue Carbon applies this logic to mangrove, coral, and seagrass ecosystems, while small-scale fishers who work in these areas are treated as nuisances and prohibited from future access to their fishing grounds.

Blue Carbon has been championed in high-level policy spaces such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) processes, as well as through ‘big green’ organisations like the Nature Conservancy. It is currently being pioneered in Indonesia.

People’s movements

Indonesian social movements and grassroots organisations have long been in the business of carefully protecting the islands’ cornucopia of natural resources. In the rapidly evolving marine sector, fishers are forced to be quick on their feet when putting their solutions on the national agenda.

KNTI, the small-scale fisher’s movement that is present in nearly all of Indonesia’s 34 provinces, is playing a leadership role in turning the tide of both discourse and policy towards justice and sovereignty for fishers. This task is done at scale, targeting national and transnational political dynamics.

When word of the Our Ocean conference and its lack of grassroots representation reached KNTI’s members, they were quick to clap back by organising their own participatory meeting: the Ocean’s People Conference. Unlike its ‘official’ counterpart, the parallel meeting reflected the diversity of Indonesia’s small-scale fisheries sector.

The gathering strategically took place in Jakarta – not just to make it more accessible, but also to shed light on marine mega-projects encroaching on the busy capital. The most notorious of these has been a land reclamation projectsupported by Indonesia’s former colonisers, the Dutch.

This project has been centred on protecting Jakarta from floods by installing a network of fake islands and a giant seawall in Jakarta Bay. While the Governor of Jakarta finally revoked some of the permits necessary to complete the project – thanks, in large part, to a strategic battle fought at the hands of social movements like KNTI – much of the damage has been done.

Local activists

Ipah Saripah, a fishworker from North Jakarta, explained that the reclamation issue has profoundly impacted her family’s livelihood: “Even though the reclamation stopped, they’ve already constructed four islands,” she said, “and that development is right in the middle of our fishing areas.

“We have been bribed, intimidated, displaced, and even tortured to make way for this reclamation,” she added.

Saripah and other activists from the fishing communities feel that big reclamation projects like the one stalled in Jakarta Bay serve as a blueprint for coastal development in Indonesia. Similar mega projects are being rolled out in other parts of the country, and they are woven together with the common thread of replacing traditional fishing practices with profit-seeking industries backed by big Asian and European capital.

That’s what the Ocean’s People Conference and related gatherings of people’s movements are attempting to shut down. Ibu Rofi’ah, a representative of a peasant organization in East Nusa Tengarra, Indonesia’s southernmost province, said: “We are not looking for money, but for means to spread our knowledge.”

Ibu Rofi’ah travelled to Jakarta to explain how she played a leadership role when her community put an end to an iron-mining operation. Today she is working with fisheries cooperatives that find themselves in standoffs with corporations in the mining and tourism sectors.

Movement building

Members of KNTI recognise that their struggles reflect those of fishing communities elsewhere. To this end, the movement is an active member of the World Forum of Fisher Peoples (WFFP), a transnational social justice movement dedicated to serving the unique needs of fishers and fishworkers.

Since the issues affecting fishers have become increasingly entangled – for instance, when climate change adaptation policies meet big capital – WFFP has doubled down on its attack strategies to protect the communities it represents.

A key part of that is actively promoting the Small Scale Fisheries Guidelines, which is the only comprehensive global governance instrument intended to protect fishers and traditional fisheries. KNTI has been doing this work across Indonesia, and making its demands global through social movement gatherings and even United Nations processes.

Marthin Hadiwinata said: “Here in Indonesia, we are pushing the government to immediately recognise and protect fishers’ rights. And at the same time, we are building the global movement to resist financialisation and privatisation of the world’s oceans.”

Eight people have been killed across the Pacific coast of South America after heavy rain caused flooding and landslides.

Three people died in Peru when mudslides hit two towns in the southern Arequipa region.

A rescue operation is currently under way to find survivors who may be buried in their vehicles.

Two workers were killed 50km away when another mudslide hit a mine in the Rio Grande Municipality.

Due to the intense rain, a state of emergency has been declared in several municipalities in the southern regions of Moquegua and Tacna.

In Chile, three people were killed in the northern provinces of El Loa and Antofagasta after several days of thunderstorms submerged roads, damaged homes and destroyed bridges.

Chilean state miner Codelco said on Friday that heavy rains forced the suspension of operations at its northern copper mines of Chuquicamata and Ministro Hales.

The rain also brought a waterfall back to life. The 60-metre waterfall in Pica had been dry for the past 10 years, but the recent severe weather revived it.

This is the rainy season in the region so some torrential downpour is expected. This year, however, the rains have been heavier than usual due to the warmth in the Pacific Ocean.

The warmth is almost pronounced enough to be classified as El Nino, which is a natural phenomenon known to affect the weather around the world.

Volcanology official Kasbani said on Friday that Mount Merapi on the main island of Java shot out hot clouds and lava that flowed 2 000m down its slopes late on Thursday.

Hours earlier, Mount Karangetang on Sulawesi's Siau island sent lava and searing gas out of its crater, prompting evacuation preparations.

Authorities expanded its danger zone to 4km from 3km from its crater.

No casualties or damage were reported and the volcanoes' alert levels were not raised.

Local authorities are trying to evacuate 508 villagers from the slope of the mountain, said Wensi Rumbayan, a senior member of the quick rescue team of the provincial disaster agency.

The sliding hot lava nearly reached a height of 300m in Batubulan village in Sitaro district, where the villagers could not leave the area via land transport, said Rumbayan.

""The hot lava and volcanic materials have slid down, burying roads. Bridges were also damaged and disappear from the surface because of the flows of the lava and materials,"" Rumbayan told Xinhua over the phone.

The village is located about 2,000m from the mountain and villagers live alongside a river where the upstream is in the slope of the volcano, making the village vulnerable when a stronger eruption or lava floods occur, he said.

The authorities planned to evacuate the villagers through sea with a ship, although some of them are reluctant to leave their houses and their cattle, Rumbayan said.

But weather has been unfavourable in recent days, with big waves hampering the ship to move close to a seaport, he said, adding that ""this also makes the distribution of aid difficult"".

To handle the risks of the eruption, local authorities declared a seven-day emergency beginning Feb 6.

Their family’s property Balootha on the Flinders River was carrying just under 4000 head, mainly weaners, which were being hand fed due to dry conditions when the record rain event began in late January.

“We’ve probably got less than five percent still here,” Jake told Beef Central this morning.

What started as desperately-needed drought-relieving rain simply didn’t stop, with 800mm (32 inches) recorded in the past 11 days – more than double their historical annual rainfall average.

The relentless rain and flood event has turned into a tragedy of unprecedented proportions in the north.

The 1974 floods had stood as the region’s biggest flood in living memory, but general consensus now is that this event is much bigger.

Jake said forecasts had pointed to good rain but no one suspected an 11-day deluge and metres of floodwater lay ahead.

This morning yielded the first glimpse of blue sky the Websters have seen above Balootha since January 29.

“It started raining but it just got worse and worse each day,” he said.

He said he had tried to feed the bit of hay he had left to weaners while it was raining, but it just got too cold.

“The exposure got to them, they just seemed to get disorientated after a few days,” he said.

“There would be hay out for them but they would just be all standing together and they didn’t go out and eat it or anything.”

Where possible he has been pushing mobs of dead cattle together with a tractor to either bury them or burn them before they start to smell.

Asked whether he felt estimates that cattle losses across the region could be in the ‘hundreds of thousands’ range, as has been reported, he said he believed that number was likely to be accurate.

“Easy. Everyone I have talked to, all their records say this is worse than 74, that is all I have ever heard people talk about being the worst flood.

68,68,FL-2019-000011-IDN,Cattle losses mount as Northwest QLD faces monumental flood event - Beef Central,https://www.beefcentral.com/news/cattle-losses-mount-as-northwest-qld-faces-monumental-flood-event/,"A NATURAL disaster of monumental proportions is unfolding in northwest and central western Queensland, with fears of substantial losses among drought-weakened cattle after ten days of relentless, torrential rain.

A region from west of Hughenden all the way to Cloncurry and north into the gulf region has received unprecedented falls of 400-600mm or more over the past ten days, turning large parts of the essentially flat region into an inland sea (see today’s weekly rainfall summary).

It will be weeks before vehicles can get across the country, but aerial inspections are painting a grim picture about the conditions, suggesting stock losses in some areas will be severe.

Pockets of already drought-weakened stock are gathered on high-points like turkey’s nests all over the region – many of which have not had access to feed for days.

Beef Central spoke to a range of cattle producers across the region from Richmond to the Northern Territory border this morning, who said it would be weeks before a true assessment of the extent of damage could be made. Opinions about the likely extent of stock losses varied, but most agreed that there will be some substantial losses among already weakened stock succumbing to exposure, bogging, prolonged lack of feed and simply being swept away in floodwaters.

Early estimates suggest stock losses across the affected region could reach 300,000 to 500,000 head.

AgForce chief executive Mike Guerin said although it was too early for a precise estimate of the financial cost from livestock losses and damage to property and equipment, it was likely to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Fodder drops planned by defence

The Federal Government has responded swiftly this morning, confirming that defence aircraft will deployed to drop fodder for cattle cut-off by flooding in northern parts of the state

“While the logistics are still to be worked out, the Australian defence force will use its aircraft to help our farmers,” agriculture minister David Littleproud said.

“Thousands of cattle are cut off by floodwaters and we had to act decisively to stop them from starving,” he said.

Federal Member for Kennedy, Bob Katter, whose sprawling electorate is heavily impacted by the flooding, said North Queensland’s mid-west – an area of a million square kilometres – was an emerging catastrophe.

“The situation has dramatically worsened over the last few days,” Mr Katter said. “Cattle cannot move around on the heavy black soil, they cannot forage for food, they are in a very poor and weakened position, after what had been a very long dry,” he said.

“Cattlemen in the mid-west are telling me conditions are very similar now to those seen during Cyclone Ted in 1976.”

Mr Katter’s son, state member for the Mt Isa-based seat of Traeger, Robbie Katter, said northwestern Queensland graziers were losing stock by the hundreds due to torrential rain and flooding.

He said producers were forced to sit idle as excessive and unrelenting rainfall, flooding, cold winds and a lack of grass was leading to catastrophic stock losses.

“It has very quickly turned into a dire situation now where towns and properties are cut off and it’s very hard, if not impossible, to get fodder in,” he said. “Many producers who do have fodder are stranded into their homesteads and unable to get out to locate and feed stock.”

“We are now demanding from the State and Federal Governments that an emergency coordination response takes place straight away to help these people who are in desperate need.”

AgForce establishes crisis team

Queensland’s state farm organisation AgForce has established a crisis management team to help affected producers receive the support they need to come through the episode.

An immediate need for many is for fodder to be airlifted to isolated cattle, many of which are weakened by years of drought. Producers who need fodder are encouraged to contact AgForce or their Local Disaster Management Group, via their local Council.

AgForce CEO Michael Guerin said past experience of such events indicated that stock losses on the worst-affected properties are likely to be ‘significant.’

“Stock losses will be much higher than normal, because drought-weakened cattle are more susceptible to being caught and drowned in floodwaters or dying of exposure in the wet, cold winds,” he said.

“This is absolutely heart-breaking for producers who have expended enormous amounts of money and energy keeping their herds alive through the drought, only to see them now devastated by floods. Our crisis management team will meet daily to move issues up to the highest levels of Government to ensure situations are quickly recognised, responded to, and no areas are left overlooked,” he said.

Cloncurry area inundated

Former Cattle Council of Australia vice president Peter Hall, who has country around the Cloncurry and Julia Creek region, said given the conditions, it was still too early to assess the extent of stock losses or damage to infrastructure in his region.

“As a general rule, properties around here have had an incredible 500-600mm of rain in the past seven or eight days, and similar around Julia Creek and further south towards Kynuna,” he said.

“The situation is such that there will inevitably be some stock losses – but it’s very hard to tell while country is still impassable, and probably not wise to speculate.”

Richmond stock agent Ashley Naclerio, from Stockplace Marketing, painted a picture of devastation in his area, saying many local cattle producers were yet to start to assess damage and stock losses.

“Average falls here have been around 500mm, but some places have had a lot more,” he said.

“We’ve heard reliable reports of 500 head lost on one place alone, but that was only country they could see from the house. It’s going to be pretty devastating for a lot of people, but it will be weeks before an accurate picture of losses emerges.”

Mr Naclerio said six helicopters were currently operating ‘flat-out’ out of Richmond, doing emergency runs, fodder drops to isolated cattle, and shooting bogged cattle. In some cases, stranded cattle that had already been fed from the air became bogged around the dropped hay, and perished.

“Everyone is trying to get out and do the best they can, but it will be two or three weeks, at least, before anybody can get out onto paddocks themselves. Fencing will be basically non-existent anywhere along the Flinders River,” he said.

“We did an inspection from the air along the Flinders River at Richmond this morning, and there was no ground in sight to either horizon. I’d guess the river could be 15-20km wide at present.”

While areas further east around Hughenden are nowhere near as badly affected, having received around 200mm of rain, some much bigger falls were recorded north of Hughenden in the basalt country.

While the weather would create devastation short-term, good growth should follow in buffel, Flinders and Mitchell grasses, and winter herbage heading into winter.

Fodder drops only hope

Richmond beef producer Betty Witherspoon, whose property Maroola Station is 120km from town, said she was among the many in a hopeless situation.

“We have had 660mm (26 inches) of rain here in a week. I have been here for 32 years and that is just unheard off,” she said.

“We have about 500 head probably up on high ridges trying to stay dry, but there will be absolutely no fodder for them. The sun hasn’t come out so the grass can’t grow – it just won’t stop raining.”

Mrs Witherspoon said she and her family had tried desperately to get to their cattle to feed hay but relentless rain and waterlogged paddocks meant they were bogged almost as soon as they left the homestead.

“It’s going to be weeks before we can drive to them – the only way they will survive is if hay is flown in and dropped to them now.”

Further south at NAPCo’s Kynuna station, more than 600mm has been received since late January, but conditions have not allowed any assessment of stock or fencing losses to this point, Beef Central was told.

In the Gulf region, AA Co’s Canobie and Wandoola stations are experiencing a significant rain event, and there is a major flood warning for the Flinders and Cloncurry Rivers.

The company denied early anecdotal reports that stock losses on both properties had been substantial.

“It is far too early to assess what the impact on livestock will be. We will likely only know more once flood waters have started to properly recede,” a company spokesman said.

“Our focus – like all producers in the area – is on animal welfare as our number one priority. The operations team had planned ahead of the rain event, and have had a strategy in place which has allowed forward-planning of helicopters, fuel and feed. The size of the rainfall and volume of water has added some complexity to the way we respond,” the company said.

“We have senior management on the ground coordinating our response, and will be providing every support possible for our people on the impacted stations as they work to manage the situation over the coming days and weeks.”","Tue, 05 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.beefcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20180206-Ben-and-Cheri-Stanger-Cowan-Downs-2-300x400.jpeg,"['weeks', 'stock', 'losses', 'monumental', 'days', 'cattle', 'region', 'fodder', 'mount', 'event', 'faces', 'northwest', 'feed', 'qld', 'flood', 'rain', 'producers']",

El Niño is the largest climate phenomenon that occurs frequently, producing droughts, floods, wildfires, dust and snow storms, fish kill, and even elevated risks of civil conflicts. The theatre of action for El Niño is the tropical Pacific Ocean but its global reach costs the global community tens of billions of dollars each time.

El Niños occur every two-to-seven years, with very strong El Niño’s occurring about every 15 years. How the frequency, time and strength between two events will change because of global warming remains a grand challenge for climate models. This also impacts projections of future climate since El Niños redistribute the heat gathered by the ocean between two El Niño events to cause a mini global warming. The most recent projection of global warming impact on El Niño appeared in the scientific journal Nature in December 2018.

El Niño is measured by an index that averages sea surface temperature anomalies over the central-eastern tropical Pacific. Each model delivers a slightly different rendition of El Niño compared to nature. This has been an issue in finding a consensus among models as far as the El Niño response to global warming is concerned. But by using a model-specific El Niño index to make room for the inter-model differences, the latest projection posits that strong El Niños and extreme weather events associated with them will increase in the coming decades.

The results should serve as a warning to countries on all continents that suffer from these extreme weather events during strong El Niño events such as the ones during 1982-83, 1997-98 and 2015-16. However, some major caveats are in order.

The first caveat is that the eagerly-awaited winter rain and snow storms over California did not occur over California during the latest extreme El Niño. It is thus unclear if global warming is already affecting El Niño and its remote impacts. Secondly, the models used for making future projections have not stood the test of time for their depiction of El Niño during the 20th century.

The mean state of the tropical Pacific has cold temperatures in the east around the Galápagos Islands because the trade winds blowing from the east to west diverge waters away from the equator and push them westward. The atmosphere warms westward, moving waters and piling it in the west. Warm waters favour atmospheric convection and produce over 5 metres of rain per year to the west of the International Date Line to New Guinea. El Niño is a perturbation of this background state of cold east–warm west ocean, with air rising in the west and sinking in the east.

During an El Niño, warm waters and rainfall move east towards the Galapagos and bring copious amounts of rain and mudslides to the Americas while causing droughts in the west, over Australia and Indonesia. Floods, droughts and other extremes also occur over many other regions of the globe.

The response of El Niño to global warming depends on how this background state responds to global warming as well. Some models warm the eastern tropical Pacific more than the west while others produce a faster warming in the west. Whether the east warms faster or the west has serious consequences for global warming itself since the cold eastern Pacific soaks up a lot of heating from the atmosphere. A slower warming of the east would imply more heat uptake by the ocean and a slower global warming.

Unfortunately, available data is not sufficient to say with confidence how the tropical Pacific has responded to global warming till now. All available evidence for El Niño behaviour during the Holocene or the Last Glacial Maximum indicates that El Niño is highly variable and its variability depends on weather noise over the western Pacific, volcanoes, impact of phytoplankton on penetration of solar radiation into the ocean, aerosols and so on. It is unclear if the impact of global warming on El Niño can easily be extracted considering its intrinsic tendencies and the fact that it depends on so many factors that are not easily predictable.

In this context, it is imperative that models be held to very stringent standards on their performance of El Niño behaviour during historic periods, especially the 20th century, as a test of their reliability for future projections. This would also be necessary for projecting other events such as droughts and floods. For example, droughts over India are closely tied with El Niño and any projections of how droughts will respond to global warming will depend on how models perform in their historic depiction of El Niños as well as monsoons and how reliably they can project El Niño response to global warming in addition to how the models perform in reproducing floods and droughts of 20th century.

Shortly after Hurricane Sandy struck the East Coast of the United States in 2012, the U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) visited the Netherlands. Shaun Donovan had been asked to lead President Barack Obama’s Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, aimed at the reconstruction of areas devastated not just by that hurricane, but by other natural disasters since 2011. The budget of the task force was nearly US$60 billion, and its mission was far-reaching. It would address housing, healthcare, the social and local economic impact of disaster, the overhaul of infrastructure, and preparation for other potential water-related threats in light of climate change. The storm had affected 24 states, from Florida to Maine and as far west as Wisconsin, with the most severe damage in New Jersey and New York. Sea levels were almost certain to rise again, and lowland flooding to recur, and the U.S. lacked the expertise to manage them.

Donovan’s host was Henk Ovink, deputy director general of Spatial Planning and Water Affairs at the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment in the Hague. It was his job to show Donovan how innovative practices in the Netherlands — including water technology, finance, and public–private collaboration — had continued to hold back the floods there, and how they could do the same elsewhere.

In 2013, Donovan invited Ovink to join the task force. Ovink moved to the U.S. for several years, and as part of his efforts, cofounded (with the Rockefeller Foundation and New York University) a New York–based program called Rebuild by Design. Rebuild by Design focuses on large-scale community-led planning and disaster preparation projects for waterfront cities around the world.

“Communities can’t afford to wait until after the next hurricane or flood…to plan for the future,” according to the Rebuild by Design website. It’s a sentiment that has informed the Dutch, who not only have managed their own immense water-related challenges, but have created a role for themselves in helping others. The country has gradually built up unparalleled expertise in flood control and water management, and is now turning that expertise into an export industry. Ovink, for example, spends much of his time traveling the world to promote innovative approaches to solving water problems, often involving collaborative engagements with Dutch advisors and companies.

“When something goes wrong, you must look beyond the horizon,” says Ovink, who has since been appointed special envoy for international water affairs (also known as “water ambassador”) for the Netherlands. “You want to make sure that what you do next is also an investment in the future. You need to look at the entire system you are dealing with to get a good understanding of how all processes are interlinked: sewerage, spatial planning of a city, the functions of green areas, infrastructure, rivers.”

The Netherlands has gradually built up unparalleled expertise in flood control and water management, and is now turning that expertise into an export industry.

According to the government’s Dutch Water Technology website, the Netherlands has 125 advanced engineering and architecture businesses with global clientele, providing such services as flood control, wastewater management, desalination, flood insurance, infrastructure design, algae management, and other forms of advanced water treatment. Together with Dutch government agencies and research groups, these businesses are changing the way others think about preparing for flooding and related disasters, shifting the process from a purely technological endeavor to one that involves community building and environmentally oriented practice. And they’re setting an example for a benign neo-mercantile business model that other countries with challenges can follow, by selling the solutions they have developed over time.

Water Ways

To understand why the Netherlands has become the world’s go-to source of water management expertise, one needs only to fly over this densely populated country, with more than 17 million inhabitants, and count the number of villages and cities that are surrounded by rivers, lakes, and ocean or sea inlets. Indeed, about 26 percent of the Netherlands terrain lies below sea level (pdf), with 60 percent of the population living in those areas; about 59 percent of the country’s land is vulnerable to river flooding.

Because of this geography, water management has always been a critical policy field of this Northern European nation. For the Dutch, it comes naturally to spend money on the vast water system: On average the government sets aside more than €4 billion (more than US$5 billion) each year to keep up its defenses against high water. According to the Netherlands Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management, an estimated 1,900 kilometers of dikes and levees are expected to be in place by 2050.

“Water management is deeply ingrained in the DNA of the Netherlands,” says Ovink. As early as the 12th century, the Dutch had established water boards (waterschappen), regional government bodies charged with managing water barriers, waterways, water levels, water quality, and sewage treatment. These boards are among the oldest forms of local government in the Netherlands.

The political groundwork paved the way for the Dutch water sector to thrive, by encouraging innovative solutions and helping bring them to scale. The most famous example is the Delta Works, a series of construction projects in the southwest area of the Netherlands, which protect a vast area of land around the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta from the sea. The project was launched in 1953, just after a North Sea flood, the worst in more than a century, suddenly inundated more than 165,000 hectares (about 408,000 acres) in the Netherlands and took more than 1,800 lives.

The Delta Works consists of dams, dikes, locks, levees, and storm surge barriers. It was conceived from the beginning as a long-term project and was designed to push back seawater, reduce the complexity and length of the existing dikes, promote the natural environment where possible, and maintain local communities. Its first project, a storm barrier in the river Hollandse IJssel, opened in 1958, but the Delta Works weren’t completed until 1997 and are still continually upgraded. Among the Delta Works’ components is the world’s largest robot, the Maeslant storm surge barrier — two gates, 22 meters (72 feet) high, guarding the mouth of the Rhine and Meuse rivers. They can open and close automatically based on algorithmic calculations of the threat of storm surges. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, the entire Delta Works is one of Seven Wonders of the Modern World, alongside the Panama Canal, the Channel Tunnel, and the Golden Gate Bridge.

Over the years, dozens of local engineering, construction, software development, and technological consulting firms, along with community and regional groups, have been involved in the Delta Works, coordinated by a national commission. “The cooperation between these different actors and tight communication between them is what characterizes the Dutch approach, and what sets it apart from any other place in the world,” says Ovink. The Delta Works is known for its emphasis on learning from experience, and for its leaders’ willingness to alter plans as they gain sophistication. For example, a closed dam design for the Schelde River, completely separating seawater from freshwater, was switched in 1976 to an open design, preserving the mixed brine environment so local fish could thrive. More recently, on what the WWF called the “historic day” of November 15, 2018, the Dutch government opened the Haringvliet dam, connecting the Rhine and Meuse rivers to the North Sea and allowing migratory fish to swim to their delta spawning grounds for the first time in 47 years. According to Ovink, “It was done in close collaboration with local farmers and citizens. Working in and on this Dutch delta never stops.”

Dutch water engineering expertise wasn’t limited to the delta. Another example is the 300-meter-long (328-yard-long) self-raising Spakenburg dike, which is typically hidden away in the sidewalk to keep the view picturesque for tourists, but which can be lifted to 80 centimeters (31 inches) by the same floodwaters it is designed to keep out. Then there’s the Eendragtspolder, a land area near Rotterdam reclaimed from the sea. It’s a patchwork of fields and streams, designed as a rowing course, and used as the site of the 2016 World Rowing Championships. There are also larger-scale reclamation programs aimed at flood reduction. Ruimte voor de Rivier (“Room for the River”) adds capacity to major flowing streams through sediment removal, dike relocation, and landscape redesign. The Coastal Weak Link program identifies vulnerable communities and builds sand dunes and beaches as tidal defenses.

Taking It Overseas

As projects like these evolved, the Dutch water technology export business naturally evolved with them. Projects like Spakenburg and Eendragtspolder are seen as models for projects in England, China, the U.S., and elsewhere. It is estimated that the annual export of Dutch water technology and knowledge has doubled since 2000, to just under €8 billion ($9.3 billion) in 2016. Interest has accelerated with the growing consciousness of climate change and its effects.

“We gain our experience in the Netherlands,” says Herman Mondeel, head of the product market business unit water management team at Witteveen+Bos, a global 1,100-employee engineering consultancy headquartered in the Dutch city of Deventer. Among its areas of expertise are (salt) groundwater control, storing freshwater in soil, spatial and climate adaptation, and urban flood management; 30 to 40 percent of its business comes from foreign clients. Sometimes with World Bank or Asian Development Bank funding, the firm is active in Dubai, Ghana, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Singapore, and Vietnam.

Mondeel says that his firm’s business is based in part on the Netherlands’ reputation in general, not just for expertise but for its integrated approach to building solutions. “We help with process management, participative design, and quality of construction,” he says. “How do you deal with the government, but also with people who live and work in the affected areas? How do you go beyond writing up the reports, to make sure something is built?”

Designing measures that fit well in the context is an important issue. “Often we come across problems that are the result of a lack of attention,” adds Mondeel. “In Jakarta, they built a concrete two-meter-high wall to hold back the sea. But the subsidence is 10 to 15 centimeters per year, and the wall could overtop or break any moment without proper maintenance.” For the 3 million people who would be flooded if that happened, “the wall is merely bringing a false sense of security.” Dikes and dams are more appropriate for places where there is sufficient attention for maintenance.

Witteveen+Bos, starting with its understanding of public–private collaboration grounded in centuries of Dutch experience with local governance, helped the Indonesians develop a polder (a tract of reclaimed low land) that protects 100,000 people in Semarang, with its own water governance board system. “We bring an understanding that collaborations are of vital importance, to ensure that different levels of governments work well together. In a hierarchical system like Indonesia’s, that can be very difficult at first,” says Mondeel.

Another Dutch engineering consultancy, Royal HaskoningDHV, took its expertise in water management to the United States. In partnership with the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), a firm cofounded by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, it was selected by Rebuild by Design to help the New Jersey city of Hoboken recover from Hurricane Sandy. Located directly across the Hudson River from Manhattan, Hoboken is the fourth-densest city in the U.S., and a commuter hub for more than 50,000 people. Its housing and transit infrastructure had been badly damaged by the storm.

The resulting urban water strategy for Hoboken and surrounding areas is a comprehensive approach to managing stormwater and tidal surge, based on Dutch experience and extensive collaboration with New Jersey community leaders. The strategy has four objectives: resisting coastal storm damage, delaying flooding from rainwater runoff, storing excess water in “green infrastructure” such as rain gardens and permeable paving, and discharging drainage in a more controlled way. New elements include “hard” flood prevention structures, such as bulkheads and seawalls; “soft” landscape-based defenses such as permeable paving and rain gardens; improvements to wastewater and drinking water infrastructure; and urban planning efforts to mix, for example, living space with greenery.

“The Netherlands is a true laboratory for innovation,” says Lisette Heuer, global director of flood resilience for Royal HaskoningDHV. “We try out ideas, and if they work here, we can explore applying similar solutions in other countries provided a fit with local context.” At the same time, she says, the close connection with local stakeholders is critical. “The Hoboken project became a team effort, where the borders of a particular company were no longer relevant. We created workshops, for example, with stakeholders from all parts of the community, all at the table working out potential solutions. That can’t be achieved by only one company or agency, but it also requires a team from multiple places who can act as if they belong to one company.”

Local engagement was also important, Heuer adds, because the consulting firms eventually leave. “These big infrastructural projects are often highly complex. How do you make sure they are properly maintained? You need to see it take root in the local environment,” she says.

The Rebuild by Design work is still underway. Indeed, the Hoboken project was one of seven winners of a 2013 competition conducted by Donovan’s Hurricane Sandy task force, which invited designers to develop innovative design solutions for resilient rebuilding. There were 148 entrants from around the world; Dutch expertise was active in five of the seven selected. A key part of each winning project was local community engagement, a priority that came naturally to the Dutch, with their local water management heritage. “This goes beyond getting local stakeholders to support something you have already created in your ivory tower,” says Ovink. “That is how projects grow sour, a mistake that happens all over the world.” Instead, he says, the Dutch start with true cooperation, with local communities designing solutions together with the professionals. “The knowledge of local communities is just as valuable as the knowledge of an expert. Rebuild by Design was unique, because it forced the federal government to sit down with communities, businesses, NGOs, local and state governments, research institutes, and schools,” he says. “You need them all.”

Following the Dutch Example

Throughout the world, other countries have also learned lessons through adversity. They might be dealing with aging populations, as they are in Japan; resource management, as they are in Canada; cyberattack, as in Estonia; water scarcity, as in much of the Middle East; or natural disasters, such as forest fires, earthquakes, or tsunamis. As extreme weather increases in frequency and urgency, threats are likely to proliferate, and thus so are opportunities. Manufacturers, for example, are already aware of the climate-related risks to supply chains — when a hurricane hits a manufacturing region where one component of an electronic device is made, all production of that device may cease.

The Dutch are well positioned to benefit economically from adversity. As Heuer points out, in the 2018 World Economic Forum Global Risks Report (pdf), four out of the five threats rated high in both likelihood and impact had a direct link to water. (These were extreme weather events, natural disasters, failure to adapt to climate change, water crises, and cyberattack.) As business and government leaders become aware of the dangers of ignoring these risks, they become much more sensitive to the value of proactive, preventive solutions to their potential water problems.

“Throughout the business world,” Heuer says, “interest is growing. For example, many companies are asked to visualize their water risks in an end-of-year report and to include them in their financial balance.” The same concerns are evident in the way insurance companies evaluate the risks in their portfolios. Concerns are growing rapidly enough that Ovink estimates the Dutch water solutions business sector could multiply fourfold in just a few years — if it had the requisite capacity. In the process, it would evolve to coordinate other challenges: food, energy, waste, health, and ecological improvement initiatives all involve water management. (One country generating similar business opportunities is Singapore, which is exporting its expertise in managing freshwater scarcity.)

Imagine that you were in a country with a similar body of knowledge. How could you build an exportable business? There is a great deal to learn from the Dutch example.

• “Cultivate innovation and experimentation over time,” says Heuer. The Dutch took the long view from the beginning, recognizing that it would take years, and much participative collaboration, to develop the necessary knowledge.

• Monitor the needs of other locales. “You need to travel and see what governments want,” says Mondeel. This includes assessing the readiness of the general market. “If a certain problem is suddenly prominent, so that business and government leaders are talking about it, you should probably enter. But if other players are already dominant, you need to stay away.”

• Link your efforts to those of other companies and to your home country’s organizations. Both Royal HaskoningDHV and Witteveen+Bos, for instance, work closely with the Netherlands Water Partnership (NWP), a network of organizations that aim to address global water issues and promote Dutch expertise in this field. “NWP has established links between businesses in the Netherlands and abroad,” says Mondeel. Active in 40 countries, it has 181 members, including businesses, government agencies, universities, think tanks, and nongovernmental organizations.

• Promote transformative solutions with multiple participants. Ovink argues that specific measures — a single technology or plant — should be seen as starting points for more significant movements. The broader your effort, the more other actors will be motivated to contribute, and add to one another’s knowledge.

• Design for sustainability. It’s not enough to build a new barrier or power plant. You have to ensure it will last over time, and continue to prevent catastrophe. This means setting up structures, such as the Dutch water boards, that force someone to pay continual attention to maintenance and improvement.

• Remain humble. Ovink is always careful to avoid lecturing people about the brilliance of the Dutch way. “There is no plane [full of] Dutch solutions, occasionally air-dropping them and expecting them to work. Those projects could easily turn out to be dysfunctional and then local people will say, ‘What did those Dutch people give us?’ Instead, you have to set up collaboration with local experts, stakeholders, and governments, where everyone can work together to develop the best answers, [which is] of course inspired by Dutch capacity and innovation,” he says. The long-ingrained Dutch predisposition to collaboration, says Ovink, naturally tends to generate “local and contextualized solutions developed with our expertise and experience. That collaborative approach strengthens the value of the solutions we provide, and their resilience and sustainability.”

The increasing complexity of global issues makes it more likely that large-scale problem solving will be an aspect of economic growth for countries around the world. As Lisette Heuer points out, work on water management is now moving from protection (dams and levees) to risk reduction (redesigning waterways) to adaptation and resilience. This is a consequence of the exponentially increasing impact of the problems associated with climate change in particular.

“In that sense, we are at a crossroads,” says Heuer. “When we expected a single 50-centimeter sea level rise, we took measures that would be effective for 65 years. But if we want to manage for another 50-centimeter rise, those measures will be effective only for 25 years. And the measures after that will be effective only for 10 years. So we will need new types of measures.” This means a more challenging playing field, Heuer acknowledges. “But we feel right at home with that complexity. That is how we add value to a project.”

Flash forward 10 or 20 years, and the range of problems could look much more challenging than it does today. Almost certainly, the solutions will require technological advances, human ingenuity, and a great deal of imagination — along with the ability to track results. For companies and governments alike, this means starting now to look far ahead, and to think about not only how to respond to disaster, but how to build the sustainable enterprises that make resilience work by making it a sustainable source of profits.","Mon, 28 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.strategy-business.com/media/image/41468350_thumb5_690x400.jpg,"['ovink', 'expertise', 'water', 'design', 'local', 'solutions', 'world', 'experts', 'management', 'dutch', 'netherlands']", 
73,73,FL-2019-000011-IDN,Protecting our food by protecting our farmers - The ASEAN Post,https://theaseanpost.com/article/protecting-our-food-protecting-our-farmers,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected that global warming is likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2030. This is projected to bring about changes in the climate and natural systems, including changes in the frequency and intensity of weather events, sea-level rise, habitat and range loss, biodiversity loss, water scarcity and more.

Every aspect of human life including health, livelihoods, food, security and economic growth is expected to be impacted. This is especially true in Southeast Asia, where climate change is threatening to disrupt the remarkable expansion of its economies and undo the hard-earned achievements of its sustainable development.

The Southeast Asian region has been ranked as one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change due to the urbanisation and concentration of its economic capitals along coastline areas and within deltas, as well as its economic reliance on agriculture and natural resources. According to the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), worsening climate conditions in the region is a key driver for the increase in the number of people suffering from starvation.

Agriculture at the front line

In 2018, extreme seasonal rains and flooding in the north, an extended dry season in Indonesia, and increasingly frequent storm events from tropical depressions to super typhoons, took a toll on the region’s economy. Climate events such as these resulted in the destruction of paddy fields and farms in the region’s crucial agricultural heartlands.

According to Carolyn Rodrigues Birkett, Director of FAO’s Liaison Office in Geneva, in developing countries, the agriculture sector absorbs about 22 percent of the total damage and losses caused by natural hazards, 84 percent if one considers drought alone.

“No sector is more sensitive than agriculture and no solution to climate change and disasters will be complete without agricultural inputs,” she said at the opening of a panel discussion on Integrating Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction.

Farmers are at the front line of climate change, staring down droughts, extreme rainfall, flooding and storms to continue producing food for everyone. But what happens if farmers cannot absorb the damages and are forced to discontinue food production? In Indonesia, for example, around 93 percent of Indonesia’s farmers are small family farmers for food crops such as rice, corn and cassava, as well as cash crops like palm oil and rubber. Many of them struggle with poverty, with almost one fifth of them living below the national poverty line.

Mitigating climate damage to key food crops

Towards building farmers’ resilience, the region’s governments have started moving toward setting up risk transfer mechanisms, such as insurance for the agricultural sector at different levels. In the region, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Cambodia and Myanmar have tested and developed specific models of government-subsidised insurance-based schemes to protect against the worst damage due to extreme weather events, all at different levels of implementation.

In Indonesia, after a few pilot projects, the government there launched the National Agricultural Scheme for rice farmers in 2015. However, despite the strong participation of the public sector where 80 percent of premiums were subsidised locally, the penetration of such financial instruments is still low while coverage for crops other than rice is limited.

Agricultural Insurance Specialist, Margherita Bavagnoli said that the main challenges are not only to increase the uptake from farmers, but also to develop a strategy for long-term sustainability of those instruments.

“Obviously, financial burden is one of the reasons for low penetration. However, many other variables are seen as playing almost equal importance in the success or failure of such products. As long as farmers do not fully understand the importance of such products, and the private sector does not play an active role in creating a market, such measures will only remain a social protection measure provided by governments. This is hardly sustainable in the long run,” explained Bavagnoli.

The IPCC has warned that rice yields and quality will likely face reduction. This is true for most other staple foods such as maize, wheat and other cereal crops. Governments, the private sector and other stakeholders need to help farmers continue to produce and be profitable as the climate worsens, without whom, there will be no food on our tables.

The two events together killed more than 2,200 people in the region.

Although Indonesia is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, the Palu tsunami came as a surprise to geophysicists. A tsunami occurs when a quake on the seabed abruptly pushes water upward, producing a dangerously tall wave. Usually the culprit is a megathrust earthquake, as one tectonic plate slides, or subducts, beneath another. The tsunami that hit Sumatra in 2004, causing 230,000 deaths, was generated by a megathrust quake.

In contrast, the tsunami in September was caused by what is known as a strike-slip quake. These occur at seismic faults where two tectonic plates are sliding past each other. The ground motion in such quakes is mostly horizontal — in Sulawesi, the rocks on either side of the fault lurched past each other by more than 10 feet — and rarely produce tsunamis. But the Palu earthquake caused an underwater landslide, which produced a small tsunami that grew as it swept up a narrowing bay.

And, it turns out, something even more unusual was at work, according to two papers published in the journal Nature Geoscience on Monday. As the fault ruptured, the leading edge of the rupture tore through the crust much faster than usual, perhaps magnifying the shaking that led to the underwater landslide. Such behavior has been predicted in theory, but had not been conclusively documented in nature.","Tue, 05 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/06/science/06EARTHQUAKE1/06EARTHQUAKE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=4b84803fcdeda11cde950b79d624f3a26987f8379b835b2777e45064b0890e24&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"['2018', 'palu', 'tectonic', 'deadliest', 'quake', 'nature', 'megathrust', 'earthquake', 'sulawesi', 'past', 'tsunami', 'underwater', 'fastest']", 
79,79,FL-2019-000011-IDN,PepsiCo responds with 'disappointment' at Indofood's withdrawal from RSPO over disputed audit decision - FoodNavigator-Asia.com,https://www.foodnavigator-asia.com/Article/2019/01/30/PepsiCo-responds-with-disappointment-at-Indofood-s-withdrawal-from-RSPO-over-disputed-audit-decision,"After conducting an ‘independent verification visit’​ in June 2018 to PT Perusahaan Perkebunan London Sumatra Indonesia Tbk (Lonsum), owned by Indofood plantation arm Indo Agri, the RSPO complaints panel issued a final decision letter to the company on November 2 2018.

In the letter, the panel detailed a list of Lonsum’s supposed breaches of the RSPO Principles and Criteria (P&C), as well as ordered it to take a series of corrective actions.

In total, the letter listed some 23 alleged offences, ranging from workers’ working conditions and health risks to gender discrimination and child labour.

Lonsum was directed to provide an updated Action Plan ‘with clear milestones and a timeline for implementation’​ including the corrective actions within 30 days of the decision letter issuance, but apparently failed to do so, resulting in another warning letter being issued to them on January 15 2019.

The company responded after this by deciding to withdraw entirely from the RSPO claiming ‘unexplained inconsistencies’ ​and an ‘unrealistic timeline’​.

‘We are extremely disappointed with the process and decision of the [RSPO] Complaints Panel,”​ said Lonsum Group Head of Sustainability Muhammad Waras via an official withdrawal letter.

“We are not in agreement with [some of the audit findings], and [based on the 23 audits conducted since 2016], there were no material findings to substantiate the allegations and we have implemented all Non-Conformities arising from the above audits.​

“There remains a material and unexplained inconsistency in findings between the [June 2018] verification audit and the previous 23 audits.”​

“[In our letter to the RSPO Secretariat on December 10 2018], we gave you notice that we were looking for outside consultants to engage and help us in this process [and requested advice on a suitable consultant.​

Waras went on to say that after that, the company staff had gone on leave for the December year-end holidays which ‘naturally limited​’ the company’s progress on the matter.

“[We then received your January 15 letter, directing us to] submit our Action Plan within three working days, which is impossible for us to comply with. We feel it is unrealistic for you to impose this very short deadline on us.”​

Waras concluded by saying that the company would focus its sustainability efforts on the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) moving forward instead, and announced its official withdrawal from the RSPO.

The ISPO has also previously been criticised by local organisations as being inadequate, and just a ‘mere instrument for Indonesian palm oil to be recognised in international markets’​.

Food brands cut ties ​

The initial NGO coalition to submit the complaint against Indofood comprised of the Rainforest Action Network (RAN), the International Labor Rights Forum (ILRF) and Indonesian labor rights organization OPPUK.

According to their press release on the matter, a number of well-known food brands have claimed to have cut ties with Indofood prior to this, including Nestle, Cargill, Hershey’s, Kellogg’s, Unilever, and Mars.

“However, many companies still do business with Indofood and remain connected to its labor abuses, including joint venture partners PepsiCo, Wilmar and Yum! Brands,”​ said the NGOs.

Robin Averbeck, Agribusiness Campaign Director at RAN, added that: “PepsiCo and Wilmar have stopped sourcing IndoAgri’s palm oil, it’s past time they terminate their joint venture partnerships with this company.”​

“Otherwise, they knowingly continue to do business with a company engaging in illegal and unethical behavior without compunction.”​

The NGOs also claimed the move from Indofood to be ‘an attempt to evade its responsibilities to respect the rights of its workers’.​

In response to Lonsum's withdrawal from the RSPO, PepsiCo told FoodNavigator-Asia​ that it was also 'very disappointed'​ in the decision.

“PepsiCo and our Indonesian joint venture decided some time ago to no longer receive palm oil from IndoAgri, owner of PT Lonsum,""​ a PepsiCo spokesman told us.

""We are very disappointed to learn of IndoAgri’s attempt to withdraw PT Lonsum from the RSPO. This is unacceptable and inconsistent with our policy and commitments on sustainable palm oil.""​

""We support the RSPO’s Complaints Panel process and continue to urge IndoAgri to act immediately to resolve the identified issues and strengthen their palm oil policy and grievance mechanism [and] are reviewing what more we can do to support the RSPO in resolving this serious matter​.”

The company has not revealed further details on any possible connections or joint ventures it may still have with Indofood/Lonsum.

The Indofood-RSPO story background​

In 2016, the three NGOs listed above submitted a formal complaint to RSPO against Indofood’s subsidiaries Lonsum and its parent company PT. Salim Ivomas Pratama Tbk. (Salim Ivomas), citing ‘labour violations on multiple Lonsum plantations in contravention of RSPO Principles and Criteria and its Code of Conduct’​.

This was accompanied by a report entitled ‘The Human Cost of Conflict Palm Oil: Indofood, PepsiCo’s Hidden Link to Worker Exploitation in Indonesia’​, detailing RAN’s 2015 investigation into Lonsum plantations.

Lonsum later revised its sustainable palm oil policy, but this was dismissed by NGOs saying it had ‘critical shortfalls’.​

In a series of letters between IndoAgri/Lonsum and the NGOs via RSPO, the former repeatedly requested for ‘evidence’​ to back up the allegations, but the NGOs refused to reveal their sources in order to protect the workers’ identities and livelihoods until a formal ‘no-repercussions’ arrangement was reached.

Indo-Agri sent this agreement to the RSPO in May 2018, which then led to the RSPO conducting the aforementioned audit and verification visit in June 2018.

The NGOs also requested for a meeting with senior IndoAgri/Indofood representatives including IndoAgri CEO Mark Wakeford, but no results from this meeting, if held, were published on the RSPO website.","Wed, 30 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-asia.com/article/2019/01/30/pepsico-responds-with-disappointment-at-indofood-s-withdrawal-from-rspo-over-disputed-audit-decision/9081016-1-eng-GB/PepsiCo-responds-with-disappointment-at-Indofood-s-withdrawal-from-RSPO-over-disputed-audit-decision.jpg,"['audit', 'withdrawal', 'oil', 'letter', 'disputed', 'lonsum', 'indofood', 'rspo', 'ngos', 'indofoods', 'palm', 'responds', 'pepsico', 'pt', 'decision', 'company', 'disappointment']",

And even if the ""most ambitious"" Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is achieved, one-third of the glaciers would go, according to the Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment.

Glaciers in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya (HKH) region are a critical water source for some 250 million people in the mountains as well as to 1.65 billion others in the river valleys below, the report said.

The glaciers feed 10 of the world's most important river systems, including the Ganges, Indus, Yellow, Mekong and Irrawaddy, and directly or indirectly supply billions of people with food, energy, clean air and income.

Impacts on people from their melting will range from worsened air pollution to more extreme weather, while lower pre-monsoon river flows will throw urban water systems and food and energy production off-kilter, the study warned.

It was published by the Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) in Nepal, one of eight countries on the front line.

Five years in the making, it involved more than 350 researchers and policy experts, 185 organizations, 210 authors, 20 review editors and 125 external reviewers.

""Global warming is on track to transform the frigid, glacier-covered mountain peaks... cutting across eight countries to bare rocks in a little less than a century,"" Philippus Wester of ICIMOD said in a statement.

""This is the climate crisis you haven't heard of.""

Thinning, retreating

The 2015 Paris Agreement's central aim was to keep a global temperature rise this century well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

In December, world leaders at the COP24 talks in Poland agreed on a common rule book to implement the accord, in which countries committed to limiting global temperature rises to well below two degrees Celsius.

But major polluters, including the United States and Saudi Arabia, disputed a landmark scientific report released in October that suggested nations must slash fossil fuel use by nearly half in a little over a decade.

The new report said that even if the 1.5-degrees target is achieved, it would mean a rise of 2.1 degrees in the Himalayas region. If emissions are not reduced, the rise would be five degrees.

The Himalayan glaciers, formed some 70 million years ago, are highly sensitive to changing temperatures. Since the 1970s, they have thinned and retreated, and areas covered by snow and snowfall have decreased.

As the glaciers shrink, hundreds of risky glacial lakes can burst and unleash floods.

Satellite data shows that numbers of such lakes in the region grew to 4,260 in a decade from 3,350 in 1990.

Air pollution from the Indo-Gangetic Plains -- one of the world's most polluted regions -- also deposits black carbon and dust on the glaciers, hastening melting and changing monsoon circulation, the ICIMOD study said.

The region would require up to $4.6 billion per year by 2030 to adapt to climate change, rising to as much as $7.8 billion per year by 2050, according to an estimate in the report.","Tue, 05 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2019/02/04/2019_02_04_64725_1549291077._large.jpg,"['twothirds', 'report', 'temperature', 'melt', 'region', 'study', 'warns', 'global', 'himalayan', 'glaciers', 'rise', 'worlds', 'river', 'degrees']",

An attempt to present the petition in 2017 to the U.N. committee responsible for monitoring the progress of colonized territories toward independence was rebuffed. The chairman of the committee said it couldn’t be accepted because Papua was not part of its mandate.

Highlighting the risks of the endeavor, an activist promoting the petition was arrested by Indonesian authorities in 2017 and sentenced the following year to 10 months in prison. He was arrested again this month along with several others who face treason charges.

Last week they succeeded, aided by the diplomatic equivalent of a wink and a nod from the tiny Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, which has been championing the Papuan cause.

Vanuatu officials had a scheduled meeting last Friday in Geneva with U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet. Among them was an exiled Papuan leader, Benny Wenda, who presented the voluminous petition to Bachelet.

“During this meeting, one member of the Vanuatu delegation, Mr. Benny Wenda, presented the high commissioner with a petition. This was not actually a meeting arranged with Mr. Wenda for that purpose,” said Ravina Shamdasani, deputy spokeswoman at the U.N. Human Rights Office.

Bachelet “was not aware” in advance, she said.

The United Liberation Movement for West Papua sent The Associated Press a photo of Wenda passing the petition to a smiling Bachelet.

Indonesia reacted angrily, accusing Vanuatu of “taking manipulative steps through the infiltration of Benny Wenda into the Vanuatu delegation.”

An insurgency has simmered in Papua since the early 1960s when Indonesia annexed the region, which had remained under Dutch control following Indonesia’s 1945 declaration of independence from the Netherlands. Last month, rebels killed 19 people working on a construction site for a trans-Papua highway in the deadliest attack in years. The Indonesian government denies 20 Papuans were killed in reprisal security operations.

The government says the territory is rightfully its under international law because it was part of the Dutch East Indies empire that is the basis for Indonesia’s modern borders.

But Papuans, culturally and ethnically distinct from the rest of Indonesia, say they were denied the right to decide their own future. Indonesian control was formalized in 1969 with a U.N.-supervised referendum in which little more than 1,000 Papuans were allowed to vote in an atmosphere of heavy intimidation.

Today the region is divided administratively into two provinces, Papua and West Papua, but supporters of independence call the entire region, which makes up the western half of New Guinea, West Papua.

The petition makes several demands of the U.N., including calling on it to review its involvement in the “unlawful annexation” of Papua, to appoint a special representative to investigate the human rights situation, to reinstate Papua on the decolonization committee’s agenda and to conduct an internationally supervised referendum on self-determination.

“Indonesia’s fake referendum included less than 0.2 percent of the population in 1969. The West Papuan People’s Petition of 2017 has 70 percent of the population,” Wenda, who is head of the United Liberation Movement for West Papua, said in a statement.

“Indonesia’s entire claim to West Papua rests on what happened in 1969. That claim is destroyed now,” he said.

He said he and others are “working day and night” to bring the petition to the U.N. General Assembly.

Indonesia’s mission to the U.N. said Vanuatu had “deliberately deceived” Bachelet. It said Indonesia “would never retreat to defend and protect” its territorial sovereignty.

The U.N. reiterated previous statements it has made about Papua. Indonesia in February last year agreed that a U.N. rights delegation could visit Papua, to which Jakarta tightly controls access, but no visit has taken place.

Shamdasani said Bachelet informed the Vanuatu delegation that the U.N. Human Rights Office “has been engaging with the Indonesian authorities on the issue of Papua, including the prevailing human rights situation, and has requested access to Papua.”","Wed, 30 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/4FF94C6E-C814-4730-B431-B184431881E1.jpg,"['petition', 'obstacles', 'indonesia', 'papua', 'region', 'indonesian', 'wenda', 'west', 'despite', 'independence', 'papuans', 'rights', 'human', 'vanuatu']",

With about 1500 tonnes of shedded hay on hand and a RAAF accredited airstrip on Tipperary, he offered the property’s services for RAAF aircraft to fly in and load hay to deliver quickly to needy cattle producers in the Gulf.

That was three days ago.

All he has heard since has been crickets.

Today in frustration he took to Twitter to ask Federal and State political leaders why they were yet to respond while conditions continue to deteriorate for thousands upon thousands of standed, starving cattle:

Well WTF, feeling helpless. On Wednesday through @AgForceQLD we offered our RAAF accredited airstrip to the PM’s office to land planes, load our hay and send to the Gulf flood crisis to help our fellow cattleman. Still waiting to hear back. @troysetter @agintegrity @BoutaNT1976 — David Connolly (@sokitomi) February 8, 2019

AgForce CEO Mike Guerin also took to Twitter to voice his frustration at the ongoing delays:

Premier, we have had B-doubles full of hay waiting to go north since Monday & a military cargo plane waiting on the tarmac at Amberley to take it since Tuesday. Govt of all levels need to ACT NOW before thousands more cattle needlessly die. @qclnews @nqregister @AgForceQLD — Michael Guerin (@MichaelS_Guerin) February 7, 2019

Speaking to Beef Central this afternoon Mr Connolly said he was still yet to hear from the Federal Government.

“We have got a lot of hay, I am sure we can get it down to where it is needed,” he said.

“We would sell it for cost, what it cost us to get it there

“It is our hay that we need to use for our cattle and our export yard, but we’re prepared to put our needs secondary to others’ needs which is keeping cattle alive.

“We sat on our hay becaue we knew how hard it was to get and we needed it, but we don’t need it as bad as these poor blokes with cattle standing in water.

“You’re not going to be able to save all of them but you’re going to save some of them.”

Despite not hearing back Tipperary still loaded it’s own semi-trailer with square bales and sent it to the Cloncurry clearing yards, where it likely to arrive some time this weekend.

Mr Connolly said a RAAF cargo plane from Darwin or Amberley could land, load hay and take it to Cloncurry in a fraction of the time and continue with round trips to stockpile hay.

“Here we are sitting on 1500 tonnes of hay that we could possibly distribute, we have a big airstip they could send the planes up from Amberley or Darwin, but we still haven’t heard anything.”","Fri, 08 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.beefcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/David-Connolly-259x300.jpg,"['govt', 'raaf', 'twitter', 'fed', 'offer', 'ignores', 'blast', 'cattle', 'thousands', 'floods', 'load', 'tipperary', 'connolly', 'need', 'hay', 'heard', 'nq', 'waiting']", 
84,84,FL-2019-000011-IDN,Japan's Kansai airport plans $900m capacity and safety upgrade - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Japan-s-Kansai-airport-plans-900m-capacity-and-safety-upgrade,"OSAKA -- Japan's Kansai International Airport looks to invest about 100 billion yen ($911 million) through 2025 to upgrade the larger terminal, seeking to boost capacity at the country's No. 2 hub for foreign flights.

Kansai Airports, the facility's operator, also plans to bolster disaster protection measures after Typhoon Jebi caused severe flooding at Terminal 1 and one of the airport's two runways in September. The upgrades represent the first large-scale overhaul of the Osaka-area airport in its 25-year history.

The company aims to lift the airport's annual traveler capacity by around 10 million before Osaka hosts the 2025 World Expo. Kansai International welcomes Japan's second-largest count of foreign visitors after the Tokyo area's Narita Airport. It logged a record 28.94 million travelers in 2018 despite being temporarily taken out of commission by the typhoon.

When Terminal 1 opened in 1994, it could handle 25 million international and domestic travelers per year. The later addition of Terminal 2 was intended to lift capacity by 8 million people. The terminals appear to have grown capable of receiving more travelers as procedures like luggage checks become more efficient.

About 60 airlines use Terminal 1, which handles around 80% of all flights to and from the hub. Kansai International is built on a man-made island and has little room to expand, so the upgrades will consist of measures such as rearranging layouts and deploying cutting-edge technology to speed up procedures.

""A competition has arisen worldwide to build more efficient terminals using information technology and other tech, and we'd like to bring those ideas to Kansai International,"" said Yoshiyuki Yamaya, CEO of Kansai Airports. ""We'll strive to finish the renovations before Osaka's 2025 world's fair.""

The airport also will increase square footage for duty-free shops, in response to the growing numbers of visitors to Japan, he said.

In December, Kansai Airports split responsibility for devising disaster countermeasures with New Kansai International Airport Co., the ultimate owner of structures including the runways. Kansai Airports will put about 30 billion yen of its planned investments toward such improvements.

Efforts will include raising seawalls and installing concrete blocks to dissipate waves. Electrical equipment under Terminal 1 will be moved above ground and outfitted to keep out water -- a move prompted by the electrical outages that occurred when flooding from the typhoon reached underground equipment.","Thu, 07 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F5%252F9%252F2%252F4%252F19244295-1-eng-GB%252F20190206N%2520Kansai%2520Airport_Data.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['kansai', 'japans', 'international', 'safety', 'upgrade', '900m', 'plans', 'million', 'capacity', '2025', 'yen', 'travelers', 'terminal', 'airports', 'airport']", 
85,85,FL-2019-000011-IDN,Colombia's disaster-ridden hydropower project runs second largest river dry - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2019/02/colombias-disaster-ridden-hydropower-project-runs-second-largest-river-dry/,"Colombia’s largest hydroelectric project, Hidroituango, has created an ecological disaster after emergency measures reduced water flow from a normal dry-season 450 to 500 cubic meters per second (m3/s) to only 35 m3/s, according to climate monitoring authority IDEAM.

One prominent environmental activist released a video filmed beside the once powerful river that now more closely resembles a slow-moving creek.

In the video, the activist denounced Hidroituango for perpetrating “the greatest environmental crime that has ever happened in Colombia.”

Medellin public utility company EPM, who is behind the mega-project that received Inter-American Development Bank financing, is under investigation for corruption-related charges tied to a 2012 consortium process with Brazilian company Camargo Correa.

Colombia’s environmentalists have declared an ecological disaster after the country’s second most important river, the Cauca, was reduced to less than 10 percent of normal flow after the country’s largest hydroelectric dam project Hidroituango took emergency measures earlier this week.

Medellin energy company EPM took emergency measures to close the second of two floodgates on Tuesday to fill the Hidroituango dam reservoir. The dam was supposed to start producing power in 2018, but it has been plagued by disasters after a machine room collapsed in April of last year, forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate their homes .

Isabel Zuleta, an activist for environmental organization Rios Vivos that works with communities alongside the Cauca, released a video filmed beside the once powerful river that now more closely resembles a slow-moving creek, denouncing EPM for what she described as “the greatest environmental crime that has ever happened in Colombia.”

Environmental activists, politicians and journalists have taken to social media to share photos and videos sent from the frontline defenders and local communities around the river. Fishing communities who depend on the river for their main source of income as well as food security have denounced the mega-project for threatening their livelihoods.

“They took away the little that we had, they took away our peace and brought us worries. The majority of the fisherman are without work, we don’t have anything we can do,” fisherman Jairo Taborda said in an interview with local media Caracol television .

Environmental licensing authority ANLA announced that it had not been informed about the emergency operation until hours before engineers closed the engine room tunnel that had provisionally discharged water after the original discharge tunnels were blocked last year. ANLA has already opened sanctions against EPM for failing to protect the ecological basin located below the dam.

Jorge Londoño, EPM CEO, said the decision was made to protect communities living downstream from the dam. “If we do not close it, it would mean the loss of water control and this could generate, in the medium term, a greater deterioration of the entire internal infrastructure, with a potential impact on the safety and lives of the communities downstream.”

Zuleta rejected the arguments made by EPM that the closure of the floodgates was made in the interest of the communities downstream who she argued were unlikely to be flooded because of dry season and El Niño conditions had lowered water levels. “The worst part about this is that they’re saying they’re shutting down the water in the name of the communities when in reality they’re only doing it to protect their own interests.”

Two members of the activist group Rios Vivos were killed near the Hidroituango dam project within a one-week period in May of last year, bringing the total to five activists who were killed while opposing the dam.

The hydroelectric plant reservoir floods a surface of 11,120 acres. The area was supposed to be cleared of trees and vegetation but experts say the company failed to perform that task which led to build up of organic debris in May 2018, helping to cause the dam’s partial collapse. Local environmental activists claim the dam may displace habitat for jaguars known to roam the area .

The Cauca River starts in the country’s most important watershed known as the Colombian Massif. The river flows 838 miles between two of the country’s three major mountain ranges eventually passing through a massive wetlands area before it joins with the country’s largest river La Magdalena.

EPM said that the floodgates would remain closed until Friday. It remains uncertain whether the operations by the public utility company will be effective in preventing collapse or if the project will ever be completed. The mountainside that supports the dam has been severely eroded by a porous rock interior and serious structural concerns have prevented the project from reaching completion. Experts say the mountain supporting the dam may need to be injected with a concrete filling to prevent an eventual collapse.

Medellin public utility company EPM, which received a $1.1 billion loan package from the Inter-American Development Bank to fund the mega-project, is under investigation by the Prosecutor General’s Office for corruption-related charges tied to a 2012 consortium process with Brazilian conglomerate Camargo Correa.

93,93,FL-2019-000011-IDN,Swedish office workers chill out with lunchtime ice-dip » Borneo Bulletin Online - Borneo Bulletin Online,https://borneobulletin.com.bn/swedish-office-workers-chill-out-with-lunchtime-ice-dip/,"SOLNA, Sweden (AFP) – Late on a snowy Stockholm morning, eight colleagues file down from their office to a small jetty on a nearby lake, change into swimsuits and, one after another, step through a small hole cut into the ice.

For the hardy friends, this pre-lunch dip has become a weekly work ritual – come rain, sun or snow.

At the saltwater Brunnsviken lake, they submerge themselves into the zero-degree Celsius water for a few seconds each, to the cheers of their friends before leaping out and wrapping up in bathrobes.

Some gasp as they step down a small ladder, surrounded by the snow-covered ice covering the lake. Others yelp, and two of them dunk their heads under the water before heaving themselves out.

The group, aged between 34 and 61, started out in 2017 in a bid to beat the post-holiday blues when some friends, all colleagues in the marketing department of a company in the suburbs of Stockholm, proposed a swim one lunchtime.

“We started going swimming in the summer when it was lovely and warm, and we thought ‘We wonder how long we can keep doing this?’,” said Karin Wallford, a member of the group, wrapped up in a woolly hat and thick coat after she took her icy dip.

But the group, which is usually between six and eight swimmers, kept up their weekly swims even as the biting Swedish cold set in and ice formed on the lake – and even enjoyed it.

“It feels like you have, in some way, rebooted your mind,” said Michael Porselid after his swim.

The group was forced to take a break last winter when ice on the lake, which feeds into the Baltic sea, became too thick to cut in February and March.

But this year, the colleagues plan to enjoy their ice-dip no matter how cold it gets, using saws, snow shovels and branches from the trees lining the lake to open a hole in the ice to keep on swimming.

“I’m quite nervous, but when I finally do it I’m so happy I went,” said Annica Gunnrin, energised after her swim and dressed against the cold again.

“I never regret going swimming.”","Sat, 26 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/BB_650-3.jpg,"['lunchtime', 'thick', 'workers', 'office', 'water', 'lake', 'weekly', 'small', 'friends', 'ice', 'colleagues', 'group', 'icedip', 'swedish', 'chill', 'cold']", 
94,94,FL-2019-000011-IDN,"Rising seas: to keep humans safe, let nature shape the coast - The Conversation UK",https://theconversation.com/rising-seas-to-keep-humans-safe-let-nature-shape-the-coast-107837,"Even under the most conservative climate change scenarios, sea levels 30cm higher than at present seem all but certain on much of the UK’s coast by the end of this century. Depending on emission scenarios, sea levels one metre higher than at present by 2100 are also plausible.

The knee-jerk reaction to sea level rise has traditionally been to maintain the shoreline’s position at all cost, by building new flood defence structures or upgrading old ones. More than US$10 billion per year is already spent worldwide on “grey” infrastructure such as concrete walls and levies to protect against coastal flooding. Equally large are the costs incurred when coastal defences fail.

The United Nations has called on governments to relocate public facilities and infrastructure from flood-prone areas, while the UK Climate Change Committee has urged the government to “set out how and when the hard choices that have to be made on the coast are going to happen”.

Letting nature decide

The traditional approach of “grey” engineered sea defences locks society into ever increasing costs of replacement and maintenance. The alternatives are “nature-based solutions” to coastal flooding and erosion, which work with natural processes to reduce flood risk and incorporate ecosystems into flood defence.

Rather than seeing the coast as a static line, these alternatives rethink the coastlines as zones with valuable habitats such as beaches, dunes and wetlands that act as carbon stores, places for recreation and natural buffers against the waves.

Schemes such as the Wild Coast Project at Wallasea on the UK’s east coast have restored salt marshes where land had been reclaimed for agriculture years earlier. The tide and waves now regenerate salt marsh where it had been embanked and drained. If designed well, such schemes create new habitat which can reduce the height and intensity of storm surges and lower flood risk.

This technique for managing sea level rise can be thought of as allowing nature the space to create new coastal habitats within well-defined boundaries, akin to flooding a “sandpit”. In this sandpit, enough coastal space is vacated by humans to give natural processes room to respond to sea level rise by creating new wetlands further inland where once the terrain was dry.

While such interventions do not enable full control over water levels and waves, they are designed to keep them at a safe distance from humans. Nature may be allowed to have some freedom to “play in the sandpit” created for it and people may not care what type of salt marsh or mudflat forms at Wallasea. But, as with “grey” infrastructure, humans ultimately build the sandpit by setting its boundaries.

The future of the world’s coastlines, however, is uncertain as the coast is inherently dynamic. Every wave and tide shapes the coast such that it determines how the next wave and tide can shape it. Though people may not notice it, the coast and the habitats which line it are never fixed and in fact change a great deal over a single human lifetime. People may create pockets of space for nature and think they are in control when in fact humans never were and it is doubtful they ever can be.

Observing nature’s sandpit

This is amply illustrated by the freshwater grazing marshes at Blakeney in Norfolk, on the UK’s east coast, where embankments were breached during the 2013 storm surge. A storm surge at sea forced salt water through an embankment into the Blakeney Freshes nature reserve, a unique freshwater wetland. Though unintended, salt water flooding of embanked areas like the Freshes can create a new ecosystem there and prevent flood waters from rising in adjacent areas, where people would have come to harm.

The Blakeney Freshes illustrate the importance of allowing sufficient space for nature to decide the boundaries of its “sandpit”. The more space given to it and the wider the buffer zone of coastal landforms, the lower the risk of flooding to areas that lie further inland.

As with weather forecasts, predicting how complex natural processes will interact at the coast is difficult – certainly over years and decades. It is time people stopped pretending that nature can be controlled at all, whether through “grey” or “green” engineering schemes. The best option is to watch and learn.

The means for monitoring exist, with ever-improving measurement technology, data transmission and high-resolution satellite imagery, such as the European Commission’s Copernicus programme.

Responding to sea level rise may be as simple as allowing space for the flow of water and sediment during extreme events. Society can do so by relinquishing the need to control the process and restricting development near the coast, creating areas that nature can “claim” with whatever habitat it wishes to “build” there.

As a salt marsh turns into a tidal flat, a freshwater field into a salty lagoon, there is the opportunity to stand back, watch and learn to better understand how and why those changes happen and how people can benefit from change rather than fight a losing battle to prevent it.","Thu, 07 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/257489/original/file-20190206-174851-qbi2of.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['sea', 'humans', 'safe', 'flooding', 'sandpit', 'shape', 'let', 'coast', 'areas', 'salt', 'rising', 'flood', 'nature', 'space', 'coastal', 'seas']",

96,96,FL-2019-000011-IDN,the shelter project provides victims of lombok earthquakes with 700 dollar houses - Designboom,https://www.designboom.com/architecture/jasmine-mariani-shelter-project-victims-lombok-earthquakes-700-dollar-houses-02-04-2019/,"in july of 2018, a series of devastating earthquakes struck the island of lombok, indonesia, killing hundreds and leaving thousands without homes. through identification of available resources, the shelter project was founded as a response to the desperate need for housing. built under the guidance of bali-based architect jasmine mariani, the shelters use natural materials, include a water catchment system, electrical fittings, and can be built in 4 days.



due to trauma and fear, many families chose to stay together in the smaller sized house as they felt safer

the project encourages affected communities to build, maintain and personalize their shelter, ensuring they are involved in the entire process. the goal is to empower village leaders by providing the expertise and means to build functional, comfortable and safe temporary shelters whilst awaiting a government action plan to rebuild long term facilities for the communities of lombok.



materials are locally sourced and funds are recirculated back into the island’s economy

the design developed is available to everyone and can be replicated in other affected and/or low-income areas, with the adaptation of local resources. the team has developed three prototypes before settling on the final design, which can be completed for a total of 700usd. the first few houses used bamboo trunks for the wall panels, but this material had become scarce and of low quality because of the sudden rise of demand for it. so, the team has re-adapted the designs, working with locals and identified a thick woven sheeting as the best solution to build panels with.



the houses are constructed in 4/5 days in teams of 3/4 people

the suppliers remain local, the materials natural, and the carbon footprint at a minimum. the construction is simple and can be taught between communities, requiring no electrical tools or heavy machinery. houses are fitted with a water catchment system which leads to a filtration tank that the team provides. electrical wiring is also connected to existing power lines so that the houses are equipped with sockets and emergency lamps.



village heads acting as project managers and workers are compensated with a fee for helping other village members to build their houses

houses are built by the locals displaced by natural disasters — it is a community effort



the construction uses traditional, manual building techniques making it easy to learn



recycled plastic bottles are used to provide protection to wooden legs from deterioration



the shelter project was developed to be accessible to everyone — documents and information can be found online



the team worked with locals to find the perfect size for the shelters, settling on 4m x 4m



each house is built on a plot of land owned/rented by the individual



one shelter costs 700USD and includes all electrical fittings and a water catchment system

97,97,FL-2019-000011-IDN,Arashi stepping out of celebrity storm to seek new life - The Jakarta Post - Jakarta Post,https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2019/01/28/arashi-stepping-out-of-celebrity-storm-to-seek-new-life.html,"In announcing Sunday his band's plan to go on a hiatus, Arashi leader Satoshi Ono became the latest of a number of top Japanese idols to step out of the spotlight in recent years -- whether it is just taking time off, disbanding or retiring -- to seek a different life.

The J-pop culture landscape has been shaken by a number of such departures lately, most notably the December 2016 breakup of SMAP, one of Japan's most enduring and beloved bands, following a rift among its members on whether they should quit their agent Johnny & Associates Inc., the major talent agency to which Arashi also belongs.

Even the Chief Cabinet Secretary is shocked by the news and wishes Arashi all the best for the remaining time with the fans https://t.co/N86LH7NNE4 — Oh, No. (@AiHondaa) January 28, 2019

It was about half a year after SMAP's disbandment that Ono, 38, began consulting his band mates about his desire to ""live freely"" and leave the entertainment industry ""to see views that I've never seen.""

Those joining Johnny & Associates with the aspiration of becoming idols typically start their careers as young teenagers, often as backup dancers for their established seniors.

""(Arashi) members have been chasing their dream since they were in their teens, so I, as one of their seniors who is also a member of an (idol) group, can totally understand the complicated feelings that arise as one progresses into adulthood,"" said Taichi Kokubun, a member of TOKIO, another popular band managed by Johnny & Associates.

""I think it's not a bad idea to stop and take a breather,"" the 44-year-old said.

While noting that Arashi's announcement most certainly came as a total surprise to many given the fact that the members are known for getting along well, Edogawa University professor Noboru Saijo said the group's decision was understandable. Arashi means storm in Japanese.

""There is a gap between one's image as an idol and one's actual image as an individual, and as one ages, it becomes more and more difficult to strike a balance between them,"" said Saijo, an expert in idol theory. ""There was probably a shift in the members' consciousness with regard to how to continue being an idol.""

Arashi will celebrate the 20th anniversary of its debut in November, with no scandals or misconduct on its record. While it might not have been smooth sailing for the five-man band in its early years, the members always consulted each other to find a way out.

The breakthrough came in 2005, when the teen romance TV drama ""Hana yori dango"" starring Arashi member Jun Matsumoto became a big hit.

In the following year, other members also broke new ground, with Sho Sakurai becoming a newscaster on a popular news program and Kazunari Ninomiya starring in the Clint Eastwood film ""Letters from Iwo Jima.""

The band climbed the stairway to national stardom, emceeing public broadcaster NHK's annual New Year's Eve music extravaganza ""Kohaku Utagassen"" from 2010 for five years in a row.

A record 52 Arashi titles have topped the weekly hits rankings tallied by Oricon Inc., a major entertainment information provider, since the band's debut in 1999. The group has also ranked top in Oricon News rankings of popular artists a record eight times.

The group's growing popularity, however, was accompanied by the loneliness of being top celebrities, Ono once revealed in an interview in 2011. For example, Ono said some old friends started speaking to him in honorific language, which in Japanese typically conveys social distance or disparity of rank.

With their success spreading beyond music and spanning various genres, including hosting their own prime time variety shows on television, the effort needed to remain at the top became even more taxing.

""I've been contemplating over and over since yesterday with regard to 'I want to live freely,'"" Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa tweeted on Monday in an apparent reference to Ono's announcement the previous day. ""I wonder what it is like to live freely.""

""I guess whether one is living freely is really up to oneself,"" Maezawa said in another tweet later in the day, while applauding Arashi members as well as the band's fans for being ""warmhearted"" and ""awesome"" in their response.

During Sunday's press conference, a reporter questioned whether Arashi's decision to suspend their activities was ""irresponsible."" This immediately drew flak from fans and others on social media.

Genta Aoki, a Nippon Television Network Corp. reporter known for being a great fan of Arashi, tweeted after covering the event himself, ""The word 'irresponsible' came up at the press conference. Now that is absolutely incorrect. It's so regrettable and being there where it happened, I felt mortified.""

Japanese neuroscientist Kenichiro Mogi also came to Arashi's defense, writing on his official Japanese blog, ""By announcing in advance that they are going to continue performing until the end of 2020 (there're still almost two years to go!) and then go on a hiatus, I believe members of Arashi have sufficiently fulfilled the 'responsibility' that this reporter is talking about.""

Using The Beatles as an example, Mogi questioned whether the artists' careers would have excelled the way they have had the band continued to perform out of a sense of responsibility.

Prediction: loss 100 billion yen annually due to Arashi hiatus. This is their impact for economy sectors. https://t.co/uHsBOfhzQt — Sakurai Sho (@sakuraifacts) January 28, 2019

""What more are you asking for?"" wrote Mogi, who often appears on TV and is a celebrity in his own right, urging the reporter himself to stop forcing responsibility on others and live more freely. ""Artists shine when they have spiritual freedom. The same goes for everyone else as well those who are not artists.""

In western Japan's Hiroshima, 74-year-old Norimoto Urano recalled a visit by Arashi member Matsumoto to a local evacuation shelter about two weeks after the area was hit by disastrous floods and landslides, and said the idol listened patiently to those affected and generously made himself available for photos.

""I think there must have been sacrifices they've made in their private lives,"" Urano said. ""I would like to thank them and say cheers for the good work.""

On social media, fans expressed their sadness but largely stayed positive, with many pledging to await Ono's return after his ""summer vacation"" and others coming up with hilarious memes and predictions of what the band leader will do during his time off.

Under Monday's top trending Japanese hashtag ""Ono-kun's summer vacation,"" Twitter user @ayatuki_0111 posted a doodle imagining a group chat among Arashi members on the LINE messaging app, showing Ono -- known for his love of fishing -- with his catch of the day while traveling around the world and the cheerful responses of the other members.

Among other top stars who have retired recently were Namie Amuro, the music and fashion icon whose final concert tour drew about 800,000 fans before ending her career in September 2018. Tackey & Tsubasa, the Johnny & Associates idol duo featuring Hideaki Takizawa and Tsubasa Imai, also disbanded the same month.

Meanwhile, another popular singer, Kana Nishino, has announced she will suspend all entertainment activities after completing her concerts in February to try out different things aside from music.","Tue, 29 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2019/01/28/2019_01_28_64139_1548673090._large.jpg,"['seek', 'arashi', 'fans', 'band', 'reporter', 'ono', 'japanese', 'popular', 'music', 'members', 'stepping', 'life', 'storm', 'celebrity', 'idol']", 
98,98,FL-2019-000011-IDN,LGBT teen Bilal Hassani shines as France's Eurovision pick - Jakarta Post,https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2019/01/28/lgbt-teen-shines-as-frances-eurovision-pick.html,"At the tender age of 19, Bilal Hassani is already being held up as an inspiration to LGBT teenagers -- and now he's got his sights on winning the Eurovision Song Contest.

C'est @iambilalhassani qui remporte #DestinationEurovision ce soir ! Revivez son parcours qui se termine en apothéose !#Eurovision pic.twitter.com/3cQ7IzotFm — Eurovision France 🇫🇷 (@EurovisionF2) January 27, 2019

An internet sensation, Hassani beat better known singers to clinch Saturday night's public vote to represent France in the glitter-soaked competition in Israel in May.

""I am very proud to represent in being 100 percent myself, despite people who might say on the internet that I don't represent France,"" he said Sunday evening on French television.

Born to a Moroccan family, the Beyonce fan has delighted in proving wrong critics who laughed at the singer they dismissed as an ""Arab in a wig"".

""I've been a Eurovision addict since I was nine, as much for the artistry as for what it symbolises -- all the cultures and differences that are brought together by music,"" he said on Instagram.

With a penchant for wigs -- each of which has a pet name, including a blonde called ""Paris"" and a brunette called ""Gila"" -- Hassani is unapologetic about what he stands for.

""I am me, and I know I will always be. I am free,"" he sings in ""Roi"" (""King""), the song he is hoping will become France's first victorious Eurovision entry since 1977.

Hassani is vocal about his sexuality and rejection of old ideas about masculinity, delighting in a gender-bending wardrobe.

Heavily made up a la Kim Kardashian -- albeit far less curvy -- his success owes much to his big personality, flaunting what he calls his ""fabulousness"".

Encouraging messages flooded in on Hassani's YouTube channel after he was picked for Eurovision on Saturday.

""I wanted to thank you --- even if you don't read this comment, it's thanks to you that I've managed to have confidence in myself,"" wrote one fan.

1,500 hateful tweets

But beyond the tide of support, Hassani has also had to grapple with a violent online hate campaign from homophobes and racists.

Campaign group Urgence Homophobie said it had already identified ""more than 1,500 insulting, discriminatory or threatening tweets linked to his sexual orientation and/or appearance"".

The NGO has joined forces with another group, Stop Homophobie, to take to court ""every person who has insulted, threatened, or discriminated against"" Hassani.

The young singer has tried to take it in his stride, telling reporters that winning ""the votes of so many French people"" on Saturday was ""the best response to the haters"".

Hassani has taken singing and dance classes since his early years, appearing on children's talent show ""The Voice Kids"" at the age of 15.

For his audition, he opted to perform a song by one of his idols -- Conchita Wurst, the Austrian bearded diva who won Eurovision in 2014.

He became a YouTuber shortly after and has since won nearly 800,000 subscribers, with videos -- often humorous -- that start with him belting out a tuneful ""Bonsoir, Paris!""

With titles like ""The time I fell in love with a straight guy!"", some videos are confessional, while others feature make-up tutorials or covers of songs by stars such as Ed Sheeran and Ariana Grande.

His Eurovision entry, co-written with last year's French contenders Madame Monsieur, has already racked up nearly six million views online.

In any case, Hassani is already looking beyond the competition in Tel Aviv: his debut album is due out this spring, under the French label Low Wood.","Mon, 28 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2019/01/28/2019_01_28_64096_1548651081._large.jpg,"['winning', 'song', 'french', 'represent', 'won', 'teen', 'bilal', 'eurovision', 'pick', 'france', 'shines', 'videos', 'hassani', 'frances', 'singer', 'lgbt']",
