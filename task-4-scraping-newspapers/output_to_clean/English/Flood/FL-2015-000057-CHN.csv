Ask Mrs. Chen about her home or hobbies and you may get a word or two. Ask her about water flow or the Ohio River and she will talk for hours. Some 25 million people live along the Ohio River basin, which runs more than 900 miles from Pittsburgh to Cairo, Ill., where it joins the Mississippi River. Along the way, it flows through locks and dams operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Mrs. Chen developed a forecasting model for predicting floods along the Ohio and its tributaries. The model involves constant data-gathering about water levels and rainfall, as well as how dam and lock operators respond to water flow.

Mrs. Chen was known to be tenacious in her pursuit of data for her predictions. She developed carpal-tunnel syndrome in her right hand from eight years of repetitive mouse clicks. Thomas Adams, who hired Mrs. Chen at the National Weather Service in 2007, said her fascination with data made her perfect for the job.

“Sherry is and was dedicated to getting the details right — and that matters significantly,” Mr. Adams said, noting that one inch of water could make the difference between a levee holding or failing.

Mrs. Chen would return to Beijing every year to visit her parents, which is how her troubles began. During her 2012 trip, a nephew said that his future father-in-law was in a payment dispute with provincial officials over a water pipeline.

The nephew knew that one of Mrs. Chen’s former hydrology classmates, Jiao Yong, had become vice minister of China’s Ministry of Water Resources, which oversees much of China’s water infrastructure. As Mrs. Chen tells it, her nephew asked her to reach out to Mr. Jiao, hoping he might be able to help his future wife’s father. Mrs. Chen said she was reluctant to do so since she had not seen Mr. Jiao in many years, but ultimately contacted him.

Mr. Jiao’s secretary set up a 15-minute chat in his office in downtown Beijing, and Mr. Jiao said he would try to intercede. As their conversation wound down, he also mentioned that he was in the process of funding repairs for China’s aging reservoir systems and was curious how such projects were funded in the United States.","Sat, 09 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/10/business/ESPIONAGE/ESPIONAGE-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=6391523c6f1c93e7241d3b5bddd82a34844de5f4b358e61854880663914d3bea&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"['jiao', 'spying', 'chen', 'nephew', 'chinas', 'united', 'wasnt', 'ohio', 'mr', 'water', 'river', 'mrs', 'accused', 'china']",

3,3,FL-2015-000057-CHN,Woman to Sue Over Police Killing of Her Son in China's Heilongjiang - Radio Free Asia,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/police-05122015143505.html,"The mother of a man shot dead by police in China's northeastern province of Heilongjiang has rejected a compensation offer from the government, saying she has hired lawyers to pursue the police officer responsible, media reports said on Tuesday.

Xu Chunhe was killed in a police shooting incident in front of his elderly mother and three young children at a railway station in Heilongjiang's Suihua city earlier this month, and while a police investigation has claimed he was in the wrong, the authorities have offered the family 200,000 yuan (U.S.$32,198) in compensation.

But Xu's mother, Qian Yushun, who was placed in an elderly care facility by police following the incident, has hired lawyers to bring the officer who shot her son to justice, the Guangzhou-based Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper said.

One of Qian's lawyers, Xie Yanyi, said the internal police investigation into the shooting was an ambiguous affair.

""It wasn't made clear whether this case was actually registered, or whether or not it was a criminal investigation,"" Xie told RFA on Tuesday.

""There is also crucial information about the facts of the case which isn't provided.""

Xie said the shooting comes against the political background of a fraud investigation announced on Tuesday into Suihua municipal party secretary Dong Guosheng, which Xie said will have an impact on how Xu's shooting is handled.

Threat to the public?

Xu, 45, got into a confrontation with an officer in China's railway police at Suihua's Qing'an station on May 2.

Police later claimed he was assaulting police and posing obvious threat to public security, Xinhua news agency reported at the time.

""The middle-aged man ... forcibly prevented passengers from going through the security inspection gate,"" the agency quoted a railway police spokesman as saying.

""When a policeman on patrol tried to stop him, the man picked up a child and threw him at the police. In the chaos, he also tried to grab the policeman's gun and club,"" it said.

Police officer Li Lebin opened fire to keep the passengers safe, but called for emergency medical assistance soon after, Xinhua said.

Excessive force

Rights activist Yu Xinshui said the shooting was an excessive use of force.

""There is nowhere for people to go to redress injustice; all the doors are closed to them,"" Yu said.

""They are even detained on the train, but even if they are detained, they shouldn't be shooting people dead; they could have shot him non-lethally.""

""There was no reason to kill this man outright,"" he said.

Yu said Dong's public support for police in the wake of the incident gave out the wrong message.

""When a citizen was killed, [Dong] went to pay a visit to the police. Does this mean that [a county-level leader] sanctions the killing of ordinary citizens?"" he said.

Only for show

Fellow rights attorney Liu Shuqing welcomed the news of Dong's investigation, accusing him of covering up for the police.

""If the guy who tried to aid and abet them is in this situation, then that's good for us,"" Liu said.

Online rights activist Wu Gan, known by his online nickname ""The Butcher,"" said he believes that the investigation into the shooting was done merely for show.

""The result of this so-called investigation was that they [spun it as] a matter of stability maintenance, and made sure that the media played along,"" Wu said.

""If they would just release the [CCTV] video, they wouldn't need to investigate; they could just pursue whoever was responsible,"" said Wu, who has helped Qian's lawyers find eyewitnesses to build their case.

""But how can this be a credible investigation if they won't even make the video public?""

The case has divided Chinese online opinion, with some regarding Li as a hero, and others saying Xu was killed because he planned to complain about the government to higher authorities.

Flood of complaints

China's ""letters and visits"" complaints system is flooded with some 22,000 new complaints daily across the country, according to government figures from 2013.

But petitioning to higher authorities has been banned in cases where the local government hasn't addressed the issue, and many who try to do so say they are stonewalled, detained in ""black jails,"" beaten, and harassed by the authorities.

It is unclear what Xu may have been complaining about, but many petitioners seek redress for alleged cases of official wrongdoing—including forced evictions, beatings in custody, and corruption linked to lucrative land sales.

Xu Nailai, a petitioner from the northern port city of Tianjin, received threats by telephone after some 600 people signed a petition calling for a full investigation into Xu Chunhe's death.

""I got a call from someone with a northeastern accent yesterday, asking me if I had posted online, and cursing me out in a particularly filthy way,"" Xu Nailai said.

""Then they said I shouldn't get involved in this affair [by gathering signatures].""

""Since yesterday, they have been going from door to door trying to find me and my daughter,"" Xu Nailai said. ""I guess that in calling for the truth to be made public, I must have crossed a line.""

4,4,FL-2015-000057-CHN,The great bobachee-connah - The Economist,https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2015/05/14/the-great-bobachee-connah,"Flood of Fire. By Amitav Ghosh. John Murray; 616 pages; £20. To be published in America by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in August.

THIS is the last volume in a rich and sweeping trilogy set across the vastness of maritime Asia. The historical backdrop is England’s looming first opium war with China (1839-42). But the magic of these novels—along with much of the narrative propulsion—comes from the way Amitav Ghosh weaves together and then apart and then together again the fates of those aboard a former slave ship, the Ibis,carrying convicts and indentured workers from Calcutta bound for Mauritius.

The first volume, “Sea of Poppies”, launched the Ibis out into a great ocean of words—away from the hot, dusty north Indian plain and the godowns and opium factories on the silt-laden Hooghly river to the sapphire waters of the Bay of Bengal. There is nothing like a ship for overturning the established order—unless it is a good storm, and in “River of Smoke” (2011), the sequel, a powerful one combines and scatters the characters in bewitching ways. In a brilliant feat of parallel narratives, “Flood of Fire” slowly recombines those and related characters as they all converge, as if by kismet, on the Ibis and on Hong Kong just at the time of the British colony’s founding.

In north-east India, Kesri is soldiering in an East India Company regiment until ostracised by the senior sepoy (to whom he is related through marriage) for the alleged misdeeds of his beloved younger sister, Deeti. Escaping the oppression, he signs up for what turns out to be a punitive expedition that the British are preparing against the Chinese, who have banned imports from India of the iniquitous opium they called “foreign mud”.

In Bombay’s community of Parsis, Shireen Modi learns of the death on the China coast of her husband, a trader who had bet all on selling a huge consignment of opium just as the Chinese were cracking down. She wants to know more about his end, and salvage a lost fortune. Neel, a bankrupt Raja falsely accused of forgery (he was one of the Ibis convicts), finds himself in Canton (present-day Guangzhou) drawn to help the Chinese authorities against the English. And in Calcutta the former first mate on the Ibis, Zachary Reid, ivory-skinned but hiding his black ancestry, is repairing a houseboat that once belonged to Neel but which had been acquired by the wealthy English opium trader who broke him. Much of this first part of the novel is hilarious, not least the way Zachary’s priapism is treated, with missionary zeal, by the trader’s wife. “It’s my turn now,” she proclaims, “to bajow your ganta.”

As ever for Mr Ghosh, language is a great tumasher, and it is not surprising that he is on the shortlist for the biennial Man Booker International prize, the winner of which will be announced on May 19th. He swims with relish in a lexicon he has made his own, a rich brew of English, Bangla, Hindi, Parsi, Malay, Cantonese and pidgin at a time when free trade and imperialism were recombining Asian cultures and tongues. He describes a “plural society” existing nearly a century before John Furnivall, a British colonial administrator, came up with the term. Mr Ghosh’s genius is to paint this world from its teeming heart, rather than from the perspective of metropolitan centres of power in London or, for that matter, Peking.

Furnivall was in fact a critic of the plural society: he called it “in the strictest sense a medley” in which different races “mix but do not combine. Each group holds by its own religion, its own culture and language, its own ideas and ways. As individuals they meet, but only in the market-place, in buying and selling.” Mr Ghosh is mesmerised by the mixing. But, you sense, he is just as critical of the amorality of free trade underpinned by imperialism as was Furnivall, a Fabian socialist. At anchor off the Chinese coast, a Scottish trader likens hindering the opium trade to holding back the ocean’s tides. The drug’s flow “was governed by abstract laws like those that Mr Newton had applied to the movements of the planets.” This was balm to Zachary’s ears, a budding trader himself.

By now, however, the novel has changed tone. A British military expedition wreaks havoc along this part of the China coast—and on many of the central characters. Kesri is sickened by the expression in death of a Chinese soldier fighting for everything he holds dear—land, homes, families, customs. Neel, watching the almost casual destruction of Chinese forces in the Pearl river delta, is struck by how a battle is “a distillation of time: years and years of preparation, decades of innovation and change were squeezed into a clash of very short duration. And when it was over the impact radiated backwards and forwards through time, determining the future and even, in a sense, changing the past.” There was a terrible power “contained within these wrinkles in time”.

The novel’s end vividly marks the birth of a British colony that grew to be extraordinary. Yet it is more than anything apocalyptic, including for many of the central characters. There is escape for some, however, among them Kesri and Neel, and Neel’s little boy, Raju, newly reunited with his father. And redemption comes in the form—what else?—of the Ibis.","Thu, 14 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.economist.com/img/b/595/335/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20150516_BKD001_0.jpg,"['chinese', 'ghosh', 'trade', 'ibis', 'bobacheeconnah', 'mr', 'british', 'neel', 'opium', 'trader', 'characters', 'great']", 
5,5,FL-2015-000057-CHN,Flood of new dam projects threatens world’s last wild rivers - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/16/hydropower-dams-projects-wild-rivers-worldwide,"Have you ever seen a truly wild river, without human management, settlements or dams? Well, your chances are decreasing. Concern over fossil fuel use is leading to a huge rise in hydroelectric projects. China is building hundreds of dams, some on Asia’s last wild rivers: the Salween (called the Nu in China) and the Brahmaputra (Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet).

Europe is also in the grip of a dam bonanza. According to the NGO Riverwatch, more than 570 sizeable dam projects are being planned in the Balkans alone. This is particularly controversial as many of Europe’s untouched rivers are in this area, which is home to an estimated 40% of the continent’s snails and mussels, plus 69 endemic fish species, among them the huchen – a rare Danube salmon. Even a small country like Macedonia has more than 400 proposed hydro projects.

For years, there was a consensus that dam building was a flawed practice. Huge projects in the 1950s and 1960s were found by a World Bank report to have underproduced electricity and mainly benefited mining corporations. The effects were almost all bad: species extinction; angry, displaced people; and lost cultural heritage.

But dam building is back in fashion. In Romania, campaigners are fighting to protect the Raul Alb, one of the country’s few untouched rivers. It is 22km long, but its influence and importance are massive.

Romanian biologist Calin Dejeu says: “The Raul Alb is unbelievably wild, with old forest around it and no roads. A dam will utterly change that.” Like many others, this project has slipped through without much protest, partly because it is so remote and unknown.

Slovenia’s Sava river is much longer at 990km, with several settlements, but 11 proposed dams threaten a huchen hotspot. This issue has fuelled a campaign, Save the Blue Heart of Europe. There are plans for 33 hydro projects on Albania’s Vjosa river, which will thwart local hopes of a wild river national park to attract tourists. In Turkey, the Ilisu dam is planned on the Tigris. Britain pulled out of funding, but the Turkish government has pressed on, despite strong opposition from the estimated 78,000 affected residents. One casualty would be the ancient Kurdish city of Hasankeyf.



The World Bank, dissuaded from providing dam finance for a few years, is now back. Proposed contenders are the Inga 3 on the Congo, the biggest hydro project in African history, and other giant structures on the Zambezi. They all aim to sell electricity to mining firms and South African consumers.

Back in eastern Europe, the projects threaten to spoil wilderness areas, which will never recover and will never have a chance to realise any tourism potential. “It’s a critical moment,” says Dejeu. “The valley is guarded, mafia-style, by the owner of the company and ‘volunteers’, with clubs and dogs. I’ve filed a legal protest about the illegal deforestation, which has started, but the authorities are doing nothing.”","Sat, 16 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2015/5/13/1431527957016/Hasankeyf-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0761c59967bbe9cc2dcdcb1ba7d51b62,"['wild', 'flood', 'building', 'worlds', 'projects', 'proposed', 'dams', 'dam', 'river', 'rivers', 'threatens', 'hydro', 'planned']", 
6,6,FL-2015-000057-CHN,A user-friendly database of coastal flooding in the United Kingdom from 1915–2014 - Nature.com,https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201521,"The database utilizes data from three main sources and involves three main stages of analysis, as explained below and illustrated in Fig. 1.

Figure 1: Stages of analysis and data sources. Schematic overview of the multi-staged procedure used to compile the database with data sources. Full size image

Data sources

The first and primary dataset used is records from the UK National Tide Gauge Network, available from the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) archive (Data Citation 1). We used these records to identify high sea level events that had the potential to cause coastal flooding. This network consists of 43 operational tide gauges, and was set up as a result of the severe flooding in 1953. It is owned by the EA and maintained by the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) Tide Gauge Inspectorate. We used data from 40 of the network’s tide gauges (Fig. 2); two sites in Northern Ireland (Bangor and Portrush), and Jersey in the Channel Islands were omitted. This is because the sea level exceedance probabilities (see description of second data type below) used to assign return periods to high waters, are currently available for only England, Scotland and Wales. The longest record is at Newlyn Cornwall, which started in 1915, and the shortest is at Bournemouth (Dorset), which started in 1996 (Fig. 2; Table 1). Newlyn has been maintained as the principal UK tide gauge since 1915 and is recognised as one of the best quality sea level records in the world26. The mean data length for all considered gauges is 38 years. At the time of analysis, quality-controlled records were available until the end of 2014. The data frequency prior to 1993 was hourly and from January 1993 onwards increased to 15-minute resolution.

Table 1 Names and locations of study sites. Full size table

The second type of data is sea level exceedance probabilities, estimated recently in a national study27,28 commissioned by the EA. Exceedance probabilities, often called return periods/levels, convey information about the likelihood of rare event such as floods. For example, a 1 in 50 year return level is where there is a 1 in 50 chance of that level being exceeded in a year. We used these return levels to define a threshold for selecting high waters at each site, that were likely to have resulted in coastal flooding. In the EA study, a method, called the Skew Surge Joint Probability Method (SSJPM), was developed and used to estimate sea level exceedance probabilities at the 40 national tide gauge sites on the English, Scottish and Welsh coasts (and five additional sites where long records were available). A multi-decadal hydrodynamic model hindcast was used to interpolate these estimates around the coastlines at 12 km resolution. We extracted (using the information listed in Table 4.1 of McMillian et al.27) the return levels for 16 return periods (from 1 in 1 to 1 in 10,000 years), for each of the 40 sites. By interpolating these 16 return periods, at each site, we were able to estimate the return period of each extracted high water.

The third type of data is a global meteorological dataset of mean sea level pressure and near-surface wind fields from the 20th Century Reanalysis, Version 229 (Data Citation 2). We used this data to track storms associated with the high waters that exceeded our chosen threshold (a 1 in 5 year return level). These data are available at a spatial resolution of 2° every 6 h from 1871–2012. 2013 and 2014 are not covered by the 20th Century Reanalysis, so we used a supplementary and similar dataset from the US National Center for Environmental Predictions/National Center for Atmospheric Research’s (NCEP/NCAR) Reanalysis, Version 230 (Data Citation 3). These fields are also available every 6 h (since 1948) but have a horizontal resolution of 2.5°. For consistency, we spatially interpolated the data onto the 2° 20th Century Reanalysis grid. We used the data between latitudes 30°N and 85°N and longitudes 75°W and 20°E; the area where extra-tropical storms that track towards and influence the UK are generated.

Stage 1: Deriving the high water dataset

The first stage to create the database was to establish when high waters (that were recorded from the available records) reached or exceeded a threshold (for this we used the 1 in 5 year return level, for reasons explained below), at each of the 40 tide gauge sites. This identified events that had the potential to cause coastal flooding.

First, measured sea levels at each of the 40 tide gauge sites were separated into tidal and non-tidal components31 so that the relative contribution of tide and surge could later be identified. The tidal component is the regular rise and fall of the sea caused by the astronomical forces of the Earth, Moon and Sun. The non-tidal residual component remains once the astronomical tidal component has been removed. This primarily contains the meteorological contribution termed the surge, but may also contain harmonic prediction errors or timing errors, and non-linear interactions32. It is for this reason that we estimate skew surge29, rather than the traditionally-used, non-tidal residual at high water. A skew surge is the difference between the maximum observed level and the maximum predicted tidal level regardless of their timing during the tidal cycle. There is one skew surge value per tidal cycle. The advantage of using skew surge is that it is an integrated and unambiguous measure of the storm surge. The tidal component was estimated using the freely available Matlab T-Tide harmonic analysis software33 (http://www.eos.ubc.ca/~rich/#T_Tide). A separate tidal analysis was undertaken for each calendar year with the standard set of 67 tidal constituents. For years with less than 6 months of data coverage, the tide was predicted using harmonic constituents estimated for the nearest year with sufficient data.

Second, we extracted all twice-daily, measured and predicted high water levels at each site, as this is the parameter most relevant to flooding. To do this we used a two-staged turning point approach (described in the Technical Validation section). We then calculated skew surges from the measured and predicted high waters.

Third, we offset the extracted high waters by the rate of mean sea level rise observed at each site. This was in order to directly compare the joint probability of the skew surge and astronomical tide (i.e., extremity) of the high water events throughout the record, independently of mean sea level change. This is because the EA return periods are relative to a baseline level, which corresponds to the average sea level for the year 200827,28. At locations that have undergone a rise in mean sea level over the duration of the record, sea levels before 2008 would have a higher return period, and lower return period thereafter24. For example, the 5th largest high water in the Newlyn record occurred on 29 January 1948. When this is offset by mean sea level rise (mean sea level was 10 cm lower in 1948 compared to 2008), this high water actually has the largest return period at that site24. At each site, we calculated time series of annual mean sea levels, using the high-frequency records from the BODC, supplemented with additional annual mean values obtained from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level’s (PSMSL) archive (Data Citation 4). The PSMSL records are longer at certain sites, compared with the high frequency data available from the BODC archive, and for this reason we make use of this additional dataset where available. We estimated trends in mean sea level using linear regression following the method used by Woodworth et al.34 and Haigh et al.35 (rates are listed in Table 1). For sites where the data length was too short (<20 years) to accurately estimate trends35, we interpolated the trend values from the two surrounding sites. All estimates were checked against results from previous studies of mean sea level changes around the UK34,35, and there is good agreement.

Fourth, we linearly interpolated the EA exceedance probabilities and then estimated the return period of every high water, after offsetting for mean sea level, so that we could directly compare events throughout the record.

Fifth, we stored information associated with the measured high waters that were equal to or greater than the offset 1 in 5-year return level threshold, at each of the 40 sites. We chose this threshold, because: (1) tides are large every 4.4 years due to the lunar perigee cycle36 and we wanted to ensure events arose as consequence of a storm surge and not just a large tide; and (2) it gave us a manageable number of 96 events in stage 2 (for example, selecting the 1 in 1 year threshold would have given more than 350 distinct events and a large proportion of these are unlikely to have caused coastal flooding). For each offset high water that was equal to or greater than the 1 in 5-year return level threshold, we recorded the: (1) date-time of the measured high water; (2) offset return period; (3) measured high water level; (4) predicted high water level; (5) skew surge; and (6) site number (Table 1). Across the 40 sites (for the period 1915 to 2014), 310 high waters reached or exceeded the 1 in 5-year threshold (the top 20 high waters are listed in Table 2, sorted by decreasing the return period). In addition, we also stored information about the top 20 skew surges at each site. This Supplementary Dataset can be used to access storms that generated large skew surges, but which did not lead to coastal flooding because they occurred, for example, on neap tides.

Table 2 The top twenty high waters that exceeded a 1 in 5 year return level. Full size table

Stage 2: Individual storm events

The second stage was to distinguish distinct, extra-tropical storms that produced the 310 high waters that were identified in stage 1, and then to capture the meteorological information about those storms.

To distinguish storms and then assign each of the 310 high waters to one of these, involved a two-stepped procedure. First, we used a simple ‘storm window’ approach. We found that the effect of most storms that cause high sea levels in the UK typically last up to about 3.5 days. We started with the high water of highest return period, and found all of the other high waters that occurred within a window of 1 day and 18 h before or after that high water (i.e., 3.5 days). We then assigned to these the event number 1 (see Table 2). We set all high waters associated with event 1 aside and moved on to the high water with the next highest return period, and so on. This procedure identified 96 distinct events.

Second, we used the meteorological data to determine if the our above-described procedure had correctly linked high waters to distinct storms. To do this we created an interactive interface in Matlab that displayed the 6-hourly progression of mean sea level pressure and wind vectors over the North Atlantic Ocean and Northern Europe around the time of maximum water level. On all but two occasions, our simple procedure correctly identified distinct storms. However, on 9–10 February 1997, the procedure identified one event, whereas, examination of the meteorological conditions showed that there were two distinct storms that crossed the UK in this period in close succession. Hence, we separated the high waters into two distinct events and altered the event numbers accordingly. In contrast, on 11–13 November 1997, our simple procedure identified two events, whereas there was actually only one event, associated with a particularly slow moving storm. Hence, we merged the high waters into one event, and altered the event numbers accordingly. Using this two-stage procedure, we were able to verify that the 310 high waters identified in stage 1, resulted from 96 distinct storms. For most storms, the 1 in 5 year threshold was reached or exceeded at more than one site, and in some cases two high waters exceeded the threshold during the same storm. The time and maximum return period for each of the 96 events is shown in Fig. 3a.

Third, we digitized (using our interactive Matlab interface) the track of each of the 96 storms, from when the low-pressure systems developed, until they dissipated or moved beyond latitude 20°E. Different disciplines capture storm tracks in different ways. Because our focus is upon storm surges generated by the low pressure and the strong winds associated with storms, we captured the storm tracks by selecting the grid point of lowest atmospheric pressure at each 6-hour time step. From the start to the end of the storm, we recorded the 6-hourly: (1) time; (2) latitude; and (3) longitude of the minimum pressure cell; and (4) the minimum mean sea level pressure. For example, the storm track of the second largest event in the database is shown in Fig. 4a.

Stage 3: Coastal flooding

In the third and final stage, we used the dates of the 96 events as a chronological base from which to investigate whether historical documentation exists for a concurrent coastal flood; using a similar approach to that undertaken for the Solent, southern England by Ruocco et al.37. For each event, we searched a variety of sources for evidence of coastal flooding, including: (1) journal papers; (2) publically available reports and newsletters by interested professional parties such as the EA, Meteorological Office, local councils and coastal groups; (3) journalistic reports/news websites; and (4) other online sources (e.g., blogs, social media). In combination, these helped to establish whether coastal flooding occurred or not during the identified high sea level events. Depending on completeness of the information, we also estimated the extent of flooding and associated damages. Zong and Tooley38 and Stevens et al.39 previously complied lists of floods using similar sources, and we greatly benefitted from these studies.

We also compiled a short but systematic commentary for each event. These contain a concise narrative of the meteorological and sea level conditions experienced during the event, and a succinct description of the evidence available in support of coastal flooding, with a brief account of the recorded consequences to people and property. In addition, these contain a graphical representation of the storm track, mean sea level, pressure, and wind fields at the time of maximum high water (e.g., Fig. 4a). They also include figures of the return period and skew surge magnitudes at sites around the UK (e.g., Fig. 4b,c), and a table of the date and time, offset return period, water level, predicted tide, and skew surge for each site where the 1 in 5 year threshold was reached or exceeded (e.g., Table 3) for each event.","Tue, 12 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fsdata.2015.21/MediaObjects/41597_2015_Article_BFsdata201521_Fig1_HTML.jpg,"['waters', 'sites', 'return', 'data', 'level', 'period', 'database', 'water', 'sea', 'used', 'kingdom', 'united', 'high', 'userfriendly', '19152014', 'flooding', 'coastal']",

Fiction set against such a huge sweep of history can often be in danger of recreating the standard school lessons where, as the teacher drones on about how this happened and then this happened in a long recital of forgotten facts, most of the pupils are sent to sleep. It is a testimony to Ghosh's great skills that he can both teach us history and create believable fictional characters.

As the narrative moves from India to China, Ghosh vividly brings to life men and women who cope with the immense impact of the European empires of the 19th century: the undreamt-of opportunities to make money, the challenge to the customs and rituals of ancient societies and the creation of almost unbearable conflicts of loyalties.

Kesri, the farmer's son, who defied his father's wish that he should join the decaying Mughal army to enlist with the army of the new power in India, the British, helps his British masters defeat the Chinese, then realises that he is really a mercenary who can never experience the passion the Chinese feel as they defend their lands. Shireen Modi, the Parsi wife, makes a slow and unexpected realisation – that news her dead husband has sired an illegitimate half-Chinese child does not confine her to a living hell but can be a means of new, more liberating, life. And Zachary, born to a slave and her white master, who passes for white, soon learns that by echoing the arguments of his boss, Burnham, selling opium to the Chinese means bringing them the inestimable values of free trade and liberating them from their tyrannical rulers, he has an opportunity to make the sort of money the penniless American could never have dreamt about.

Zachary also provides Ghosh the chance to take on the mantle of Kipling and explore the adulterous world of the repressed British memsahibs. The setting here is Calcutta not Simla but Ghosh's description of the affair between Zachary and Mrs Burnham, which both wittily exposes the moral hypocrisy involved and provides a gripping denouncement, is a classic piece of writing .

What makes Ghosh's characters come alive all the more is the use of language. English is spiced with Indian words that the English in India incorporated in their everyday usage, Hindi, Bengali, even Chinese. The Indian novelists of the generation before Ghosh, like R K Narayan, would have felt obliged to provide a glossary. Ghosh, occasionally, translates, but often does not, yet pulls off this presentation of the medley of tongues his characters use with great aplomb.

Ghosh's novels have always explored the spin Europeans put on their empire-building that in acquiring other people lands, and subjugating them, they were not just motivated by profit but fulfilling a higher, selfless, moral mission to liberate and uplift these people from their wretched existence. It is part of his immense skill, both as a storyteller and his mastery of history (the novel's epilogue contains a list of books that could do justice to a doctoral thesis) that his narrative never remotely reads like a standard anti-colonial rant.

So far Ghosh's novels have dealt with the period when the European empires reached their zenith. It would be fascinating if he would now turn to the period when they passed into history. This is the one that more often excites British programme-makers and Ghosh could provide a much-needed perspective sorely missing from these narratives.","Thu, 14 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/05/14/03/Calcutta_Rex.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['chinese', 'ghosh', 'flood', 'book', 'novels', 'standard', 'history', 'review', 'amitav', 'white', 'british', 'zachary', 'india', 'ghoshs']",

DENVER –- A May spring storm dumped rain and snow this weekend, causing flooding concerns and road closures across the state.

The South Platte River is expected to be at or above major flood stage by Monday, according to Weld County officials. Flooding in the Evans and southeast Greeley area, which was hard hit in floods last year, was also significant.

This video courtesy of Larry Bases captured some flooding at 2200 49th St in Evans, Colo. near the South Platte River.

Most rivers in northern Colorado experienced minor flooding, including St. Vrain Creek, Boulder Creek, the Big Thompson and Little Thompson rivers and Poudre River.

DENVER — People this week are dealing with the aftermath of flooded basements thanks to all of the rain we got last week and during the weekend.

It was just leaks that caused problems. Some homeowners had to deal with water rising from under their homes.

“They call it hydrostatic pressure because the rain, water and snow melt pushes down and then the ground water that’s under your house rises up,” Edgewater resident Steve Gray said. Gray is cleaning up after his basement flooded as a result of this problem. It turns out the water table is right underneath his house.

St. Vincent De Paul Church on South University Boulevard just north of I-25 also had a flooded basement.

This Indian town with its historic monastery is in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which has long been disputed territory and that China claims as ""South Tibet."" (Annie Gowen/The Washington Post)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had come to his country’s most remote state, an unspoiled place of indigenous tribes and rain forests, to open its first railway station and boast of new development.

But his appearance in February set off a firestorm in China, which still considers much of India’s northeast state of Arunachal Pradesh its own — the Chinese call it “South Tibet.” Officials quickly lodged a protest, sniping that India’s “insistence on arranging activities by leaders in the disputed region” infringes on their “territorial sovereignty.”

As Modi arrived in China on Thursday for a visit with President Xi Jinping, the unresolved matter of Arunachal Pradesh remains a flash point between the world’s most populous countries, which have massed thousands of troops, sophisticated weaponry and aircraft along a 2,520-mile border, long stretches of which remain in dispute.

No shots have been fired there for years, but incursions over the line by troops on both sides have flared into diplomatic incidents and have the potential to escalate, experts say. A Pentagon report to Congress noted this year that despite increasing political and economic relations between India and China, “tensions remain” along the shared border, particularly in disputed areas in Arunachal Pradesh and the Ladakh region in the west, where the two sides “continue to accuse each other of frequent incursions and military build-ups.”

Analysts say Modi has tried to strike a balance by reaching out to China on economic issues such as trade while taking a strong

stance against its expansionism throughout Asia. The two sides have clashed in recent days, with India protesting China’s investment in Pakistan’s Kashmir region and a widely read opinion piece in a Chinese state newspaper accusing Modi of playing “little tricks over border disputes and security” and warning him to stay away from border areas.





And now, the Modi government may prompt ire with wide-ranging plans to shore up the border in Arunachal. Those include a proposal to double the number of border police officers and an ambitious — some say unrealistic — project to build a $6 billion road to run along the steep Himalayas from west to east. Indian authorities are also trying to stem the flood of villagers migrating to big cities from the border by hastening smaller road projects already underway, planning for solar generating stations for those still without electricity and even handing out free bags of rice.

Kiren Rijiju, minister of state for home affairs, who is from Arunachal Pradesh, said that for years the government has neglected the border areas, which has led to migration from smaller villages to larger towns and thinned the border population.

“We’re going to reverse that,” Rijiju said. “Of course, it definitely has strategic ramification. If you don’t develop your border areas, how will your border be secure?”

An exclusive paradise

For most of its 28 years as an Indian state, Arunachal Pradesh — like most of India’s Northeast region — has been relatively cut off from the rest of the country. Sparsely populated, it is an ecological paradise of orchids, bamboo forests and soaring mountain ranges, inhabited by dozens of indigenous tribes.

There is no airport, so visitors arrive on a helicopter flight often canceled for bad weather or to make way for VIPs. Nearly half the population still does not have cellphone service.

Indians and foreign tourists must have special permits to visit. Only about 10,000 foreigners managed to make the trip last year, a fraction of the 7 million people who visited India as a whole. Permission for foreign journalists is even more difficult to obtain. The region’s unique status is part of its charm, locals say.

“There is a romantic aspect of Arunachal that has made it a mystical destination,” said Nalong Mize, an activist and former state adviser.

That’s certainly true for the thousands of pilgrims who flock each year to the Tawang Monastery, a holy site for Tibetan Buddhists. The 17th-century compound of white buildings and fluttering prayer flags sits about 20 miles from the desolate India-

China border.

It was here that the current Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of millions of Tibetan Buddhists, stopped to rest after he fled Tibet on foot over the Himalayas in 1959 because of Chinese repression, seeking refuge in India.

The status of Tawang has exacerbated the long-running dispute between the two countries, experts say. China has never accepted the McMahon boundary line drawn in 1914 that essentially placed Tawang in territory controlled by the British Raj. India, for its part, rejects China’s claim to a slice of the high Tibetan plateau several hundred miles to the west called Aksai Chin.

Modi has promised more development in the next five years than at any time since the state’s creation in 1987, and he urged locals to support projects for hydroelectric power plants. The state’s free-flowing Himalayan rivers hold a third of the country’s hydroelectric potential, but fears by locals about deforestation and land grabs have slowed progress. Only one of the 160 proposed dams is up and running.

Two-thirds of the state’s population of 1.4 million come from indigenous tribes, which maintain their own traditions and, in some cases, are distrustful of outsiders. Even the opening of the state’s first major railway line this year — linking the capital, Itanagar, with New Delhi and Guwahati — was met with ambivalence.

“It’s good, but it’s also bad,” said Yowa Pana, 26, a member of a tribal community with a master’s degree in economics. “It will be easier to reach Delhi and for commercial purposes. But it’s bad, because so many foreigners are going to be coming in. And by ‘foreigners,’ I mean people coming from outside Arunachal Pradesh. We’re concerned they will bring in viruses and criminal activity.”

Yet he conceded that the state has little economic opportunity and that he has had difficulty finding a job. He has thought of becoming a cardamom farmer.

Arunachal’s forbidding territory has made it difficult to complete a network of roads to rival the massive buildup by China on the Tibet side of the border, with smooth highways and miles of railway lines. China far outspends India on overall defense — some $136 billion to $38 billion, according to the Pentagon assessment.

Indian soldiers still have to reach their remote camps by foot or mule, and the road trip to Tawang from the capital takes two days. Locals complain that upgrade work hasn’t been done properly, citing one bridge routinely engulfed in landslides.

India, however, has its 120,000 regular army troops stationed much closer to the border than the estimated 90,000 regular army soldiers in the Tibetan military regions, according to Ashley J. Tellis, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The Indian soldiers also train for mountain warfare more than the Chinese and have deployed greater air power, Tellis said.

‘We didn’t fear them’

Tawang itself has the feel of an occupied city, with green barracks dotting the hillside and soldiers in fatigues mingling with monks in maroon robes in the bustling market square. Near Tawang, at altitudes higher than the clouds, yak herders and villagers gathering firewood fight for space alongside heavy military trucks on winding roads. Many of the residents still remember the short war between the neighboring countries in 1962, when the Chinese briefly occupied the area.

“The Chinese marched from this place — very happily,” recalled a 70-year-old villager, Wangdan, who uses only one name. “But we didn’t fear them.”

But other villagers say they give little thought to the geopolitical dance between the two nuclear-armed nations just miles from their simple homes. They’re far more interested in plans for schools, solar power stations and the new rice giveaway.

Officials hope these new programs will stem the migration from border villages, where the population has dropped 10 to 15 percent in recent years, according to K.C. Dhimole, a technical adviser to the state.

“We are not talking about China,” said Tsering Yangchin, 30, a farmer who cultivates a small plot of fiddlehead ferns and other vegetables. “We are just worrying about our livelihoods.”

Hey there, time traveller!

This article was published 16/5/2015 (2205 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.

In 2007, Huan Hsu, a fine-arts graduate and budding American journalist, went to Shanghai in search of buried treasure and ended up unearthing a wealth of insight into modern China.

The treasure he sought was a collection of Ming Dynasty porcelains his great-great-grandfather buried in a pit in 1938 to hide it from the Japanese army, which had invaded China a year earlier.

Or at least that's what happened according to family lore.

With the treasure buried, Hsu's ancestors fled the family estates in the heart of China's china-producing region in Jiujiang province, about 800 kilometres east of Chengdu, Winnipeg's sino-sister city.

The refugees were elite Chinese -- many well-educated and Christian as a result of attending missionary schools where, Hsu writes, they found Methodism to be a lot like Confucianism. Many made their way to Taiwan and eventually the United States, including Hsu's physics-professor parents. None had gone back to dig for buried treasure.

Hsu was aware of the family history and lore, but writes that he rejected them as he struggled to fit in, to overcome the fact he was ABC (American-born-Chinese) and non-Mormon growing up in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Then, by chance, he stumbled across an exquisite antique porcelain in a Seattle museum. He was enchanted and more or less, just like that, he became a treasure hunter.

But to hunt for treasure he first needed to know a lot more about his family and his heritage.

It is this search for clues that makes The Porcelain Thief a gem for anyone looking to comprehend modern China which, it can be argued, began not with the fall of the last imperial dynasty in 1912, but with the Japanese invasion in 1937.

Hsu's great-great-grandfather's experiences and those of his descendants mirror every important development since then and explain so much of what followed -- the Communist Revolution, the birth of a nation, the injustices of Mao's disasters, Mao's death and the ""opening,"" and the mind-boggling growth of wealth that followed.

The is an improbable story in that so much coincidence conspired to make it a non-fiction page-turner. But as they say about most improbable stories, you can't make this stuff up -- and Hsu didn't have to.

To wit, he had a credible story of buried treasure, a 96-year-old grandmother with a sharp memory, and other relatives who were well-placed to observe (and endure) such atrocities as the Japanese invasion and the Cultural Revolution.

Maybe most seemingly improbable is ""Uncle Richard,"" who gives Hsu a job in Shanghai that makes it possible to obtain a visa and research this book for three years. Uncle Richard can pull strings because he happens to be a billionaire, the ""Taiwanese Tycoon"" who made a fortune in Taiwan and then created a second via his semi-conductor empire in Shanghai after, he claims, God told him that locating to ""the mainland"" would be a great way to spread the Good Word.

Hsu finds ""Buried China,"" but whether he finds buried treasure is for readers to discover.

For Houston-area ob/gyn Dr. Bassem Maximos, delivering babies is all in a day's work.

But there's something special about newborns Mila and Bradley that will stick with him forever, because he almost didn't make it in time to deliver them.

His car got stranded in flooding on the way to the hospital in Tuesday's heavy rains, CBS Houston affiliate KHOU reports.

On another floor, Melissa Vasquez was in labor with her third child. ""Oh my gosh is he gonna get here?"" she worried.

""I was determined to make it,"" Maximos said. He kept calling the nurses and updating them on his progress.

He got there just in time to deliver Vasquez's baby girl, Mila. ""She's here. She's healthy and it's all thanks to him,"" said Vasquez.

Unless the country reforms its stock markets, he warns, it’s only a matter of time until his earlier disaster repeats itself on a larger scale.

In 1995, Leeson was a 28 year-old master-of-the-universe wannabe running a trading desk in Singapore for Barings Bank. When markets turned against him, he tried to hide his losses with unauthorized trades—trades that were enabled by the lax oversight on Singapore’s then-underdeveloped exchanges. Eventually, Leeson’s losses mushroomed to $1.4 billion, shaking world markets and toppling a 223-year-old bank that held an account for Queen Elizabeth and financed the Napoleonic Wars. (Leeson, for his part, ended up in jail, where he wrote a book about his experience called “Rogue Trader."")

Leeson is now warning that another Asian market could be ripe for similar manipulation. “In Singapore it was all about systems not being there to handle the volumes that were coming in,"" Leeson, now 48, told the South China Morning Post this week. In that sense, he suggests, 1990s Singapore bears a close resemblance to today’s China.

As Leeson points out, China’s new stock connect plan—which aims to link trading activity on Shanghai and Hong Kong markets—has caused the country’s hectic trading activity to become even more frantic. Trading volume exploded within days of the plan’s debut last month. It hit a high of $38 billion on 9 April, and has remained roughly twice what average transactions were before its introduction.

What troubles Leeson is that China’s market infrastructure may be getting overwhelmed by an avalanche of buy orders. There’s a mismatch between the flood of data on stock dealing and the ability of regulators to track who is trading what—and how they’re doing it. That opens the door to all sorts of troubling (and potentially illegal) activity.

“You have to keep pace with it and get ahead of the curve and typically [regulators] are behind it,"" said Leeson. “Wherever you’ve got change or a need to consolidate [information], there are opportunities for wrongdoing."" He added that “anybody who is going to do something wrong is not standing still, whether that is cybercrime or anything else within the financial industry.""

Chinese regulators are starting to grasp the problem. On 12 May, one day after Leeson’s warning, securities and futures commission chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing pledged to clamp down on “any unusual share movement."" But capital flows have accelerated so much—with millions of mainlanders having signed up for multiple trading accounts each—that it’s not clear if regulators will know where to start. (President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on international media hasn’t helped matters. Shielded from the scrutiny of journalists, corporate China has become more opaque in its financial dealings.)

Unless Beijing builds a more open and predictable financial system at home, it will always be at risk of exporting its potential for instability. That’s worth keeping in mind as China lobbies companies like MSCI Inc. to include its $7.8 trillion stock market on global indexes.

The indexes should wait until Beijing provides clearer proof of share ownership on its markets, crafts more predictable taxation policies, offers more hedging tools to traders and relaxes curbs on money flowing back into China. As long as China’s financial reforms lag, Beijing shouldn’t be given new channels to affect world markets. If China’s stock markets are included on global indexes, it would allow China’s economic troubles—data yesterday showed investment is now the slowest in 14 years and credit growth is weakening—to spill over to other countries. It would also provide an opportunity for financial fraudsters in China to expand their operations.

China shouldn’t delay in taking bold and credible steps to create a transparent and reliable financial system. Otherwise, as Leeson warns, the country’s rogue stock markets are liable to attract the world’s rogue traders. Bloomberg

JEWI REFUGEE CAMP, Ethiopia, May 15 (UNHCR) - The night after Nyadal Dak arrived in Nip Nip refugee camp from South Sudan with her three children and an orphaned niece, it began to rain. Soon the place was flooded. That was August 2014 and the 26-year-old recalled: ""Every time it rained in Nip Nip, I feared that the place would be flooded again.""

So she was delighted last week when the Ethiopian government, UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration relocated some 2,200 South Sudanese refugees from flood-prone Nip Nip to Jewi Camp in western Ethiopia's Gambella region. In the new camp, the refugees are assured of better humanitarian services and access to education for their children.

A further 48,000 refugees are being moved from the Leitchour camp, located near Nip Nip and also prone to flooding, at a rate of about 1,600 a day. The rainy season recently started and that number is expected to rise to 4,000 a day in a race to complete the operation before the flooding.

""If UNHCR had not relocated us, I was going to walk to this camp with my children,"" Nyadal said outside her tent in Jewi. With the May-October rainy season under way, she said: ""I was living in fear and looking forward to the day I would relocate.""

Like most other refugees here, she also worries about the situation back in South Sudan, which erupted in violence between government and rebel forces in December 2013, forcing more than 200,000 people to flee across the border into the Gambella region.

""The killing was everywhere. My sister and other family members were killed. We saw dead bodies and burnt down towns and villages as we were fleeing,"" said Nyadol, who comes from Upper Nile state. She also became separated from her husband and has no idea even if he is alive.

When she fled to Ethiopia with the four children, ranging in age from three months to six years, it took two weeks to walk to the border. In Nip Nip, they faced the new danger of flooding, which continued until October last year.

Nyadol struggled to find a place to sleep at night, cooking was another problem. ""I had a baby to take care of while constantly keeping my eyes on the other children. I was living in fear of my children drowning in the floodwaters,"" she said.

During the following dry weather, UNHCR and its partners worked to find a site on higher ground and then prepare a camp. When the camp was ready, the most vulnerable refugees such as Nyadol and her family were among the first to be moved.

Angele Djohossou, head of the UNHCR team in Gambella, recalled the difficulties. ""The flooding was a very bad experience for both refugees and humanitarian workers,"" she said. ""We had a refugee influx and we had the flooding. We had two emergencies. We had to use boats and a UNHCR-hired helicopter to provide services as roads were impassable.""

Jewi camp has a capacity to shelter about 50,000 refugees. It will accommodate some 48,000 refugees from Leitchuor, and most of those from Nip Nip, which is now closed.

The International Organization for Migration is providing transport for the move from Leitchuor, which comes at a time when continued fighting in South Sudan is triggering new arrivals into Gambella.

Nyadol is confident she will not have to navigate floodwaters this year in Jewi camp. ""This place will not get flooded. I will stay here until UNHCR tells us that our country is peaceful and it is time to return home."" That could be some time.

22,22,FL-2015-000057-CHN,Flood database goes live - Geographical,https://geographical.co.uk/uk/uk/item/1032-flood-database-goes-live,"A new online database ranks the most severe coastal floods to have occurred in the UK over the last 100 years and reveals last year’s storm surge to have been the largest on record

In an effort to provide greater understanding of flood trends in the UK, the University of Southampton has launched Surgewatch, an online database ranking the most severe coastal storms since 1914. Surgewatch maps 96 storms that generated high sea levels somewhere along the UK coast.

Dr Ivan Haigh, lead author and lecturer in Coastal Oceanography at the University of Southampton tells Geographical,‘we used tide gauge records going back to 1915, with meteorological data to identify times over the last 100 years when very high sea levels had been reached.’ This was used to help track each storm’s progress across the UK. ‘We then used these dates as a reference and spent many thousands of hours reading old reports, books, news articles, blogs and web-sites to estimate the extent and scale of the coastal flooding.’ The data was collated by scientists at the National Oceanography Centre and the British Oceanographic Data Centre.

This screenshot from Surgewatch shows the largest coastal storm on record which occurred on 6 December 2013. (Image: Surgewatch)

The largest flood event occurred in last year’s storm surge, in fact, seven of the 96 events happened during that small period. While it is not difficult to recall the images of colossal waves hitting the coast of southwest England, the reports of thousands of homes without power and streets lined with sandbags, it is thanks to contemporary coastal defences that the impact was not more extreme.

‘While there is evidence that the number of high sea levels are increasing,’ explains Haigh, ‘the actual instances of coastal flooding has reduced slightly, because of improvements in coastal flood defences, forecasting and warning signs.’ The storm of 1953, though smaller than last year’s surge, killed over three hundred people. ‘The fact that the 2013–14 damage was so limited compared to the tragedy of 1953 is thanks to significant government investment in coastal defences, flood forecasting and sea-level monitoring.’","Sat, 16 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://geographical.co.uk/media/k2/items/cache/db4fc567ca6f38f6ec00bf19dfb7c044_S.jpg,"['uk', 'flood', 'live', 'surgewatch', 'surge', 'storms', 'goes', 'database', 'used', 'sea', 'occurred', 'storm', 'coastal']",

In a statement, the Company’s Infrastructure Development General Manager Benson Muriithi, indicated that the two submerged substations located in Nairobi West and Karen were switched off to protect equipment from possible damage and for safety reasons.

“Areas affected by the switch-off include sections of Langata, Hardy Estate, Bogani Road, Magadi Road, Bomas of Kenya area, South C Estate, South B Estate, Nairobi West, Parts of Industrial Area, Madaraka Estate and parts of Upper Hill,” he stated.

Muriithi said the Company evacuated four families of employees living within the Nairobi West substation to safety following the incident.

“The good news is that much of the waters have receded in both substations by this morning; our engineers will later assess and test equipment later before restoring supplies in the course of day,” he said.

In the meantime, hundreds of Nairobi motorists spent the night on highways after floods rendered most roads impassable.

There was heavy traffic snarl ups that went late into the night, with flood waters cutting off most roads.

Areas worst affected included Mombasa Road, South C, Ngong Road, Industrial Area as well as Eastleigh.

Kenyans on social media posted images taken at night when vehicles were stuck in various parts of the city.

So serious was the situation that people were getting home from as late as 3 am.

School buses ferrying children home were also stuck on traffic until late hours, raising serious concerns on the state of Nairobi drainage system and road network.

The Nairobi County government said it has commenced the process of refurbishing the drainage system in the city.","Wed, 13 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/files/2015/05/KENYA-POWER-OVERALLS.jpg,"['waters', 'flood', 'road', 'late', 'heavy', 'substations', 'following', 'nairobi', 'south', 'interrupted', 'estate', 'parts', 'rainfall', 'area', 'west', 'night', 'power']",

The proposed law would add legal weight to a campaign over the past 18 months that has seen authorities forcibly remove at least 470 crosses and destroy more than 35 churches, often following violent confrontations with local Christians.

Last week, authorities asked for feedback on draft rules claiming to “protect freedom of religious belief” including a ban on crosses being affixed to the tops of churches as well as restrictions on mosques, and Buddhist and Daoist temples.

“It is quite standard around the world that the cross is placed on the rooftop. How can we just fix it on the façade? It’s difficult for us to accept,” said an underground Catholic priest in Wenzhou who asked not to be named for security reasons.

“Under such circumstances, we may have to build our churches in the Chinese temple style in the future,” he added.

The 36-page directive also states that crosses must be painted in colors to blend in with church façades, and designed with a height-to-width ratio of one to 0.618 at Catholic churches and three to two on Protestant churches.

A Protestant catechist in Wenzhou told ucanews.com the new measures showed the Communist Party was now planning to directly interfere in the design of churches.

Other provisions state that kitchens and bathrooms must primarily use solar power or other renewable energy, a costly requirement that has not been imposed on other organizations in China.

“It is simply ridiculous,” said the catechist, who also asked not to be named. “The authorities should control the smog first before talking to the Church about environmental protection.”

Chongyi Church, the largest Protestant church in Zhejiang’s provincial capital Hangzhou, issued an angry statement calling for the government’s proposals to be scrapped.

The draft legislation “blasphemes the foundational belief of Christianity” and violates China’s constitution in respect to freedom of religious belief, it said.

“[It is] discriminatory with more unreasonable requirements on the Catholic and Protestant Churches,” the statement added.","Thu, 14 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ucanews.com/uploads/2015/05/1431590666.jpg,"['restrictions', 'hit', 'protestant', 'authorities', 'catholics', 'church', 'chinas', 'draft', 'churches', 'belief', 'wenzhou', 'protestants', 'cross', 'catholic', 'asked', 'crosses']",

These include massive dams, mines, wells and farms, alongside quarries, irrigation systems and flood control plains. At Von Lintel Gallery, the Canadian photographer, who has traveled the globe to make his stunning images, invites visitors to see humanity as a species—not as unique individuals who stand out from the crowd, but as indistinguishable, and very small, components of a much larger whole—like ants in a colony.

That’s a fascinating perspective, partly because it flies in the face of the way we usually look at art—as an embodiment of the singular genius of singular geniuses—and partly because it gets us to look at the big picture: our global economy in which some fundamental resources—like water, air and food—may not be able to sustain the rate at which humans have been reproducing. What that means for life as we know it is the subject of Burtynsky’s panoramic landscapes.

Beauty and ugliness, nature and industry, exist cheek-by-jowl in his crystal-clear pictures. Some are hellish, their glistening lakes of radioactive oil bleeding from the Earth like a toxic wound that won’t heal. Others are gorgeous, their snow-capped peaks and steep ravines so breathtakingly vast that they make human beings seem inconsequential.

A drone’s-eye view of a dam under construction on the Yangtze River presents an entirely manmade landscape that looks utterly alien, like a concrete spaceship so far out in the galaxy that it’s impossible to tell up from down, left from right, right from wrong. Shot from helicopters, two views of terraced mountainsides, where Chinese farmers grow rice, show what daily labor adds up to when it’s done over centuries.

Above all else, Burtynsky’s pictures are humbling. Sober and sensible, they make it clear just how little individuals can do on our own while suggesting that as a group we have a lot to learn from ants.

REUTERS/Stringer

ROME (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The chances of shock food price rises in import-dependent states are rising as the world’s population grows and nations become more reliant on global markets, researchers said in a study published on Tuesday.

Countries dependent on food imports, and states where rising populations are putting pressure on scarce land and water resources, are the most susceptible to sudden jumps in food prices, the author of the University of Virginia study said.

“The world’s food system is less resilient because of globalization,” Paolo D’Odorico, an environmental sciences professor who co-wrote the study, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

A flood, drought or political unrest in one country can affect the food security of another elsewhere in the world, he said, citing grain export bans imposed by Russia in 2010 because of a drought and the need to protect domestic consumers.

“Increasing reliance on local food, whenever possible, is a good approach,” D’Odorico said.

Import-dependent states in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are particularly vulnerable to shocks in other regions, he said.

The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analyzed data for 140 countries on demographics, food production, consumption and trade flows from 1986 to 2011.

Global food prices are at their lowest in more than four years, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization reported in March.

But the world’s growing population and increased trade dependency make it almost certain there will be further food price shocks, D’Odorico said, though he declined to say when this might happen next.","Tue, 12 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150512&t=2&i=1047779771&r=LYNXMPEB4B0VG&w=800,"['shocks', 'states', 'saidthe', 'study', 'worlds', 'trade', 'thomson', 'price', 'trfn', 'researchers', 'worsens', 'sciences', 'food', 'dodorico', 'importers', 'globalization']",

When Capital FM News arrived in Nairobi West, residents were still busy draining water out of their houses and making every effort to salvage what they could.

Piles of clothes, shoes and among others bedding were piled up in huge paper bags some for washing others for disposal.

Kitchen utensils, carpets and other household stuff littered in dirty water were piled outside.

People were busy cleaning, sweeping and sorting out what could be salvaged after dirty water flooded their houses.

Businessmen who run shops along the same street were also counting huge losses of losing their property and machines and also loss of customers for the days they had closed their shops.

“The water came inside my house, it had no other space to go out. I have closed my shop, I can’t do any business.

What am I going to eat? My food is completely destroyed,” Shah a businessmen whose house was also flooded vented.

“We cannot even switch on any power, we have no water. We have been talking to these people (city authorities) they are not even looking at us,” he decried.

Shah’s house was empty, all the furniture which was soaked in water had been taken out. The bedrooms, the kitchen and the stores were all empty.

They were all paraded outside his compound as people helped him to sweep the house.

A neighbour next door was equally in shock. She had lost everything including her stationery. She was just happy after one of the people draining water out of her compound handed some photos to her.

Shah’s story was similar to Samuel Kioko.

“The rains came and there was a flood in my shop. My compressor machine worth Sh60, 000 broke down and my other machines were swept away, I am just trying to be strong,” Samuel Kioko narrated.

Just outside the estate, there was an earth mover trying to dig up a drainage pipe.

The pipe was fully covered with soil and stacked with rubbish and mud.

From the look of it, the drainage pipe stopped working some years back.

Near the Nairobi West South C junction were several drainage trenches which were all completely blocked and flooded with stagnant water.

The trenches are supposed to drain water to a stream in Nairobi West.

A security guard in Nairobi West, Peter Nthuku recalled the night of Tuesday when strong floods filled the stream.

According to him, the intensity of the floods was too strong and also in high volume making it impossible for water to flow under the bridge.

“What I realised is that the water was more and its force was stronger than the bridge. The bridge is small, and the amount of water flowing could not fit under the bridge, it spilled over the bridge, it was sweeping big tree branches and all types of waste which were blocking smaller trenches that it could have drained through,” Nthuku explained.

Plastic bags of all colours, blankets, plastics, tree branches and all manner of rubbish hang slackly on a wire fence along the stream.

He said the best solution to resolve flooding in the region is for the county government to construct a high bridge and open the drainage pipes but also make them bigger so that huge amounts of water can pass through.

He also said a wire mesh should be installed along the stream to sieve rubbish that blocks passage of water.

Shah explained that all the water supposed to go through the bridge hit a wall built on the stream in Nairobi West and then found its way back to their houses and other areas in South C.

The residents and businessmen in the area appealed to the government to speedily replaced the broken drainage pipes and also expand them.

City Council workers and National Youth Service were also busy unclogging drainage systems in Kilimani and South C.

However, critics argue that it is little more than a project designed by Germans architects for Chinese investors

This month, Mongolia’s parliament will vote on the feasibility of the construction of a new cultural and religious capital – ‘Maidar’ – out in the steppe 30km from Ulaanbaatar. What started as humble drawings for a model eco-town for 20,000 people has been redesigned as a city for 300,000 in light of a population crisis in the nearby capital city. However, the building of Maidar might be a talking point for everyone except Mongolians.

Maidar has been planned by the German architect company RSAA in collaboration with the Grand Maitreya Foundation and will be built to German environmental standards. With wind and solar farms included in the plans, there are hopes that it will become a beacon of sustainability.

The city will be planned from the centre working outwards in a series of commissioned phases. First, the central Maitreya statue and Buddha complex will be built, followed by concentric hubs for housing, offices, schools, healthcare and tourism. These hubs are intended to become local communities in keeping with the concept that daily services should be able to be reached by a maximum of a 400m walk. Transport will prioritise ‘urban arteries’ for pedestrians, cyclists and small electric buses.

Construction is already underway for the 54m Maidar Buddha Statue and stupa which will mark the centre of the city. (Image: Maidar City)

The project claims that Maidar will be sensitive to the surrounding mountain area ‘keeping the character of the landscape alive and making it visible from each construction site’. Rainwater will be channelled from the surrounding hills into an independent water system. The final stage of the project is a ‘green triangle’ tree-planting scheme which will extend 90 degrees in each direction from the city centre and is intended to slow the process of desertification.

For such a grand and oasis-like project, the main issue is money. Chief architect, Stephen Schmitz, admits that funds are coming from eager Chinese investors who will buy off portions of the project. Dr Troy Sternberg, a landscape and Gobi desert expert at the University of Oxford, describes the designs as ‘more like a dream project. Mongolians can't explain the realities of it’. He also contends that most of the nomads that have moved into Ulaanbaatar won’t be able to afford the new apartments drawn up for Maidar, and that few Mongolian companies have the funds to invest in their construction.

‘Further to that, the physical logistics would not work,’ says Sternberg. ‘The area only gets 200mm of rainwater per year so there is not much for an independent water system to catch.’ Meanwhile, he thinks that a green triangle might not be a realistic use of resources: ‘Preventing desertification is still a contentious issue. If developers really wanted a simple way to slow desertification, they would build more shallow wells to disperse the animal herds. That way, the grasslands nearer the Gobi wouldn't be trampled away by too much livestock around too few water sources.’","Wed, 13 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://geographical.co.uk/media/k2/items/cache/c5f6baee01bcaad1c58a783afd54c7cc_S.jpg,"['smart', 'surrounding', 'system', 'mongolian', 'way', 'ulaanbaatar', 'city', 'project', 'maidar', 'water', 'centre', 'triangle', 'steppe']", 
38,38,FL-2015-000057-CHN,"Diplomats, business people flood Cuba amid warmer US ties - Jamaica Gleaner",https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/caribbean/20150510/diplomats-business-people-flood-cuba-amid-warmer-us-ties,"HAVANA (AP) — Tourists in shorts and sandals aren't the only foreigners flooding Havana these days.

Top diplomats from Japan, the European Union, Italy, the Netherlands and Russia have visited the island in recent months in bids to stake out or maintain ties with an island that suddenly looks like a brighter economic prospect amid warming U.S.-Cuba relations.

On Sunday night, Francois Hollande becomes the first French president to ever visit communist Cuba, bringing along five ministers and two dozen business people, including the heads of Pernod-Ricard, Cuba's partner in exporting Havana Club rum, and grain exporter Soufflet.

""It's impossible to deny that diplomatic detente between Washington and Havana has accelerated the process of normalization between Cuba and Europe,"" said Salim Lamrani, a Cuba expert at France's University of La Reunion.

Cuba was once accustomed primarily to visits from leftist Latin American partners and smaller allies in Africa and the Caribbean.

Now, virtually all of the visiting diplomatic delegations are accompanied by high-powered business people interested in Cuba's push to draw more than $8 billion in new foreign investment as part of a broader, gradual economic liberalization. The delegations are also working to ensure that Cuba doesn't forget its old friends in what eventually could be a new era of increased business with the United States.

""We've never stopped believing in and betting on Cuba,"" said Jean-Francois Lepy, the commercial director of Soufflet, which has been in Cuba for 30 years. Sixty French firms have active operations on the island.

Spain, the Netherlands, Italy and France are Cuba's biggest trading partners within the European Union, which is the island's second-largest economic partner with a combined $4.65 billion a year in trade in food, machinery and other goods. Top partner Venezuela accounts for $7 billion, mostly highly subsidized oil.

Like virtually all European business people who have established a foothold in Cuba despite its labyrinthine bureaucracy and unpredictable business environment, Lepy said the U.S.-Cuba warming represents ""a risk and a challenge"" for his business.

That will be even more so if agricultural interests and other U.S. businesses successfully push Congress to lift the half-century trade embargo on the Caribbean country.

""If the embargo is lifted, the U.S. market, so much closer to Cuba, will be an important competitor for us and our exports to Cuba might go down,"" Lepy said.

As a backup plan, his firm is also looking at ways to export processing technology and know-how to Cuba instead of just grain, he said.

Many foreign business people see the U.S. less as a competitor than as a potential source of jet-fueled future growth for the businesses they have established, or hope to establish, in Cuba.

Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida became the highest-level Japanese official to visit Cuba this month when he brought several dozen representatives of his country's automotive, finance, health and tourism industries on a trip aimed at increasing business.

A British business delegation led last month by Lord Hutton of Furness, head of Britain's non-governmental Cuba Initiative, announced $400 million in new agriculture, energy, tourism and other projects. Cuban state media reported Friday that the Ministry of Tourism had just signed a deal with China to build a golf course east of Havana.

A French presidential spokesman told reporters this week that while his government expected no immediate economic benefits from the highest-level European visit since the Dec. 17 announcement of detente, ""it's important to be the first.""

""It would be absurd to throw oneself into a race with the United States; the ties that we have aren't the same, they're not even the same scale,"" the French spokesman said on customary condition of anonymity.","Sun, 10 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/all/themes/gleaner/favicon.ico,"['flood', 'visit', 'tourism', 'warmer', 'partner', 'european', 'economic', 'lepy', 'amid', 'cuba', 'havana', 'business', 'french', 'diplomats', 'ties']",

LAST year, the Vrátna dolina valley suffered a massive flood that brought a rock fall and devastation to the entrance road, bridges and the lower terminal station of the cableway to the Chleb mountain.

Font size: A - | A +

“The avalanche of rocks that started moving due to torrential rain is called mura – and we know from history that the biggest mura so far was in Štefanová in 1848,” Zuzana Harachová, tourism manager of Terchová, said. Terchová is the municipality located in Vrátna. “Then, a mura of 25,000 cubic metres was loosened from Kreminná Valley, destroying the village and causing 14 deaths,” she added for the Sme daily.

Last year’s flood and rock fall was not that devastating, she explained, and thanks to emergency aid of all authorities – state, regional, district and municipal – they managed to renew Vrátna. The process was completed on December 26, 2014, when the cableway was opened again.

Several renovations and repairs were carried out, Harachová said, including those of bridges and the tourist path leading to the symbolic cemetery of people killed in the mountains. The route from Starý dvor to Poludňový Grúň was renewed, too, as was the Jánošíkové diery site. The ultimate goal is safety of the roads and paths for all hikers and skiers, in summer as well as in winter.

After a good winter season – thanks to abundant snow – the summer season is eagerly expected, with bookings already taking place.

“After the events of 2014, we expect a high visitor rate for summer, also thanks to popular events,” Harachová said, adding that paradoxically, the flood newscast of last year reminded people of Terchová and Vrátna, making them curious how they look now, after the disaster and the renovation. “Last year’s flood helped remind people of our region,” the tourism manager concluded.

Some areas of Wellington saw the heaviest hourly rainfall in more than 50 years during the deluge on Thursday, data from the regional council shows.

The record rainfall resulted in widespread flooding and one death.

Rain gauges at Battle Hill, MacKay's Crossing, and Tawa Pool recorded more rain than is usually expected during the entire month of May.

Since the rainfall occurred in narrow bands or in thunderstorms, some of the heaviest rainfall was very localised.

* Mackay's Crossing received 145mm in 24 hours

* Battle Hill received 144mm in 24 hours

* Waikanae received 102mm in 24 hours

* Avalon received 42mm in just one hour

* Te Hapua road received 27mm in just one hour



The downpour heavily affected the region's waterways, but no rivers or streams managed by the Regional Council broke their stopbanks. Porirua Stream peaked at 66 cubic metres a second, an amount not seen since 1980.

Flood protection systems for the Waikanae and Hutt rivers were extensively upgraded recently. They are now expected to stop flooding in everything below a 1-in-100 year flood.

Greater Wellington Regional Council's flood protection manager, Graeme Campbell, said it was an investment worth making.

""Further work to a higher standard is planned for the lower Hutt River partly in anticipation of higher and more volatile climate-change related rainfall,"" he said.

The council maintains 58 rainfall-monitoring sites across the region, and 62 river-monitoring sites. The equipment allows them to monitor conditions in real time.

Wilderness areas were also damaged. The rainfall knocked bridges and damaged roads in Belmont Regional Park, closing many popular walking routes.

The move, announced by the Chinese Defence Ministry today, is likely to further put off Western leaders from attending the parade in September.

China has been coy about which countries it plans to invite to the parade, but says it will likely invite representatives from the Western Allies who fought with China during the war.

President Xi Jinping could be left standing on the stage with few top Western officials, however, diplomats have said, due to the concerns of Western governments over a range of issues, including the expected presence of Russian President Putin.

Xi attended a parade in Moscow on Saturday to mark 70 years since the end of the war in Europe. Putin used the occasion to display the country's formidable armaments in a show of strength directed at the West.

Thousands of troops marched across the historic cobblestones with formidable-looking new high-tech armour, while T-14 Armata tanks were on show for the first time.

A Defence Ministry statement said Fan Changlong, deputy chairman of China's powerful Central Military Commission, told Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu that China 'warmly welcomes Russian military leaders and army formations' to take part in the September events in Beijing.

Xi's visit to Russia and appearance at the Moscow commemorations 'pushed the China-Russia all-round strategic partnership relationship to a new level', Fan added, according to the statement.

The Beijing parade, which will likely see troops marching through Tiananmen Square, will be Xi's first since he took over as Communist Party leader and military chief in late 2012 and as state president in early 2013.

Sino-Japan relations have long been poisoned by what China sees as Japan's failure to atone for its occupation of parts of the country before and during the war, and Beijing rarely misses an opportunity to remind its people and the world of this.

Last month, U.S. President Barack Obama's top Asia adviser, Evan Medeiros, said that he had questions about whether a large military parade would really send a signal of reconciliation or promote healing, drawing a rebuke from China.

National police chief Somyot Pumpunmuang has proposed setting up official camps to shelter Rohingya migrants in a bid to regulate the influx of migrants and to deal decisively with human trafficking.

His proposal comes amid the massive crackdown on trafficking networks in Songkhla and Satun. Hundreds of trafficked migrants have been discovered by authorities.

As of yesterday (May 11), a total of 250 migrants had been rescued in jungles along the Khao Kaew mountain range in Sadao, Hat Yai and Rattaphum districts of Songkhla. A large number of smuggled Rohingya are also being held at detention centres under the authority of the immigration police.

According to Pol Gen Somyot, the Thai government's efforts to repatriate Rohingya migrants are currently failing.

As a result, fresh measures are necessary to address the issue he describes as a national problem.

Pol Gen Somyot said the proposed shelters will allow the government to handle the problem in a systematic manner. However, he admitted the idea might attract more Rohingya migrants to Thailand.

The national police chief's move has been welcomed by human rights defenders but the government and national security authorities have distanced themselves from it.

Human rights lawyer Surapong Kongchantuk, from the Lawyers Council of Thailand, said the proposed shelters would be the first step by the government to tackle the Rohingya migrant problem in a systematic manner.

If refugee camps are set up, these migrants will be documented and provided with proper assistance, he said. Some of them are victims of human trafficking and they may want to be repatriated, while some are asylum seekers who may require assistance from international aid organisations.

However, Mr Surapong noted that the proposed shelters should be temporary and should not be run as ""refugee camps"" which would lead to more complications.

National Security Council (NSC) secretary-general, Anusit Khunakorn, said the migration problem is a delicate issue and the government has to find a balance between national security and humanitarian assistance. The migration of foreign nationals is already a pressing issue for Thai authorities and setting up shelters may trigger waves of migrants which will have adverse effects on several aspects including national security, he said.

Mr Anusit insisted the Rohingya migration problem is not the burden of one country, but the international community's responsibility.

Deputy government spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd said the issue concerns national security and humanitarian reasons and it needs to be considered thoroughly. The country has several refugee shelters and detention centres and they are overcrowded.

He also stressed that Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has started to address the Rohingya migrant problem by seeking support and cooperation from the international community.

Meanwhile, police yesterday issued a warrant for the arrest of the 50th suspect in the Rohingya trafficking case in the lower South. The suspect, identified as Patchuban ""Ko Tong"" Angchotipan, former chairman of Satun provincial administration organistion, has close ties with Muang Padang Besar mayor Banjong Pongpol who surrendered to police to face suspected human trafficking charges last week.

Satun police and officials from the Anti-Money Laundering Office searched Mr Patchuban's home in Muang district and more than a dozen locations linked to him amid rumours that he has fled the country to Langkawi, Malaysia.

In a related development, deputy national police chief Pol Gen Ake Angsananont has recommended the transfer of more than 10 policemen mainly in Satun and Songkhla to inactive posts. On Sunday (May 10), Pol Gen Somyot signed a transfer order for 14 police officers.

Pol Gen Ake said Suwan ""Ko Nui"" Saenthong, one of the suspects in a trafficking network in Ranong, surrendered to police to face trafficking charges.

Of the 50 suspects, 17 are in police custody and 33 remain at large.

""Iron"" Mike Tyson, who is reinventing himself as an actor following his successful cameos in The Hangover trilogy, was nursing a fractured finger in Shanghai on Friday courtesy of some heavy sparring with lead star Donnie Yen on the set of Ip Man 3.

Boxing fans who felt shortchanged by the May 2 ""super fight"" between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao can look forward to February 2016, when the latest chapter in the story of Ip Man, Bruce Lee's teacher, gets its Chinese mainland theatrical release.

The $36 million action film, which will focus more on the student-master relationship between Lee and Ip, may be the first of the trilogy to hit the silver screen in North America in a big way, especially with Tyson involved. The first two had an extremely limited release in that market.

""This is definitely going to be an exciting fight,"" said Tyson, 48, who was also seen in Scary Movie 5 and will appear in Meet the Blacks, now in postproduction. ""Me and him, it's a great clash, a great kamikaze kind of explosion.

""Most trilogies are never better than the first part. This one is going to step up. A lot of drama, more realistic. It's real. Life on life's terms,"" he told China Daily.

Tyson gave the interview while playing the video game Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare at his hotel suite in Shanghai's Songjiang district. He said he plays a property developer who is in league with the chief of police.

""I'm Frank. Not a decent guy, but a shady business guy. Greedy. I'm a good villain — a rogue with a kind heart. I am bad, but I've got good qualities,"" said Tyson, who is spending 10 days filming in the city. It is his fourth trip to China.

""I love being the bad guy,"" added the man known for his obliteration of opponents in the ring in the 1980s, as he broke into a villainous laugh. Tyson famously KO'd Michael Spinks in 91 seconds while at the height of his powers.

In 1986 he became the youngest-ever undisputed heavyweight champion of the world at the age of 20 years, four months and 22 days.

He earned a reported $300 million to $400 million during his career, declared bankruptcy in 2003, and is now said to be worth around $1 million.

""When I did The Hangover, it was such a success … (I decided) this is what I'm going to do now,"" he said of acting. ""This is my bread and butter.""

Reports say Ip Man 3 will be released in 3-D and feature a computer-generated Bruce Lee, as no convincing actor could be found to portray the kung fu icon. All filming is being done on location in Shanghai and at Hengdian World Studios in Zhejiang province, dubbed ""Chinawood"".

Tyson joins a flood of Western and Asian stars rushing to join Chinese productions. Adrien Brody and John Cusack starred in Jackie Chan's Dragon Blade this year, the most expensive movie made on the mainland.

Tyson was approached by Shi Jianxiang, one of the main investors, in Los Angeles during the Oscars season. Shi is the CEO of Shanghai Kuailu Investment Group.

""After talking with Tyson, I also found him warm and loyal to friends. That's why we swore to be brothers,"" Shi said.

""Chinese culture can provide such great raw ingredients, but we lack techniques and professionalism of production,"" Shi said. ""By learning from Hollywood, we can play a greater role on the world stage and make our voices heard.""","Sat, 16 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/entertainment/attachement/jpg/site1/20150515/180373d28c1016c07bb54d.jpg,"['million', 'explosive', 'great', 'tyson', 'ip', 'fans', 'guy', 'shanghai', 'promises', 'fight', 'world', 'man', 'shi']",

The U.S. Coast Guard has issued a safety alert after an incident where an anchor slipped and punctured a ship’s hull.

The cargo ship was underway in 15 foot seas when the forepeak flood alarms activated. The crew investigated and discovered the starboard anchor had slipped 10-15 links, causing it to strike and puncture the hull. As a result, seawater flooded the bow thruster and emergency fire pump compartment.

The casualty resulted in excess of $1 million in vessel damage and a month’s lost revenues while the vessel was out of service affecting repairs. During the repair period, it was discovered that the anchor windlass brake pad had worn down to 2-3mm thickness. With only this amount of pad the fully applied brake could not achieve its designed holding power. The crew should have recognized the excessive wear to the brake pads and required replacement, says the safety alert.

It was also discovered that the involved anchor had dissimilar specifications to the original anchor it had replaced. As a result, the replacement anchor’s relative position in the hawse pipe was not the same because of its different shank length and connecting linkages. The size difference prevented the riding pawl from properly engaging the anchor chain.

As an added safety device, a wire sling had been used to secure the anchor. The wire sling was threaded through a chain link and secured to the vessel with a pelican hook. When the sling broke and the brake failed, the anchor’s weight and ship’s movement then caused it to drop before the riding pawl could properly engaged. The sling failure was likely caused by the corrosion of the inner wire strands. The inner wire strands were exposed to the elements because of the sharp bend in the wire created by being fed through the chain link and secured by a pelican hook.

The wire sling was inspected regularly. However, those performing the inspections were not instructed on how to examine and determine its serviceability.

The safety alert reminds vessel operators and company technical managers of the importance of proper ship’s anchor use, stowage and maintenance. Anchor windlass brakes, riding pawls, and devil’s claws must be used as designed and periodically maintained to ensure effectiveness and safety.

It’s critical that proper supervision and inspection be conducted during and after anchoring, retrieving and storage evolutions, and maintenance activities. When installing a replacement anchor, it must meet the vessel’s technical specifications and fit correctly when housed.

The full safety alert is available here.","Tue, 12 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Machinery/Cropped/anchor%2016x9.jpg,"['alert', 'anchor', 'hull', 'wire', 'vessel', 'brake', 'ships', 'replacement', 'riding', 'punctured', 'sling', 'safety']",

Just a few days ago, on Tuesday, May 12, an Amtrak passenger train derailed in Philadelphia, killing seven and injuring over 200.

The train was traveling twice the speed limit, though investigators don’t know yet if excessive speed was the sole cause of the crash, or if track conditions and mechanical issues in the train contributed to the wreck.

This wasn’t the first train-related disaster to occur in Philadelphia, though. On September 6, 1943, a train traveling from Washington D.C. to New York city crashed when an axle overheated and snapped, causing eight of the train’s 16 cars to derail, and killing 50 people.

The 1943 crash was only half as fatal as some of the United States’ worst train disasters, however. Here are the five most fatal train wrecks in United States history.

5. Ashtabula River Railroad Disaster

This passenger train crash was caused by the failure of a bridge on December 29, 1876 not even a quarter mile from the train station in Ashtabula, Ohio. Plunging into the river below, cars were ignited by their heating stoves, with 92 passengers dying from various causes.

It turned out that the bridge, inadequately designed and built by the railroad company, was faulty. As a result of this crash, a federal system was set up to formally investigate crashes resulting in death and injury to passengers.

4. Malbone Street Wreck

Occurring on November 1, 1918, this crash resulted from a train taking a curve in a tunnel with a speed limit of six miles per hour at a speed of 30 to 40 MPH. Devastating half of the train’s cars and causing surprisingly minor damage to the others, the crash left at least 93 dead, with the train’s inexperienced operator making it out uninjured.

3. Great Wellington Train Disaster

This March 1, 1910 disaster was not caused by operator error or any sort of mechanical failure, but rather, an avalanche hitting multiple trains at around 1:00 a.m., when most passengers and crew-members were asleep. The trains were thrown 150 feet downhill into a valley, killing a total of 96 people.

2. Eden Train Wreck

Another incident caused by natural phenomena, a flash flood wave swept away half of a train en route to St. Louis, Missouri on August 7, 1904, dragging 97 passengers and crew-members to their deaths just eight miles north of Pueblo, Colorado.

1. Great Train Wreck of 1918

The most deadly train-related catastrophe to ever occur in the United States happened right here in redOrbit’s home of Nashville, Tennessee on July 9, 1918, when two trains, one leaving Nashville for Memphis and another arriving in Nashville from Memphis, collided head-on. One hundred and one passengers died in the incident. Investigators attributed the accident to “serious errors” made by crew-members aboard the train departing Nashville and by tower operators for failing to account for the fact that there was another train in the way. The feature image at the top of the story is from this wreck.

The Gila River begins in New Mexico before flowing into Arizona. Click image to enlarge.

The Bureau of Reclamation, the federal government’s chief dam-building agency, found that costs significantly exceed benefits for all 11 of the diversion and reservoir options that it analyzed. These factors and more have led many in the state to question the wisdom of a project whose cost to build and operate, which depends on the option selected, could range from $US 62 million up to $US 775 million.

“The major problem is that the project is not feasible,” Norm Gaume, one of the strongest critics, told Circle of Blue. Gaume is a former director of the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission, the state agency that is evaluating the diversion.

“There’s not much water there,” Gaume added. “The project is extremely exposed to climate change impacts. The cost is just over the top, and the environmental impacts are extreme. It’s an egregious proposal.”

Nonetheless, the ISC voted last November to continue pursuing the project.

“It would be irresponsible for the ISC to ignore the annual average of 14,000 acre-feet of additional water available to New Mexico in the 2004 Arizona Water Settlements Act,” wrote spokeswoman Lela Hunt in a statement to Circle of Blue. ISC commissioners declined a request for an interview.

The office of Anthony Gutierrez is bright white and appropriately cluttered for the planning director of Grant County. Gutierrez is also the chairman of the Gila-San Francisco Water Commission, a forum for regional water decisions. He spoke with Circle of Blue in March, four months after the ISC’s November vote.

“We want to keep New Mexico’s water in New Mexico as best we can,” Gutierrez said. “I hate to think of water as a commodity but our social well-being has made it that. It’s more valuable than gold or oil to us.”

Anthony Gutierrez, chairman of the Gila-San Francisco Water Commission, says that the region should use the Gila River water granted by Congress. Click image to enlarge.

What the nine ISC commissioners approved last fall was a formal declaration of their intent to divert water from the Gila. The declaration was required under the Arizona Water Settlements Act (AWSA) by the end of 2014. By making the declaration, the state has a year to form a governing body for the diversion, officially called the New Mexico Unit of the Central Arizona Project, the federal canal that moves the Colorado River through the heart of Arizona. The Gila-San Francisco commission wants to be in charge of the New Mexico Unit, meaning it will be responsible for financing and operating a large project for a four-county region that is home to just 62,000 people.

The AWSA is a tangled piece of legislation. Its primary purpose was to settle Native American water rights in Arizona. To garner support from the New Mexico delegation, water from the Gila was added to the package and federal dollars sweetened the deal. The act provided New Mexico with $US 66 million to spend on any water supply project in the four-county area. Because it was pegged to inflation, the amount available has grown to $US 90 million. An additional tranche of money, up to $US 62 million, is earmarked for the capital cost of building a diversion.

An agreement ratified as part of the AWSA, called the Consumptive Use and Forbearance Agreement, sets hydrological limits on when water can be removed from the river. Because the Gila’s flow has sharp peaks and deep valleys, in some years no water would have been diverted, according to the Nature Conservancy study. By mid-century, average river discharge is expected to decrease by 6 percent, based on five climate models.

Effects in Arizona of a Gila Diversion The Gila River diversion, if built, will become part of the Central Arizona Project, the federal canal that moves Colorado River water to Phoenix and Tucson as well as farm districts and Indian tribes. For every acre-foot (326,000 gallons) of water withdrawn from the Gila, New Mexico will be required to pay for an equivalent amount of water to be delivered to the Gila River Indian Community, southeast of Phoenix. The 2015 rate, subjected to annual increases, is $US 179 per acre-foot. This exchange will have a marginal effect on the operations of the Central Arizona Project, said Tom McCann, deputy general manager. Arizona will have less surplus Colorado River water, which it now uses to recharge aquifers. New Mexico’s Gila diversion will not be reduced, McCann said, if the lower Colorado River Basin declares a shortage, which could occur as soon as next year.

That study also concluded that a diversion would harm the floodplain by reducing groundwater recharge and increasing land erosion during the Gila’s occasional fierce floods. Drawing more water from the river, especially during the spring snowmelt, will cut off fish habitat and reduce spawning grounds for two endangered species, the loach minnow and spikedace.

Gutierrez is sympathetic to claims of environmental damage, but he says they should not be a deterrent.

“I live on the river,” Gutierrez said, referring to his home in the Gila Valley. “I spent my childhood on the river. I want to preserve the resource. But the conservationists carry their goals too far. Plus, I’m a planner. I can see that we already have water issues. Drought is affecting the water supply.”

The AWSA, he asserted, is a tantalizing proposition: “Here we have a congressional act to keep water in New Mexico. I don’t see why we wouldn’t. It might be our last opportunity.”

Gutierrez says this often: I’m a planner. His background is engineering and infrastructure development. All money spent by Grant County for capital projects — roads, buildings, water supply — comes through his office.

Explaining Desire for Diversion

In a 90-minute conservation it is clear that the commission’s plan for the Gila diversion, at this point, is more a desire for water than a coherent blueprint. Mainly this is because no single project from the dozens of combinations of diversion points and reservoir locations has emerged as a winner. A final cost will not be known until environmental reviews are completed by 2019.The commission is basing its estimates on a $US 350 million project, Gutierrez said.

But Gutierrez does not believe that the unit cost for water — what a city or a farmer will pay for an acre-foot — is required information. He believes that contracts for the water before construction begins are unnecessary as well. “There’s already a need,” he said. “Once the water is available people will use it.”

Is this Field of Dreams assumption — that if the project is built, someone will pay for the water — sufficient for the commission to continue pushing for construction?

“That assumption is enough for me,” replied Gutierrez, who talks about investing the AWSA money and using the returns to help finance the project. “It may not be enough for the environmental community.”

Conservation Alternatives for AWSA Funds

The assumption that paying customers will eventually come knocking is not enough for Gaume and countless other critics of the Gila diversion. According to Gaume’s calculations using Bureau of Reclamation data, the monthly cost of water for residents of Deming would rise more than 10-fold if they paid for their full share of the project.

Allyson Siwik, executive director of the Gila Conservation Coalition, which opposes the diversion, said the group has been making the economic argument from the start.

“People do not want to face facts that the New Mexico Unit is a pipe dream,” Siwik told Circle of Blue. “It defies logic when we could fund non-diversion alternatives to meet our needs at a fraction of the cost.”

Dozens of proposals were submitted to the ISC from towns, irrigation districts, and watershed organizations for spending the AWSA money. The ISC selected 15 projects to consider for funding, 12 of which do not divert water from the Gila. Those projects include lining irrigation ditches to cut seepage losses, municipal conservation programs, new groundwater wells, and recycling wastewater. Siwik points out that all 12 could be funded in full by the AWSA money. The combined cost of the 12 projects, according to the ISC, is $US 72 million. The ISC, however, decided at recent meetings to allocate $US 9.1 to the non-diversion projects.

A few of the non-diversion projects are better bargains. The Bureau of Reclamation found that municipal conservation and wastewater reuse had the highest ratio of benefits to cost.

Now architects in China have taken the concept one step further by designing the Sanlian Public Library on secluded sands in Qinhuangdao City.

Recently crowned 'China's loneliest library', visitors have to walk to reach the building as there are no roads nearby.

Secluded: Sanlian Public Library stands on a quiet beach with no road access in Qinhuangdao City

Its distinctive shape stands alone on the near-untouched beach, as the sea laps the shore just metres away.

The library, which only opened this month is already proving very popular with people coming from across the country to borrow a book.

Ms Zhang, from Beijing, told People's Daily Online that she came to visit as soon as she heard about it.

'I am a sound designer and work in animation and documentaries,' she said.

'This place is very quiet and I hope to find inspiration here.'

Architect Dong Gong was behind the distinctive design, which stands alone on the seafront in Changli.

Sea view: Visitors to the library can read a book while enjoying incredible sea views through the glass frontage

Quiet: The building is the only thing in sight for miles with no roads leading to the secluded spot

Inside: Visitors to the library can check out books from the first and second floors

Lonely: The building was designed to convey a sense of the quietness of the secluded beach and inspired by its pebbles

He said he was struck by a deep sense of loneliness when he visited the distant location but felt a 'strong sense of presence', and inspired by the stones lying nearby.

There are books available on the first and second floor, with visitors reading quietly while getting to admire the stunning sea views.

He wanted to make use natural light by installing plenty of skylights and light tubes. The effect peaks at about 1.30pm each day as light floods into the building, creating incredible shadowy effects.

Water and electricity are piped to the building underground while the building had to be damp-proofed to ensure it is not prone to damage by the sea.

Light reading: The library was designed to make the most of the natural light on the beachfront

Unusual: The library can only be reached on foot with these people walking across the sands to get in

Ha Noi's sewers and drains are said to be inadequate to cope with heavy flooding. — VNS Photo Doan Tung

HA NOI (VNS) — Ha Noi's sewers and drains are said to be inadequate to cope with heavy flooding, likely to arrive with the coming storm season.

Canals traditionally used to drain water from the growing city have been narrowed down by piles of plastic and other solid rubbish in recent years, severely limiting their capacity to drain water into the city's rivers.

The city's authorities plan to clear the canals this month, as well as lower water levels in main lakes to handle heavy rain.

Many city projects to improve water drainage are reported to be have been completed, but not yet connected to the city's network.

Several key projects, such as upgrading water-holding capacity at Dam Chuoi, Phuong Liet and Tan Mai lakes, have hit problems because they are blocked by old buildings sitting across low water drainage sites or else have encroached on public land.

The owners of these structures are refusing to be relocated or are holding out for compensation, said Pham Van Cuong, director of the Ha Noi Water Drainage Project.

The city's People Committee has also ordered districts and wards to provide their own solutions to prevent flooding, especially in areas known to be susceptible during heavy rains.

The city's sewerage authority, Ha Noi Sewerage and Drainage Ltd (HSDC), said flood preparation for the 12 central districts was underway.

However, for the rest of the city, co-ordination among local agencies would be the key to solving any flooding during the storm season.

Vo Tien Hung, director general of HSDC said during prolonged and heavy rains there might be up to 50 sites flooded in the city. Most of them were near the low-level Ha Noi Southern Bus Station in Hoang Mai District.

Hung said predicted flooding would occur on the city's ring roads, such as Pham Van Dong and Nguyen Xien, as their drainage systems had not been completed even though they were flooded every year.

To quickly respond to flooding, Nguyen Quoc Hung, deputy chairman of the city's People Committee, has asked the city's construction department and sewerage authority to remain constantly vigilant with equipment and machines on stand-by at all times. — VNS","Thu, 14 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://image.vietnamnews.vn/uploadvnnews/Storage/Images/2015/5/14/05-ngap.jpg,"['unfit', 'heavy', 'vns', 'ha', 'noi', 'city', 'citys', 'water', 'tackle', 'drains', 'sewerage', 'drainage', 'flooding']",

(A: Everyone) – Krebs on Security - Krebs on Security,https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/05/whos-scanning-your-network-a-everyone/,"Not long ago I heard from a reader who wanted advice on how to stop someone from scanning his home network, or at least recommendations about to whom he should report the person doing the scanning. I couldn’t believe that people actually still cared about scanning, and I told him as much: These days there are countless entities — some benign and research-oriented, and some less benign — that are continuously mapping and cataloging virtually every device that’s put online.

One of the more benign is scans.io, a data repository of research findings collected through continuous scans of the public Internet. The project, hosted by the ZMap Team at the University of Michigan, includes huge, regularly updated results grouped around scanning for Internet hosts running some of the most commonly used “ports” or network entryways, such as Port 443 (think Web sites protected by the lock icon denoting SSL/TLS Web site encryption); Port 21, or file transfer protocol (FTP); and Port 25, or simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), used by many businesses to send email.

When I was first getting my feet wet on the security beat roughly 15 years ago, the practice of scanning networks you didn’t own looking for the virtual equivalent of open doors and windows was still fairly frowned upon — if not grounds to get one into legal trouble. These days, complaining about being scanned is about as useful as griping that the top of your home is viewable via Google Earth. Trying to put devices on the Internet and then hoping that someone or something won’t find them is one of the most futile exercises in security-by-obscurity.

To get a gut check on this, I spoke at length last week with University of Michigan researcher Zakir Durumeric (ZD) and Michael D. Bailey at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (MB) about their ongoing and very public project to scan all the Internet-facing things. I was curious to get their perspective on how public perception of widespread Internet scanning has changed over the years, and how targeted scanning can actually lead to beneficial results for Internet users as a whole.

MB: Because of the historic bias against scanning and this debate between disclosure and security-by-obscurity, we’ve approached this very carefully. We certainly think that the benefits of publishing this information are huge, and that we’re just scratching the surface of what we can learn from it.

ZD: Yes, there are close to two dozen papers published now based on broad, Internet-wide scanning. People who are more focused on comprehensive scans tend to be the more serious publications that are trying to do statistical or large-scale analyses that are complete, versus just finding devices on the Internet. It’s really been in the last year that we’ve started ramping up and adding scans [to the scans.io site] more frequently.

BK: What are your short- and long-term goals with this project?

ZD: I think long-term we do want to add coverage of additional protocols. A lot of what we’re focused on is different aspects of a protocol. For example, if you’re looking at hosts running the “https://” protocol, there are many different ways you can ask questions depending on what perspective you come from. You see different attributes and behavior. So a lot of what we’ve done has revolved around https, which is of course hot right now within the research community.

MB: I’m excited to add other protocols. There are a handful of protocols that are critical to operations of the Internet, and I’m very interested in understanding the deployment of DNS, BGP, and TLS’s interception with SMTP. Right now, there’s a pretty long tail to all of these protocols, and so that’s where it starts to get interesting. We’d like to start looking at things like programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and things that are responding from industrial control systems.

ZD: One of the things we’re trying to pay more attention to is the world of embedded devices, or this ‘Internet of Things’ phenomenon. As Michael said, there are also industrial protocols, and there are different protocols that these embedded devices are supporting, and I think we’ll continue to add protocols around that class of devices as well because from a security perspective it’s incredibly interesting which devices are popping up on the Internet.

BK: What are some of the things you’ve found in your aggregate scanning results that surprised you?

ZD: I think one thing in the “https://” world that really popped out was we have this very large certificate authority ecosystem, and a lot of the attention is focused on a small number of authorities, but actually there is this very long tail — there are hundreds of certificate authorities that we don’t really think about on a daily basis, but that still have permission to sign for any Web site. That’s something we didn’t necessary expect. We knew there were a lot, but we didn’t really know what would come up until we looked at those.

There also was work we did a couple of years ago on cryptographic keys and how those are shared between devices. In one example, primes were being shared between RSA keys, and because of this we were able to factor a large number of keys, but we really wouldn’t have seen that unless we started to dig into that aspect [their research paper on this is available here].

MB: One of things we’ve been surprised about is when we measure these things at scale in a way that hasn’t been done before, often times these kinds of emergent behaviors become clear.

BK: Talk about what you hope to do with all this data.

ZD: We were involved a lot in the analysis of the Heartbleed vulnerability. And one of the surprising developments there wasn’t that there were lots of people vulnerable, but it was interesting to see who patched, how and how quickly. What we were able to find was by taking the data from these scans and actually doing vulnerability notifications to everybody, we were able to increase patching for the Heartbleed bug by 50 percent. So there was an interesting kind of surprise there, not what you learn from looking at the data, but in terms of what actions do you take from that analysis? And that’s something we’re incredibly interested in: Which is how can we spur progress within the community to improve security, whether that be through vulnerability notification, or helping with configurations.

BK: How do you know your notifications helped speed up patching?

MB: With the Heartbleed vulnerability, we took the known vulnerable population from scans, and ran an A/B test. We split the population that was vulnerable in half and notified one half of the population, while not notifying the other half, and then measured the difference in patching rates between the two populations. We did end up after a week notifying the second population…the other half.

BK: How many people did you notify after going through the data from the Heartbleed vulnerability scanning?

ZD: We took everyone on the IPv4 address space, found those that were vulnerable, and then contacted the registered abuse contact for each block of IP space. We used data from 200,000 hosts, which corresponded to 4,600 abuse contacts, and then we split those into an A/B test. [Their research on this testing was published here].

So, that’s the other thing that’s really exciting about this data. Notification is one thing, but the other is we’ve been building models that are predictive of organizational behavior. So, if you can watch, for example, how an organization runs their Web server, how they respond to certificate revocation, or how fast they patch — that actually tells you something about the security posture of the organization, and you can start to build models of risk profiles of those organizations. It moves away from this sort of patch-and-break or patch-and-pray game we’ve been playing. So, that’s the other thing we’ve been starting to see, which is the potential for being more proactive about security.

BK: How exactly do you go about the notification process? That’s a hard thing to do effectively and smoothly even if you already have a good relationship with the organization you’re notifying….

MB: I think one of the reasons why the Heartbleed notification experiment was so successful is we did notifications on the heels of a broad vulnerability disclosure. The press and the general atmosphere and culture provided the impetus for people to be excited about patching. The overwhelming response we received from notifications associated with that were very positive. A lot of people we reached out to say, ‘Hey, this is a great, please scan me again, and let me know if I’m patched.” Pretty much everyone was excited to have the help.

Another interesting challenge was that we did some filtering as well in cases where the IP address had no known patches. So, for example, where we got information from a national CERT [Computer Emergency Response Team] that this was an embedded device for which there was no patch available, we withheld that notification because we felt it would do more harm than good since there was no path forward for them. We did some aggregation as well, because it was clear there were a lot of DSL and dial-up pools affected, and we did some notifications to ISPs directly.

BK: You must get some pushback from people about being included in these scans. Do you think that idea that scanning is inherently bad or should somehow prompt some kind of reaction in and of itself, do you think that ship has sailed?

ZD: There is some small subset that does have issues. What we try to do with this is be as transparent as possible. All of our hosts we use for scanning, if look at them on WHOIS records or just visit them with a browser it will tell you right away that this machine is part of this research study, here’s the information we’re collecting and here’s how you can be excluded. A very small percentage of people who visit that page will read it and then contact us and ask to be excluded. If you send us an email [and request removal], we’ll remove you from all future scans. A lot of this comes down to education, a lot of people to whom we explain our process and motives are okay with it.

BK: Are those that object and ask to be removed more likely to be companies and governments, or individuals?

ZD: It’s a mix of all of them. I do remember offhand there were a fair number of academic institutions and government organizations, but there were a surprising number of home users. Actually, when we broke down the numbers last year (PDF), the largest category was small to mid-sized businesses. This time last year, we had excluded only 157 organizations that had asked for it.

BK: Was there any pattern to those that asked to be excluded?

ZD: I think that actually is somewhat interesting: The exclusion requests aren’t generally coming from large corporations, which likely notice our scanning but don’t have an issue with it. A lot of emails we get are from these small businesses and organizations that really don’t know how to interpret their logs, and often times just choose the most conservative route.

So we’ve been scanning for a several years now, and I think when we originally started scanning, we expected to have all the people who were watching for this to contact us all at once, and say ”Please exclude us.’ And then we sort of expected that the number of people who’d ask to be excluded would plateau, and we wouldn’t have problems again. But what we’ve seen is, almost the exact opposite. We still get [exclusion request] emails each day, but what we’re really finding is people aren’t discovering these scans proactively. Instead, they’re going through their logs while trying to troubleshoot some other issue, and they see a scan coming from us there and they don’t know who we are or why we’re contacting their servers. And so it’s not these organizations that are watching, it’s the ones who really aren’t watching who are contacting us.

BK: Do you guys go back and delete historic records associated with network owners that have asked to be excluded from scans going forward?

ZD: At this point we haven’t gone back and removed data. One reason is there are published research results that are based on those data sets, results, and so it’s very hard to change that information after the fact because if another researcher went back and tried to confirm an experiment or perform something similar, there would be no easy way of doing that.

BK: Is this what you’re thinking about for the future of your project? How to do more notification and build on the data you have for those purposes? Or are you going in a different or additional direction?

MB: When I think about the ethics of this kind of activity, I have very utilitarian view: I’m interested in doing as much good as we possibly can with the data we have. I think that lies in notifications, being proactive, helping organizations that run networks to better understand what their external posture looks like, and in building better safe defaults. But I’m most interested in a handful of core protocols that are under-serviced and not well understood. And so I think we should spend a majority of effort focusing on a small handful of those, including BGP, TLS, and DNS.

ZD: In many ways, we’re just kind of at the tip of this iceberg. We’re just starting to see what types of security questions we can answer from these large-scale analyses. I think in terms of notifications, it’s very exciting that there are things beyond the analysis that we can use to actually trigger actions, but that’s something that clearly needs a lot more analysis. The challenge is learning how to do this correctly. Every time we look at another protocol, we start seeing these weird trends and behavior we never noticed before. With every protocol we look at there are these endless questions that seem to need to be answered. And at this point there are far more questions than we have hours in the day to answer.","Sun, 10 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GF5.png,"['network', 'data', 'scans', 'weve', 'krebs', 'whos', 'things', 'thats', 'really', 'protocols', 'lot', 'think', 'security', 'scanning']", 
55,55,FL-2015-000057-CHN,9 Ways to Survive an EMP Attack (And Other Doomsday Scenarios to Watch For) - Outdoor Life Magazine,https://www.outdoorlife.com/emp-survival-9-ways-prepare-electro-magnetic-pulse/,"Few survival scenarios have captured the imagination (or spawned fear) like the electro-magnetic pulse. This event or weapon, commonly known as an EMP, creates a short burst of electromagnetic energy that can disrupt or even destroy electronic devices and systems, potentially even the electrical power grid. An EMP can occur naturally, such as the pulse from a massive solar flare, but EMPs are also created by technological devices, typically nuclear weapons.

The most frightening scenario is the detonation of several high-energy EMPs over an unsuspecting nation. According to some models, just a few of these devices detonated at a high altitude could wipe out all of the unshielded electronics and all power grids in the continental United States. Commonly used as fodder for apocalyptic novels like One Second After and doomsday TV shows like NBC’s Revolution, these weapons have become a fixture of pop culture. In the event that this threat moves from fiction to reality, here are some things you ought to consider having in place.

1. Non-Electric Appliances

As long as the sun shines, food can be cooked and water can be boiled. Tim MacWelch

No electricity to operate your electric can opener? If you had a hand-operated one, Fluffy wouldn’t have to go without her Fancy Feast. Check out camping catalogs and companies that sell non-electric household devices. There is a surprising number of choices in the marketplace. Here are a few:

1. Solar oven: As long as the sun shines, food can be cooked and water can be boiled.

2. Manual can opener: The P38 is a military classic, and it even fits on a key chain.

3. Grain and meat grinders: Grind flour from whole grains or create burger meat from available critters.

4. Crank coffee grinder: For the caffeine addicts who turns up their nose at instant java.

5. Wind-up flashlight: Will light the way, assuming the electronics inside it weren’t fried by the pulse.

6. Butter churn: Find cow, milk cow, separate cream, churn butter, enjoy.

7. Hand-powered water pump: To get water out of a well or cistern

8. Well sleeve (or well bucket): This is one of the most important gadgets that most people have never heard of. A well bucket is a cylinder fitted with a couple hundred feet of string and lowered down slender modern wells to draw up water. This is a cheaper option for your well than a hand pump, but much more work.

2. Barter Items

Items to Barter Tim MacWelch

If the power is out, your credit and debit cards aren’t going to do you much good, and the ancient art of bartering once again becomes a viable economic option. It’s best to hold onto food with a long shelf life and weapons that could be used against you. But other items—goods that serve no major constructive use in the home but are popular nevertheless—could be parted with if you can find a willing trading partner.

Beans, bullets, and gasoline should be hoarded, but vices like alcohol, cigarettes, and caffeine; hygiene products; and various forms of entertainment, like books and playing cards, could be very valuable to the dependent, the dirty, and the bored.

3. Lighting

Dietz Original Lamp Tim MacWelch

Chemical light sticks are a good non-electric light source, but what about something with a longer burn time? Candles are EMP-proof, but they are dim, messy, and vulnerable to the wind. This is where oil lamps come into play, my favorite being the lightweight Dietz Original lamp. This classic lamp works indoors and outdoors, through wind and rain. The little lamp’s eight-ounce fuel capacity gives you an 11-hour burn time. The heat output is around 900 BTU’s per hour, and it puts out an average of 7 candle power with a half inch of burning wick exposed. The lamps cost about $11 each and operate on an average of 3 cents worth of lamp oil per hour. When’s the last time you received an hour’s worth of anything for 3 cents?

Approved Fuels for Oil Lamps:

Non-dyed (clear) kerosene Klean-heat kerosene substitute Standard clear lamp oil Citronella oil (outdoor use only)

Keep in mind that paraffin oil (wax oil, Nowell’s, Ultra-Pure, Tropical Lights, etc.) might be marketed for oil lamps, but it typically burns half as bright of any of the approved fuels listed above. Paraffin oil is thicker than those and its flash point is 100 degrees higher than kerosene. This inhibits the capillary action of the wick, and will cause lanterns with wicks 7/8 inch or larger to burn improperly and erratically. Once a wick is contaminated with paraffin, it must be replaced in order for the lamp to burn properly with a different fuel.

4. Hand Tools

Keep some backup hand tools in your tool chest. Tim MacWelch

Repairing and reinforcing your home won’t be very easy if all your tools require electricity. Keep some backup hand tools in your tool chest. Hand saws and a hammer are obvious choices, but grab some less obvious choices too, like planes, block sanders, and a brace and bit for hole drilling and driving screws. Add a variety of nails, screws, and glue to round out your tool set.

5. Faraday Cage

An old microwave can be used as a Faraday cage. Chris Kelly, via Flickr

A Faraday cage (named for the 19th-century inventor, Michael Faraday), is any conductive structure that protects its contents from electrical pulses. Your simplest option is an old microwave oven or a tightly sealed metal garbage can (other options include an ammo can or a metal safe). A Faraday cage is easy to build, but since we don’t know the exact level of damage that can be caused by a weaponized EMP, it’s impossible to say which electronics might survive. All we can do is rely on informed best guesses. Follow these steps and hope for the best.

How to Create a Faraday Cage

Determine what size box you’re going to need. Gather up everything you want to shield and see how much space they require. Likely items include shortwave radios, walkie-talkies, crucial medical equipment (i.e. a glucose meter), and spare electronic parts for your generator and car. Note that batteries are not affected by EMP, so they don’t need to be included in your stash. Choose a box or container that closes as securely as possible. Any gaps will render the grounding ineffective. Wrap your box securely in aluminum foil. Be sure the body of the box and its lid are totally encased. Tape every seam down firmly. You can use regular tape for this, although aluminum or copper tape will provide better security. Line the inside of the box with cardboard to ensure that your electronics do not contact any of the foil or metal tape. Place your items inside and seal the lid firmly.

The other option is to starting hoping that no one ever activates an EMP.

6. Communications

CB radios and walkie-talkies would be the most vital gear you’d store in a Faraday cage. Dave Smith, via Flickr

With our beloved mobile phones inoperable after an EMP, you’ll be left with few options for distance communication. This is where CB radios and walkie-talkies show their true worth. If these items are protected adequately in a Faraday cage, or the EMP was distant or of low strength, they might just work after the pulse is over. Install the batteries or an alternative power source and find out.

Unless you need medical electronics to live, communications equipment could be the most vital gear you’d store in a Faraday cage. It’s hard to impress upon the average modern person the luxury that they are tapping into every time they use a mobile phone. With that option gone, I’m sure that most millennials would succumb to temporary insanity.

7. Power Source

Use solar panels as a power source. Tim MacWelch

You could make your own electricity from solar panels, micro hydroelectric systems, and backyard wind turbine generators, along with noisy gasoline generators and vehicles modified with electrical outlets. But be aware that having electricity in a world without any would paint a big target on your back. It would almost certainly be best to keep things like this to yourself, and keep backup electronics like charge controllers and inverters in a shielded container.

Even then, your neighbors will start to wonder why you never run out of rechargeable batteries and the lights in your home are anything but candles. Invest in alternative power only after considering the risk-to-reward ratio. A few small solar panels and chargers may be all you really need (or dare to possess).

8. Self Defense Equipment

Self Defense Equipment Tim MacWelch

A home-defense shotgun and plenty of rounds to accompany it are potentially the most versatile means for self-defense in a grid-down scenario like an EMP attack. A variety of shotgun loads can be used both against home intruders and for hunting wild game. Many other items, besides the predictable shotguns, handguns, and rifles, can be used as tools for self-protection and defense.

These can be as simple as bells hanging on the inside of your entry doors. These noisy non-electric alarms are low-tech, but also very reliable. Guard dogs are another great way to protect the family, particularly in the dead of night. You could even pull out the hand tools mentioned above and board up a few ground floor windows in the back of the house and other likely ingress points around your home. No corners should be cut when it comes to your family’s defense during a crisis situation.

9. Food Production Supplies

Having the knowledge, means, and location to grow food crops and livestock might just keep you alive during a multi-year blackout. Tim MacWelch

Let’s face it, your hoard of MREs will only last so long. Either by time or consumption, there would come a day when you’d be out of food if an event like an EMP attack occurred. It could take years to restore power to a handful of regions, and in the meantime people would have to find ways to provide food for their families other than hitting the local grocery. Having the knowledge, means, and location to grow food crops and livestock might just keep you alive during a multi-year blackout.

Of course you’d need the seeds, livestock, and tools to jumpstart the system, as well as the knowledge of seed saving and livestock breeding, but a little experience and a few good books can set you on the right path. In the end, you might end up giving a large share of food to the warlord who controls the region, but at least you’ll have some food—and you’ll be a valuable person to the community.

18 More Ways The World Could (But Probably Won’t) End

Let’s face it, the world isn’t going to end anytime soon, but, that doesn’t mean it’s not a good time to entertain the different ways the world could end. Here are some of the most intriguing possibilities.

1. Worldwide Famine

The odds of some sort of food shortage in the world are 100 percent. Outdoor Life Online Editors

The Threat: A shortage Of safe food for a growing population.

The 2012 heat waves and drought in the United States and Africa have left two continents with less food than normal this year. What if crop loss and famine become a regular occurrence? What if something worse than weather caused a run on food?

The Preps: Governments and individual citizens worldwide are taking their own precautions against any form of food supply disruption by stockpiling their own food stores. Not surprisingly, interest in home vegetable gardening and canning food are also making a strong resurgence. FEMA now recommends a two-week supply for everyone. If this scenario troubles you, then stock up for longer than two weeks.

The Odds: The odds of some sort of food shortage in the world are 100 percent. In Chad and other countries of western Africa, 18 million people are suffering from a food shortage as we speak. But the odds are low that we will see a significant food shortage in the US due to the weather anytime soon. The odds of a shortage of safe food are anybody’s guess if the disruption in the supply chain results from terrorist tampering, hyperinflation, or a radiological event.

2. Water, Water Everywhere

Planning ahead can begin by choosing a place to live that is higher and dryer than the surrounding area. Outdoor Life Online Editors

The Threat: Tsunamis and flooding.

Storm-related flooding and earthquake-induced tsunamis pose the threat of loss of property and loss of life to people living in low lying and coastal areas around the globe.

The Preps: Precautions against flooding are diverse. Planning ahead can begin by choosing a place to live that is higher and dryer than the surrounding area. Flood insurance may help cover your property losses, but the only reasonable way to safeguard your life is to keep one eye on the weather, and one ear to the radio for emergency broadcasts about storms, flooding, and tsunamis in your area.

The Odds: Earthquakes and storms cause flooding each year. The worst of the 2012 floods occurred in southwestern Russia in early July. It claimed 144 lives and the homes of nearly 13,000 people were damaged or destroyed in that flood. Your odds will be based on where you live.

3. Tech Meltdown

It is impossible to predict when or if a major cyberattack will ever happen. Outdoor Life Online Editors

The Threat: Cyber terrorism.

With so many computers and computer hackers in the world, concerns over cyber terrorism have governments and big business worried about national and global computer security. These aren’t just simple computer crimes like bank account hacking and identity theft. William L. Tafoya, Ph.D., one of the FBI’s cyber terror specialists, explains that “acts of cyber terror…impact society–even the nation–not just an individual, the business sector, or government agencies.”

The Preps: Unless you are already living an Luddite’s lifestyle, there is nothing that an individual can do to keep a localized, national, or global computer meltdown from affecting his or her way of life. Sorry.

The Odds: It is impossible to predict when or if a major cyberattack will ever happen. Dr. Tafoya simply concludes that “law enforcement agencies should be prepared to deal with the aftermath of hard-to-forecast, but not regularly reccurring, cyberattacks on the nation’s critical infrastructure.”

4. Crude Shortage

This socioeconomic scenario may not seem as scary as an asteroid impact or world war, but the effects could be just as far reaching. Outdoor Life Online Editors

The Threat: A worldwide oil crisis

In some circles, the question of whether the world’s oil fields have reached “peak oil” is hotly debated. If we have used up half of our world’s oil in the past 100 years, what kind of crisis would we face if the supply diminishes as world populations continue to grow? This socioeconomic scenario may not seem as scary as an asteroid impact or world war, but the effects could be just as far reaching.

The Preps: If the supply of oil dwindles, or if warfare or politics put a choke hold on the petroleum supply, you can expect the price of everything to go through the roof. It’s certainly not practical to create your own fuel tanks and stock up now, but it may be smart to wean yourself off things that require petroleum, like heating your home with oil.

The Odds: The easily extracted oil will almost certainly run out at some point, and there is no other known fuel that is as energy dense as oil. The earth’s crust is petroleum rich, but once the easy pickings are gone, oil and gas will cost more to obtain and the collection of it may bring more environmental damages. The real questions are simple: When will the oil run out, and how will it be replaced? I think the answers are already known, but we aren’t allowed in the meetings of the people who know such things.

5. Global Warfare

Some would say that WWIII is absolutely going to happen, it’s just a matter of when it will occur Outdoor Life Online Editors

The Threat: World War 3

Fears of a third World War have been inspiring preppers since the end of the last World War. This is easily the scariest event on our list, because it could happen at any time for any number of reasons, if diplomacy ever fails.

The Preps: The preps for WWIII are difficult to even discuss. Bunkers and years’ worth of stockpiled food and water are a good start.

The Odds: Some would say that WWIII is absolutely going to happen, it’s just a matter of when it will occur, who will be involved and why. America and her allies have many enemies, some old and some new. Some Biblical scholars will point to Armageddon as the third (and final) world war. I’d say it’s too close to call, and too unthinkable to dwell on.

6. The Walking Dead

Some folks believe that zombies will someday be a real threat. Outdoor Life Online Editors

The Threat: Zombie apocalypse

Zombies are everywhere we look these days, in videogames, on television and in the movies. Going a step further, some folks believe that zombies will someday be a real threat to the world. In essence, zombies would be an undead case of life imitating art.

The Preps: You could join a zombie hunting group, like ZERT, the Zombie Eradication Response Team. You could also study the CDC’s guide for zombie preparedness. The CDC’s tongue-in-cheek guide espouses the idea that “if you are generally well equipped to deal with a zombie apocalypse, you will be prepared for a hurricane, pandemic, earthquake, or terrorist attack.”

The Odds: The likelihood of an actual zombie outbreak is thankfully low, since zombies don’t actually exist. And I think it’s great that people can gather together under the mantle of being a zombie club and perform beneficial charity work as they do. Some clubs, like Zombie Squad (link www.zombiehunters.org), operate as a non-profit, having fund raisers and organizing volunteers for real charities such as the American Red Cross and Habitat For Humanity.

7. Pole Shift

Some “abductees” have said that aliens told them the poles would shift. Outdoor Life Online Editors

The Threat: The shifting or reversal of Earth’s magnetic poles.

Pole shift and pole reversal predictions have arguably the most colorful and diverse group of backers of any version of Doomsday. Some “abductees” have said that aliens told them the poles would shift. Spiritual medium Edgar Cayce predicted it would happen, too. Even well-known scientists have published peer reviewed papers saying that it would happen. Polar shift proponents date back as far as Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg, who in 1872 wrote an article suggesting that he had interpreted ancient Mexican codices that told how the earth’s axis would tip and cause periodic cataclysms.

The Preps: If a pole shift or reversal happened within a short period (say weeks, days, or hours), earthquakes and tsunamis would be the primary dangers to address. Other hazards of pole shift could include temporary vulnerability to incoming solar radiation, volcanic eruptions and radical climate change. Prep as you would for earthquakes and storms, and you should have this one covered.

The Odds: The odds of a polar shift are a little tricky to explain. The poles do drift a little each year, and there is scientific proof of polar “wander.” There is also geological evidence that the magnetic poles have been in radically different places over the past millennia. In the entire Earth’s history, polar wander of approximately 55 degrees may have occurred twice, but the poles have not deviated by more than about 5 degrees over the last 130 million years. Honesty, I wouldn’t sweat this one. Zombies seem like a more plausible threat than pole shift.

8. Epic Eruption

If you are living downwind of a potential super volcano, treat this like a nuclear winter scenario. Outdoor Life Online Editors

The Threat: Super volcano.

The caldera under Yellowstone National Park could erupt as a super volcano. China’s Changbaishan Volcano, Indonesia’s Mount Lokon, and the Mud Volcano of Azerbaijan could also blow up. Entire continents could be covered in ash as smoke darkens the skies.

The Preps: If you are living downwind of a potential super volcano, treat this like a nuclear winter scenario. In the short term, you’d need breathing apparatus to filter out the dangerous volcanic ash (which could cut up your lungs like glass dust). For the long term, you’d need lots of food and drinkable water.

The Odds: According to the U.S. Geological Survey, a volcano in Indonesia erupted 74,000 years ago, darkening the world’s skies for 11 years and wiping out most of the life on earth. Many geologists predict that the planet is due for another big one. The good news is that volcanos create recognizable seismic warnings, giving us time to evacuate or at least hunker down for such a disaster. The National Park Service has stated that “although [Yellowstone] eruption is theoretically possible, it is very unlikely to occur in the next thousand or even 10,000 years.”

9. Shaken to the Core

Earthquake preparedness is pretty much “by the book.” Outdoor Life Online Editors

The Threat: Mega earthquake.

Massive earthquakes have happened before, and many little earthquakes happen every day. What happens if a big one hits the U.S.? Will it drop California into the Pacific? Will the Gulf of Mexico flood into the Midwest?

The Preps: Earthquake preparedness is pretty much “by the book.” You need structurally safe shelter, clean water, first aid supplies, food, communications, and all the other usual suspects. For greater details, check out FEMA’s disaster kit guidelines and supply lists.

The Odds: The chances of a massive, city-destroying earthquake are slim, but there is always a chance. The U.S. Geological Survey’s earthquake website allows you to track active earthquakes, and even generate an earthquake probability for your area based on your latitude and longitude.

10. Boulder Bombardment

Even a small asteroid strike could set off a chain reaction of tsunamis, earthquakes, and volcanoes Outdoor Life Online Editors

The Threat: Asteroid strike.

A hunk of space rock only 6 miles wide is believed to have wiped out the dinosaurs 65.5 million years ago; and there are plenty more boulders where that one came from. Even a small asteroid strike could set off a chain reaction of tsunamis, earthquakes, and volcanoes, in addition to the localized destruction at the impact site.

The Preps: Prepping for an asteroid impact falls somewhere between prepping for volcanoes and earthquakes. There might be harmful dust in the air, as with a volcanic event. You may see earthquakes and tidal waves nearer to the actual strike location. Prep as you would for an earthquake, and treat yourself to some respirators.

The Odds: Since there are literally hundreds of thousands of amateur and professional astronomers peering at the night sky, I don’t think any big asteroids are going to slip past the goalie unnoticed. And for the first time in the earth’s history, this planet’s inhabitants may have the technology to address the threat of asteroids, meteors, and comets. This one looks pretty far-fetched.

11. A Greater Depression

Many preparedness enthusiasts plan for economic hard times by stockpiling goods that have a high trade value. Outdoor Life Online Editors

The Threat: Economic collapse.

Since we all live in a global village of trade and interdependence, drastic loss in value of our dollar or a major trading partner’s currency could send us into a situation much worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s.

The Preps: Many preparedness enthusiasts plan for economic hard times by stockpiling goods that have a high trade value. If the dollar is worthless, what would have value? The quick answer is the necessities and the luxuries. While people need food, safe water, medicines, and clothing; people will also be foaming at the mouth for caffeine, nicotine, alcohol and a host of other things that humans cannot seem to live without.

The Odds: All prior economic systems that have ever existed eventually failed. True story. But the silver lining is that most of these systems just changed, from one valuable to another or from an old currency to a new one. Let’s hope the odds are in our favor and that we don’t see the Great Depression Part 2 or some ridiculous One World Dollar in our lifetime.

12. Worldwide Sickness

The super flu, smallpox, or some new contagion strikes our highly mobile modern world and spreads like wild fire Outdoor Life Online Editors

The Threat: Pandemic disease.

The super flu, smallpox, or some new contagion strikes our highly mobile modern world and spreads like wild fire, killing or incapacitating the infected, and grinding government and commerce to a halt. This has been the plot of several sci-fi movies, and it has happened before in real life–many times. Just a few historic pandemics include the Spanish Influenza of 1918 (link http://www.flu.gov/pandemic/history/1918/), the smallpox brought to the Aztecs and other early Americans from Europe, the Black Plague in 1400s Europe and the Plague of Athens dating all the way back 430 BC.

The Preps: Pandemic preps include gathering supplies to survive a month or more, as well as abundant safety gear like masks, gloves, and disinfectant. If a pandemic should occur, barricade yourself and stay home for a month.

The Odds: The odds don’t look good for us. Neither does our track record. Humans are absolutely filthy creatures, and this category doesn’t exclude altered or man-made pathogens such a biological weapons. Scary.

13. Nuclear Nightmare

Let’s hope the right people keep protecting us from this one. Outdoor Life Online Editors

The Threat: Radiological event.

Whether a nuclear reactor melts down, a dirty bomb goes off, or somebody pops a nuclear warhead, we’ll be faced withthe same problem: dangerous radiation.

The Preps: Time and distance are your best friends when it comes to surviving a radiological hazard. Distance yourself from the area of contamination as quickly as you can. Distance yourself from your contaminated clothing and gear too. Time is also your best friend. Hour by hour, radiation dissipates. If you couldn’t make it to your nearest fallout shelter, shelter in place for as long as you can.

The Odds: Three Mile Island, the Chernobyl nuclear facility and the Fukushima power plant have all created modern nuclear disasters, and put dangerous radiation into their neighboring areas. The abundance of radioactive material in the world is also making it easier each year for someone to build a dirty bomb. Let’s hope the right people keep protecting us from this one.

14. Heating Up

Global Warming causes freak storms and long droughts Outdoor Life Online Editors

The Threat: Global warming.

This controversial concept carries a host of possible threats. The earth’s alleged warming has been blamed for wild weather, the melting of polar ice, disrupted ocean currents, and a number of other problems.

The Preps: If Global Warming causes freak storms and long droughts, as its proponents claim, then the preps would be a combination of hurricane prepping and food shortage preparedness.

The Odds: The earth’s average temperature has risen 1.4 degrees F since 1980. This is a documented fact. And the temperature is a lot higher now than it was during that last ice age. Where will the temperature top out? And what climatic effects would these higher temps have? I guess we’ll have to wait and see.

15. Space Weather

“Space weather” has inspired some preppers to take action and prepare for the worst. Outdoor Life Online Editors

The Threat: Solar flares.

Concern over solar flares, coronal mass ejections, gamma ray bursts and a variety of other “space weather” has inspired some preppers to take action and prepare for the worst. The Preps: Monstrous solar flares and CMEs certainly could impact our communication satellites and our electrical grid. Practical emergency preparedness plans for these types of scenarios should include the gathering of gear to provide your own energy and communications, along with all the normal necessities.

The Odds: Next year has been predicted as an active year for solar storms and sunspots. Autumn of 2013 will be the solar maximum, which is the period of greatest solar activity in the 11-year solar cycle of the sun. This upcoming maximum should also be the smallest sunspot cycle since 1906. One NASA spokesperson called it “wimpy.” We’ll be able to enjoy the northern lights a bit further south, but that should be about all.

16. Planet X

If it’s on the History Channel, it has to be true and really have happened…right? Outdoor Life Online Editors

The Threat: Nibiru will crash into earth.

Stories of Planet X (a.k.a. Nibiru) have been circulating since Zecharia Sitchin published a book in 1977 titled The 12th Planet. In this book, Sitchin claimed that “ancient astronauts” from Nibiru visited the Sumerians in the distant past and taught these primitives about writing, agriculture, and advanced sciences. Some Nibiru subscribers believe that this planet will strike the earth, or cause some other kind of catastrophe. Or that our cruel alien overlords will return to enslave mankind, or perhaps feast on our succulent flesh, or steal our women and precious metals.

The Preps: These preps are entertaining. Just pop some popcorn, sit back in your easy chair and watch the Ancient Aliens show on the History Channel. If it’s on the History Channel, it has to be true and really have happened…right?

The Odds: What do you think the odds are?

17. Power Down

An absence of electricity would create all kinds of communication, commerce, and transportation nightmares. Outdoor Life Online Editors

The Threat: Loss of the power grid.

Alarmingly, people from all over the world are trying to hack into the computer systems of nuclear power plants and other electric plants in the U.S., every day. What if they get lucky, get in, and shut things down?

The Preps: An absence of electricity would create all kinds of communication, commerce, and transportation nightmares. But that’s not the worst of it. Like many other disaster scenarios, the problem itself isn’t so bad–it’s peoples’ reactions and behavior that cause the real trouble. I hope you have a remote cabin to hide in until the power comes back on.

The Odds: This could happen somewhere, sometime. It’s plausible. Thank God that there are dedicated cyber security personnel working day and night to keep these technological disasters at bay.

The Threat: An alien invasion

War Of The Worlds, Independence Day, Alien Versus Predator, Battle: Los Angeles, and a slew of other films show us different critters having their way with our planet. What if that really happened?

The Preps: How do we fight an alien invasion? Well, it would depend on the alien. Are we actually having this conversation? I don’t want to dignify this one with a response.

Her rent covers water and electricity, as well as Wi-Fi and cleaning of common spaces every two weeks.

Many investors are betting that there will be a lot more Joyce Ges arriving in the coming years.

Their bet is a simple one: As students from the world’s growing middle and upper classes flock to London for higher education, the stark supply-demand imbalance in student housing will grow.

International college students are pouring into London, deepening an extensive housing shortage. The result is that student housing is becoming another red-hot corner of the city’s property market. That has tempted international pension funds, major private equity players and real estate giants to build up or sell off large portfolios of buildings for handsome profits. The values of many of these portfolios are rising (and consequently, yields are falling) as a result of the intense investor interest.

A man has been spotted on multiple occasions entering a ladies’ restroom at a shopping center in the Pengjiang district of Jiangmen city, Guangdong province and eating excrement found in the toilet.



According to a security guard at the shopping plaza, the man has been spotted visiting the toilets since early this year.

“He goes to the second floor ladies’ room to find [feces] to eat. He usually comes between 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. during the first half of the day, and then comes again at around 3:00 p.m.,” the guard said, adding that the man walks in on women before they’re able to finish flushing the toilet.

A local female resident told Guangdong TV that reports of the man wandering into the public restrooms have left her feeling incredibly uneasy, especially because he’s been seen lurking in another female toilet nearby.

A doctor from the No. 3 Hospital of Jiangmen city told reporters that it’s very possible that he has a history of mental illness.

The women’s toilets at the mall have been locked up, and residents are now calling on the government to help seek treatment for the man.



Reporters spotted the man near a female restroom and attempted to get to the bottom of his unsanitary habit:

Reporter: What’re you doing here?

Man: Eating shit.

R: What? What’s in your hands?

M: It’s shit.

R: Why would you want to do that?

M: I eat it when I’m hungry.

R: But why do you choose to go to the ladies’ room?

M: It’s more tasty. Reporter: Isn’t your family worried about you?

Man: They’re all dead.

R: Don’t you know this behavior isn’t good or healthy?

M: I’ve eaten shit for eight years. I feel better after eating it.

61,61,FL-2015-000057-CHN,We need to get smarter to save shorebirds from rising seas - The Conversation AU,https://theconversation.com/we-need-to-get-smarter-to-save-shorebirds-from-rising-seas-41603,"The world record for the longest non-stop unpowered flight is held by a bar-tailed godwit that travelled 11,600 km from Alaska to New Zealand in just over eight days.

This bird’s remarkable journey was part of one of nature’s marvels, the annual migration of five million shorebirds between the Arctic and Australia along a bird superhighway known as the East Asian-Australasian flyway.

Now, in the southern autumn, many birds have left for their breeding grounds in the Northern Hemisphere. They will return in spring to escape the harsh northern winter.

But these birds are also highly threatened. For seven declining species on the flyway, populations have reduced by an average of 62% over the past 15 years, driven by habitat destruction, pollution and hunting. Now sea-level rise poses an even more uncertain future.

One way to protect these birds is to set aside protected areas where birds can move as seas rise. But there is a wide range of uncertainty in sea level projections, so how do we know which areas are most important to protect?

In research published this week in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, we used artificial intelligence that we developed to answer this question. We found that we could save at least 25,000 more birds than current conservation strategies.

Hungry birds

Like any long-distance travellers, most migratory birds need fuel to complete their journey. For shorebirds this means eating animals that live in coastal tidal flats (such as crabs, worms and bivalves) en route from birds’ breeding grounds to Australia.

However, coastal development is chewing up tidal flats at an alarming rate— already up to two thirds of tidal flat ecosystems in the Yellow Sea have been destroyed, with a further 2% disappearing annually. Exhausted birds arrive to find their feeding areas gone and must find an alternative or die trying.

Two shorebirds, the eastern curlew and curlew sandpiper, are likely to become the first migratory shorebirds to be added to the Australian threatened species list as a result of plummeting numbers caused by the rapid loss of their habitat.

Dean Ingwersen

Rising seas

On top of existing pressures — which also include pollution, disturbance and hunting — there is the threat of sea-level rise and extreme coastal weather events.

The low-lying coastal mudflats used by the birds are particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise, which is projected to increase by between 26 cm and 98 cm by 2100, with some studies suggesting seas could rise by more than a metre (and recent research suggests this process is speeding up).

This threat can be reduced by creating protected areas that give coastal habitats room to move as the sea level rises. However, although we know that bird populations are declining and have predictions for sea-level increases (even at local scales), uncertainty remains about the extent of sea level rise, future mitigation actions and what the impacts of that will be for bird populations.

Protecting species in a changing climate

Imagine a wetland visited by shorebirds in China’s Yellow Sea. Will it be there in the future or will it be flooded by rising seas? What will this mean for shorebird populations across the whole flyway?

This depends on a lot of factors, including the international response to rising carbon dioxide levels. We have to choose whether to protect the wetland even though we’re unsure about the future. Scientists have modelled scenarios that estimate which wetlands will flood under different scenarios, and can predict the most likely future scenario.

If we commit to a single sea level rise scenario and conditions change, the effort may be wasted because we protected the wrong place. It would be better if we could consider all scenarios when we choose a place to protect based on how likely they are to occur.

We are unlikely to be able to protect everywhere that we’d like to right now and it will take time to set up protected areas. We use a learning technique from artificial intelligence to decide when and where to put protected areas.

Our method works gradually, protecting the most important regions one at a time. We add new areas based on the best current information, accounting for the uncertainty in the future sea level rise. While we’re adding new areas, we compare how the sea level rise and bird populations are changing compared to scenario predictions and use that information to help us make better decisions in the future.

Because we learn as we go, we can adapt our protected area network to changing conditions. In this way we make the best decisions that we can right now, but also make sure that we keep our options open by considering all scenarios and learn as we go.

It’s not just sea level rise and birds that the algorithm can consider — it’s a general tool for making good conservation decisions in a changing environment.

We found that properly accounting for uncertainty in sea level rise can protect more birds than committing to a single scenario. Our simulations with 10 species found that accounting for model uncertainty protects 25,000 more birds than the current best method in the literature.

Where are the key areas?

Like previous studies, our work showed that protecting habitat in the Yellow Sea is critical to the future of our shorebirds, as a huge proportion of migrants stop in China or Korea as part of their migration.

However, although Australia accommodates fewer birds than the Yellow Sea, as the sea level rises, then Australia’s shorebird sites may have a more important role than previously thought.

Sea level rise is not uniform around the globe — different amounts of habitat are lost depending on the shape of the coast in each region. In Australia, a high sea level rise scenario will flood many of Australia’s coastal wetlands, with a big impact on migratory birds.

Sea levels are rising and will make life hard for our shorebirds. Artificial intelligence may provide the tools to help us overcome uncertainty and protect the habitat they need to keep on flying.","Wed, 13 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/81499/original/image-20150513-5781-3i14h9.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['save', 'seas', 'rising', 'birds', 'need', 'level', 'areas', 'uncertainty', 'rise', 'protect', 'smarter', 'sea', 'future', 'protected', 'shorebirds']",

Washington raised the pressure on Southeast Asia to open its ports to boatpeople on Saturday after migrants described a terrifying battle for survival between Rohingya and Bangladeshi passengers as their shunned vessel sank off Indonesia.

The US State Department said John Kerry had phoned his Thai counterpart ""to discuss the situation of migrants in the Andaman Sea and to discuss the possibility of Thailand providing temporary shelter for them"".

""We urge governments in the region to refrain from push-backs of new boat arrivals,"" State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke said.

He called on Southeast Asian authorities ""to work together quickly, first and foremost to save the lives of migrants.""

Southeast Asia is in the grips of a deepening crisis over a flood of boatpeople with Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand coming under pressure to rescue the starving and helpless migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar's oppressed Muslim Rohingya minority.

The UN refugee agency has reported a surge in departures from Bay of Bengal ports in recent months, and activists say 8,000 people may be adrift after a Thai crackdown severed busy human-trafficking routes.

Survivors of a boat that sank off the east coast of Sumatra island -- among roughly 900 people rescued off Indonesia on Friday -- described a violent struggle between Bangladeshis and Rohingya for scarce food and space.

""They were killing each other, throwing people overboard,"" said Sunarya, police chief of the city of Langsa near where they were rescued.

The jam-packed boat had put to sea two months ago, and with supplies running low, its Thai captain would shoot dead migrants who asked for food, said Muhammad Amin, a Rohingya.

Violent struggle on doomed boat

The captain and crew abandoned ship earlier this week, and as the boat was turned away first by Indonesia and then Malaysia, the Rohingya won a violent struggle for remaining supplies, said Bangladeshi survivor Muhammad Koyes.

""When we asked for food, they beat us. The Bangladeshis were very weak, so we could not fight back,"" he said.

More fighting broke out as the boat took on water, Muhammad Amin said, and he and others were thrown overboard. He drifted six hours before being rescued.

""Thank God we survived, I have a wife and children in Malaysia,"" he said.

Nearly 600 migrants were already sheltering in Sumatra's Aceh province after managing to get ashore in recent days.

The Bangladeshis are believed to be mainly economic migrants.

But Rohingya have been fleeing their homes in Rakhine state in droves -- bound largely for Malaysia -- to escape years of sectarian violence and discrimination in Buddhist-majority Myanmar.

Each spring, boats stream southward out of the Bay of Bengal, trying to beat seasonal monsoon storms. Hundreds die every year, according to the UN refugee agency.

The flow has surged recently as traffickers have duped migrants by waiving payment for passage, said Hla Myint, a Rohingya leader in a refugee camp near the Rakhine state capital Sittwe.

Instead, they later demand ransoms from migrants' families once at sea, or ashore in Thailand or Malaysia.

The trend has contributed to boats being held at sea for weeks.

UN chief Ban Ki-moon has called for migrants to be rescued, and his High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said Friday he was ""appalled"" at the migrant boat push-backs, warning that more will die.

But the head of Indonesia's armed forces stood firm.

""(Boatpeople) will not be allowed to enter our region. If they do, they may create social problems,"" General Moeldoko said, according to state-run media.

Amid regional finger-pointing, Myanmar -- which insists Rohingya are not its problem -- has snubbed a Thai call for a May 29 crisis summit.

The Thai navy discovered 106 Rohingya on an island off its west coast, a provincial governor said Friday.

Earlier, a boat carrying about 300 emaciated Rohingya left Thailand's waters, an official said, after authorities repaired its engine and provided food.

The Thai official said the migrants refused offers to land, apparently fearing deportation to Myanmar.

Metrology is defined as the science of measurement. Metrology dates back to the ancient world, but modern metrology is derived from the politics French revolution, where the standardisation of units was introduced.



Metrology can be split into different activities. The first activity defines the units of measurement, the second puts the units of measurement in practice, and the last applies them to traceability. Metrology can also be divided into further sub-fields of scientific, applied, industrial, technical and Legal metrology.

Metric Systems of the Ancient World

The system of measures, which is at the basis of all metric systems of the ancient world and China, was conceived prior to the appearance of cuneiform writing in Mesopotamia in approximately 2,900 B.C.

The system of measures dates as far back as 6,000 B.C., when it became necessary due to agricultural development needing to calculate the distribution of crops and the volume of food consumed by families. With the transition of humankind from nomadic groupings to established agricultural settlements, metrology was imperative in managing population growth and confronting famine.

It was not until 1875 at the Metre Convention that scientists recognised the need to establish a system of internationally agreed measurement standards. Prior to this, various systems existed across the world and were merged and transformed through trade and acculturation.

The Egyptian Cubit

As measurements were sometimes formed from a natural basis, their accuracy was difficult to determine. The Egyptian cubit, an ancient unit based on the forearm length, ranged between 43 and 53 cm throughout antiquity and depended on the Pharaoh reigning. The Egyptian royal cubit is the earliest recognised standard of measurement.

The flood level of the Nile in approximately 3,000 B.C. was given as 6 cubits and 1 palm, and the royal cubit was a crucial measurement in ancient Egyptian architecture from as early as 2,700 B.C.

The Roman Mile

Although the standardisation of the mile to 1.609 kilometres would not be established until an international agreement in 1959, the Roman mile of antiquity had consisted of a thousand paces of two steps each.

Armies marching through unchartered territories would drive sticks into the ground after each 1,000 paces, marking the length of the mile dependent on a variety of factors, including weather conditions, army logistics and the physical conditioning of soldiers.

Medieval Metrics

In medieval England, one form of measurement was used to calculate ounces of bullion and other tradable commodities, though its use was consistent with those recognised in both medieval Italian texts and ancient Athenian ones.

The inconsistencies, as well as regional and cultural differences of systems of measurement, prevented any universal application of a single standard of metrology. Without an effective means for the exchange and distribution of knowledge in the ancient and medieval worlds, it would be impossible for scientists, mathematicians, chemists and physicists to cooperate in the pursuit of progressive endeavours.

It would not be until the Scientific Revolution during the early modern period that metrology would cease from being utilised largely for the measurements of length, time and weight. As science advanced, a coherent system of units was required.

The discovery and identification of fundamental scientific principles such as electricity, atoms and thermodynamics allowed them to be applied to standards of measurement, thus facilitating the quantitative and qualitative assessment of physical properties in science.

The Role of Microscopy

Microscopy, one of the earliest methods of particle sizing, dates to 1590 when two Dutch spectacle makers, Hans and Zaccharias Janssen, developed the first compound microscope.

Though initially used as a tool of identification, the development of high-precision lenses, digital image capture, and high-speed computers, have given rise to a stratospheric leap in the capability of the microscope in the present day.

Microscopes are unique as they are able to describe a particle’s shape, which permits scientists a better understanding of not only constituent particles but also the behaviour of groups of particles.

Defining the Metre

Even in the eighteenth century, unified systems of measurement did not exist even on a national level. France, a centre of science and enlightenment during the Scientific Revolution, recorded in 1795 that there were over 700 different units of measurement in the country.

In 1791 a commission had been established to decide between three possible references of measurement:

the length of a pendulum beating at a rate of one second at a latitude of 45ᵒ

the length of one quarter of the equator

the distance from the North Pole to the equator (a quarter meridian)

The distance from the North Pole to the equator was chosen as the simplest reference of measurement to calculate. In the same year, the metre was defined as being equal to the ten millionth part of one quarter of the terrestrial medium.

The metre materialised the concept of a “unit which in its determination was neither arbitrary nor related to any particular nation on the globe.”

The length of the meridian had to be identified and the triangulation work carried out by Jean-Baptiste Joseph Delambre and Pierre-Francois Meçhain took 7 years to complete. It was recognised to be equivalent to 10 million metres.

The Decimal Metric System

With the recognition of one base unit of measurement, others had to be established. The decimal metric system was introduced in 1795 by a weights and measures law, and by 1799 the system had extended to encompass the first standards of the metre and kilogram for everyday use.

The decimal metric system, as a simple, accessible and universal method, began to spread outside of France during the early 19th century. The metric system was mandatory in the Netherlands from 1816 and was adopted by Spain in 1849.

The Industrial Revolution

The emergence of the Industrial Revolution depended on the adoption of accurate units of measurement, as mass production, equipment commonality and assembly lines would be impossible without one.

In a typical act of Anglo-Franco rivalry, the British imperial system of units was adopted in the Weights and Measures Act of 1824, and it was retained until the UK joined the European Economic Community in the 1970s. Some imperial measurements are still in use, such as the pint which is still a popular measure of volume today in British pubs.

The Système International d'Unités (SI Units)

In 1960, the Système International d'Unités (SI) was adopted to ensure a practical system of measurement. It established the use of seven SI base units:

metres (m) - a measure of length

​kilograms (kg) - a measure of mass

seconds (s) - a measure of time

amperes (A) - a measure of electric current

kelvins (K) - a measure of thermodynamic temperature

​moles (mol) - a measure of the amount of substance

candelas (cd) - a measure of luminous intensity

Such developments have emerged due to the growing need in the 20th and 21st centuries to ensure an open, transparent and comprehensive system of metrology that would provide the technical basis for wider agreements negotiated in science, trade, commerce, and regulatory affairs.

Initially, metrology emerged as a scientific system of calculation from a natural basis to pre-empt the subsistence needs of growing populations. Since antiquity, it has progressed to become to a universal language within science, industry and commerce, to permit the continuing enlightenment and advancement of humankind, as well as the distribution of knowledge and resources across the international stage.

New Metrology

The National Physics Laboratory (NPL) is the UK's National Measurement Institute which specialises in understanding metrology and helping people reduce uncertainty of measurements. The NPL believes that metrology for the 2020s needs to develop to be useful to society in the 2020s. It is focusing on four elements including:

The Quantum SI - As a result of a new quantum SI, several of the base units of measurement need to be revised and redefined to remove any remaining physical artefacts. The will allow for taking advantage of the advances in quantum metrology.

Measurement at the frontiers - Advances in science and technology are pushing the frontiers of what is possible for metrology.

Embedded and ubiquitous measurement - Metrology capability will be embedded at the heart of products and systems in an example of technological convergence.

Smart and interconnected measurement - Large-scale, multi-measurement systems will exploit the availability of networked information to be able to make use of the 'internet of things', where physical objects integrate into the global information network.

During an interview with Hong Kong television station TVB on May 10, Chen Guo Jing, a commercial and residential property developer based in Melbourne, spoke out in a report titled 'Mainland Invasion' about the growing amount of Chinese investment in Australia.

Mr Chen, who has been living in Australia for 27 years, reportedly said: ‘Australian treat Chinese with contradicting attitude.

‘However, Australia can’t survive without us. Therefore, Australian keep the anti-Chinese resentment to themselves.’

Chen Guo Jing spoke to Hong Kong based television station TVB about Chinese investment in Australia

‘Why? Luxury housing and expensive cars are all bought up by us Chinese. Mineral and energy resources are all bought up by us Chinese. If there were no Chinese, Australia couldn’t survive,’ he said.

The TV report, which has reportedly gone viral in China and has been condemned by some Chinese Australians, also said that ‘one in seven Mainland Chinese tycoons, that is 10 million, want to emigrate’ to Australia.

Reporter Melissa Gecolea's report for TVB aimed to show how 'the Chinese diaspora is impacting life in Australia where mainlanders now top the list of foreign investors in real estate, driving prices up'.

The show's blurb on the TVB website says: 'The Pearl Report went to Sydney and Melbourne to see how Chinese mainlanders live and work down under and in particular their investments in the property market.'

One Facebook comment on the video from a Canadian Aaron Lee said: 'This is also happening in Vancouver as well. I don't think I can ever afford to buy my own house.'

He planned to study for two years but set up his own supermarket after being granted political asylum after the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre, TVB reports.

After starting his successful supermarket business he branched out into property and is now the director of CBD development group.

The TVB report said during 2013-2014, among the 190,000 new migrants in Australia about 26,000 were from Mainland China which is the second largest source.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Chen and the CBD development group for comment.

According to his company website, he is currently building an apartment complexes in Brunswick, Chadstone, Doncaster and on the South Bank.

In April, it emerged China has became Australia's biggest source of approved foreign investment for the first time.

It came after a $12.4 billion influx on real estate in the last fiscal year.

For the first time, Chinese investors who planned to spend $27.7 billion overtook the United States investors who were approved to spend $17.5 billion.

This week Credit Suisse forecast that over the next six years Australia will see $60 billion in new Chinese investment in Australia's housing market.

This is more than double the $28 billion influx over the past six years, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

On May 2 the government announced plans to strengthen the foreign investment framework.

Tresurer Joe Hockey and Prime Minister Tony Abbott said they will ensure stronger enforcement of new and existing foreign investment rules by transferring all residential real estate functions to the Australian Taxation Office.

'The ATO will use its data-matching systems to identify possible breaches and the Commonwealth will pursue those foreign investors who break the rules,' Mr Hockey said.

68,68,FL-2015-000057-CHN,DDoS botnet makes slaves of your home and office routers - ZDNet,https://www.zdnet.com/article/ddos-botnet-makes-slaves-of-your-home-and-office-routers/,"Symantec

A massive DDoS botnet made up of a slave network of hijacked home and office routers has been revealed.

According to a report released by cybersecurity firm Incapsula on Wednesday, lax security practices concerning small office and home office (SOHO) routers has resulted in tens of thousands of routers becoming hijacked -- ending up as slave systems in the botnet network.

Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are a common way to disrupt networks and online services. The networks are often made up of compromised PCs, routers and other devices. Attackers control the botnet through a command and control center (C&C) in order to flood specific domains with traffic.

This, in turn, can overwhelm a service, causing websites to effectively turn down legitimate traffic under the onslaught. DDoS attacks are also occasionally used as a distraction while a threat actor uses other methods to break into corporate networks.

Several dozen Imperva Incapsula customers were recently targeted by a DDoS botnet comprised of hijacked routers through a series of application layer HTTP flood attacks. The attacks were first detected in December last year, and the company has been mitigating the flood ever since. However, in the last 30 days, attacks have risen to a new height with double the number of attacking IPs than previous records.

After investigation, Incapsula discovered the attacks on domains the company monitors were only a small part of the bigger picture -- a far larger DDoS botnet assaulting ""hundreds"" of other domains outside of the Incapsula network. In addition, attack vectors beyond application layer HTTP flood attacks are being used and include network layer barrages.

However, what makes this botnet special is its reliance on SOHO routers, which are predominantly ARM-based Ubiquiti devices.

ISPs, vendors and users themselves -- who do not lay down basic security foundations such as changing default passwords and keeping networks locked -- have likely caused the slavery of ""hundreds of thousands [...] more likely millions"" of routers now powering DDoS botnets which can cause havoc for both businesses and consumers, the firm says.

While it is not known exactly how many SOHO routers are part of the newly-discovered botnet, Incapsula researchers found that all of the units were remotely accessible via HTTP and SSH on their default ports -- and on top of this, ""nearly all are configured with vendor-provided default login credentials.""

Incapsula believes that new devices are added to the network through the execution of shell scripts which seek out devices with open SSH ports which can be accessed using default credentials.

As a result of these poor security practices, threat actors which have compromised these routers could potentially eavesdrop on communication, perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, hijack cookies and gain access to devices connected to the local network.

After analyzing 13,000 malware files, the researchers determined that the victim routers were all compromised through variants of the MrBlack malware -- Trojan.Linux.Spike.A -- as well as Dofloo and Mayday, all previously used for DDoS attacks. However, the researchers believe several groups or individuals are pulling the strings, and new malware types are constantly being added.

Between December 30, 2014 and April 19 this year, Incapsula recorded attack traffic from 40,269 IPs belonging to 1600 ISPs worldwide, as well as at least 60 C&C centers. The majority of compromised routers, 85 percent, are in Thailand and Brazil. However, the majority of C&C centers are within China and the United States, at rates of 73 percent and 21 percent respectively.

Attack traffic has been traced from 109 countries.

The new botnet is similar to hacking group Lizard Squad's DDoS for hire scheme. The Lizard Stresser is a DDoS botnet, reportedly also making use of slave routers, which can be hired for as little as a few dollars. However, while Incapsula's botnet uses Spike to compromise devices, Lizard squad relies on Linux.BackDoor.

Prior to publishing their findings, the cybersecurity firm contacted the router vendors and ISPs ""found to be most open to abuse."" Router owners are urged to disable all remote access to their router management platforms and change their login credentials.

Fortescue boss calls Australians to oppose BHP, Rio iron ore plans - MINING.COM - MINING.com",https://www.mining.com/its-war-fortescue-boss-calls-australians-to-oppose-bhp-rio-iron-ore-plans/,"In an editorial written for News.com, the head of the world’s No.4 iron ore mining company said BHP and Rio were jeopardizing the economy, accusing them of “callous disregard for Australia.”

The billionaire philanthropist said that because of the reckless actions of the big iron miners he was now “being forced” to lay off more than 100 workers a day in his own company.

“These big companies say they must flood the market next year and the year after and the year after even though it will crash the price further,” Forrest wrote. “Every time they say this the price falls again.”

Forrest argues that for every dollar lost the economy loses A$800 million ($632m) and the government misses another $300 million ($235m) in company tax revenue. He said funding for everything from education to superannuation is, this way, being put at risk and his own work to boost universities and end Aboriginal disadvantage is being hurt.

He continued his aggressive call-to-arms buy asking Australians to bombard their local members of parliament and question if BHP and Rio should be allowed to even operate in the country.

Dangerous intervention

Reactions to Forrester’s renewed attack on the big miners, as expected, were quick to come. The Minerals Council of Australia said Forrest was playing a “dangerous game” by pushing for the federal government to intervene.

“There is no role for government in ‘managing’ the iron ore market,” the industry group chief executive, Brendan Pearson, said in a statement.

He added a move like that would give “a giant free kick” to Australia’s competitors, such as Brazil. “And one thing we know from commodity markets is that once given up, market share is very difficult to win back.”

However, Treasurer Joe Hockey has backed Forrest’s call, saying he has some sympathy for him.

“I have a lot of sympathy for the workers who are losing their jobs and I’ve got a lot of sympathy for a number of companies that have suspended activities as a result of the fall [in prices],” he told Financial Review.

Fortescue, Australia’s third biggest iron ore producer, is not an innocent victim in this ongoing war. The company has also contributed to oversupply, recently ramping up production to 164 million tonnes a year.

But at a dinner in Shanghai earlier this year, Forrest said he was “absolutely happy” to cap his production right away and that the other major players should do the same. His comments granted him a probe by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on whether he had breached cartel laws.","Mon, 11 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fortescue-metals-boss-demands-iron-ore-output-cap.jpg,"['plans', 'ore', 'calls', 'million', 'forrest', 'workers', 'bhp', 'rio', 'company', 'say', 'sympathy', 'war', 'big', 'fortescue', 'iron', 'boss', 'market', 'oppose']", 
71,71,FL-2015-000057-CHN,Investigation: Does the UK’s biomass burning help solve climate change? - Carbon Brief,https://www.carbonbrief.org/investigation-does-the-uks-biomass-burning-help-solve-climate-change,"In the name of tackling climate change, the UK has become the largest importer of wood pellets in the world in just five years.

The UK’s demand for wood pellets is set to break five million tonnes this year and perhaps 10 million within a few years, fuelling a growing global trade and vociferous debate between energy firms and NGOs.

Accounting methods mandated by government show burning wood in place of coal is shaving millions of tonnes off UK emissions, yet NGOs say separate government research shows the opposite.

So, does the UK’s growing use of biomass for power generation help solve climate change or not? Carbon Brief guides you through the dense thicket of debate in search of answers.

Biomass Britain

Ten years ago, just 1% of the UK’s energy came from renewable sources. In 2007, Tony Blair signed up to an EU-wide 20% by 2020 goal, having reportedly mistaken the target for energy as one that covered electricity only. After Blair left office this EU target was divided up among member states, with the UK agreeing to a 15% by 2020 domestic goal for renewables.

The government set out its approach to meeting this challenging goal in its 2009 UK Renewable Energy Strategy. This said the UK would “ramp up the supply and use of biomass for heat, power and transport while ensuring sustainability and protecting the environment”.

By 2013, the UK was getting 5% of its energy needs from renewables, of which bioenergy supplied about a third. Some of this comes from landfill gas and waste incineration, but a large part comes from biomass electricity, where wood pellets are burnt to generate power. It is quick and relatively cheap to convert existing coal-fired power stations to burn biomass with or instead of coal. These plants can also run around the clock, unlike wind turbines or solar panels.

The potential for further biomass expansion remains large, potentially providing 14-21% of the green energy needed to meet the UK’s 2020 target, according to the UK’s Renewable Energy Roadmap, which sets out the contributions that could be made by different sources.

Imports fuel the UK’s biomass needs

The problem with ramping up UK biomass electricity generation is that the UK’s forests don’t produce enough wood to meet demand. Official figures show UK woodlands produce around six million dry tonnes of sawn logs, wood panels and wood pulp or paper each year. The UK produces only 0.3 million tonnes of wood pellets and briquettes.

The UK’s power plants burnt 3.4 million tonnes of wood pellets in the 2013/14 financial year, up from less than 0.2 million tonnes in 2009/10. That’s why the majority of the UK’s biomass for electricity is being imported. The world’s top three wood pellet exporters in 2013 were the US, Canada and Latvia (graphic below, top left).

This rapid scaling up of UK biomass burning has been the driving force behind a growing global trade in wood pellets, particularly exports from the US. The UK was responsible for 58% of the increase between 2012 and 2013 (graphic below, top right).

As a result, the UK has become the world’s largest wood pellet importer, with a 28% share of the global market (graphic, top centre). It imported 3.9 million tonnes in 2013, an estimated 4.6 million tonnes in 2014 and is expected to import 5.5 million tonnes this year.

The UK is the world’s largest wood pellet importer and its increasing demand is fuelling a growing global trade in pellets. Drax power station, the largest UK user of these pellets, says most of its biomass comes from thinnings and residues. Source: Drax biomass supply report 2014, Ofgem figures and Carbon Brief analysis of UN Food and Agriculture Organization figures. Credit: Biomass in Britain. Rosamund Pearce, Carbon Brief.

The graphic shows other EU countries, notably Italy and Denmark, are also importing wood pellets to burn for power. In total, some 57% of the EU’s 2020 target is expected to be supplied by bioenergy, though most of this will be in the form of heat and transport biofuels rather than biomass electricity.

It is the UK that has led the way on biomass power, however. Just three UK power stations – Ironbridge in Shropshire, Tilbury in Essex and Drax in Yorkshire – burnt almost all the UK’s imported pellets during 2013/14 (chart, bottom right). Ironbridge suffered a fire last year and is expected to close permanently during 2015. Tilbury is hoping to extend its life for another decade.

More biomass power plants are in the pipeline. The 420 megawatt Lynemouth coal-fired power station in Northumberland has secured a government contract to convert to 100% biomass, with an estimated start date of 1 March 2017. The contract would run until 2027 and Lynemouth would require 1.5 million tonnes of wood pellets per year.

The Lynemouth deal is subject to approval from the European Commission, which it is expected to receive subject to some changes. A 300 megawatt biomass plant at Teesside in North Yorkshire has secured commission approval and is expected to start operating in July 2018.

Biomass at Drax

However, the UK’s largest biomass user by far is and will remain Drax, the four gigawatt power plant in Yorkshire which has converted two of its six units to use 100% wood pellets instead of coal.

Andrew Brown, Drax head of communications, tells Carbon Brief the company expects to convert a third unit to use 90% biomass by quarter three 2015, and then 100% biomass by 1 February 2016. If this goes ahead as planned, Drax would need to source around 7.5 million tonnes of biomass per year – more than half of the global trade in wood pellets in 2013.

Drax would, ultimately, like to convert a fourth unit to biomass before 2019. This would increase biomass capacity at Drax to around 2.5 gigawatts and wood pellet requirements to around 10 million tonnes per year. Add in Lynemouth and Teesside and UK demand could reach 13 million tonnes or more.

In summary, Drax is the largest user of imported wood pellets in the UK, its needs are growing fast and the UK, in turn, is the largest importer of pellets in the world.

The Drax biomass conversion is part of the reason the UK’s coal use fell below 50 million tonnes in 2014 to a level not seen since the 1850s. This contributed to a 9.7% reduction in UK carbon emissions in 2014, a record for a year with a growing economy.

Drax’s pivotal position in the global wood pellet sector explains why it has become a focal point for debate about biomass sustainability. For instance, it is the target of the ‘Axe Drax’ campaign organised by NGO Biofuelwatch . In a 22 April open letter to DECC, Biofuelwatch and other NGOs called for an end to the subsidies Drax receives for burning biomass.

Drax biomass sustainability

In February, Drax published a biomass sustainability report for the first time. This says it burnt 1.6 million tonnes in 2013 and four million tonnes in 2014. This means that in 2013 Drax was the fourth-largest pellet importer in the world after Denmark, Italy and the rest of the UK. As noted above, this requirement will increase again in 2015, if Drax proceeds as planned.

Where does all this biomass come from? Mirroring the global wood pellet export leaders in the graphic above, some 58% of Drax’s 2014 crop came from the US (light blue area, below), another 22% from Canada (brick red) and 7.5% from Latvia.

The sources of biomass burnt by Drax in 2014, according to the company’s first ever biomass sustainability report. Charts by Carbon Brief.

The chart above shows that the large majority of the wood pellets burnt by Drax last year came from sawmill residues, forest residues and thinnings, making up 81% of the total. We’ll explore what those categories actually mean in a moment.

Drax says its use of this wood reduced its coal burn by a third and reduced its emissions by six million tonnes of carbon dioxide, equivalent to 1.5% of total UK emissions. It says 122 kilogrammes of carbon dioxide was emitted for each megawatt hour of electricity generated in its biomass units.

This can be compared to coal emissions of around 1,018 kgCO2/MWh and gas at around 437kg. The government has set limits for biomass emissions per megawatt hour of 285kg from 2020, 200kg from 2025 and 180kg from 2030. On this measure, Drax is clearly meeting the limits and also benefitting the climate by increasingly burning biomass instead of coal.

Carbon stocks

The biomass emissions methodology being used by Drax is mandated under UK and EU rules. It includes lifecycle emissions from the cultivation, harvest, processing and transport of wood pellets from the forest to Drax’s plant. But it ignores potentially large changes in forest carbon stocks and indirect effects caused by increased demand for wood products.

In an attempt to fully account for these aspects of biomass harvest, the Department for Energy and Climate Change’s (DECC’s) then-chief scientist Professor David MacKay created the Biomass Emissions and Counterfactual model, or BEaC for short.

Carbon Brief looked at the results of BEaC when it was published last year. The model poses a series of “what if?” questions to explore plausible scenarios for the consequences of increase biomass demand. For example, will demand for wood pellets cause foresters to harvest their trees more frequently? Will pulp be diverted away from paper mills towards pellet plants?

The BEaC report concludes that it is “possible to produce electricity with significant greenhouse gas savingsâ?¦ However, other scenarios can result in greenhouse gas intensities greater than electricity from fossil fuels”.

Good for the climate?

Where does the Drax fall on this spectrum between good wood, and wood that is worse than coal for the climate?

Carbon Brief attempted a basic comparison between Drax sourcing categories and the BEaC scenarios. Sawdust and sawmill residues (chippings and off-cuts) account for 37% of Drax supplies and are, on the face of it, relatively uncontroversial and low-emission sources. BEaC puts emissions at no more than 121 kgCO2/MWh.

If demand from Drax diverts these products from other end uses, however, BEaC says the associated emissions can “vary greatly”. Emissions can be low, at 127 kgCO2/MWh, but, in certain scenarios where displaced demand has knock-on impacts in Brazil can lead to emissions higher than coal of up to 1,761 kgCO2/MWh.

Forest residues, accounting for another 29% of Drax supplies, are a little more complicated. These include branch wood, tree tops and “other low grade wood”, says Drax. Emissions in the BEaC scenarios range from below zero up to 536 kgCO2/MWh, higher than for gas.

The below-zero emissions scenarios are where fine, narrow-diameter woody materials are burnt in a power station instead of being left on the forest floor, where they would rapidly rot and release methane.

Less climate-friendly, according to BEaC, is the use of larger diameter wood that could store its carbon on the forest floor for many years. The Drax sustainability report does not provide enough information to make this distinction.

Most controversial of all, however, is what Drax calls “thinnings”. Matt Willey, head of public affairs for Drax and the firm’s former communications manager, tells Carbon Brief: “A thinning is a whole tree in layman’s terms”, but the reality is more nuanced, he says. It might include misshapen or other low-value timber, he says, such as pulpwood used to produce paper.

NGOs frequently accuse Drax of using whole trees and the term has become an emotive symbol of the alleged ills of the biomass power industry. Drax is at pains to clarify that it isn’t only “some quite large trees”, as it puts it.

In fact, the label is relatively unimportant. Adam Macon, a campaign director for US NGO Dogwood Alliance, tells Carbon Brief: “If biomass policies accurately accounted for carbon impacts of burning wood and set a diameter limit then this definition war would not be an issue”.

More important, according to the BEaC model, is where the wood comes from and what would have happened without increased demand for pellets.

In a briefing paper on Drax and BEaC, Friends of the Earth says the thinnings used by Drax correspond to a set of BEaC scenarios in which harvest rates in naturally regenerating southern US forests are increased, in order to supply increased demand for pellets. Nearly 90% of productive forests in the US are naturally regenerating.

In these BEaC scenarios, the associated emissions are at least three times higher than for coal. The BEaC report scenario assumes increased demand for pellets that would see these forests harvested every 60 years, instead of every 70 years.

Alternatively, they might be harvested every 70 years where the rotation would have increased to every 80 years without the higher pellet demand. Either way, the average amount of carbon locked in the forests is reduced, the BEaC reports says, as increases in the amount of biomass extracted outweigh a boost to forest growth rates.

A fools errand

Willey insists harvest rotation lengths are unaffected by Drax’s demand for biomass. He tells Carbon Brief: “You don’t change rotation for biomassâ?¦ the lowest value product doesn’t dictate the actions of a forester. Ring up one of the big foresters and ask if biomass would affect rotation rates. That would be an insane proposition.”

He also says attempting to calculate the emissions from Drax’s biomass with the BEaC model is a “fools errand”. Willey says many assumptions in the model would need to be adjusted: “If you just change one variable you can get a completely different answer”.

A source close to DECC’s biomass modelling tells Carbon Brief:

“I believe DECC published BEaC hoping that industry would use it. So I think we hoped that Drax would actually map their sources onto BEaC themselves. I think a reasonable question to ask Drax is why won’t you [use BEaC]? What are you trying to hide?”

Drax has not and is not planning to use the BEaC to model emissions associated with the biomass it uses, Willey tells Carbon Brief. He says the BEaC model is “not a very accurate way of measuring carbon changes” in forests and its scenarios are “hypothetical”.

Drax argues it is more important to look at landscape-level forest carbon inventories. In a factsheet provided to Carbon Brief, it says forest areas and standing wood volumes are increasing in the US, partly as a result of “active management” by loggers. It says “forests are growing, not shrinking, in all of the US states that Drax sources from”.

For example, Drax’s Morehouse pellet plant is taking waste wood that used to go to a paper mill, Willey says. The mill closed three years ago and the waste wood had not been going anywhere since then, Willey says: “In many markets, no-one is buying the waste wood.”

He says the local forest “basket” adds 22 million tonnes of biomass each year through new growth, while demand is only 15 million tonnes. This leaves plenty of surplus biomass that can be harvested without reducing forest stocks, he says.

Country-scale forest stocks

This landscape-scale view of forest stocks has an attractive simplicity. Surely, if the amount of carbon locked in US forests is increasing, despite harvest for the likes of Drax, then all must be well for the climate?

US pellet exports to the UK are large, perhaps 3.5 million tonnes this year, according to a January 2015 report from the US Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service. But they remain small compared to the 320 million tonnes of wood harvested from US forests each year. This total is, in turn, around 30% below harvest levels seen in the 1990s, the report says, while 98 pulp or paper plants closed in the US between 1998 and 2003.

A December 2014 report from the US Forest Service offers partial support for this argument. It says forest hardwood inventories are expected to continue increasing out to 2020, even as bioenergy demand increases.

Crucially, however, the report says forest carbon stocks are expected to grow more slowly as a result of EU demand for biomass. It is precisely this sort of relative change in carbon stocks that the BEaC model attempts to capture.

The forest service report says:

“Even assuming full utilisation of mill residues and increased utilisation of logging residues, harvest of pine and hardwood non-sawtimber feedstock increasesâ?¦ hardwood inventories continue to increase [but] end at lower levels thanâ?¦ without new bioenergy demand”.

The report says pellet feedstock prices and forest harvests have already increased in response to the “key driver” of rising demand from EU biomass electricity plants. Increased harvests of naturally regenerating forest correspond to the BEaC scenario most often highlighted by NGOs, where biomass emissions are three times worse than coal.

Genuine carbon reductions?

How likely are these high-emissions scenarios? After all, if true they would totally undermine the reason for paying for Drax and others to burn biomass. As we’ve seen, this is a complex question that seems insufficiently answered by information that’s publicly available.

This is unsatisfactory, given that UK bill-payers are spending hundreds of millions on biomass subsidies. So, DECC is paying £134,000 to consultancy Ricardo AEA to investigate further. The firm will assess the likelihood of the BEaC biomass scenarios, where emissions are worse than coal or gas in a year-long, three-phase project that started in March.

DECC’s specification for the research says:

“UK government is committed to the principle that bioenergy should deliver genuine carbon reductionsâ?¦ This involves on-going monitoringâ?¦ The BEaC model and accompanying report and this projectâ?¦ form part of this”.

It says that Ricardo AEA will be expected to contact existing biomass electricity generators, environmental groups and relevant trade bodies, so they can provide “any evidence that any of the [high-emissions] scenarios are currently happening”.

The project is expected to ask what factors determine harvest rates and whether rotation lengths have, in fact, changed recently. For instance, DECC’s specification asks if the relative price of different forest products is the limiting factor, as Drax argues.

The project also asks if UK demand for biomass might divert pulpwood, thinnings or sawmill residues from other users. It asks whether harvest of southern US pine plantations might occur less frequently without UK pellet demand, and whether “whole trees are used in pellet manufacture [and], if so, what are the carbon stock impacts”.

Conclusion

This DECC research project will report initial findings later this year. Meanwhile, the government is introducing mandatory sustainable sourcing requirements later this year. These won’t please everyone. Richter tells Carbon Brief: “There’s a lot of concerns about how clear the [sustainability] reporting is going to be.”

The European Commission says it will publish a new policy on sustainable biomass during 2016-17. Environmental groups want the commission to cap biomass use, to introduce strong sustainability standards, and to account for emissions from biomass burning within its emissions trading system (EU ETS).

Whatever happens over the next few years, the party for biomass power in the UK will not last forever. At an event in March, Ed Davey, the UK’s energy and climate secretary, questioned whether the UK should be adding more biomass electricity. He said the best research showed there was “good biomass and bad biomass” and that we had be “a bit more careful than people thought a few years ago”. He added that biomass was only a “transitional” green power source.

As Drax’s Willey explains, the firm has to recover its investments by 2027, when biomass power subsidies are due to end. Until then, we need to know how much of the UK’s burning biomass is helping the climate. If most of it isn’t, the experiment should be cut short.

Here’s what we know so far: Good biomass includes fine woody residues taken from forests instead of burning it at the roadside, or leaving it to rot. Burning sawdust and sawmill residues is good for the climate, too, unless rising pellet demand indirectly drives deforestation in countries like Brazil.

Bad biomass includes extracting larger pieces of woody residue rather than leaving them to decompose slowly on the forest floor, which might be no better for the climate than gas.

The worst biomass of all would be if the surge in UK demand for wood pellets sees US forests harvested more frequently than they would have been otherwise. Evidence from the US government suggests this is already happening, and the climate impacts could be worse than coal.

Drax has taken the commendable decision to publish its sourcing data. Yet its refusal to use the BEaC calculator, along with grey areas between pellet sourcing definitions, make it impossible to decide if the weight of biomass burning is good wood for the climate, or bad.

72,72,FL-2015-000057-CHN,Chinese Agriculture Minister enjoys Georgian wine tour - Agenda.ge,https://agenda.ge/en/news/2015/1046,"The Agriculture Minister of the People’s Republic of China, Han Changfu, spent an enjoyable day delighting his taste buds in Georgia’s famous wine region Kakheti during his official visit to Georgia.

Changfu arrived in Georgia yesterday to meet Georgia’s Agriculture Minister Otar Danelia and discuss a joint agricultural project.

Today Changfu and a Chinese delegation visited the Alaverdi Monastery complex where they visited a wine cellar and saw beekeeping activities.

Monastery Wine is a millennium brand of the Alaverdi Monastery Cellar made by the Alaverdi Monastery congregate in an 11th century cellar. The wine is produced by an endemic variety of Kakhetian vine in unique clay vessel – qvevri – that is traditional to Georgia. The Alaverdi Royal Monastery is historically known for its qvevris and cellar.

The guests also visited the facility that produced Badagoni wine and the Gvirabi tourist complex.

Additionally, the Chinese guests visited a local farming family in Tsinandali village. There, Changfu saw a 135-year-old grape vine that has been growing in this family.

The local family offered the Chinese Agriculture Minister a taste of their homemade Georgian wine, which he sampled from a traditional Georgian drinking horn vessel.

Acording to the latest data revealed by the Georgia's National Wine Agency, from January to April 2015, China also experienced an 87 percent increase in its import of Georgian wine.

In recent times Georgia has made an effort to penetrate the Asian wine market, and results were now becoming evident, said the Agency. This could further be backed up as exports of Georgian wine increased by 9 percent to Japan so far this year.","Sat, 08 Dec 2018 20:09:04 GMT",https://agenda.ge/files/news/040/chineseminister.jpg,"['chinese', 'georgias', 'visited', 'georgian', 'georgia', 'alaverdi', 'changfu', 'minister', 'tour', 'agriculture', 'enjoys', 'wine', 'monastery']",

A tornado touched down in Iowa and was heading toward Lake City on Sunday evening. The town of about 1,700 is about halfway between Des Moines and Sioux City.

Texas and South Dakota also experienced tornadoes, as well as heavy rainfall and baseball-size hail, and thunderstorm warnings splashed across much of the Midwest.

A tornado came to Denton, Texas, on Sunday afternoon, though no injuries have been reported. It did not directly damage any structures, although it caused some trees to fall on homes, according to the Denton Police Department.

Throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth area, a tornado watch will remain in effect until 9 p.m. local time, according to the National Weather Service. One person was killed Saturday when a tornado hit Eastland County, about 130 miles west of Dallas.

“We’re looking at more storms into the evening and we’re asking people to remain on watch. Just keep tabs on the weather and look for alerts,” said Matt Stalley, a meteorologist with the weather service in Fort Worth.

The storms also brought flooding -- notably in Krum, Texas, a few miles northwest of Denton, where some people climbed onto their roofs as waters rose.

Flash flood warnings are to remain in effect in parts of north-central Texas into Monday morning. “The flooding will be a persistent problem with the thunderstorms,” Stalley said.

Flash flood warnings and watches also covered swaths of Oklahoma and Arkansas on Sunday night. “The worst flooding will occur in areas that have already seen 8 to 10 inches of rainfall over the past few days,” cautioned the NWS office in Tulsa, Okla.

A separate tornado went through Delmont, S.D., on Sunday morning, damaging more than 20 buildings, according to the NWS. According to local media, Gov. Dennis Daugaard said nine people were hurt, none severely.



The tornado traveled more than 17 miles and had winds that reached about 130 mph, the NWS said.

Residents of Delmont were asked to leave town for safety reasons, South Dakota Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Kristi Turman told the Associated Press. According to the 2010 census, about 230 people live there.

We’re still waiting for Avengers: Age of Ultron’s first-day totals from China, where it opened at midnight on 12 May. Its global box office stands at $875.4m after the weekend, and there’s no doubt it will join the $1bn club. But given a pretty hefty 60% drop in the States this frame, there’s still speculation about whether the Marvel film has the legs to pass the original’s $1.51bn total and become the third-highest grosser of all time. The optimistic take: post-Furious 7, the Chinese are Hollywood-drunk, and Ultron benefits with another $400m sweep. The US total winds up around $500m, and adding the $562.4m already taken overseas, the sequel is within spitting distance of a new Marvel high. The pessimistic: most developed markets seem a touch cooler than first time around; and noticeably, Ultron is clocking in lower than Furious 7, this year’s film to beat, at the same third-weekend stage, even with the latter’s Chinese figures removed (it was a fraction below $1bn). We await the news from Beijing …



Mismatched buddies

Same stereotypes, fresh occupants: in Warner Bros’ new $35m comedy Hot Pursuit, Reese Witherspoon is the uptight cop, Sofia Vergara the hot-tamale druglord’s wife. It’s the latest attempt to forge a duo to capitalise on female-fronted comedy’s post-Bridesmaids viability. US reviewers, though, deemed the pairing a failure – “cautious and tentative in pursuit of laughs”, reckoned the New York Times – and the $13.3m opening there suggests that audiences did, too. That’s well below the $39.1m for 2013’s The Heat, which hooked up Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy for something comparable, and disappointing for proven comic actor Witherspoon, whose Legally Blonde opened in the $20m range over a decade ago. With 82% of the US punters over 25 and 46% over 50, the PG-13 Hot Pursuit seems to have played it too safe, and doesn’t have the R-rated edginess of the McCarthy comedies that pulled in a younger crowd. The $35m budget, a typical, generous mainstream spend on a comedy, is going to be tough to claw back, but some of the small overseas markets that opened this week offer a glimmer of hope. The UAE take ($429k) was above that of The Heat ($295K), while Singapore was about level ($121K to The Heat’s $120K). Witherspoon’s 20-year comedy pedigree should count for something globally, when the film expands in the coming weeks, while you’d expect the Colombian-American Vergara – not a big-screen draw, but with massive recognition factor from ABC series Modern Family – to have some Latin American impact. But with New Line, MGM and others contributing to the costs, Warner is fortunate that it hasn’t got too much riding on the untested duo.



Rebel yell

Rebel Wilson isn’t top-lining movies yet, like fellow plus-size Bridesmaids graduate Melissa McCarthy. But she clearly has powerful localised star pull in her native Australia, where a cappella girl-group comedy Pitch Perfect 2 has just opened in full voice with $7.6m – surpassed only by the more blockblustery Age of Ultron, Furious 7 and Fifty Shades of Grey this year, and three times better the first film. Oz was the top oversea territory then, too, so it’s easy to attribute the success to Wilson: her character, Fat Amy, is given as much prominence in the trailer as the more conventionally ditzy Beca, played by the film’s nominal star Anna Kendrick. Maybe it’s time for Wilson’s trademark flat-keyed insolence to be given a bigger remit outside of an ensemble? With another $1.2m from the New Zealand debut, the second Pitch Perfect is off to a much more promising start than Hot Pursuit, ahead of its global bow proper next weekend: 27 territories, as well as the US. The sequel takes the time-honoured route of sending its likely lasses abroad, to a Copenhagen a cappella competition, where the Barden Bellas learn the true depths of anti-American feeling; presumably, Universal are not only expecting progress on the original’s $113m worldwide, but also a shift away from its 57.5% US split towards the overseas side.



Home … and away

We noted right from the off that Dreamworks’ cuddly alien-invasion animation Home lived up to its name, box office-wise, by performing well in the US. But how, after a so-so start, has it developed abroad? It’s proved a steady little performer, sticking in the top 10 since its late-March release and creeping up to $180m overseas gross; enough, with its $342m overall haul, to put the $135m animation well into profit. It’s not an earth-shattering performance, compared to the likes of Disney’s $652.1m-earning Big Hero 6 last year, which was far more overtly streamlined for international appeal. But it is a steadying tick on the “hits” side of the ledger for Dreamworks Animation, which hasn’t had too many of late, having kept pace with Big Hero 6 in the UK ($33.9m and counting) and Russia ($17.2m), and playing respectably in most big territories. Now creeping into the chart of the top 50 CGI animations of all time, it’s notable not only for being the first with a black protagonist, but also for being a rare original offering in a 20-year-old medium increasingly staffed by sequels and spinoffs. Universal’s Despicable Me offshoot Minions joins Penguins of Madagascar in the latter category, in something of a lull year, before a flood of sequels to the big digi-franchises in 2016 and 2017. After Home, only Pixar – with both June’s inner-emotion-anthropomorphising Inside Out and November’s alternative prehistory The Good Dinosaur – is attempting the tricky business of starting from scratch this year.



The rest of the world

The Chinese May Day hits outlined last week – campus romance Silent Separation and Hong Kong thriller Helios – plus the Korean crime drama China Town were still hanging around as the non-Hollywood representatives on the global chart this frame. Not listed but also worth flagging up is Bollywood drama Piku, which built impressively throughout the weekend to pull in $3.9m in India alone, enough to have put it at least 13th worldwide. A big-hitting intergenerational trio of actors – Deepika Padukone as an architect on a road trip with her crotchety father (Amitabh Bachchan), and Irrfan Khan as the taxi-company owner caught between them – was eye-catching enough. But the film didn’t bother with the usual Bollywood promotional star-jumps, and let an unusually sharp and plain-spoken family drama, directed by Shoojit Sircar (who made 2012 sperm-bank comedy Vicky Donor), do the talking. Job done.



The future

Next up in the summer-blockbuster convoy is Mad Max: Fury Road; George Miller’s 1970s and 80s post-apocalyptic outbursts now transmogrified, after 30 years’ absence, to full global-franchise proportions, with Tom Hardy replacing Mel Gibson on brooding-and-intense duties. It will be hitting the asphalt in 70 markets, reserving just Brazil and Japan for later in the year, but will Miller’s jacked-up operatic chutzpah – currently receiving rapturous notices – strike a chord with a new generation of fans? Or is this, budgeted at $150m and with the not-yet-bankable Hardy behind the wheel, actually a risky undertaking? Elsewhere, as mentioned above, China should be contributing heartily to the Ultron coffers by next weekend, and Pitch Perfect 2 is expanding into the US, UK, India, Russia and much of Europe. And on the Bollywood front, one of India’s most interesting directors, Anurag Kashyap, releases Bombay Velvet, his 60s-set, noir-mythologising attempt to do for the city what James Ellroy has done for Los Angeles. This is the man who managed to make Jharkhand coal-mining sexy in 2012’s awesome Gangs of Wasseypur, so expectations are high.

J. A. A.

There isn’t a soul in sight at four in the afternoon in the streets of Torre de Juan Abad, in the heart of Spain’s La Mancha region. In this village of 1,100 inhabitants in Ciudad Real province, the only activity now going on is taking place inside the bar at the local seniors center.

The locals are trickling in for a cup of coffee, and when asked if they know anything about a group of minerals called rare earth elements (REE), they look puzzled and shrug. In a place where people just barely scrape a living from agriculture, nobody knows what their village has to do with iPhones, global geopolitics, or the trade wars between China, the European Union, the United States and Japan.

Europe should concentrate on one or two mines and on recycling a lot”

Christopher Ecclestone, Hallgarten & Company

But it has a lot to do with them. A Spanish company named Quantum Minería is planning to open a mine near here and extract REEs, a category that encompasses 17 chemical elements used to make hi-tech equipment ranging from computers to television sets, wind turbines and hybrid car batteries. Some of these minerals are also used to produce the magnets that make iPhone loudspeakers vibrate, powering their sound.

Most of the 110,000 tons of REEs produced annually in the world come from China – 86 percent in 2014 – giving it an enormous commercial edge that borders on outright monopoly.

Europe still lacks an open-pit REE mine, although there are a few projects in the pipeline. The one in Ciudad Real is modest in terms of size – it is expected to yield 20,000 tons of rare earth oxides with 10,000 further tons likely – but it stands out above the rest because of its high levels of praseodymium, neodymium and europium, three of the most coveted elements.

A geopolitical weapon

For years, Western powers lived off Chinese supplies with reasonable ease. But that was until 2010, when Beijing began using REEs as a geopolitical weapon, imposing strict export restrictions based on the argument that it was concerned about the industry's environmental impact. The deplorable state of the area around the city of Baotou, in northern China, is a good example of this: besides extraction, the region also processes the minerals, which is the most polluting part of the process. As a result, entire populations have had to be relocated because of air, earth and water pollution.

China managed to reinforce its tech industry’s position, and even got Japanese companies to move there to ensure supply. At one point Beijing threatened to cut off sales to Japan if Tokyo did not release the captain of a fishing vessel caught near Senkaku, an uninhabited island that is claimed by both countries.

The conflict ended in January when the World Trade Organization ruled in favor of Japan, the US and the EU, all of whom had filed a complaint against China. But by then the plaintiffs were already running scared. The US was additionally worried about its arms industry, as REEs are used for missiles, and the US government was investing in the search for alternatives to rare earth elements. In 2010, it reopened a large open-pit mine at Mountain Pass, California.

The area around Torre de Juan Abad may be rich with rare earth minerals.

Meanwhile, new mines have cropped up in Australia and Vietnam. The EU has placed these products at the top of its strategy to ensure access to critical raw materials, and it wants to develop a plan to exploit mineral deposits in Europe under the EURARE funding program.

“There are potential rare earth element resources across Europe,” says British geologist and EURARE member Kathryn Goodenough. “Although the best-known ones are in Greenland and Scandinavia, there are many other areas under exploration, including Spain.”

Most experts cite the Norra Karr project in Sweden as the one that holds the most promise. This and the Ciudad Real site are at the most advanced stage.

The Spanish company Quantum Minería is now in the process of requesting an exploitation license, said sources familiar with the situation. Although the final area will be a lot smaller, the investigation phase surveyed thousands of hectares located between Torrenueva (population 2,900) and Torre de Juan Abad. Olive trees figure prominently on land that is used chiefly for agriculture, with the odd game preserve tucked in between the crops and the pastures, and a local cheese factory.

But in Torre de Juan Abad, which boasts an illustrious past – Baroque-era writer Francisco de Quevedo was exiled here in the 1600s – nobody knows anything about any mining project.

“I haven’t heard anything, and everyone drops by here,” says José Antonio, standing behind the bar at the seniors center.

The response is similar in the nearby village of Torrenueva, where several groups of retirees are sitting in the main square across from the 16th-century church. The men insist on talking about the antimony mine that shut down over seven decades ago, but seem to know nothing about a new one. Neither do local authorities, according to the municipal secretary.

We would love it if a mine opened up here”

José Luis Rivas, mayor of Torre de Juan Abad

But the Socialist Party mayor of Torre de Juan Abad, José Luis Rivas, is aware that an investigation project is underway and approves wholeheartedly.

“We would love it if a mine opened up here,” he says. “This is a very depressed area that lives exclusively off agriculture and has fewer and fewer jobs to offer. The young people have moved away. So if they were to create some steady jobs, even if it weren’t that many... That said, they would have to respect all environmental requisites.”

Environmental concerns tend to be one of mining’s great enemies – especially when it comes to REEs, which have such a bad pollution record. The Mountain Pass mine that reopened in the Mojave desert in 2010 had shut down 12 years earlier when it was discovered that an underground pipe was leaking out radioactive water.

Low radioactivity

There are indeed radioactive elements among the group of 17 minerals, including thorium and uranium. The Quantum project says the Ciudad Real site contains very small amounts of the former and nearly residual amounts of the latter. Also, the company in theory wants to make a rare earth concentrate, rather than separate the elements, which is much riskier.

“The challenge is to find ways to exploit those resources in a way that is viable from an economic and an environmental standpoint,” says British geologist Goodenough. She adds that many rare earth sites have “relatively low radioactivity” and thus do not present “major environmental problems” beyond the fact that an open-pit site is a visual blot, uses up a lot of water to make the concentrate, and produces waste that needs to be properly disposed of.

This field could become an open-pit mine if Quantum receives its exploitation license. J. A. AUNIÓN

Two years ago, a project to research rare earth elements in the Galician mountains of Galiñeiro, in Pontevedra province, came to a halt because of technical difficulties and local opposition from a group that wanted the area to be declared a protected natural site.

But Goodenough believes that the greatest barrier to ensuring a supply of rare earth metals in Europe is making the mines profitable. The problem is that, no matter how crucial these elements may be for the continent, the prices are set by the ups and downs of the stock market and the supply-demand balance. And as a result of the fact that Chinese restrictions were eventually compensated for with new mines in other countries, increased recycling, and the use of alternative materials, prices are at rock bottom.

Projects of this nature require heavy investment, notes Christopher Ecclestone, a mining expert at New York-based investment bank Hallgarten & Company. “Europe should concentrate on one or two mines and on recycling a lot,” he adds.

Meanwhile, the Ciudad Real project – described as “promising” by Canadian analyst Ryan Castilloux – is trying to become one of these major European REE sites. Even in the best of cases it will still take time, since the paperwork can take anywhere between one and three years. By then, though, it is unlikely that residents of Torrenueva and Torre de Juan Abad will still not have heard about the “rare earth” surrounding their village.","Tue, 12 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/U4NPxB95OOfhsb9e5VT6w9i1rSo=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-eu-central-1-prod-prisa.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3PFRWZLRPBVZAPBYARQK5XOMJI.jpg,"['ciudad', 'mining', 'rare', 'rees', 'real', 'torre', 'elements', 'la', 'modern', 'quantum', 'round', 'earth', 'juan', 'mancha', 'metals', 'world', 'abad']",

Because Axel Hathorne, former chief of police and one of their own, has taken a step closer to becoming the city’s first black mayor next month.

Alicia Nowell has been campaigning, and is waiting for a bus to take her home, when she notices the sound of an engine idling down the deserted, dark street. “She couldn’t tell the make or model of the vehicle, but it was the height and width of a van, or a truck of some sort. Run. Just run. It was a whisper inside her own skull, her mother’s voice actually, calling her home.”

Attica Locke first introduced readers to lawyer and former black power activist Jay Porter in her impressive debut, Black Water Rising. Shortlisted for the Orange prize in 2010, it saw Jay dragged into a murder investigation and powerful corporations’ dirty dealings.

In Locke’s dazzlingly good third novel, Pleasantville, Jay is older, sadder, lacking in energy – his wife, Bernie, died a year ago, he’s a single parent to a 10-year-old and a 15-year-old, and he’s planning to retire once he gets the money out of one final class action suit. “A trial he can’t do”, though. “He just doesn’t have it in him any more.”

Alicia’s disappearance, however, sparks an interest – Jay doesn’t understand why the police aren’t linking it to the recent disappearances of two other girls, whose bodies were found exactly six days after they went missing. When Neal Hathorne, nephew of political candidate Axel and grandson of Pleasantville’s unofficial “mayor” Sam Hathorne, is accused of her murder, Jay reluctantly finds himself representing him, and trying to unpick just how much involvement Sandy Wolcott, the current district attorney of Harris County and the white woman who is running against Axel, has in the accusation.

Locke is juggling a lot in Pleasantville – a dirty election, a girl’s disappearance, the mysterious harassment of Jay himself, his own reluctance to… well, be around at all. “Jay wouldn’t wish this life on anyone, the nights he sits in his backyard, staring up at the sky, wanting, stars and all, to pull the whole thing back like the lid of a tin can, anything to see his wife again.”

She pulls it off with panache, whether it’s detailing the logistics of single parenthood, and managing to find childcare while in the middle of a murder investigation, or bringing her cast of characters to vivid life with small, unobtrusive brush strokes.

It takes Locke just a line to detail the misery of Alicia’s mother in a way that’s hard to blot out – “She keeps rubbing her hands along the front of her thighs and rocking back and forth in the chair, her body moving on memory, old muscles aching for the child she once rocked in her arms” – or to make real, unsentimentally, the tragedy Jay’s children are facing daily. Houston, too, is depicted in all its shades of grey, its crime problem “as much a part of its cultural identity as its love of football and line dancing, barbecue and big hair”.

It is wonderful to see Jay, her “rabble-rouser [turned] lawyer with a conscience”, again, and to see him where he belongs, “stirring shit the fuck up”, as his friend and investigator Rolly tells him. Here’s hoping he’ll be back soon: Locke is a seriously impressive writer.

A hazardously placed Jilin “sidewalk” which went viral online has, in fact, turned out not to be a sidewalk at all, but an isolation belt that was merely taken over by pedestrians, reports China Daily.



The supposed sidewalk made waves after pictures emerged of pedestrians following the narrow trail and getting perilously close to the speeding cars and trucks flying past.



Unflustered travellers seem totally impervious to the danger as they traverse the highway.

The two metre wide concrete path is enclosed by four lanes of highway traffic and stretches over a kilometre long.



As it turns out, the median strip is actually an isolation belt intended to divide the opposite directions of traffic, according to the city’s construction committee.

However, it appears that the planning department didn’t anticipate the mettle of local pedestrians, or the risks some Chinese are willing to take for a shortcut.

The intrepid pedestrians who ventured along the “footpath” may be forgiven for their misapprehensions, with regard to the existence of other terrifying and even life-threatening walkways which are found across China.
