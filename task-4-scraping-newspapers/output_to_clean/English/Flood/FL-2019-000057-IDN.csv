Floods in three provinces in Sulawesi have forced thousands of people to flee their houses for higher ground.

Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) revealed that 4,198 people in North Konawe regency in Southeast Sulawesi had been evacuated to safer areas.

""Asera district is the worst effected, with 13 of its villages inundated. Seventy two houses have been washed away, while thousands of other houses are inundated and hundreds of hectares of rice fields, corn fields and fish ponds have been damaged,"" Sutopo said in a press release made available to The Jakarta Post Monday.

Besides areas in Southeast Sulawesi, he said the floods that began at the beginning of June following torrential downpours had also left villages in South Sulawesi and Central Sulawesi under water.

The local disaster mitigation agency (BPBD) has documented damages to public facilities such as bridges, roads, houses of prayer and health facilities.

In neighboring Konawe regency, a 4-month old baby died during the flood, although the BPBD is still investigating whether the death was caused by the flood.

Meanwhile, the BNPB also said 1,452 families had been affected by the floods and 200 houses had been inundated in South Sulawesi, with 3,676 hectares of rice fields destroyed in 15 villages.

In Central Sulawesi, 561 families in Lele and Dampala villages were evacuated after floods damaged a bridge and inundated 45 houses.

The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) has warned of the potential for heavy rainfall in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Maluku and Papua between June 11 and 15.

Several areas in Samarinda city, East Kalimantan, remained flooded on Monday, forcing thousands to flee their homes to seek refuge. Flooding has been affecting the city since Sunday, hampering residents' activities and paralyzing parts of the city.

The flooding was triggered by a rise in water level at the Mahakam River, which flows along Samarinda city. The city lies along the river, 48 kilometer from the river’s mouth.

Heavy rains poured for several hours on Sunday morning, causing the water level to rise at Benanga Dam at the upstream of Karang Mumus River, the confluence of the Mahakam River.

The Samarinda administration has applied an emergency protocol for seven days to assist 10,300 people affected by the flooding

Even after the rain stopped, the water level in several points of the city such as Jl. Dr. Soetomo and Jl. Ahmad Yani remained high.

Samarinda city secretary Sugeng Chairuddin said people in Bengkuring, Griya Mukti, and Gunung Linggai had been the most affected.

People are being moved to safer ground by a team consisting of personnel from the Samarinda and East Kalimantan Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD), the police, military and volunteers.

Heavy traffic also occurred on Jl. PM. Noor due to the inundated roads. Many motorcycles broke down after the riders forced the vehicles to ride through the flooding.

BANGKOK, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Heavy downpours has been hitting Bangkok for more than two hours on Friday, paralyzing the Thai capital's traffic.

The Bangkok Flood Control Centre of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration reported a downpour and strong winds on Friday afternoon, causing floods and traffic jams.

Many key roads of the city have been inundated. Strong winds have also reportedly uprooted trees and knocked over power poles. Some busiest districts of the city had the most rain at 96 millimeters, reports said.

Photos posted on social media showed some cars parked in the Rama 9 area, one of the city's central business district, were submerged up to the passenger seat level.

Thailand has entered the rainy season since May.

Bangkok has been overtaken by heavy rains every year thanks to poor water drainage system and road infrastructure. The city built on once-marshy land about 1.5 metres above sea level, always has to face flooding and traffic congestion in rainy season.","Sat, 08 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",,"['rainy', 'winds', 'brings', 'city', 'yanvideo', 'flooding', 'congestion', 'bangkok', 'downpours', 'strong', 'xinhua', 'traffic', 'heavy', 'season']",

The rains, which started on 28 May, have already claimed the lives of four people, while thirty more are injured. UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, is rushing aid to the area.

Many have been forced to move in with relatives, while others are sheltering in makeshift sites, such as schools and other community structures.

Rising floodwaters have caused severe material damage. Several main roads are blocked and damaged. Ghat’s only hospital has been flooded.

The telecommunications network has been disrupted for days. In some areas, houses and crops have been destroyed. People reliant on their farmland as their sole source of income are set to face major challenges ahead.

All 20,000 of Ghat’s inhabitants are now in need of humanitarian support. Shelter, food and basic items are urgently needed.

UNHCR has immediately dispatched core relief items including family tents, mattresses, blankets, drinkable water, kitchen sets, solar lanterns, plastic sheets and clothes for an initial 400 families.

The aid has been loaded on to trucks and is now en route to Ghat. It is expected to arrive by road later today (Friday, 7 June 2019).

UNHCR’s local partner, LibAid, is on the ground and has made preparations to receive the relief items and swiftly organise distributions to the affected population.

Further rainfall, albeit of reduced intensity, is expected in the coming days, worsening the challenges and risks.

UNHCR’s response is being carried out together with the Libyan authorities, UN agencies and other humanitarian partners as part of the Emergency Cell activated by the municipality of Ghat.

Although the village did not suffer any damage, the people are completely isolated as the destruction of bridges has cut them off from the main road network. As a result, the doctor has not been able to come from the nearest health centre, as he has done so weekly before the floods. Children cheerfully welcome the MSF team as they arrive, while people begin to gather in front of the health post awaiting for consultations. Each week, the team goes to Paran Parvis to provide medical consultations, along with a midwife who monitors pregnant women.

Since roads were destroyed by the floods, the people who live, already quite isolated, in this mountainous area now have even more difficulty to move around. This affects mainly elderly people. In other villages, families have lost their home and all their belongings, and cannot not afford to go somewhere for medical care. So the free of charge healthcare MSF provides is a welcome relief for many.

The team sees many elderly people, especially women, with chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes. People are also treated for upper respiratory tract infections and general pain, while the midwife is quite busy with a number of pregnant women.

Since early May, a mobile clinic has gone to five villages, where the access to them is often difficult and lengthy. To get to the villages of Vareh Zard and Khersdar Softla, the team uses a pedestrian crossing over the river.

Further down on the river’s right bank, Baba Zayd is a village that has been completely ravaged by the waters. The remnants of the health post are filled with mud and debris. The local authorities have installed containers to replace this health facility and a school which was also destroyed, but they lack qualified staff and basic drugs. MSF installed a mobile clinic, set up in a container, to provide medical care to displaced people living in tents.

While the overall situation is slowly improving, some people remain vulnerable while others still do not have access to ordinary health care. Our teams are committed to providing care while communities recover and are continuing to assess the needs in the area.","Thu, 06 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.msf.org/AssetLink/vpkihh510q3vd16682n5ut4u48l3a73a.jpg,"['village', 'medical', 'care', 'vulnerable', 'welcome', 'team', 'msf', 'quite', 'lorestan', 'providing', 'health', 'womensince', 'floods', 'villages']",

JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A column of thick ash was spewed seven km high to the sky from the crater of Mount Sinabung volcano in Sumatra Island of western Indonesia on Sunday, the country's national volcanology agency said.

Belching of ash and smoke was shot at 16:28 p.m. Jakarta time, followed by a spread of hot ash to the southeast and south of the crater by up to 3.5 km and three km respectively, the agency said in a statement.

The agency, however, said there was so far no report of damages or casualty.

Mt. Sinabung volcano is at the second highest alert level with no-go zone of five km from the crater, it said.

Residents living near the flank of the volcano were urged to use masks when rains of ash pour down, spokesman of national disaster management agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.

Those living alongside the rivers with upstream in the slope of the volcano were warned of cold lava floods during torrential rains, the spokesman told Xinhua in a text message.

Mt. Sinabung, 2,475 meters high, is located in Karo district of North Sumatra province. In its eruption in 2014, 16 people were killed and thousands displaced.

ADEN, Yemen, June 9 (Xinhua) -- At least three people died in Yemen following heavy rains and flood that struck several parts of the country's southern and eastern provinces over the past few hours on Sunday.

An Aden-based security official told Xinhua that torrential rains, lightning and high winds also caused a number of injuries in addition to blocking main roads in Aden and other neighboring provinces.

""Two death cases were reported in the southern city of Aden and another in the southeastern province of Shabwa as a result of floodings caused by heavy rains,"" he said on condition of anonymity.

Civil properties including cars were damaged and many houses in Aden's neighborhoods were submerged as a result of the heavy rains that continued for hours, he added.

In the neighboring southern province of Lahj, local media said the rain water mixed with sewage in the city's neighborhoods are threatening the lives of residents as they may suffer from spread of diseases and epidemics.

Yemen's National Meteorological Center warned of ""continuing turbulent weather,"" explaining in its daily bulletin that heavy rains with high winds may continue to hit the southern coast and the adjacent areas.

The center warned the Yemeni citizens ""to take the necessary precautions from the flow of floods, low visibility and sea waves disturbance.""

Earlier in the day, Yemeni Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik ordered the local authorities to immediately deal with the damage and consequences caused by the heavy rains and flood flows in Aden Province.

According to the state-run Saba News Agency, Abdulmalik urged more efforts to ""mitigate the repercussions and damage of heavy rainfall in Aden.""

Meanwhile, Yemeni Minister of Local Administration and Chairman of the Higher Relief Committee, Abdul-Raqib Fath, called for the international humanitarian organizations operating in the war-torn Arab country to provide urgent assistance for people affected by the heavy rains.

Yemen has been locked in a civil war since the Shiite Houthi rebels overran much of the country militarily and seized all northern provinces, including the capital Sanaa, in 2014.

Saudi Arabia has been leading an Arab military coalition that intervened in Yemen's conflict in 2015 to support the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi after Houthi rebels forced him into exile.

The prolonged military conflict has aggravated the suffering of Yemenis and deepened the world's worst humanitarian crisis.","Sun, 09 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",,"['provinces', 'killed', 'hit', 'caused', 'aden', 'yemen', 'rains', 'eastern', 'local', 'xinhua', 'heavy', 'southern', 'yemeni']",

JAKARTA: Indonesia has long considered moving its capital Jakarta, a low-lying city on the northwest coast of the island of Java.

The idea has been floated since the days of the first president, Sukarno, who declared the country’s independence from the Dutch colonial rule in 1945.

President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, recently elected for a second term, seems serious about moving the capital.

He has visited several possible locations in Kalimantan in Indonesia island of Borneo. The country’s Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) have also revealed that moving the capital has been included in the nation's 2020-2024 National Development Plan.

The government argued that Jakarta is overburdened by population growth. Moving the capital will reduce the development gap between Java and other islands. But, as an observer in urban and rural issues, these reasons to move the capital is weak.

IMAGINATION OF AN EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT

Data from the Country’s Statistics Agency in 2018 shows economic activity in Java has contributed 58.5 per cent of Indonesia’s gross domestic product (GDP).

Meanwhile, the eastern part of Indonesia, which includes Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Maluku and Papua, and covers 64 per cent of the nation’s total area, contributes only 16.8 per cent of GDP.

This situation has not changed much since 2010.

The government argues that moving the capital out of Java will support equitable development in eastern Indonesia, but this alone will not be enough.

To support growth in less developed areas the government needs to distribute more new centres of growth and economic opportunities, chiefly to eastern Indonesia.

While the government’s 2015-2019 Development Plan have included policies to create these new growth centres, we’ve yet to see how the policies have been implemented.

CENTRAL INVENTION CAN'T SOLVE JAKARTA'S PROBLEM

Research on decentralisation has shown that regional development has the potential to reduce poverty and inequality. Decentralisation allows the emergence of new economic growth poles such as Bantaeng (South Sulawesi) and Banyuwangi (East Java).



But, in its effort to support villages, the central government often carried out rushed interventions and did not consider the diversity of context and local needs, studies have shown.

File photo of the city skyline in Jakarta, Indonesia. (Photo: AFP/Bay Ismoyo)

The government should avoid creating the impression that all problems can only be overcome by central intervention.

The idea that moving the capital will solve inequality is centralistic and runs against the spirit of equitable development.

CONTRADICTION IN ITS MOVING PLANS

The second reason the government uses to support its plan to move the capital relates to Jakarta's population and environmental pressure. The capital has been considered unconducive for the government.

Bappenas argues that Jakarta, due to urbanisation, continues to experience population pressure.

Earthquake, floods and water shortages threatens the capital. Jakarta's river is heavily polluted. Traffic congestion in Jakarta has resulted in economic losses, reaching 56 trillion rupiah (US$3.8 billion) per year.

It also argues that moving the capital will reduce Jakarta’s burden as the new capital city will be designed as a government centre and separate from the business centre, a concept similar to in Australia, with Canberra and Sydney, and Malaysia, with Putrajaya and Kuala Lumpur.

However, it is important to know that they government activities contribute to only 10 per cent of the capital’s burden. This makes the government's argument weak.



Moving the capital seems like an attempt to escape the chronic problems in Jakarta that need to be addressed immediately. Activities in Jakarta will be paralysed if its problems are left unattended and this will disrupt the Indonesian economy where 70 per cent of the country’s money circulation occurs in Jakarta.

Indonesia also aims to make Jakarta a centre of global business.

But to become a global city, a city must be home to international-scale activities, such as being a financial centre, global tourism destination, have international organisation offices, and host of world events. Cities such as London in England, Tokyo in Japan, and Paris in France are some examples.

Meanwhile, the new capital, which will only carry out government functions, so will not be effective as a new growth centre.

PROBLEMS WITH DATA TRANSPARENCY

Bappenas, which is responsible for Indonesia's plan to move the capital, has never actually publicised its study of the capital transfer to the public.

As a result, many parties question the urgency of the plan, and even see it as an attempt to distract from other issues during the election campaign.

Before arguing about the right location for the new capital city, Indonesia must be sure that the decision to move the capital has been supported by evidence and a comprehensive analysis of its implications.

Otherwise, they'll risk repeating the same mistakes and creating problems in the new capital.

The UN refugee agency reports heavy flooding has forced more than 2,500 people to flee their homes. It says the torrential rains, which began nearly two weeks ago have ravaged the town of Ghat, killing four people, including three children and injuring more than 30 others.

The UNHCR reports the rising floodwaters have caused huge material damage, cutting off main roads and telecommunication networks for days. Agency spokesman, Charlie Yaxley says Ghat’s only hospital is flooded.

“All 20,000 of Ghat’s inhabitants are now in need of humanitarian support. Shelter, food and basic items are urgently needed…Many have been forced to move in with relatives, while others are sheltering in makeshift sites, such as schools and other community structures…In some areas, houses and crops have been destroyed and people reliant on their farmland as their sole source of income are set to face major challenges ahead,” said Yaxley.

Yaxley says the UNHCR is rushing aid to the area including family tents, mattresses, blankets, drinkable water, plastic sheets and clothes for 400 displaced families. The Libyan Red Crescent reportedly is carrying out search and rescue operations for people trapped by the flooding.

Ghat is located near the Algerian border and some 1,300 kilometers south-west of the Libyan capital, Tripoli. It is controlled by independent Tuareg forces. The town reportedly has been taken over by rebel commander Khalifa Hafter, who is waging war against Libya’s internationally recognized government in Tripoli.

The Libyan National Army, led by Hafter, began a march on Tripoli two months ago to seize control of the city and the government. In the lead up to this military operation, the LNA claimed it had taken the south western towns of Awainat and Ghat without a fight.

The legitimately recognized government in Tripoli has declared Ghat a disaster zone and provided more than seven million dollars to help the flood victims.

Libya’s rival internationally unrecognized eastern-based interim government, which broadly supports Hafter, reportedly is sending truckloads of emergency supplies to Ghat.","Sat, 08 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-06/libya.png,"['reports', 'reportedly', 'town', 'devastating', 'tripoli', 'libyan', 'taken', 'southwest', 'libya', 'flee', 'agency', 'unhcr', 'floods', 'thousands', 'ghat', 'hafter']",

Mount Sinabung, which has seen a spike in activity since 2010, erupted for around nine minutes on Sunday, sending clouds of volcanic ash 7 km (4.4 miles) into the sky.

Although no casualties were reported, officials monitoring the volcano warned of possible fresh eruptions.

""After the eruption, from midnight until 6 a.m., there were a few aftershocks,"" said Willy, a scientist at a Sinabung observatory post, who uses one name, like many Indonesians.

Authorities left unchanged the alert level for Sinabung, but urged residents to use face masks and keep indoors to guard against volcanic ash fall.

Mount Sinabung, which is 2,460 m (8,071 ft) high, is among Indonesia's most active volcanoes, but had been inactive for four centuries before its 2010 eruption.

This causes loss and damage of US$40 billion annually. According to the UN’s Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, between 2002 and 2012, 700,000 people died, more than 1.4m were injured and about 23m were made homeless as a result of such disasters.

In Bangladesh, some 45m people live in areas where extreme cyclones frequently destroy homes and livelihoods. After interviewing a woman there who lost a child in a flood and was then abandoned by her husband, I wanted to address the problem practically. And that is how Dream Homes, the Dundee University project that has just won the UN’s prestigious Risk Award, was born.

In communities that are vulnerable to storm disasters, people have few choices. They are not willing to abandon their homes and move to emergency shelters because they risk losing their livelihood, although often they have no choice if everything is destroyed. Disasters also restrict access to food, water, electricity, and other necessities.

So our plan was to design resilient floating homes that would enable families to survive in the aftermath of extreme flooding while producing food, water and energy, and also provide sustainable ways to make a living.

Douglas Vercohl/GRP , Author provided

Prototypes and partnerships

We designed and built three 196m2 prototype homes for US$12,000 each in the pilot phase of the project, which was funded by the Global Resilience Partnership in conjunction with the Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Research (C3ER) at BRAC University in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Crucially, the homes were co-designed by local people in an inclusive effort to empower disadvantaged families. All through the design and construction process we held workshops to find out what people needed most in home that would not sit on land. For adults this included a central “courtyard” space, for example, and for children, a space to play in. Through close collaboration we were able to make the best use of local materials and integrate traditional building methods with our own technologies and innovations. This input not only improved the structural designs but ensured a sense of ownership of the project in local people afterwards.

Each home was built over a 40-tonne buoyant platform which acts as a raft, allowing the house to rise vertically above floodwater by sliding on two guideposts. The structure can withstand category three cyclones, medium-level earthquakes and riverbank erosion.

The homes have the capacity to hold 17,000 litres of fresh drinking harvested from rainwater which can supply the domestic water demands of a family for six months. There is room to keep chickens in an enclosure and vegetables can be grown vertically in soil pouches, and in an aquaponic system without soil, so that an income can be earned through selling eggs and produce.

An innovative sanitation system called a bio-digestor converts all the waste from the kitchen, toilet and chicken coop to generate methane gas that can be used for cooking fuel. So the home doesn’t pollute the surrounding environment, and good standards of hygiene can be maintained.

Poverty and vulnerability

The desolate woman who lost her child made me understand how risk evolves from multiple climate disasters and extends suffering through a series of knock on effects. But the problem is not actually risk, but rather the inability to manage risk.

Poverty erodes people’s ability to adapt to multiple risks in their lives. Plus diminishing natural resources and social and economic inequalities all serve to increase their vulnerability. Our flood-resilient homes are designed to help people find ways to manage the risks of sea-level rise, storm surge and salinisation (when saltwater intrudes on inland water and soil).

Douglas Vercohl/GRP , Author provided

These homes will allow people to continue making a living after a flood with adequate access to food, water and energy – the things that enable communities to think beyond immediate survival, continue to make a living and utilise resources to improve their situation.

Above all we understood from our discussions with local people that this should be a home – not a house. Home equals safety, family, the place that provides security, a sense of identity and belonging, and a feeling of pride. For the future we plan to use the €100,000 prize money to bring the project to scale in the flood-prone river basins and deltas of Bangladesh. And we will continue our research to bring the cost down by half, making these sustainable and affordable homes even more accessible to rural communities all around the world.","Fri, 31 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/277407/original/file-20190531-69091-14ignth.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['countries', 'project', 'homes', 'risk', 'extreme', 'food', 'water', 'vercohlgrp', 'help', 'local', 'continue', 'disasters', 'floating', 'floodprone']",

The flooding is breaking some weather records, and at least 38 people have been killed by tornadoes in the United States so far this year.

Blame climate change?

Scientists have been studying possible links between climate change and the frequency and ferocity of tornadoes.

Villanova University professor Stephen Strader says it is not yet clear how much influence the warming atmosphere and other changes have on these deadly storms.

In a VOA interview, the extreme weather scientist said, ""We're not there from a scientific standpoint, yet."" He said it does seem likely, but not certain, that we will see more severe weather of various kinds in the future.

Flooding

National Weather Service (NWS) meteorologist Andy Foster in Kansas City, Missouri, says there has been ""major record flooding"" across much of the central U.S.

He told VOA that heavy snow cover melted and combined with large amounts of rain from ""multiple storm systems"" saturated the ground and caused river flooding. Foster said when still more major storms brought ""copious amounts"" of rain, there was nowhere for the water to go, sparking flash floods in several states, inundating roads, towns and farmland.

Storms that led to flooding also included an unusual flurry of tornado activity.

Tornadoes

U.S. records show that destructive and deadly twisters are common during the spring months, particularly in an area called ""Tornado Alley,"" which covers several Midwestern states. The midsection of the United States is where cold air from the Rocky Mountains collides with warm, moist air flowing up from the Gulf of Mexico -- prime conditions for tornadoes to form.

The mixture is part of the complex recipe for compact but powerful storms that tear roofs off buildings, toss huge trucks across farm fields, uproot trees and shred multistory brick buildings, all of which produce flying debris that can kill people.

Research scientist Harold Brooks says clusters of tornadoes occur every five or 10 years, but ""the second half of May is going to go down as one of the busiest two-week periods on record.""

In a phone interview from the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma, Brooks said the clearest trend in the data is not more or stronger tornadoes, but more days each year with multiple storms.

Villanova professor Strader said scientists currently have a hard time predicting tornadoes even ""a few hours before the event,"" so making projections about how many deadly storms may erupt years or decades from now is a daunting task.

Saving lives

As the annual death toll from tornadoes dropped significantly from the 1920s to the 1990s, the value of predicting violent storms has become more apparent. Brooks and other experts say lives have been saved through better forecasting, improved building codes and more effective warnings.

Strader said those improvements ""stalled out"" in recent years, prompting officials to seek better ways to educate the public and communicate timely, effective warnings. He said some people stay in mobile homes and other vulnerable places even after they get warnings in time to move to shelter.

As a start, weather experts are teaming up with social scientists to craft warnings that people will heed to find safety, either in a sturdy building or other safe place, Strader said.

""We're bridging the physical science with social scientists to really look at what we can do to continue to solve this tornado issue,"" he said.

Tens of thousands of protesters paralysed central Hong Kong on Wednesday, blocking major roads in a defiant show of strength against government plans to allow extraditions to China.

Black-clad demonstrators, most of them young people and students, surrounded government offices, bringing traffic to a standstill as they called on authorities to scrap the Beijing-backed plan.

Rows of riot police were far outnumbered by protesters -- many of whom wore face masks, helmets or goggles -- just hours ahead of a scheduled debate in the city's legislature.

By late morning, with crowds continuing to swell, officials in the Legislative Council (Legco) said they would delay the second reading of the bill ""to a later date"".

In scenes echoing the Occupy movement in 2014 that shut down swathes of the city for months, people flooded major roads and junctions in the heart of the city, dragging barricades onto highways and tying them together. Some plucked loose bricks from pavements.

Police used water cannons and pepper spray on protesters outside the Legco building and held up signs warning demonstrators they were prepared to use force.

Organisers of a gigantic march on Sunday said more than a million people turned out to voice their objections to the proposed law, which would allow Hong Kong to send suspects to other jurisdictions around the world -- including China.

But the record numbers have failed to sway pro-Beijing chief executive Carrie Lam, who has rejected calls to withdraw the bill.

Many opponents are fearful the law would entangle people in the mainland's opaque courts, leaving them vulnerable to a justice system seen as acting at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party.

More than 100 Hong Kong businesses said they would close Wednesday in a sign of solidarity with the protesters, and the city's major student unions announced they would boycott classes to attend the rallies.

A string of other prominent unions in the transport, social work and teaching sectors either followed suit or encouraged members to attend while a bus drivers' union said it would encourage members to drive deliberately slowly to support protests.

""It’s the government who has forced people to escalate their actions, so I think it's inevitable for the fight this time to get heated,"" said protestor Lau Ka-chun, 21.

- 'Hong Kong's children will hurt' -

Overnight, a group of around 2,000 protesters held a vigil outside the government offices, with some singing hymns.

Hardline protesters had on Sunday made similar plans to spend the night but were prevented by police, who fought running battles with small groups of demonstrators.

Throughout Tuesday evening, police flooded the area around the government offices, stopping and searching many young people as they arrived in the area.

Lawmakers were to debate the bill on Wednesday morning in the city's legislature, which is dominated by Beijing loyalists. A final vote is expected on June 20.

""The only responsible thing to do now is for Carrie Lam to withdraw the evil bill, or at least to shelve it in order to solve the crisis,"" said pro-democracy lawmaker Fernando Cheung.

""Because the situation is very tense, if she forces it through and asks the police to use violence, I’m afraid Hong Kong’s children will be hurt, will bleed.""

Hong Kong's leaders say it is needed to plug loopholes and to stop the city being a sanctuary for fugitives, and that safeguards are in place to ensure that political critics of Beijing will not be targeted.

But many Hong Kongers have little faith in the government's assurances after years of heightened fears that a resurgent Beijing is trying to quash the city's unique freedoms and culture.

A 50-year agreement between Hong Kong's former colonial ruler, Britain, and China theoretically means the city is guaranteed freedoms of speech and assembly unseen on the Chinese mainland.

The pastor of a usually pro-government mega-church issued a statement saying he could not support the bill while the Catholic diocese urged Lam -- a devout Catholic -- to delay the bill.

Western governments have also voiced alarm, with the US this week warning the bill would put people at risk of ""China's capricious judicial system"".

Beijing hit back on Tuesday, with a foreign ministry official saying China ""resolutely opposes interference in Hong Kong affairs"".","Wed, 12 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2019/06/12/2019_06_12_74206_1560310689._large.jpg,"['kong', 'bill', 'hong', 'extradition', 'protests', 'city', 'offices', 'china', 'major', 'lam', 'paralyse', 'kongs', 'citys', 'protesters']",

Further north in Iowa, a flood barrier along the swollen Mississippi River failed Saturday, flooding four to six blocks of downtown Burlington, a city of about 25,000 people that is 170 miles (274 kilometers) southeast of Des Moines.

On Friday, the Arkansas River, which has been flooding communities for more than a week, tore a 40-foot (12-meter) hole in a levee in Dardanelle, a city of about 4,700 people roughly 100 miles (160 kilometers) upstream from Little Rock.

Officials say the levee breached early Friday at Dardanelle, about 60 miles northwest of Little Rock.

?Last ditch effort

Mayor Jimmy Witt said Saturday that officials don’t believe a temporary levee being constructed will stop the water from flooding the south side of Dardanelle, but he hopes it will buy time for residents of up to 800 threatened homes to prepare.

“We have started a last ditch effort to try and protect the southern borders of the city,” he said at a news conference.

The river has been widening the levee breach and floodwaters have been slowly approaching homes, officials said. Water from some creeks and tributaries has flooded some houses, they said. Yell County Judge Mark Thone said flooding has surrounded about 25 people in a rural community a few miles south of Dardanelle, and several roads have closed because of high water.

Arkansas neighborhood evacuated

Meanwhile in North Little Rock, which is just across the Arkansas River from Little Rock, officials were going door-to-door Saturday to tell people in the Dixie Addition neighborhood to consider leaving.

The river isn’t expected to crest in the Little Rock area until Tuesday, but North Little Rock officials said on Facebook that they believe the river will back up storm drainage areas and cause roads to become inaccessible in and around Dixie Addition, possibly for more than a week.

City spokesman Nathan Hamilton said there are about 150 homes covered by the evacuation recommendation. He said other homes also could be affected by flooding, but officials were focusing on only the most pressing neighborhood.

The evacuation recommendation followed a false alarm overnight that a nearby levee had breached and that flash flooding was possible. Officials quickly reversed themselves, though, and said that it hadn’t failed and wasn’t in danger of doing so.

Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Friday that officials were working to identify higher-risk spots in the Arkansas River’s levee system.

“Obviously the breach in Dardanelle is a sign that there could be more of these breaches that will happen as the pressure continues to mount in the coming days,” Hutchinson said.

?Flooding sets records

Record-breaking flood levels in Fort Smith, Arkansas’ second-largest city, remained steady through the morning, with the National Weather Service predicting the water would begin to recede Saturday night into Sunday morning.

The Arkansas River isn’t the only one causing problems in the region.

In Burlington, Iowa, officials confirmed that a large, sand-filled barrier failed Saturday afternoon, forcing some businesses in the downtown area to evacuate. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the area until 10 p.m. Saturday.

Parts of the tiny northwestern Missouri town of Levasy were under water Saturday after a levee breach along the Missouri River. Officials there were conducting water rescues by boat, but no injuries were reported.

Illinois begs people to flee

Officials in Illinois issued an “urgent plea” to residents of river communities to prepare for potential evacuations. The state’s Emergency Management Agency director, Alicia Tate-Nadeau, called flooding a “life-safety issue,” and the agency said levees along the Illinois River were in critical condition.

Flooding along the Missouri River in central Missouri prompted officials to issue a mandatory evacuation order Friday for some residents of Howard County, where the river had topped a levee. A topped levee along the Mississippi River, in northeastern Missouri, flooded several thousand acres of farmland Thursday.

Meantime, tornados have torn up swaths of several U.S. states in the past few weeks, and floodwaters have wreaked even more damage.

Across the U.S. and elsewhere, tornados, flooding and fires have destroyed homes, sometimes entire communities. Victim after victim describes the trauma.

Preston Black in Oklahoma says a tornado threw his trailer home several meters into the air. His parents, wife and children were all inside. Then, he saw his wife in the debris.

“To see her like that. ... It was awful,” he said. “The worst thing I could ever see.”

She survived. But they lost everything they had.

Police stand at the ruins of a hotel in El Reno, Okla., May 26, 2019, following a likely tornado touchdown late Saturday night.

​​Hurricane Michael

Last October, Hurricane Michael destroyed entire towns in Florida. Some people are still living in tents. Janelle Crosby lives in a trailer home full of health hazards.

“Rats. Critters. It’s disgusting. Mold. This they put up to try to contain the mold. It was pink, it’s now black.”

Natural disasters affect everyone differently. In California, Gwen Oesch found that the immediate impact of loss can’t always be anticipated.

“I didn’t realize how much my home means to me,” she said, with a sigh.

Solace in numbers

When a community is hit by a disaster, it can be less traumatic than an individual disaster like an accident, according to Dr. John Lauriello, a psychiatrist at the University of Missouri Health Care.

“I think there’s a shared understanding of the trauma, which I think can be very, very helpful because people feel like it wasn’t just them. It occurred to their community and, therefore, the community is going to work together, and the rebuilding will happen together.”

In Missouri, universities are housing people whose homes were destroyed by massive flooding and a tornado. Darrell Bonner says he’s grateful for a place to stay.

“It’s a blessing living here. A lot of financial burden has been let loose a little bit. There’s hope. There are people out there willing to help,” he said.

WATCH: Natural Disasters Take Psychological Toll on Survivors

​​Crosby says in her Florida community, people share whatever they have.

“We just all take care of each other. It’s hard, but like I said earlier, if one of us has generator gas, or if we have propane, we all get to cook that night. If not, we get out here and make fires on the grill and cook.”

For children, routine key

Psychiatrist Laine Young-Walker at the University of Missouri Health Care says the sooner parents can get their children back into a normal routine, the better off they will be.

“They thrive in and survive on structure and routine,” Young-Walker said. “So when a natural disaster like this happens and they get displaced, they’re not in their home anymore, their school is closed, they’re not able to go to the school. They don’t have that structure. They don’t have that routine and that consistency. And it can cause a lot of stress for them.”

If schools are destroyed, Young-Walker suggests finding ways to do class work.

Last year, a teacher turned her California home into a classroom when her students’ school was destroyed by fire. Eight-year-old Eleanor Weddig thought it was better than school.

“I love it. It’s like more comfortable than our classroom, the chairs are cushy, that’s one thing that I like. And anyway it’s a house so it’s, like, more fancy and stuff and she cooks us great lunches. Like every lunch I love,” Eleanor said.

with consideration paid to the vernacular architecture of the region, the design by SAOTA intends not to impose on the landscape, but instead to create a balance between the built form and the natural environment. with this in mind, the floors are constructed over several levels, in tune with the contours of the site. upon reaching the house, a wide set of steps greets residents, proudly announcing the entrance to the building. once inside, the scheme is defined by the large open spaces that make up the program. expansive glazing and semi-outdoor areas characterize the home, resulting in a direct relationship being forged with nature and a very contemporary style of living.

the construction of ‘uluwatu house’ has used local materials where possible, in order to create an architectural expression that relates to the context. large plains of stone make up the primary structure of the building, with sections of vertical timber cladding also used, almost resembling the palm trees that line the garden. glass is also utilized throughout the project to create the feeling of transparency between spaces while additionally functioning to provide picture-perfect views of the ocean. the final, and perhaps one of the most important materials, is the vegetation. lush greenery can be found not only in the garden areas, but in the entire building, resulting in an architecture that intends to immerse residents in the serenity of nature.

The three men and two women were paraded at a police news conference in the Bali provincial capital, Denpasar, days after being arrested.

They were arrested between May 20 and 24 in the tourist hotspot of Kuta, said Denpasar police chief Ruddi Setiawan.

He said the arrests began when police caught a 33-year-old Russian man, identified only as Nikita, arranging cocaine sales by phone to foreign tourists.

Police seized 20.18 grammes of cocaine and 44.14 grammes of marijuana from the group.

""We are still investigating how they got that cocaine and marijuana,'' Setiawan said. ""We believe they are part of an international syndicate and got the drugs from abroad.''

Police identified the 31-year-old American suspect as Ian. A Russian woman, 31, was identified as Maria and a Spanish woman, 33, as Laura. A 37-year-old Spanish man identified as Juan had operated a restaurant in Kerobokan near Denpasar for a long period of time, police said.

Indonesia has strict drug laws and dozens of convicted smugglers are on death row. Its last executions were in July 2016, when an Indonesian and three foreigners were shot by a firing squad.

“An estimated 5.4 million people are likely to be food insecure by July. Some 2.2 million of these will be in severe conditions needing immediate emergency assistance unless aid is urgently scaled up,” Baloch said during a press briefing in Geneva.

He noted that those who were already driven out their homes due to conflict and violence are disproportionally affected by the drought.

Last year, weather-related hazards such as storms, floods, and droughts displaced 16.1 million people worldwide, according to UNHCR. More people are expected to be displaced in the future as extreme weather conditions become more common.

Somalia’s latest drought came on the heels of the 2016-2017 drought that led to the internal displacement of over a million people.

“UNHCR and humanitarian partners fear that severe climatic conditions combined with armed conflict and protracted displacement could push the country into a far bigger humanitarian emergency,” Baloch said. “Decades of climatic shocks and conflict have left more than 2.6 million people internally displaced.”

On May 20, aid agencies launched a Drought Response Plan to avert a humanitarian crisis. Under the plan, 794,000 people will get protection-oriented assistance and support. The agencies are appealing for $710.5 million to provide help to the Somalis, but to date, it is only 20 percent funded, UNHCR said.","Tue, 04 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://theglobepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-04-at-11.03.46-AM.png,"['conflict', 'forces', 'displacement', 'search', 'somalia', 'homes', 'displaced', 'food', 'conditions', 'water', 'flee', 'baloch', 'unhcr', 'humanitarian', 'drought', 'thousands', 'million']",

Sumatra’s Mount Sinabung volcano erupted for nine long minutes on Sunday, sending volcanic ash more than four miles (7km) into the sky. Although no casualties were reported, residents nearby were urged to use masks when ash rains down and those living along the rivers upstream were warned of cold lava floods during rains. Mount Sinabung has seen a spike in activity since 2010, and officials are warning of potential further eruptions.

Is it safe to travel to Indonesia? The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) hasn’t placed any specific trail restrictions on the island of Sumatra, but advises against all travel to within four miles (7km) of the crater of Mount Sinabung in the Kalo Regency. There is an exclusion one in the region due to the high threat of volcanic activity, and the FCO says if you’re in it, “you should leave immediately”. The travel advice says: “There are many active volcanoes in Indonesia, any of which can erupt with little or no warning.

“This often results in the evacuation of villages within a three to seven-kilometre radius and disruption to air travel in the wider region. “In the past, repeated eruptions have caused destruction and fatalities. “Check media reports before travelling to areas that are prone to volcanic activity.” Scientists monitoring the volcano said there were aftershocks following the eruption, and more may follow.

The national park surrounding the enormous canyon -- the second-most visited US national park, after the Great Smoky Mountains in the country's southeast -- has experienced a distressing surge in fatal accidents, with at least four visitors dying in as many weeks in March and April.

The views that draw millions to the park in the high Arizona desert are stunning, to be sure, both in their rich earth hues and in the sheer immensity of the gap cleaved over eons by the unceasing Colorado River as it winds sinuously through the canyon bottom.

But the views can also distract or disorient visitors -- some of whom take risks despite park rangers' constant warnings -- and the result can be fatal.

The body of a Japanese tourist was the first one found this spring, located in a wooded area some distance from the rocky cliffs.

Then came three fatal falls, including that of a fifty-something tourist from Hong Kong who toppled over the edge while snapping photos.

The park has placed protective barriers at some popular vista points, but ""we don't want to put barriers everywhere,"" park spokeswoman Kris Fister told AFP. ""The specialness about parks is not being enclosed.""

""You don't have a barrier between you and this amazing place,"" she added, ""but you have to pay attention.""

""We tell people to stay on the designated trails and walkways and to keep a safe distance from the rim"" -- and of course, to pay attention when taking pictures, said Fister, dressed in the gray military-style shirt and khaki pants of a park ranger.

""That's pretty common sense.""

But at the park's Mather Point, which offers especially scenic views not far from the visitor center on the canyon's South Rim, the message does not always get through.

This natural vista point, the most heavily visited in the park, may be the spot in the US most often captured in visitors' selfies.

From here to the canyon's North Rim is a distance of 10 miles (16 kilometers).

There are protective barriers. But not far away, a young woman ventures to the very edge of the cliff.

""We can see well enough from here,"" British tourist Kathryn Kelly sniffs dismissively, looking at the risk-taking woman. ""I don't see the point stepping closer to the edge.""

""I heard of a man who died trying to take a selfie, and I'm struggling to feel sorry for him,"" Kelly said. ""It's a kind of natural selection.""

- Heat, suicides, snakebites -

Of the dozen people who, on average, die each year in the canyon, relatively few fall to their deaths, according to park service statistics.

Most deaths are linked to the dramatic change in altitude and to dehydration in the crushing summer heat faced by hikers -- despite the frequent warning signs that say things like ""Don't become a statistic"" and ""Down is optional, up is mandatory.""

But for those who make it to the bottom of the canyon, near the turbulent, muddy waters of the Colorado, Phantom Ranch offers a welcome oasis, a place to rest and spend the night after long, draining hours of hiking.

Among the books on a shelf in the ranch's dining room is one that lists every death registered in the park: ""Over the Edge: Death in Grand Canyon.""

Falls, flash flooding, drowning, storms, snakes, suicides, even murders ... there are as many ways to die in the Grand Canyon as there are ways to photograph (and of course Instagram) it.

Jim Stanley, a 71-year-old from Michigan, read the book before taking on this dangerous wonder of nature, where nearly seven million visitors are expected this year for the 100th anniversary of Grand Canyon's classification as a national park.

""I haven't been discouraged; I'm now aware of the risks,"" he said, his hiking pants proudly held up by a pair of suspenders in the red, white and blue of the American flag.

""Too many people take the Grand Canyon for granted,"" he added. ""But it's not Disneyland.""

There has always been an element of mystery, or mysticism, surrounding the park and its awe-inspiring landscape. The numerous accidental deaths in its vast territory through the years have even given rise to a sort of earthbound Bermuda Triangle vibe.

Two airplanes once collided above the canyon, claiming 128 lives in what, at the time, was the worst commercial aviation accident in US history.

That was in 1956, long before the advent of the selfie.","Mon, 03 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2019/06/03/2019_06_03_73798_1559537307._large.jpg,"['canyon', 'park', 'risk', 'tourist', 'visitors', 'uss', 'dont', 'aweinspiring', 'views', 'selfie', 'offers', 'edge', 'rim', 'beauty', 'grand', 'deadly']", 
34,34,FL-2019-000057-IDN,Your plate of rice is hurting the climate - The ASEAN Post,https://theaseanpost.com/article/your-plate-rice-hurting-climate,"Rice is the staple food of hundreds of millions of Asians and by far the most polluting grain. (Bloomberg Photo)

Eco-conscious consumers are giving up meat and driving electric cars to do their part for the environment, but what about that plate of rice?

Global rice farming, it turns out, could have the same detrimental effect on global warming in the short term as 1,200 average-sized coal power plants, according to the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund advocacy group. That means the grain is just as damaging over the long term as annual carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels in Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom (UK) combined.

As the sheer size of the staple food’s carbon footprint becomes clearer to scientists, companies including the maker of Uncle Ben’s rice and Olam International Ltd., the world’s second-biggest rice supplier, are starting to source more of the grain from farms that aren’t flooded, a widespread cultivation technique that releases methane gas into the atmosphere.

“The amount of attention that rice receives for these issues is relatively small compared to the size of the problem,” says Paul Nicholson, who heads rice research and sustainability for Olam from Singapore. “People are very informed on their chocolate, coffee, hair care solutions, but rice is an afterthought.” Rice is the staple food of hundreds of millions of Asians and by far the most polluting grain — emitting twice as much of the harmful gases as wheat. Yet it hasn’t been in the spotlight as much as, say, beef, which produces far more emissions per calorie and along with other animal products is the culprit behind almost 60 percent of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions coming from food.

That’s changing as socially conscious consumers, especially in Europe and North America, increasingly demand evidence that the foods they spend their money on are doing the least harm to the environment — and treating farmers and workers in developing countries fairly. With agriculture emitting almost as much GHG as transportation, those demands will only intensify.

Alternative methods

For millennia, rice farmers from Spain to Indonesia have relied on the practice of flooding paddy fields because it stops weeds from growing. But there’s a big drawback: submerging the crop allows tiny underwater microbes to decay organic matter, producing methane, a GHG that is 25 times more potent than CO2 even though it lingers in the atmosphere for a shorter time. Growing rice in flooded conditions causes up to 12 percent of global emissions of methane, a gas blamed for about one quarter of global warming caused by humans.

The Sustainable Rice Platform, or SRP, overseen by the United Nations (UN) and the International Rice Research Institute, is trying to promote change. Earlier this year, the Bangkok-based body released updated guidelines on growing rice more sustainably by, for instance, alternately wetting and drying the crop rather than keeping it flooded, not burning what's left of the crop after it has been harvested, using organic fertilisers and promoting fair working conditions.

The SRP is working with thousands of farmers in countries like India, Nigeria, Thailand and Vietnam to give them a score based on these and other factors, with its work funded by corporate members and non-governmental organisations. Rice that complies with the standard will eventually be eligible to carry an “SRP-verified” logo, a certification that will be rolled out later this year—giving consumers a choice for the first time.

Mars Inc., the producer of the Uncle Ben’s brand popular in the United States (US) and Europe, shifted to sourcing 87 percent of its rice under the standard this year, a ratio it expects to boost to 100 percent by 2020. Olam, too, said it’s pursuing initiatives to get farmers to grow sustainable rice in five Asian and African countries.

“We are working with farmers to develop new methods,” said Louke Koopmans, Mars Food’s global sustainable sourcing manager. As an example, she said the company’s work with 2,500 basmati rice farmers in India and Pakistan has reduced water use by 30 percent, along with increasing their crop yield and boosting their wages.

But alternative growing methods carry their own risks.

While farmers can drastically curtail overall emissions if they alternate between wetting and drying, this only works if they flood the crops shallowly. Otherwise as water levels fluctuate, it brings in oxygen which mingles with the nitrogen in the soil and fertilisers to release nitrous oxide, according to K. Kritee, a scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). Nitrous oxide is 300 times more damaging than CO2 and stays around for more than 100 years longer.

“It requires a careful dance of water levels to manage two populations of microbes,” she said. To reduce emissions risk from both gases, a study by the EDF in India suggested keeping the water level between five centimetres (cm) above the surface and five cm below. Over a 20-year horizon, total GHG emissions from rice could take the same toll on the environment as 1,200 coal plants, with the impact dropping to the equivalent of 600 coal plants over 100 years, EDF research shows.

Essential training needed

While a lot of farmers in countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Lao are already being encouraged to grow rice on non-flooded fields, part of the challenge is that farmers need to be trained, for instance, in how to use field water tubes to measure moisture levels. Rolling out such methods in India and China, where rice is a daily staple, will be difficult because of the prevalence of small-scale farms where the grain is produced by families for their own consumption. At the moment, it can take more than 1,400 litres of water to produce one kilogram of rice, according to the International Rice Research Institute.

Olam and SRP aim to train 150,000 farmers by 2023 in Asia and Africa. But even that will barely move the needle, accounting for only 0.1 percent of the households farming rice globally.

One solution for the environment, according to Kritee, would be for consumers to shift to eating more alternative grains — like maize and wheat — that leaves less of a footprint.

But rice consumption is rising in Europe and the US as more people adopt vegetarian and vegan diets. Even so, the US makes up less than one percent of total consumption, compared with almost 50 percent in China and India. To meet growing demand in the next 25 years, rice production must increase by 25 percent, according to the International Rice Research Institute.

“It’s a dilemma how to deal with this because rice is a staple and of deep cultural value for all in Asia,” Kritee said. - Bloomberg

35,35,FL-2019-000057-IDN,Five fantasy book series to read after 'Game of Thrones' ends - Jakarta Post,https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2019/06/09/five-fantasy-book-series-to-read-after-game-of-thrones-ends.html,"The end of the Game of Thrones television series marks the end of an era. Despite that the book series on which the TV adaptation is based, A Song of Ice of Fire, has still not ended, any fan would be on the lookout for something new while awaiting author George RR Martin to finally finish The Winds of Winter.

Here are some fantasy series to read if you miss Game of Thrones:

1. The Earthsea series

Author: Ursula K. Le Guin

Focusing on the life of young Ged, the series is a classic coming-of-age story flooded with magic. However, it makes a satisfying read for adults as well.

Published in 1968, the first book, A Wizard of Earthsea, was highly influential in the fantasy genre. Set on an archipelagic planet called Earthsea, the series explores how the balance or the order of the world is kept and disrupted by magicians.

Studio Ghibli's movie Tales of the Earthsea was loosely adapted from the series, although Le Guin has stated that the series and the movie relate different stories.

2. The Temeraire series

Author: Naomi Novik

The most awesome part of Game of Thrones, beside the political intrigue and scheming, is obviously the dragons. The Temeraire series occurs in an alternate universe, in which dragons play significant roles in shaping history – particularly during the Napoleonic Wars. A member of Britain’s Royal Navy, Captain William Laurence, hatches an unusual dragon egg, Temeraire, with whom he begins to have an intimate bond, forcing the captain to move to the infamous Aerial Corps instead.

If you don't feel like committing to a nine-book series, try the standalone Uprooted instead to have a taste of Naomi Novik. The book also has a dragon and won the prestigious 2016 Nebula award for best novel.

3. Lord of the Rings

Author: JRR Tolkien

Making a list of fantasy series without including the Lord of The Rings (LoTR) is almost a blasphemy. Before “Dracarys” became the catchphrase of the day, fantasy lovers knew at least one Elvish word, which is the answer to the famous riddle: ""Speak friend and enter"".

Set in Middle Earth, the epic trilogy follows the journey of a hobbit, Frodo Baggins, on a quest to destroy the Ring of Power and Dark Lord Sauron. Frodo is accompanied by fellow hobbits as well as human men Aragorn and Boromir (played by none other than Sean Bean), dwarf Gimli, elven prince Legolas and Gandalf the wizard.

LoTR heavily influences pop culture and the genre of fantasy itself. So if you have not read the series, now is probably the right time.

4. The Discworld series

Author: Terry Pratchett

One of Thrones' strengths lies in its characters, each of whom have their own motivation and moral code – however despicable they might be. In the Discworld universe, consisting of 41 books, you will not run out of whimsical yet richly developed characters, which feel human despite their actual race.

The Discworld series is not a traditional series in which books have to be read in order, but rather a collection of stories that just happen to occur in the same universe. Prepare to be tired of laughing because Terry Pratchett's sense of humor is marvelous.

Also present in the stories: magic, dragon and fictitious religions and gods. In an adaptation of Going Postal, one book in the series, Charles Dance (who played Tywin Lannister) makes an appearance as benevolent tyrant named Lord Vetinari.

5. The Wheel of Time

Author: Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson

The series is set in an unnamed, alternate Earth with a cyclical nature of time – hence the title. The stories mainly take place in the Westlands and Aiel Waste. If the two places remind you of Westeros and Essos, wait until you hear of the Great Blight, which is located in the north, a wilderness populated by evil beings.

There are many kingdoms and city-states, each with their own interests, which sometimes presents an obstacle for the main characters to unite the land against the Dark One's forces. There is also a prophecy of the “Dragon Reborn”, similar to Azor Azhai (The Prince That Was Promised) in the A Song of Ice and Fire series.

A TV series co-produced by Amazon and Sony is in the works.","Sun, 09 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2019/06/09/2019_06_09_74008_1560071223._large.jpg,"['lord', 'earthsea', 'thrones', 'ends', 'series', 'universe', 'book', 'game', 'read', 'fantasy', 'dragon']",

The situation is a cause for concern for Rama Raditya, founder and CEO of Qlue, a mobile app designed to gather and relay public complaints and comments about daily problems or inconvenient occurrences in the city. Qlue provides a platform with artificial intelligence, Internet-of-Things technologies, and data integration, connecting citizens with the government to improve work productivity and efficiency in combating the city’s problems. Through Qlue’s app, government officials receive real-time reports and monitor the city’s situation. Qlue’s analytics platform helps leaders make informed decisions and shape better policies by providing relevant data.

Qlue claims to have helped reduce flooding points in the city by 94% and increase public trust in the government by 47%. The platform has won several awards for its achievements, including the Best M-Government Service award at the 7th World Government Summit in Dubai in February 2019.

KrASIA recently sat down with Rama Raditya to find out more about the roles of technology and data integration in creating a smart city.

KrASIA (Kr): How did you start Qlue?

Rama Raditya (R): It all began in 2014. I was concerned about Jakarta’s urbanization problems, which have persisted for years. I got the idea of using mapping techniques to solve the problems happening in the city when I was working on Google Maps’ program back then. I sent a letter to the former Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama to make a presentation about a platform where citizens can report their complaints, which will be addressed immediately once they are received by officials in charge of the issues. He showed interest in this project, After lengthy discussions, the provincial government of Jakarta was finally committed to collaborating with Qlue by investing and utilizing our dashboard to help create the Jakarta Smart City program.

Kr: Please tell us about Qlue’s latest development. Who are your stakeholders today?

R; We are expanding our services to the B2B sector and working together with various corporations like real estate developers, mall and building management, hospitals, while still maintaining partnerships with government institutions like police departments to provide tech solutions that can help them increase security, safety management, and productivity by up to 50%.

We currently have more than 700,000 users in 15 cities, and we have worked with 17 regional police institutions in Indonesia as well as with more than 60 private enterprises.

Kr: Please tell us about Qlue’s key features and technology.

R: Our key feature is on the dashboard, which is powered by AI, machine learning, and data intelligence to help the government with workforce management. Our technology that is responded quickly by the officers in the field is the key aspect for us.

Although we receive many citizen reports through the app, it is not Qlue’s only source of data. We rely more on live sensors from cameras and CCTV systems that are spread across the city streets and inside buildings. Using an AI-based dashboard, we process data from those cameras with various analytical solutions, including facial recognition, street analysis, and crowd counting. We use license plate recognition that is integrated with parking payment instruments to detect illegal parking. The solutions have helped many companies and government agencies to significantly reduce costs and human errors in monitoring CCTV.

Kr: What are your thoughts on privacy issues in the context of surveillance technologies like smart CCTV?

R: There is no solid regulation for privacy issues for CCTV analytics yet. However, we are willing to work with the government to form this regulation in accordance with our nation’s vision.

Kr: How would you describe a “smart city”?

R: For me, the analogy of a smart city is similar to the smartphone. We receive a lot of information through a smartphone, we take actions and resolve daily problems through various programs installed on our devices. The same principle also applies to the smart city. A smart city incorporates information and communication technology, as well as strong infrastructure, so that all information and data can be captured quickly and accurately by its stakeholders, which are the government and citizens. This information enhances the quality and performances of urban services and will improve the quality of living for its citizens in the long run. There are many indicators that define a smart city, like smart governance, smart mobility and traffic management, smart environment, smart finance, and so forth.

Kr: How far is Jakarta from that description?

R: I think Jakarta is still far from this definition. Ideally, a smart city must be built from scratch with cutting-edge technological infrastructure, from undergrounds pipes that are equipped with IoT to street lights that have been installed with live sensor technology. What we can do for Jakarta is make corrections and prediction actions by collaborating with existing components and new innovations like the MRT.

However, we have witnessed many improvements in Jakarta after Qlue was rolled out. For example, our disaster response management helps estimate flooding potential in the city. We have helped reduce flooding points in Jakarta from 8,000 points into just 400. We also collaborate with the police department to identify potential threats and provide an immediate response by dispatching personnel effectively. Not long ago, we helped the police arrest drug dealers based on citizen’s reports through Qlue. We also helped with securing the general elections this year.

Kr: What has the government’s support been like so far? What is the difference between the support of former governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama and the current governor Anies Baswedan?

R: The government has been supporting us well. Even though Jakarta has a different governor, the system and cooperation that have been built with Qlue are still running, so there is not too much difference. The current Jakarta government still uses Qlue even though they also launched new, similar applications. I don’t think we can build a smart city by ourselves, as it needs many elements and collaboration. However, since we have started before them, we have a number of tech advantages. Qlue is still the mainstay for Jakarta residents as 90% of public complaints accommodated by the Jakarta Provincial Government are channelled through Qlue, and more than 87% of the reports receive a follow-up response immediately.

Kr: What are your hopes for the newly elected government?

R: I hope that IoT regulation in Indonesia can be quickly resolved and defined so that we can accelerate even faster. Currently, there are no clear rules for facial recognition implementation.

Kr: What’s next for Qlue?

R: We will focus on adding more talents and business expansion as we hope that Qlue’s solutions can be implemented at more institutions and companies.

In this flood-ravaged Tulsa suburb, members of Churches of Christ are cleaning up damaged homes and distributing boxes of emergency food and supplies.

A team from The Park Church of Christ in Tulsa worked to clear debris from a flooded residence Sunday, as volunteers at the Sand Springs Church of Christ opened its disaster relief distribution center — as the congregation does every day — from 3 to 7 p.m.

Elliott Dunn, pulpit minister for the 250-member Sand Springs church, talked with The Christian Chronicle about his congregation’s experience.

Question: How hard did the floods hit this area?

Answer: We are located just east of Keystone Dam. The floodwaters coming out of Keystone Lake — they had to release an amount that wound up flooding quite a bit of area here in Sand Springs.

Q: Were members of your congregation affected by the flooding?

A: We’ve had three of our church members here who had water in their homes 2 feet or higher. One of our elders had 5 feet in his house. We’ve had two who had water get in their garage. And then we had a number who had to evacuate, but they were fortunate.

Q: Did they have insurance?

A: The elder has insurance. One of the members does not have insurance. I’m not sure on the other.

I’ve never done this before. I’ve never been through a flood. So I’m learning pretty quickly that if you have insurance, of course that’s going to help a lot. But it’s bad no matter what.

Q: But flooding like this is not something that happens here often?



A: The last one that happened here like this was in 1986, I believe. A lot of people were told in those neighborhoods that there were circumstances then that wouldn’t happen again, shouldn’t happen again. There’s people that were told they don’t live in a floodplain and didn’t need insurance.

A lot of them were told that. So it’s been a mess.

Q: Tell me about this disaster relief center that you’ve opened here at the church.

A: The organization out of Nashville, Tenn. — the Churches of Christ Disaster Relief Effort — we’ve known about them, and we’ve contributed to them like when Hurricane Katrina and things like that happen. So we knew about them.

I’ll just tell you how it happened: The Park Church of Christ in Tulsa got going with them pretty quickly. Then a few days later, we were debating whether to share the items with Park because the disaster is mostly here. But then the guy from that organization there in Nashville contacted us, and we quickly determined that it merited him bringing a semi-truck here as well.

Q: So your members have sprung into action to get this up and running?

A: Yes, they really have. Everything we’ve asked of our members — you know, come and unload a truck, come and get to work doing this — they’ve done it.

Q: Does the community seem grateful for the help you’ve been able to offer?

A: Yes. I’ll back up a step and say: The whole thing is overwhelming.

Of course, for those flooded and affected, it’s mind-boggling. And to the rest of us, it’s overwhelming. Because everyone wants to help. We all want to do something. So people are extremely grateful.

They come in, and they don’t even know what all they need. They just know they’ve lost it, and they’re glad to get anything we can help them with.

But they’re very, very appreciative.

Q: So from your perspective: One day you’re doing church as normal, and the next day you’re into seven-day-a-week emergency distribution?

A: Absolutely.

This is over $70,000 worth of supplies that was brought here on a truck, and a week after the evacuations, we’re handing it out in a very organized manner.

We could not even dream of doing something like this without the Nashville group. I mean, they have it down to a science, to an art.

The guy told me on the phone, “If you need it, I can have it there in 12 hours.” I mean, it’s overwhelming for me, but it’s gone incredibly smoothly.

Q: Disaster relief is something Churches of Christ seem to do extremely well.

A: It is. I mean, people are already making comments. They notice.

I’ll put it this way: One of our members came this morning. She said, “I have to tell you. This woman I know from work. She was bragging on our church.” This woman had heard the story about when it was time to evacuate. Without an hour, we had 20 people and two big trucks at the (flooded) elder’s house and carrying out stuff.

So the community sees who’s really helping, and it makes a big impression.

I told our church this morning: We talk about when Jesus said, “When I was hungry, you fed me,” and now’s our chance to step up and show it.","Tue, 04 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://christianchronicle.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ET_IMG_0949.jpg,"['okla', 'flooded', 'suburb', 'thing', 'sand', 'team', 'overwhelming', 'springs', 'church', 'park', 'christ', 'tulsa']",

ISLAMABAD: Former Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari was arrested on corruption charges on Monday, a Pakistani official said, in a blow to the opposition Pakistan People’s Party.

National Accountability Bureau (NAB) spokesman Nawazish Ali confirmed to Reuters that Zardari has been arrested, but did not provide details.

Local media channels said NAB arrested Zardari over its investigation into fake bank accounts and money laundering.

A batch of 50 women, who have experienced natural disasters and extreme weather, will be trained by the administration to deal with associated emergencies.

They will mobilise communities during evacuations and train others to carry the initiative forward.

High-speed winds had smacked into sturdy mango trees and shaken the fruits away. They were all over the ground. Extremely severe cyclonic storm Fani’s dread had barely passed. Rashmi Behera and her friends were busy collecting the fallen mangoes when one of the trees, seemingly weakened by the storm, suddenly toppled.

A severed branch fell on a cow.

Abandoning her pursuit, Behera, a college-going member of one of the 50,000 self-help groups (SHGs) in Odisha’s Ganjam district, rallied her friends and managed to ease the branch off the animal.

“We managed to save her and release her on the field. It was deeply satisfying and the mangoes that we collected were turned into dishes and we ended up savouring them for days thereafter,” Behera recollects with pride.

Behera and 49 of her equally enthusiastic counterparts, between the ages 18 and 35, from various women SHGs, have been handpicked by the Ganjam district administration to be part of its Swayamsidha initiative to train women leaders in disaster preparedness.

“After we acquire basic skills, we can train others in our village and carry it forward. This way we can mobilise communities efficiently during calamities,” Behera told this visiting Mongabay-India correspondent ahead of their training in June.

Maximising potential of women SHGs in disaster risk reduction

Ganjam district’s international claim to fame is linked to the olive ridley turtles. Thousands of these turtles crawl ashore each year from the Bay of Bengal to nest in the rookery at the mouth of the Rushikulya river in the district.

But Ganjam, one of the three most cyclone-prone districts in the state, is also reputed to have strong participation by women in self-help groups, engaged in floriculture, pickling, mushroom cultivation, keora cultivation and other activities, since the late 1990s.

The district administration is banking on these women’s SHG-linked leadership skills and experience with disasters to implement the programme that involves the police, the fire department, forest, agriculture, women and child and health departments.

The departments will impart domain-specific skills in managing exigencies such as cyclone, heatwave, earthquake, droughts, wildfires and snakebites.

Twenty-year-old Behera admits she could not do much during cyclone Titli that struck Odisha in December 2018 as she lacked the confidence to reach out to people. But after becoming a member of a self-help group recently, she became active.

“During Fani we could help save human lives as well as livestock,” Behera beamed. She believes after her training as part of Swayamsidha, she will get better in disaster preparedness and improve upon her past record in disaster relief.

Manorama Reddy, the District Social Welfare Officer, who is steering the programme said the idea is to make individuals self-reliant so they do not have to wait for anybody else to come to their and their family’s rescue in the immediate aftermath of a disaster.

While women’s vulnerability to disasters is underscored, Reddy believes, it is equally important to understand their role and maximise their potential in disaster risk reduction.

Women’s high level of risk awareness, social networking practices, extensive knowledge of their communities, managing natural environmental resources and caring abilities makes them important players of effective risk assessment, early warning, disaster response and recovery actions.

“The 50 trainees will help mobilise communities. People will know whom to contact in emergencies. The trainees will learn the first steps they need to take in emergencies, without putting themselves in harm’s way. Overall, we hope the training will have a domino effect on the other women to volunteer to join the platform,” said Reddy.

Urmila Pradhan, another Swayamsidha select, highlights with an example.

“Say a person is drowning in a river and when we spot that person we too jump in to save that person. Consequently, the rescuer also drowns in the process. If we are trained then we will know how to save that person without going in the water,” Pradhan said.

Odisha, home to 46 million people, has been struck by recorded 128 tropical cyclones in 200 years (1804 to 1999), including the supercyclone of October 28 to 30, 1999, which killed approximately 10,000 people and had a 7.5-metre storm surge.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) while fewer tropical cyclones will form, the global proportion of tropical cyclones that reach very intense (Category 4 and 5) levels will likely increase due to anthropogenic warming over the next century.

The first batch of leaders in the making

While identifying the leaders, the district administration zeroed-in on the most vulnerable pockets of the district. “It helps that they have an understanding of the challenges of the disasters and the scale they can take,” said Reddy.

For instance, S. Jyoti Reddy who works with the district collectorate and is an SHG member, recalls the exercise to move vulnerable groups to shelters during cyclone Titli last December. Whisking the elderly, pregnant women, children and the disabled, away to safety remains a priority.

“We went and rescued pregnant women from flooded areas and gave them cooked meals and dry goods. They accessed health services and medications,” 35-year-old Reddy added.

But Reddy and others in the first batch of 50 trainees, including N. Puspanjali, who worked through cyclone Phailin in 2013 and then in Titli five years later, emphasised that people generally are reluctant to abandon their homes and shift to cyclone shelters or safer spaces.

“If people are suddenly asked to evacuate then they don’t want to leave,” 25-year-old Puspanjali said.

“If there is an emergency then how will the administration come and help (if they are not in the shelters). They can’t possibly go door-to-door. People have to be in one place. They don’t have faith in us,” Puspanjali lamented, adding that the coaching will help her counsel and efficiently convince people to leave.

“This time too (during Fani), getting them to move was a major challenge,” said a flustered Puspanjali.

Adored as “queen of Titli” by her peers, for her bravado in rescuing the elderly and livestock from flooded areas during the cyclone, that eventually won her a recognition from the state government, Mitonjali Gowda is looking forward to learning how to administer first aid to snake-bite patients in the aftermath of a cyclone-related flood.

“After the cyclone when flooding occurs, snakes and insects turn up. If someone is bitten then we do not have the know-how to take care of them,” explained Gowda, who got married barely two days after Fani disrupted life in Odisha on May 3.

Vijay Kulangey, the District Collector and Magistrate, believes creating a cadre-like group for disaster preparedness will instil discipline and more resilience in the participants and in the communities they lead in times of crisis.

“We have designed a special uniform for them which will make them instantly recognisable on the field. A customised disaster management kit will be provided to them. And to ensure sustainability we will train more batches and involve them livelihood support schemes,” Kulangey added.","Mon, 03 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2019/06/03091751/IMG_20190529_122424320-1200x800.jpg,"['preparedness', 'administration', 'women', 'ganjam', 'recovery', 'way', 'train', 'communities', 'reddy', 'disaster', 'odishas', 'titli', 'behera', 'cyclone', 'lead', 'district']",

Now, as an American political battle over reproductive rights rages more fiercely than it has in years, the group known for their catchphrase ""Revolution Girl Style, Now!"" is back, reuniting to spread their message of empowerment and equality, protesting violence against women and normalizing female anger.

The group -- including frontwoman Kathleen Hanna, Tobi Vail, Kathi Wilcox and newcomer Erica Dawn Lyle -- broke up in 1997 but recently delivered a thunderous series of performances in New York after playing shows in Los Angeles, and will rock London on Monday.

""The world needs them again. I feel like they're like Captain Marvel, and we've flashed the Bikini Kill sign to bring them back to earth, because it's just messed up here,"" said Evelyn McDonnell, a pop culture writer whose bibliography includes the book Women Who Rock.

""They just expressed this new energy of feminism in such a wonderfully direct, emotional fashion,"" she told AFP.

""That was what was amazing about seeing them live again -- this crowd full of thousands of fans, predominantly women, and of multiple generations, people who had seen them the first time around and people who weren't born the first time around,"" she said, calling it a release of ""all this pent-up energy.""

'Girls to the front'

First formed in Washington state in 1990, Bikini Kill pioneered the provocative ""riot grrrl"" movement that became a dynamic force across the then male-dominated American punk scene, blossoming in the underground before quickly garnering national attention.

The subculture fueled by abrasive rock became a haven for girls and women who formed bands and reading groups nationwide as a form of cultural resistance, taking on themes of sexual violence and misogyny.

Beyond concerts much of the movement was founded on a culture of zines -- small-circulation, self-created publications -- that saw subscribers to the ethos espouse their grievances and goals.

Sara Marcus, the author of a riot grrrl history entitled Girls To the Front -- another Hanna motto, encouraging women to occupy the front of concert venues during shows -- began attending meetings of the Washington, DC chapter in 1993.

""Everybody was a feminist. And not just a feminist -- I had a feminist club at my high school, but nobody was as mad as I was,"" Marcus, who grew up in suburban Maryland, told AFP.

""At riot grrrl, everybody was as mad.""

'Taste the revolution'

Friends of Nirvana -- legend has it the title for the band's signature hit ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" came from graffiti Hanna scrawled on Kurt Cobain's bedroom wall -- and an inspiration for scores of bands including Russia's Pussy Riot, Bikini Kill eschewed the mainstream music industry eager to sign them.

That independent spirit is perhaps what lead to the seminal band's downfall; without the support system of even a manager or booking agent, they succumbed to infighting and burnout.

But for McDonnell, the cultural moment they cultivated ""got picked up on in mainstream forms, like Alanis Morissette or The Spice Girls.

""I started my band because of them,"" said Nadya Tolokonnikova, 29, of the anarchist feminist collective Pussy Riot, calling seeing Bikini Kill live at a recent LA show ""mind-blowing"".

""It just gave me this beautiful feeling that probably I'm doing the right thing.""

As the band -- whose members are now in their 40s and 50s -- tore through their trademark track ""Rebel Girl"" at a Brooklyn show, the stage lights flooded the theater in rainbow colors -- an overt nod to June's Pride Month celebration -- as Hanna sang: ""In her kiss / I taste the revolution!""

Marcus said she hopes both old guard Bikini Kill comrades and those encountering the movement for the first time will draw inspiration under a White House she dubbed ""nakedly repressive.""

""We need a million Bikini Kills,"" she said. ""Girls, women, trans people, non-binary people, races, ethnicities -- we need to be making culture that helps us understand the moment we're in and helps harden us to just go another day.""","Mon, 10 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2019/06/10/2019_06_10_74063_1560139346._large.jpg,"['women', 'kill', 'hanna', 'band', 'riot', 'comeback', 'feminist', 'bikini', 'bands', 'punk', 'movement', 'stages', 'seminal']", 
41,41,FL-2019-000057-IDN,"Amid tornado and flood response, the National Guard is gearing up for hurricane season - ArmyTimes.com",https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2019/05/31/amid-tornado-and-flood-response-the-national-guard-is-gearing-up-for-hurricane-season/,"Damage tolls have already piled up this year in the face of massive flooding and devastating tornadoes in the Midwest. Amid those responses, the National Guard is shoring up for hurricane season, which officially kicks off Saturday and lasts until the end of November.

More than 5,000 airmen and soldiers are well poised to respond throughout the Gulf and Atlantic coasts and the Caribbean, the Guard’s vice director of domestic operations told reporters on Thursday, despite the existing work load.

“That does not impact [a response], if we had a major hurricane strike next week,” Air Force Brig. Gen. Jeff Burkett said. “We have an in-depth bench that can be called on if needed.”

To prepare, units have run their own local exercises, made updates to their communications process so that everyone has the right person to call and forecasting which units will be ready to respond to events in every area. That includes units whose members may be victims of the disasters themselves, and who would be able to travel to fill in.

Guardsman recalls Hurricane Michael, urges coastal residents to prepare for new season of storms Riding out a direct hit from Hurricane Michael at Tyndall Air Force Base in October tested the nerve of this Air Force veteran, and spurred him to double down on preparedness plans for his family.

“We’re doing very predictive force planning on this and thinking through how we can support each other very effectively, very quickly if a disaster happens,” Burkett said.

Texas, for example, has done two exercises this year, he said, and has another planned for June.

“The responses to these events – it starts at the local level,"" he said. “All disasters are local disasters.”

Though National Guard troops are often deployed to help with evacuation, search and rescue and then relief, Burkett said that the Guard really should only step in when local law enforcement, emergency response and public health agencies are overwhelmed.

“I would say, only call on the military … when you absolutely have to,” he said. “We should always be a last resort.”

Still, leaders have confidence that each state’s Guard is trained and equipped enough to handle not only emergency response, but their responsibilities to deploy overseas when called up, as well as help out neighboring states in a crisis.

“I don’t have any indicators if it’s going to be better or worse,” Burkett said of this year’s hurricane season.

Still, past years have prompted more planning and coordination, so that state Guards can anticipate what they’ll need and whom to reach out to in every contingency.

“Part of a good response is just knowing who you are, at the state level,"" Burkett said.

But even if storms pile up, he said, there aren’t any concerns at his level about burning through resources.

“I can’t think of a time when we’ve really run out of capability to leverage against a problem,” he said.","Fri, 31 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/0swnnU6FibV6IcPd77uGvoK-n20=/1200x630/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-mco.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QIE4WP4XQNCBFMKXN35IB4CZ5Y.jpg,"['tornado', 'flood', 'army', 'hurricane', 'units', 'response', 'force', 'burkett', 'guard', 'gearing', 'level', 'local', 'amid', 'national', 'disasters', 'season']", 
42,42,FL-2019-000057-IDN,El Niño is back. Is it to blame for our severe weather woes? - NBCNews.com,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/el-ni-o-back-it-blame-our-severe-weather-woes-ncna1012526,"After a spring that soaked parts of California and saw destructive tornadoes rip through towns stretching from Texas to Pennsylvania, scientists are paying close attention to how much of the country’s recent severe weather is due to the return of El Niño, a naturally occurring climate pattern that last drove a series of climate anomalies and extremes four years ago.

El Niño occurs when changes in the strength or direction of trade winds cause waters in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean to become warmer than usual. El Niño events, which happen on irregular cycles that last two to seven years, have far-ranging effects on global temperatures, rainfall, hurricanes and other severe storm systems.

“El Niños are the biggest source of changes in weather patterns around the world,” said Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.

The last major El Niño occurred from 2015 to 2016, resulting in a record 16 tropical cyclones in the Pacific basin and a global temperature record set in 2015. Last October, climatologists once again detected warm waters in the equatorial Pacific, and in February the federal Climate Prediction Center officially declared El Niño conditions. Climatologists say the planet is currently experiencing a weak El Niño that will likely persist into the summer, but even weaker El Niños can alter weather around the globe in significant ways.

Typically, El Niño events increase rainfall across the country, particularly in the southern United States and parts of California.

“In the last 12 months, if you look at the U.S. as a whole, it has been the wettest 12-month period on record since 1895,” said David Zierden, the state climatologist of Florida, who is based at Florida State University in Tallahassee. “El Niño didn’t cause all that rainfall, but it certainly contributed.”

Elsewhere, drier climates tend to prevail during El Niño events.

“In general, it will be drier for a lot of the world, so we’ll likely see more drought,” Trenberth said. “In places like Indonesia and Australia, the risk of wildfire goes up. But in North America, it’s the other way around.”

The recurring climate phenomenon also affects hurricanes, which are usually suppressed in the Atlantic during El Niño. Warmer water in the Pacific changes the air temperature over the ocean, which skews how winds normally circulate around the planet. One of these effects is increased wind shear, which can tear hurricanes apart or stop them from forming in the first place. In the agency’s yearly outlook for the hurricane season, which began Saturday and lasts until Nov. 30, NOAA cited El Niño as one of several competing weather patterns that is expected to contribute to a “near-normal” season.

But while El Niño events can curb the number of strong Atlantic hurricanes, the opposite is true for storms that develop in the Pacific.

“El Niño increases Pacific hurricanes and tends to favor longer-lived storms in the western Pacific, like typhoons,” said Phil Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins.

The relationship between El Niño and tornadoes is less well understood.

Within the planet’s subtropical zone, where many of these weather systems develop, “there are a lot of other things that play a role to create the necessary ingredients to get severe storms going,” Klotzbach said.

This spring has already seen its share of destructive tornadoes, with strong twisters pummeling western Ohio, Texas, Missouri and Nebraska. Over a 12-day stretch beginning on May 17, there were 225 confirmed tornadoes across the country.

A 2016 study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters found that even a weak El Niño could increase the risk of spring tornadoes in the upper Midwest. But at Florida State University, research done by Zierden and his colleagues found that El Niño conditions tend to decrease the risk of springtime tornadoes in Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas and South Dakota — a swath of the south-central United States that is known as “Tornado Alley” because severe storms strike this region with a disproportionately high frequency.

“If you ask 100 scientists about the impact of El Niño on tornadoes, you might get 100 different answers,” Klotzbach said. “With tornadoes, it’s a more nuanced process.”

Another thing that is not yet well understood is how El Niño events may be affected by climate change. According to a study published in December 2018 in the journal Nature, El Niños may become stronger and more frequent as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, raising global surface temperatures and warming the planet’s oceans.

But Klotzbach said more research is needed, especially to determine whether any observed changes are due to global warming or natural variability in El Niño cycles.

“Our models tend to indicate that we should see more central Pacific El Niño events, and ones that are more intense, but there’s quite a bit of uncertainty,” he said. “How much is El Niño going to change in the future? That’s a huge open question that will be very important in terms of how climate change impacts future weather.”

43,43,FL-2019-000057-IDN,Could floating cities help people adapt to rising sea levels? - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/could-floating-cities-help-people-adapt-to-rising-sea-levels-116685,"By end of the century, rising seas will flood more than 500 coastal cities, affecting 1.5 billion people worldwide. Some estimates predict surging sea level rise of two meters by 2100.

Countries like Kiribati, a nation of low lying coral atolls in the Pacific, will likely disappear entirely. This is why Kiribati is among the countries to have explored the possibility of artificial islands replacing natural ones.

It may sound counter-intuitive, but floating architecture provides two big advantages. First, it creates “land” that moves with the waves and thus is resilient in the face of flooding. Second, it allows cities to expand their pressurised coastal urban spaces.

Blue21 , Author provided

Floating islands have been popularised by The Seasteading Institute, which advocates for “seasteads” – politically autonomous human settlements in international waters. The institute was founded by the libertarian Patri Friedman and controversial Facebook investor Peter Thiel. Consequently, some scholars have criticised floating islands as the playthings of Silicon Valley billionaires trying to escape taxes.

But perhaps there is another side to offshore housing. As I have looked at in my PhD, floating architecture can also be a green and sustainable technology to help adapt to climate change.

No wonder the Global Center on Adaptation, a new international organisation focused on adaptation to climate change, has plans for a floating office space in Rotterdam. Another example is the Floating Island Project in French Polynesia, the focus of my research over the past three years. It was intended to be a village with special regulations floating in a lagoon, however the project lost government support after protests during the Polynesian presidential elections of 2018.

There are good reasons to be cautious about the idea that floating architecture can help communities adapt to sea level rise. The first high-tech iterations may indeed be too costly and complicated for many areas affected by sea level rise, but the growth in solar and floating home technologies point to prices reducing with time.

Amphibious architecture vs reclaimed land

One of the key advantages of floating architecture is its sustainability compared to land reclamation, which can displace natural sediments and harm the marine ecosystem, since it usually means dumping sand on the seabed, annihilating corals and plankton at the bottom of the food chain.

In contrast, floating buildings can create artificial reefs, providing food and shelter for marine life. Reclaimed lands are also more vulnerable to earthquakes – a prime example is Mexico City, which was built over a lake.

How it works

People have been living on human-made islands for hundreds of years. Examples include Nueva Veneciain Colombia⁠, the Uros in Lake Titikaka, Peru, or the nomads of Bajau Lautin Malaysia.

Future floating cities are particularly intriguing because they represent an infrastructural blank slate. In theory, they do not need to connect to land infrastructure and can operate self-sufficiently, in a closed loop with their own solar panels and desalination plants.

Floating buildings will be of two types: some are semi-submersible, and have foundations on the sea bed, like oil rigs. Others are pontoons, such as the floating homes in Ijburg, Amsterdam, Amsterdam which fully float on the water surface and are kept stable by mooring systems.

Very large floating structures can typically withstand rough seas better than boats, making them more comfortable for longer periods. The preferred material for building the floating platforms is concrete. Shaped in the right way, its can keep afloat. For buildings, materials are up to individual taste and affordability.

Floating technologies

The sheer amount of existing floating infrastructure points to the eventual emergence of floating cities. We already have floating: solar farms, wind farms, runways, bridges, container docks, nuclear plants, farms, stages, restaurants, hotels, storage facilities, student houses and homes. There is even a floating prison and floating surf pools.

So I have no doubt that floating cities are possible and will become a reality at some point this century. The biggest challenges will be legal and political – not technological.

In my research I have explored property ownership in floating cities. Legal frameworks are crucial because floating cities mean private buildings over oceans, which are transboundary commons. Will homeowners own the plot of water too? Will they instead own their homes, but claim temporary ownership of the space, as in trailer parks? And, if buildings are public, should we grant oceans legal personhood to ensure higher environmental protection?

There is no final answer to these questions, as each city will be unique and complex in its own way, and offshore living is only just starting.

Consolidated Pastoral Company (CPC) released its 2019 financial results last week announcing that its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were $36.2 million before non-recurring flood and drought costs and the impact of herd valuation following the drought, which were $23.1m.

This was an increase of $1.9m from $34.3m in 2018.

""While the impact of the drought and floods have been felt across the industry, we are pleased with the underlying performance of CPC,"" said CPC chief executive Troy Setter.

""The CPC team has worked hard to grow our herd during this dry year.""

After the non-recurring flood and drought-related impacts, CPC reported an EBITDA of $12.5m, which does not include property revaluations.

CPC's assets at year-end totalled $921.5m, compared to $925.5m in 2018.

This figure reflects higher land valuations, larger herd numbers and the sale of Nockatunga station, in south west Queensland, prior to the year end.

Revenue was $128.5m for 2019, down 8.8 per cent from $140.9m in 2018, which CPC attributed to lower average cattle values than last year and increased herd size.

Underlying profit after tax was up at $22.9m, compared to $15.8m in 2018.

This did not include the non-recurring flood and drought impacts.

The company recorded a loss after tax of $800,000, which were before one-off costs of $4m associated with corporate activity.

In terms of operational activity, CPC's cattle brandings were up 20pc year on year.

Beef production saw an increase of 29pc on the previous corresponding period (pcp), with 34.6 million kilograms produced.

Investments in property development continued, including $4.4m in capex towards water and fencing infrastructure to improve productivity and increase carrying capacity, contributing $14.4m to the property valuation increase.

Further investment in land development enabled CPC to improve productivity and increase carrying capacity.

The ongoing management of capital with the sale and leaseback of Manbulloo station, near Katherine, Northern Territory, was agreed upon last month.



CPC increased its shareholding to 90pc with Juang Jaya Abdi Alam (JJAA) in Indonesia, which owns and operates two feedlots, continued with strong profitability.

CPC's direct sales channels primarily involve selling cattle and beef to Asian consumer markets, domestic feedlots and processors, and exporting live cattle.

The company commenced a land conversion program to unlock further value with cattle land being converted to cropping land.

CPC's drawn debt has been reduced from $235.7m to $224.6m.

With the company claiming workplace health and safety to be a key priority, there was a 38pc decrease in days lost due to injury year-on-year.

""Total assets increased on a like-for-like basis, reflecting strong land valuations as well as the value being driven by our ongoing capital investment program,"" Mr Setter said.

""As a leading integrated beef and cattle supplier to international markets, we are well positioned to continue to benefit from the strong global demand for beef and further value creation through the development of our assets.""

As at March 31, 2019, CPC owned and operated 15 cattle stations of more than 4.7 million hectares (mha), however with properties being sold since, these numbers have changed.

In March 2018, CPC announced its decision to divest its entire portfolio of 16 stations under ownership, spanning more than 5.5mha.

At the time, CPC's pastoral portfolio was estimated to be worth more than $1 billion.

In October 2018, Nockatunga was the first property to sell since the confirmed sell down.

It sold for a speculated price of $50m to Cleveland Agriculture, which is owned by Malcolm Harris.

The 2019 year began with CPC revealing in January that it had sold three stations to Clean Agriculture & International Tourism (CAIT).

Auvergne and Newry stations, Northern Territory and Argyle Downs, in the East Kimberley, were sold to CAIT for about $135m.

Sterling Buntine's Baldy Bay Pty bought Mimong, north west Queensland and Comely stations, central Queensland, for about $20m and $50m, respectively.

With Comely being the most recent sale disclosed to the public in April 2019, CPC said its portfolio comprised 10 cattle stations owned and operated by the company, with a carrying capacity of close to 326,000 head across 3.8mha.

CPC is owned by the United Kingdom private equity firm Terra Firma, which purchased CPC in 2009.

""Climate change acts as a catalyst: It makes conflicts more likely,"" he said. ""We don't have any time to waste.""

Sharpening the UN's response to climate change is a top priority for Germany during its two-year stint as a nonpermanent member of the Security Council, which began this year. Despite the urgency for action, political roadblocks both at home and abroad will make implementation difficult.

Baron Waqa (L), president of Nauru, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas (M) und John Kerry, former US secretary of state, all gave remarks at the conference

German call to action

The forum, hosted by Germany's Foreign Ministry, brought together political, scientific and business leaders from more than 25 nations. Maas used the event to present a three-point ""Berlin Call for Action,"" which outlines goals for the UN to ""be as proactive as possible"" in stemming conflicts associated with climate change.

According to the plan, the UN should better monitor island and equatorial nations most susceptible to food shortages and national disaster, reporting regularly on the situations to improve communication and response time. It should also pilot programs that weave climate action into every facet of foreign policy.

Germany is poised to lead the charge on such initiatives due to the government's ambitious climate program, Maas added. In 2018, 40% of Germany's energy mix was powered by renewables. Meanwhile, legislation to divorce Germany from coal-powered energy and set sector-specific emissions targets in tricky areas like transportation and housing are slated for adoption this year.

Germany also made climate change a main priority during its 2011-2012 Security Council elected membership. The focus had few substantive outcomes, but it did help push environmental security threats such as desertification in North Africa and migration issues into Security Council discussions, analysts note.

Though times for truth

But the political environment surrounding climate change is more complex now than it was ten years ago, former US Secretary of State John Kerry noted in his keynote speech at the conference.

""Facts are under assault, truth is mobbed,"" he said. He added that both science and the multilateral diplomacy needed to address the security risks of climate change are under attack. ""That is not how you make any nation great, and that's not how you protect people in the world.""

The remarks evoked rhetoric commonly used by US President Donald Trump, who recently withdrew the US from the 2016 Paris climate agreement. Originally signed by 194 nations and the EU, with Kerry as the US representative, the agreement seeks to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

President Trump also recently barred the federal agency that reports on the impact of climate change from presenting projections past the year 2040, which is before scientists expect the most disastrous effects of climate change to hit Western nations.

US President Donald Trump has pushed for the continued use of fossil fuels and questioned scientific evidence surrounding climate change

German auto woes

The US may be an extreme case as of late, but its developments to stymie climate change action are no isolated incident, Kerry noted: ""No country in the world, despite the best intentions of most, is getting the job done.""

Once seen as an environmental leader, Germany has been criticized in recent years by its European partners for losing momentum on fighting climate change.

Read more: German issues in a nutshell: 'Energiewende'

In a country where roughly 800,000 jobs depend on the automobile industry, political leaders have taken little action against auto manufacturers such as Volkswagen for their role in the 2015 ""Dieselgate"" emissions scandal or towards changing Germany's dependency on combustion engine transport.

Meanwhile, emissions in the transportation and housing sectors have barely budged since 1990. Studies show that Germany could miss its emissions reduction goals for 2020 by at least 8%. And new environmental legislation lauded by Foreign Minister Maas in his opening remarks has been dragged down by intergovernmental bickering over possible effects on the economy.

""Everything moves faster in the digital age, except for government,"" Kerry commented.

Getting the message

Reluctant Western governments will soon get the message about the urgent need for climate action, Shirley Botchway, Ghana's minister of foreign affairs, said at the conference, pointing to the relationship between climate change and migration.

""Our countries are agricultural, and if we do not have high yields anymore because farming is destroyed, people will move from rural to urban areas. And when they don't find work, they move on perilous journeys ... crossing into Europe and the Americas,"" she said. ""Then it's not just Ghana's problem.""

Global mass migration, ongoing conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, as well as instability in Europe due to the United Kingdom's impending departure from the European Union, have all dominated recent discussions on the Security Council.

Given its already prominent role in global affairs, Germany's return to the council as a non-permanent member gives it an opportunity to act as a balancing force in such discussions. Permanent members of the council are often divided between France, the US and the UK on one side, and China and Russia on the other. Germany could leverage its position to push a climate agenda based on stability that could breathe life into stalled climate policies, both at home and abroad.

New impetus in such policies can't come soon enough, Kerry noted.

""If Europe thinks that the migration that came from Turkey and from Syria was a political game changer, wait until you see the migration from half of Northern Africa and the Middle East that has no ability to grow food, have water and be able to live decently,"" he said. ""They'll be pounding at the door because leaders today were unwilling to do what they know they have to do.""","Tue, 04 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/45033224_6.jpg,"['foreign', 'security', 'risk', 'pushes', 'climate', 'change', 'germany', 'kerry', 'action', 'political', 'maas', 'council']",

48,48,FL-2019-000057-IDN,Impact of El Nino: A peek into a changing world - The Straits Times,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/a-peek-into-a-changing-world,"When El Nino's winds of change blow strongly across the Pacific Ocean, a trail of destruction tends to follow.

On the western boundary of the world's largest ocean basin sits Singapore and the rest of the maritime continent, while to the east lies the Americas.

Neither escapes the scourge of El Nino.

For when the winds of change blow and the ocean churns in acquiescence, El Nino can scar South-east Asia with fire and haze. Yet, across the Pacific Ocean, El Nino brings rain so intense to the arid coasts of South America that lakes form in deserts.

The see-saw impacts seem like a bundle of contradictions, not unlike the phenomenon itself.

El Nino is one of the world's largest natural climate cycles, caused by changes to wind patterns and the swirl of ocean currents. El Nino is Spanish for ""the little boy"", but the havoc it can wreak is far from child-like.

In 2015, for example, the El Nino event caused South-east Asia to suffer its worst haze episode on record.

It brought drier weather to the region, causing the smoke-belching forest fires in Indonesia to burn harder and longer.

The World Bank estimated that the fires cost Indonesia more than US$16 billion (S$21.9 billion), and studies have shown that the pollution caused 100,000 early deaths in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.

The 2015 event was the most recent strong El Nino event, and is considered one of the three largest ones to have occurred in the past five decades.

In 1982 and 1997 also, strong El Ninos reared their heads, affecting not only South-east Asia but also nearly wiping out populations of unique animals, such as the world's only equator-dwelling penguins 18,000km away on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.

This year is an El Nino year, too, according to the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

While El Nino is a natural phenomenon that would occur regardless of human-caused climate change, some studies have shown that it could become more intense and frequent as the world warms.

Insight travelled to Riau in Indonesia and the Galapagos in Ecuador with the support of the University of California's Scripps Institution of Oceanography to take a look at El Nino and its impact - ranging from changing rainfall patterns to warming seas, that could offer a glimpse into what things would be like in a warming world.

THE BOY CHILD

Like the tantrums of a petulant child, the destruction that El Nino has wrought in recent decades has made the world sit up and pay more attention.

The 1982 event, in particular, was a turning point. That year, El Nino caused a global catastrophe - droughts in the western Pacific and beyond, going as far west as Africa and India - and it dumped huge amounts of rain in Ecuador and northern Peru.

That event also resulted in one of the first in-depth reports of El Nino in the mainstream media. In February 1984, the National Geographic ran a multi-page report documenting the impacts of the 1982 El Nino.

But El Nino is not a new phenomenon. Centuries ago, Peruvian fishermen observed a periodic warming of the ocean along the South American coast - usually a rich fishing ground - which emptied their nets of fish.

As this usually occurred around Christmas, they named the phenomenon El Nino, a reference to the birth of Jesus Christ.

Mr Rodney Martinez, international director for the International Research Centre on El Nino, or Ciifen, says the term has since been ""kidnapped"" by the scientific community.

It was not a bad thing, he says, although it may cause confusion since the same name was also used to refer to phenomena of different scales.

""For Peruvians and Ecuadorians, El Nino is a local event that happens when there is a sustained warming of the ocean that brings heavy rainfall in some places,"" he tells The Sunday Times at his office in Guayaquil, Ecuador.

Today, El Nino is better known by the international community as a global phenomenon, with a footprint spanning the tropical Pacific Ocean. It can also affect weather beyond the Pacific basin through links known as teleconnections.

On a broader scale, El Nino refers to the warm phase of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, one of the world's largest natural climate cycles that influences sea surface temperatures and rainfall patterns.

The cool phase, known as La Nina, has an opposite effect - causing more rain in the west, and drier conditions in the east.

Both El Nino and La Nina cause changes to rainfall patterns. But El Nino events can be more destructive.

As the Pacific Ocean warms, it energises the ocean, charging up the atmosphere and affecting rainfall patterns, says Dr Xie Shang-Ping, a climate modeller and El Nino expert from Scripps.

""The atmosphere just doesn't respond as strongly to La Nina as it does to El Nino,"" he says.

Today, the observations of the Peruvian fishermen are still valid, illustrating the link between sea surface temperatures and rainfall patterns.

It is, after all, this coupling between the ocean and the atmosphere that determines the strength of an El Nino.

THE CLIMATIC SEE-SAW

The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean basin on Earth. Unsurprisingly, it is not a uniform body of water, and the differences influence the climate of various regions.

Under normal conditions, the western Pacific is much warmer than the east.

The reason lies in the way the winds blow.

In the tropical Pacific Ocean, winds mainly blow from east to west. These predictable trade winds, as they are known, keeps warm water confined around the maritime continent.

The waters warm as they move across the Pacific Ocean, eventually pooling around the maritime continent. Says Dr Xie: ""Evaporating warm water fuels the rain clouds in the western part of the tropical Pacific. That explains why Singapore and Indonesia are blessed with a lot of rainfall.""

Things are different in the east.

When the trade winds blow, they push water away from the South American coast. This causes water from the depths of the ocean to well up towards the surface.

Deep waters are cooler, and they contain many nutrients from sinking organic matter.

As they move to the surface, they stimulate the oceanic food web. This upwelling is one of the reasons why some of the world's richest fisheries can be found along the South American coast.

But cooler waters also cool the atmosphere above it, causing air to sink and creating an area of high pressure. This makes it harder for rain clouds to form.

When an El Nino hits, on average every three to four years, it disrupts this status quo. Scientists believe the weakening of the trade winds may be what kick-starts this process, although the exact trigger is still being studied.

As the trade winds weaken, the pool of warm water in the west is no longer confined to that region, and a tongue of warm water now extends from west to east.

As the warm water moves towards the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, the rain clouds follow.

Related Story Hard to predict severity of El Nino events

Reducing impact of extreme events

More warm water in the east pushes the cooler waters to deeper depths, and what upwells to the surface is warm water. This reinforces the original change, and is why El Nino impacts can stretch over months.

As the oceans warm and heavy rain falls, native wildlife in the eastern Pacific can be severely affected.

In the Galapagos Islands, birthplace of Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution, the population of the world's only equator-dwelling penguins was almost wiped out in the aftermath of the 1982 El Nino.

The event had cut off the supply of nutrient-rich deep, cool water, causing a collapse of the oceanic food web and organisms reliant on it, such as the penguins.

Says Charles Darwin Research Station sea bird researcher Gustavo Jimenez: ""On average their numbers range between 2,000 and 4,000 penguins, but after that event, we counted just 300.""

CLIMATE CHANGE LINK

El Nino, with its wide reach across the Pacific Ocean and beyond, has affected human lives, livelihoods and biodiversity.

Assistant Professor Winston Chow, a climate scientist at the National University of Singapore, says there are certain analogies to climate change that can be drawn from these events.

""Some aspects, such as increased atmospheric warmth and sea surface temperatures, can be useful examples of equivalent climate change conditions,"" says Prof Chow, who is also a lead author for an upcoming report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

El Nino events provide a natural ""stress test"" to see how human and natural systems deal with the changes, and the adaptation measures that can be taken, he says.

Ciifen's Mr Martinez agrees, saying: ""If we prepare for the impacts of El Nino, we are also working to mitigate the impacts of extreme events, which are the strongest evidence of climate change.""

Singapore, for instance, is preparing to deal with drought by investing in weatherproof sources of water, such as desalination, and Newater, or recycled used water.

Other countries, such as Indonesia and the Galapagos Islands - ground zero for El Nino - are doing the same, as The Sunday Times recently discovered on two reporting trips across the Pacific Ocean.

One strategy for both archipelagos is the protection of natural ecosystems, such as sprawling tropical rainforests and peatlands, and pristine habitats on the Galapagos.

Says Mr Martinez: ""In our experience, grey infrastructure does not solve the problem. They just shift the impact somewhere else.""

Seawalls built along a river, for example, may protect a city from being flooded, but not an area further downstream. ""However if you manage the degradation of the riverine ecosystem, if you keep the vegetation, the river can retain water better, reducing the possibility of floods overall,"" says Mr Martinez.

The interconnectedness of the global climate system and economy all point to the importance of climate action by all.

Says climate scientist Michael Mann from the Pennsylvania State University: ""El Nino touches just about every continent, including the United States, Eurasia, Africa, Australia. And because we live in an interconnected global economy, extreme impacts in one region can... cause global spikes in prices of commodities and food.""

Indeed, Dr Xie notes that models used to project the intensity of El Nino have been inconsistent.

But what is clearer is how climate change will affect rainfall patterns - a major impact of El Nino, says Dr Xie.

He says: ""During El Nino years, countries in the West Pacific could experience drier weather that could lead to droughts and wildfires, whereas those in the central and eastern Pacific could experience more rain - causing flash floods and the spread of diseases.""

Natural El Nino events can change rainfall patterns drastically - but so can human-caused climate change.

The IPCC had in its latest report highlighted precipitation variability and extremes as a key risk that could affect food insecurity and other aspects of human life.

In a way, the impacts of severe El Nino events offer a glimpse into what things could be like in a warming world.

There is, however, a key difference.

While the effects of El Nino are temporary, usually ending after a few months, unabated global warming could well drive permanent change and destruction.","Sun, 09 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/media-brightcove/6044290000001.jpg,"['impact', 'nino', 'ocean', 'warm', 'winds', 'changing', 'water', 'climate', 'change', 'peek', 'world', 'pacific', 'rainfall', 'el']",

Built on hills made of a fine, silt-like soil, the camps near the Cox's Bazar district are particularly prone to landslides and flash floods, meaning downpours can wreak havoc on the successive waves of Rohingya refugees who have taken shelter there. As Cyclone Fani approached, both refugees and the many agencies that manage the camps watched nervously as the storm veered west, largely missing Cox's Bazar, but causing extensive damage in India and western Bangladesh.

The episode would serve as a precursor to the potentially catastrophic events that lie ahead. Now, as monsoon season begins in Bangladesh, massive earth-moving projects that have been undertaken over the last year to reinforce camp settlements against the worst weather conditions will be put to the test.

Many of the homes constructed in Kutupalong Camp are highly vulnerable to landslides in heavy rains

Working side by side with local residents and NGOs, Rohingya refugees have been taking part in a program as paid laborers to build roads, bridges, drainage systems and reinforcement walls. Known as the Site Maintenance Engineering Project (SMEP), the program seeks to address critical infrastructure issues in the camps, most of which were hastily built in 2017 as over 700,000 refugees fled ethnic violence in Myanmar.

""These slopes are not stable, at any moment you could have a landslide,"" said Mosa Alshalabi, an engineer with the World Food Programme (WFP), which is coordinating the program with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

Reinforcing terrain, relocating people

Alshalabi oversees the many construction crews that are chopping hills in half, making graded terraces of their slopes and reinforcing them with treated-bamboo retention walls. Native vegetation is then planted on the terraces to help hold the soil together. In recent months, several new camps have been built in this manner, allowing Rohingya families to relocate to safer shelters than those initially built as the crisis unfolded.

""We call it 'decongesting the camps,'"" Alshalabi told DW. ""Almost 25,000 people have been relocated into the camp 20 and camp 4 extensions. But the old camps are so densely populated that it doesn't seem like that many people moved.""

Taken together, the Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar are the largest refugee settlement in the world. A report by Human Rights Watch published in August 2018 found the camp to be severely overcrowded, with an average usable space of just 10.7 square meters per person. The report called for Rohingya refugees to be relocated to safer areas outside the camps, but the long-term prospects of hosting the displaced community has become a contentious subject in Bangladeshi politics.

Government officials continue to put pressure on Myanmar to repatriate Rohingya refugees and, in viewing their stay as temporary, have banned the use of permanent construction materials in the camps, compounding existing infrastructure problems.

Public works for public needs

Yet for the time being, earthmoving projects continue and, in the process, provide much needed employment for camp residents, who are neither permitted to work nor attend schools. Several thousand Rohingya refugees have signed up to participate in the program and are paid roughly $5 (€4.5) for an eight-hour workday, the minimum wage in Bangladesh. Among them is Mohamed Elias, a 35-year-old refugee who has been living in the camps since 2017.

""During the rainy season, it gets very wet here,"" Elias said as he worked to level out a terrace. ""The soil breaks down easily and the hills collapse, so what we are doing now will protect our homes … it also feels good to work.""

Navin Karki, a site management officer, points out new drainage ways installed in the camps to help mitigate rain damage

Rohingya females also take part in the infrastructure projects and compose about 30% of the total workforce. Roshida Begum, a mother of four whose husband was killed in Myanmar, said she waters vegetation on the terraces in the morning, carries soil to construction sites in the afternoon, and cooks meals for her children during breaks.

""The salary has helped me buy many things like cooking oil, rice and additional food to supplement the food aid we are getting,"" Begum told DW.

""In Myanmar, the security situation was not good for Rohingya, but in Bangladesh they are quite good at keeping us safe,"" she continued. ""The food rations go up and down, but security is good.""

Constant threats, constant preparation

Though Cyclone Fani spared the camps, the first major rainfall to hit Cox's Bazar this season affected 170 shelters, displacing a number of families, according to Gemma Snowdon, a communications officer for WFP. In addition to the SMEP preparations, constant work is needed to maintain reinforcement walls and humanitarian workers have been setting up storm shelters, as well as, providing cyclone preparedness training courses.

In recent months, Navin Karki, a site management officer for IOM, has also been distributing ""tie-down kits"" to help secure rooftops and minimize storm damage. He expressed fears financial support for such measures would diminish with time as the initial emergency response turns into a protracted crisis.

""If there is a lack of support from the international community, then it will be very difficult for everyone to continue their daily activities because these projects require constant upkeep,"" Karki told DW. ""The need here is huge.""

50,50,FL-2019-000057-IDN,Malaysia's Artificial Island Construction Plans Spell Disaster For The Environment And Locals - The Organization for World Peace,https://theowp.org/malaysias-artificial-island-construction-plans-spell-disaster-for-the-environment-and-locals/,"The plan by the state government of Penang to construct artificial islands off the southern coast of the Malaysian state has been met with heavy criticism based on environmental and food security concerns. The three islands covering 1,821 hectares are part of the government’s Penang South Reclamation project (PSR) to fund the state’s economic development, particularly to the execution of the Penang Transport Master Plan (PTMP). The PTMP aims to counter increasing congestion in the area but has been accused of having a disproportionate focus on the construction of highways over more environmentally conscious infrastructure like railways. The reclamation plans have also been accused of jeopardizing the prime fishing grounds of the area and all those whose livelihoods rely on them and as having the potential to cause irreparable environmental harm. If the project is federally approved construction would take between 30 and 50 years and would commence in one to two years.

According to local assemblyman, Yusni Mat Piah, “the public is opposed to the PSR because of the high risks and the negative impact it involves compared to the benefits it might bring.” He also called the commitment to the plan “suspicious” in light of the lack of transparency that surrounds many aspects of the project in that it “failed to provide satisfactory explanations and clarifications on the project.” The plan had been rejected in 2018 on the basis of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Penang’s chief minister Chow Kon Yeow said the project had since been revised and “significant improvements” had been made but failed to provide details about these improvements. Piah said the most possible outcome of the plans would be the eviction of low-income inhabitants of the area, including local fishermen, as well as the disruption of nature. Chairman of the Fishermen’s Association of Penang Island, Nazri Ahmad, estimated the reclamation plans put about 1,800 fishermen at risk. It is also claimed that sand mining will damage marine breeding spots in northern Perak and reclamation would destroy Penang’s marine life including the endangered Green Turtles and Olive Ridley Turtles that nest in the area. The plan is estimated to generate an additional 3.2 million tons of annual carbon emissions according to the National Physical Planning Council.

The Penang government’s persistence in pushing this plan despite the notable consequences indicates prioritization of profits over its people and irreplaceable environmental resources. The environmental consequences will come at a time when impacts of climate change are being felt in the form of increasing floods and landslides in Penang and reflect significant recklessness on the part of the government.

Massive reclamation projects have been underway around Penang since 1975 and their consequences are clear. For example, in the north, the Seri Tanjung Pinang project has entered its second phase, “decimating the local fisheries and debilitating the nearby villages which depend on them” according to a Forbes report. The Tanjung Bungah Residents’ Association has linked recent reports about heavy metal pollution and rising toxicity levels in the sea of Penang as linked to the northern project.

The project evidently has both localized and global impacts and its progress should, therefore, be reconsidered and more sustainable management solutions that balance coastal development and the needs of the environment and locals. Prime minister Mahathir Mohamad should act immediately to stop the potentially catastrophic outcomes linked to the project and address the varied and valid concerns of the public and NGOs. The Malaysian government’s policy of indifference to the environment must be reconsidered before it is too late to retrieve the invaluable resources in the area.","Mon, 10 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg,"['construction', 'island', 'locals', 'plans', 'project', 'spell', 'linked', 'governments', 'penang', 'environment', 'disaster', 'plan', 'reclamation', 'area', 'local', 'malaysias', 'artificial', 'environmental']",

Footage shows a group of barefooted teenagers from a boarding school in eastern Indonesia playing the dangerous game of 'fire football' on June 1.

While spectators are heard screaming during the nighttime match, the fearless players dribble the blazing ball across a yard in Probolinggo and score the occasional goal.

Although the players make plenty of contact with the fiery ball, at no point do any of them catch fire, thankfully.

53,53,FL-2019-000057-IDN,Guest Article: Tackling the Hidden Toll of Disasters in Asia and the Pacific | SDG Knowledge Hub | IISD - IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/tackling-the-hidden-toll-of-disasters-in-asia-and-the-pacific/,"Developing countries in Asia are, sadly, often the hardest hit by the increasing number of disasters worldwide. The region is home to more than 80% of about 206 million people affected by disasters globally each year. It also accounts for more than half of the world’s 60,000 disaster fatalities each year. The December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami alone killed more than 200,000 people while the May 2008 earthquake in Wenchuan, China, left more than 87,000 people dead.

The situation stands to become even more perilous in the years ahead. Climate change is causing more frequent and more intense natural hazards while rapid socioeconomic development means more homes, businesses, and infrastructure are under threat. This “perfect storm” has made Asia and the Pacific more vulnerable than ever.

The images of dramatic rescues during these harrowing disasters are well known, and the progress in swiftly rebuilding the damaged areas has been impressive of late, contributing to implementation of SDG target 13.1 on strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters. But an often-neglected aspect is the indirect human and economic toll that is still felt years, even decades, after the disaster. This has far-reaching impacts on sustainable development in the region, and compromises the achievement of many SDGs ranging from SDG 1 on poverty and SDG 2 on combating hunger right through to SDG 15 which seeks to protect life on land.

Typhoons have been linked to higher infant mortality among baby girls in the Philippines up to two years after the original incident. Children who lost parents to the tsunami in Indonesia spent less time in school as they assumed parenting duties to younger siblings. Lower nutrition during lean drought years in India has led to low-weight newborns or stunting. In these ways, the fallout of disasters creates barriers to countries reaching the targets of SDG 4 on quality education and SDG 3 on good health and well-being.

Disaster impacts can also transmit far beyond the disaster epicenter through temporary migration or permanent resettlement. Rural populations fleeing to cities after floods or droughts can spark social disorder or conflict while displaced populations can find themselves exposed to other hazards, such as epidemics, that they could have avoided at home.

Disruptions to global value chains mean disaster impacts also reverberate beyond the affected area as companies are unable to supply crucial goods to buyers elsewhere in the country or even beyond. The March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan and flooding in Thailand later the same year caused local production stoppages that forced firms in the US and Europe that relied on the Japanese or Thai intermediate goods to also slow production. Cracks in the supply chain are estimated to have caused a 1.2% decline in Japan’s gross domestic product (GDP) in the year after the earthquake.

Natural hazards cannot be prevented, but disasters can be controlled. Asia and the Pacific can protect its most vulnerable people through preventative measures. This includes restoring mangrove forests – a co-benefit for SDG 15 which seeks to reverse land degradation and protect biodiversity – and building cyclone shelters, for example. Comprehensive disaster risk financing and insurance strategies, such as those in the Philippines and Indonesia, also help.

Building strong, more resilient infrastructure is the most direct way to lessen the impact of disasters. Developing economies in Asia need to spend around USD 26 trillion on infrastructure between 2016 and 2030. This should be spent on building durable infrastructure. But the region also needs to limit developments in high-risk areas by, for one, extending road networks inland rather than along exposed shores.

This investment in infrastructure would not only make the region safer from future disasters, it would unleash untapped development potential and a broader array of co-benefits. Early warning systems help citizens prepare for an impending hazard but they also can be used to help farmers and businesses make better decisions about sowing crops or construction. Improved waste management keeps water ways clear during flooding but also cuts health risks from poor waste disposal. Evacuation centers shelter citizens from typhoons or storms, and otherwise can act as community centers to promote the accumulation of social capital.

Asia and the Pacific must continue to respond to disasters with immediate life-saving aid and reconstruction of the directly affected areas. But the region should also capitalize on the wide-ranging benefits offered by preparing early for the highly damaging ripple effects of disasters.

56,56,FL-2019-000057-IDN,Foreign insurers bring disruption in untapped Myanmar market - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-trends/Foreign-insurers-bring-disruption-in-untapped-Myanmar-market,"YANGON -- Myanmar's insurance market will soon face a sea change led by technologies and expertise brought in by foreign companies.

A total of 14 foreign insurers will enter the Southeast Asian country's market by the end of this year through either wholly owned subsidiaries or joint venture companies with local peers, the Nikkei Asian Review has learned.

A greater variety of insurance products is expected to appear as Myanmar's government plans to open its insurance market to foreign companies and ease regulations simultaneously, making it possible to use information obtained through the latest technologies such as artificial intelligence and satellites.

""I don't have any insurance. I have been living for 38 years without insurance and I don't think I need it,"" said Nyi Nyi, a 38-year-old man working at a company in Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city. For many locals, it has been standard practice to cope with risks without insurance.

If they fall ill, they make do with painkillers and traditional medicines available at pharmacies. If they cause a traffic accident, they settle out of court by paying compensation within their ability to do so.

Myanmar has an estimated population of 54 million. The insurance penetration rate -- the ratio of premium income to gross domestic product -- is extremely low there, compared with its neighbors in Southeast Asia.

The rate in Myanmar stood at 0.24% in 2018 -- 0.19% for general insurance and 0.05% for life insurance -- much lower than 0.79% in Cambodia, whose per capita GDP is at the same level as Myanmar and which opened its insurance market to foreign competition earlier.

This is the biggest reason Myanmar's insurance market is considered promising. The foreign insurers could open the curtain on a new era.

In January, the Myanmar government launched the process to open up its market to foreign insurers. In April, five foreign life insurers, including AIA, Manulife and Prudential, were allowed to enter the market through wholly owned subsidiaries.

Anil Wadhwani, president and CEO of Manulife Asia, welcomed the government's decision to embrace foreign insurers in the market.

""The move to open up Myanmar's insurance market is a step in the right direction,"" he said, adding that it will be ""instrumental in spurring the country's ongoing development, boosting competition and driving greater insurance penetration.""

The government will also permit the establishment of joint ventures with local companies, limiting the foreign ownership to below 35%. The Nikkei Asian Review has confirmed that four foreign life insurers and five foreign general insurers have applied to the government to establish joint ventures with local companies.

The authorities are currently screening the applications and the results will be announced by the end of July, one applicant said. His application as well as other insurers' will be accepted by the end of July, unless something unexpected happens, he said.

Foreign insurers have waited for the market to open up for nearly five years. In 2013, the country lifted a ban on private insurers as part of economic reforms associated with the transition to civilian rule. A year later, the government allowed three Japanese insurers to do business in the Thilawa special economic zone, near Yangon, without local partners, hinting at a future full-scale opening of the market.

The entry of foreign insurers brings capital investment, new technology and operational know-how to Myanmar's insurance market. They are likely to include efficient delivery of insurance services to many customers, as well as innovative insurance products that apply data gathered through latest technologies.

""We will deploy digital tools and services on the front end, supported by automated processes and systems at the back end,"" Nic Nicandrou, chief executive of Prudential Corporation Asia, told the Nikkei Asian Review. ""We intend to embrace a digital-led, customer-centric strategy in Myanmar to broaden access to life insurance and provide a seamless end-to-end experience to customers.""

The British insurer has life insurance operations in 12 markets in Asia and holds the top three positions in eight of them, including Laos and Cambodia, where the company established its operations in 2016 and 2013. Similar to these emerging markets, Prudential ""will start off by offering simple-to-understand and affordable protection and savings products, targeting the masses,"" Nicandrou said. ""Technology is a key focus for us.""

As an example, Nicandrou revealed a plan to bring in AI technology to customers in the region. ""We will soon be launching our new all-in-one mobile application in Asia, beginning with Malaysia this year. It will be the first app of its kind to offer AI-powered health information to millions of people in the region including Myanmar, empowering them to take control of their health and well-being anytime, anywhere,"" he said.

Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Insurance aims to sell to Myanmar farmers a product that covers income shortfalls due to droughts and floods, using satellite imagery to determine the extent of damage. The company has applied to the government for a license to establish a joint venture with AYA Myanmar Insurance, affiliated with Myanmar's second largest bank.

The weather index insurance product the Japanese company aims to introduce uses precipitation data based on imagery taken by remote sensing satellites, in determining insurance payments. By paying a low premium for the policy, farmers stand to receive insurance money if they are judged to have suffered from a drought or flood, so they could receive compensation for their income shortfalls. Satellite data will be prepared in a way that allows the insurers to set objective judgment criteria in a country like Myanmar, where ground-level precipitation data is not readily available.

In a joint effort with state-run Myanma Insurance and Myanma Agricultural Development Bank, Sompo Japan is currently running a pilot project to test the weather index insurance in two rural location of the country. Keiji Okada, chief representative of Sompo Japan's Yangon office, said the Myanmar government appears ready to allow insurance companies to use banks and microfinance providers as sales channels for the product.

""The use of insurance is going to spread to farmers and small businesses vulnerable to abnormal weather conditions,"" Okada said. ""Financial services will become more inclusive.""

Digital technology plays an important role in the joint endeavor, as ""it increases flexibility in terms of distribution channels,"" according to AYA Myanmar Managing Director Myo Min Thu.

""If the government allows us to distribute insurance through bank branches, microfinance institutions or mobile digital channels, it will be easier to distribute small-ticket size insurance to the masses at the lower end,"" Myo Min Thu said.","Wed, 12 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F5%252F1%252F2%252F7%252F21177215-1-eng-GB%252FIMG_3100%2520%25E3%2581%25AE%25E3%2582%25B3%25E3%2583%2594%25E3%2583%25BC.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['end', 'bring', 'foreign', 'joint', 'open', 'disruption', 'untapped', 'insurance', 'insurers', 'myanmar', 'yangon', 'myanmars', 'market']",

Big news! KFC released fried chicken skin on the menu at locations in Indonesia

Exciting: Fried chicken skin was first announced on KFC Indonesia's Twitter page

KFC Indonesia's Twitter page first announced the new menu item in a tweet.

The tweet listed the six locations in the country — MT Haryono, Salemba, Cideng, Kemang, Kalimalang and Kelapa Gading — that would be featuring the chicken skins on the menu.

So far, reports on the flavor have been mixed. Some consumers have described the fried chicken skin as 'too salty' while other have said there isn't enough seasoning to the product, The Sun reports.

But one consumer heaped on the praise for the new menu item and said 'it tastes spicy savory'.

They continued: 'It's different to what you'd expect as it's not the same as normal chicken skin, but the first bite is good. It's really crisp and crunchy! I'll definitely order again as a snack.'

Facebook users have also reported seeing the fried chicken skin on menus in Thailand, but KFC has not revealed any plans to bring the menu item west.

The fast-food chain recently made headlines for reports it was also considering creating a plant-based fried chicken for the menu.

The father-of-two, married to wife Julie, grinned for the camera as he was hugged by a woman in a short red dress at a disco during a golf charity trip.

Julie's mother today said she hadn't seen the pictures of Atkinson and his pals' jolly to Indonesia but said the 48–year-old official would never stray offside.

Speaking from her home in Newcastle Carol Parmley, 68, vowed: 'I will have a word with him.'

A group of Premier League referees enjoyed a boozy night out with a group of young women in Indonesia. Kevin Friend (second right), Martin Atkinson second left), Andre Marriner (back centre) and David Coote (left) were seen at the Brewski & Co bar in th party district of Batam

Married ref Marriner (right) was seen at a disco with a woman sitting on his knee while his colleague Atkinson (left) was hugged from behind by a young woman wearing a red dress

Atkinson and his wife Julie live in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, and have two children together. Julie's mother Carol said she will be 'having a word' with the Premier League referee

She said she had not spoken to daughter Julie about the photographs showing young women draped around Atkinson and his pals, adding: 'She's been away on holiday, I haven't heard from her about it.'

But Mrs Parmley added: 'I cannot imagine Martin flirting with anybody or doing anything that is not right if that is what is being insinuated.'

Atkinson was on the night out with fellow Premier League referees Kevin Friend, Andre Marriner and David Coote.

His colleague Marriner, a father-of-one, was filmed in a disco sitting a woman on his knee with both arms tightly wrapped around her waist. On the video Marriner was seen poking his tongue into her ear.

David Coote, 36 — the only unmarried man in the six-strong party — held a woman as they gyrated in a nightclub.

Kevin Friend's father Doug today dismissed his son's night of high-jinx as just a bit of harmless fun and dismissed any suggestion that he was in the doghouse with wife Rachel (pictured)

And Kevin Friend, who refereed the FA Cup Final at Wembley last month, was seen whispering into a woman's ear.

Friend's father leapt to his son's defence, insisting the night out was 'just a bit of harmless fun'.

Doug Friend, a retired army sergeant, dismissed any suggestion that the father-of-one was in the doghouse with wife Rachel.

Speaking from his home in Leicestershire, the 75-year-old, who served for 25 years with the Royal Corps of Signals, said: 'It's rubbish. It was not like it appeared. It was just a bit of harmless fun, all very innocent.

'It's turned into a witch hunt. What the referees including Kevin have done is help kids in the orphanage.

'They went out with some orphanage staff and some people from the hotel, just to say thank you. Most of the girls were married. There is nothing in it whatsoever.'

Doug admitted the allegations had been upsetting but insisted his family would come through it.

He added: 'His wife Rachel is very supportive. We are a great family. A supportive family, but it is very upsetting when you see rubbish like that.'

And he said his son would not get any more stick than usual from football fans following the newspaper stories.

'Refs, always get a bad time anyway. That's just football.'

Marriner's mother-in-law also jumped to his defence today and said wasn't in any trouble with his wife, Lisa.

Rita Daffern said: 'Nothing happened. They had a meal, they had a dance and they came home. That's the end of it.'

The group stayed last week at the luxury Radisson Hotel, linked to the golf resort.

The resort boasted of their presence on its Facebook page and they took part in a two-day golf tournament.

Andre Marriner's (right) mother-in-law said the referee wasn't in any trouble with his wife Lisa (left). Rita Daffern said that the group went for a meal, had a dance and they came home

They visited an orphanage on behalf of Atkinson's Whistle Stop Tour charity and handed out bicycle helmets. The trip raised money for Indonesian children and a UK hospice, and the refs are believed to have paid for it themselves.

On Thursday night all six posed for photos with six women at Brewski & Co bar in Batam's Nagoya Entertainment District, infamous for its red light district.

The women later shared pics and videos of them dancing at The Square Club and KTV, a three-mile taxi ride away.

The refs are thought to have flown home on Friday.

""If we don't borrow, Laos, as a least-developed country, won't develop further,"" Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith told the Nikkei Asian Review in an interview on the sidelines of Nikkei's Future of Asia conference in Tokyo.

A key focus of concern is an ambitious railway project.

Laos signed a memorandum of understanding with China and Thailand in April on building a stretch of track between Nong Khai in northeastern Thailand and the Laotian capital of Vientiane -- part of China's Belt and Road Initiative. Once connected with existing line construction, the railway would link China and Thailand, passing through Laos.

The Laotian government holds only 30% of a joint company set up with China to build and operate the railway, while China owns the rest, according to Thongloun.

The government has ""its own measures to manage the debt and ensure balance in the public debt sector,"" Thongloun said, insisting Laos sticks to ""high-efficiency projects which are long-term, with low interest rates.""

""The observers who have concern for Laos in terms of debt repayment ... may not have enough or sufficient information on how the government assesses those projects,"" he continued.

Yet some see the railway as a serious risk. In March 2018, the U.S.-based Center for Global Development warned about Laos' dependence on China, listing the Southeast Asian nation among eight countries with the highest ratios of debt to China out of 68 countries funded under the Belt and Road.

The think tank noted that the $6 billion cost of the China-Laos railway represents almost half of Laotian gross domestic product. The International Monetary Fund warned the project ""might threaten [Laos'] ability to service its debts.""

Thongloun also touched on the deadly flooding caused by the collapse of a dam at the Xe Pian Xe Namnoy hydroelectric project last July. He said it was a ""technical error,"" including construction issues, echoing an international expert panel's investigation of the accident.

""We need to make sure from now on that hydropower projects are in compliance with international standards,"" he said, adding that the government has instructed relevant authorities to ensure new and existing projects, as well as dams that are already in operation, meet sufficient safety and technical standards.

Earlier, in a speech to the Future of Asia audience, Thongloun mentioned China's Belt and Road as a valuable new mechanism for international cooperation.

Asia, the prime minister said, is devising new ways for countries to work together as the region takes a bigger role on the world stage, suggesting cooperation is crucial amid persistent U.S.-China tensions and a shifting global power balance.

Thongloun told the conference -- where ""seeking a new global order"" is the main theme this year -- that Asian countries have been ""the initiators of new cooperation mechanisms that are all-encompassing and comprehensive.""

Another example he gave was the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership -- a proposed free trade framework involving the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand.

He said ASEAN, a 10-member bloc that includes Laos, is committed to accelerating the RCEP negotiations, pushing for a deal ""as soon as possible"" in order to promote regional economic integration, trade and investment. This, he stressed, would help narrow development gaps between countries.

The prime minister said such international projects are ""important factors in the process of building a new world order.""

As for how that order should take shape, he argued: ""Any world order should be determined on the basis of participation of all countries. Careful deliberation and considerations by all parties are crucial.""

Through cooperation, Thongloun said, countries will be able to ""overcome complex situations"" and ""handle the challenges"" they now face.

61,61,FL-2019-000057-IDN,Climate change is driving rapid shifts between high and low water levels on the Great Lakes - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/climate-change-is-driving-rapid-shifts-between-high-and-low-water-levels-on-the-great-lakes-118095,"The North American Great Lakes contain about one-fifth of the world’s surface fresh water. In May, new high water level records were set on Lakes Erie and Superior, and there has been widespread flooding across Lake Ontario for the second time in three years. These events coincide with persistent precipitation and severe flooding across much of central North America.

As recently as 2013, water levels on most of the Great Lakes were very low. At that time some experts proposed that climate change, along with other human actions such as channel dredging and water diversions, would cause water levels to continue to decline. This scenario spurred serious concern. Over 30 million people live within the Great Lakes basin, and many depend directly on the lakes for drinking water, industrial use, commercial shipping and recreation.

But since 2014 the issue has been too much water, not too little. High water poses just as many challenges for the region, including shoreline erosion, property damage, displacement of families and delays in planting spring crops. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently declared a state of emergency in response to the flooding around Lake Ontario while calling for better planning decisions in light of climate change.

As researchers specializing in hydrology and climate science, we believe rapid transitions between extreme high and low water levels in the Great Lakes represent the “new normal.” Our view is based on interactions between global climate variability and the components of the regional hydrological cycle. Increasing precipitation, the threat of recurring periods of high evaporation, and a combination of both routine and unusual climate events – such as extreme cold air outbursts – are putting the region in uncharted territory.

Image developed using the online Great Lakes Dashboard (https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/data/dashboard/GLD.html) maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) and the University of Michigan Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) , CC BY-ND

Calculating the lakes’ water budget

Current water levels on the Great Lakes are setting records. Lake Superior, the largest freshwater lake on Earth by surface area, surpassed its record of 602.82 feet for the month of May, and is poised to set a new record for the month of June. Lake Erie, the world’s ninth largest lake by surface area, surpassed not only its record water level for the month of May, but also its all-time monthly water level record of 574.28 feet, which has stood since June 1986.

These extremes result from changes in the Great Lakes’ water budget – the movement of water into and out of the lakes. Water levels across the lakes fluctuate over time, influenced mainly by three factors: rain and snowfall over the lakes, evaporation over the lakes, and runoff that enters each lake from the surrounding land through tributaries and rivers. Runoff is directly affected by precipitation over land, snow cover and soil moisture.

Interactions between these factors drive changes in the amount of water stored in each of the Great Lakes. For example, in the late 1990s surface water temperatures on Lakes Superior and Michigan-Huron rose by roughly 2 degrees C. Water evaporates more rapidly when it is warmer, and during this period evaporation rates were nearly 30% above annual average levels. Water levels on Lake Michigan-Huron dropped to the lowest levels ever recorded.

Then in 2014 the Midwest experienced an extraordinary cold air outbreak, widely dubbed the “polar vortex.” The lakes froze and evaporation rates dropped. As a result, water levels surged.

At roughly the same time, precipitation was increasing. The 2017 Lake Ontario flood followed a spring of extreme overland precipitation in the Lake Ontario and Saint Lawrence River basins. The 2019 flood follows the wettest U.S. winter in history.

What do these trends mean for water levels? In addition to the current onset of record highs, water levels in Lake Erie have been rising earlier in spring and declining earlier in fall. More winter precipitation is falling, often as snow. The snow is melting earlier in response to rising temperatures and shorter winters. The resulting runoff is then amplified in years like 2019 with large springtime rains. The net effect of this combination of hydrological events is that Lake Erie’s current water levels are much higher than usual for this time of year.

The role of climate change

Great Lakes water levels have varied in the past, so how do we know whether climate change is a factor in the changes taking place now?

Precipitation increases in winter and spring are consistent with the fact that a warming atmosphere can transport more water vapor. Converting water from vapor to liquid and ice releases energy. As a result, increased atmospheric moisture contributes to more precipitation during extreme events. That is, when weather patterns are wet, they are very wet.

Changes in seasonal cycles of snowmelt and runoff align with the fact that spring is coming earlier in a changing climate. Climate models project that this trend will continue. Similarly, rising lake temperatures contribute to increased evaporation. When weather patterns are dry, this produces lower lake levels.

Wet and dry periods are influenced by storm tracks, which are related to global-scale processes such as El Niño. Similarly, cold air outbreaks are related to the Arctic Oscillation and associated shifts in the polar jet stream. These global patterns often have indirect effects on Great Lakes weather. It is uncertain how these relationships will change as the planet warms.

Tools for better forecasts

Rapid changes in weather and water supply conditions across the Great Lakes and upper Midwest are already challenging water management policy, engineering infrastructure and human behavior. We are undoubtedly observing the effects of a warming climate in the Great Lakes, but many questions remain to be answered.

The Great Lakes are, collectively, a critical water resource. Government agencies and weather forecasters need new tools to assess how future climate conditions may affect the Great Lakes water budget and water levels, along with better shorter-term forecasts that capture changing conditions.

Innovative techniques, such as incorporating information from snow and soil moisture maps into seasonal water supply forecasts, can help capture a full picture of what is happening to the water budget. The bigger point is that past conditions around the Great Lakes are not a reliable basis for decision-making that will carry into the future.","Tue, 04 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/277753/original/file-20190603-69059-1f5p79o.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C138%2C3197%2C1598&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['weather', 'rapid', 'driving', 'lakes', 'low', 'precipitation', 'levels', 'great', 'water', 'climate', 'high', 'spring', 'record', 'shifts', 'lake']",

KUALA LUMPUR: The recent announcement by the United States that several Southeast Asian partner nations will receive unmanned surveillance drones has garnered some interest, particularly given the deterioration in relations between the US and China over security and trade issues.

The US Department of Defense (DoD) announced last week that Insitu Inc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of aerospace giant Boeing, had been awarded a US$47 million contract for 34 ScanEagle drones to Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam.

The US government Foreign Military Sales (FMS) contract also provides for support to recipients, which includes spare payloads, spare and repair parts, support equipment, tools, training, technical services, and field service representatives, with work expected to be completed in 2022.



The drones will be provided to these countries using funds from the US government, although there are conflicting reports on whether these come under the DoD’s capacity building programme for partner nations or from the funding under the maritime security initiative announced by the US in 2015.

WHAT IS THE SCANEAGLE?

The ScanEagle is an unarmed drone used for surveillance and intelligence gathering roles. The current model, the ScanEagle 2, which has a maximum take-off weight of 26kg, a length of 1.71m and wingspan of 3.11m, is classified as a small unmanned aircraft system in industry parlance.

Although unarmed, it can carry a 5kg surveillance payload, comprising of electro-optic, infrared, and high-resolution video cameras that enable the operator to track stationary and moving targets.

Performance-wise, the drone cruises at a relatively modest cruise speed of 93 to 111 kmh and has a maximum operating altitude of just below 6km although it has an ability to stay in the air for up to 18 hours.

Manufacturer Insitu has developed a pneumatic catapult unit to launch the ScanEagle,. At the end of a mission, the drone is recovered by a Skyhook system developed by the manufacturer whereby a wing-mounted hook catches onto a vertically strung cable.

The ScanEagle has been a popular choice, being operated by militaries all across the globe, with Australia, Lithuania, Pakistan and the United Kingdom among its users. It is also in use by the Republic of Singapore Navy, which has launched from a variety of ships including its missile corvettes.

IS IT FOR USE IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA?



The fact that all the countries in the recipient list in the latest announcement have interests in the South China Sea, with Indonesia being the only country that does not claim ownership of any of the islands, features and rocks of the disputed Spratly or Paracels groups, has not escaped notice.



Also significant was the fact that this was the time American equipment with an overt military purpose will be transferred to Vietnam since an American arms embargo, in place since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, was fully lifted in 2016.

It was previously announced that Vietnam will receive some US-built patrol boats, but these unarmed vessels were earmarked for the coast guard and not the military.

The drones will assist the recipient countries in improving Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) over their territorial waters and exclusive economic zones. The International Maritime Organisation defines MDA as the effective understanding of all areas “on, under, relating to, adjacent to, or bordering on a sea, ocean, or other navigable waterway” that could impact the security, safety, economy, or environment of a country.

With a lot having already been written about the importance of maritime-based commerce and activities like fishing to regional economies, it goes without saying how important MDA is to authorities in these littoral states.

However, the more cynical might be inclined to think of this as the latest example of American assertiveness in the region, particularly given ongoing US-China tensions, and the Trump Administration’s announced intentions to boost US weapons exports.

But this would be a rather simplistic and not-too-accurate way of seeing things. While there would be quite a lot of capabilities one would need to bring to an outright confrontation involving the dispute in the South China Sea or an assertion of presence there, given China’s increasingly powerful military, ScanEagles will not be high on that list.

In fact, it would be a risky proposition to use them against any reasonably well-equipped opponent given its modest performance specifications which would leave it vulnerable to air defences.

MARITIME CHALLENGES FACING SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTRIES

Indeed, there are a whole host of MDA challenges that recipient nations have to contend with, in not just the South China Sea but also the Straits of Malacca, Sulu Sea and beyond.

The two main issues that have been in the headlines are terrorism in southern Philippines and piracy in the Straits of Malacca, Straits of Singapore and South China Sea, as well as other maritime challenges Southeast Asia littoral states need to confront including illegal fishing, human trafficking, fuel theft, smuggling and other transnational crime.

The Royal Thai Navy captured five illegal fishing boats and arrested 43 Vietnamese fishermen after a 12-hour operation in April 2015. (Photo: CNA)

Given that these nations have navies and coast guards that are at best, stretched and at worst, severely under-resourced, having a drone that can stay aloft for 18 hours is a definite advantage in combating these myriad maritime challenges.

Even a small number of ScanEagles can make outsized contribution to improving the MDA capabilities of these littoral states.

The small operating footprint of the ScanEagle is another key advantage, as it means that the drone can be operated from any patch of open space or from onboard a ship, negating the need for a runway.

Operating at that altitude also means its sensors can see farther than that of a ship sailing on the water’s surface, improving the available coverage area.

The capabilities of these modern optical sensors were demonstrated clearly during last week’s near-miss between a Russian and US warship in the Philippine Sea, when the US navy released a number of still photographs of the encounter that was grabbed from a video shot from a sensor mounted onboard an aircraft.

The photos were clear enough to easily identify the ships, even though data on the image showed that it was shot from a 3.35km altitude and 37km away. While the sensors mounted on the ScanEagles are likely to be of more modest capabilities, they would still nevertheless be useful for this intended purpose.



From a strategic perspective, the decision to equip Southeast Asian recipient nations with the ScanEagles will also serve to demonstrate that the US remains committed to the security to its allies and partners in the region by taking a relatively inexpensive measure to make a difference in a vital area, without looking like it was a move designed to antagonise China.

Bukele was sworn in by the speaker of the National Assembly in a square in downtown San Salvador, as a large, boisterous crowd applauded and shouted ""We did it!""

The telegenic Bukele, 37, was elected in February to succeed Salvador Sanchez Ceren, a leftist former guerrilla who maintained close relations with his Nicaraguan and Venezuelan counterparts.

Bukele has said he will seek closer ties with the United States, home to 2.5 million Salvadorans.

With only 6.6 million people living in the small Central American country, its fortunes are closely linked to the United States which nearly a third of its citizens call home.

""I will be the president of all Salvadorans,"" Bukele pledged.

""Our country is like a sick child, we all have to take care of it.""

US President Donald Trump, who has railed against the waves of migrants flooding into his country from El Salvador as well as Honduras and Guatemala, wished Bukele well on Twitter.

""Congratulations President Bukele on your inauguration! The United States stands ready to work with @NayibBukele to advance prosperity in El Salvador and the hemisphere,"" Trump said.

Official estimates indicate an average of 200 Salvadorans leave the country per day to enter the United States without documents.

Some analysts have called Bukele a millennial president: above all because he is at ease on social media, but also because he often adopts a casual appearance, ditching a tie and wearing his hair in a ponytail.

Critics say Bukele, former mayor of the capital San Salvador, is light on policy and substance.

He has said a priority of his five-year term is cracking down on gangs that recruit young people into their ranks, while profiting off drug trafficking and extortion.

El Salvador last year tallied 3,340 homicides. That was 15 percent less than in 2017, but still amounted to a rate of 51 killings per 100,000 inhabitants, making it one of the world's most violent countries not at war.

The fearsome gangs, with an estimated 70,000 members, are blamed for much of the violence.

The son of a Muslim imam and a Christian, Bukele describes himself as believing in God rather than an adherent to a religion, an apparent effort to steer clear of any anti-Muslim sentiment.

Delegations from 83 countries attended Bukele's swearing-in.

67,67,FL-2019-000057-IDN,Why Pakistan Needs Environmentalism – LobeLog - LobeLog,https://lobelog.com/why-pakistan-needs-environmentalism/,"by Austin Bodetti

Pakistan has to contend with a long list of threats to its national security, including the recurring spillover from an endless conflict in Afghanistan, the growing risks of a simmering rivalry with India, and the ever-looming possibility that al-Qaeda, the Pakistani Taliban, or little-known Baloch separatists will attempt a comeback in the Pakistani hinterland. The pernicious effects of climate change, however, seem to play little role in the South Asian country’s security policy. Nonetheless, environmental degradation may have no less alarming consequences for Pakistan’s future than nuclear warfare or terrorism.

“Pakistan’s climate-change concerns include increased variability in monsoons, the likely impact of receding Himalayan glaciers on the Indus River system, the decreased capacity of water reservoirs, reduced hydropower during drought years, and extreme events such as floods and droughts,” says Ahmad Naeem Salik, a research fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad. “For Pakistan, water scarcity is one of the biggest security challenges arising out of the climate change issue.”

The Pakistani Council of Research in Water Resources, a Pakistani government agency, worries that Pakistan will deplete its water supply as soon as 2025. The International Monetary Fund has echoed these concerns, adding that Pakistan’s explosive population growth has exacerbated water scarcity.

Global warming is worsening Pakistan’s host of environmental issues, already beginning to hit the South Asian country with deadly heat waves. The same startling phenomenon is threatening coastal cities in much of North Africa and Western Asia, causing scientists to warn the international community that “prolonged heat waves and desert dust storms can render some regions uninhabitable.”

“The most serious environmental issues in Pakistan encompass poor sanitation—responsible for about 40 percent of hospitalizations and the stunted growth of 43 percent of Pakistani children—and the overuse, misuse, and abuse of the water resources of the Indus River, which has degraded the food basket of the country and the Indus River Delta,” says Syed Ayub Qutub, executive director of the Pakistan Institute for Environment Development Action Research. “Others range from degradation of upland watersheds in the active monsoon zone to indoor air pollution from unvented cook stoves.”

Climate change has aggravated monsoons in Pakistan. As far back as 2010, they flooded one-fifth of the South Asian country and forced millions of Pakistanis from their homes. A monsoon last summer devastated Lahore, leading to six deaths. While tensions between India and Pakistan dominate headlines, news agencies have rarely paid attention to Pakistan’s often-existential battle with global warming.

Sounding the Alarm

In response to a lack of interest from the news media, Pakistani environmentalists are starting to sound the alarm about environmental degradation themselves, penning frantic op-eds such as, “Wake up, environmentalists!” One of the most prominent Pakistani environmentalists, Malik Amin Aslam, has even found his way into the Pakistani Cabinet as the latest head of the Pakistani Climate Change Ministry. The environmental movement in Pakistan has lauded Aslam’s nomination while continuing to offer proposals for how Pakistani officials can prepare for climate change and promote environmental protection.

“Pakistan should research, innovate, and scale up a range of adaptive climate-change policies and measures,” Qutub tells LobeLog. “These steps could incorporate risk reduction against flooding and other extreme hydro-meteorological events, development of heat-resistant varieties of crops, rotational closure of critical upland watersheds to grazing and wood collection to reduce the risks of landslides, and the prevention of heat stress in urban populations through more appropriate urban design.”

The Pakistani Climate Change Ministry has launched several initiatives to address the dangers of global warming, foremost among them the Clean Green Pakistan Program, but challenges persist.

“Climate change is a reality,” says Salik. “That means adapting to new realities, including on security. Pakistan must identify the communities most affected by climate change and develop national and local adaptation strategies on how to deal with the impacts, relying on international support.”

The resources of the United Nations, the World Bank, and development finance institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and the Islamic Development Bank could help Pakistan brace itself for global warming. Pakistani diplomats could also coordinate their response to climate change with China, Oman, and other neighbors.

“Pakistan should seek cooperative environmental management of the Himalayan region as well as the Arabian Sea and surrounding coastlines with its neighbors,” proposes Qutub.

A Matter of National Security

Pakistan’s influential military may have the greatest stake in preparing the South Asian country for global warming. Pakistani generals could take inspiration from the United States, whose armed forces and intelligence agencies have framed climate change as an obstacle to global security.

“Climate change is now a major security threat to Pakistan,” Salik tells LobeLog. “To ignore non-traditional dimensions of security is, in fact, to make the modern state less secure. It is not just that, every time there is a flood, drought, or other disaster, it distracts the security apparatus from ‘traditional’ duties by turning soldiers into relief officials. It is also that each episode imposes new burdens on law and order and—ultimately—gnaws away at the efficacy of the security apparatus.”

The Pakistani Armed Forces often have to respond to floods and other natural disasters tied to global warming, yet Pakistan’s security policy rarely accounts for environmental degradation.

“Climate change hasn’t been a security concern for Pakistan,” says Pakistani environmentalist and lawyer Ahmad Rafay Alam. “We’re too busy hating on India to notice that troops were mobilized in March to evacuate fifteen hundred families struck by flash flooding and snow in Balochistan.”

Efforts to integrate Pakistan’s environmental and security policies are gaining some momentum. Retired Pakistani lieutenant general Tariq Waseem Ghazi, a former Pakistani Defense Secretary as well as a member of the Global Military Advisory Council on Climate Change, suggested at a November 2017 conference in Brussels that protecting national security needed to include planning for climate change. Even so, Ghazi remains in the minority. As a retiree, he has no effect on Pakistani security policy.

“Environmental security does not figure in Pakistan’s national security policies at present,” Qutub tells LobeLog, noting the consequences of climate change for the South Asian country. “It should.”

Some say it's the best bit of the bird, but would you shell out just for the SKIN of some chicken?

The crispy, crunchy coating is the most poplar part of a KFC treat for many, so fast food chiefs in Indonesia decided to dispense with the rest and just sell fried skin.

Customers can decide to pass on drumsticks, thighs and breast and just go for the spice-coated skin.

There are currently no plans to introduce it in the UK or USA.

The decision to offer skin-only as a gourmet treat was announced by KFC's Indonesia Twitter page, which listed six locations in the country where it could be bought, according to a national newspaper.

However, there's been a mixed response with some customers claiming it was too salty, while others remarked that there wasn't enough seasoning.

One fan praised the skin-only idea.

They said: ""It's different to what you'd expect as it's not the same as normal chicken skin, but the first bite is good. It's really crisp and crunchy! I'll definitely order again as a snack.""

The fast food retailer recently caused a stir when it announced it also considering creating a plant-based fried chicken-style alternative for the menu.","Wed, 05 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article15032258.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_KFC-chicken-shortage.jpg,"['email', 'chicken', 'announced', 'crunchy', 'menu', 'food', 'indonesia', 'fast', 'fried', 'puts', 'kfc', 'skinonly', 'treat', 'skin']", 
70,70,FL-2019-000057-IDN,The economic cost of devastating hurricanes and other extreme weather events is even worse than we thought - The Conversation US,https://theconversation.com/the-economic-cost-of-devastating-hurricanes-and-other-extreme-weather-events-is-even-worse-than-we-thought-108315,"June marks the official start of hurricane season. If recent history is any guide, it will prove to be another destructive year thanks to the worsening impact of climate change.

But beyond more intense hurricanes and explosive wildfires, the warming climate has been blamed for causing a sharp uptick in all types of extreme weather events across the country, such as severe flooding across the U.S. this spring and extensive drought in the Southwest in recent years.

Late last year, the media blared that these and other consequences of climate change could cut U.S. GDP by 10% by the end of the century – “more than double the losses of the Great Depression,” as The New York Times intoned. That figure was drawn from a single figure in the U.S. government’s Fourth National Climate Assessment. (Disclosure: I reviewed that report and was the vice chair on the third one, released in 2014.)

If that sounds scary, I have good news and bad news. The good news is that that figure was drawn incorrectly from a significant misreading of the report - which actually offered a range of a loss of GDP from as low as 6% to as high as 14% by 2090.

The bad news, however, is that a more meaningful assessment of the costs of climate change – using basic economic principles I teach to undergrads – is a hell of a lot scarier.

Reuters/ Drone Base

Tallying the costs

First, let’s look at how government agencies, insurance companies and the media calculate and report on the economic costs of disasters.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in 2018 hurricanes Michael and Florence each caused about US$25 billion in damages, contributing to a total toll of $91 billion from that year’s weather and climate disasters. In 2017, the NOAA’s total was even bigger: $306 billion, due to the massive destruction from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.

But these tallies are not really valid measures of economic damage. Instead, they simply reflect estimates of what people think will need to be invested to rebuild what was damaged or destroyed in the storms, floods or fires.

To really understand the economic costs of an extreme weather event, it’s important to consider all the investment that is being “crowded out” or lost to cover those rebuilding costs. Put another way, there’s only so much money to go around. And that $25 billion being used to rebuild means $25 billion is not being used for other public and private investment opportunities that are more forward-looking or more likely to promote growth.

Accounting for growth

Instead, I believe a fundamentally more sound way to do this is to use something called “growth accounting.”

Growth accounting incorporates the productive use of capital and innovation into the equation. The question we want to ask is what happens to GDP growth when recovery efforts from extreme events crowd out productive investments, like building new factories or roads and bridges?

Returning to NOAA’s estimated losses for 2017 and 2018, productive investment fell about $400 billion in total in those years as a result. That is, had those disasters not happened, investment would have been that much higher. And that diminished investment translates into less growth in gross domestic product – a measure of all an economy produces in a given period.

If similar experiences in extreme events occur for the next 10 years – which is not a bad assumption given that four of the most expensive years in history have occurred in the last five – U.S. GDP in 2029 would be about 3.6% lower than it would have been otherwise, based on my calculations using growth accounting.

That amounts to an economy that’s $1 trillion poorer as result of these extreme weather events crowding out productive investment.

This is the real cost of a world in which these types of massively destructive disasters happen more frequently.

Reuters/Richard Rowe

Sooner and scarier

Returning to our 10% figure, 3.6% is comparatively smaller, of course, but it’s much sooner, which makes it much scarier.

Why?

Because the number of extreme events and their destructive power keeps increasing at an accelerating rate. If we can expect to take a $1 trillion hit over just the next decade, the costs by the end of the century are hardly fathomable.

So while I may disagree with the numbers The New York Times and others use in tallying disasters, they are right to try to spur readers to action.

The situation is just a lot more dire then anyone realizes. With any luck, the size of the figure will frighten us to do more to stave off the worst.","Fri, 31 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/277437/original/file-20190531-69083-5f9o1q.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=7%2C552%2C4839%2C2419&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['weather', 'economic', 'billion', 'extreme', 'devastating', 'events', 'hurricanes', 'productive', 'thought', 'climate', 'cost', 'worse', 'costs', 'investment', 'figure', 'growth']",

They were headed out to conduct land navigation when a troop vehicle carrying 20 cadets, operated by two soldiers, was involved in a roll-over accident, academy officials said in a press release.

One cadet was confirmed deceased after the incident. The two soldiers and 19 cadets received care at Keller Army Community hospital and various other regional medical facilities.

All the injuries were non-life threatening, ranging from scrapes to broken bones, Lt. Col. Christopher Ophardt, a West Point spokesman, told Army Times.

The academy was overwhelmed with phone calls from concerned families of cadets after the incident made the news.

“There are over 2,500 cadets out at the training area right now. There’s no cell phone coverage and they’re not allowed to have their cell phones, so we provided as much information as we could,” Ophardt said. “As of yesterday, at 5 p.m. we notified all the families” of those injured.

“Once that was completed they started rotating through all the 2,500 cadets who are out at the training area to use the cell phones that the trainers had to call their parents, which, you can imagine, took a while,"" he added. “I cannot guarantee that everyone was called last night, but the effort was made to contact their parents from [5 p.m.] through the night.”

The academy has a social media page for families of cadets at https://www.facebook.com/WestPointParents/, and updates about the incident were posted there.

The notification effort was ongoing as of Thursday morning. But the important thing to remember is that every family with an injured cadet has already been contacted, he said.

“The injured actually called their parents themselves,” Ophardt said.

The cadets involved in the accident were from a mix of companies, he added. Their training began after graduation and they still have several weeks to go. There are no expectations of injured students being unable to graduate on time.

“From the range of injuries I saw, they’re all going to be able to graduate,” Ophardt said.

West Point is still waiting to complete the next-of-kin notification process for the deceased cadet before releasing that person’s identity.

The vehicle involved in the accident was an M1085 medium tactical vehicle long wheelbase cargo truck, officials said in the release. It rolled over at approximately 6:45 a.m. Thursday off Route 293 near Camp Natural Bridge in the West Point training area.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the deceased and injured,” Lt. Gen. Darryl Williams, superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy, said at a press conference.

Despite long-standing warnings of a climate emergency as well as efforts by some nations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the worldwide use of fossil fuels — and with it global greenhouse gas emissions — grew last year.

A number of potential disaster scenarios caused by climate change remain well documented. And yet, increasing demand for coal, oil, and natural gas drove the increase in GHG emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.

To determine the countries emitting the most CO2, 24/7 Wall St. ranked countries based on territorial emissions — millions of metric tons of carbon emitted from fossil fuels and cement production within a country’s borders — in 2017 published by the Global Carbon Project 2018. This report and our analysis focuses only on fossil fuel-generated CO2 emissions, the single most important greenhouse gas and by far the largest contributor to anthropogenic warming.

Cement, in particular, and natural resources extraction and processing in general, contribute massively to CO2 emissions. A recent report found that the majority of carbon emissions are created by such processes, even before any fuel is burned.

Resource extraction has more than tripled since 1970 and continues to accelerate, even though the population has only doubled in that time, according to the United Nations’ Global Resources Outlook 2019. Perhaps it is no surprise that the countries emitting the most CO2 are also often among the countries that control the world’s oil.

73,73,FL-2019-000057-IDN,Your bowl of rice is hurting the climate more than you may think - ThePrint,https://theprint.in/science/your-bowl-of-rice-is-hurting-the-climate-more-than-you-may-think/245263/,"London: Eco-conscious consumers are giving up meat and driving electric cars to do their part for the environment, but what about that bowl of rice?

Global rice farming, it turns out, could have the same detrimental effect on global warming in the short term as 1,200 average-sized coal power plants, according to the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund advocacy group. That means the grain is just as damaging over the long term as annual carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels in Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K. combined.

As the sheer size of the staple food’s carbon footprint becomes clearer to scientists, companies including the maker of Uncle Ben’s rice and Olam International Ltd., the world’s second-biggest rice supplier, are starting to source more of the grain from farms that aren’t flooded, a widespread cultivation technique that releases methane gas into the atmosphere.

“The amount of attention that rice receives for these issues is relatively small compared to the size of the problem,” says Paul Nicholson, who heads rice research and sustainability for Olam from Singapore. “People are very informed on their chocolate, coffee, hair care solutions, but rice is an afterthought.”Rice is the staple food of hundreds of millions of Asians and by far the most polluting grain — emitting twice as much of the harmful gases as wheat. Yet it hasn’t been in the spotlight as much as, say, beef, which produces far more emissions per calorie and along with other animal products is the culprit behind almost 60% of greenhouse gas emissions coming from food.

That’s changing as socially conscious consumers, especially in Europe and North America, increasingly demand evidence that the foods they spend their money on are doing the least harm to the environment — and treating farmers and workers in developing countries fairly. With agriculture emitting almost as much greenhouse gas as transportation, those demands will only intensify.

For millennia, rice farmers from Spain to Indonesia have relied on the practice of flooding paddy fields because it stops weeds from growing. But there’s a big drawback: submerging the crop allows tiny underwater microbes to decay organic matter, producing methane, a greenhouse gas that is 25 times more potent than CO2 even though it lingers in the atmosphere for a shorter time. Growing rice in flooded conditions causes up to 12% of global emissions of methane, a gas blamed for about one quarter of global warming caused by humans.

The Sustainable Rice Platform, or SRP, overseen by the United Nations and International Rice Research Institute, is trying to promote change. Earlier this year, the Bangkok-based body released updated guidelines on growing rice more sustainably by, for instance, alternately wetting and drying the crop rather than keeping it flooded, not burning the what’s left of the crop after it has been harvested, using organic fertilizers and promoting fair working conditions.

The SRP is working with thousands of farmers in countries like India, Nigeria, Thailand and Vietnam to give them a score based on these and other factors, with its work funded by corporate members and non-governmental organizations. Rice that complies with the standard will eventually be eligible to carry an “SRP-verified” logo, a certification that will be rolled out later this year—giving consumers a choice for the first time.

Mars Inc., the producer of the Uncle Ben’s brand popular in the U.S. and Europe, shifted to sourcing 87% of its rice under the standard this year, a ratio it expects to boost to 100% by 2020. Olam, too, said it’s pursuing initiatives to get farmers to grow sustainable rice in five Asian and African countries.

“We are working with farmers to develop new methods,” said Louke Koopmans, Mars Food’s global sustainable sourcing manager. As an example, she said the company’s work with 2,500 basmati rice farmers in India and Pakistan has reduced water use by 30%, along with increasing their crop yield and boosting their wages.

“It requires a careful dance of water levels to manage two populations of microbes”

But alternative growing methods carry their own risks.

While farmers can drastically curtail overall emissions if they alternate between wetting and drying, this only works if they flood the crops shallowly. Otherwise as water levels fluctuate, it brings in oxygen which mingles with the nitrogen in the soil and fertilizers to release nitrous oxide, according to K. Kritee, a scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund. Nitrous oxide is 300 times more damaging than CO2 and stays around for more than 100 years longer.

“It requires a careful dance of water levels to manage two populations of microbes,” she said.

To reduce emissions risk from both gases, a study by the EDF in India suggested keeping the water level between 5 centimeters above the surface and 5 cm below. Over a 20-year horizon, total greenhouse gas emissions from rice could take the same toll on the environment as 1,200 coal plants, with the impact dropping to the equivalent of 600 coal plants over 100 years, EDF research shows.

While a lot of farmers in countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos are already being encouraged to grow rice on non-flooded fields, part of the challenge is that farmers need to be trained, for instance, in how to use field water tubes to measure moisture levels. Rolling out such methods in India and China, where rice is a daily staple, will be difficult because of the prevalence of small-scale farms where the grain is produced by families for their own consumption. At the moment, it can take more than 1,400 liters of water to produce one kilogram of rice, according to the International Rice Research Institute.

Olam and SRP aim to train 150,000 farmers by 2023 in Asia and Africa. But even that will barely move the needle, accounting for only 0.1% of the households farming rice globally.

One solution for the environment, according to Kritee, would be for consumers to shift to eating more alternative grains — like maize and wheat — that leaves less of a footprint.

But rice consumption is rising in Europe and the U.S. as more people adopt vegetarian and vegan diets. Even so, the the U.S. makes up less than 1% of total consumption, compared with almost 50% in China and India. To meet growing demand in the next 25 years, rice production must increase by 25%, according to the International Rice Research Institute.

“It’s a dilemma how to deal with this because rice is a staple and of deep cultural value for all in Asia,” Kritee said.- Bloomberg","Tue, 04 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/village.jpg,"['gas', 'hurting', 'staple', 'farmers', 'bowl', 'water', 'emissions', 'climate', 'india', 'growing', 'research', 'according', 'rice', 'think']",

But beyond their stunning natural beauty, these countries are also battling their fair share of economic and environmental issues, many of which are directly related to their status as Small Island Developing States (SIDS).

First recognized by the United Nations in 1992, SIDS are a group of 38 seemingly disparate countries located mostly across the Pacific, the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic, and the Caribbean. Although they are scattered around the world—sometimes thousands of miles apart—these island nations have a lot in common and face many similar challenges.

In particular, most of them have limited economic potential due to their modest size, small population, and lack of natural resources. Remoteness poses a major challenge as well, as many SIDS are located too far from major markets to participate fully in the global economy.

Another common factor is their exposure and vulnerability to natural disasters such as cyclones, floods, storm surges, and landslides, which tend to hit SIDS much more often than other countries. With most of the population and assets concentrated along the coastline at low elevation, any one of those events can quickly threaten human lives and wreak havoc on their economy. When Tropical Cyclone Pam struck the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu in 2015, the resulting damage and losses amounted to more than 64% of the country’s GDP.

Climate change is exacerbating the situation, bringing more frequent and intense weather events, higher temperatures, and rising sea levels—a phenomenon that jeopardizes the very existence of several SIDS.

While climate risk impacts almost all aspects of life in SIDS, transport is disproportionately affected, in part because the infrastructure in many places is located in disaster-prone areas right next to the sea. In the event of a disaster, damage to transport infrastructure can make up a large portion of overall disaster losses, as roads, ports, and runways typically rank among a country’s most valuable assets.

75,75,FL-2019-000057-IDN,Diagnose car problems by odour - Daily Monitor,https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/business/auto/diagnose-car-problems-by-odour-1830456,"One of the smells that are produced in your car is that of a detergent or spray after its body, including the interior, has been washed. This is something not to worry about because you already know where and how it comes about. But when your car produces one of these smells, find out where it is coming from and its cause.

Rubber burning

About a week ago, as he drove to Bushenyi District in western Uganda, Ismail Kakooza, a long distance motorist, noticed that his car reeked of burning rubber. He ignored the smell, believing it would subside. However, when he reached Mpigi, it was worse and when he reached Masaks, he decided to take that car to a garage.

“When the mechanic checked the car, he discovered that the rear brakes were too tight. He said the smell was as a result of the heat that brake pads produced after rubbing against the brake drum. The brakes were slightly loosened to function normally,” Kakooza recalls, adding that the brake strain also produced a lot of heat that the mechanic observed would have led to brake system rubbers bursting, which would eventually have led to brake failure.

Stephen Jjuuko, a mechanic in Wandegeya, Kampala, says the other cause of this smell is old or worn out tyres. The smell becomes sharp and irritating, especially when your tyres do not have treads.

“When you brake instantly and the tyres leave tyre marks on the road surface, you will also smell a burning rubber scent. It will exist for some time but will eventually disappear,” Jjuuko explains, warning that instant braking also sometimes leads to unexpected tyre bursts that might cause a car to overturn, leading to injury and loss of lives.

Another burning rubber-like smell that could be produced from your car are from the brakes. If this is so, it means that your brake pads are old and need to be replaced immediately.

Fuel smell

In Kakooza’s case, he was lucky that he noticed that there was a rubber burning smell and endeavoured to have it sorted.

Unfortunately, there are some motorists who smell unusual scents from their cars and choose to just drive on and ignore the smell. One of the commonest smells is that of car fuel.

Innocent Karugaba was on his way to Mubende when his car started reeking of fuel.

“When I walked around the car, I found that there was a fuel leakage from the fuel tank that was spilling on one of the rear tyres. The pump attendant had over filled the tank. Some of the fuel had overflowed yet the rubber on the fuel tank lead could release some of the fuel as I drove up the hill,” Karugaba recalls.

Raymond Timothy Komakech, a motorist, observes that if you smell fuel from your car as you drive, there is a possibility that your mechanic could have used a very small portion of fuel to clean one of your car parts. Komakech also notes that fuel smell could be a possibility of a fuel leakage from the bottom of your car.

“If you park your car and a brownish layer forms on the ground, this means fuel is leaking from the engine, especially as it transfers from the tank to the engine burning chamber via the injector pump,” Komakech explains.

AC smell

When you turn on your car air conditioner (AC) regardless of whether you need hot or cold air and you smell dust, it is a sign that your air conditioning system, especially the air cleaner has been clogged with dust.

This happens when you have taken some time without using the air conditioner.

“When the air conditioner is turned on, to receive cold or hot air, the system will blow the dust in the air cleaner inwards before you start receiving the needed air. The smell will cover the car interior for about two minutes and will clear as you drive on,” Jjuuko says.

Rotten egg smell

According to firestone complete auto care, an online portal, a rotten egg smell in your car often indicates a malfunctioning part in the fuel system.

The portal explains that if the catalytic converter, fuel filters or fuel pressure sensors are worn out or damaged, a sulfur gas can leak out and make its way into your car’s cabin.

“This smell is not just unpleasant; it can be dangerous. Sometimes, the issue is as simple as replacing transmission fluid as old fluid can produce that same rotten egg smell in cars,” the portal advises.

Others

Maple syrup

If your engine has been running for a few minutes and you start to smell something sweet, coolant containing ethylene glycol could be leaking from the radiator, cylinder head or a failed intake manifold gasket. If the smell is strongest inside the car, this is could indicate a problem with the heater core. In both cases, you will need to have a mechanic look into the issue.

Burnt paper

The smell of burnt paper while driving, especially when changing gears, might be a sign that the clutch facing is burning off as the clutch slips. This can happen if the driver is “riding” the clutch, stepping too frequently on the pedal, which causes significant friction. This friction creates enough heat to actually burn the paper-based clutch facings, which can cause the whole clutch to fail.","Wed, 05 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.monitor.co.ug/resource/blob/1830458/761a3af568c2fdd0dc5bba0c584e68f3/auto3-pic-data.jpg,"['brake', 'burning', 'problems', 'fuel', 'clutch', 'smell', 'odour', 'air', 'car', 'mechanic', 'tyres', 'tank', 'diagnose']",

The Helsinki Committee, a human rights NGO, said it had received numerous reports of racist insults from fans after their Vardar club took home the trophy in Cologne on Sunday

SKOPJE (REPUBLIC OF NORTH MACEDONIA) - North Macedonia handball fans were rebuked Monday for chanting anti-Albanian ""hate speech"" during celebrations after a Skopje club was crowned European Champions over the weekend.

The Helsinki Committee, a human rights NGO, said it had received numerous reports of racist insults from fans after their Vardar club took home the trophy in Cologne on Sunday.

Most of the abuse was directed at ethnic Albanians, who make up a quarter of the Balkan state's mainly Slav population, it said. The mainly Muslim minority is a frequent target of nationalists and has long complained of discrimination.

Some fans chanted ""Gas chamber"" and called for a ""pure Macedonia"", the NGO said.

Later on Monday, tens of thousands of people turned out to welcome the team's double-decker bus as it drove from the airport to Skopje's main square, in one of the biggest public gatherings in recent years for the small country of 2.1 million.

Fans lit flares and waved the country's flag and other nationalist symbols as the bus entered Skopje's centre and the players took to a stage.

At least one group of around 50 fans at the airport were heard chanting ""A dead Albanian is a good Albanian"".

The interior ministry had earlier urged citizens ""not to use insulting slogans or chants, or sing songs that spread hate speech"" at the event.

Clips on social media from Sunday showed fans singing: ""Let them know, the evil 'shiptars' (a deragatory term for Albanians), that the name Macedonia will never die.""

Those lyrics were a reference to the recent government move adding ""North"" to the country's name -- a change that ended a long-running dispute with neighbouring Greece but enraged nationalists at home.

The change was spearheaded by the Social Democrat-led government which, with support from minority Albanian parties, ousted a nationalist administration in 2017.

After clinching the handball trophy in Cologne, Germany, on Sunday, the club's captain Stojance Stoilov interrupted an interviewer to say: ""I just want to make a correction. My country's name is the Republic of Macedonia.""

The comment was applauded by nationalists, particularly on social media.

On Monday evening, Stoilov and the crowd also chanted: ""Never North, only Macedonia"".

The victory for Vardar earned the multi-sport club founded in 1961 its second handball European Champions trophy.","Tue, 04 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20190604/c1_3214508_700.jpg,"['speech', 'rebuked', 'club', 'n', 'vardar', 'social', 'fans', 'hate', 'macedonia', 'took', 'north', 'trophy', 'handball', 'ngo']",

South Atlantic news service MercoPress, reports that deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest has reached its fastest rate in a decade (also since the current recording system’s records began), according to data collected by a Brazilian satellite early-warning system. This Reuters story points the finger at illegal loggers encouraged by the easing of environmental protections under new Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. The Guardian notes that despite this, fines given by the government’s monitoring agency has issued the least number of penalties in 11 years, and that inspection operations are down by 70 percent on last year. Since Bolsonaro was sworn into office in January, he has been criticised by environment agencies for encouraging the expansion of agriculture and mining interests, whilst weakening indigenous land rights and his own environment ministry. The Guardian article goes on to claim that Brazil’s environment minister has made moves to privatise the satellite monitoring of the forest, responsible for unearthing these new figures; whilst Reuters reports that Brazilian environmental protection agency IBAMA, has launched its biggest-ever operation against illegal logging, backed by police and the military.

Professor Matthew Kirwan of William & Mary’s Virginia Institute of Marine Science, who recently published a review of these so-called “ghost forests”, describes them as “the best indicator of climate change on the East Coast”. Part of the challenge of climate change along the Atlantic coast is managing the landscape transition from economically important timber forests to ecologically important coastal wetlands, and in another piece on Phys.org Kirwan calls for policy-makers to ensure that landowners are rewarded for maximising the public benefit of the changing landscape.

Though a joint investigation by several Indian agencies has not found any suspicious objects on a Kuwait-bound Indonesian ship and a towing vessel that were intercepted off the coast of Mul Dwarka in Gujarat on Saturday, the Indian Coast Guard has said that further investigations are underway as the ship did not inform them about the sinking of another vessel that it was initially carrying.

The ship — ‘Tug Nadia Adib’ — which had left Indonesia on April 27 for Kuwait was initially carrying two OSVs — Esnaad 711 and Esnaad 712. However, Esnaad 711 sank off Diu reportedly due to flooding which was not disclosed by the ship to any of the Indian authorities, defence sources said.

The Coast Guard district headquarters at Porbandar on Thursday received information about satellite transmission emitted from an unknown vessel off the Diu coast, following which it was intercepted. It was identified as Esnaad 712.

The ship and its vessel were intercepted by the Coast Guard on Saturday morning, around 9.30 am, near Okha Marine Coast Guard police station off Mul Dwarka coast. A dozen persons, including seven Iranian and five Indian nationals, were also detained from the ship and the vessel.

“During the initial radio interrogation of the vessel by the Coast Guard, it was suspected to be concealing facts, and falsely reporting the movement to VTMS (vessel traffic management system) Khambhat for emergency anchoring off Diu coast, due to shortage of fuel and water. Thereafter, both the vessels were brought to Mul Dwarka harbour for joint rummaging and investigation by the India Coast Guard, Marine Police, Customs and Anti-Terrorist Squad of Gujarat Police,” said the defence spokesperson.

“DG Shipping is being laised for verifying the facts of the vessels,” the defence spokesperson added.

The Coast Guard has invited multiple agencies including Customs and Narcotics Control Bureau for a combined search to look for contraband and further interrogate the detainees. However, officials have confirmed that till now, they have not found any narcotics or contraband item on the ship as well as vessel.

“All the investigating agencies have confirmed that the vessel is not engaged in any suspicious activity,” the Coast Guard said in a release.

Meanwhile, an official of Narcotics Control Bureau, Ahmedabad zone, also said that no contraband was found from the ship and the vessel till now. “We were informed by the Coast Guard that ship and vessel have been intercepted off the Dwarka coast and we sent a team to search the vessels. However, our team has not found any narcotic item yet,” said the official.

In our view, there are still major problems with the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. These must be addressed to make sure the system is resilient enough to have a reasonable chance of bouncing back from future shocks to the river’s ecosystems, particularly due to climate change.

Read more: Damning royal commission report leaves no doubt that we all lose if the Murray-Darling Basin Plan fails

Here are five ways the government can clean up the Murray-Darling Basin Plan so the river system has a chance of surviving in the long term.

1. Allow the rivers to spill into the floodplain

There are restrictions in all states on deliberately using environmental water (water set aside to keep the rivers healthy) to go over the river bank and inundate the floodplain. When this happens, it’s known as “overbank flow”, and is restricted to areas and times of year when it’s permitted.

Overbank flow is the connection between rivers and their floodplain, and is essential for two reasons.

Shutterstock

The first is to ensure floodplain wetlands and forests are resilient. For example, without additional water, the current red gum forests along the River Murray are likely to die and be replaced with black box trees, which need less water.

The second is for the exchange of nutrients and organic matter between rivers and floodplains. Without these inputs from the floodplain, the river system would only be able to support a much smaller number of fish.

Governments have been reluctant to work towards increased overbank flows, largely because of a potential backlash from landholders who don’t want their floodplain land to be flooded.

Read more: Aboriginal voices are missing from the Murray-Darling Basin crisis

But in several regions, such as the Edward-Wakool system in New South Wales, landowners and government officials are working through the issues that infrequent flooding has on riverside agricultural land, such as stock being unable to graze flooded areas, crops being innundated by floodwaters, and loss of access to parts of their property through road flooding.

We hope their discussions will lead to a balance, where overbank flows can still occur with minimum impact on landholders.

Still, without changes to state policies on overbank flows, parts of the Basin’s floodplain systems are unlikely to have sufficient resilience to absorb future stresses.

2. Better management of the rivers

The Commonwealth and states now have almost 3 trillion litres (3,000 gigalitres) of dedicated environmental water, purchased from irrigators, many of whom have made significant water savings by upgrading their irrigation equipment.

This is called “held” environmental water. Currently, there is around 3 trillion litres of held environmental water, and 13.7 trillion litres of water allocated to irrigators in the Murray-Darling Basin.

Dean Lewins/AAP Image

Management of this environmental water is relatively new, compared with the management of water for irrigators, which has been occurring for the better part of 80 years in rivers such as the Murray, Goulburn and Murrumbidgee.

There is a major difference in when environmental and irrigation water is needed through the year. Farmers have their highest water demand for irrigation in late spring and summer, while the major environmental water demand is often highest in late winter and early spring. This is when high natural inflows would have filled river channels and spilled into floodplain forests and wetlands.

The use of the river channels to deliver irrigation water has lead to large flows in the summer when naturally the river flows would have been low. This has resulted in environmental problems, such as bank erosion and the wrong triggers for fish breeding.

3. A greater focus on river refuges

During periods of low or no flow, many of the Basin’s rivers exist as networks of waterholes. In such dry periods, these waterholes are vital habitats, or “refuges”, for fish, frogs, waterbugs, and other species that need permanent water.

Changes in land use, flow regimes and the condition of riverbank vegetation all threaten the ability for these waterholes to act as refuges for these species. These waterhole refuges also need a full set of structural habitats, such as snags and riverbank vegetation.

Read more: A good plan to help Darling River fish recover exists, so let's get on with it

Maintaining a “mosaic” of refuges with different levels of connection is required for the full suite of species to be able to survive droughts.

4. Better protection of planned environmental water

Runoff – rainwater that drains from the land and into the rivers – will be seriously affected by climate change.

A predicted 20% reduction in rainfall is expected in the southern Basin by 2050. This would translate to a 40-50% reduction in runoff, and would impact on all water in the Murray-Darling Basin.

Disturbingly, the current policy in the Basin Plan safeguards the entitlements to irrigation water and held environmental water, but not the rest of the flow – which is largely also “environmental” water. Currently, this makes up around half of the total flow (32.5 trillion litres per year) in the Murray-Darling Basin a very large volume.

Shutterstock

The effect varies over the basin, but by 2030, overall losses are predicted to be two to three times greater for water that is outside of these entitlements, compared with irrigation water and held environmental water.

Unless this policy is changed, climate change will have an excessive impact on the river’s health. Entitlement-holders will continue to take the same amount of water while the overall river flow drops dramatically. This deficiency must be addressed when the Basin Plan is reviewed by 2026.

5. Linking water and other natural resource management

The Basin’s water resources do not exist in isolation from other “natural capital”, such as riverbank habitats, floodplain land, and the surrounding catchments.

Before the Basin Plan, the Murray-Darling Basin Commission had in place an integrated natural resource management strategy, but this has now been discontinued.

River scientists know “the catchment rules the river”. But the water and catchments are now managed separately, despite many calls over the years for better integration.

Poor agricultural practices result in sediment, nutrients and salt entering the rivers in runoff. This reduces water quality and harms the Basin’s ability to provide essential “ecosystem services”, such as water quality improvement and the effective functioning of the ecosystem.

We believe a more coordinated management of all natural resources in the Basin, and attention to other complementary measures, should be addressed when the current Basin Plan is reviewed in 2026.

We submit that continuing with the existing Basin Plan, it’s unlikely the Murray-Darling Basin will be resilient enough to withstand future climate impacts, and we will see major detrimental changes to the basin’s ecosystems.

At the very least, we must properly implement the current Basin Plan by addressing the first three issues above, and also make the necessary policy change to ensure the other two issues – protection of planned environmental water and better links with other natural resources – are addressed in the next Basin Plan in 2026.","Mon, 10 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/278017/original/file-20190605-40715-16218mc.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C841%2C5526%2C2758&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['basin', 'ways', 'river', 'water', 'floodplain', 'natural', 'clean', 'rivers', 'flow', 'plan', 'murraydarling', 'environmental']", 
84,84,FL-2019-000057-IDN,Restoration of Ansupa Lake brightens wetland conservation hopes - Mongabay-India,https://india.mongabay.com/2019/06/restoration-of-ansupa-lake-brightens-wetland-conservation-hopes/,"Ansupa Lake was a wasteland three years ago and of no use to the fishing community living in the vicinity.

The oxbow lake formed by the Mahanadi was covered in over 20 types of freshwater weeds, which proved detrimental to the ecosystem.

The Chilika Development Authority, which took charge of developing the lake, formed The Ansupa Integrated Self Help Group, which manages lake activities.

With the help of a mechanical weed harvester, the lake is now cleared. Fishing is regulated and income from tourism goes back to the community.

Women in villages surrounding Ansupa, Odisha’s largest natural freshwater lake, are a happier lot since the work on the restoration of the wetland ecosystem began. It’s almost as if their lifeline has been restored.

According to Subarni Dalei, 45, of Subarnapur village, “The restoration of the lake has not only increased the space for fishing activities for the locals, but also opened up many other livelihood opportunities for us.”

A member of one of the four self-help groups (SHGs) under the ambit of Ansupa integrated SHG, Subarni is involved in the management of various services provided at the eco garden developed by the Chilika Development Authority (CDA), which now looks after the restoration and conservation of the wetland ecosystem. The integrated SHG, a CDA initiative, now manages the fishing activities in the lake, as also boating and other recreational facilities at the eco garden.

People, particularly the fisherfolk living around Ansupa Lake, have seen remarkable changes since the restoration of the dying water body and conservation of the wetland ecosystem began. “Three years back it was almost of no use to the local communities as there was hardly any space for fishing and allied activities because of weeds,” Debaraj Rout, 51, of nearby Ratagarh village said.

A dying wetland

Around 50 kilometres away from the twin cities of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar, Ansupa is an oxbow lake that was isolated during the lateral shift of Odisha’s largest river, Mahanadi, which flows nearly 2-km away from the lake now. This water body in fact looks like a horseshoe.

“Water bodies that get isolated from rivers supporting them normally dry up and die. But fortunately, Ansupa survived and a freshwater ecosystem came up in and around the wetland,” said Susanta Nanda, Chief Executive of CDA, who guides and oversees the restoration and conservation works at Ansupa.

Spread over an area over 700 acres and host to a variety of aquatic plants and fishes, the lake was the major source of livelihood for the surrounding villages, said Debaraj Rout, recalling his association with the lake during his school days over 35 years ago.

Large amounts of silt — about 100,000 metric tonnes a year — comprising clay and sand and heavily loaded with nitrogen and phosphate that flow in from paddy fields get deposited in the lake during rainy seasons. Its nutritious nature was an invitation for weeds and soon the lake saw proliferation of freshwater weeds of 21 varieties of submerged, emergent and floating categories, resulting in high eutrophic condition and hypoxia, according to a study.

Because of heavy siltation, the area comprising water in the lake diminished to almost half its normal size. According to Sumati Behura, 61, of Subarnapur, “As the area occupied by weeds inside the lake expanded, the space for clean water shrank drastically. It was insufficient for fishing or bathing. Even country boats found it impossible to wade through it.”

The dense weed cover blocked sunlight, leading to degradation of the quality of the water on account of the low level of dissolved oxygen in it. The result was hypoxia setting in, and survival and growth of aquatic life becoming difficult. According to Fani Bhushan Nanda, assistant conservator of forest (ACF) at CDA, “It hampered the growth of phytoplankton as well as fish.”

Soon the catch (of fish) decreased to less than one fifth (20 percent) of the normal, according to local fisherman Anama Chandra Dalai (50).

Even as the diminishing growth of fish began affecting the livelihood of the local fishing communities directly, migratory as well as resident birds started abandoning the wetland as it couldn’t offer these birds sufficient food like phytoplankton and fishes. “In its cyclic impact, the wetland ecosystem faced severe degradation and the survival of the lake was threatened,” Nanda, ACF, said.

The weed-free water area shrank to about 20 acres and was scattered across the nearly 400 acres of total water area, the data provided by the CDA for the year 2017 show.

Reversing the trend

Even though the water body came under the control of the CDA during 2008-09, the restoration works involving manual de-weeding began only in 2016. Weeds are a part of this wetland ecosystem, and de-weeding is a normal natural process that occurs regularly during the inflow and outflow of water in times of floods. However, with floods becoming a rare occurrence because of the decrease in water in the Mahanadi River, this natural process got disrupted, according to Binod Acharya, ACF at the CDA, who is also involved in Ansupa restoration works.

Mahanadi River is now severely water stressed primarily owing to construction of dams and barrages upstream for irrigation and industrial purposes, as well as due to temperature soaring. As warned by the State of India’s Rivers (2016), disproportionate use of Mahanadi river water by the residents and industrial units in the Mahanadi Basin would be a matter of serious concern in the near future.

With the possibility of natural de-weeding diminishing, the CDA initiated a manual de-weeding program in 2016. But this wasn’t highly successful in restoring the lake, and in December 2018, the CDA with the support of Integrated Coastal Zone Management Programme (ICZMP) engaged a mechanical weed harvester for de-weeding the Ansupa Lake.

It’s only six months now, but the progress has been remarkable.

According to CDA data, the water body is now recovering rapidly, with nearly 295 acres of the 490-acre water-spread area becoming weed free. The water spread area of the lake went up from 400 acres in 2017 to 490 in 2019 thanks to extensive restoration.

“Last winter, the lake had over 60 bird species including 30 migratory species visiting it. Resident birds which had abandoned the wetland are now returning to Ansupa,” ornithologist Tuhinansu Kar said.

Fishing is also slowly becoming a reliable source of livelihood for the local communities. “The average daily catch of a fisherman is now around 5 kg. Catching even one kg of fish was almost impossible before the de-weeding works had started,” said Bikram Jena, 54, a fisherman of Malbiharpur who depends on fishing in the lake to feed his seven-member family.

Making community a partner

In order to engage the local community, which is the primary beneficiary of the ecosystem, in protection and conservation works, the CDA formed the Ansupa Integrated Self Help Group accommodating four local SHGs in it. The integrated SHG is now managing all activities in the lake as well as services related to wetland dependent tourism.

“We regulate fishing activities in the lake by giving it on lease to the Ansupa Matsyajivee Society, an organization of fishermen in the locality. We also manage the tourism activities at the eco-garden complex developed by the CDA and maintain the complex,” said Shobha Dalei, 45, a member of the integrated SHG.

A third of the income generated goes to the community members engaged in various activities, and a part of it goes to the CDA that looks after restoration and conservational activities. The rest is kept as corpus fund, said Debaraj Rout, who works as a supervisor at the eco-garden.

It’s not just the SHG members and youth recruited by the CDA who are engaged in conservation and maintenance of the ecosystem. All those who depend on the wetland for their livelihood are also involved, Rout added.

Ideas for sustainability

The major challenge before the CDA after de-weeding the lake would be to make it a sustainable habitat for its life systems to thrive and thus an assured means of livelihood for the local communities.

Since the flow of water from Mahanadi is projected to deplete further in the wake of rising temperature and climate change, and developmental needs of the riparian states, “our primary task was to conserve rainwater flushed by nearby Sarandagada and Bishnupur hills at the surface as well as in the subsurface soil, and recharge groundwater sources,” said CDA Chief Executive Susanta Nanda.

“While the traditional water channels for inflow and outflow of water are being restored, staggered trenches are also being dug around to filter out the eroded soil from the water. These trenches hold water for longer time and facilitate percolation of water on to the surface of the soil, supporting the lake’s ecosystem throughout the year and helping agriculture in the 3000-hectare catchments during the dry seasons,” he added.

During de-weeding, weeds in some parts of the lake were left intact to make the wetland a healthy habitat for resident as well as migratory birds. To augment the food supply for the birds and to enhance livelihood opportunities for the local communities, the CDA has been releasing into the lake fingerlings of freshwater fishes, including the carp species that are popular locally.

“One of the major challenges here is to maintain the quality of water by reducing the nutrient inflow to keep weeds in control, help growth of fishes and sustain aquatic lives. For this, we have been requesting local farmers to take to organic farming and avoid using chemical fertilisers,” said Nanda. “Things are moving in a positive direction. And to stop encroachment we are talking to the district administration as it is a revenue related matter,” he added.

Across the globe people are worried about the future of wetland ecosystems. Ramsar Convention’s Global Wetland Outlook reveals that wetlands are disappearing three times faster than forests, and that between 1970 and 2015, the earth lost nearly 35 percent of its wetlands.

In such a grim scenario, the Ansupa Lake returning to life and the health of its ecosystem improving mean a lot to the global community deeply worried about the future of wetlands. “It’s not only an encouragement for us, it also bears hope about conservation of degraded wetlands,” said Nanda.

It’s the latest problem Boein...

(CNN) — Boeing on Sunday said some of its 737 planes, including many 737 Max aircraft, may have faulty parts on their wings. It’s the latest problem Boeing faces as it tries to get its most important and popular airplane, the grounded 737 Max, back in the air.

Working with the Federal Aviation Administration, Boeing said it has reached out to airlines that fly 737 planes, advising them to inspect their slat track assemblies on Max and NG aircraft. The 737 NG series includes the 737-600, -700, -800 and -900 planes.

Leading edge slats are an aerodynamic control surface that extend from the front of the wing. Some the tracks may not meet manufacturing standards and may need to be replaced, Boeing and the FAA said. They said if the parts are found to be defective, airlines should replace them before returning the planes to service.

The faulty parts could fail prematurely or crack. The FAA said a part failure would not bring down a plane, but it could damage an aircraft while in flight.

Boeing has sent out a service bulletin and the FAA will issue an airworthiness directive requiring airlines to inspect and repair its slat track assemblies within 10 days.

The company discovered the problem Friday, when Boeing was meeting with the parts supplier. Boeing employees noticed some of the parts were not heat treated, which led them to believe there might be a safety issue.

The development comes as Boeing seeks to get the 737 Max back in the air. The plane was grounded worldwide after a fatal crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet in March, which followed a fatal crash of a Lion Air jet in Indonesia in October. Crash investigators have focused on an automatic safety feature on the jet as a possible contributor to the crashes.

The newly discovered issue affects 148 slat tracks produced by a single supplier, Boeing said. The company said it believes 20 737 Max and 21 737 NG planes may have defective slat tracks. But the FAA advised airlines to check an additional 179 Max planes and 133 NGs to determine if their parts are also faulty. Of the group that needs to be inspected, 33 Max and 32 NG planes are in the United States.

The company and the FAA said it has not been notified of any incidents related to the tracks on operating flights, and the fix should take a couple days to complete.

“We are committed to supporting our customers in every way possible as they identify and replace these potentially non-conforming tracks,” said Kevin McAllister, CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, in a statement.

The announcement comes after the International Air Transport Association, a global trade group representing 290 airlines, released a forecast Sunday stating that the airline industry is on track to have its worst year since 2014. Though not mentioned directly, the grounding of the 737 MAX was expected to be a factor.","Mon, 03 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/KFSM/images/b1012b26-abf9-4e39-a190-2878d5ba3b8c/b1012b26-abf9-4e39-a190-2878d5ba3b8c_1140x641.jpg,"['planes', 'tracks', 'faa', 'boeings', 'slat', 'faulty', '737', 'parts', 'defective', 'details', 'max', 'boeing', 'airlines', 'announcement']",

The Canadian Coast Guard has officially welcomed CCGS Captain Molly Kool to its fleet with the traditional breaking of a ceremonial bottle upon the ship’s bow on May 30.

The vessel is the first of three new icebreakers to join the Coast Guard fleet and the first in 25 years.

The CCGS Captain Molly Kool is classed as a medium icebreaker, which can maintain a speed of three knots through ice up to one meter thick. The vessel has a total of 18,278 horsepower and its twin propellers and twin rudders provide a high degree of maneuverability. The CCGS Captain Molly Kool can operate continuously without refueling for approximately 25 days and has a crew of 19.

The CCGS Captain Molly Kool bears the name of the first woman in North America to be certified of Master of a Cargo Steamship in the Home Trade. This was one of the highest levels of qualification that could be achieved in the seagoing profession when Kool attained the designation in 1939. She was a pioneer who stepped outside the constraints of traditional gender roles and broke down barriers helping female mariners move out of the periphery and into the mainstream.

This new vessel, like all icebreakers, will provide essential icebreaking services to ensure safe navigation, prevent ice jams and flooding, and maintain shipping routes. From December to May, icebreakers operate in Atlantic Canada, the St. Lawrence River, and the Great Lakes, and in the Arctic from May to November. They are equipped to respond to search and rescue calls and to provide aids to navigation and environmental responses.

In August 2018, Chantier Davie of Lévis, Quebec was awarded a $610 million dollar contract for the acquisition of three interim icebreakers for the Coast Guard. The three icebreakers were acquired to supplement the Coast Guard’s existing fleet during vessel life extension and repair periods, providing continuous on-water capability during scheduled maintenance periods.

CCGS Captain Molly Kool was accepted into the Coast Guard fleet in December 2018. The second and third vessels will be accepted into service in late 2019 and summer 2020, respectively.","Fri, 31 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Navy_Govt_CoastGuard/captain-molly-kool-canadian-coast-guard.2a918a.jpg,"['molly', 'icebreakers', 'provide', 'ccgs', 'watch', 'kool', 'fleet', 'guard', 'coast', 'welcomed', 'captain', 'vessel']", 
87,87,FL-2019-000057-IDN,Congress sends Trump disaster bill with aid to storm-struck military posts - DefenseNews.com,https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/06/04/congress-sends-trump-disaster-bill-with-aid-to-storm-struck-military-posts/,"WASHINGTON ― Congress has approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid deal that contains nearly $3 billion for storm-stricken military facilities around the country after the House passed it Monday, 354-58.

President Donald Trump is expected to sign the package, sending aid to victims of Western wildfires, Midwestern flooding and hurricanes that hit the South and Puerto Rico ― as well as Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida; Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska; and Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, both in North Carolina.

The bill allotted the Air Force a total of $1.67 billion, the Navy and Marine Corps $981 million, the Coast Guard $477 million, the Army National Guard $42 million, and the Department of Veterans Affairs $3 million. Appropriators offered a mix of military construction and operations and maintenance funding, some with the flexibility to be spent over several years.

The bipartisan House vote saw 132 Republicans vote with the Democratic majority. All 58 “no” votes were Republicans.

Storm-ravaged bases wait on Washington for repair money Hundreds of millions of repair dollars are at stake for several stateside military bases.

Monday’s vote came after three Republican congressmen blocked passage of the bill during a pro forma session on Thursday. One of the objections came from Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, who cited its omission of $4.5 billion for urgent border needs and his concern over the national debt.

House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., rebuked those lawmakers in a floor statement ahead of Monday’s vote, saying: “Today we are rejecting the political stunts and grandstanding that have made it difficult to deliver much-needed disaster relief to families and communities across America.”

I’m glad the disaster relief bill has finally passed the House. Florida’s Panhandle and Puerto Rico so desperately need to recover following Hurricane Michael & Maria. It’s long overdue.

The committee’s top Republican, Rep. Kay Granger, of Texas, said the bill’s critical funding for military installations severely damaged by hurricanes and floods “will return these facilities to a condition that can can support our men and women in uniform and help them get back to the job of protecting our nation.”

The delay had caused a domino effect for military construction projects outside the three devastated communities stateside. As funding ran out for recovery efforts in May, the Air Force halted and moved funding from 61 critical infrastructure projects across 18 states and five overseas locations, while the Marine Corps did likewise.

On May 23, the GOP-controlled Senate had passed the bill on a bipartisan basis, 85-8, hours after the White House backed off a rigid stance, insisting the bill include $4.5 billion for Department of Homeland Security operations at the border. The vote capped months of negotiations, in which the White House called out what it saw as excessive funding for Puerto Rico.

The Air Force is spinning toward a $4 billion financial disaster On May 1, Tyndall Air Force Base will be unable to pay for any new hurricane relief projects at the base. That's just the start.

Democratic leaders had faulted the president and Republicans overall for the delays on disaster aid, which is typically a bipartisan issue in Congress.

Republican Rep. Don Bacon, who represents a community near Offutt and once served in the Air Force as a wing commander, criticized the Republicans who blocked the bill, telling the Omaha World-Herald they were “giving our own party a bad name.”","Mon, 03 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/BJV7FDz6ftihXUjk9eyG3N_mzEk=/1200x630/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-mco.s3.amazonaws.com/public/56KR4P7IFZAENKO2TPZHPBXIAU.JPG,"['bill', 'trump', 'billion', 'force', 'sends', 'air', 'posts', 'disaster', 'vote', 'military', 'house', 'stormstruck', 'aid', 'funding', 'congress', 'million']",

Improvements, but Wrongdoing Goes On

The government lived up to its promises to pass new laws and rules that cover everything from how thorough inspections need to be, to the maximum age of ferries, to the training of crews to better deal with emergencies on the high seas.

The penalties for lawbreakers have been stiffened, and prosecutors have cracked down hard when violators are caught.

What has proved much harder to fix is the pursuit of profit at all cost and an often casual disregard for safety — problems that have long been blamed in South Korea not only for shipping disasters but also for building collapses and hospital fires.

Maritime investigators continue to find pervasive wrongdoing, especially by the employees of cargo-handling companies and by truck drivers who lie about the weight of their cargo .

“We have made a lot of changes and improvement since the Sewol incident,” said Park Han-seon, who coordinates research on maritime safety at the Korea Maritime Institute. “But what the country still needs is a safety culture where business managers put safety before profit.”

And while the government has taken aim at business practices, victims’ families have accused it of failing to set its sights on officials’ own culpability in the ferry disaster. The families are angry that senior government officials did not end up in jail, especially for the botched rescue effort.

The Coast Guard was both late to the scene and woefully unprepared to help when it finally got there.

In April, the families called on the authorities to investigate former top officials, accusing them of failing to order an evacuation of the passengers in the early hours of the disaster and over accusations that they conspired to impede investigations.

“We know who killed our children, but we are not able to punish them,” said Jang Hoon, who lost his 17-year-old son.

MANILA - A Dutch birdwatcher held by Islamic State-linked militants was killed Friday during a firefight between his kidnappers and soldiers in the southern Philippines, according to the military, which said he was shot by his captors as he tried to escape.

Ewold Horn had been held since 2012 by the Abu Sayyaf kidnap-for-ransom group and was fatally wounded as soldiers fought a 90-minute gun battle with the jihadists on their stronghold, Jolo island.

""Horn was shot by one of his guards when he tried to escape from the Abu Sayyaf during this morning's gunfight,"" said Brigadier General Divino Rey Pabayo in a statement.

The military's account could not be independently confirmed.

The southern Philippines is home to numerous armed groups, several of which are linked to the decades-old insurgency aiming to create a Muslim homeland in the Christian majority nation's deep south.

""I am shocked by this tragic outcome,"" Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok told news agency ANP.

""I'm in touch with the family. I will ask my Philippine colleague for further clarification"" on the circumstance of Ewold's death, Blok added.

Horn was on an expedition to photograph rare birds on the remote Tawi-Tawi island group in the southern Philippines when he was abducted by unknown gunmen and turned over to the Abu Sayyaf.

Horn was seized along with Lorenzo Vinciguerra, a Swiss national who managed to escape in 2014 during a gunbattle between soldiers and his captors.

Abu Sayyaf has been blamed for some of the worst terror attacks in Philippine history, including repeated kidnappings of foreigners who are usually ransomed off for huge amounts.

Philippine officials assert the group was behind the deadly January bombing of a Cathedral on Jolo island during Sunday mass that was the worst attack to hit the nation in years.

The bombing was claimed by the Islamic State, which has worked to maintain a presence in the Philippines as its caliphate crumbled in the Middle East.

Abu Sayyaf was active in the Philippines years before linking up with Islamic State, and has supported its violent activities with kidnapping.

The group has held hostages over the course of years as it negotiated ransoms, but has shown a willingness to kill its captives.

Abu Sayyaf beheaded German hostage Jurgen Kantner, 70, in 2017 after its demands for a roughly $600,000 ransom were not met.

Two Canadian hostages kidnapped from yachts moored at a marina on a tourist island in the southern Philippines were also beheaded in 2016 after demands for ransoms of similar amounts went unfulfilled.

The military said Friday that the group was believed to hold at least two Filipinos and a Vietnamese national, but it could not be sure they were still alive.","Fri, 31 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20190531/c1_3211256_700.jpg,"['rebels', 'islamic', 'army', 'island', 'group', 'islinked', 'worst', 'killed', 'soldiers', 'sayyaf', 'philippines', 'dutchman', 'abu', 'held', 'southern']",

He has launched an ambitious reform plan in strategic state-dominated sectors including telecommunications, energy, the financial sector, and shipping and logistics. Pushing forward with these important reforms, along with ending the two-tier foreign exchange system, will be critical for the country’s growth, opening the door to more private sector investment, better services, and fiscal sustainability.

To support these major reforms, the World Bank Group helped with Ethiopia’s government to set up Africa’s biggest urban safety net program. This program provides cash grants to the most vulnerable, builds community leaders, and gives cash for work opportunities – such as protecting the forest from erosion on the side of Mount Entoto – while helping people train for new occupations.

I travelled to Mozambique, where I saw the importance of weather resilient infrastructure, donor coordination and country leadership during crisis response. The country was hit hard by cyclones Idai and Kenneth, and President Nyusi shared with me the catastrophic impact that affected millions of people. I met with the representatives of donor countries, and visited Beira, Mozambique’s second largest port, which suffered a direct hit from cyclone Idai. Through the National Disaster Management Institute, and with the support of more than 14 countries, the government has led a massive crisis response, involving 1,000 aid workers from 188 organizations. The Bank has coordinated closely with the Government, UN agencies and donors to harmonize response. Within one month of Idai’s landfall, over a million people received food assistance, some 907,000 received clean water, and 745,000 were vaccinated against cholera. The port was also back in operation as the city cleaned up. This was partly thanks to a World Bank co-investment with Germany’s KfW for a stormwater drainage system whose 11 kilometers of canals and flood control systems prevented the city from flooding. The project includes solar-powered street lighting, which at some point was the only source of light in the city.

To supplement the recovery from the devastating cyclones, we announced nearly $700 million in support for Mozambique, along with Malawi and Zimbabwe. Mozambique will receive $350 million from our IDA Crisis Response Window to re-establish the water supply; rebuild damaged public infrastructure and crops; and support disease prevention, food security, social protection, and early warning systems in the impacted communities.

One would not expect a discourteous gesture from a Prime Minister. But Imran Khan it is. The occasion was the Organisation of Islamic Summit last week when Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan met Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz and exchanged a few greetings, but wait, what? Just before the King could reciprocate to Imran's words, the cricketer-turned-politician chose to walk away unabashedly.

Let us explain how did the events unfold.

Khan walked up to the elaborate red carpet towards Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz. It was followed by a brief handshake and greetings. Imran Khan addressed the royal's translator rather than looking at him directly. The Pakistani prime minister then walked away while the translator was still explaining Khan's conversation to the monarch. Infact, Khan's body language looked casual throughout his meeting with the Saudi King.

The OIC meeting was hosted by Saudi Arabia in Makkah last week. The meeting of OIC, a 57-nation group, aimed at galvanising support among Arab and Islamic nations against arch-rival Iran.

Soon after the video went viral, several social media users slammed Imran Khan and called his gesture ""disrespectful"" and ""insulting"". Some asked Pakistan to prioritise diplomacy skills when they choose their next leader.

93,93,FL-2019-000057-IDN,[Photos] Mining in Kodingamali impacts indigenous community - Mongabay-India,https://india.mongabay.com/2019/06/photos-mining-in-kodingamali-impacts-indigenous-community/,"Mining activities are impacting the indigenous people living in Odisha’s Kodingamali region and their climate-friendly traditions.

Water pollution, air pollution, damage to building structures are some of the issues faced by the residents due to mining activities. Villagers who were promised jobs have had to quit due to non-payment of salaries.

The residents are migrating from their traditional habitats to other states seeking better livelihood options. A large number of tribal people from south Odisha seasonally migrate to Kerala and Tamil Nadu to work in brick kilns.

The indigenous people (adivasis) living around the Kodingamali hill in Koraput district of the state of Odisha have launched a fresh agitation against the Odisha Mining Corporation (OMC). Aggrieved by the damages caused by bauxite mining at Kodingamali, they are demanding that mining in the region be stopped forthwith. These villages, under eight panchayats of three blocks in the district, lie on the fringes of the Kodingamali hill and are affected by the mining activities in the region.

The mining project was started last year. In February 2018, soon after obtaining clearances for the Kodingamali bauxite mine, the government of Odisha introduced a new bauxite linkage policy. The OMC signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Indian mining company Vedanta, to supply 70 percent of the bauxite obtained from Kodingamali to Vedanta’s refinery situated about 150 km away at Lanjigarh in Kalahandi district. Vedanta had earlier been importing bauxite from countries like Brazil and Guinea as well as neighbouring states like Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh to feed its 2 mtpa (million tons per annum) refinery.

In 2017, OMC received forest clearance for developing a new bauxite mine in 435 hectares of forest land in the Kodingamali hill region. Soon after this, a mining contractor, Mythri Infra, was hired for excavation and mining of bauxite ore at Kodingamali. The company initially employed local villagers as security guards and transportation workers, and many villagers in Dasamantpur block joined Mythri’s mining project. “We were told that mining would usher in infrastructure development in the region, but in reality, Mythri and the OMC have been exploiting us once the company began its operations,” said a local resident Sambar Muduli.

“I was told I would be paid nine thousand rupees per month as salary and additional benefits like provident fund and health insurance, but all I got was five thousand rupees a month and nothing else,” said Sanjit Kumar Khosla, one of the security guards in the company who worked for nine months in the organisation and has now quit his job. Many adivasis like him have stopped working in the company and are demanding a proper salary from the mining infrastructure development company.

Khosla further said, “We approached the district administration, the local member of the legislative assembly (MLA) and the OMC and complained about the ongoing irregularities, but all we got was assurances and nothing else. Now mining here does not benefit us in any way. We want our Mali (hill) back, it belongs to us.”","Wed, 05 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2019/06/05105320/Bhaduri-Kodingamali-01.jpg,"['villagers', 'hill', 'bauxite', 'kodingamali', 'photos', 'mining', 'community', 'company', 'odisha', 'indigenous', 'region', 'omc', 'impacts', 'district']", 
94,94,FL-2019-000057-IDN,Congress Finally to Send $19B Disaster Aid Bill to Trump - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/usa/us-politics/congress-finally-send-19b-disaster-aid-bill-trump,"Congress is finally shipping President Donald Trump a $19.1 billion disaster aid bill, a measure stalled for months by infighting, misjudgment, and a presidential feud with Democrats.

The House is approving the measure in its first significant action as it returns from a 10-day recess. It is slated for a Monday evening vote in which Republicans whose home districts have been hit by hurricanes, floods, tornadoes and fires are set to join with majority Democrats to deliver a big vote for the measure.

Conservative Republicans had held up the bill during the recess, objecting on three occasions to efforts by Democratic leaders to pass the bill by a voice vote requiring unanimity. They say the legislation — which reflects an increasingly permissive attitude in Washington on spending to address disasters that sooner or later hit every region of the country — shouldn't be rushed through without a recorded vote.

Along the way, House and Senate old-timers have seemed to outmaneuver the White House, though Trump personally prevailed upon Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., to drop a bid to free up billions of dollars for dredging and other harbor projects. The Senate passed the bill by a sweeping 85-8 vote on its way out of Washington May 23, a margin that reflected a consensus that the bill is long overdue.

The measure was initially held up over a fight between Trump and Democrats over aid to Puerto Rico that seems long settled.



""Some in our government refused to assist our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico who are still recovering from a 2017 hurricane. I'm pleased we've moved past that,"" said House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y. ""Because when disaster strikes, we shouldn't let a ZIP code dictate our response.""

?Migrant issue



The measure also faced delays amid failed talks on Trump's $4 billion-plus request to care for thousands of mostly Central American migrants being held at the southern border. The sides narrowed their differences but couldn't reach agreement in the rush to go on recess but everyone agrees that another bill will be needed almost immediately to refill nearly empty agency accounts to care for migrants.

The measure is largely the same as a version that passed the House last month that Republicans opposed for leaving out the border funding.

""We must work together quickly to pass a bill that addresses the surge of unaccompanied children crossing the border and provides law enforcement agencies with the funding they need,"" said top Appropriations Committee Republican Kay Granger of Texas. ""The stakes are high. There are serious — life or death — repercussions if the Congress does not act.""



Among the reasons was a demand by House liberals to block the Homeland Security Department from getting information from federal social welfare authorities to help track immigrants residing in the U.S. illegally who take migrant refugee children into their homes.

?Floods, tornadoes

As the measure languished, disasters kept coming — with failed levees in Arkansas, Iowa and Missouri and tornadoes across Ohio just the most recent examples. The measure is supported by the bipartisan party leadership in both House and Senate.

The legislation is also being driven by Florida and Georgia lawmakers steaming with frustration over delays in delivering help to farmers, towns, and military bases slammed by hurricanes last fall. Flooding in Iowa and Nebraska this spring added to the coalition behind the measure, which delivers much of its help to regions where Trump supporters dominate.

The bill started out as a modest $7.8 billion measure passed in the last days of House GOP control. A $14 billion version advanced in the Pelosi-led chamber in January and ballooned to $19.1 billion by the time it emerged from the floor last month, fed by new funding for community rehabilitation projects, Army Corps of Engineers water and flood protection projects, and rebuilding funds for several military bases, including Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska.

Many Republicans opposed funding to mitigate future disasters as part of rebuilding projects when Superstorm Sandy funding passed in 2013 only to embrace it now that areas such as suburban Houston need it. Democrats, for their part, held firm for what ended up as roughly $1.4 billion for Puerto Rico, letting Trump feud with the U.S. territory's Democratic officials for weeks and deflecting political blame for stalling the bill.","Mon, 03 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/9CCBC32C-7D76-4723-889B-7D2DA5579D6B.jpg,"['bill', 'projects', 'finally', 'trump', 'stand', 'border', 'billion', 'send', 'republicans', 'disaster', 'vote', 'measure', 'house', '19b', 'aid', 'congress']",

96,96,FL-2019-000057-IDN,How mangroves protect people from increasingly frequent and powerful tropical storms - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/how-mangroves-protect-people-from-increasingly-frequent-and-powerful-tropical-storms-118200,"Mangroves are incredibly productive coastal ecosystems found in the tropics and subtropics. These dense green forests are known for their bizarre-looking roots that poke up into the air from shallow water. Among the meshed webs of roots are fish nurseries, enabling humans to make a living from the marine life in and around the mangroves.

Mangroves also play another important role for humans, protecting communities from major storms. Climate change is more than rising temperatures, and the increased frequency and intensity of cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons is apparent. Cyclone Fani for example, which recently struck the Bay of Bengal, was one of the strongest to devastate India in the past 20 years.

Mangrove roots can break up the force of a storm surge, soaking up some of its energy and protecting people living on coasts from cyclone damage. Yet it is a challenge to effectively value and protect individual mangrove ecosystems. And we just don’t have the people or funds to deliver detailed studies for even a fraction of the villages and towns sheltered by mangroves.

Reliable global rule of thumb

That is where we need a global rule of thumb that can be applied anywhere. It needs to be rigorously evidenced, and trusted enough for economic values to be used in planning calculations by governments and financial institutions. This is provided for coastal mangrove protection by an innovative new study in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Jacob Hochard and colleagues use global data covering nearly 2,000 coastal communities in 23 countries and 194 mangrove areas. Meticulous statistical analysis of cyclones from 2000 to 2012 provides a convincing model of how economic activity is impacted and recovers. It is well established that how brightly lit an area is at night correlates to its economic activity. Hochard’s innovation is to compare satellite imagery data of nighttime light levels with a timeline of cyclones. Economic losses are estimated from reduced nighttime light levels.

The area of mangrove protecting a community is divided by the length of coastline to give an average extent of mangrove per metre of coast. The authors compare how typical communities protected by smaller areas of mangrove (6m per metre of coastline average) fared over the long term versus communities with larger areas of mangroves (25m per metre average).

As differing levels of wealth make it tough to directly compare the economic impacts of mangroves in, say, Florida and Haiti, Hochard and colleagues instead express losses not in US dollar value but as relative to months of economic productivity.

Losses per cyclone for communities with 6m of mangroves per metre of coastline were double that of communities protected by 25m per m of mangroves. In the former group, losses are somewhere between 5.5 and 6.5 months of economic activity. In the latter, the extra mangroves kept cyclone impacts down to between 2.5 and 5.5 months.

Mangroves and the wider blue economy

Mangrove forests cover just 0.5% of the world’s coasts but account for an estimated 10-15% of coastal carbon capture. As we try to stop CO₂ levels rising and put the brakes on climate change, protecting mangroves for their blue carbon value is key.

Mangrove protection from cyclones also reduces longer term deterioration of low-lying inland areas with rising sea levels. Storm surges and flooding from cyclones, which deposit salts, are greater without mangrove protection. In Bangladesh, for example, rice agriculture is increasingly impossible as fields are flooded with seawater. One way communities are adapting is to shift production to shrimp farms. Booming shrimp aquaculture, however, ironically requires further mangrove clearance to create space – as seen graphically in Sri Lanka. Loss of mangrove protection from cyclones then worsens coastal deterioration.

Mangroves aren’t only lost to aquaculture, or harvested for wood, however. Mangroves are strongly affected, for example, by polluted freshwater flowing to the coast. Conflicting objectives at different levels of government and in different locations need joining up. And mangroves are just one aspect of coastal ecosystems and economies – effective management will mean integration with seagrass systems, coral reefs and so on.

The complexity is daunting. We need to be able to act using general principles that can be translated to the great majority of locations for which there are not the resources for local studies. Robustly evidenced global models such as this make that possible. The clock is ticking as mangroves are rapidly lost worldwide.","Mon, 03 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/277628/original/file-20190603-69091-1ro0q40.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C326%2C5190%2C2595&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['protection', 'coastal', 'increasingly', 'mangroves', 'frequent', 'protect', 'economic', 'powerful', 'mangrove', 'cyclones', 'levels', 'communities', 'metre', 'storms', 'protecting', 'tropical']",

All countries are affected by the direct/indirect impacts of climate change in one or other way. The issue of climate change has grabbed the attention of the world today as it has never before. It has become a major scientific as well as political topic of our times. Despite high profile international action to slow its progress, the political will to address its current impacts remains weak.

Unfortunately, the countries which are least responsible for climate change are also bearing the most severe consequences of it. Climate change is increasingly causing storms, droughts and floods, resulting in the rise of sea levels and having a severe impact on food production, and thus, forcing a large number of people to flee their homes and lands for sanctuary in safer lands. However, there is no consensus on whether these people can be called ‘climate refugees’ – as international law does not acknowledge such a term.

Climate-induced migration

Climate change poses a formidable challenge for all countries and it is more likely to heighten the scale of political turmoil, state instability and mass migration in the future, particularly in the regions with poor governance and existing state fragility. Climate-induced migration has been recorded in many regions around the world. As per the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre’ (IDMC) report, 23.5 million people were forced to relocate around the world in 2016 alone due to extreme weather conditions and as a result of natural disasters. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) predicts even greater displacement owing to climate change in the years to come. The Asian Development Bank in its report predicted that approximately 37 million people in India, 22 million in China, and 21 million in Indonesia will be at risk of displacement from rising sea levels by 2050. The World Bank in its report also predicted that around 143 million people could be displaced due to climate change by 2050.

Climate change is a trans-border issue and thus needs a trans-border solution. The multidimensional and complex challenges posed by climate change must be factored into international norms and legal instruments dealing with displacement and migration. International environmental law and international human rights law can be a robust and appropriate mechanism to support developing countries in their response to the adverse impacts of climate changei]. However, under the present international law, there is no agreement, convention or treaty which deals with climate-induced migrants.

The Asian Development Bank in its report predicted that approximately 37 million people in India, 22 million in China, and 21 million in Indonesia will be at risk of displacement from rising sea levels by 2050. The World Bank in its report also predicted that around 143 million people could be displaced due to climate change by 2050.

The most recent international climate agreement, the Paris Agreement 2015, contains a number of ambitious provisions, however, the one urgent area where it does not go far enough is climate-induced migration. Also, the New York Declaration on Refugees and Migrants 2017 which is the latest international agreement under the aegis of United Nations for the protection of rights of refugees and migrants has failed to address the issue of climate refugees – millions of migrants who are displaced by natural and slow onset environmental changes. Even in the time when climate change is becoming a driving force for people to leave their homes, the rules and principles are written only for those who are escaping war zones.

Climate refugees are the human face and human cost of the climate change but they are not receiving the international attention and resources they demand.

Climate Refugees under International law

There is no standard definition and no such category of refugees exists under international law. Legally the concept of ‘climate refugee’ does not exist, despite the term being in frequent use. Moreover, there is no consensus that ‘climate refugees’ are ‘refugees’ at all. The need for a definition is a crucial step in the conceptualisation of climate migration and the development of policy responses to address these flows.

The United Nations Convention relating to the Status of the Refugee 1951 (Refugee Convention, 1951) defined a ‘refugee’ as any person who

“as a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951 and owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing such fear, is unwilling to return to it”.

It was Essam El-Hinnawai, who coined the word ‘environmental refugees’ in a report[ii]prepared for the United Nations Environment Programme in 1985. He defined ‘environmental refugees’ as:

“Any person who has been forced to leave their traditional habitat, temporarily or permanently, because of a marked environmental disruption (natural and/or triggered by people) that jeopardised their existence and/or seriously affected the quality of their life are”.

On the basis of this definition given by Essam El-Hinnawai, one may identify three categories of refugees as environmental refugees: (a) those displaced temporarily because of an environmental stress, such as an earthquake or a cyclone, and who will return to their habitat once conditions normalise; (b) those who have been permanently displaced because of a permanent change caused to their habitat, such as the establishment of dams and associated man-made lakes; and (c) those who migrate permanently or temporarily in quest of an improved quality of life because their original habitat can no longer meet their basic needs[iii].

The International Organisation for Migration also released a ‘working definition’ of ‘environmental migrants’ in 2008, but this definition has not been adopted under any national or international law. It says that,

“Environmental migrants are persons or groups of persons who, predominantly for reasons of sudden or progressive change in the environment that adversely affects their lives or living conditions, are obliged to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily or permanently, and who move either within their country or aboard”.

There are also cases where due to extreme climate conditions people move within the borders of their countries. These affected populations are referred to as “internally displaced” population and they remain under the protection of their government and continue to be subject of domestic laws and national policy and thus they are overshadowed. But there is an obvious link between internal and cross-border displacement, the exact push and pull factors that explain how someone who is an internally displaced person one day can become a refugee, an asylum seeker or an international migrant the next day is still unclear.

Under international law, only those people who have fled their countries because of war or persecution are entitled to refugee status. People who are forced to leave their homes because of climate change, or who leave their homes because climate change has made it harder for them to make a living, do not fall under the status of ‘refugee’ as defined in Article 1 of the Refugee Convention 1951. The law does not offer them much protection.

People who are forced to leave their homes because of climate change, or who leave their homes because climate change has made it harder for them to make a living, do not fall under the status of ‘refugee’ as defined in Article 1 of the Refugee Convention 1951. The law does not offer them much protection at all unless they can show they are fleeing a war zone or face persecution if they are returned home.

In recent times, it is seen that even countries which are signatories to and have ratified the Refugee Convention 1951 do not follow it in the true spirit which makes the whole problem more complex and difficult. The refugees have to either move courts or other adjudicatory bodies to claim their rights under the said convention. For climate refugees, the situation is more difficult and harsh; neither do they have any legal recognition nor do they have any legal rights under any international or regional instrument. A judgment of the New Zealand Supreme Court in the Kiribati case[iv]is pertinent to this discussion. In this preferred case, the court rejected an application for grant of refugee status on grounds of climate change in the Pacific Island nation of Kiribati. The reasoning of the Court was backed on the lack of environmental degradation as ground under the Refugee Convention 1951. However, New Zealand was not the first state to refuse entry to an environmental refugee; this has previously been done by the Australian Courts[v], and even by the Indian government[vi]. Moreover, there are instances where the state raises respect for sovereignty as a ground for rejecting refugees and argues that they have the sole discretion to determine whether a foreigner should be given entrance to their dominion[vii].

Climate Change, Refugees and India

How vulnerable is India to climate change and climate refugees? India is growing at a rapid pace and in the future, will be working hard towards eradicating poverty and giving its people a satisfactory standard of living, a major goal since its independence in August 1947. But climate change is likely to slow down India’s growth towards reaching this goal and would make it more vulnerable than any other country.

In addition to these vulnerabilities, the continuous natural disasters, political instability and poor resilience infrastructure in the neighbouring countries are continuously increasing the burden on India. If we look at India’s engagement on climate change over the last couple of decades then we largely observe a story of continuity; the period leading up to the 2015 Paris Agreement saw serious reconsiderations of views, both within and outside government, on what India’s’ interests and positions on the issue ought to be. However, if the world’s second most populous country collapses environmentally then it will have a devastating impact on the entire region.

India has been a safe haven for climate refugees from Bangladesh and Nepal who mostly migrate to metro cities and end up in decrepit slums. Given the issue of India’s own climate-induced internal migration and already saturated metro cities – providing domestic and international climate refugees with a basic standard of living is impossible. India in the past has been flooded with climate refugees. The examples of this may include, the migration of Chakmas and other tribes of Bangladesh into parts of India’s north-east, and that of poor Bangladeshis particularly from the Khulna and Rajshahi divisions into various parts of India[viii].

Researchers in Assam, India and in Bangladesh have estimated that around a million people have been rendered homeless due to erosion in the Brahmaputra river basin over the last three decades. Sunderbans, the world’s largest mangrove forest and a low-lying delta region in the Bay of Bengal where some 13 million impoverished Indians and Bangladeshis live, is particularly susceptible to climate change. It is already suffering increased incidents of floods, cyclones, saltwater infusion and rises in sea levels, resulting in land erosion and submergence of islands. On the other hand, the problems of droughts, forest fires and flooding in Nepal has been magnified by the impacts of climate change, resulting in mass loss of habitats and livelihood.

Sunderbans, the world’s largest mangrove forest and a low-lying delta region in the Bay of Bengal where some 13 million impoverished Indians and Bangladeshis live, is particularly susceptible to climate change.

Also, in the recent past, a series of powerful hurricanes originating from the Bay of Bengal have increased the danger and vulnerability of densely populated cities on the Eastern Ghats of India and has had a severe impact on Bangladesh. Rising sea levels and dying coral reefs are making the isles of the Maldives inhabitable and within a decade the circumstances would be such that it will force people to flee these islands, as reports claim.

Given the above circumstances and vulnerabilities, it is in India’s interest to work on a regional policy framework for managing any such exodus of climate refugees. Former minister, Environment and Forests, Suresh Prabhu in his commentary[ix]on ‘Climate Change and Parliament’ pushes that, “all the international agreements and commitments should be subject to compulsory parliamentary ratification in India. We can even use the Standing Committee route to create more space for debate on climate change”. This could possibly be a solution for bringing India under the international legal regime and also to lead India to participate more in formulating these governing policies. In future, India could be a driving force not just in formulating these international principles but also as a regulator on these issues. For this purpose, what we need is a strong mandate on the subject, commitment and visionary leadership.

India can lead the world by stimulating the debate on the subject and can ease the regional tensions by formulating a model framework to deal with climate refugees. We can play an important role in negotiating for the rules and principles for the protection of climate-induced migrants and can be an influential voice to bring out a coalition for a strong mandate on climate refugees through its clear and strong vision in international climate negotiations.

Slowly, the guests began to arrive, reports the Killeen Daily Herald. As each person showed up, some bringing their families, smiles split faces and hugs were given as if they had not seen each other in years.

They were all “family,” after all — former members of 3rd Battalion, 16th Field Artillery Regiment, 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division. Most were part of the unit three years ago. One is an active-duty soldier who was a part of the training when a military vehicle overturned in a Fort Hood low-water crossing, killing eight soldiers and one West Point cadet.

NCO blamed for accident that killed nine soldiers at Fort Hood Flash flood warnings had been issued and the crossing had been designated off-limits, but a platoon heading out for some Sergeant’s Time training on the morning of June 2, 2016 didn’t know that.

One attendee at Saturday's barbecue is one of the three survivors of the 12 soldiers originally on the light, medium tactical vehicle, or LMTV — an Army truck — involved in the June 2, 2016, accident. The father of another of the survivors also attended.

All had gathered to honor and remember the fallen — most still live in the Killeen area, so they gather to ensure the military brothers and sisters they lost that day will never be forgotten.

It was a day that changed the life of then Spc. Tyrail Friend forever, a day when an angel saved his life, he said.

Flash flood warnings had been going off on soldiers' phones all morning, Friend said, and everyone was rather uneasy about going out into the field.

""Nobody wanted to go out there, you know what I mean?"" Friend said. ""It wasn't something that needed to be done. (Staff Sgt. Miguel Angel Colonvazquez) went to go talk to our platoon leader. I'm not sure what the conversation was, but ... we had no choice, we had to go. We did what we were told to do, like every other day.""

So Colonvazquez, along with Friend, Spc. Christine Faith Armstrong, Spc. Rogelio Morales Jr., Spc. Kameron Robinson, Pfc. Brandon Austin Banner, Pfc. Zachery Nathaniel Fuller, Pvt. Isaac Lee DeLeon, Pvt. Eddy Raelaurin Gates, Pvt. Tysheena Lynette James, Spc. Yingming Sun and U.S. Military Academy at West Point Cadet Mitchell Alexander Winey loaded into the LMTV and headed out for training.

The ride out wasn't really anything special, Friend said, and he didn't really know anything was going wrong until the LMTV seemed to hit a bump and then start weaving, as if they were on a boat.

""It was like you could feel yourself floating. I was like, this don't feel right,"" he said. ""Water started coming in and everybody froze. I pushed the tarp up and it looked like I was on the ocean. I looked to the front of the truck and I could see it was starting to turn.""

Friend said he jumped over the back gate of the LMTV, thinking he could swim to safety. The current was so strong, however, he was immediately in a fight for his life.

""I kept trying to hold on to something, but everything kept breaking — everything ... would break, that's how fast I was going,"" he said. ""The current kept sending me under, and for some reason I kept thinking, 'this can't be happening.' It didn't really hit that it was real until I realized I didn't have any more breath.""

The muscle fatigue from fighting the current turned his arms into ""limp noodles,"" Friend said. The next thing he knew he was fully underwater with no breath left.

""I remember seeing flashes of my kids, my wife. I'm thinking to myself, 'I'm dying.' I was just praying in my head,"" he said. ""I kept saying, 'Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,' and then I saw an angel lifting me up.""

Coming out of the water felt as if someone had grabbed onto his uniform at his shoulders and jerked him out, he said.

""I got to the top of the water and it felt like I had had my air the whole time,"" Friend recalled. ""It was like (the angel) blew air into my lungs.""

Friend was able to grab a branch that held and began screaming for help. The body of Armstrong floated past him and he tried to grab her while holding onto the branch.

""She was already dead, but I tried to grab her,"" he said. ""I couldn't get her.""

Friend said he couldn't recall how long it took for him to be rescued, but the near-death experience has given him a new perspective on life.

""That was the most fear I've ever felt in my life,"" he said. ""I wasn't thinking about dying, but now I think about it every day. I felt like I could have done something more (to save the others). I had survivor's guilt, and had it for a while — sometimes I still do.""

Survivor of 2016 Fort Hood training accident recalls flood On June 2, 2016, Kameron Robinson was riding in the truck that rolled over in flooded Owl Creek on Fort Hood, claiming the lives of eight soldiers and a West Point cadet.

A lot of counseling, therapy and telling the story has made it easier on him over time, Friend said.

""It makes you more grateful for everything,"" he said. ""Anything you used to think is a problem is really not. It could be a lot worse. And even if it's not worse, you're not dead.""

One of those helping Friend and the other veterans with the unit during the accident to cope has been ""Papa Rog"" — Rogelio Morales Sr., father of Morales Jr., who is attending college in Pennsylvania and could not make it to Saturday's event.

""These guys are like my sons, my kids — we all bonded like one big family,"" he said. ""They're always at my house.""

The day of the accident was a normal day for Papa Rog, sitting on the back porch of his Pennsylvania home enjoying the weather when his son called.

""He said, 'Pops, I was in an accident.' That's all he said,"" the senior Morales recalled. ""I said, 'Are you OK?' He said, 'Yeah, but a lot of my buddies died.' The next day, I was down here (in Killeen).""

Morales Sr. said he came down by himself at first, followed soon by his wife and they made Killeen their home to be close to their son and his fellow soldiers.

""At first it was hard. These guys ... I tell them they're my kids. I advise them,"" he said. ""I've been blessed with all these guys. I'm not a rich man, but I'm rich at heart (because of them).""

Papa Rog has been a big part of the healing process for many of the soldiers, according to Dasheen Perry, a former soldier who was a private new to the unit when the accident occurred. He was in the motor pool when he found out that Banner, the soldier who had welcomed him to the unit with open arms, had died.

""I tried to follow what he showed me for the few days that I knew him,"" he said. ""It hurt me to find out he passed away in the accident.""

Perry was on a cleaning detail at the time and said he remembers that it was continually raining. All of a sudden, people started running around everywhere and the motor pool descended into chaos.

""I see people crying. The whole time, I'm lost, I don't know what's going on,"" he said. ""When I finally figured out what was going on, two or three convoys were headed out to go look for everybody.""

Perry said the unit tried to keep details of the accident a secret for a while, but as soon as news surfaced of the deaths, it really hit home to the soldiers what had happened. They were not allowed to talk about it, however.

""I remember it was all the way up until November or December of that year, they were still telling us 'don't talk to the media,'"" he said. ""Me not knowing the severity of it, I just stayed in my place and didn't say anything.""

No longer in the Army and with more experience, Perry said he personally feels blame never should have been placed on Colonvazquez — the top ranked enlisted soldier who was conducting the training.

""Orders came from somewhere,"" he said. ""And he's not here to speak for himself.""

Perry added he felt the Army would never reveal what actually happened that day, preferring to lay blame somewhere and forgetting about it. Until then, those still in the area from the unit that day will continue to remember those who were lost.

“That’s what this is all about,” he said of the gathering at the park. “Let’s get the family together, those who are here. Let’s remember them.”","Mon, 03 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/WLV_Jx5hz4NnBwtuwvaOottisIA=/1200x630/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-mco.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DW4G5FQC2JEBJPD4PCAXZQZCRI.jpg,"['training', 'troops', 'killeen', 'families', 'day', 'im', 'army', 'recall', 'fort', 'killed', 'hood', 'soldiers', 'friend', '2016', 'going', 'unit', 'accident']",
