Ten miners had been confirmed dead in the Zengjiagou Coal Mine flooding in Dazhou, Sichuan Province, which occurred around 10 a.m. Monday when 30 miners were working underground.

By 5 p.m., rescuers had recovered 10 bodies out of the flooded shaft at the the Zengjiagou Coal Mine in the city of Dazhou, and two remained trapped underground, said a spokesman with the provincial work safety bureau.

The flood occurred around 10 a.m. Monday, when 30 miners were working underground. Eighteen of the miners managed to escape.

Rescuers are working to reach the missing, the spokesman said.

A manager in charge of safety had been detained and the owner of the coal mine was under police custody, he said.","Sun, 04 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",,"['coal', 'zengjiagou', 'sw', 'miners', 'underground', 'spokesman', 'sichuan', 'confirmed', 'working', 'province', 'occurred', 'safety', 'flooding', 'dead', 'china']", 
1,1,FL-2011-000139-CHN,Gov't initially 'mishandled' `06 flood response -US ambassador said in cable - Stabroek News,https://www.stabroeknews.com/2011/08/29/news/guyana/gov%E2%80%99t-initially-%E2%80%98mishandled%E2%80%99-06-flood-response-us-ambassador-said-in-cable-2/,"A year after the worst flood in the country’s recent history devastated areas along the coastland, the administration botched its initial response to the returning heavy rainfall, which necessitated a massive public relations exercise and a relief spending effort.

This was former US Ambassador Roland Bullen’s assessment of the government’s response to the flooding between December 2005 and January 2006, and he suggested that the initial “underestimate” of the situation showed that lessons of the previous year had not been learned.

“What is not questionable is the GoG[Government of Guyana]’s mishandling of the flood situation. After initially dismissing the media’s coverage of the flood problem as overblown, then saying it had not been properly kept abreast of the situation, the GoG is now engaged in a high profile scramble to address the matter,” he said in the January 13, 2006 diplomatic note released by WikiLeaks.

Bullen further noted that this “inept response presented opposition parties with a golden opportunity to score political points with a disaffected Guyanese public in an election year, but the rudderless opposition failed to capitalize.”

He said that many of the affected areas were also underwater during the previous year’s devastating floods. “The absence of simple factual data about levels of rainfall and status of drainage infrastructure combined with the GoG’s incoherent approach suggests that Guyana has learned little from the past and remains at the mercy of the rains,” he declared.

Flooding attributed to seasonally high rains had been plaguing most of coastal Guyana except greater Georgetown since the end of December, Bullen explained in his report. He further cited the Stabroek News’ report on December 25 that flooding in the eastern region of Mahaicony had been occurring for a week and the follow up on January 5 about flooding in Black Bush

Polder, in the Corentyne, and later about Canals 1 and 2 polders on the West Bank of Demerara, in the backlands of the Essequibo coast and the Pomeroon River region.

He did note that these were all agricultural areas a few miles inland from the coastal strip where 90% of Guyana’s population lives.

According to Bullen, after an initially slow response, the GoG has mobilized “a highly public flood relief campaign, with virtually every cabinet minister visiting one of the affected regions.”

Bullen said the Embassy had also been receiving data from the Hydromet Office, but pointed out that the data was of limited use, since 13 of 14 rainfall gauges were on the coast and therefore did not report interior rainfall.

Later, in a follow-up cable, dated January 17, 2006, Bullen also referred to the lack of adequate information on rainfall at the conservancy. He said that after a meeting held by the government with donors, the Head of the Civil Defence Commission, Chabilall Ramsarup acknowledged that there were no rainfall gauges in the conservancy or the conservancy watersheds “so assessing how much water is draining relative to how much is falling is impossible.” Bullen also cited the difficulty of obtaining accurate information on the EDWC. He said that on January 17, 2006 at a meeting of the Guyana Citizens’ Initiative for Flood Relief, Major General (ret) Joe Singh had said that the level that day in the EDWC was 58.65 GD (an increase of one inch overnight) and that he expected the Lama sluice to be opened immediately. Bullen said that an EDWC engineer related to embassy’s consul that same day that the EDWC level was 58.4 GD compared to the 58.5 GD the day before. Further, the engineer said that the Lama sluice was not open. “Such conflicting reports reflect the difficulty of obtaining accurate data on the status of the EDWC”, he said in the cable.

Bullen concluded that there are two major differences between the response in 2005 and that in 2006. He explained that the interventions after the 2005 floods to restore the drainage and irrigation infrastructure, while “leaving much to be desired,” worked. “Georgetown and the populated East Coast have not so far experienced and serious or sustained flooding, although many buildings built on ground in violation of building codes have experienced intermittent water intrusion,” he said.

Additionally, he said in 2006, the GoG was much more pro-active in sharing information and consulting concerned constituencies, including the donor community and the political opposition. “This in turn provides an environment in which people are able to make better-in-formed decisions and a political environment in which the government and opposition can concentrate on managing the situation rather than harping at each other,” he added.","Mon, 29 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2019/06/sn-article-default.png,"['flood', 'data', '2006', 'bullen', '06', 'mishandled', 'ambassador', 'opposition', 'response', 'govt', 'rainfall', 'initially', 'cable', 'situation', 'edwc', 'flooding']",

Aug. 30, 2011 -- Flooding across parts of the East Coast is still a major issue after Hurricane Irene as the death toll rises to 40 across 11 states. Thousands still find themselves stranded and without electricity for days to come.

The death toll, which extended from North Carolina to Vermont, rose sharply as bodies were pulled from floodwaters and people were electrocuted by downed power lines.

Eighteen of the 40 Irene-related deaths were in the New York tristate area and New England -- seven in New Jersey, six in New York, and two in Connecticut and three in Vermont.

Some believe that not enough attention was paid to the inland regions, even though it was clear they'd be hit with massive and unbearable amounts of rain.

""More attention should have been paid to the torrential rain that Irene was going to dump not only on coastal areas but also inland. That was clear several days ahead of time,"" said Shaun Tanner, a meteorologist at the forecasting service Weather Underground.

Vermont, where wind gusts hit at 60 mph, is currently experiencing the worst flooding the state has seen in 84 years, which has the governor calling for ""all the help we can get."" At least two people are dead and one is missing in the state beset with knocked-out bridges and destroyed roadways.

Roads to a number of communities in the state remain cut off because of the flooding. A dozen bridges have been lost so far, including some of the state's iconic covered bridges.

At least 11 inches of rain was dumped on Vermont as Irene passed through. Rivers were already high from a wetter than average summer and heavy snowfall in the winter.

All Vermont state offices are closed, and the National Guard has deployed six rapid response teams.

""This event unfolded much faster than anyone anticipated,"" Vermont National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. Lloyd Goodrow said.

President Obama signed an emergency declaration for Vermont Monday morning.

""We're continuing to deal with the impact and the aftermath of Hurricane Irene,"" Obama said. ""We're going to make sure folks have all the support they need as they begin to assess and repair the damage left by the storm.""

In the 24 hours in areas north of New Jersey and in the environs of New York's Hudson River Valley, rainfall ranged from 5 to 15 inches in some places, according to a National Weather Service representative speaking on a Federal Emergency Management conference call Monday.

Serious flooding continued in New Jersey in the wake of Irene.

In Little Falls, N.J., floodwaters covered cars, and the city had set up a shelter for the 400,000 families that live in this area to ride out what would be an incredibly anxious night. The water rose at 2 inches an hour by one estimate.

""We're not out of the woods yet regarding this storm,"" Gov. Chris Christie told a gathering at the Raritan River in Manville, N.J. He said waters had hit record levels at nine locations and warned that the Passaic River had not yet crested.

The Passaic River in Little Falls rose overnight to 14 feet -- 7 feet above flood stage. Christine Leyva packed up her family when floodwaters reached her front door Monday.

""We just decided to leave before the flood got worse. It's really bad,"" she told ABC News' New York City station WABC.

The Ramapo, Pompton, Pequannock and Passaic rivers in Wayne, N.J., were also expected to crest sometime today. These rivers will remain at ""major flood"" levels through Thursday.

Although New York City managed to avoid a wallop from the storm, inland towns and counties upstate saw more than 13 inches of rain as the storm pummeled parts of the Hudson Valley.

Fallen branches and demolished bridges have hindered road travel across the area, while at least three towns in New York remain cut off by flooded roads and bridges.

This report was compiled by Vermont Public Radio's John Dillon.

In Massachusetts, 30,000 homes and businesses remained without power Friday morning, days after Tropical Storm Irene. But Vermont is dealing with even bigger problems.

President Obama has declared several flood-stricken counties in Vermont major disaster areas due to widespread damage from the storm.

Crews are still working to rebuild roads and restore essential services after the storm. And many Vermont homeowners and businesses are worried about the months ahead, as most did not have flood insurance.

The resort town of Wilmington is both a disaster area and a work zone. Construction crews worked to rebuild roads and bridges washed out by the Deerfield River. Volunteers hustled to board up windows and remove mud-caked inventory from battered stores.

It's usually a tidy town that caters to the resort economy. Now, dirt and mud are everywhere. And, with the sewage system out, the street corners feature a new, but much-needed attraction: portable toilets.

“This is a whole new element to the scenic vista of Vermont,"" said Ann Manwaring, a state representative from the area. ""We went and snitched them from the TransCanada recreation areas down at the lake.”

TransCanada is the utility that operates the nearby hydroelectric dam.

“Somebody called up Matt Cole who kind of runs TransCanada in the area and said, ‘Don’t be surprised. Your Porta Potties are going to be gone,' "" Manwaring said.

Manwaring toured the downtown village district where almost every business has suffered major damage. She pointed to a pile of colorful woolen yarn that came from a nearby knitting shop ravaged by the flood.

“That was one of her display cases,"" Manwaring said. ""And the folks who were gathering here just picked it all up and set it up in the display case and now I see it’s collapsed. It was a poignant story.”

One business owner in town has experienced disaster twice this year. In April, Lisa Sullivan lost her bookstore in Brattleboro when a fire swept through the building.

“And we now we lost Bartelby’s Books here,"" Sullivan said. ""But the devastation here in Wilmington is so great; it’s hard to think just about our business because it’s really the whole town.”

Sullivan says the immediate priority is repairing roads and infrastructure so the tourists can come back.

Route 9, the main east-west route, was torn apart in several places between Bennington and Brattleboro. Business owners say it has to be completely rebuilt by ski season. But Sullivan is also worried about the long term.","Fri, 02 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",http://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2011/09/0902_vt-floods.jpg,"['floods', 'rebuild', 'manwaring', 'towns', 'sullivan', 'irene', 'work', 'roads', 'disaster', 'tropical', 'business', 'storm', 'town', 'vermont']",

The artwork and china removed. The silverware is locked up. And the first family, along with their pups, are gone.

That’s the status of the Governor’s Residence today.

The Front Street Georgian-style mansion that houses Gov. Tom Corbett and wife Susan was evacuated Thursday to minimize the harm expected to be caused by the Susquehanna River that had already spilled over its banks in that area by the afternoon.

This is only the third time in the stately place’s 43-year history that it has been evacuated due to flooding, although Corbett said water has seeped into the basement on three occasions earlier this year.

The Corbetts were relocated, along with their dogs Penny and Harry, to quarters at Fort Indiantown Gap until floodwaters recede and it is safe for them to return to the mansion. Lt. Gov. Jim Cawley and his family remain in the lieutenant governor’s residence at the Gap.

State police cadets, National Guard troops and state employees spent the day preparing the mansion for what could be the worst flooding it has experienced since 1972, when floodwaters from Tropical Storm Agnes filled the basement and left about five feet of water standing on the first floor. The house was also evacuated as a precaution during the 1996 flood.

Cadets and camouflage-dressed soldiers were seen filling sandbags and placing them around the many doors and basement windows.

“We’re making this effort to keep the water out of the basement,” Corbett said, following an afternoon news conference at the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Susquehanna Twp. “All your electricity, all your HVAC is in the basement. If you lose that, first off, it’s going to be months before we get back in, but it’s a great deal of cost. So we’re making an effort to keep water out as well as we can.”

Crews also went to work to save state property.

Cadets and others emptied the basement and first floor of antique furniture, carpeting and other furnishings, moving them to the living quarters on the second floor or to the many moving vans parked outside. Gloved preservationists from the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission were on hand to carefully remove the valuable paintings that line the first-floor walls.

But Corbett didn’t get involved in the move, although he said his wife might have. Meanwhile, his dogs, who have lived in the residence for about a month, seemed confused by all the activity.

“The dogs were like, ‘What the heck is going on?’¤” he said.

Corbett said workers started the mammoth task of moving furniture around 7:30 a.m. Thursday. As he was leaving at 1:50 p.m. to come to PEMA’s headquarters, he said, “They were taking paint cans out of the basement. I didn’t go into the basement, but I think they did a good job if they were down to paint cans.”","Fri, 09 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.pennlive.com/resizer/RJYXfgD5ObD5JutH0o0IxNs0au8=/1280x0/smart/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width2048/img/patriot-news/photo/2011/09/lower-swatara-twp-flooding-c7a9f3502235a925.jpg,"['save', 'pennsylvania', 'evacuate', 'tries', 'floor', 'moving', 'mansion', 'flooded', 'corbett', 'basement', 'water', 'residence', 'corbetts', 'furniture', 'governors', 'crew', 'flooding']",

TOKYO - Typhoon Talas dumped record amounts of rain Sunday in western and central Japan, killing at least 20 people and stranding thousands more as it turned towns into lakes, washed away cars and triggered mudslides that obliterated houses. At least 50 people were missing, local media reported.

Evacuation orders and advisories were issued to 460,000 people in the region, which is hundreds of miles (kilometers) from the country's tsunami-ravaged northeastern coast.

At least 3,600 people were stranded by flooded rivers, landslides and collapsed bridges that were hampering rescue efforts, Kyodo News agency reported.

Public broadcaster NHK showed a bridge swept away after intense rain caused a river to swell with brown torrents. People holding umbrellas waded through knee-deep water in city streets and residential areas.

The typhoon dumped record amounts of rain in some areas, and more was expected. It was the country's worst storm since one in 2004 that left 98 people either dead or missing, the Yomiuri newspaper said. By Sunday, Talas had been downgraded to a tropical storm.

Ten people were killed and 32 were missing in Wakayama prefecture alone, police said. One landslide there buried three homes; a woman was killed and four people were missing, but a 14-year-old girl was rescued from the debris.

In nearby Nara prefecture, seven people were reported missing after their homes were swept down a river, NHK said. A 73-year-old man died in Nara when his house collapsed in a landslide, police said.

The storm damaged Nijojo castle in the ancient city of Kyoto, tearing a large piece of plaster from the gate wall. The castle, a popular tourist destination, is designated an important cultural treasure.

The center of the season's 12th typhoon crossed the southern island of Shikoku and the central part of the main island of Honshu overnight Saturday. It was moving slowly north across the Sea of Japan off the country's west coast, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.

Because of the storm's slow speed, the agency warned that heavy rains and strong winds were likely to continue. With the ground already soaked, fears of additional mudslides were growing, and the agency issued landslide warnings in nearly all of the country's prefectures.","Mon, 05 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20110905/f04da2db14840fce3ed804.jpg,"['20', 'prefecture', 'agency', 'typhoon', 'kills', 'countrys', 'missing', 'tropical', 'japan', 'storm', 'western', 'talas']",

Irene, still with winds at 50 mph, was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm and spared New York City the devastation many predicted, but it has not been so kind to the towns and cities in its path as it moved inland today.

The force of the storm's winds diminished Sunday, but the torrential rains did not let up, swelling rivers and streams until they burst their banks in upstate New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont.

Downtown Windham, N.Y., was ""wiped out"" by flooding, with 4 feet of water rushing through Main Street, said Michael Scarey, the town's fire chief.

Torrential rains that started Saturday night dumped more than 10 inches of water on the normally quiet community, forcing evacuations, submerging school buses and garages and shutting off access to the rest of the mountaintop.

West of the town, a house was ripped from its foundation and swallowed by the fast moving creek, which slammed it into a bridge.

There were similar scenes in other river towns in the storm's path today, and it is feared that things will only get worse as rivers peak.

""This is not over,"" President Barack Obama said late today in a brief address from the Rose Garden.

In Vermont, Brattleboro, Bennington, Montpelier and other towns had flooding from swollen rivers.

Irene did not cause quite the level of destruction many feared as it churned up the East Coast this weekend, but it packed enough punch to leave at least 20 dead, millions without power and an estimated $7 billion to $13 billion in damages.

""We're not out of the woods yet. Irene remains a large and potentially dangerous storm,"" U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said.

After roaring through coastal North Carolina on Saturday, Irene raked the coasts of Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey before hitting New York this morning as a tropical storm with 65 mph winds. By 10 a.m. today, patches of blue sky and sunshine began peeking through in lower Manhattan.

With its heavy rainfall and powerful winds, the storm created flood conditions up and down the East Coast. But Irene appeared to have caused less damage than anticipated in the New York area.

Philadelphia experienced significant local flooding in several areas, but subways, elevated trains and bus service in the city were beginning to return to activity on Sunday.

More than 4.5 million East Coast homes and businesses are without power and thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes, according to The Associated Press.

In New York City, the 370,000 residents who were ordered to evacuate their homes were allowed to return this afternoon beginning at 3 p.m.

Close to 2 million people lost power in the New York City area. The National Grid reported that 19,000-plus homes in Rhode Island lost power, and 6,000-plus homes are already without power in Massachusetts.

In lower Manhattan at Wall Street and South Street, water from New York's East River breached the seawall this morning, but has since receded.

Irene made landfall along the coast of New Jersey near Little Egg Inlet, just north of Atlantic City, around 5:35 a.m. The estimated intensity of at landfall was 75 mph.

It was the second time Irene made landfall since slamming into North Carolina Saturday.

While Irene's strength has declined and evacuated residents are returning home, government officials warned the public that the storm still poses safety dangers.

""We still have a ways to go with Irene,"" Napolitano said at Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) news conference.

Some areas are still prone to tidal flooding and heavy rains will be the ongoing issue as the storm passes through New England today to eastern Canada overnight, FEMA officials said.

Officials said it will take time to assess total damage costs but Peter Morici, a professor at University of Maryland, said the cost of Irene could surpass that of Hurricane Katrina.

""Revised estimates of the direct damage caused by Hurricane Irene are in the range of $20 billion. Add to those the loss of about two days economic activity, spread over a week, across 25 percent of the economy, and an estimate of the losses imposed by Irene is about $40 billion to 45 billion,"" Morici said.

Loss of Life

At least 20 people have reportedly died as a result of Irene's assault on the East Coast, including victims of car accidents and falling tree limbs. The storm victims include two children: an 11-year-old boy in Virginia, and a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina.

""Put it this way, the whole township is going to be affected,"" said Deputy Police Chief Gary Manna. ""By 8 p.m. tonight, (Route) 46 will probably be closed and you will not be able to get in or out.""

Authorities are now anticipating a river crest of 23.2 feet, roughly 4 feet above flood stage. Manna said if that happens it will be the worst flood since 1903.

While much of the afternoon was sunny, gray clouds crept in above Fairfield and wind speeds picked up, likely the ""back end"" of Irene, authorities said.

Along Big Piece Road, which abuts a swamp by the Passaic, water was ankle deep along the roadway, and neighbors of this community, grown tight knit over a decade of flooding, speculated about the coming days and prepared for the worst.

""You can come get me out?"" Steve Markovski asked of his neighbor Al Zaccaro.

""Just call me, I'll come in my boat,"" Zaccaro replied.

The two men have weathered these storms before, but nothing like Irene's after-effects have been seen here since Hurricane Gloria in 1984.

The township, once primarily farmland, has been made more vulnerable by a decade of development in the surrounding areas.

""They just keep building and building and building,"" Zaccaro said. ""Where's all that water supposed to go?""

When asked what recourse the community had, Markovski said, ""You can't do anything about it. What, are you going to sell the house? Who's going to buy it?""

The Schubert family has been in Fairfield for 112 years. Roger Schubert, 63, has lived here his whole life.

""I've been here 63 years. I've never seen it so bad,"" Schubert said.

He and his son, Eric Schubert, a volunteer firefighter, were heaving an antique Victrola into the back of a pickup. They had moved all of the furniture from the first floor to higher ground.

""This, four hours ago wasn't here,"" Eric Schubert, 27, said, referring to the small lake that had taken over Big Piece. ""By 11 p.m., you won't be able to get out of here without a boat.""

The county has deployed a 5-ton military rig to evacuate residents who refuse to leave. An emergency meeting is scheduled with Sheriff Armando Fontoura at 3:30 p.m. today to plan evacuations.

But longtime residents of Big Piece and the surrounding area have grown stoic about flooding and protective about their embattled homes — not merely from flood damage but from looters.

""If you leave everything you worked so hard to protect, it's guaranteed ruined, "" Zaccaro said.

""I'm staying,"" Markovski said.

Vermont's National Guard began mobilizing helicopters and heavy equipment Tuesday to airlift food, drinking water and other essentials to about a dozen towns cut off by flooding in the wake of Hurricane Irene.

Days after the massive storm cut a treacherous swath across 11 states, hundreds of roads and scores of bridges remained impassable in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. In some cases, those roads and bridges were the sole access routes in and out of rural or coastal communities.

Emergency Management spokesman Mark Bosma said washed-out roads and downed bridges in Vermont have made it necessary to use helicopters to reach towns such as Cavendish, Hancock, Pittsfield, Stockbridge, Strafford and Stratton.

We have a dozen communities that are cut off. We hope to reach them today at least by SUV so we can deliver food and water.

The state also planned to use heavy-duty vehicles to get supplies into other places where roads may be passable. The supplies arrived at National Guard headquarters in Colchester early Tuesday in a convoy of 30 trucks from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

""We have a dozen communities that are cut off,"" said Sue Minter, deputy secretary for the Vermont Agency of Transportation. ""We hope to reach them today at least by SUV so we can deliver food and water.""

Irene has been blamed for at least 40 deaths. More than 2.5 million people from North Carolina to Maine were still without electricity Tuesday, three days after the storm churned up the Eastern Seaboard.

Airlines said it would be days before the thousands of passengers stranded by Irene find their way home. Amtrak service was still out Tuesday between Philadelphia and New York, one of the most heavily traveled parts of the nation's passenger rail system. Some Amtrak trains between New York City and Boston and between Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.

Commuter train service between New Jersey and New York City resumed Tuesday, except for one line that was still dealing with flooding.

Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin said Irene triggered the worst flooding the state has seen in a century as the storm moved north into Canada. At least 260 roads were impassable, and 30 bridges were either down or deemed unsafe.

""We have very expensive and significant damage throughout the state,"" Minter said. She added that temporary bridges would be installed over waterways until the structures could be either repaired or rebuilt.

""We always had that truism that said, `Yup, yah can't get there from here.' In fact, that's come to pass down here,"" said Gloria Cristelli, town clerk in Newfane, Vt. ""There are certain pockets where you can't get there from here, at least not by a car.""

Irene dumped up to 11 inches of rain in some places in Vermont, turning placid mountain streams into roaring brown torrents that smashed buildings and ripped homes from their foundations. At least three people died in the state.

High winds and heavy rain also flooded whole valleys in parts of upstate New York, sweeping away homes and bridges and cutting off access to at least three towns.

Dozens of major highways, including sections of interstates 87 and 90, were closed to traffic. Some bridges had simply given way — including a 156-year-old wooden covered bridge across Schoharie Creek in Blenheim, N.Y.

In North Carolina, where some 1,000 people were still in emergency shelters awaiting word on their homes, officials were trying to get a handle on the extent of the damage to Highway 12. The road links the northern and southern portion of the exposed Outer Banks, the chain of barrier islands that bore the brunt of the storm.

""It's going to take time to fix it and it's going to cost money,"" said Greer Beaty, a spokesperson with the state's Department of Transportation.

""In some locations, we are still working with utilities to move power lines off the road,"" she said, adding that the agency aims to ""gather all our data and make the right decision about how to procede, not necessarily the fastest decision.""

Susan Paul owns The Community Store on remote Ocracoke Island, which is accessible only by boat. She said she chose to ride out the storm on the island, rather than flee to the mainland.

""We fortunately have ferry routes that run to the mainland, and they are re-starting today to let people back to their homes,"" Paul said.

She noted that Highway 12 was closed for nearly a month in 2003 after Hurricane Isabel roared through. But ""in 2003, it was only one spot that was washed out,"" she said. ""This time it's five, so we don't really know how long it will be.""

Irene caused about $7 billion in damage, according an estimate from the Kinetic Analysis Corporation, which advises reinsurers and government policymakers. But the torrential flooding in places such as Vermont may add $1 billion to $2 billion in costs, according to Kinetic CEO Jan Vermeiren.

He said the company uses computer modeling in compiling damage estimates, and that those models have proven to be ""in the ballpark of what it comes out to be in the end.""

Vermeiren estimated that insured losses will be less than $3 billion. He said that's because hardly any private insurers cover flood damage.

14,14,FL-2011-000139-CHN,Floods strand thousands in US after Irene - SKNVibes.com,http://www.sknvibes.com/news/newsdetails.cfm/39815,"(WILMINGTON, USA) - Thousands remained cut off by severe flooding across Vermont, New Jersey and upstate New York Wednesday in the lingering aftermath of Hurricane Irene, which has killed nearly 50 people.

US President Barack Obama signed a declaration that a ""major disaster"" existed in parts of North Carolina and New York, paving the way for federal aid to areas hit by massive flooding and widespread power outages.

Emergency provisions had to be airlifted on Tuesday to dozens of communities stranded by floodwaters as torrential weekend rains dumped by the massive storm system washed away roads and sent rivers cascading over their banks.

Although the much-hyped direct-hit on New York failed to translate into major damage or casualties in America's most populous city, heavy rain in places like the Catskill Mountains proved a ticking disaster time-bomb.

Three days after the storm's passage, marooned families were still waiting anxiously for the national guard and firefighters to bring food and water to towns swamped by the floodwaters.

In other places, rescuers have been ferrying thousands of people -- including the elderly, children and babies -- to safety in rubber motorboats.

The main highway to Wilmington, Vermont was clogged with mud and Irene had turned other roads into deathtrap chasms after dumping two months worth of rain (8.3 inches, 21 centimeters) in less than a day.

""The problem is inaccessibility,"" emergency operations supervisor Dave Miller told AFP as teams struggled to pull trucks out of the sludge and remove fallen trees that had perilously dragged down power lines.

The drastic situation was mirrored in parts of New Jersey and upstate New York, where schools and community centers turned into makeshift Red Cross emergency shelters were nearing full capacity.

In Paterson, New Jersey, teams rescued and evacuated people non-stop on Tuesday under thankfully blue skies after the Passaic River crested 13 feet (four meters) above flood stage, its highest level since 1903.

New Jersey state lawmaker Scott Rumana, touring stricken areas with Governor Chris Christie, said it was ""unquestionably the biggest flooding event in our lifetimes.""

Millions of Americans remained without electricity, many farther south in states like Virginia and North Carolina, where Irene's winds were strongest as the storm barreled up the eastern seaboard on Saturday and Sunday.

Vermont, a mountainous state crisscrossed by numerous streams and rivers, saw several towns completely cut off by the floods.

""There are currently 13 communities that are unreachable by vehicle due to road damage,"" said a statement from Vermont Emergency Management.

""There are more than 200 roads that are still impassable statewide and all 500 road workers from the Agency of Transportation are on the street today working on repairs.""

Dramatic television pictures from New Jersey, New York and Vermont showed flash floods sweeping through towns and fields turned to lakes where rivers had burst their banks.

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack visited Virginia and North Carolina on Tuesday, while top disaster official Craig Fugate went to Burlington, Vermont.

""What I saw in North Carolina was really quite startling and quite significant in terms of agricultural damage,"" Vilsack told a conference call with journalists afterwards.

""Corn fields that were destroyed, cotton fields where cotton was now lying on the ground, damage to soya bean as well as tobacco fields in North Carolina as well as Virginia... significant damage to the tomato industry.""

Research firms have estimated that Irene could cause up to $7 billion in damage, but that does not factor in the longer-term effect on farmers.

Officials have reported at least 43 deaths across 11 states, including eight in New York, seven in New Jersey and six in North Carolina, where Irene made landfall Saturday with winds upwards of 85 miles (140 kilometers) an hour.

The hurricane was already responsible for at least five deaths in the Caribbean before it struck the United States, and is being blamed for a 49th fatality in Canada, where the storm finally petered out on Tuesday.

More trouble was on the way though as Tropical Storm Katia formed in the Atlantic, forecast to become a category 3 hurricane by Saturday or Sunday with winds topping 120 miles per hour.","Tue, 30 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.sknvibes.com/Classifieds/images/noimageavail.jpg,"['vermont', 'floods', 'strand', 'irene', 'thousands', 'jersey', 'damage', 'fields', 'winds', 'storm', 'york', 'carolina', 'north']",

DAEGU, South Korea - Dayron Robles was disqualified from the 110 metres hurdles final at the world championships in Daegu and stripped of his gold medal on Monday after bumping China's Liu Xiang in a physical track tussle.

In the breath-taking final, Robles and Chinese legend Liu Xiang were neighbors in Lane 5 and Lane 6, respectively.

After the starting gun fire, the two world's fastest-ever hurdlers were almost running neck to neck in the first eight hurdles and took the lead.

In the ninth hurdle, however, Robles' right trailing hand was seen hitting on Liu's left hand. As a result, Liu's rhythm was disturbed and his blistering pace slowed down.

Right before the tenth and final hurdle, Robles made further hand contact with Liu, who tripped on the hurdle.

Huge screens at the Daegu stadium repeatedly replayed the two hurdlers' contacts from various angles.

An official with the IAAF told reporters that the Daegu track referee council has decided to disqualify Robbles' mark and it was unknown whether the Cuban team would appeal.

Before the disqualification, Robles won in 13.14 seconds, followed by Jason Richardson from the United States with 13.16 seconds. Liu Xiang finished third in 13.27 seconds.

According to the IAAF rule of 163.2, any competing athlete who jostles or obstructs another athlete, so as to impede his progress, shall be liable to disqualification from that event.

It also says the Referee shall have the authority to order the race to be reheld excluding any disqualified athlete. And yet such a scenario seems to be quite unlikely.

Robles, in a televised interview, admitted that he didn't like his technique in Monday night's game and he was tangling with Liu over the last hurdle.

Liu said he ""felt like someone touched my elbow and I lost my balance for a while but then I managed to recover"".

""It happens all the time in the competitions. But this time, in the final of world championships, it was kind of different. I am OK with everything that happened today and this is a legacy to me. Robles prepared well. I tried my best (and got) no regret,"" Liu said.

A member of Liu's coaching team had told Xinhua right after the game that the Chinese Athletics Association might appeal for the disruption. Meanwhile, Liu told reporters that he didn't care much about the color of the medal.

Daegu on Monday night witnessed the first Championship clash of hurdling's current big three -- Robles, Liu Xiang and 2011's fastest man David Oliver of the United States.

They are also the three fastest-ever men in the history of the event -- Robles, 12.87 seconds, Liu 12.88, Oliver 12.89. The 110m hurdles final tonight was their first meeting in a final at a global championships.

Adding to this hotly-contested final is rising hurdler Richardson. The 25-year-old took an easy and clear win in the semifinals in 13.11 seconds.

Oliver, without a good shape on Monday night, finished fourth in 13.44 seconds, after Robles was disqualified.","Mon, 29 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20110829/00221917dead0fc5e4f410.jpg,"['told', 'hurdle', 'world', '110m', 'liu', 'final', 'stripped', 'robles', 'hurdles', 'daegu', 'xiang', 'gold', 'seconds']",

President Asif Ali Zardari has launched an international appeal to provide assistance for the millions of people affected by this year’s floods triggered by torrential rains in the country.





With the new spell of monsoon in southern Sindh, hundreds of people have lost their lives and over five million have been displaced. According to official data, over four million acres of land has been inundated; 2.5 million acres of crops have been destroyed and over a million houses have been damaged or washed away.The president on Thursday appealed to the international community for humanitarian and rehabilitation assistance. He also requested UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to mobilise the international community for urgently needed relief assistance in wake of the devastation left by the floods.“President Asif Zardari talked to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon by telephone today and requested him to issue an international appeal for assistance to the flood-affected people,” presidential spokesman Farhatullah Babar told AFP. He said Zardari visited his native Nawabshah and other flood-affected towns to review the relief work before speaking from Karachi with the UN chief.A team of UN agencies is currently visiting the affected areas for a needs assessment. Zardari has also appealed to the people of Pakistan, including the expatriate community, to make generous contributions and assist in the rescue, relief and rehabilitation efforts for millions of their compatriots affected by this natural calamity.Chairman National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Zafar Iqbal Qadir had earlier stated that NDMA, PDMA and district authorities, with the support of collaborative partners such as UN and other agencies, would assess the damages first to determine the needs of the victims.Qadir said that Pakistan has the capacity and enough funds to deal with the disaster; however if the magnitude of the disaster is huge, the need to launch an international appeal may arise.With a forecast of more rains, even in areas of Sindh where water is stagnant are expected to face more floods adding to the damage and cost.In the wake of the severity and scale of this natural disaster, urgent humanitarian assistance is required to save lives and continue rescue operations. The most pressing requirements at the moment are for tents, aqua tablets, water purification equipment, food supplies, de-watering pumps and medicines.

18,18,FL-2011-000139-CHN,Vanishing Shangri-La (1) - chinadialogue,https://chinadialogue.net/en/nature/4518-vanishing-shangri-la-1/,"This summer, I went on a journey in search of the “real” Shangri-La, trekking up mountains and crossing rivers to find the spot most worthy of the name given to the mythical Tibetan paradise. Finally, I made it – only to discover that paradise is on its way out.

Starting in Beijing, I flew 2,300 kilometres to Deqen Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in northern Yunnan, south-west China. The county I touched down in used to be called Zhongdian – but it has been re-branded as Shangri-La county by local government in a bid to attract tourists, like an actor taking on a more fashionable stage name. It was not the Shangri-La I was looking for.

Next, a 10-hour bus journey took me along a dusty mountain road, in the throws of being upgraded, across the dry Jinsha River valley, over a cool pass through the Baima Mountains and, finally, to the county of Deqen. This is the northernmost county in Yunnan: go any further and you’re in Tibet.

But I hadn’t reached my destination – there was still a long way to go. Another drive around the side of a mountain, over the Lancang River and two hours later I arrived under the peak of Khawakarpo.

At 6,740 metres, Khawakarpo – described by American explorer Joseph Rock as “the most glorious peak my eyes were ever privileged to see” – is the highest point in Yunnan. It is the major feature of the Meili Snow Mountains, which lie between the Nu and Lancang valleys and have 13 peaks above 6,000 metres, known as the 13 princes. Twenty years ago, a Sino-Japanese group attempting the ascent of Khawakarpo was wiped out by an avalanche, and these mountains remain among the world’s few unclimbed peaks. In 2005, China National Geographic named the range one of China’s 10 most beautiful, and the Meili Lancang valley one of the country’s most picturesque.

Since British author James Hilton described the fictional Shangri-La in his 1933 novel Lost Horizon, many places across the Himalayas have claimed to be the inspiration. The Shangri-La I’m looking for is a small Tibetan village that has been hidden in the folds of Khawakarpo for hundreds of years – Yubeng. Even today, it’s a struggle to get there: a seven or eight hour walk, or four or five on horseback. Climbing the nine kilometres of precipitous mountain path takes you over Nanzong pass and finally to Yubeng, hidden deep in the mountains.

Yubeng was traditionally known as the village hidden in the rocks. In times long past, says local legend, a stranger would visit villages near the mountains every year, asking for grain. He would never say where he came from, and so curious villagers cut a hole in his sack and followed the trail of grain – all the way to a giant rock in the mountainside. When they shifted the rock, they discovered a village hidden within, surrounded on all sides by mountains. This was Yubeng.

But I’m not following a trail of grain, I’m following a trail of rubbish: plastic bags, food wrappers, instant-noodle pots, fodder containers, beer cans – all strewn along the winding path to Yubeng, the Shangri-La of legend.

At the highest point on Nanzong pass, there are several stalls run by Yubeng residents. Behind one of these, I caught a glimpse of something white through the dense trees and went to have a look. What I saw made me gasp: if the rubbish scattered by the road was a guerrilla army, here were massed regiments – plastic rubbish heaped among the trees: a ghastly sight.

Since Yubeng was “discovered” by outsiders more than a decade ago, this isolated village has become a tourist hotspot. But crowds of visitors have brought with them mountains of rubbish. With no road, all goods and refuse have to be moved by horses and porters, and dealing with waste has become a major problem.

Yubeng lies in the Meili Snow Mountains National Park. Until two years ago, the area was managed by the park’s management bureau, which had a system in place – rubbish removal was the responsibility of villagers, who had their names written on bins placed every 50 metres along the road. The villagers were responsible for clearing their area, and then the rubbish would be taken down the mountain on horseback. The park managers had close links with the village and encouraged residents to take care of things themselves. The system worked well, and didn’t cost much.

But in October 2009, the local government ruled that this “national park” would be run by a state-owned tourism company, leaving the park office with neither the funding to operate nor the rights to run as a business. A report from the provincial government’s research office said the national park management office “has seen management functions weakened, is in the awkward position of having nothing to do and is in the process of losing its management functions.”

After the company took over, it spent tens of thousands of yuan employing Yubeng locals to handle the rubbish. But the company wasn’t part of the community in the way the park managers had been and had little contact with the village – and so the villagers took the money and didn’t much bother with the rubbish. If you’re keeping all the entrance ticket money, the villagers thought, you can deal with the rubbish.

It was approaching evening when we arrived at the almost-mythical Yubeng. Before the 1990s, this was a very poor village, but the arrival of tourism has made it one of the richest in the mountains, as locals have earned money from offering horse-rides and opening guesthouses.

I finally realised why people call this the real Shangri-La. Each and every Yubeng doorstep has a view to envy: towering, snow-covered peaks glittering under a pure blue sky. A stroll through never-ending virgin forests takes you to sacred waterfalls, icy lakes, alpine pastures and majestic valleys. Most importantly for the Tibetans, they live in the embrace of the sacred mountain Khawakarpo, near the cave where Guru Rinpoche – believed to have brought Buddhism to Tibet in the eighth century – is said to have meditated. There are 35 households here, with a population of 160, and traditional Tibetan culture has mostly been retained. Almost one third of families are polyandrous (the women have more than one husband).

The village is now full of guesthouses, and several more are being built. One night I stayed at Sacred Waterfall Inn, owned by a man named Aqinbu and his brother. The place is quite big, with more than 20 rooms. A bridge over a small river out front takes you to a wide pasture with forest in the distance. Further off is the beautiful Goddess Peak, but it is so clear it could be right next to the inn.

Passing the house next door I saw the family had just killed a calf. I asked Aqinbu how the locals could kill an animal within sight of the sacred mountains. He fell silent, before explaining: “That’s an outsider; he’ll sell the cow on to one of the innkeepers from Kunming [the provincial capital]. I’ve never killed a cow. The meat for guests is all brought in from outside.”

Aqinbu said those who move here from outside only come for money – they don’t respect local culture and customs, and they bring in bad practices.

More tourists mean more guesthouses. With no highway, there has been no way to bring in building materials from outside, and so trees have been felled. There’s no electricity and wood is burned for cooking, heating and light. Each inn has a boiler needing 500 kilograms of firewood a day – 20 inns use 10,000 kilograms. And so, over the last two years, lots of trees have been chopped down.

The tourists also generate over 50 kilograms of plastic waste a day. But the villagers don’t want to burn it in front of the sacred mountains, and as it can’t readily be taken away, it just piles up.

Management of tourism is also a major issue. In the October national holiday last year, some 500 tourists arrived every day, each staying at least two days – meaning that at any one time, there were 1,000 visitors in the village. There weren’t enough packhorses, there weren’t enough beds, many people couldn’t even get drinking water. During the 2007 May holiday, tourists were washing in sacred waterfalls, hanging their clothes over prayer flags and shouting in loud voices. Then an avalanche killed one and injured another. “If there were stewards, or warning signs, that wouldn’t have happened,” said Aqinbu.

Aqinbu worries for the future of Yubeng: the villagers used to make frequent pilgrimage circuits around the sacred mountains, but they’re doing that a lot less now, preferring to earn money; they used to treat each other like relatives, like brothers, but now some have learned bad business habits from outsiders, competing and undercutting one another. “Give it another five years and we’ll all be enemies,” He said.

He believes better management of tourism is needed, otherwise “this paradise will become another Lijiang”. Lijiang is an old Naxi town not far away which many say has lost its original charms due to excessive commercialisation. The development of Lijiang has been widely criticised.

In fact, Aqinbu’s fears are already becoming reality. The road from the airport to the county will soon be completed, and the five or six hour journey – longer when roadworks are under way – will be cut to less than three. Then, even more tourists will flood into Yubeng.

19,19,FL-2011-000139-CHN,"Irene 'just devastating' in Vermont, governor says - CNN International",http://edition.cnn.com/2011/US/08/29/irene.vermont/index.html,"Brattleboro, Vermont (CNN) -- Floodwaters brought by Tropical Storm Irene began to recede Monday in parts of Vermont, but the governor warned that further flooding and loss of life are likely ahead for the small, rural state.

""It's just devastating,"" Gov. Peter Shumlin said Monday. ""Whole communities under water, businesses, homes, obviously roads and bridges, rail transportation infrastructure. We've lost farmers' crops,"" he said. ""We're tough folks up here but Irene ... really hit us hard.""

Hundreds of people remained trapped Monday in communities cut off by raging floodwaters that washed out or otherwise damaged 263 roads and bridges, Shumlin said. Exactly how many were stranded remained unclear, he said.

""It's hard for us to know, frankly, because it's hard for us to get into the communities we need to get to,"" he said.

Highlighting the transportation problems, the Vermont National Guard had to travel through neighboring Massachusetts to get rescue crews to the small, cut-off town of Wilmington, the governor said.

Three deaths had been confirmed as a result of the storm.

A woman who was standing near the Deerfield River in Wilmington died after she was swept away by floodwaters. Her body was recovered, according to authorities.

Also, a male was killed in Mendon after being swept away by floodwaters, according to Vermont Emergency Management. Another male was found dead in Lake Rescue in Ludlow earlier Monday, authorities said.

Shumlin said Monday afternoon that authorities were searching for another missing person.

Images of the flooding showed normally tranquil streams pouring through city streets and thrashing against buildings and bridges, including some of the state's iconic covered bridges. Four to six of the covered bridges were destroyed in the flooding, officials said.

Even the state emergency management headquarters in Waterbury flooded Sunday night, forcing officials to evacuate to Burlington, about 20 miles away.

""The storm essentially shut southern Vermont down,"" said state police Capt. Ray Keefe. ""It's terrible.""

President Barack Obama signed a disaster declaration for the state on Monday, allowing federal aid to the state.

Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate planned to tour flooded communities in Vermont on Tuesday, according to the Department of Homeland Security. No specifics of Fugate's trip were given.

The governor described conditions as ""probably the toughest flooding that we've seen in the state of Vermont in our history.""

""You've got to remember that Vermont is a lot of beautiful mountains with valleys and small brooks that run into bigger rivers,"" Shumlin said on CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.""

""Our small brooks have crested (but) our larger rivers have not -- so we know there's more trouble ahead.""

Ashley Grote lives in South Royalton, Vermont, along the White River. Her home is on a hill, so the only damages she suffered were a washed-out driveway and a ""small river running through our backyard.""

But many others in the area were not so fortunate, Grote said Monday after taking a walking tour of the area. She saw washed-out roads, farm fields covered in silt and other damage. She said she knows some houses were swept away, as well.

""The massive amounts of damage caused by water is so unbelievable, and until you see it you would not believe it,"" she said. ""There are so many farmers whose fields are beyond repair, and are losing food for their animals or hay that they sell for an income.""

Many areas of the state remained under flood warnings Monday, with the National Weather Service reporting continued record flooding in some locations.

For instance, Otter Creek in Rutland, Vermont, went from a depth of less than 4 feet Sunday morning to more than 17 feet at 1:45 a.m. Monday -- nearly 4 feet higher than the record set in 1938, according to the National Weather Service. While it was falling Monday morning, it was still 8 feet above flood stage.

Shumlin said additional flooding problems were likely as water poured out of smaller streams into larger rivers.

CNN iReporter Andrew Cliver had been through a hurricane before, but he said Vermont's mountainous terrain amplified the effects of Irene's rains.

""Because it's so mountainous here, the water all drains into these little creeks and rivers with a rushing force that's powerful enough to move buildings that have been standing for 100 years,"" he said.

Unlike many states, Vermont did not order or suggest evacuations. Many of the state's towns are in lowlands and there are few large areas of dry land, so large-scale evacuations are impractical, Shumlin said.

Some towns did partially evacuate overnight, including the state capital of Montpelier, but the situation in the town of 8,000 located 50 miles from Canada was not as bad as feared, officials said. Floodwaters appeared to peak on the Winooski River early Monday.

""There does not appear to be much additional flooding from what has been previously reported,"" said City Manager William J. Fraser. ""Overall we do not expect conditions to get worse.""

In Brattleboro, a city of 12,000 people on the New Hampshire border, Whetstone Brook flowed out of its banks and undermined a three-story building, threatening to bring it down.

""We've seen nothing like this,"" said Barbara Sondag, town manager for Brattleboro.

Lifelong resident Jesse Stone watched the White River rip away at the footings of the historic Quechee covered bridge as it washed through the heart of the town.

""It is just about impossible to imagine this bridge being taken out,"" Stone said in an iReport. ""It's usually (far) above the water level.""

The under-construction One World Trade Center stands over the National September 11th Memorial and Museum in New York's Lower Manhattan on August 24, 2011. [Photo/Agencies]

NEW YORK - A decade after the devastating terrorist attacks, ground zero is witnessing life and exuberance coming back. With the opening of the 9/11 Memorial this September and the accompanying Museum in 2012, many cannot help but worry about the safety of the new World Trade Center (WTC) amidst all the redevelopment of lower Manhattan.

Chi Chu, head of Operations Department at Silverstein Properties, the firm responsible for developing the new WTC, assures Xinhua that safety, in this case, is always a top priority.

Chu is referring, in particular, to 7 WTC, the only building currently in use at ground zero. Opened in May of 2006, this 52- story, 1.7 million square-foot skyscraper literally marks the gateway to the new WTC and heralds the spirit of renewal in the neighborhood.

""This is probably the safest building in the world,"" said Chu, who is also the Vice Chairperson of the Real Estate Board of New York's Board of Management Division.

For starters, the structure was designed with ""increased robustness and redundancy of steel,"" according to a Silverstein Properties press kit. ""Even the laminated, structurally fortified wall and columns in the building lobby serve as a blast shield.""

The building is made of two-foot thick reinforced concrete walls protecting the building's core for the full height of the tower, including the lobby, exit stairways, and elevators. When one wall had to be slightly scaled down during construction, ""it took them four days to cut through!"" Chu recalled.

7 WTC is also equipped with an enhanced evacuation system, the most pronounced being the exit stairs. Going above and beyond the New York City Building Codes and Port Authority requirements, these stairs are 20 percent wider.

Furthermore, as these are located within the reinforced concrete core, they permit a more rapid evacuation and allow for easier access by emergency responders. Along the same lines, the four fire stairways were also designed to exit directly to the outside, thereby avoiding possible confusion associated with exiting through the building lobby while still allowing transferring between the stairways.

The cherry on top of the sundae here has to be the emergency lighting and glow-in-the-dark paint equipped in the stairways. On top of their traditional functions, these features are also pressurized and smoke-purged to resist the intrusion of smoke.

Other above-code designs include advanced fireproofing material ten times the adhesiveness and twice the thickness as required by building codes, double the dual standpipes and water storage capacity for building sprinklers, and a fresh air intake system with multiple levels of high performance filters located at the top of the tower.

""It's like a giant panic room,"" Chu said. ""It's really the safest building in the world.""

""Today when I look out and see the buildings coming up, I feel very happy,"" said Chu, who witnessed the collapse of his former office firsthand on September 11, 2001.

""It was like after World War III, the whole area was destroyed. The debris was thick and the whole area was covered with dust. Shoes, pocket books, briefcases were covering entire streets. And there was nobody inside. And it was a very, very sad feeling, a very empty feeling... words cannot describe,"" he said, hesitant to further elaborate on the details.

""I'm very happy to see the change of the whole downtown area,"" he continued after a pause. ""What you really have to see mentally is what I have seen at that time: the darkness, the lifelessness.""

Indeed, nearly ten years after that horrific day, a new World Trade Center is rising from the ashes of the ground zero, and reclaiming its exuberance and life. Many have moved back to lower Manhattan, and the stores, eateries, and hotels nearly doubled in the area, attracting more than 9 million visitors each year.

The new WTC will also consist of 5 skyscrapers (2, 3, 4, 5, and 1 WTC, or the Freedom Tower), the WTC Transportation Hub, a retail complex, and a performing arts center. All of these will be built according to the same above-code standards of sustainable design and safety systems as well.

But the most significant is no doubt the opening of the 9/11 Memorial, with its two massive pools and unprecedentedly large accompanying waterfalls honoring the nearly 3,000 who lost their lives during the tragedy.

""Now, the whole new downtown is rebuilt. It has become a 24-7 community where you have shopping, people living and working here again,"" Chu said. ""The whole area is vibrant, it gives me great joy. This is a complete 180 degree turn.""","Tue, 30 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/images/911/attachement/jpg/site1/20110830/f04da2db14490fc6969108.jpg,"['chu', 'center', 'building', 'trade', 'zero', 'safer', 'emerging', 'stairways', 'wtc', 'area', '911', 'safety', 'world']",

Maybe Hurricane Irene wasn’t overhyped after all: the storm is likely to rank among the 10 costliest catastrophes in U.S. history, according to The New York Times, with a pricetag of $7 billion to $10 billion. Flooding caused much of that damage, which means it won’t be covered by most insurance policies. Insurance companies normally cover half a storm’s costs but in this case they may cover less than 40 percent. Meanwhile, National Guard helicopters are transporting supplies into Vermont towns that have been cut off by the flooding. The town of Pittsfield held a barbecue as it waited.

Man Swept in N.J. Sewer Line KilledAug. 30, 2011 11:35 PM EDT

Police on Tuesday night found the body of a man swept into sewer line by floodwaters earlier in the day. The man’s body reportedly was carried through the sewer pipe for two miles before being washed up at a nearby sewage treatment plant. Police said the man was washed into a manhole cover by floodwaters on his own property, where a landscape supply company, Shemin Nurseries, is located. Meanwhile, rising flood waters on Tuesday onn the Passaic River in New Jersey forced evacuations in Paterson and Wallington. The hurricane season is not over yet: Forecasters said Tuesday that Tropical Storm Katia is likely to become a hurricane by late Wednesday or early Thursday.

FEMA's Disaster Account Dangerously LowAugust 30, 2011 6:35 AM EDT

Hurricane Irene has caused billions of dollars in damage, but it's nothing special this year: It's the 10th natural disaster to rack up over $1 billion in damages in 2011 alone. With less than $800 million in its kitty, FEMA has had to temporarily shelve buliding projects from earlier disasters (going back to Katrina) in order to help. The agency is also facing a shortfall for the next budget year as high as $5 billion, even without including Irene's expenses. Though legislators have been aware of the impending budget problem, the White House has so far declined to ask for more funding. Plus, The Daily Beast's Daniel Stone and Laura Colarusso report on FEMA's budget disaster.

'Hurricane Killer' Found DeadAug. 29, 2011, 6:44 AM EDT

A soldier suspected of killing four people in suburban Philadelphia has been found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities were on the hunt for John Egland, 37, after they suspected him of killing his ex-wife, her boyfriend, the boyfriend’s son, and his former mother-in-law as Hurricane Irene swept the coast. Local residents were asked to lock themselves indoors as two commando teams searched the area, eventually finding his body with the rifle and pistol he had used to fire at police 10 hours earlier. Egland had recently returned from his third deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan.

I am, at the moment, sitting in my suburban–New Jersey home surrounded by $50 worth of candles, $40 worth of canned goods, five flashlights, four dozen batteries, 10 books of matches, enough bottled water to irrigate a small desert, windows plastered with duct tape, and our 5-year-old son dashing around the house wearing a plastic firefighter’s hat and strangely exhorting his bewildered 11-month-old sister to hold her breath. Yet as I sit prepared for what newscasters are still calling the “monster storm of the century,” and President Obama himself proclaimed a “historic hurricane,” the weather event of the century is being downgraded into a run-of-the-mill tropical storm, the rain has stopped, and the sun is out.

Bloomberg: I Made Right CallsAug. 28, 2011, 3:30 PM EDT

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he thinks the city made the right decisions in preparing for Irene. The hurricane is now a tropical storm, and it lost some steam when it hit the city Sunday morning, making landfall in Coney Island. But Bloomberg said it was better to prepare for the worst, justifying his decisions to shut down the subway system and order mandatory evacuations of low-lying areas. He made the comment as reporters were briefly allowed into a city meeting, and the mayor praised city residents, saying they really cooperated.

Authorities Assess Storm Damage in the SouthAug. 28, 2011, 7:40 AM EDT

It's not over yet, but for areas it's passed through Hurricane Irene fell short of the doomsday predictions of record-breaking storm surges in North Carolina and Virginia. But the slowly moving storm still broke flooding records along the East Coast. Irene inflicted scattered damage over a broad area, so the total damage is not yet known. Authorities said teams would be deployed Sunday—particularly to remote areas—to assess the extent of damages. A high number of insurance claims is expected, and experts recommended tips for filing: documentation is particularly important; keep a video or picture inventory of your property; keep receipts for repair estimates and costs that may be reimbursed.","Tue, 30 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT","https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1493060018/articles/2011/08/28/hurricane-irene-path-makes-landfall-in-new-jersey-new-york-braces/hurricane-irene-wrap_h8gtqf","['nj', '2011', 'tropical', 'hurricane', 'irene', 'city', 'damage', 'billion', '28', 'sewer', 'killed', 'storm', 'man', 'line', 'swept']",

Disorganised yet deadly, the leftovers from Tropical Storm Lee spread farther inland on Tuesday, soaking much of the East Coast. Areas still drying out from Irene were hit with more rain while farmers in the Southeast welcomed the wet weather.



Lee spawned tornadoes that damaged hundreds of homes. Roads were flooded, trees uprooted and power was knocked out to hundreds of thousands of people. Winds from the storm had fanned wildfires in Louisiana and Texas, though calmer air on Tuesday was expected to help firefighters. Lee even kicked up tar balls on the Gulf Coast.



At least four people died in the storm.

Lee formed just off the Louisiana coast late last week and gained strength as it lingered in the Gulf for a couple of days. It dumped more than a foot of rain in New Orleans, testing the city's pump system for the first time in years. The storm then trudged across Mississippi and Alabama. By Tuesday, it had collided with a cold front leaving much of the East Coast wet, with unseasonably cool temperatures.



At one point, flood watches and warnings were in effect from northeast Alabama through West Virginia to New England. Heavy rain bands scattered across the central Appalachians and Northeast. The National Weather Service said four to eight inches of rain were possible, with isolated downpours up to 10 inches.



In southeast Louisiana, Red Eubanks used a floor squeegee to clean up his restaurant and bar. His parking lot had been dry - and the headquarters for Livingston Parish sheriff's deputies and their rescue boat - but the nearby Amite River slowly rose and overflowed its banks.

Tropical Storm Lee spawned tornado sightings and alerts from the Louisiana Gulf Coast to the Florida panhandle on Sunday, while widespread flooding caused at least two deaths.

More than a dozen tornado sightings were reported, and tornado warnings were in effect for portions of Baldwin and Mobile counties in southwest Alabama and Greene, Jasper, Perry and Wayne counties in southern Mississippi, according to the National Weather Service.

On Sunday night, the National Hurricane Center said Lee's center was about 55 miles (90 kilometers) west-northwest of McComb, Mississippi and moving east-northeast at 7 mph (11 kph).

Weather officials have not confirmed any tornadoes touching down in the area but are tracking at least three twisters and funnel clouds near Mobile, Alabama, and central Mississippi near Hattiesburg.

Tornado watches stretched from southeast Mississippi, through a dozen counties in southwest Alabama and several more in the Florida Panhandle. Tornado watches also reached into southwest Georgia on Sunday afternoon.

Wet conditions associated with Tropical Storm Lee's landfall appeared to be a factor in an early-morning car wreck in Mobile, Alabama, that killed one man and left several others injured, authorities said.

The single-vehicle crash around 4am local time Sunday killed Dataurius Nurell Parker of Lucedale, Mississippi, and injured four passengers.

Mobile police investigators said none were wearing seat belts and believed wet conditions contributed to Parker losing control of the car and striking a utility pole.

An unidentified juvenile drowned late Sunday afternoon in choppy surf east of Fort Morgan, Alabama.

Baldwin County Sheriff's investigators determined two juveniles were swept out into the surf. The youth's mother attempted a rescue attempt and was caught in the surf herself, according to a press release.

The mother and second juvenile were rescued, but the search for the first youth was suspended on Sunday evening.

On Saturday, authorities said a Texas man drowned when he lost his boogie board in the choppy water off a Galveston beach. His body was recovered about 150 yards from the beach a few hours later.

Numerous tornado warnings were issued in south Mississippi on Sunday as Tropical Storm Lee continued to come ashore.

Rupert Lacy, the emergency management director in coastal Harrison County, said at least five homes were damaged in Saucier. There were no immediate reports of injuries there.

Lacy said a man in Harrison County was taken to a hospital for injuries sustained when lightning traveled through a phone line. He was expected to survive.

Weather officials were assessing the damage reported from another tornado which touched down in the Gulfport, Mississippi area just after midnight on Sunday.



Several people were sent to area hospitals for treatment of minor injuries. Officials described the damage to homes as minor.

'We don't have a total number of homes damaged yet, but a (national) weather service assessment team is coming to check it out,' Mr Lacy said.

Emergency management officials in Mobile County, Alabama, also confirmed a tornado touched down in the southern part of that county early on Sunday morning, downing power lines and trees. No injuries have been reported.

In Mobile on Sunday, sunny skies and brisk winds gave the appearance of calm as the heaviest rains remained to the west.

Response crews are especially attuned to the threat of tornadoes after devastating twisters ravaged northern Alabama on April 27, killing more than 230 people and leveling portions of Tuscaloosa, Concord and Pleasant Grove.

'We know the heavy-duty rain is a little to the west of us, so we're going to see showers and continued flooding in low-lying areas where the ground is already super saturated. But tomorrow there's going to be a shift in the winds that should give us a little relief, and we're really looking forward to it,' Lacy said.

Emergency management officials in Hancock County, Mississippi, also reported a mobile home flipped just before midnight, but no injuries were reported.

In Pascagoula, Mississippi, where residents were evacuated from two low-lying areas late Saturday night, officials said they were ""standing ready"" for flood issues as heavy rain was expected to move through the area Sunday afternoon.

'We've been fortunate enough to remain outside the major rain bands the last 18 to 20 hours, and that's given us an opportunity for our flooded areas to recede a little since yesterday,' Terry Jackson, deputy director of the Jackson County Emergency Management Agency, said Sunday.

The main brunt of the storm's torrential rain was falling further west in Louisiana, particularly in coastal areas and the New Orleans metropolitan area, although there were no signs of major flooding like the devastating 2005 Hurricane Katrina.



Lee's centre crawled ashore in Louisiana before dawn after the vast, soggy storm system spent hours during the weekend hovering in the northernmost Gulf of Mexico.

By today, at least six to ten inches of rain had fallen in some spots along the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts, and the National Weather Service warned there was a threat of extensive flooding and flash floods because of the storm's slow, meandering jog inland.

The drenching rain bands were expected to head northward into the Tennessee Valley later in the week as forecasters warned that 10 to 15 inches of rain were possible along the central Gulf Coast and up to 20 inches in isolated spots.

National Hurricane Center specialist Robbie Berg said the flash flood threat could be more severe as the rains moves from the flatter Gulf region north into the rugged Appalachians.

Closer to the Gulf, the water is 'just going to sit there a couple of days,' he said. 'Up in the Appalachians you get more threat of flash floods - so that's very similar to some of the stuff we saw in Vermont.'

Vermont is still cleaning up and digging out dozens of communities that were damaged and isolated by heavy rain from Hurricane Irene last week that quickly overfilled mountain rivers.

The storm prompted evacuations in bayou towns such as Jean Lafitte. Thousands were without power.

Late on Saturday, lifelong Jean Lafitte resident Brad Zinet was riding out the storm in his mobile home mounted on pilings. He was hoping it wouldn't take on water.

'We got nowhere to go. We're just getting everything put up out of the way and hope for the best,' said the 31-year-old plumber.

'This is a way of life around here,' he added. 'You just do the best you can and ride it out.'

A week after Hurricane Irene caused massive flooding and claimed at least 46 lives as it barreled up the East Coast, President Barack Obama was heading to northern New Jersey later Sunday for a first-hand look at the damage while keeping an eye on Lee.

The President was to visit Paterson, N.J., where the Passaic River swept through the once-booming factory town of 150,000, flooded its downtown and forced hundreds to evacuate.

At 8 a.m. EDT, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Lee's center had come ashore on the Louisiana coast about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Lafayette. Maximum sustained winds were 45 mph (75 kph) as the storm headed to the north at 3 mph (5 kph).

Tropical storm warnings stretched from near the Louisiana-Texas state line to Destin, Fla.

Although Lee's expected to weaken in coming days, the system was expected to unleash heavy rains over a wide area of the central Gulf Coast and then spread that precipitation into the Tennessee Valley, forecasters said.

To the east, coastal businesses were suffering. Alabama beaches that would normally be packed for the Labor Day holiday were largely empty, and rough seas closed the Port of Mobile. Mississippi's coastal casinos, however, were open and reporting brisk business.

In New Orleans, sporadic downpours caused some street flooding Saturday, but pumps were sucking up the water and sending it into Lake Pontchartrain. Officials said the levees were doing their job in the city that is still recovering from the deadly Hurricane Katrina a half decade ago.

New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu warned residents not to let their guard down, saying: 'We're not out of the woods. Don't go to sleep on this storm.'

To the east, coastal Mississippi officials were bracing for the storm to move further into the state. 'We've been getting some pretty good onshore rains,' said Jackson County emergency director Donald Langham.

Harrison County officials said travel on U.S. Highway 90 had become hazardous because winds from Lee have pushed sand from beach onto the eastbound lanes and the rain has created a situation where drivers cannot see the roadway. 'This layer of sand has gotten up on the highway and you can't determine if you're on the road, up on the median or the curb,' said emergency director Rupert Lacy.

Flooding in Hancock County left several roadways impassable, and the rain on parts of Interstate 10 at times has been so heavy that visibility was down to only a few feet.

In Alabama, rough seas forced the closure of the Port of Mobile. Pockets of heavy rain pounded the beaches Saturday, and strong winds whipped up the surf and bowed palm trees. But just a couple miles inland, wind and rain dropped significantly.

Wet and windy conditions hovered over Dauphin Island, a barrier island in the Gulf, but conditions weren't too threatening, Mayor Jeff Collier said. High surf caused some roads to flood, but all were still passable Saturday afternoon.

Precautions were taken to secure anything that could be swept away by wind or waves, and Labor Day concerts and other festivities were canceled. Beaches that would normally be packed were nearly empty.

'The weekend is literally a wash,' Collier said. 'It's really a shame that it happened on a holiday weekend.'

Elsewhere, the National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Katia was trekking across open ocean about 365 miles (587 kilometers) northeast of the Northern Leeward Islands. No coastal watches or warnings were in effect with the storm so far out to sea.

The center said Katia had top sustained winds of 75 mph (121 kph) and was moving at 12 mph (19 kph) with little change in recent hours.

And in the past month, disasters and disturbances have made people aware that it really can happen to them.

When it comes to risks and perils to property, there is a spectrum of coverages that includes both insurance and warranty, with many shades in between. Warranties don't cover disasters, but in their aftermath there's frequently an overlap between insurance and warranty.

Talk about perils! Your editor, while visiting London last month, witnessed the sights and sounds of riots and looting on the streets outside. Days after returning to New York, the office walls shook profusely under the effects of a rare earthquake centered in Virginia. Then last weekend, a hurricane hit the East Coast of the U.S., tearing up the landscape from North Carolina to Vermont. All three left extensive trails of damage, injuries, and fatalities.

Now comes the cleanup. What follows is an overview of some of the repair/replacement coverages that are likely to be accessed by those suffering losses last month, arranged loosely in a spectrum that ranges from the most routine to the most catastrophic.

Blurring the Lines

First, let's begin by saying that there is a clear separation between warranty and insurance. Warranty covers defects while insurance covers damage.

But sometimes the line between them gets a bit blurry. For instance, extended warranties now sometimes cover perils such as drops or spills that have no clear relationship to a manufacturing defect. Some of the same insurance companies backing extended warranties and vehicle service contracts also write homeowner's insurance policies and comprehensive auto insurance policies.

Some vehicle service contracts are routinely bundled with GAP coverage, which insures the owner for the difference between a car's value and the amount left on the loan should there be a total loss. Others are bundled with roadside assistance packages, tire puncture/repair services, or motoring clubs that will answer distress calls from drivers who locked themselves out of their cars.

Whether it's warranty or insurance, there is a spectrum of coverage that begins with the routine and predictable risk of product failure and ends with a federal declaration that a major disaster has occurred. In between are a myriad of warranty and insurance coverages that we can only begin to summarize here. They include:

Warranty Week is by its very name about the warranty end of this spectrum. So let's start there.

You buy a product. It doesn't work. Usually, you make a claim under a product warranty policy, or perhaps under a separately-purchased extended warranty policy. But sometimes, the merchant also has a guarantee or returns policy that allows for refunds or exchanges for numerous reasons, including defects or failures.

Other times, non-warranted products such as clothing or food are covered by an implied warranty of merchantability, which would cover everything from missing pockets to sour milk. But sometimes, a retailer's ""100% satisfaction guarantee"" is invoked when buyers don't like the color or taste of a perfectly good product.

Anything can have a warranty. Puppies can be sold with warranties that they are healthy. Mortgage loans can be sold with warranties and representations that they are not in default. Even the weather can be warranted, in the sense that discounts or damages can be offered if an event is interrupted by storms. After the record-setting 2005 hurricane season, for instance, some meetings and conventions in Florida sought coverage in case the weather turned dangerous and the gathering was cancelled. It didn't guarantee good weather, but it promised a payout if a storm struck.

Accidental Damage

But let's start with something more conventional, like a laptop computer. Your editor once got a call from a homeowner in Alabama who left their laptop on the coffee table in the living room during a hurricane. The tide came in, she retreated to an upstairs room, and the storm surge inundated the ground floor, destroying the laptop. Was that covered by their Circuit City extended warranty? After all, it was accidentally damaged.

There is such a thing as an extended warranty with additional coverages for accidental damage from handling. The key word in that phrase, however, is handling. And the missing word is normal. ADH covers accidents from normal handling -- damage that arises from the normal use of the product as intended by the manufacturer.

If the laptop is dropped from a desk, or if its owner spills a grande caffè mocha into the keyboard, ADH covers that. But if they run it over while backing the car out of the driveway, or if they use it to knock down a wasp's nest from under the eaves, that's careless, reckless, abusive, or willful damage not covered by ADH.

Water Damage Indicator

In the case of water damage, and particularly with mobile phone insurance, there is a massive gray area caused by hot weather. The humidity in the air could be bad enough to cause a failure. And the mere perspiration of a customer could be enough to trigger a liquid contact indicator inside the unit.

Apple Inc., in fact, routinely denies warranty claims on iPhones when the indicator inside it signals exposure to moisture. Some customers have filed suit, asserting that the moisture indicators themselves are defective. But all are faced with the daunting task of proving a negative: that they didn't negligently expose their handset to water. But we're not lawyers. Whether these types of failures should invalidate a claim is something we'll leave to the attorneys who craft the terms and conditions of those product warranty and extended warranty policies.

What we are fairly certain of is that a failure caused by rising water during a storm will not be covered by a warranty, an extended warranty, or an ADH policy. Whether or not it will be covered by insurance is a function of the policy and the location of the loss. But again, we're a warranty publication, so let's leave that discussion to the insurance industry's lawyers.

Electrical Surge Protection

An extended warranty usually provides longer coverage than a product warranty. But sometimes it also provides deeper coverage as well. For instance, the factory warranty included with many electronic devices typically excludes failures caused by lightning strikes, power surges, and blackouts. Again, it's not a defect of the product. It's an accident caused by an external source.

Such a loss could be covered by an extended warranty. If it is, there would be a clause in the terms and conditions that explains the coverage. Sometimes, it requires that a surge protector also be in use -- in other words the protector failed to protect. Other times, there could be an overlap in coverage between the service contract and the homeowner's insurance policy. In those cases, sometimes the extended warranty will pay the deductible if the rest of the loss is covered by insurance.

An extended warranty also could provide for the replacement of food spoiled during the failure of a refrigerator, for whatever reason. Other times, the spoilage would be covered only if it's caused by an internal defect, rather than by an external source such as a power failure. It all depends on the terms and conditions of the policy.

A home warranty wouldn't ordinarily cover the damage caused by a disaster such as a flood. But it could be used as a convenient way to find a plumber or electrician able to repair or replace appliances at the owner's expense. Most of the servicers contracted by the home warranty administrators are more than willing to take on out-of-warranty work. And of course, any replacement appliances or heating/cooling systems would be covered by a new product warranty, issued by the manufacturer. And the seller might also offer an extended warranty for the new appliances or heating/cooling system.

Repairing Defects

The product warranty, also called the manufacturer's warranty or the factory warranty, is the written guarantee given to the first buyer. Yes, sometimes it's transferable to a subsequent buyer and sometimes with items such as car batteries it's issued by the retailer or dealer rather than by the manufacturer. Some retailers offer longer warranties on electronics and absorb the cost themselves. Others use their ""satisfaction guarantee"" policies as a proxy for longer warranties. But no matter how a warranty is defined, its coverage is usually restricted to just the repair of a defect or the replacement of a clunker.

Where warranty comes into play with disasters is mainly in the area of fraud. First, there is fraud regarding the cause of a failure. ""The screen wasn't cracked by an earthquake. I don't know how it happened.""

Claims adjudicators will have to ask themselves whether they want the customer's continuing goodwill, or if they should stick to the terms and conditions. Everyone's heard the legend of the Neiman Marcus manager who took back tires he didn't sell, simply to keep a loyal customer happy. But goodwill gets expensive, especially after a disaster strikes.

Second, there are attempts to cover-up the damage, such as when a car is flooded, written-off, salvaged, retitled, and resold in another state as ""barely used but never damaged."" It happened along the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and it's sure to happen again now along the East Coast after Hurricane Irene.

In fact, while alert dealers and buyers were on the lookout six years ago for retitled wrecks from Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, they may not be so suspicious this time if the vehicle was titled in the Catskill Mountains or Vermont. Beware of bargains, and beware of sellers who won't allow a buyer's mechanic to look under the hood.

Beware the Storm-Chasers

And third, there are the so-called storm chasers -- the contractors willing to repair a roof or a roadway for a low price, promising warranties that turn out to be worthless. Some may require 100% payment up-front for a job they never intend to start, let alone finish. Some may just take a down payment for the work, or to buy the materials, and then they disappear.

In the recent disasters, the repairs will involve everything from bridges and shopping malls to basements and artificial surfaces on soccer fields. Warranted building products such as carpets, windows, shingles, doors will be in high demand. And let's not forget that the Chinese drywall problem arose after hurricane repairs caused a shortage of domestic sheetrock.

The customers promised warranties for those repairs will include municipalities, businesses and consumers. But even in good weather, we constantly hear about the driveway resurfacing scams or the home remodeling scams, where the contractor disappears or changes the name of their business to avoid later claims for their shoddy or incomplete work.

The best advice we can offer is to know your contractor -- know where they live (ask to see their drivers license) and work (get their business card), know their reputation (search the Better Business Bureau), know that they have all the right insurance coverages (liability and worker compensation certificates) and that their warranties come in writing (ask to read them). And don't ever buy disaster recovery services from a door-to-door salesman who was ""just passing by.""

Implied Warranties

In the absence of a written warranty, there still may be protections available to a victim of fraud. In the case of a used car, for instance, even an ""as-is"" sale by a dealer may be covered in certain states by an implied warranty of fitness for a particular use. That would mean it works, that it can start, move, stop, turn, climb a hill, and all the other things a car is supposed to do. And, in some states, that would also mean it wasn't flood-damaged. But the same protections might not apply to a private ""as-is"" sale of a used car, a boat, or an existing home.

But this is where things get a bit tricky. A claim under an implied warranty is likely to take the form of a lawsuit. In fact, about the only time an implied warranty comes into play is in a case where there was no written warranty, such as with food, apparel, medicine, and services. Glass in your hamburger? That's a lawsuit. Water in your gasoline? That's a lawsuit. Sick from smoking? That's a lawsuit.

And then there are the requirements to disclose. With cars, a dealer might be required to disclose that a vehicle is flood-damaged. But many times these salvaged vehicles are sold across state lines and title passes through multiple pairs of hands, some of whom may not know (or want to know) the vehicle's history. With homes, the seller might be required to disclose flood damage, mold problems, asbestos, radon, mercury or other hazards. But the rules vary from state to state. And the rules for commercial property or multiple dwelling buildings may differ from the rules for single family homes or mobile homes.

And here's where we cross over into insurance. Warranty covers defects. Insurance covers perils. No warranty would cover a stolen or mislaid laptop. Insurance might. No warranty would cover damage from a flood or an earthquake. Insurance might. No warranty would cover a car destroyed by arson or a falling tree. Insurance might.

Property & Casualty Insurance

In the broadest sense, what we're talking about here is property and casualty insurance. Some insurance companies place extended warranty underwriting under that heading. Others call that specialty insurance. We won't get bogged down in the definitions, however. After all, this isn't an insurance newsletter.

With a boat, of course, high wind and rough water are well-known perils. And the hurricane last week didn't disappoint. According to the Boat Owners Association of the U.S., the total damage to recreational boats from South Carolina to Maine could total up to $500 million. And what's surprising is that most of the damage wasn't along the coast. It was in lakes and rivers.

The association, which also sells insurance, said over a thousand of its policyholders took advantage of a policy feature that helps defray the cost to remove a boat from the water before a storm. And indeed, after the storm passed, it reported 500 boats removed in Oregon Inlet NC and only two wrecks, as opposed to only 50 removals in New Bedford MA and 15 wrecks.

New boats typically have factory warranties and are eligible for service contracts as well. But neither would come into play here. A weather event such as this might expose defects in the on-board systems, but the proximate cause of the damage would be the wind and the water. Losses would have to be covered by insurance. The repairs and replacements, however, would receive their own warranties.

With an automobile in the U.S., there are three major types of coverage. Liability insurance covers injuries and damage which a given driver causes. Collision covers damage to your own vehicle in an accident, no matter who's at fault. And comprehensive covers damage from weather, fire, theft, vandalism, and other perils.

Service Contracts & GAP Insurance

When a car purchase is financed, the lender usually requires all three. The dealer sometimes suggests also adding in a vehicle service contract and perhaps GAP coverage, but these are not required.

However, there have been instances when the buyer was wrongly told an extended warranty was a requirement of the loan, and its cost could be bundled into the loan payments. And one can see how easy it would be to position an extended warranty as part of that spectrum of coverage: it's comprehensive insurance for mechanical breakdowns. But still, extended warranties are not required by the bank, while comprehensive and collision coverage usually is.

During the riots in London last month, cars were burned, windows were broken, and inventory was stolen. Comprehensive insurance might cover this, or it might not. It all depends upon the determination of the cause. If two people do it, it's vandalism. If 200 people do it, it's a rampage. If 20,000 people do it, it's a rebellion. And if two million people do it, it's a civil war.

Property and casualty insurance policies and comprehensive automobile policies sometimes exclude damage or loss caused by war, rebellion or civil unrest. Other times, they allow claims caused by small local riots, but only if the damage is reported quickly. But a lot depends upon the definitions and exclusions included in the policy. And the law governing anarchy in the UK is not the same as the law in other countries.

Acts of War

In some instances, the damage might indeed be caused by an organized group -- one man's definition of looters, hooligans, or gangs might be another's definition for terrorists, extremists, or rebels. For instance, most people would call the September 11 attacks an act of war -- indeed, the response to it was branded as the War on Terror. But many insurance policies contain clauses that would specifically exclude such losses, if caused by war or military action.

And so, for that reason, there are now separate policies sold that specifically cover acts of terrorism or acts of war. Some even cover the specific use of weapons of mass destruction. We hope the world never comes to that. But one would expect that many merchants in London will from now on look for insurance that specifically covers vandalism and looting.

Also, insurance would not typically cover the cost of a simple loss of use, unless that were written into the policy. For instance, many businesses that were not damaged by the riots in London could not reopen for days, because of the cleanup. Others were open, but customers stayed away in fear. At one unscathed children's theater, for instance, there was a rash of cancellations on the nights after the riots ended. At one golf shop located far from the actual riots, the owner kept plywood over his windows and doors for nearly a full week, which cut into his business tremendously.

Right now in the Northeast U.S., there are Main Streets all over that are extensively flood-damaged, and countless basements full of inventory that will never dry out. Some businesses are still closed. Others are open, but the customers aren't coming. For instance, some people won't eat at restaurants in areas that lost power during last week's hurricane, for fear they might be served spoiled food. These losses would have to be covered by some type of business interruption insurance.

Replacement Cost

With household appliances, assuming that perils such as floods and storms are covered by a homeowner's insurance policy, there's a further consideration of how well they're covered. Are they insured for their replacement cost? Or are they insured at their current, deeply depreciated value as a used item? That's going to impact the budget for new appliances significantly.

However, most homeowner's policies specifically exclude losses caused by earthquakes, rising water, and wind storms. Or the policies might specifically cover such perils, for an additional premium and with additional deductibles. In the U.S., properties in locations defined to be flood-prone are eligible for the National Flood Insurance Program. But because flood losses are expected in these locations, the premium may be high. And therefore many people choose to go without.

The same goes for earthquake insurance in California and Nevada, or hurricane insurance in Florida. Sure, people know they need it, based on the likelihood of a loss in such locations. But some can't afford to pay $100 a month or more in additional premiums, just for these coverages. So what happens if they go uninsured and lose everything?

The Hundred-Year Storm

Last month, however, part of the tragedy was how unexpected the calamities were in those locations. The August 23 earthquake was the biggest to hit Virginia since 1897. Hurricane Irene was the first to make landfall in New Jersey since 1903. And the worst damage was in even more unexpected places. Flood damage to beachfront property is one thing. But Brattleboro, Vermont?

And that's where the last step in our spectrum of coverages comes into play. When a major disaster strikes, people typically look to the government for help. And once the governor of a given state requests it, the federal government is able to make a formal disaster declaration that makes available a whole new set of assistance, loans, reimbursements and grants to individuals, households, and state and local governments. In extreme cases, the government will buy a home, demolish the damaged structure, and keep the land. The seller is then free to use the cash to move elsewhere.

Just in August 2011, Major Disaster Declarations were made in New York, New Jersey, Utah, Missouri, Nebraska, Louisiana, Iowa, Puerto Rico, and North Carolina, for a list of perils that included flooding, tornadoes, severe storms and hurricanes. Vermont was added to the list earlier today.

Expecting the Unexpected

As with accidental damage from handling, the insurance companies are willing to cover the routine and normal perils: crashed cars, house fires, building collapses, etc. But when it comes to the rare and abnormal events, particularly weather-related disasters, they look to the insurer of last resort: the government. And that's now becoming a political issue. Should the uninsured be bailed out by the taxpayers? Or is there a moral hazard to helping the helpless in their hour of need?

This discussion is far from over. Comments are welcome and will be added to the online edition of this newsletter.

A year after it was hit by flash floods, Druk Padma School, popular as Rancho's school after Aamir Khan's character in the film, has come back to life.The flash floods and mudslides had devastated a wide swath around Leh and caused huge loss to the school, 15 km from Leh and located in Shey, the ancient capital of Ladakh.But after support from different parts of the country and the world, the school is back in action and now is home to about 270 children, 67 of whom are from the flood-affected areas.""This school is meant to educate the deprived children of this region. We also provide hostel facilities for students. Besides, the school organises free medical camps for the people of Ladakh,"" said Prasad Eledath, the school Principal.""It is our endeavour to provide world class education to the kids. The students here study Bothi (the local language), English, and Hindi as well as science, creative arts, and sports,"" he said.Besides, the students also learn skills, including team work, presentation skills through formal and co-curricular activities, he said, adding that by next year he would like to upgrade the school to Class X.""Inspired by the vision of His Holiness the 12th Gyalwang Drukpa, spiritual leader of Ladakh, the school aims to provide modern education for Ladakhi children - an education grounded in their own culture and which could prepare them to lead happy and productive lives,"" Prasad said.Hostel facilities allow children from Ladakh's interior areas to attend the school and a programme of sponsorship makes sure the poorest are not excluded. It is managed by the Druk Pema Karpo Educational Society and funded by international aid.Aamir Khan had some words of praise for the school when he visited there in 2008. ""What a wonderful school. The kids seem very happy, and such a great location. Keep up the good work. Regards, Aamir,"" he wrote in the visitor's diary of the school. But the devastation last year left the students disturbed.Prasad, who had done Masters' of Education from University of Sussex in UK, had turned down lucrative job offers to do something for the people of Ladakh.""It is not a sacrifice. It's more about this being a challenging task.

The conditions are difficult and the region was devastated due to flash floods last year... we could not remain mute spectators to their miseries,"" Lee said.Lee said the Indian Army had been more than helpful in their rehabilitation work.She said the NGO seeks to set up medical clinics in the interior areas of Jammu and Kashmir and provide employment to the youth of the state.

""There's so much talent in the state but it is not being utilised properly. We intend to do that and hope the state government would extend its cooperation to us,"" Lee said, adding their love for India and the beauty of the state had forced them to work for the people of Ladakh.","Mon, 29 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.ndtvimg.com/mt/2011-08/LEH-Floods-295x200_leh.jpg,"['students', 'floods', 'world', 'work', 'leh', 'ladakh', 'children', 'flash', 'school', 'provide', 'education', 'ranchos', 'life']",

The machine is busily warping 400 yards of fabric a minute which is about half of its potential speed.

Phillip Bryan and his band of 32 northwest Georgians are running as fast as they can to stay ahead of the Chinese flood.

For years, the textile producers have tried producing and selling every new product line they could think of, staying one step ahead of overseas competitors who mass produce fabrics at lower cost than American companies.

Southern Industrial Fabrics, Bryan's Rossville-based textile mill, constantly changes what it produces, bouncing among products such as outdoor furniture fabrics, recycled rubber floor mats and air filters that act like vacuum bags for smokestacks.

""We don't shy away from anything,"" Bryan said. ""We do a little bit of everything, and what we did last year we're probably not doing this year.""

Opening new markets seems to be the key to staying alive in the textile business. Almost all of America's clothing and footwear is imported - about 40 percent comes from China. Vietnam holds the second largest share with about 7 percent of textile imports.

Southern Industrial workers stand in front of booming machines, watching them pull threads and weave cloth faster than the untrained eye can follow.

Jesse Paylor assists with the warper machine at Southern Industrial Fabrics in Rossville on Thursday. The machine can warp approximately 800 yards of thread per minute at full speed.

Most of them have been there for decades, and some joke they know more about their work than they do their own families.

That knowledge helps them adapt to the company's constantly changing products.

That ability to stay ahead of foreign producers, whose costs are held down by government subsidies, cheap labor and low-rate loans, is what keeps the group employed, Bryan said. Other textile mills across Tennessee and Georgia laid off more than 60 percent of their workers over the past decade, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Longtime Employees

""It's kind of like home - everybody's family,"" said Nelda Alexander, who's spent 24 years running practically every machine in the mill at one time or another. ""We've all turned gray together.""

Alexander doesn't love her work. Her knee has started acting up, not while she's standing in front of her machine all day, but when she sits down at night. Still, the work is something to do and pays the bills, so she figures she'll do it long after she hits retirement age in five years.

""I like to stay busy, and there's only so much you can do when you don't work,"" she said. ""I'll be here till I die or this place goes under.""

She has a work record lending some credence to that claim. A couple of years back, she bought a Kings & Queens $5 scratch ticket on a lunch break that won her $400,000. After her break, she went back and finished her shift.

""A lot of people say, 'Well, I'd quit work,' but this job is my life,"" she said. ""I paid off everything and put the rest in the bank.""

A large sum for an individual, Alexander's lottery winnings wouldn't cover the cost of the $500,000 machine she works on. The average machine at Southern Industrial costs between $50,000 and $100,000. With 40 in operation, it's easy to see how low-cost loans and government subsidies help foreign textile operations.

To compete, the Rossville mill finds other ways to save money. Thirty-seven-year-old Billy Joe ""Turkey"" Taylor Jr. has worked at Southern Industrial his whole life, following in his father and grandfather's footsteps. Growing up around the machines, he's learned how to repair most everything - air conditioning, looms, plumbing, weavers - saving the factory money and time that would have been spent waiting on an outside repair man.

""From the floor to the ceiling, that's your job,"" he yelled over the constant throbbing of the machines, the factory heartbeat he's responsible for keeping alive. ""If it breaks, you fix it.""

Protection in Law

But only so much money can be saved in staffing, which accounts for about 6 percent of annual costs. Raw materials cover the majority of expenses at the mill, which typically generates from $7 million to $12 million a year in revenues.

The biggest customer for American textile production is the military, whose contracts require goods come from the U.S. to ensure supply lines aren't severed during wartime. Most all of the rest of domestic orders go to companies like Southern Industrial that stay technologically ahead of the foreign mass producers.

Recently, the company has tried its hand at environmentally friendly fabrics. Recyclable materials such as plastic bottles are shredded, palletized and produced into cloth used mainly as shopping bags.

Phillip Bryan explains how a knitting machine works at Southern Industrial Fabrics in Rossville on Thursday. The machine is used to knit polyester (as photographed) along with a variety of other materials.

""It's ecologically efficient, but it's expensive,"" Bryan said. ""You've got to find the product that people will pay for.""

That search isn't easy. When trying out any new product, green or otherwise, Southern Industrial has to go through a hit-or-miss, research-and-development process to manufacture samples, working closely with end-product producers to find the exact fabric for the product they're trying to create.

That process has its costs. The company recently spent $10,000 developing just one of them.

""Ninety-nine percent of this is scrapped,"" Bryan said, picking up a swatch of colorful fabric samples as he walked across the factory floor. Southern Industrial will often get close to the needed product, but customers always seem to have just one more little change they want to make.

But to keep his machines running, his staff working and the company thriving, Bryan will keep developing.

""We'll keep coming up with the next new thing to keep us moving,"" he said. ""What it's going to be, I don't know.""","Sat, 10 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.timesfreepress.com/img/news/tease/2011/09/09/082711cFabrics005_t1070_h9b18d31c2f6788b99ca25a1842c510c02b2e061c.JPG,"['specialty', 'machine', 'stay', 'rossville', 'company', 'textile', 'bryan', 'industrial', 'work', 'niches', 'finds', 'product', 'southern', 'fabrics']",

LONDON - Manchester United and Manchester City left their tortured opponents and the English Premier League in no doubt they are the teams to beat this season after hugely confident demolitions of Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday.

Champions United battered a depleted Arsenal 8-2 at home thanks in part to a Wayne Rooney hat-trick and City striker Edin Dzeko scored four in their 5-1 away rout of a shell-shocked Spurs.

Danny Welbeck, Ashley Young, Nani and Park Ji-sung were also on the scoresheet at Old Trafford with Arsenal netting through Theo Walcott and Robin van Persie before Carl Jenkinson was sent off in a remarkable game.

The Manchester duo stormed to the top of the table with their third wins out of three after rivals Chelsea and Liverpool, now two points back, had hit the summit on Saturday.

Ms. Hayworth issued a statement last week intended to assure her constituents that she did not support the effort to make disaster aid contingent on spending cuts.

“My priority in the coming weeks will be to see that the Hudson Valley has all the federal resources necessary to recover from Hurricane Irene,” she said. “I simply won’t let politics get in the way of doing the right thing for our families and communities that have been affected by the disaster.”

Last week, Mr. Cantor, the majority leader, said that any money the federal government spends to assist storm-damaged areas should be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget.

“Yes, we are going to find the money,” Mr. Cantor said in an interview with Fox News, referring to disaster aid. “We are just going to have to make sure there are savings elsewhere to continue to do so.”

“Just like any family would operate when it’s struck with disaster, it finds the money to take care of a sick loved one or what have you, and then goes without trying to buy a new car or an addition onto the house,” he added.

NEW YORK - Tiger Woods said on Monday that he would play in the PGA Tour's Frys.com Open in October to justify his early selection by United States captain Fred Couples for the Presidents Cup.

Last week, Couples said Woods would be one of his two wildcard picks for the Nov 17-20 team competition in Australia, though he had urged the rusty former world number one to compete in at least one more event before then.

Woods, who had no chance of gaining automatic Cup selection after struggling for form and fitness this season, had previously said his next tournament would be the Nov 10-13 Australian Open.

""I always enjoy competing in my home state (California), and this tournament fits my schedule perfectly,"" Woods said on his website. ""I'm looking forward to seeing some old friends.

""It's been a long time between the PGA (Championship) and Frys, and I'll be anxious to compete.""

The Frys.com Open will be held from Oct 6-9 at CordeValle Golf Club in San Martin, California.

It will be Woods's first appearance on the PGA Tour since the Aug 11-14 PGA Championship at Atlanta Athletic Club where he missed the cut and failed to qualify for the circuit's elite FedExCup playoffs.

Woods, a 14-times major champion, has been a shadow of his former dominant self since the end of 2009 while trying to rebuild his golf swing and private life following the breakup of his marriage.

His world ranking has slipped to 38th and he has not won a tournament since the 2009 Australian Masters.","Wed, 31 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20110831/0022190dec450fc8379e53.jpg,"['pga', 'play', 'series', 'event', 'golf', 'club', 'championship', 'woods', 'commits', 'fall', 'tournament', 'selection', 'tour', 'world']",

TOKYO - A runoff has been kicked off between Japan's industry minister Banri Kaieda and finance minister Yoshihiko Noda in the presidential election of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) on Monday.

Kaieda led the first round of competition with 143 votes, while Noda came in second with 102 votes.

Kaieda, Noda and former foreign minister Seiji Maehara, agriculture, forestry and fisheries minister Michihiko Kano, and transport minister Sumio Mabuchi, are among the five candidates vying for the top post to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Naoto Kan.

Kan resigned Friday as the head of the party after the passage of two bills. Kan said he would resign as Japan's prime minister after the next chief of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) was elected.

A total of 398 DPJ lawmakers voted in the first round after the final presentations by the candidates starting from 11 am, but the candidate must garner a 200-vote majority for a victory.

The winner of the runoff on Monday will become the sixth prime minister in five years.","Mon, 29 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20110829/0013729e48090fc568e211.jpg,"['democratic', 'ruling', 'leader', 'japans', 'kaieda', 'dpj', 'noda', 'prime', 'minister', 'japan', 'playing', 'party']",

DAEGU, South Korea - Russia's Olga Kaniskina grimaced her way through downtown Daegu to win the women's 20 kilometres walk title at the world championships for a record third time.

China's Liu Hong took the silver medal ahead of another Russian, Anisya Kirdyapkina, in third.

Kaniskina, who eclipsed compatriot Olimpiada Ivanova's mark with her third title, crossed the line in a time of 1:29.42, eight seconds ahead of Liu.

Kaniskina's win also put an end to Daegu's ""curse of the covers"", where the official programme's cover stars on each of the previous four days suffered ignominious exits.

Defending pole vault champion Steve Hooker exited without completing a successful jump, Usain Bolt was disqualified from the 100m final, Cuba's Dayron Robles was stripped of gold for bumping in the 110m hurdles and on Tuesday pole vault queen Yelena Isinbayeva failed to clear 4.80.

""Thankfully no one told me about this before the race, they only told me after,"" Kaniskina laughed at a news conference. ""I didn't know about it, but it was a good decision to put me on the cover.""

World record holder Vera Sokolova had looked strong at the head of the field but at the hour mark started to suffer and dropped back to finish in 12th place.

With her tortured face slowly relaxing into relief, Kaniskina thrust her arms into the air to celebrate a third consecutive title as legs like bendy straws dragged her over the line.

Kaniskina, also the gold medallist from the 2008 Beijing Olympics, said the conditions were tough in South Korea.

""Compared to Osaka and Berlin this race was very difficult. We were prepared for the hot and humid weather but not for the sun,"" she added.

""The plan was to go with the group for the first half and then to come out fast. But until the very end of the race I was not sure about my victory.

The need of the hour is to have a pertinent flood forecasting and management strategy of water resources for minimising the ravaging effects of the floods.

Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Mahfooz Elahi in a statement said that Government should accelerate its efforts for setting up new water reservoirs and dams on an urgent basis as deluge hit a number of southern districts of Sindh while the memories of devastating floods of 2010 are still fresh. He said that the outreach of the disaster management system needs to be spread further and made more effective as its current performance was much below the desired level.

There should be a coordinating cell in every affected locality to make relief efforts well integrated and target oriented, he added. ICCI President said that it was high time for Government to invest in dams and construct large water reservoirs to save water from being wasted. He said that the agricultural and economic future of Pakistan would be difficult unless we build more dams. He was reacting to the reports that many dams and other water control infrastructure damaged by last year’s floods have not yet been repaired. He opined that the country is bracing for another natural disaster in the form of heavy rains, therefore government should prioritise support for early recovery programmes that help flood victims. ICCI President said that Pakistan constantly received floods every year but damage could be minimised if Government constricts dams and water reservoirs which are the best instruments for flood control.","Wed, 07 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://archive.pakistantoday.com.pk/wp-content/themes/focus/assets/img/favicon.ico,"['flood', 'floods', 'pakistan', 'management', 'infrastructure', 'prevent', 'reservoirs', 'floodsicci', 'dams', 'solution', 'water', 'icci', 'construction', 'president']",

DAEGU, South Korea - Ethiopian double world record holder and Olympic champion Kenenisa Bekele will not defend his 5,000 metres world title due to injury, his management company said on Wednesday.

Bekele failed to finish the 10,000 metres at the Daegu world championships on Sunday in his first race for more than a year.

He is now back in Ethiopia and has begun his preparations for the 2012 London Olympics.

""Obviously, after my 10,000 it is a little bit too soon to run the 5,000,"" Bekele said in a statement. The first round of the 5,000 is scheduled for Thursday.

It stood tall among beachfront homes - a massive cottage in Nags Head, North Carolina, that rose from the Roanoke Sound where Billy Stinson and his family have been going to nearly 50 years.



But in the blink of an eye, it was gone, swept away by the wrath of Hurricane Irene.

The Stinson family's devastation has been shown in several photographs of the disaster, a father comforting his wife and daughter on the steps leading to where their house once stood, staring at the ocean beyond.

His daughter, Erin Stinson said: 'We were pretending, just for a moment, that the cottage was still behind us and we were just sitting there watching the sunset.'

The cottage, which was built in 1903, was bought by Billy Stinson's family in 1963.

Since then, it was where the retired art teacher spent his vacations, wooed his wife Sandra, and gathered with family, according to OurState.com in an article written a year ago that recounts the cottage and its rich history.

Whole neighbourhoods lay submerged underwater and millions were without power in Hurricane Irene's wake last night as the storm moved north.

Rivers and creeks turned into raging torrents tumbling with tree limbs and parts of buildings in northern New England and upstate New York as the storm's winds diminished, but the torrential rains refused to let up.

Late last night, the storm continued to batter Vermont with heavy rains forcing hundreds of evacuations.



'This is not over,' President Barack Obama said from the White House. 'Many Americans are still at serious risk of power outages and flooding, which could get worse in the coming days as rivers swell past their banks.'

Up and down the coast, the images were the same: Siding peeled from houses; boats torn from moorings and thrown ashore, massive trees ripped from the ground and cars submerged beneath flood waters.

Flooding was widespread in Vermont, where parts of Brattleboro, Bennington and several other communities, were submerged. One woman was swept away and feared drowned in the Deerfield River.

'It's very serious for us at the moment in Vermont. The top two-thirds of the state are inundated with rapidly rising waters, which we anticipate will be an issue for the next 24 hours,' said Robert Stirewalt, a spokesman for Vermont Emergency Management Agency.

Hundreds of Vermonters were told to leave their homes after Irene dumped several inches of rain on the landlocked state.

Video posted on Facebook showed a 141-year-old covered bridge in Rockingham swept away by the roiling, muddy Williams River. In another video, an empty car somersaulted down a river in Bennington.

'It's pretty fierce. I've never seen anything like it,' said Michelle Guevin, who spoke from a Brattleboro restaurant after leaving her home in nearby Newfane. She said the fast-moving Rock River was washing out the road to her house.





The high flood waters seemed to come as a surprise to a state where evacuations had not been made.

'We didn't know where the storm was going to hit,' Mark Bosma of the state's emergency agency said as floodwaters lapped around the command centre. 'Evacuations beforehand just weren't possible.'

At least 32 people died in the storm across the country, most of them when trees crashed through roofs or onto cars.

Rivers and streams yesterday swelled until they burst their banks in upstate New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts.



Last night, flood waters were rising across New Jersey, closing side streets and major highways including the New Jersey Turnpike and Interstate 295.

In the Connecticut town of Prospect, 89-year-old Charlotte Levine was killed early Sunday when a falling tree limb pulled power lines onto her home and started a fire.



The torrential rain chased hundreds of people in upstate New York from their homes and washed out 137 miles of the state's main highway.

Downtown Windham, New York, was 'wiped out' by flooding, with four feet of water rushing through the main street, said Michael Scarey, the town's fire chief.

In Massachusetts, the National Guard had to help people evacuate. The ski resort town of Wilmington, Vermont, was flooded, but nobody could get to it because both state roads leading there were underwater.



'This is the worst I've ever seen in Vermont,' said Mike O'Neil, the state emergency management director.

Captain Ray Keefe of Vermont State Police described the flooding as 'epic.'

'I've never seen flooding like this, especially this widespread,' he said. 'We've lost a lot of homes. Hundreds of roads, bridges have been washed away. This has been a real tough one.'

Rivers roared in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In the Hudson Valley town of New Paltz, New York, so many people were gathering to watch a rising river that authorities banned alcohol sales and ordered people inside.

And in Rhode Island, which has a geography thick with bays, inlets and shoreline, authorities were worried about coastal flooding at evening high tide.



The entire Northeast has been drenched this summer with what has seemed like relentless rain, saturating the ground and raising the risk of flooding, even after the storm passes altogether.

The storm system also knocked out power for millions of people along the Eastern Seaboard and on Sunday night, electricity companies warned it could take weeks to restore power.

The lights went out for more than seven million people and businesses from Folly Beach, South Carolina, to Portland, Maine. And thousands of utility workers have begun the race to restore power.



Getting the lights back on will be an enormous job for crews fanning across the East Coast.



Irene ripped down power lines and crushed critical equipment near power plants.

It flooded coastal cities with seawater, dousing electrical stations and threatening underground wires. Crews are still assessing the damage.



'We're dark across the whole map,' said Theresa Gilbert of Connecticut Light & Power. Irene blacked out half of the utility's 1.2 million customers on Sunday, making it the biggest outage in Connecticut history.

More than five million people and businesses remain without power, and the storm had led to the deaths of at least 20 people in eight states by Sunday evening.



Some areas in its path, like Manhattan, were relatively unscathed by the weekend storm, while other areas will need days, or even weeks, to recover.



In the hardest-hit areas, pockets of about 20 homes were destroyed.



For many, though, the storm was more inconvenience than calamity.



In Ocean City, Maryland, Charlie Koetzle ignored evacuation orders and went to the boardwalk before dawn in his swim trunks and flip-flops, saying he always wanted to see a hurricane.



Asked about damage, he mentioned a sign that blew down, the Associated Press reports.



'The beach is still here, and there is lots of it,' he said.



'I don't think it was as bad as they said it was going to be.'



Some cell phone networks were knocked out in coastal North Carolina and Virginia, and regulators warned more towers could go silent as backup batteries and generators run dry. At least 125,000 people were without landline service.



The outages could be critical for the elderly, disabled and others who rely on community services.



'What if we're without power for days?' asked Pat Dillon, 52, who is partially paralysed from a stroke.



Ms Dillon's senior care facility in Milford, Connecticut, lost power when a generator failed.



As she sat in the dark, Ms Dillon worried that her wheelchair's batteries would run out. Even worse, she needs to keep her diabetes mediation chilled.

'Once the refrigerator gets warm, my insulin goes bad,' Ms Dillon said. 'I could go into diabetic shock. It's kind of scary.'



Power companies say they'll try to get critical services running first. But many are just starting to understand the full extent of damage to the grid.



Utility workers must traverse thousands of square miles to find out what's down before they can start repairs.



'It's going to be several days at least for our most severely damaged areas' to get power back, said Mike Hughes, a spokesman for Progress Energy in North Carolina, which serves about 3.1 million customers.



Gilbert, with Connecticut Power, said it took two weeks to restore power after Hurricane Gloria knocked out service to 477,000 customers in 1985.



'And this definitely blows those numbers away,' she said.



In Virginia, Irene knocked out power to more than 300 critical services, including hospitals, emergency call centers and fire stations.



Dominion Resources expects half of those facilities to be restored by the end of the day and most of the rest fixed by Monday.



Most public health and safety facilities have backup generators, Dominion spokesman Dan Genest said. 'For those that don't, we're asking them to take care of their people as well as they can. We'll get them up as soon as possible.'","Sun, 28 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/08/30/article-2031271-0DA0B45B00000578-650_1024x615_large.jpg,"['2011', 'power', 'cottage', 'county', 'family', 'irene', 'hurricane', 'jersey', 'devastated', 'loss', 'flooded', 'tree', 'historic', 'storm', 'man', 'flooding', 'carolina', 'north']",

Unlike other Ferris wheels, it has a 15-degree incline and can resist 8-magnitude earthquakes and Beaufort scale 12 typhoons.

An elliptical track has been constructed around the edge of the tower's roof, and the 16 transparent 'crystal' pods take between 20 and 40 minutes to go round the track.

It's located in Guangzhou, capital of the southwestern Chinese province of Guangdong.

Sturdy: Unlike other Ferris wheels this has a 15-degree incline and can resist 8-magnitude earthquakes and Beaufort scale 12 typhoons

Sky's the limit: Each capsule is just over three meters wide, and built using a special macromolecule material which allows a 360-degree crystal clear view

GROUND-BREAKING RIDES

1. Kingda Ka is the world's tallest rollercoaster at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, U.S. The top tower is 456 feet tall

2. Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, is the world's fastest roller coaster with a top speed of 150mph which it can reach in 4.9 seconds.

3.Takabisha is the world's steepest rollercoaster with a drop angle of 121 degrees in Yamanashi, Japan.



4. The Singapore Flyer is a giant Ferris wheel in Singapore at 541ft tall making it the tallest in the world 5. Superman Ride of Steel in Massachusetts, U.S. wins awards every year as the best rollercoaster in the country. It speeds over 77mph, has a 221ft drop into a tunnel and 10 seconds of weightlessness



The attraction will cost visitors 130 Yuan each.



Although it's described as a Ferris, its passenger cars are not suspended from the rim of a wheel in the traditional fashion and the track is horizontal.



The tower is also known by its local nickname - Xiao Man's waist - which refers to a famous Geisha who used to entertain people during the reign of the tang Dynasty.



She was appreciated for her slim waist and the tower has a twisted and tight appearance.

In August, Las Vegas announced plans to build the world's 'tallest' Ferris wheel, which will be more than 100ft higher than the London Eye.

Caesar's Entertainment, which runs the Caesar's Palace hotel and casino, revealed its wheel will be called the 'Las Vegas High Roller' and measure 550ft.

That would pip the Singapore Flyer (541ft) to the title of world's highest wheel.



The London Eye is 443ft tall.

37,37,FL-2011-000139-CHN,Publishing in Taiwan 2011 - Publishers Weekly,https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/international/international-book-news/article/48617-publishing-in-taiwan-2011.html,"Ask any Chinese readers for their impression of books from Taiwan, and most likely they will cite meticulous editing and beautiful covers while reeling off the names of authors of literary gems, romance titles, and martial art novels. Turn to any American or European publisher, and chances are they will mention outstanding picture books with deceptively simple story lines that captivate kids and adults alike. And both sides are right on the money.

Taiwan is big on literary works and original picture books. It is also a major rights market, especially for American and European bestsellers. Not surprisingly, frenetic rights selling and buying activities are a prominent feature of the Taipei International Book Exhibition.

But this barely scratches the surface. PW turns to insiders—five of the most accomplished publishers in town—for an assessment of the industry’s current situation, as well as its challenges and future.

“Taiwan’s publishing industry is very much shaped by history,” says John Kuo, president of Book Republic. “The years under Japanese rule [1895–1945] and the subsequent government basically spelled the death of literature and publishing freedom. Only in the early 1980s did the first generation of publishing houses emerge—namely Yuan-Liou and Commonwealth—to promote original works and kick-start translations. But for most publishers of that era—myself included—publishing is a passion. We were low on capital and expertise. We pretty much made it up as we went along. In the current fast-changing Internet economy, however, publishing has to be less of a passion and more of a business proposition.”

“Very roughly, the publishing industry has probably grown 50% in the past decade,” Kuo continues, “the retail and distribution channels, 1,000%. This imbalance may be corrected by having bigger publishing houses or groups. Unfortunately, existing ones are not big enough or have huge enough capital, to influence the retail and distribution sector.” Digital publishing, he says, may provide the platform for an industry transformation and reorganization. “Everybody starts from ground zero when it comes to creating e-books or running e-bookstores. Incidentally, this change may attract the younger, Internet generation to the publishing industry.”

Meanwhile, original works are growing fast because, he adds, “There is now pride in being an author. Before, making a living off writing books was considered a dead-end career in any Chinese community. Over the next decade, I fully expect to see many more homegrown authors making it big here and overseas.”

Executive director Sing-ju Chang of Hsin Yi Foundation shares Kuo’s sentiments on digital publishing: “With cloud computing and applications making inroads into the book industry, I believe the younger generation will be attracted to participate in the search for new ways to publish, market, and sell books. A new breed of publishers will emerge to transform the industry and take it to new heights.”

For Chang, the fact that most Taiwan publishers own and manage their own companies—aside from playing the role of chief editor—is something to be proud of. “They know the market and the rules of the game very well, and, as owners, are totally dedicated to their business,” Chang says. “But these traditional strengths may hamper their ability to meet the new challenges of a rapidly changing world. We have to recognize that our publishing industry is small compared to China’s. Maybe we should join hands with our counterparts across the strait to capitalize on each other’s expertise and face the new era together.” Chang now treats the much bigger Chinese-speaking market—including China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and other overseas Chinese communities—as a single market, working to digitize content for different devices and channels to fit every territory.

As a children’s book publisher, Chang is mindful of the segment’s many challenges. “Firstly, the low birth rate is a big issue, but it is not something that publishers can solve. Secondly, it is hard to nurture homegrown talents when translated authors and illustrators garner so much attention. It is also more difficult to find a creative title that catches my attention nowadays. Lastly, young parents often do not have a habit of reading and therefore do not put much value on reading. Books now have to compete with electronic gadgets and other things like music or computer lessons for parents’ money.”

Although Yuan-Liou is one of the few publishers with the financial resources and operational capabilities to meet the digital publishing challenge head-on, the company finds the going tough, according to president and CEO Jung-wen Wang: “Even the most aggressive publishers derive less than 5% of their revenues from e-books, a figure too insignificant to merit much consideration. In contrast, online magazines and electronic databases have seen substantial growth through steady development.”

For Wang, who is also chairman of the Taipei Book Fair Foundation (an 18-member committee in charge of the annual event), the government should play a bigger role in supporting e-books by promoting digital reading. “In the B2B2C educational market, one way could be for copyrights to be shared among author, publisher, distributor, and digital service provider, and titles purchased through a government-controlled model with standardized pricing,” Wang says. “Sadly, such a model has yet to materialize. Much of our universities’ funding is now spent on imported e-publications, and elementary and high schools have no budget for e-books.”

Adding to the dilemma is that publishers, while crucial to the content-making process, are not the key players dictating e-book development. “Digital technologies have revamped the traditional publishing model,” Wang says, “and the promise of a global Web-based reading community has turned ICT [information and communications technology] companies into either effective collaborators or formidable competitors.” But the more pressing issue, he says, is how to meet the needs of a much larger market. “In the past, Taiwan publishers catered to only 23 million people who read traditional Chinese. With China [and simplified Chinese readers] now in the picture, competition for translation rights of foreign titles is intense. Naturally, Taiwan publishers also want to penetrate the mainland market. But a reading population of 1.3 billion requires new types of personnel, funding and organization.”

So the challenge is multifold: searching for good authors and quality works while plotting entry into China and e-book markets. “We have to leave our comfort zone and seek collaboration with ICT companies and even China’s publishing groups,” adds Wang. “This will bring new resources to meet the challenge. And we need our government’s support. Government-to-government negotiation on cross-strait publishing activities would speed up the creation of a unified Chinese-language publishing market.”

For publisher and editorial director Linden Lin of Linking Publishing, “Taiwan publishers’ open-mindedness is without equal. We are open to foreign authors, new themes, and different perspectives. Not surprisingly, translations account for nearly 28% of all new titles produced annually, and they include most world languages. Many of the translations make the bestseller list, a testimony to our readers’ receptivity to different types of works and other cultures. But publishers need to do more to introduce homegrown authors and Taiwanese culture abroad. One way of accomplishing this, I think, is for publishers to seriously start thinking about publishing more English titles for foreign readers. We also need to consider expanding the Chinese-reading market within Southeast Asia. The popularity of books from China has caused readers to shift from traditional Chinese to simplified Chinese. Thus, Taiwan publishers should start releasing books in simplified Chinese for export.”

Presently, most of the books available in Taiwan, adds Lin, are “published by small and medium-size publishing houses, which represent the bulk of the industry. They publish more varieties of books, thus enriching the reading experience. Some of these houses are run by the younger generation—from publishers to editors and designers—and they have lots of new ideas to offer in terms of design, format, and marketing strategy. They have made great contributions that enliven the Taiwan publishing industry.”

But the many new publications need to be put on shelves. “The lack of shelf space is not a new problem,” says Lin. “The bookstore, after all, is not a library, and it is not possible to display every book that has been published. As a publisher, we have to find other sales channels, and online bookstores and wholesale retailers are two good options.” Linking publishes about 150 new titles annually and “has kept to this figure in the past 20 years. We have no plans to reduce or increase it for the foreseeable future.”

Taiwan’s publishing industry, though in better shape now compared to a few years ago, is still at a major transition stage, says owner Rex How of Locus Publishing. “Competition between bricks-and-mortar and online bookstores has caused not only discount wars but also forced out many independent bookstores. That puts pressure on publishers. Many publishers were also thinking about developing their own e-book readers [for reading Chinese characters] before iPad became so popular. For now, publishers are seeking new markets and business models that would work in mainland China, while our counterparts across the strait have begun to seek opportunities in Taiwan. The cross-strait open policy of 2008 has certainly helped to bring the two communities closer.”

For How, a bigger market is needed to develop Taiwan’s digital publishing industry. “Talks about digital publishing typically revolve around making products that are different from traditional ones, both in the way they are read and in the way they are enjoyed,” he says. “I think we need to regard printed books more as art pieces, and digital products as interactive edutainment. If we treat both the same, then we should not be surprised by how much printed books are affected by e-books. The point is not to start a war between print and electronic books, but to create a new future in digital publishing.”

As for industry challenges, How wittily uses the winter as a metaphor. “The first challenge is the rise of e-books and digital publishing—a universal and very serious challenge. I look at it as ‘facing the coming winter.’ The second is to check discount wars between physical and online bookstores, or ‘how to escape winter snowstorms.’ The third is specific to Taiwan: how to move into and leverage the mainland Chinese market, and that, to me, is ‘searching for fire during winter snowstorms.’ ”

For more on what is happening in the Taiwan book industry, PW visits the following 13 publishing houses for a quick chat.

Book Republic

(bookrep.com.tw)

Anyone flipping through Book Republic’s 2011 catalogue would be impressed by the many big-name authors: Jostein Gaarder, Khaled Hosseini, Markus Zusak, Philippe Claudel, Frank Schatzing, Philip Pullman, Bryce Courtenay, and Neil Gaiman, to name a few. A history buff, president John Kuo has definitely chosen wide (and wise) for his target audience. “In the past, translations accounted for nearly 70% of our publishing program, but this figure is going to be lower now that we have more originals to offer. Our mission has always been to promote original works, but we have to be realistic: blockbuster translations sell, and they sell well.” He names Michael Freeman’s The Photographer’s Eye, Zusak’s The Book Thief, Hosseini’s The Kite Runner, Harold McGee’s Keys to Good Cooking, Edmondo de Amicis’s Cuore, and Kim Edwards’s The Lake of Dreams among the company’s recent bestsellers.

“Our originals have been gaining a lot of recognition in the market as well. Our biggest original project thus far—a major investment and a bestseller too—is the 100-volume Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Geography of Taiwan. It has sold more than one million sets since its launch in August 1991. Another multivolume series, also expected to have 100 volumes, this time on Taiwan history, is being developed from scratch through collaborations with experts in the field. We are targeting April 2012 for its release.”

A decade after its inception, Book Republic has published nearly 1,600 titles. Another 300 will be added before this year is out. “We also added five new imprints in 2009 and another five in 2010, taking our total number of imprints to 17. We have imprints on food, business personalities, lifestyle, health, comics, and so on. The reason behind having these imprints is simple. Firstly, we want to broaden our publishing program to cover popular and important topics in different genres. Secondly, focusing on a specific imprint allows our editors space to grow and develop their knowledge and expertise in a particular area, therefore producing more in-depth and better titles for readers,” adds Kuo. However, good editors are hard to come by in Taiwan, so Kuo has embarked on a mission to educate, develop, and train those with potential for the job.

“An editor’s job should be more than looking for typos and corresponding with authors,” Kuo says. “I want editors who can come up with original ideas for books or find the right authors for the target audience. But this nurturing process is tedious, and poaching is a common industry practice. However, someone has to do it.”

Bookman

(bookman.com.tw)

When the founder (and chairman) is an adjunct professor of translation as well as CEO of the Taiwan Association of Translation and Interpretation, talk invariably turns to translations. For Jerome Su, making foreign literary gems available in Chinese is a passion. He and his team have just translated John Banville’s The Book of Evidence, Ghosts, and Athena. “We also published his Christine Falls, The Silver Swan, The Lemur, and Elegy for April, written under his pseudonym, Benjamin Black. Mikey Walsh’s Gypsy Boy and a Korean bestseller, Mr. Hong Who Becomes an English Genius, are in the works.” Last year, Su added 60 new titles to the catalogue; 80 are planned for this year.

At his three bookstores in Taipei, Kaohsiung, and Taichung, imported books fill the shelves. “A bookstore is like a library. Graduate students, professors, and researchers visit our stores to browse through books. Nothing beats having the physical book, even in this Internet age.” Each store stocks around 8,000 to 10,000 titles and, unlike other retailers, most remain on the shelves for a very long time. Bestsellers for 2010/2011 are mostly English language-learning material, including Charlotte’s Web, which is marketed as a reading text in Taiwan.

“Demand for children’s books in English is growing as more children—and parents—are buying touch-and-feel playbooks, story books, and movie tie-in titles. Twenty years ago, when the focus was on cramming for exams instead of reading for pleasure, few wanted to import children’s books. We were then the first to bring in Eric Carle and, for a mere 500 copies, we had exclusive distributorship. Today, a 5,000-copy order would not be sufficient to earn that kind of privilege.” Not surprisingly, Su has established two imprints to tap into these growing markets: Cherry Press for children’s books and Simple Press for self-study books on English language-learning with Chinese instruction.

“With more elective courses held in English and teachers referring to English textbooks even when teaching in Chinese,” Su says, “Bookman is holding its own in the market. Furthermore, since we import key texts in bulk and have reprint rights to some of the more expensive titles, we can offer them at around 50% to 70% of the original price. Thus, we are able to compete with the more affordable pricing of e-books.”

Another Bookman affiliate, B.K. Norton, is a commission agent for about 40 overseas publishers, two-thirds of which are American houses and university presses. Many of these publishers have seen their sales increase two- or threefold within a couple of years.

China Times

(readingtimes.com.tw)

The big banner draped over the China Times office building’s facade reveals that Haruki Murakami is huge in Taiwan, and that China Times publishes his latest work, 1Q84. “We have sold more than 400,000 copies of the three volumes of 1Q84 since its launch 22 months ago,” says president Amy Mo, who also counts Dan Brown among her top authors. “More than two million copies of Brown’s novels have been sold, including 200,000 copies of The Lost Symbol.” Other recent bestsellers include Dong-seon Park’s Simple Thinking about Blood Type (80,000 copies sold), Steven Levitt’s Super Freakonomics (35,000 copies), Will Bowen’s Complaint Free Relationships, and David Lieberman’s Get Anyone to Do Anything and Never Feel Powerless.

“Park’s book, a cute and entertaining comic about blood types, is very popular back in Korea, where his illustrations now decorate a whole range of iPhone skins,” Mo says. “That such a book sells so well in Taiwan is really surprising. Zhong-liang Lou’s debut book, Telling When You Will Fall Sick, is another sleeper hit and has sold above 100,000 copies. Using Chinese astrology to predict when one would fall sick, the author became an overnight sensation when he correctly foretold the health of several local politicians and artists. Sales of two other titles—Shi-ying Chu’s A Story of Unlearning, about the author’s charitable trips abroad, and Jong-lang Liu’s Understanding Natural Science at Any Time—also surpassed my wildest expectations.”

Several new titles are in the pipeline, including Herta Müller’s Respiratory Swing, Yoshimoto Banana’s The Kingdom IV, Jose Saramago’s Abby Chronicle, Laura Hillenbrand’s Unbroken, and Ha Jin’s Nanking Requiem. Overall, translations account for nearly half of Mo’s publishing program. “We also have around 300 e-books and 10 mobile apps. But sales of these new products are minuscule because Taiwan’s B2C e-book market is still not mature.”

Two years ago, Mo established a new editorial department with the aim of developing more originals: “Judging from the success of several titles that I have mentioned, the result has been very satisfactory. Better yet, many of these originals have been sold to mainland Chinese and Thailand publishers. A new R&D division will focus on developing more original book series. You can say that originals are our secret weapons for dealing with the shrinking print book market and emerging e-book platform.”

Incredibly, Mo has been shrinking her publishing program. “Each year, more than 40,000 new titles flood the Taiwan market—far too many for our small market. So we have become much more selective and focus more effort on maximizing the exposure and sales of each title instead.”

Children’s Publications Co.

(012book.com.tw)

Now in its 18th year of operation, Children’s Publications Co. Ltd. has produced more than 1,000 titles, 85% translations. The list includes picture books, pop-up playbooks, games, jigsaw puzzles, plush-and-plastic items, and audiovisual products. Many are multivolume illustrated series geared for children below 12 years of age. Among CPL’s recent bestsellers are Peter Rabbit, The Rainbow Fish, the First Discovery series, and the Ladybird series, as well as original works Siraya Boy and The Little Owl of the Orchid Island. (The latter has been sold to Japan and Korea.)

“Siraya Boy and Little Owl are about nature, and both have sold in excess of 20,000 copies,” says chairman and CEO Robert Lin. “Siraya’s illustrator is none other than You-ran Zhang, an award winner at Bologna 2001, who has effectively transferred his love and appreciation for nature into beautiful illustrations. The Little Owl is illustrated and written by avid birdwatcher Haw-ren Ho.” Lin’s team has also published works by other homegrown talents, such as Man-qiu Lin (The Hopeful Seeds, Little Sparrow in the Gallery) and Ying-fan Chen (The Secrets of Yu-Gin Mango).

The coming months will see several new titles, including Margaret Wise Brown’s The Important Book, Susan Meddaugh’s Martha Blah Blah and Martha Speaks, Joy Cowley’s Snake and Lizard, and Alvin Hall’s Show Me the Money. The latter will kick-start Lin’s program for a series of books that teach children about money. “In today’s society, it is important for kids to start learning about money and investment as early as possible so that they can manage their allowances wisely. We are also working with Pennsylvania-based Sandvik Innovations to copublish a 12-book series for preschoolers, teaching them math, writing, reading, and so on. At the same time, our team is collaborating with a group of local writers and illustrators to produce a six-volume set on southern Taiwan cuisine. Through this series, children will learn about their own culture and get to appreciate it.”

Interestingly, about 60% of CPL’s sales come from direct selling (especially door-to-door and multilevel marketing), the rest via retail. “It helps, of course, that we are the exclusive publisher for brands such as Peter Rabbit and Ladybird—classics and proven products that literally sell themselves. We are focusing on innovative and user-friendly materials to meet the needs of children in this Internet and iPad era. You can be sure of seeing more digital content alongside traditional publications from CPL in the near future,” adds Lin.

Cité Publishing Group

(cite.com.tw)

At Cité, innovative digital products for learning feature prominently. Take the popular school activity of bird identification as an example. Cité’s team has developed a highly illustrated interactive Web-based encyclopedia that will appeal to budding and expert ornithologists. To have a bird identified at NatureSys.com/bird, users only need to type in simple details (estimated bird size, beak shape, and spotting place). “A similar Web site on minerals will be launched in November,” says general manager Alex Yeh, who is targeting NatureSys services at the B2L market (specifically, k–12 school libraries).

More technology-rich interactive products are coming. “Apps development for different platforms will continue, as will our effort to enhance Cité’s presence and coverage in the pan-Chinese market,” says Yeh. Its current 150 apps (of which 95% are for iOS) will be doubled by year-end, and there have been many successes. Aside from its Grimm Press apps (see story on page 40), there are travel guides (Tokyo Travel, Taiwan Travel in 72 Hours), an apps portal (to create various special-interest Web colonies), e-Reading Now (Taiwan’s first iPad bookstore platform, launched in December), and NongNong e-magazine (an eye-catching fashion magazine specially designed for iPad).

“As more people use smartphones such as iPhone and Android to read books, access information, and execute office and personal tasks, publishers must create content that will reach them,” says Yeh. “At Cité, we will try different publishing ideas to allow Taiwan readers to read e-books and access content anytime, anywhere.” As part of Taiwan’s biggest book and magazine publishing group, Cité has the resources to move boldly in the digital direction.

That digital focus does not mean sidelining its traditional publishing segment. Cité is responsible for introducing Kenichi Ohmae and Peter Drucker to Taiwan. It also publishes James Hunter’s The Servant (more than 200,000 copies sold), Muriel Barbery’s The Elegance of the Hedgehog (117,000 copies; still the #1 translated French title in Taiwan), Ray Kluun’s Love Life, and Harlan Coben’s The Woods. In fact, nearly two out of its three new titles are translations.

CEO Fei-Peng Ho is among Cité’s bestselling authors. “His four self-help/career titles average sales of 100,000 copies each, and his newest, Self-Proud V: Be a Noble Gentleman, will be published soon,” Yeh says. “It emphasizes the importance of integrity and self-learning in any profession. We publish many notable homegrown authors, such as Hiyawu, a bestselling e-novelist whose 14 titles averaged sales of 150,000 copies, and martial arts novelist Cheng Fon, widely regarded as the female version of Louis Cha. Our originals, just like our digital products, are made with great care, and the authors are often highly respected professionals in their fields.”

Commonwealth Publishing

(bookzone.com.tw)

Commonwealth has been introducing important Western thinkers, economists, and scientists to Taiwan readers over the past 29 years. “We view promoting progressive ideas as contributing to society, and we started doing it way back in 1982. Handy, Covey, Charan, Peters, Senge, Wilson, Feynman, you name it,” says deputy managing editor Daisy Yu, whose team will release Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs: A Biography, Julian Assange’s yet-to-be-named book, as well as new Friedman and Ohmae titles in the coming months. Robinson’s Out of Our Minds, Charan’s The Talent Masters, and Feynman’s The Feynman Lectures are out recently.

“Titles such as Getting Organized in the Google Era, Payback Time, and Buy-in are doing well,” says rights manager Violet Cheong. “We have sold more than 37,000 copies of Getting Organized since its November launch. Also, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother has sold in excess of 55,000 copies, and local author Stanley Yen’s You Can Be Different and Education Should Be Different have chalked up sales of more than 74,000 and 130,000 copies respectively.” For fiction, new titles such as Nicole Krauss’s Great House, John Verdon’s Think of a Number, David Mitchell’s The Thousand Autumns of Jacob De Zoet, and Helen Simonson’s Major Pettigrew’s Last Stand are expected to sell well upon release.

Nearly 70% of Commonwealth’s 2010 list is translated, with more U.S. and Japanese titles slated for this year. Children’s books, around 60 in all, account for one-third of its new catalogue. Kat Fall’s Dark Life and the Horrible Science series are among the new releases.

As for exports, Cheong has been doing brisk business with publishers in Korea and China. She sold My Dear and The Fox’s Moneybag to Korea’s Random House and BooknBean respectively and to China’s Qiangtao Publishing, while Stanley Yen’s two bestsellers went to Shanghai 99 Readers’ Culture.

For now, e-publishing remains on the back burner. Says Yu, “We have started investing in the infrastructure while keeping an eye on the marketplace. E-publishing has yet to arrive in Taiwan, and the majority of e-titles available out there are works in the public domain. We have produced only one e-title, for a mobile service provider, which offers it as a free download to its subscribers.” The rapidly evolving business environment and the changing habits of the younger generation who have grown up with electronic gadgets, she adds, “pose a challenge to the publishing industry in general. We have to find a way to move forward and stay relevant.”

Flaneur

(flaneur.tw)

Some major changes have taken place at Flaneur. It now operates as two distinct business units, Flaneur Culture Lab (for books) and Fisfisa (for documentaries). It also has a new CEO, Mei-li Liao, with impressive industry credentials, who has already built up a marketing team to take Flaneur to new heights. Today, its offerings are more broad-based than ever, clearly reflected in Flaneur’s recent bestsellers: Yann Arthus-Bertrand’s Home, Demos Chiang’s The Path Under the Cliff, Chuan-fen Chang’s Difficulties in Killing, and Nick Bilton’s I Live in the Future and Here’s How It Works.

“We were very experimental in our publishing program, but now we want to ensure our business is at least breaking even while continuing to bring meaningful material to readers,” says Liao. “So Flaneur will continue to publish books on lifestyle and creativity as well as retain our unique program of humanities titles and translations of French classics. Several big titles are due out soon, including Comité Invisible’s L’insurrection qui vient, David Liss’s A Conspiracy of Paper, and Clay Shirky’s Cognitive Surplus.

Her team has recently produced a few beautiful boxed sets, including Louis Vuitton: 100 Malles de Légende and The Manuscripts of Wang Wen-xing. “Wang’s original manuscripts have been kept by the National Taiwan University Library, and few get to see or even appreciate them,” Liao says. “We collaborated with the library and Professor Yi-Peng to produce this special edition, which includes Wang’s major works, Family Catastrophe and Backed against the Sea, and a collection of seminar papers on the study of his manuscripts. But the most outstanding feature, I think, is the 40-hour recording of Wang’s reading of the two novels.” For Liao, publishing an author’s archival materials—manuscripts, sketches, audio, etc.—provides a novel way of giving them a new lease of life.

Over at Fisfisa, its first documentary series, the six-episode The Inspired Island: Series of Eminent Writers from Taiwan (poemmovie.com.tw), made well over $100,000 during its run from April 9 to May 26 at local theaters. With such episodes as The Man Behind the Book, Toward the Completion of a Poem, and The Untrammeled Traveler, the series—poignantly and artistically filmed—uncovers the stories behind each writer’s creative thoughts and processes.

Says Liao, “Moving from print to other media, especially e-books, is inevitable for any publishing house, including us. Even though we have yet to launch any e-books, we are building the necessary groundwork for this new segment. Meanwhile, we endeavor to produce good print books and great documentaries.”

Grimm Press

(grimmpress.com.tw)

Grimm’s e-reader Tellybear, selling for $320 and launched in November, has been a success with kids and parents alike. “Its ease of use is one major selling point: any three-year-old, which is the target market, can operate it by himself or herself. Then there are our electronic picture books, or ePBs, which are highly animated and visually captivating. Kids can easily use the device for an hour and read about 10 titles,” says founder and publisher K.T. Hao, whose Tellybear comes with 100 Grimm titles. “I firmly believe that children should have their own electronic reading device, and through the process of creating it we keep one question in mind: how to make it attractive and user-friendly to kids.”

Meanwhile, sales of Grimm ePBs on Apple’s App Store (U.S.) have been growing steadily since the first title appeared in June 2010. “Sales are also picking up in mainland China primarily because our bilingual Chinese/English ePBs are exactly what parents want to get their kids to learn English. With pricing, we settled on $2.99 per ePB, a middle ground between the U.S. (where such titles usually go for $4.95) and China (where low pricing is necessary to attract sales).”

Hao is planning “to sell Tellybear, ePBs, and apps on both Apple and Android stores while increasing our brand presence so that more consumers know about us.” He also plans to add 100 new ePBs to the existing 250 over the next 16 months. “Now that we are about done with classic fairy tales, we are starting a new series called Short Story Masterpieces, which will include such stories as Moby-Dick, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and The Merchant of Venice. Animation will make it easy for kids to follow the story despite their young age. We are also looking into developing interactive applications based on our existing titles.” (Grimm boasts a list of 2,500 titles, mostly originals.)

Currently, its bestselling ePB is One Pizza, One Penny—Grimm’s #1 title with domestic sales exceeding 200,000 copies and six foreign language editions, having been downloaded more than 60,000 times since its launch a year ago. Other top titles include The Steadfast Tin Soldier (40,000 downloads) and Little Stone Buddha (39,000). “Our ePB sales account for one-third of our total revenue, and it will definitely surpass printed books by the end of next year.”

Hsin Yi Foundation

A New Year’s Reunion, winner of the first Feng Zikai Chinese Children’s Picture Book Award, is creating a lot of buzz for Hsin Yi. Now in Korean and Japanese, this bestseller will soon be in English (from Walker Books). “A touching story about a little girl’s Chinese New Year reunion with her father, who has been away for a whole year to earn a living in the big city, it is naturally very Chinese and yet also universal,” says executive director Sing-ju Chang. Her six-member team in Nanjing, China, helped Yu Liqiong, a young first-time writer, rework the text over 10 times. “The illustrator, Zhu Chengliang, though famous, had limited experience in picture books, and it took us a while to get the pages right.”

The new Nanjing editorial office has been looking hard for picture book authors and illustrators, and their effort has netted more than 10 titles so far. “This office also functions as our China bureau for the Hsin Yi Picture Book Award, preparing and localizing award-winning titles for publication.”

The Hsin Yi award is now in its 23rd year. “We have three winners from Taiwan this year and two of them have participated in the competition more than seven times. This award—the only one in Taiwan in this segment—offers them not only a benchmark but also a way to challenge themselves.” An animation category was added two years ago for original works or adaptations of previous award-winning titles, with Hopscotch and A Happy Wish grabbing the top prize in 2009 and 2010 respectively. “Many of the entries are from relatively young people, who are great with animation tools and techniques but lack good knowledge about publishing for children. But I’m sure this will improve given time.”

In 2010/2011, three of Hsin Yi’s bestsellers are winners of the award, namely Let’s Get Mung Beans, Momma!; Guji Guji; and Spit the Seed. “Translations such as The Very Hungry Caterpillar and Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? continue to be popular. The same goes for novelty titles for under-three, such as Taro Gomi’s Where Is the Fish?”

One of Chang’s big moves this year is to extend her publishing program to cater for 12-year-olds—with originals by Chinese writers such as I Kept My Dad in the Fish Tank and The Emperor Is a Fish—and adding more novelty titles for ages up to three, such as Tullet’s Un Livre and Yonezu’s Moving Blocks and Rainbow Chameleon. “Declining sales is a hard truth, but our Bookstart project, conducted since 2006, is doing well in Taiwan, and sales of our titles for children under three are increasing every year.”

Linking Publishing

(linkingbooks.com.tw)

Publisher and editorial director Linden Lin says “introducing foreign writers such as French authors to Taiwan is one of our missions.” He has translated Marcel Proust, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Antonin Artaud, Diderot, Marivaux, Samuel Beckett, Marguerite Duras, and Christian Jacq. Jacq’s Imhotep and Et l’Egypte s’évilla trilogy will be out soon. “In recent months, we have also introduced young French illustrators such as Olivier Tallec, Sandra Poirot Cherif and Nathalie Choux,” he says. For his contributions, France awarded Lin the Order of Arts and Literature early this year.

Lin’s team has just launched Tim Brown’s Change by Design: How Design Thinking Transforms Organizations and Inspires Innovation, Howard Schultz’s Onward, and Vanessa Diffenbaugh’s The Language of Flowers—all Linking’s bestsellers—and is working on Christopher Paolini’s Inheritance. Meanwhile, several originals have traveled abroad, including Beast and a Group of Fish That Look Alike and Gypsy to France, A Taste of Luxury and The Roof to Korea, and several comic titles to Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia. “We are also doing a copublishing project with Korean children’s publisher Yeowan Media, in which printing is done in Korea and marketing handled by us.” Children’s books make up about 20% of Linking’s catalogue. One notable project is the fully illustrated Global Kids’ Economy Village series, which focuses on one particular country’s economic story in each volume. Around 4,000 sets have been sold since its launch in October 2009.

Meanwhile, the 12-volume History of the Development of the Republic of China is slated for launch in a few weeks. “Covering six subjects—learning and knowledge, politics and the legal system, the economy, society, literature and arts, and education and culture—this is the biggest publishing project to mark Taiwan’s centennial this year,” adds Lin, whose plans for the next 12 months include creating a new team to publish original titles in e-book format and publishing books in English about Taiwan culture, with topics such as style, design, and tea making.

As for digital publishing, Lin has obtained digital rights for about half (around 1,100 titles) of Linking’s list. “About 100 e-books are available, and many more are scheduled,” he says. Linking’s parent company, United Daily News Group, publisher of one of Taiwan’s three biggest newspapers, has more digital publishing efforts.

On the retail side, its subsidiary United Distribution Company operates six stores, which contribute nearly 10% to Linking’s bottom line. One outlet, Shanghai Book Store, specializes in imported books from China. Says Lin, “We bring in new titles three times a month, so Taiwan readers get to read these new works quickly.”

Locus Publishing

(locuspublishing.com)

Illustrator/author Jimmy Liao is Locus’s indisputable star, having published 40 of his titles since 2000. “His latest, Don’t Worry, Be Happy, was out in February. Spain’s Barbara Fiore Edition has picked it up along with My Little Perfect World and Jimmy Liao: A Collection. He has been published in 12 foreign languages, including English, French, German, Japanese, and Italian,” says owner Rex How.

Besides Jimmy Liao, Locus boasts quite a long roster of well-known local authors. “Chinlun Lee, a London Royal College of Art graduate, for instance, has produced works such as No. 39 Animal Surgery and Paw in the Surgery. Her newest, Every Day Is a Good Day, was published two months ago. Then there is Miaoju Chang with her humorous and intuitive observations in Fax Diaries, My Life in Seattle, and the Du-ji Private Detective series. Another is Chih-chung Tsai with his cartoons of ancient Chinese classics. We recently published Tsai’s ambitious three-volume Eastern Cosmological Physics, which explains fundamental principles of the universe from an Eastern perspective,” adds How, whose team also published Chinese medicine expert Weikung Wang, food and lifestyle writer Craig Au Yeung, Tibetan author Woeser (Forbidden Memory, Tibet Remembered) and political novelist Lixiong Wang (Yellow Peril, Sky Burial: The Fate of Tibet).

Coming up, Locus will release, among others, Duhigg’s The Power of Habit, Allen’s Idea Man, Brashares’s My Name Is Memory, and Harkness’s A Discovery of Witches. Translations remain a big part of Locus’s publishing program. Recent titles (also among its 2010/2011 bestsellers) include Crisis Economics, The Grand Design, the Hunger Games series, the House of Night series, and The Swan Thieves. Five years ago, the rising popularity of nonfiction works on paranormal phenomena prompted How to start a special imprint, trans+, which has since expanded to include horror fiction, like Palahniuk’s Haunted, Ketchum’s The Girl Next Door, and Grahame-Smith’s Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.

In 2010, Locus established a subsidiary, ChineseCUBES, that offers engaging Chinese language-learning programs that use a never-before-seen four-skills methodology enhanced by augmented reality technology. Also, How set up Locus International in the U.S., which has published six titles, including See You in Frankfurt and Life Before Letters by Peter Weidhaas (former Frankfurt Book Fair director), The Sutra of My Heart by Chisung Hung, and three comic titles illustrated by award-winning manga artist Chen Uen (Legend of Assassins and Abi-Sword I and II).

How’s current big project is Classics 3.0 for Children. “The first 100-title series of selected Chinese classics is set for launch at the end of the year. This is also aimed at the overseas market, where interest in Chinese language and culture has picked up in recent years.”

Transmission Books and Microinfo Co.

(tbmc.com.tw)

Guided by the motto “learning has no boundary, technology has no limits,” TBMC has been specializing in online databases and digital resources since its inception in 1981. Subscribers to its 50-odd products include Princeton, George Washington University, and University of London. Over the past decade, it has also subscribed to raw data from the U.S. National Archives, and from ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center), for producing a Chinese online edition with 1.4 million entries.

Japan is currently TMBC’s biggest overseas market, and it has had various collaborations with Japanese institutions and organizations on unique projects. “For instance, we produced a database on Chinese classics for Tokyo University and another on old Chinese books kept in Japan for Kyoto University,” says chairman Felix Chu. His team also collaborated with Tokyo-based Yumani Bookstore to convert more than 340 rolls of microfilm of Taiwan Nichinichi Sinpou (1898–1945), the most widely circulated newspaper in Taiwan during the Japanese occupation. The digital version, containing three million records, has been sold to Hong Kong, China, the U.S., and many organizations in Taiwan.

“One landmark project is the Taoist Canon, widely regarded as the Taoism encyclopedia and compiled in 1445 during the reign of Emperor Zhengtong. This resource is a must-read for anyone interested in the East and Taoism.” Chu’s team also collaborated with CommonWealth Magazine, a publication recognized for its authoritative coverage of both global and regional economic and political developments. “It is a storehouse of information on Taiwan’s culture, economy, and politics. We supply all the issues—from 1981 to the present day—in e-journal format. More than 100 educational and government organizations subscribe to it.” Another major project is the CD-ROM version of Kangxi Dictionary, which was the standard Chinese dictionary of the 18th and 19th centuries and has more than 47,000 characters.

The biggest challenges to companies in this segment, says Chu, are “the availability of free and easily downloadable resources on the Internet as well as the release of large amounts of archival data by governments worldwide. At the same time, recruitment is tough. Aside from having an in-depth understanding of different content types and readers’ needs, senior staff must be expert in digital platforms, devices and technologies.”

TBMC is focusing on developing and marketing e-books while aggressively expanding its subscription base in the region. “At the Asian Online Conference and Exhibition in Hong Kong several months ago,” Chu says, “we signed an e-book project with Hong Kong University Press, with the products to be launched over the next few months. Several other big e-projects, including one on a spatiotemporal comparison database, are also in the works.”

Yuan-Liou

(ylib.com)

This is the home of Percy Jackson (and Carter and Sadie Kane) in Taiwan. So popular is Rick Riordan’s mythical world that five Percy Jackson and the Olympians titles, with sales totaling 460,000 copies, are among Yuan-Liou’s 2010/2011 bestsellers. The first title of the sequel series, the Heroes of Olympus, released in July, has already sold more than 42,000 copies. Also on the bestseller list is Tina Seelig’s What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20. “We are working on Porter’s The Price of Everything, Baker’s Final Jeopardy, Bolaño’s Savage Detectives, and Jacobson’s Finkler Question,” says Max Lin, director of research, development and rights. “Speed—and, of course, quality—counts a lot in this business. For instance, for Jim Roger’s A Gift to My Children, we managed to get our edition out ahead of the English original and have sold 100,000 copies of it.”

So it should not come as a surprise that translations take up about half of Yuan-Liou’s catalogue, which boasts such blockbuster authors as John Grisham, Michael Crichton, Stephen King, Agatha Christie, and Patricia Highsmith. “We translated bestsellers Hannah Pakula’s The Last Empress and Rebecca Skloot’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks last year,” says Lin, who has obtained the rights to the latest in the Bond series, Carte Blanche. With 22 in-house editors (in four divisions) and a pool of reputable translators, the company adds about 180 to 200 new titles every year.

For original works, two are currently flying high. One is Seediq Bale (“real man” in the Seediq language), which depicts the tribe’s trials and tribulations during the Japanese occupation. “Half of this six-volume series has been published, and Fortissimo is due to premiere the film soon. The other title, Circling the Mount, is also being turned into a movie. This story, about the 20-something author’s cycling tour to Tibet, has sold more than 100,000 copies,” says general manager Chuan-li Lee, whose roster of bestselling homegrown authors includes Jin Yong (aka Louis Cha, the renowned martial arts novelist), Hong Lan (psychologist and author of eight parenting titles), Jiang Xun (an aesthetics and lifestyle writer), Shiang-hui Wu, Ke-xian Liu, and Lin Xi.

Adds Lee, “We have collaborated with manufacturer ViewSonic and technology company Koobe Inc. to digitize Jin Yong’s 15 novels and load them on an e-book reader. This bundle sells for about $500.” Meanwhile, 16 children’s titles—four English language titles and the Chinese Children’s Illustrated Folktales series—have been turned into iPhone apps. “In total, our e-publishing program has about 2,000 titles, and more are coming.”","Fri, 09 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.publishersweekly.com/images/data/IMG/img/000/000/1-3.PNG,"['books', 'titles', '2011', 'chinese', 'book', 'publishing', 'authors', 'series', 'taiwan', 'digital', 'publishers']",

""The Outer Banks has taken a hit, and we saw damage everywhere we stopped,"" Gov. Bev Perdue said. ""Lives have been lost, homes and property destroyed. But this storm could have been worse, and North Carolinians are resilient.""

About 2,500 people who defied mandatory evacuation orders were stranded on Hatteras Island after pounding surf washed over dunes, covering roads with water and sand. The flooding cut off the island from routes leading to the mainland.

""There was a lot of carnage on Hatteras Island and I feel for those people,"" U.S. Coast Guard Rear Adm. William Lee told CNN after surveying the damage from the air.

An emergency ferry will be sent to the island to bring in supplies, CNN's Brian Todd reported after taking a helicopter tour of the island. However, the ferry may not arrive until Monday. Those who stayed behind were prepared for such a situation though, telling Todd that they have enough food and water to last a few days.

""It looks like an earthquake hit it,"" Todd said of the barrier island's main road. ""The storm and storm surge just completely chopped up the road, and the ocean is now washing over it.""

One home on the island had burned, possibly from downed power lines, and Lee said the home appeared to be a ""total loss.""

Three of North Carolina's deaths involved traffic wrecks during the storm. Another person died when he was hit by a tree limb, while feeding livestock. A fifth died of a heart attack as he was putting plywood over this windows ahead of the storm's arrival.

Some 444,000 were without power Sunday afternoon, officials said. Irene had stomped across the state most of the day Saturday after a morning landfall near Cape Lookout at the southern end of the Outer Banks.

Most of the damage was centered between Cape Hatteras and Oregon Inlet, Lee said.

The storm ripped shingles and siding off buildings in Atlantic Beach, knocked over a church steeple and flooded homes in low-lying areas. At least 10 major roads were closed and airports were forced to shut down, Perdue said.

By midnight Saturday, Kill Devil Hills had endured 31 hours of nonstop rainfall. Firefighters waded through knee-high flood waters as they responded to calls in the community.

The nearby town of Wanchese was reported under water, officials said.

In Duck, North Carolina, the storm pushed water from the Currituck Sound inlet out to the sea, resident Gregg Nigro said.

In Greenville, Mike Sharpe woke to find water under his living room door.

""The front parking lot is just as flooded, and the cars have water up past their doors,"" he said. ""Everybody's a little worried. We didn't expect to have any flooding. That's something we weren't prepared for.""

Glenn Williams watched the storm from his downtown Raleigh office.

""I just come down here in the hurricane because it's safer than it is at home where all the trees are at,"" he told CNN affiliate WRAL-TV.

Through it all, residents maintained their good humor.

In Kill Devil Hills, the boarded-up shop windows displayed spray-painted missives to Irene: ""I have enough women in my life, Irene,"" said one. ""No crabs for Irene,"" said another at a seafood shop. ""Don't be mean, Irene,"" said a third.

In some areas, beachcombers looked for any shells Irene had deposited.

Surfers reveled at their good fortune at Wrightsville Beach, taking advantage of the bigger waves dished up in the aftermath of the storm.

""It's the wind and the waves and the culture,"" Dane Reynolds telling WRAL why he was out in the post-storm surf. ""It's all about the culture of the surf community.""","Mon, 29 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/US/08/28/north.carolina.aftermath/tzvids.hatteras.island.irene.gi.jpg,"['hit', 'stranding', 'lee', 'irene', 'thousands', 'hammers', 'homes', 'surf', 'todd', 'water', 'storm', 'island', 'carolina', 'north']",

Typhoon Nanmadol, which struck Monday, brought wind gusts of up to 137 kph (85 m.p.h.) and rainfall of more than two feet in the mountains. But during the workday, cars swarmed through the capital Taipei for the usual rush hour, coffee shops filled with students on their final days of summer break, and hotel conference centers buzzed with corporate press conferences.

“Through [Typhoon] Morakot two years ago and some heavy storms last year, we’ve been rigorously tested, and since the land warnings were issued this year, we focused more on the typhoon’s strength and scale to make the right preparations,” says Chung Chia-bin, vice magistrate of Pingtung county in southern Taiwan.

“Also since then, lots of infrastructure has been strengthened, for example roads and bridges, so these largely avoided disaster,” he adds.

Taiwan is used to typhoons, as the island of 23 million people gets three or four per year. Office workers joke that they encourage typhoons to land mid-week so they can take government-ordered days off work. Surfers launch themselves into typhoon-driven swells instead of fleeing the coast.

Taiwan’s government has also learned from its worst storm in 50 years, Typhoon Morakot in 2009. That storm set off a mudslide that killed 700 people, angering many who felt the government could have reacted faster.

Before Typhoon Nanmadol reached Taiwan and weakened to a tropical storm, authorities had evacuated about 11,000 people.

[ Video is no longer available. ]

A disaster response center run by the Ministry of Economic Affairs had put the Army on alert, stashed food for any long-term evacuees, and monitored 318 creeks in canyons prone to mudslides as the storm passed over south Taiwan.

When flood waters began rising in parts of Taiwan, the government sent pumps to keep the levels low. Electricity at all but 5,100 households of the nearly 40,000 that lost it had been restored by 7 p.m.

Nanmadol, which killed at least 13 people in the Philippines, left one person dead in Taiwan. He was a motor scooter rider who slid on a wet ramp. Flooding left a relatively light NT$10 million (US$344,000) in damage to the island’s farms.

The storm is expected to clear Taiwan by Tuesday morning.

Willie Shaw said he was so close to getting the Stanford head coaching job in 1992 after Dennis Green left for the N.F.L. that he had met with the university president and that a team meeting and a news conference were scheduled to announce his appointment. Green recalled that Willie was “an eyelid away.”

But the sudden availability of Bill Walsh dashed that plan. As always, Willie Shaw did not become bitter, but rather moved on to the next stop.

“If I was on the committee, I would have hired Bill Walsh over me too,” he said.

And after seeing all those disappointments up close, his wife, Gay, knew the significance of the hug between Willie and David.

“There was so much that wasn’t said, that was felt in that moment,” Gay Shaw said. “It was part of what you do as a non-Caucasian in this land. Since I’ve been in the Bay Area and met a lot of Asian people who have had similar experiences. There’s an unspoken bond between me and these ladies and our husbands. We don’t complain, but we keep on fighting.”

As a Stanford receiver, David earned the nickname Coach Shaw for being a stickler with the underclassmen, and he even begged Walsh to call the play — a shallow cross known as 76X — that resulted in his first touchdown. Still, Shaw insisted that he would not follow his father into coaching, and he nearly joined an asset allocation firm after graduation. But he felt a tug.

“I wasn’t ready to put on a tie,” he said.

They also can be the car’s most expensive component, mostly because of the complexity in making them, rather than the value of the materials.

Complicating the question of disposal, a large amount of energy remains stored even in partially discharged batteries. These could deliver harmful shocks and pose a serious fire hazard if mishandled.

For now, automakers are going their individual ways.

Toyota Motor, whose experience goes back to 1998, shortly after the introduction of the RAV4 all-electric vehicle, has established partnerships in Europe and the United States to recycle batteries, including from the hybrid Prius. This year, it began shipping some batteries from Prius models sold in the United States to Japan to take advantage of a more-efficient recycling process at home.

Honda Motor recycled nearly 500 batteries during 2009 from the electric hybrid models it began selling in Japan more than a decade ago. But it still is exploring ways to structure that part of its business as it rolls out models like the Insight and the CR-Z.

General Motors and Nissan Motor, whose Chevrolet Volt and Nissan Leaf are newer to the market, are taking a different tack. They have agreements with power companies to develop ways of reusing old batteries, perhaps for storing wind or solar energy during peak generating times for later use.

Bayerische Motoren Werke, known for its premium BMW line, still is carrying out research on whether to recycle or reuse the batteries from its Mini E, an all-electric car it began leasing on a limited basis in 2009.

Meanwhile, some governments have begun to get involved to ensure their car industries are not undermined by sourcing or safety issues.","Tue, 30 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2011,"['challenges', 'states', 'pose', 'batteries', 'began', 'allelectric', 'united', 'recycling', 'cars', 'hybrid', 'electric', 'fancy', 'ways', 'motor', 'recycle', 'models']",

While it's clearly an oversimplification, we couldn't allow this anniversary to pass without offering our own list of ""winners & losers"" in the decade since 9/11 and the accompanying ""war on terror.""The years since 9/11 have witnessed the biggest expansion of the U.S. national-security state since the Cold War. Over the course of the decade, Washington has spent well over $7 trillion on the Department of Defense, the intelligence community, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. (The U.S. intelligence budget alone, for example, has doubled over the past 10 years.) The creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the establishment of a new Director of National Intelligence amounted to the largest reorganization of the federal government since World War II.Many of the details remain obscure, however, thanks to a corresponding widening of the culture of official secrecy. In its expose "","" ""The Washington Post"" revealed that 854,000 people now hold top-secret security clearances, and that 33 building complexes had been built for top-secret intelligence work in Washington and the surrounding area since 9/11. ""Together they occupy the equivalent of almost three Pentagons or 22 U.S. Capitol buildings -- about 17 million square feet of space.""During their fight to establish control over Afghanistan in the 1990s, the overwhelmingly Sunni Taliban massacred Afghan Shi'a and killed 10 Iranian diplomats stationed in the north of the country. So Tehran was only too happy to see the Americans wipe out the Taliban government in autumn 2001. Iran's leaders were even happier when the new government of President Hamid Karzai turned out to include leading members of the Northern Alliance (including many Persian-speaking Tajiks who had benefited from Iranian support during their long years of resisting the Taliban). In 2003, when U.S. troops invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam Hussein, the Iranian government had reason to rejoice again. Hussein, the man who unleashed the eight-year Iran-Iraq War in 1981, was Iran's bitterest enemy, and his Ba'athist government was replaced by leading members of Iraq's majority Shi'ite community. Many of them had lived in Iran or otherwise enjoyed Iranian sponsorship for decades before the U.S. invasion.All this has considerably boosted Iran's regional influence even as the country continues to develop its nuclear program.Before 9/11 there were just a few private security companies in the world, usually operating well outside the limelight. But over the past decade the business has. That growth has spurred concerns about the wisdom of empowering private companies to carry out many of the functions once performed by the official military. During the war in Iraq the name of the company Blackwater became such a synonym for gun-toting irresponsibility that it was forced to rebrand itself. (Now it calls itself, rather mysteriously, ""Xe."") Next year, the U.S. State Department is actually set to double the number of private security contractors working for it in Iraq (from 2,700 to 5,500).Of course, 9/11 has been a boon to the broader private security industry as well. Everyone from the manufacturers of airport scanners to those little bottles for getting your shampoo past security have seen a windfall as well.Ex-KGB man Vladimir Putin rose to the presidency on the back of his prosecution of Russia's second war against Islamist rebels in the breakaway North Caucasus republic of Chechnya. Before 9/11, many Western governments criticized Russia for its attack on the separatists, which included indiscriminate use of bombing and artillery and the ""disappearing"" of large numbers of young Chechen men. Ties between some of the separatists and Al-Qaeda received considerably less attention. But in the wake of the attacks in New York and Washington, only the latter point seemed to matter any more. The Kremlin and the White House agreed to share intelligence and cooperate in Afghanistan, and U.S. criticism of Russia's human rights record suddenly quieted dramatically.Other dictators in the post-Soviet Union -- especially in Afghanistan's Central Asian neighbors -- were also happy to play up the terrorist threat in return for U.S. support. All too often the need to keep supply lines to the war effort in Afghanistan trumped human rights concerns.During the Cold War, the West's communist opponents prided themselves on their atheism, which made professing the creed of nonbelief somewhat complicated. Not so in the 21st century. The spectacle of religiously motivated aggression presented by the September 11 attacks has provided a powerful argument to those who dismiss faith as mere superstition. Philosopher Daniel Dennett, physicist Stephen Hawking, and journalist Christopher Hitchens have all figured prominently in the attack on organized religion. Prominent atheist Richard Dawkins sold 2 million copies of his 2006 book ""The God Delusion"" --before the start of the ""war on terror.""Atheists still face something of an uphill climb, though: Islam remains the world's fastest-growing religion, and an overwhelming majority of Americans continue to profess belief in God.By the end of the last century, the U.S. aerospace industry had developed remote-controlled unmanned aircraft that used advanced communications and information technology to spy on hard-to-reach targets in far-away places. Then someone got the idea of putting missiles on the drones. Ten years later, the military robotics industry is. The U.S. Air Force now trains more operators for ""remotely piloted vehicles"" than it does pilots. The success of U.S. drone warfare is driving a global boom in military robotics that is transforming the nature of war itself.Even though Turkey has had a few scattered problem with Islamists of its own, the decade since 9/11 has been mostly the story of a steady uphill climb. The government of moderate Islamist Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who came to power in 2003, has overseen a period of strong economic growth that it has used to bolster its credentials as the one country in the greater Middle East that has managed to embrace progress even as it stresses its Islamic roots. Erdogan has managed to maintain Turkey's NATO membership even while the Turks have defied the United States on some issues (such as denying access to U.S. troops on their way to invade Iraq in 2003). Turkey has also boosted ties with countries like Iran and Syria at the same time as it has pursued improved relations with the European Union and Russia. The post-9/11 dysfunction of places like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia has helped Turkey to burnish its credentialsIn the weeks following September 11, Congress passed two laws that gave the White House far-reaching powers for prosecuting the war against Al-Qaeda. The first, the Authorization for Use of Military Force, granted the president the authority ""to use all necessary and appropriate force"" against the terrorists -- essentially carte blanche for the president to do whatever he deemed worth doing. The second, the USA Patriot Act, gave the federal government broad scope for conducting surveillance against its own citizens with the aim of preventing future attacks.Over the past 10 years the Supreme Court and Congress have curtailed much of the power that the executive branch accrued during the opening phases of the ""war on terror"" -- but not all of it. Though the Obama administration has put an end to some of its predecessor's policies, including the approval of some forms of torture in interrogations, President Barack Obama has also extended some parts of the Patriot Act. He is holding to aand he has continued the CIA's drone campaign against targets in Pakistan with minimal public accountability. But then, don't wars always end up giving more power to presidents?The antisecrecy website's greatest scoops -- hundreds of thousands of declassified cables on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- would have had far less oomph with no ""war on terror"" to illuminate. WikiLeaks impresario Julian Assange likes to compare himself with Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg, whom he credits with singlehandedly ending the Vietnam War. (Didn't the Viet Cong have something to do with it? Never mind.) Let's face it, revelations about trade negotiations just aren't as sexy.Thirty years of war have not helped Afghanistan's environment, which is also bedeviled by drought, deforestation and the plundering of resources. But one ray of light shone through this summer when the country's national environmental protection agency approved protection for 33 endangered species in the country, including the(panthera uncia). There's little the government can do to enforce its laws, but every little bit helps; the Taliban would have never gone to the trouble. The recent creation of a national park in Bamiyan Province also raises hopes that Afghanistan's nature can finally catch a break.2,996 people lost their lives in the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, and in the aircraft that crashed into them. 1,300 orphans were created that day. In the 10 years since, the New York City coroners' office-- just under 60 percent of the total. The rest remain unofficially accounted for. The terrorist attacks of September 2001 tore a hole in the lives of thousands of people that can never be filled.Small wonder that 500 relatives of the 9/11 victims are suing the bin Laden family company and Saudi princes for $1 trillion. The aim: to prevent future financing of similar attacks.Yes, Al-Qaeda succeeded in striking a huge blow at the United States and its economy. Yet the organizers of the attack clearly did not foresee what they were unleashing. In his statements during the 1990s, Osama bin Laden referenced the 1983 suicide bombing in Lebanon that spurred Ronald Reagan to remove U.S. Marines from that country as well as the 1993 Mogadishu battle that led the U.S. to abandon its Somalian peacekeeping operation. Bin Laden believed that the Americans were too cowardly to retaliate on a grand scale. As a result, the full-blown U.S. assault on Afghanistan in the weeks after 9/11 clearly caught him off-guard, and the main Al Qaeda organization never really managed to recover its balance. Osama bin Laden is dead. The planner of the 9/11 attack, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, is in U.S. captivity. Countless other Al-Qaeda operatives have been killed or captured, reducing the organization to a shadow of its former self. Unfortunately, the ideas that fueled it live on.The political and religious tensions fueled by the 9/11 attacks and the U.S. response to them have affected no country more dramatically than Pakistan. Over the past 10 years more than 30,000 Pakistanis have died as the result of terrorist attacks -- including Benazir Bhutto, the country's former prime minister, and a number of other leading cultural and political figures. U.S. attacks on jihadi safe havens in the Pakistani tribal areas have fueled an anti-Western backlash among many people in the country and exacerbated an already severe jihadi threat. The spiral of radicalization threatens the very integrity of the country.The overwhelming majority of Pakistanis are likely more concerned about development than politics. But they have seen little benefit from the billions of dollars the United States has transferred to Islamabad in the years since 9/11, most of which has gone straight to the military.Just over 6,000 U.S. service members have lost their lives in the U.S. ""war on terror,"" and another 43,000 have suffered injuries. The second number might not seem so daunting until you realize that a large percentage of those wounds involve severe brain trauma and the loss of one or more limbs as the result of hugely destructive roadside bombs favored by insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan. The flood of casualties has overtaxed the health system for veterans.The brunt of the vast overseas military commitments assumed by the United States since 9/11 has been born disproportionately by the relatively small number of Americans who serve in the armed forces and their families. Many regular soldiers and Marines have spent multiple tours of duty overseas -- creating enormous burdens for their families at home. Civilian America, by contrast, has made few comparable sacrifices for the war effort.2,753 of the nearly 3,000 people lost on 9/11 died in the World Trade Center. Among them were 343 firefighters and 60 police officers. People from some 70 countries were among the dead, reflecting New York City's vaunted multicultural character. Another 422,000 New Yorkers have displayed symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder since the attacks. And thousands of first responders -- firefighters, medical emergency personnel, and others who participated in the rescue effort at Ground Zero -- appear to be suffering from lung disease and cancer as a result of inhaling toxic fumes and dust from the collapsed towers. Hundreds of them have died since the attacks, though it is hard to be sure just how many of those deaths can be attributed directly to the aftereffects of 9/11.The city. It was compelled to accept billions of dollars in emergency aid from the federal government in the two years after the attacks. It is estimated that New York City has lost a net total of 100,000 jobs in the decade since 9/11. And that's not even to mention the invisible hole in a majestic skyline.Rank-and-file Muslims in the United States and Great Britain had to cope with a flurry of hate crimes and angry incriminations in the aftermath of 9/11 attacks. Though many Muslim organizations publicly distanced themselves from Al-Qaeda and its actions, Western public opinion tended to focus instead on indications of strong anti-Western sentiment in many Islamic countries -- especially in reaction to America's military and political interventions in the Middle East and South Asia.In fact, though, there is plenty of evidence that Muslims' revulsion toward Al-Qaeda and its allies has steadily grown over the years -- not least because it is mainly Muslims who have died in the countless suicide bombings in Iraq and Afghanistan. (Indeed, Al-Qaeda's No. 2, Ayman al-Zawahiri, once famously chided Iraqi Al-Qaeda operative Abu Musab al-Zarqawi for unnecessarily stoking sectarian warfare.) Nowadays jihadi websites tend to spend lots of time complaining about their inability to find recruits.The polarizing effect of 9/11 and America's response to it long overshadowed theuntil the 2009 Green Revolution in Iran and the more recent Arab Spring, which have shown that many young Muslims around the world reject violence and terrorism and aspire instead to peaceful political change.Before 9/11 only 10 percent of bags checked on flights in the United States were screened for weapons or explosives. Five weeks after the attacks, President George W. Bush signed a law mandating that all bags be screened. U.S. airline passengers, previously accustomed to only cursory checks, now had to get used to arriving at airports hours in advance, removing shoes, belts, and water bottles before submitting themselves to elaborate checks. As the U.S. authorities demanded comparable scrutiny on flights coming into the country, these innovations have rippled out through the international aviation system.On the planes themselves, a new era of vigilance and paranoia kicked in -- sometimes justifiably, as shown in the case of the ""underwear bomber"" thwarted by passengers in December 2009. Back on the ground, though, the effects are debatable. Recent tests of airport security systems by enterprising journalists have shown that determined smugglers can still get plenty of dubious articles through the checks.The informal and anonymous networks used for financial transactions in much of the Middle East and South Asia. But the revelation that Al-Qaeda sometimes used hawalas to transfer the funds for their operations triggered a backlash. In Afghanistan, U.S. task forces have cracked down on leading hawalas to curtail financial flows of drug lords and insurgents. The U.S. Treasury Department has pressured Dubai and other Persian Gulf banking centers to implement tough money-laundering laws. And U.S. intelligence agencies have used electronic-surveillance techniques to ensure that the money changing hands through hawalas is clean. Hawalas may never be the same.Pacifists are still around, but arguing the case has certainly become harder in an age when terrorist groups explicitly embrace suicide-bombing attacks on defenseless civilians. (""Where Have All the Pacifists Gone?"" ran the plaintive title of one 2003 essay.) In the United States, a wave of patriotic sentiment in the wake of the attacks inspired thousands of college-age Americans to sign up for military service rather than antiwar demonstrations.The peaceniks who remain earn respect precisely for their noble persistence in the face of overwhelming odds. The name of one group formed by family members who lost loved ones in the 2001 attacks says it all: "".""Osama bin Laden made sure that most of the hijackers on the 9/11 planes were Saudi citizens -- knowing that the resulting revelation would complicate the kingdom's relationship with the United States. It worked, at least in part. While Washington and Riyadh have more or less managed to carry on as before, U.S. public opinion toward Sauid Arabia has taken a nosedive. 9/11 threw a harsh spotlight on Saudi financial support for many extremist groups around the world as well as the Neanderthal doctrines of the Wahhabi Islam practiced inside the kingdom. No one in the outside world cared much about Saudi women being denied the right to drive until after 9/11.And even as the longing for reform seems to have gained strength in the wake of the Arab Spring, Al-Qaeda-style radicals who decry the royal family's decadent habits are still finding plenty of traction. The monarchy's future does not look promising.","Thu, 08 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.rferl.org/Content/responsive/RFE/en-US/img/top_logo_news.png,"['states', 'alqaeda', 'united', 'afghanistan', 'losers', 'attacks', '911', 'war', 'president', 'iraq', 'security', 'winners']",

ISRO scientists have given the green signal to the engineering model, while the flight model is being assembled in Banglore, IIT-K Registrar Sanjeev Kashalkar said.

Over 62 students and faculty members of the institute worked hard to built ‘Jugnu’ weighing 3 kg, he said.

On being asked about the delay in the project, he said it took some time for the faculty members and students as it was an indigenously built satellite.

“Jugnu is likely to be launched by the end of next month if everything goes according to our plans,” he said.

Even though Rs. 2 crore was sanctioned for developing the satellite, the cost was brought down to a lesser amount as the institute came up with indigenous technique, he said.

The ISRO and IIT-K had signed a MoU to develop the micro satellite in 2008.

The satellite which will be in the space for about a year will be launched with the help of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), he said.

The data received from ‘Jugnu’ will be studied with the help of a tracking system installed at IIT-K and the received pictures and information from it will be used for research purpose.

The satellite will help in gathering information regarding flood, drought and disaster management, he said, adding its control room and ground station both will be at IIT-K.","Mon, 29 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,"['plans', 'students', 'saidthe', 'nano', 'help', 'launched', 'iitk', 'launch', 'built', 'jugnu', 'institute', 'received', 'satellite']",

The system which was a tropical depression up to this morning (Sept. 7), was recently updated to tropical storm status.

And according to information obtained from the St. Kitts Meteorological Office, Maria is currently located approximately 1414 miles to the east south east of St. Kitts and the projected path suggests that the Federation will begin feeling its effects sometime between 2:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. on Saturday (Sept. 10).

Maria travels in a west-north-westerly direction at about 23 miles per hour (mph) and has maximum sustained winds of 50 mph.

SKNVibes understands from the St. Kitts Met Office that by 8:00 p.m. on Saturday, it is expected to pass 50 miles away from Basseterre, St. Kitts.

National Disaster Coordinator, Carl Herbert, in speaking with SKNVibes, asked that residents monitor the system and reminded all to take the necessary precautions to prepare themselves for any eventualities.

“I just want to appeal to residents that as Tropical Storm Maria approaches we need to be vigilant and actively prepared, that is, making certain that we recognise that tropical storms are weather systems that do create quite a lot of damage especially if there is flooding.

We are appealing to persons to ensure that at their premises, whether domestic or commercial, there are no items around that can become missiles that would fly through the air in a storm.

“We want to appeal to persons to stay indoors while weather systems are passing. Also, we want to urge persons not to drive vehicles in ghauts and water courses that may be flowing heavily and to avoid – especially pedestrians – trying to cross ghauts and water courses during heavy flow as one can be washed down during passage of those heavy flows of water.”

He also reminded persons to stock up on nonperishable items, and to secure important documents in plastic containers.

The St. Kitts Met Office indicated to this publication however, that the federation may experience thunderstorms as early as this evening (Sept. 7), which are associated with a nearby tropical wave.

“Clouds associated with a westward moving tropical wave are expected to spread across the northwest Caribbean today and tonight. This will bring cloudy skies with scattered showers over St. Kitts and Nevis today and tonight.

Roc-A-Fella, Def Jam

Last week the New York Times' Michiko Kakutani made waves with an essay in which she declared that, ten years on, ""9/11 has not provoked a seismic change in the arts."" It's hard to know whether she's right—accusing something, anything, of ""not provoking a seismic change in the arts"" seems strange—and hard to know how much to care. September 11 and its aftermath certainly gave writers something to write about and singers something to sing about, but the best songs aren't always about what they claim to be about, and art that sets out to respond to a specific event is often handcuffed by literalness. Much of the most memorable art surrounding 9/11 wasn't occasioned by the tragedy but rather coincidentally attended it: the Strokes' ""New York City Cops,"" pulled from Is This It on the eve of release, or Bob Dylan's ""High Water (for Charley Patton),"" the homage to Patton's 1929 flood blues ""High Water Everywhere"" that appeared on Dylan's Love and Theft, released on 9/11 itself.

Decadence is restyled as subversive resistance, the hustle of crack cocaine as the hustle of the global superstar: The game is the game is the game.

Jay-Z's The Blueprint also came out on September 11, 2001, an incidental bit of trivia that will be obligatorily mentioned for as long as the album is discussed, which will be a very long time indeed. Jay-Z's influence on hip-hop is massive and varied, but his greatest achievement is his longevity: Many rappers before had stuck around, and aged gracefully—KRS-One, LL Cool J, the Beastie Boys—but Jay-Z has been at the top of the genre for nearly all of his 15-year career, the longest sustained reign that rap has ever known. The Blueprint was when the consensus around him solidified, a moment that now seems so preordained that it's easy to forget how it actually happened.

The life and times of Shawn Carter, vol. 1: He'd emerged in 1996 with a masterpiece debut, Reasonable Doubt, a frantic cyclone of storytelling delivered in a nervous, nasal voice and a flow that was unrelenting and slightly awkward, like that of a man who'd found himself trapped in a conversation he wasn't sure he wanted to continue. It was a quirky, arresting style that seemed an acquired taste, which made it all the more surprising when Jay-Z crossed into mainstream stardom with unexpected speed. In My Lifetime, Vol. 1, released in 1997, went platinum, and 1998'sVol. 2… Hard Knock Life, buoyed by its impossibly great titular single, sold 5 million copies.

By the turn of the millennium, Jay-Z had become the most powerful rapper in the world by almost any measure, but musical returns were diminishing. Each new release felt flimsier than the last, thinned by filler and guest appearances, and singles sounded increasingly detached and calculated. October 2000 saw the release The Dynasty: Roc La Familia, a showcase for protégés Beanie Sigel and Memphis Bleek, who appeared on 11 of the album's 16 tracks. It shot to No. 1, but the fact that it was released under Jay-Z's name felt cynical. Jay-Z was starting to seem boring, but he was also just starting to seem bored.

Then, in summer of 2001, a new single dropped. Produced by a young Chicagoan named Kanye West and based around a chopped-and-diced sample of the Jackson 5's ""I Want You Back,"" ""Izzo (H.O.V.A)"" was an urgent explosion of ideas: nimble, ferocious and deadly serious, a song so good and so sudden that you might still remember the first time you heard it. A new album, The Blueprint, was slated for the fall. Pitched explicitly as a comeback, the title alone raised eyebrows, and there was a feeling in the air that stakes were about to rise.

Jay-Z had (and, really, still has) essentially made a career out of rapping about three things: the drug game, the rap game, and various spoils accumulated from each (money, women, Bentleys, more drugs). He was neither the first nor thousandth person to rap about these things, but he was the first to build such remarkably sustained success out of doing so, and herein lay a problem. When you're on MTV every five minutes and releasing multi-platinum albums on a yearly basis, the suggestion that you're still finding the time to sell crack in the projects out of some insatiable and purely recreational love of the game is, frankly, ridiculously stupid.

By 2001 this paradox was collapsing on Jay-Z: How does a burgeoning mogul and darling of the mainstream—one who would turn 32 years old that year—maintain a persona dependent on poverty and youthful transgression? Or, to put it more simply: how do you grow up when all anyone wants you to do is keep talking about when you were a kid?

The Blueprint solved this by building a daring and dazzling metaphorical bridge between the underground economy of street hustling and the thoroughly above-ground economy of music stardom. In some senses it's an obsessively backward-looking album: ""Heart of the City (Ain't No Love)"" boasts a Bobby Bland sample and name-checks everyone from the Fat Boys to Richard Pryor while alluding to Jay-Z's younger days and referencing his 1996 classic ""Can I Live?"" The Blueprint consolidated Jay-Z's hustler past and his musical past while self-consciously positioning him within a grand tradition of black culture.

What's more, it did this in a way that was eloquently and powerfully righteous. ""I'm representin' for the seat where Rosa Parks sat,"" he declares in the album's opening track, the Slick Rick homage ""The Ruler's Back,"" and the audacity smolders: not Rosa Parks, but the seat itself. The first line of the second verse of ""Izzo""—""I do this for my culture / to let 'em know / what a n*gga look like / when a n*gga in a Roadster""—is as powerful a defense of conspicuous consumption ever articulated, and the ""this"" is pointedly ambiguous. Decadence is restyled as subversive resistance, the hustle of crack cocaine as the hustle of the global superstar: The game is the game is the game.

It was a subtle and extraordinary maneuver that reinvigorated Jay-Z and gave both him and hip-hop a path to adulthood. Jay-Z may never escape the enormous shadow of Notorious B.I.G.—a statement that probably applies to literally any rapper alive—but Christopher Wallace sadly never had to confront how to grow up in a music culture in which past indiscretions aren't just things you talk about but the essence of who you are. The Blueprint was a monumentally significant rap album made by an artist in his thirties: No such thing had previously existed.

The Blueprint didn't so much re-invent rap as the possibilities of rap stardom, which for practical purposes might be more significant. Ten years after September 11, 2001, Jay-Z is a towering figure in American culture, a businessman and ""business, man,"" an acclaimed author, a man at the ear of mayors and presidents. He is not yet 42 years old. The Blueprint continues to live up to its name.","Fri, 09 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/static/b/theatlantic/img/lacroix-default-thumbnail.png,"['starting', 'blueprint', 'release', 'jayz', 'turn', 'grew', 'game', 'vol', 'later', 'single', 'youre', 'released', 'jayzs', 'day', 'rap', 'things']", 
54,54,FL-2011-000139-CHN,Commodity Price Deflation? Not Likely | Gold News - BullionVault,https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news/deflation_commodities_martenson_090820114,"Chris Martenson takes a look at the case for falling commodity prices...

A FEW deflationists out there are calling for a top in commodity prices. Their argument is pretty clear cut: Because inflation is a function of available money plus credit (their definition), and because credit has fallen, deflation is what comes next, writes Chris Martenson.

When looking about for things to deflate in price, commodities are an obvious candidate for attention because they have risen so much over the past decade.

In this view, three things have to be true:

Demand for commodities has to fall below supply. After all, as long as demand exceeds supply, prices will typically rise. Money, including credit that would normally be used to buy commodities, has to shrink. That's the definition of deflation that we're analyzing here. People's preference for money has to be greater than their preference for 'things,' with commodities being very obvious 'things.' That is, faith in money has to be there or people will prefer to store their wealth elsewhere.

These are all just versions of the old supply/demand argument for commodity prices, except that our consideration also includes the important element of the Austrian economic view of demand for money.

There are several reasons why I think there are serious holes in each of these conditions. Enough to warrant a healthy degree of caution in one's certainty about what 'must' happen next to commodity prices. Full disclosure: I continue to have 75% of my total net worth locked up in gold and silver, so I am decidedly in the camp that does not believe the commodity surge has yet run its course.

Before we tackle each of those three conditions from above, let's look at the chart for the Continuous Commodity Index (CCI) to see what it might be telling us.

First, let's examine the period after the great bust of 2008 (a liquidity-driven event) and note that commodities essentially rose during all of 2009 and then formed a classic 'bull flag' formation in early 2010.

It should be noted that calls of commodity ""topping"" were also made at this time by several prominent deflationists. However, a topping pattern and a bull flag are very different beasts. So I was quite content to keep my calls for more commodity price increases intact at this time, even though they spent six months trending lower in this consolidating pattern, because the chart looked quite bullish to me.

And I was watching the near-daily Fed injections of thin-air money into the system, reading about surging Chinese demand, and tracking our negative interest rates at the same time -- all features that are supportive of higher commodity prices.

Note also in the above chart that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on top was in neutral territory and rising (green line above) and that the momentum indicator (MACD) was also rising (green line below), both of which are typically bullish patterns. None of this was at all consistent with topping. It doesn't rule a top out, naturally, in trading and markets anything can happen, but these are not the usual signs one expects at a top.

Now let's expand the chart out and see what happened next:

First, we might observe a 43% run-up in commodity prices over the next eight months following the bull flag we just dissected. Note that it is almost uninterrupted during the period from July 2010 to April 2011.

Second, we might ask ourselves what sort of a pattern we currently have in the commodity index chart. Rather eerily, because one rarely sees such a perfect repeat of patterns, what we see is another almost identical bull flag complete with rising RSI and MACD readings.

On the basis of these technical readings, I would be extremely cautious in making a call for commodities to spike down from here. Instead the chart is pretty clearly calling for another run to the upside. Again, this might not happen, and commodities could always fall from here, but a bet made in that direction is fighting a pretty powerful chart.

Now let's turn to the fundamental reasons that support the idea of a bullish commodities chart.

Condition #1: Supply Exceeds Demand

A key component of the deflation argument is that with credit shrinking, demand will drop, leaving excess market supply that resolves with lower commodity prices. Housing in much of the Western world, for example, fits this definition nicely. Too much was built while prices ran too high, and the bursting of that bubble is now resolving itself through lower prices.

Commodities have a long and storied history of boom/bust/boom, with supply and demand alternately racing past each other as the lag times for developing new supply assure too much at some point and too little at others.

What's new in this story today is the emergence of a couple of new economic powerhouses with billions of citizens as new participants at the resource table.

India is one of them, and the recent 'bad news' out of there was that the Indian economy only grew at 7.7% in the most recent quarter:

India's economy grew 7.7% in the three months from April to June, compared with the same period of 2010. It was India's weakest growth for six quarters, but still better than had been expected. The manufacturing sector grew 7.2%, an improvement from the previous quarter, but well below the 10.6% in the second quarter of 2010.

While the 7.2% growth in the manufacturing sector was downplayed in most articles in comparison to the prior 10.6% growth, it is useful to remember that a 7.2% rate of growth translates into a full doubling over just ten years' time. In other words, in ten years, India's manufacturing sector -- the one that consumes lots and lots of natural resources -- will be consuming twice as much of everything as it does now.

It is this massive rate of growth that is eating into the world's remaining resources and creating competition for most basic natural resources.

As big as India is, and as fast as its rate of economic expansion is, it is dwarfed by China on both counts:

SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - UBS cut its 2011 and 2012 growth forecasts for China on Thursday to reflect weaker growth prospects in developed economies, saying the central bank may relax policy if the world's second-largest economy falters. UBS now expects 2011 gross domestic product growth of 9 percent, down from its earlier projection of 9.3 percent. For 2012, it sees GDP growth of 8.3 percent, down from its previous forecast of 9 percent, it said in a report.

Again, while the emphasis in this article is on weakening growth, we should also be sure to note the absolute rate of growth here.

Global slump? What global slump? China is slated to grow its already huge economy by 9% this year (2011). If that rate of growth were sustained, China would double its economy in just eight years. Twice as much of everything would be consumed in just eight years.

When you are talking about 1.3 billion people doubling their intake of economic goods and services in just eight years, you are talking about the fastest absolute increase in demand placed on natural resources ever seen in world history. Faster and faster and faster; more and more and more.

What sorts of news items might we expect to accompany such a proposition? Perhaps some like these:

China's corn demand mindblowing

China's struggle to meet the growing demands of its middle class is fueling a sudden surge in demand for corn, sending vast ripples across the US farm belt and potentially upending the grain's trade flows around the world. China's need for corn -- which forms the basis of sweeteners, starch and alcohol as well as feed for livestock -- was on stark display in July when the nation ordered 21 million bushels of US corn in one hit, more than the US government thought the country would buy in a year. Corn prices, which have nearly doubled over the past year, climbed another 1% Tuesday.

China's appetite for oil imports increases

BEIJING, Aug. 15 (UPI) -- China's dependence on imported oil grew to 55.2 percent in the first five months of this year up from 55 percent last year, reports state-run news agency Xinhua, citing figures from China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. In 2009, however, China's dependence on imported oil rose to 33 percent.

(Source)

China's Natural Gas Consumption Climbs 32 percent

Industrial Info Resources reports China's apparent natural consumption reached 11.1 billion cubic meters in July 2011, an increase of 32 percent from July 2010 and a 3 percent increase from June 2011, according to data issued by the General Customs Administration of China (GCAC). As consumption increased, the import volume of natural gas also jumped from 15 percent to 25 percent over the same time period.

Securing uranium supplies still essential to China's energy security

China has 14 operational nuclear reactors and according to the World Nuclear Association, 77 more reactors are either planned or under construction with aim toward increasing nuclear capacity to 80 GWe by 2020, 200 by 2030 and 400 GWe by 2050. However, the nation's domestic uranium resources don't even come close to the amount needed to fuel such an expansion. To secure uranium reserves, China has been aggressively moving to sign supply contracts and joint venture mining agreements as well as to purchase uranium mines overseas. By 2020, China is expected to account for 20 percent of global uranium demand, according to Resource Capital Research.

There are loads of similar articles covering China's aggressive expansion into Africa's resource plays, energy deals across the globe, and arable land where it is available. We're seeing exactly what you would expect from a major economy expanding like crazy: a rapidly growing, or, shall we say, exponentially increasing hunger for natural resources.

Perhaps a slump in the Western economies will suddenly flood the world with enough resources to cause a commodity crash, but perhaps not.

The supply-and-demand argument rests on the time-tested notion that with increased demand, new supplies are brought to market. This has more or less always been true, although astronomical prices will not get you a passenger pigeon and rising prices seem unable to drag more giant Bluefin Tuna from the seas. The point there is that the usual supply and demand argument falls apart in the presence of limits.

Jeremy Grantham, who previewed my book last fall and provided a blurb for its jacket cover, has been all over the news lately talking about a profound structural shift in natural resources:

Grantham concludes that the world has undergone a permanent ""paradigm shift"" in which the number of people on planet Earth has finally and permanently outstripped the planet's ability to support us. Specifically, Grantham says, the phenomenon of ever-more humans using a finite supply of natural resources cannot continue forever--and the prices of metals, hydrocarbons (oil), and food are now beginning to reflect that.

In other words, Grantham says, it is different this time.

Grantham believes that the trend of the last 100 years, in which the prices of almost all major commodities have steadily declined, is permanently over. And from here on in, humans will be competing more--and paying more--for ever-scarcer resources. From a societal standpoint, the news is far worse. Grantham believes that the planet can only sustainably support about 1.5 billion humans, versus the 7 billion on Earth right now (heading to 10-12 billion). For all of history except the last 200 years, the human population has been controlled via the limits of the food supply. Grantham thinks that, eventually, the same force will come into play again.

Instead of oil being in a spiked-top formation ready to fall back to its prior range of $20-$30 a barrel, Grantham argues that oil has shifted to a new price level. I have argued the same thing, not by using price charts, but through the fundamental analysis of oil supply in the context of Peak Oil coupled with an understanding of the marginal cost of producing a new barrel.

If it costs $70 - $80 to produce a new barrel of oil, the price cannot fall much below that for very long.

So on the first deflationist point that supply of commodities will soon greatly exceed demand, I have to conclude that until and unless we see China's and India's economies fall off a cliff, the impact of bringing an additional 2.5 billion consumers to the global buffet of natural resources will provide ample pressure to prevent a sustained crash in prices. Perhaps we'll experience a short-term correction, especially if the Fed is stingy with its still-unannounced QE III program, but a long-term crash seems highly unlikely.

Condition #2: Money Plus Credit Shrinks

The second key deflationist assumption is that the supply of money plus credit will decrease. Central to this argument is the idea that it's insufficient to track the money supply alone and that it's essential to include the expansion (and/or contraction) of credit as well. This makes sense on the surface, because credit allows people to buy things and buying can translate into price pressures. More credit means more buying pressure; less equals the opposite.

But I have a number of difficulties with this view over the long-term. (Hey, credit has to be paid back at some point, right? So it's roughly neutral over the long haul.) This explanation is especially problematic for me when it is used in an overly broad way by lumping all credit market debt into a single spot and then saying, ""There. Look. It's fallen. Credit is down, and that's deflationary.""

The trouble I have with this view is that not all credit has the same impact on demand. Some credit leads to demand that directly impacts the CPI (inflation), and some does not. When we are talking about inflation, what most people care about is the price of things they use or consume (cars, food, gasoline, health care, houses, etc.), rather than financial instruments or paper assets (stocks, bonds, derivatives, etc.)

Let's put it this way: If you give someone a billion Dollars in credit, it matters significantly whether they go out and buy ten thousand silos of corn or one twentieth of the next ten-year Treasury bond auction. In the latter case, nothing much happens to everyone else's inflationary experience, but in the former case, the price of corn goes up. A lot.

In other words, credit extended within and among the financial community mainly flows within and among the paper assets of the world, while non-financial credit goes to consumers, businesses, and governments that use the credit to buy real things.

[Note: One aspect of financial credit takes us to the world of shadow banking, where financial institutions and purely financially oriented participants buy and trade financial instruments generally just within and among themselves, often with tremendous leverage.]

Whether credit-default swaps (CDS), traded within and among the shadowy world of purely financially motivated entities, are trending up or down in price has almost zero impact on the price of molybdenum or corn. Therefore it is important for us to separate credit into its financial and non-financial components.

On this basis, if we look at total credit market debt broken out into its two main components (financial and non-financial), we see that instead of credit falling in general, it has fallen only in the financial world, but has climbed by an amount almost exactly offsetting it in the non-financial sectors:

Yes, financial-sector debt has fallen by $3 trillion, and that is a drag on total credit market debt, but as explained above, we wouldn't expect this to have much of an impact on inflation for anything other than paper assets. Non-financial debt, on the other hand...

...has rather steadily climbed uninterrupted before, during, and after the Great Recession. Credit market debt within the physically consumptive portion of the economy has climbed by nearly $3 trillion, almost perfectly offsetting the non-financial decline. But the offset is just an interesting observation that really tells us nothing about the inflationary or deflationary effect of credit expansion/contraction on the things that are tracked in the CPI.

So on the basis of credit alone, I find the deflationary argument to be weak. There's been $3 trillion of new credit created in the consumptive portion of the economy since the start of the financial crisis in 2008, and it's almost entirely thanks to government borrowing. Not too shabby.

Turning to money itself, the deflationary argument becomes a lot more difficult to sustain. Money is measured by the Federal Reserve in various ways that are called the ""M's."" M1 is the narrowest version, representing cash in and out of the banking system and demand accounts (savings and checking) at the bank. Just look at M1 lately:

The increase in M1 since the start of the financial crisis (red box) is the same as the entire accumulated supply of money that existed in 1992 (green box). That is, as much M1 money has been created in the past three years as was created from the founding of this country through 1992.

It's really hard to square up that data with a deflationary argument. I have to assume that at least part of the reason for the big increase in M1 is people like you and me taking cash out of the bank, necessitating the printing and distribution of more cash.

M2 represents a slightly broader definition of money:

M2 includes a broader set of financial assets held principally by households. M2 consists of M1 plus: (1) savings deposits (which include money market deposit accounts, or MMDAs); (2) small-denomination time deposits (time deposits in amounts of less than $100,000); and (3) balances in retail money market mutual funds (MMMFs).

A chart of M2 reveals a steadily increasing rate of money creation that has been especially intense over the past few months:

There is absolutely nothing deflationary in the M2 chart. It is exactly what we would expect to see from a culture that placed a man at the monetary helm on the basis of his promise (Jackson Hole, 2002) to run the printing presses if deflation came knocking.

Because M2 includes time deposits, which are generally locked up (in CDs and such) and therefore not immediately available for use, and it excludes institutional money funds (that might be used to buy things), it might not be the best indicator of money that can trot out of an account and create inflationary pressures.

For a better measure, I prefer MZM, or money of zero maturity, which includes institutional money funds andexcludes time deposits. Here's a chart of MZM:

Yes, there was a little wobble downwards in MZM right after the end of the last recession, but over the past two years (red dotted lines), we note that a trillion Dollars in new MZM has entered circulation (blue dotted lines).

Again we might note that it took all of US history until 1982 to create the first trillion of MZM money stock, but only two years for the most recent trillion.","Thu, 08 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news/files/09082011_Commodities_Bull_Flag2.png,"['demand', 'commodity', 'credit', 'deflation', 'price', 'growth', 'prices', 'money', 'supply', 'financial', 'world', 'likely']", 
55,55,FL-2011-000139-CHN,Perpetual warfare - New Statesman,https://www.newstatesman.com/global-issues/2011/09/afghanistan-iraq-west-world,"The 11 September 2001 attacks were a new kind of warfare. Waged by small, decentralised, highly mobile groups not identified with any state or government, this hypermodern type of conflict aims not to conquer territory or destroy the enemy's military forces, but to weaken the adversary's society internally. For all its medieval trappings, al-Qaeda is deeply modern: its ideology owes more to Lenin than to Islamic theology, while its organisation is that of a decentralised global franchise operation.

The US response was a variant of conventional warfare: a Vietnam-like counter-insurgency directed against the Taliban in Afghanistan - only incidentally connected with al-Qaeda but an equally elusive force - followed by an attack on the state of Iraq, the effect of which was to allow al-Qaeda to build a presence in the country that it had lacked when Saddam Hussein was in power. The new type of war was not understood, and the failure of the US-led riposte was preordained

Terror is not a nebulous, all-pervading, demonic force. In more clear-thinking times, events that are now routinely described as acts of terrorism were seen as episodes in normal historical conflicts. Politicians and military people spoke of civil wars, insurrections and political assassinations rather than lumping together all forms of political violence into a single terrorist threat. It was also understood that political violence can never finally be eradicated. Today such sobriety is rare. Suicide bombing is interpreted as the expression of a religious culture of martyrdom, when it is a technique that was first developed by the Tamil Tigers, a Marxist-Leninist group.

The 1995 Oklahoma bombing and the 22 June massacre on Utøya island show that indigenous, far-right ideas can also have deadly effects; the Aum Shinrikyo cult in Japan would have wreaked cataclysmic damage if it had been able to implement its plan to use anthrax against the population. In Britain, far more people have been killed and injured by offshoots of the Irish Republican Army than by Islamist groups. If we are to talk of terrorism, the intimidation and murder by some American fundamentalist Christians of doctors who perform abortions also falls into that category. The threats to peace and security that we face are more specific and more diverse than the global evil posited in the ""war on terror"".

When it launched the 9/11 attacks, al-Qaeda demonstrated a firm grip on strategic logic. Nothing could be better calculated to throw western governments into panic than an assault on the World Trade Center - a monument to faith in the civilising magic of affluence. Later attacks in Bali, Madrid, London and elsewhere demonstrated the capacity of the network to operate on a global scale. A sober response to 9/11 would have involved focusing resources on intelligence-gathering and using the results to deter and disable terrorist activity in the countries that al-Qaeda was targeting. Instead, the west's response has been much as al-Qaeda's strategists intended: a succession of costly, unwinnable conflicts that have eroded the west's freedom and diminished its security, while exacerbating the serious but not unmanageable threat posed by al-Qaeda itself. If it is true that the danger may now be receding, it is because new movements of change are making al-Qaeda increasingly irrelevant.

The conflicts triggered by 9/11 have all been fought on false premises. Bombing al-Qaeda bases in Afghanistan was a legitimate act of self-defence and, in the context of US politics, may have been inevitable, but it was not the only option. The relationship between the Taliban and al-Qaeda has never been simple or unproblematic, and there is evidence that the Taliban may have been considering expelling al-Qaeda from Afghanistan when the bombing campaign got under way. Whether an alternative strategy, focused on convincing the Taliban regime to enforce such a policy, could have been effective is uncertain. What is clear is that, ten years later, the US-led coalition has been exploring a similar scenario - tacitly recognising that the fundamental problem has never been military. Even more than the Soviets - whose ruthless occupation some Afghans now remember as being preferable to the chaos of the present conflict - western forces have fought a war that lacked any achievable political goals. Unfortunately, the prospect of an orderly exit may prove to be just another mirage.

Welcomed by many Afghans and by some of the Taliban, the initial objective of ejecting al-Qaeda from the country was soon achieved. It is doubtful how much western security was improved. Al-Qaeda does not need permanent bases and has moved on to Pakistan, Yemen and post-Saddam Iraq. As the US became ever more preoccupied with a non-existent threat from Iraq, Afghanistan was forgotten and the Taliban returned.

The war has continued, with a series of shifting goals - installing democracy, promoting economic and social development, battling the drug trade and the like - all of them unrealisable. Building schools and hospitals may be a fine thing, but it will count for nothing when teachers and doctors are terrorised and killed after allied forces make their inevitable withdrawal from much of the country.

Linking the Afghan mission with the nonsensical ""war on drugs"" has been predictably counterproductive. Destroying drug production - the Americans at one point thinking of spraying the whole of Helmand Valley with weedkiller to wipe out the opium fields - would also have destroyed much of the Afghan economy. There is constant talk of preparing government forces to take over responsibility for security, Bamiyan being the first province handed over, on 17 July. But where government is weak and lacking in legitimacy, and where allegiance to any authority has long been a tradable commodity, it should be obvious that improving the training of local forces will not ensure their loyalty. Presiding over a territory that has never been ruled by a modern state, the Afghan government is not much more than a funnel for endemic corruption. In the event of a full-scale pull-out of US-led forces, it would be lucky to survive for more than 48 hours.

In the blind rush to export an idealised version of western governance, it has been forgotten that democracy comes in several versions, some of them highly illiberal. If a functioning democracy were to develop in Afghanistan in the current conditions, it would most likely be a variant of the Rousseau type that exists in Iran. The effect could be to entrench the power of the Taliban.

Built up by elements in Pakistani intelligence and financed with Saudi money, the Taliban waged a pitiless war on Afghan culture and traditions. At the same time they flouted the most basic human values. Stoning gay people and women who are victims of rape is barbarism pure and simple. Rather than preventing such atrocities, an Iranian-style Afghan democracy could instead confer legitimacy on those who commit them.

It is hard to imagine any kind of democracy in Afghanistan in the foreseeable future. In the event of a full drawdown of western forces, a many-sided civil war would ensue and the hapless peoples of Afghanistan would face a future without effective government, democratic or otherwise. At this point, the analogy with Vietnam becomes misleading. In Vietnam, the US retreat allowed the well-organised and competent government in the North to take control of the country. In Afghanistan, departing US-led forces would leave an ungoverned space.

Again, the underlying problem is political rather than military. There can be no peace in Afghanistan for as long as it is used as a theatre to play out regional conflicts. Without a solution to the division of Kashmir, the Afghans will continue to be pawns in the struggle between India and Pakistan (both nuclear powers) while Iran, Russia and China watch alertly on the sidelines. Perhaps Washington could once have brokered a settlement in the region, but with President Barack Obama having declared victory 18 months in advance of a US retreat, that time is gone. A pull-out would create a geopolitical vacuum in the region. That is why - assuming a worsening economic crisis in America doesn't force the issue - US forces are unlikely to make anything like a total withdrawal any time soon.

In contrast to Afghanistan, where even the Soviets could not instal a modern state, Saddam's Iraq was a thoroughly modern despotism. If western intervention in these quite different countries has failed in similar ways, one reason is that, in both cases, the west was unprepared to deal with the condition of anarchy that it had created.

Regime change in Iraq was engineered in the belief that something like liberal democracy would emerge of its own accord. But after nearly a quarter-century in power, Saddam's dictatorship was practically coextensive with the Iraqi state, and toppling the tyrant meant destroying any kind of government in the country. US policies - such as disbanding the Iraqi army - hastened this outcome, but it was principally a consequence of regime change itself. As the scale of the disaster began to unfold, it became conventional wisdom to claim that insufficient thought had been given to post-invasion planning. But before the war started it was clear that no one had the skills required to govern the failed state that the overthrow of the regime would create. The result - the Kurds hiving off as a de facto independent state and the rest of what had been Iraq governed by a shifting coalition of sectarian parties, with Shia politicians increasingly under Iranian influence - was in no way surprising. If there had been any serious forethought, the invasion would not have been launched.

It is not often that foreign policies come to grief because of an intellectual error, but this has been the case ever since the idea of humanitarian war took hold during the 1990s. Semi-successful in the Balkans, humanitarian intervention fuelled the illusion that - with only a small dose of force - freedom and democracy could be implanted anywhere in the world. Since then, the western elite have been gripped by the idea that authoritarian regimes are atavistic relics that will soon be swept aside in the grand march of history. There is nothing atavistic about tyranny - Nazism and Stalinism were unequivocally modern, like al-Qaeda today - and freedom is not the same as democracy.

Neoconservatives talk sagely of being ""on the right side of history"" - as if a process of evolution had begun, at the end of which all of humankind will at last become like the neocons. Rather, what is happening is that the world is returning to the normality of only a few centuries ago, when power and wealth were more evenly distributed between east and west. There is nothing that need be feared in this shift, but it destroys the myth that the west is a model for the whole of humanity.

The notion that the Arab spring is a rerun of Europe's 1848 revolutions is an example of this kind of thinking. Those who make the comparison are asserting ownership of movements that owe very little to the west. When Tony Blair and his fellow neocons tell the Arab world that it must modernise, they assume that modernisation is a quick and peaceful process that ends with the adoption of ""democratic capitalism"". A little history shows a different picture. The popular protests of 1848 were soon defeated. Europe became democratic only after two world wars and a long cold war. Building a Europe of democratic nation states was a lengthy and violent business, involving ethnic cleansing between the two wars, and then again after the fall of Yugoslavia in 1991.

Nor is the global order that was then put in place in any sense stable. The European project is coming apart at the seams, while in the US - only a few years ago incessantly lecturing the world on the need to embrace the ""Washington consensus"" - the financial system has collapsed. Supposedly the end of history, ""democratic capitalism"" of the sort that prevailed over the past two decades now looks like a blind alley.

In this light, why should the peoples of the Arab world retrace the west's journey? They would be better off striking out on paths of their own. Western declarations of support for the new Arab protest movements are in any case sel­ective. Not much outrage is voiced at torture and murder in Bahrain - home to a US navy base, and a vital link in the supply of oil from Saudi Arabia.

Lying behind these inconsistencies is an awkward geostrategic fact. When they give rhetorical backing to protest in the Middle East and North Africa, western governments are speaking as they did when they backed democracy in the Soviet bloc. Yet while the fall of communism seemed for a time to enlarge western power, the west now finds itself in the position of the former Soviet Union, losing control of events as popular uprisings threaten regimes it has kept in power for decades.

It is often claimed that the uprisings in the Arab world show that the west has been short-sighted in pursuing stability over more high-minded goals. It was not western realpolitik which triggered the protests, however. Much has been written about the role of social networks in powering the uprisings, and new media were undoubtedly an important factor. But, to an extent that has not been appreciated, the Arab protest movements emerged as an unintended consequence of western weakness. The demand for change had a specific cause: the steep rise in food prices that was produced by the liquidity released by Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, into global markets. Quantitative easing (QE) is, in effect, a policy of creating new money and, just like money-printing by governments and central banks in the past, it tends to produce inflation. In this case, the inflation showed up in asset prices - in stock markets and on the commodity markets.

The protests in Tunisia began as bread riots, and though graduate unemployment may have been a larger factor in Egypt, the protests there occurred against a background in which the country - one of the world's biggest importers of wheat - was facing a steep rise in the price of food. Not only in the Middle East but in the world as a whole, there is a looming problem of food scarcity, which is partly a result of the sheer growth in human numbers, projected to increase from roughly seven billion at present to more than nine billion in 2050. The sudden rise in the cost of food was not only a result of increasing demand, however. Another factor was the Federal Reserve's attempt to refloat the sinking American economy with a flood of cheap money, beginning with the ultra-low interest rates engineered by Alan Greenspan from 2001 onwards, which led to a speculative boom in commodity prices. Driving up living costs in poor countries that import much of their food, American monetary policy has been a potent force for regime change. In an ironic twist, US weakness has unwittingly sparked revolution in the Arab world as its blundering attempts to impose regime change by force have been swallowed by the sands.

There are some who see the entire war on terror as a cover for neo-colonialism. Behind all the pro­clamations about democracy and human rights, they say, the real goal was building pipelines in Afghanistan and seizing oilfields in Iraq. In fact, the course of events has been much more absurd. There is no evidence of consecutive thought of the kind required to make any conspiracy theory credible. Certainly there has been disinformation - plenty of it - but rather than concealing any covert strategy, it masked the lack of any strategy at all. Despite denials at the time, oil was a crucial factor in the decision to invade Iraq, but western companies cannot operate effectively in conditions of near-anarchy, and it was only at the start of this year that Iraqi oil production reached levels it achieved under Saddam. Again, there was never any realistic chance of western forces using Afghanistan as an energy corridor or of harvesting the country's abundant mineral wealth - if any country benefits, it will be China, which by standing aside from the conflict does not face the security problems of western businesses and has a better chance of establishing a long-term presence in Afghanistan. The wars of the past decade have been colossally expensive, costing billions of dollars and accelerating the US decline into national bankruptcy. As an exercise in neocolonialism, perpetual warfare has been strikingly unprofitable.

More than by disinformation, the decade of war has been shaped by delusion. Today, for western leaders, the utility of force is not so much to achieve any specific goal as to preserve a sense of their importance in the world. Wealth and power are flowing to the east and south, but Europe and the US still claim global leadership. More than by any humanitarian impulse, it seems to have been this need to reaffirm a distinctive western destiny that motivated the Libyan adventure.

Fearful of being dragged into the chaos that will ensue if Libya fragments, the Obama administration has not been a cheerleader for this intervention, which is primarily a European folly. The commonplace that Nato forces lack a clear exit strategy misses the point. How could they have such a strategy, when they have no rationale for being in Libya in the first place? Intervention might have been justified if the objective had been simply to prevent carnage in Benghazi - though the risk of killing on the scale that is happening in Syria, where the west has shown no interest in intervening, seems to have been small.

But an end to violence could be secured only by negotiating with Muammar al-Gaddafi and leaving him in power, an outcome unacceptable to David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy, insecure and impulsive leaders anxious to make their mark on the international scene. So, Britain and France have opted for regime change, risking creating another failed state. Libya does not have the religious divisions of Iraq, but now that the fragmented opposition finds itself struggling to govern a still tribal and fractured country, it must be an open question whether a tolerable level of order can be maintained without further engagement by the west - including boots on the ground.

The posturing that has surrounded the Libyan adventure highlights the contradictions of humanitarian warfare. Its advocates declare that the west has a duty to protect universal values, with neoconservatives railing against critics as feeble moral relativists. Coming from neocons, who more than anyone else undermined the ban on torture - one of the fixed points in any civilised ethics - the assault on relativism has a hollow ring. However, the contradictions of humanitarian warfare affect its more principled advocates as well. Contrary to postmodern relativists, some values are humanly universal. The trouble is that these values are often in conflict. Peace and justice are universal goods, but they are at odds in Libya. Branding Gaddafi a war criminal (as the International Criminal Court did on 27 June) may have been right in terms of justice. Whether he would have chosen to leave if the way had been smoothed for him (as some in the Obama administration seem to have wanted at one time) cannot be known. But closing off any exit for the Libyan tyrant could only have had the effect of prolonging the war. Humanitarian military intervention is exposed to these conflicts of values just like any other kind of warfare.

The illusions of liberal intervention are screening out the risks faced by western countries. One comes from upheaval in the Gulf. Peak oil leaves Saudi Arabia the world's pivotal producer. Any disruption in production resulting from conflict in the Gulf would detonate an oil shock bigger than any other in the past. Contrary to what some on the left believe, the greatest danger of war may not come from the US or Israel. Upheaval in Bahrain illustrates the mounting risk of conflict between the Saudis and the Iranians, which Olivier Roy (""The long war between Sunni and Shia"", New Statesman, 20 June 2011) has described as the defining schism in the Middle East - a schism whose depth was revealed when a former head of Saudi intelligence warned Nato officials in June this year that the kingdom would build nuclear weapons once Iran acquired them. As it drifts away from Europe, Turkey, too, is becoming an increasingly powerful player in the region.

The west would be wise to curb its dependency on oil, but that will not remove the risk of resource wars. The coming conflicts will not be mainly between the west and the rest. Advancing industrialisation has set in motion a new Great Game in which western states are not the most important players. China is the world's largest energy consumer after the US and will soon be first; but its fiercest rival for oil in future is likely to be India, rather than the US.

The danger comes not only from peak oil. Peaking minerals, arable land and fresh water are likely to inflame existing conflicts and spark new ones in many parts of the world. As Mark Lynas has noted (""Panic stations"", New Statesman, 21 March 2011), countries that reject nuclear power are likely to turn to coal and gas, speeding up global warming as a result. Some countries may well try to control the climate through geo-engineering, and it would not be surprising if weather-modifying technologies were turned to military use.

If a new pattern of conflict is developing around natural resources, another is emerging in cyberspace. There are those who argue that the danger is being exaggerated, but there can be no doubt that as the economy and infrastructure become more reliant on computers, they become more vulnerable to cyber-attack. Practically every part of an advanced modern society can be disabled in this way - power supply, airports, banks, companies, television stations and personal computers, for example. Cyber-attack already occurs frequently, with episodes reported in the Baltic countries and the Middle East, among other places. Touted as a realm of freedom and transparency, cyberspace has become another site of conflict.

Our present insecurity is not a passing phase - a station on the way to a state of peace and stability. Insecurity will be the common con­dition in any future that is realistically imaginable. Our leaders should be looking for intelligent ways of adjusting to this state of affairs. But it is precisely the capacity for realistic thinking that is lacking. Talk of victory in Afghanistan is delusional - just as the idea that liberal democracy would follow regime change in Iraq was delusional. Yet the role of such discourse is not to represent things as they are, nor even as they might some day become. It is to create a pseudo-reality that insulates rulers and those they rule from painful facts.

The September 2001 attacks succeeded in producing what their perpetrators intended: a suspension of rational thought. Beginning as an ill-considered response to a new type of conflict, the permanent warfare that followed became a displacement activity, the function of which has been to distract attention from the west's problems - declining skills, falling living standards, debt and festering unrest.

Sooner or later, the cost of maintaining the west's illusions will become prohibitive. Countries whose economies are floundering cannot for long sustain vast, costly and ineffective military-industrial complexes. To be sure, the retreat of western power will not usher in any age of peace. War will not cease, if only because conflicts over natural resources are certain to increase. The normal conflicts of history - including many types of political violence - will continue. But the curtain is about to fall on the absurd and gruesome spectacle of the past decade, when the west waged unceasing war in order to avoid confronting its true position in the world.

A dazzling array of colours from a spectacular fireworks displays lit up the waterfront in Auckland, New Zealand on Friday as the country's largest city launched the 2011 Rugby World Cup.

A joyous opening ceremony featuring hundreds of dancers and singers as well as a reported three tonnes of pyrotechnics helped mark the start of the country's biggest ever sporting event.

Around 60,000 rugby fans had packed into Auckland's Eden Park to witness the official start of the tournament.

The showpiece event featured a stylized sequence in which a young boy in a rugby jersey smashed through crowds of would-be tacklers who fell at his feet like skittles.

Meanwhile dancers and singers, some dressed in traditional Maori attire, helped kick off the tournament.

Other stylish celebrations during the flamboyant ceremony aimed to celebrate the game, as well as the Maori landscape and cultures of the Pacific.

First Kiwi Prime Minister John Key and chairman of the IRB Bernard Lapasset addressed the crowd ahead of the opening match between hosts New Zealand and Tonga.

New Zealand also hosted the first ever Rigby World Cup in 1987, and the lavish ceremony today was a far cry from the low-budget affair 24 years ago.

Maori welcome: The ceremony was colourful and energetic

In the center of Auckland, thousands of New Zealanders showed their national pride by waving flags draped in Kiwi colours in a display which brought traffic to a standstill in the afternoon.

Cars came to a halt and blared their horns in Queen Street, Auckland's main thoroughfare, as fans hung out the windows screaming support for their national teams.

Flags hung from office and apartment windows as their occupants poured into the streets.

By far the noisiest crowds after New Zealand's were the Tongans, whose team faced off against the All Blacks at Eden Park, home of New Zealand rugby, after the official opening ceremony.

Schools and businesses closed early so Auckland residents could beat the traffic home or join the mobs in the city center.

The thousands of home fans inside Eden Park were certainly not disappointed with the opening match, as the All Blacks beat their Polynesian neighbours Tonga 41-10.

The celebrations came at the end of a perfect spring day in Auckland, when leaders from around the Pacific wrapped up four days of talks as part of the 42nd Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting.

At a closing press conference, Prime Minister Key said preparations couldn't have gone better.

'We're really pleased with the weather - it's been a magnificent day in Auckland,' said Key.

Asked which nation he had adopted as a 'second team' as New Zealanders had been asked to do, he quipped, 'I'm adopting Tonga because I want them to come second tonight.'

Gates to Auckland's waterfront, which the government has nominated 'party central' and erected a purpose-built venue dubbed The Cloud after it wavy white roof, shut about an hour before the official opening ceremony.

Trains, buses and ferries in the city were stopped or delayed as the authorities said it had reached capacity.

Sally Woodfield, spokesperson for the Real New Zealand Festival, which is organizing a series of events around the country for the tournament, said in The Cloud that she could not estimate the numbers at the venue.

'There's been nothing like this in New Zealand before, but it's gone off amazingly well,' said Woodfield.

58,58,FL-2011-000139-CHN,The GOP War on Voting - RollingStone.com,https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/the-gop-war-on-voting-242182/,"As the nation gears up for the 2012 presidential election, Republican officials have launched an unprecedented, centrally coordinated campaign to suppress the elements of the Democratic vote that elected Barack Obama in 2008. Just as Dixiecrats once used poll taxes and literacy tests to bar black Southerners from voting, a new crop of GOP governors and state legislators has passed a series of seemingly disconnected measures that could prevent millions of students, minorities, immigrants, ex-convicts and the elderly from casting ballots. “What has happened this year is the most significant setback to voting rights in this country in a century,” says Judith Browne-Dianis, who monitors barriers to voting as co-director of the Advancement Project, a civil rights organization based in Washington, D.C.

Republicans have long tried to drive Democratic voters away from the polls. “I don’t want everybody to vote,” the influential conservative activist Paul Weyrich told a gathering of evangelical leaders in 1980. “As a matter of fact, our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down.” But since the 2010 election, thanks to a conservative advocacy group founded by Weyrich, the GOP’s effort to disrupt voting rights has been more widespread and effective than ever. In a systematic campaign orchestrated by the American Legislative Exchange Council – and funded in part by David and Charles Koch, the billionaire brothers who bankrolled the Tea Party – 38 states introduced legislation this year designed to impede voters at every step of the electoral process.

All told, a dozen states have approved new obstacles to voting. Kansas and Alabama now require would-be voters to provide proof of citizenship before registering. Florida and Texas made it harder for groups like the League of Women Voters to register new voters. Maine repealed Election Day voter registration, which had been on the books since 1973. Five states – Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia – cut short their early voting periods. Florida and Iowa barred all ex-felons from the polls, disenfranchising thousands of previously eligible voters. And six states controlled by Republican governors and legislatures – Alabama, Kansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin – will require voters to produce a government-issued ID before casting ballots. More than 10 percent of U.S. citizens lack such identification, and the numbers are even higher among constituencies that traditionally lean Democratic – including 18 percent of young voters and 25 percent of African-Americans.

Taken together, such measures could significantly dampen the Democratic turnout next year – perhaps enough to shift the outcome in favor of the GOP. “One of the most pervasive political movements going on outside Washington today is the disciplined, passionate, determined effort of Republican governors and legislators to keep most of you from voting next time,” Bill Clinton told a group of student activists in July. “Why is all of this going on? This is not rocket science. They are trying to make the 2012 electorate look more like the 2010 electorate than the 2008 electorate” – a reference to the dominance of the Tea Party last year, compared to the millions of students and minorities who turned out for Obama. “There has never been in my lifetime, since we got rid of the poll tax and all the Jim Crow burdens on voting, the determined effort to limit the franchise that we see today.”

To hear Republicans tell it, they are waging a virtuous campaign to crack down on rampant voter fraud – a curious position for a party that managed to seize control of the White House in 2000 despite having lost the popular vote. After taking power, the Bush administration declared war on voter fraud, making it a “top priority” for federal prosecutors. In 2006, the Justice Department fired two U.S. attorneys who refused to pursue trumped-up cases of voter fraud in New Mexico and Washington, and Karl Rove called illegal voting “an enormous and growing problem.” In parts of America, he told the Republican National Lawyers Association, “we are beginning to look like we have elections like those run in countries where the guys in charge are colonels in mirrored sunglasses.” According to the GOP, community organizers like ACORN were actively recruiting armies of fake voters to misrepresent themselves at the polls and cast illegal ballots for the Democrats.

Even at the time, there was no evidence to back up such outlandish claims. A major probe by the Justice Department between 2002 and 2007 failed to prosecute a single person for going to the polls and impersonating an eligible voter, which the anti-fraud laws are supposedly designed to stop. Out of the 300 million votes cast in that period, federal prosecutors convicted only 86 people for voter fraud – and many of the cases involved immigrants and former felons who were simply unaware of their ineligibility. A much-hyped investigation in Wisconsin, meanwhile, led to the prosecution of only .0007 percent of the local electorate for alleged voter fraud. “Our democracy is under siege from an enemy so small it could be hiding anywhere,” joked Stephen Colbert. A 2007 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a leading advocate for voting rights at the New York University School of Law, quantified the problem in stark terms. “It is more likely that an individual will be struck by lightning,” the report calculated, “than that he will impersonate another voter at the polls.”

GOP outcries over the phantom menace of voter fraud escalated after 2008, when Obama’s candidacy attracted historic numbers of first-time voters. In the 29 states that record party affiliation, roughly two-thirds of new voters registered as Democrats in 2007 and 2008 – and Obama won nearly 70 percent of their votes. In Florida alone, Democrats added more than 600,000 new voters in the run-up to the 2008 election, and those who went to the polls favored Obama over John McCain by 19 points. “This latest flood of attacks on voting rights is a direct shot at the communities that came out in historic numbers for the first time in 2008 and put Obama over the top,” says Tova Wang, an elections-reform expert at Demos, a progressive think tank.

No one has done more to stir up fears about the manufactured threat of voter fraud than Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a top adviser in the Bush Justice Department who has become a rising star in the GOP. “We need a Kris Kobach in every state,” declared Michelle Malkin, the conservative pundit. This year, Kobach successfully fought for a law requiring every Kansan to show proof of citizenship in order to vote – even though the state prosecuted only one case of voter fraud in the past five years. The new restriction fused anti-immigrant hysteria with voter-fraud paranoia. “In Kansas, the illegal registration of alien voters has become pervasive,” Kobach claimed, offering no substantiating evidence.

Kobach also asserted that dead people were casting ballots, singling out a deceased Kansan named Alfred K. Brewer as one such zombie voter. There was only one problem: Brewer was still very much alive. The Wichita Eagle found him working in his front yard. “I don’t think this is heaven,” Brewer told the paper. “Not when I’m raking leaves.”

Kobach might be the gop’s most outspoken crusader working to prevent citizens from voting, but he’s far from the only one. “Voting rights are under attack in America,” Rep. John Lewis, who was brutally beaten in Alabama while marching during the civil rights movement in the 1960s, observed during an impassioned speech on the House floor in July. “There’s a deliberate and systematic attempt to prevent millions of elderly voters, young voters, students, minority and low-income voters from exercising their constitutional right to engage in the democratic process.”

The Republican effort, coordinated and funded at the national level, has focused on disenfranchising voters in four key areas:

Barriers to Registration Since January, six states have introduced legislation to impose new restrictions on voter registration drives run by groups like Rock the Vote and the League of Women Voters. In May, the GOP-controlled legislature in Florida passed a law requiring anyone who signs up new voters to hand in registration forms to the state board of elections within 48 hours of collecting them, and to comply with a barrage of onerous, bureaucratic requirements. Those found to have submitted late forms would face a $1,000 fine, as well as possible felony prosecution.

As a result, the law threatens to turn civic-minded volunteers into inadvertent criminals. Denouncing the legislation as “good old-fashioned voter suppression,” the League of Women Voters announced that it was ending its registration efforts in Florida, where it has been signing up new voters for the past 70 years. Rock the Vote, which helped 2.5 million voters to register in 2008, could soon follow suit. “We’re hoping not to shut down,” says Heather Smith, president of Rock the Vote, “but I can’t say with any certainty that we’ll be able to continue the work we’re doing.”

The registration law took effect one day after it passed, under an emergency statute designed for “an immediate danger to the public health, safety or welfare.” In reality, though, there’s no evidence that registering fake voters is a significant problem in the state. Over the past three years, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement has received just 31 cases of suspected voter fraud, resulting in only three arrests statewide. “No one could give me an example of all this fraud they speak about,” said Mike Fasano, a Republican state senator who bucked his party and voted against the registration law. What’s more, the law serves no useful purpose: Under the Help America Vote Act passed by Congress in 2002, all new voters must show identity before registering to vote.

Cuts to Early Voting After the recount debacle in Florida in 2000, allowing voters to cast their ballots early emerged as a popular bipartisan reform. Early voting not only meant shorter lines on Election Day, it has helped boost turnout in a number of states – the true measure of a successful democracy. “I think it’s great,” Jeb Bush said in 2004. “It’s another reform we added that has helped provide access to the polls and provide a convenience. And we’re going to have a high voter turnout here, and I think that’s wonderful.”

But Republican support for early voting vanished after Obama utilized it as a key part of his strategy in 2008. Nearly 30 percent of the electorate voted early that year, and they favored Obama over McCain by 10 points. The strategy proved especially effective in Florida, where blacks outnumbered whites by two to one among early voters, and in Ohio, where Obama received fewer votes than McCain on Election Day but ended up winning by 263,000 ballots, thanks to his advantage among early voters in urban areas like Cleveland and Columbus.

That may explain why both Florida and Ohio – which now have conservative Republican governors – have dramatically curtailed early voting for 2012. Next year, early voting will be cut from 14 to eight days in Florida and from 35 to 11 days in Ohio, with limited hours on weekends. In addition, both states banned voting on the Sunday before the election – a day when black churches historically mobilize their constituents. Once again, there appears to be nothing to justify the changes other than pure politics. “There is no evidence that any form of convenience voting has led to higher levels of fraud,” reports the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College.

Photo IDs By far the biggest change in election rules for 2012 is the number of states requiring a government-issued photo ID, the most important tactic in the Republican war on voting. In April 2008, the Supreme Court upheld a photo-ID law in Indiana, even though state GOP officials couldn’t provide a single instance of a voter committing the type of fraud the new ID law was supposed to stop. Emboldened by the ruling, Republicans launched a nationwide effort to implement similar barriers to voting in dozens of states.

The campaign was coordinated by the American Legislative Exchange Council, which provided GOP legislators with draft legislation based on Indiana’s ID requirement. In five states that passed such laws in the past year – Kansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin – the measures were sponsored by legislators who are members of ALEC. “We’re seeing the same legislation being proposed state by state by state,” says Smith of Rock the Vote. “And they’re not being shy in any of these places about clearly and blatantly targeting specific demographic groups, including students.”

In Texas, under “emergency” legislation passed by the GOP-dominated legislature and signed by Gov. Rick Perry, a concealed-weapon permit is considered an acceptable ID but a student ID is not. Republicans in Wisconsin, meanwhile, mandated that students can only vote if their IDs include a current address, birth date, signature and two-year expiration date – requirements that no college or university ID in the state currently meets. As a result, 242,000 students in Wisconsin may lack the documentation required to vote next year. “It’s like creating a second class of citizens in terms of who gets to vote,” says Analiese Eicher, a Dane County board supervisor.

The barriers erected in Texas and Wisconsin go beyond what the Supreme Court upheld in Indiana, where 99 percent of state voters possess the requisite IDs and can turn to full-time DMVs in every county to obtain the proper documentation. By contrast, roughly half of all black and Hispanic residents in Wisconsin do not have a driver’s license, and the state staffs barely half as many DMVs as Indiana – a quarter of which are open less than one day a month. To make matters worse, Gov. Scott Walker tried to shut down 16 more DMVs – many of them located in Democratic-leaning areas. In one case, Walker planned to close a DMV in Fort Atkinson, a liberal stronghold, while opening a new office 30 minutes away in the conservative district of Watertown.

Although new ID laws have been approved in seven states, the battle over such barriers to voting has been far more widespread. Since January, Democratic governors in Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire and North Carolina have all vetoed ID laws. Voters in Mississippi and Missouri are slated to consider ballot initiatives requiring voter IDs, and legislation is currently pending in Pennsylvania.

One of the most restrictive laws requiring voter IDs was passed in South Carolina. To obtain the free state ID now required to vote, the 178,000 South Carolinians who currently lack one must pay for a passport or a birth certificate. “It’s the stepsister of the poll tax,” says Browne-Dianis of the Advancement Project. Under the new law, many elderly black residents – who were born at home in the segregated South and never had a birth certificate – must now go to family court to prove their identity. Given that obtaining fake birth certificates is one of the country’s biggest sources of fraud, the new law may actually prompt some voters to illegally procure a birth certificate in order to legally vote – all in the name of combating voter fraud.

For those voters who manage to get a legitimate birth certificate, obtaining a voter ID from the DMV is likely to be hellishly time-consuming. A reporter for the Tri-State Defender in Memphis, Tennessee – another state now mandating voter IDs – recently waited for four hours on a sweltering July day just to see a DMV clerk. The paper found that the longest lines occur in urban precincts, a clear violation of the Voting Rights Act, which bars states from erecting hurdles to voting in minority jurisdictions.

Disenfranchising Ex-Felons The most sweeping tactic in the GOP campaign against voting is simply to make it illegal for certain voters to cast ballots in any election. As the Republican governor of Florida, Charlie Crist restored the voting rights of 154,000 former prisoners who had been convicted of nonviolent crimes. But in March, after only 30 minutes of public debate, Gov. Rick Scott overturned his predecessor’s decision, instantly disenfranchising 97,491 ex-felons and prohibiting another 1.1 million prisoners from being allowed to vote after serving their time.

“Why should we disenfranchise people forever once they’ve paid their price?” Bill Clinton asked during his speech in July. “Because most of them in Florida were African-Americans and Hispanics and would tend to vote for Democrats – that’s why.”

A similar reversal by a Republican governor recently took place in Iowa, where Gov. Terry Branstad overturned his predecessor’s decision to restore voting rights to 100,000 ex-felons. The move threatens to return Iowa to the recent past, when more than five percent of all residents were denied the right to vote – including a third of the state’s black residents. In addition, Florida and Iowa join Kentucky and Virginia as the only states that require all former felons to apply for the right to vote after finishing their prison sentences.

In response to the GOP campaign, voting-rights advocates are scrambling to blunt the impact of the new barriers to voting. The ACLU and other groups are challenging the new laws in court, and congressional Democrats have asked the Justice Department to use its authority to block or modify any of the measures that discriminate against minority voters. “The Justice Department should be much more aggressive in areas covered by the Voting Rights Act,” says Rep. Lewis.

But beyond waging battles at the state and federal level, voting-rights advocates must figure out how to reframe the broader debate. The real problem in American elections is not the myth of voter fraud, but how few people actually participate. Even in 2008, which saw the highest voter turnout in four decades, fewer than two-thirds of eligible voters went to the polls. And according to a study by MIT, 9 million voters were denied an opportunity to cast ballots that year because of problems with their voter registration (13 percent), long lines at the polls (11 percent), uncertainty about the location of their polling place (nine percent) or lack of proper ID (seven percent).

Come Election Day 2012, such problems will only be exacerbated by the flood of new laws implemented by Republicans. Instead of a single fiasco in Florida, experts warn, there could be chaos in a dozen states as voters find themselves barred from the polls. “Our democracy is supposed to be a government by, of and for the people,” says Browne-Dianis. “It doesn’t matter how much money you have, what race you are or where you live in the country – we all get to have the same amount of power by going into the voting booth on Election Day. But those who passed these laws believe that only some people should participate. The restrictions undermine democracy by cutting off the voices of the people.”

But in less than a year as popular actor Aamir Khan said, “All iz well” with the school. It was Aamir Khan who made this school popular through his film 3 Idiots, in which he plays the lovable character Rancho aka Phunsukh Wangdu.



Even though the school was hit by the flash floods on the intervening night of August 5 and 6, the structure remained intact, but the doors and windows were damaged and there was slush inside the classes. Fortunately, all the students and the hostels are doing fine.



Aamir Khan was bowled over by the school when he first visited it in 2008. “What a wonderful school! The kids seem very happy, and such a great location. Keep up the good work,” he wrote in the Visitors’ Diary of the school.



In the film, Rancho’s school is a science school of which Wangdu (Aamir) is the principal.

In reality, it is the Druk White Lotus School located in Shey (ancient capital of Ladakh), close to Leh, the capital of Ladakh, surrounded by the imposing Himalayan mountains and the Sindhu river. It is not just another school, but an exemplary one.



Ever since the film was shot in this location, Aamir Khan has developed a special bond with this school, the students and the people associated with it.



He even rushed to the school when it was hit by the flash floods and ensured that “All iz well” with the school. The students assured him that “All iz well” by singing the song, although much damage was caused to the school buildings due to the floods. Capitalising on its popularity there is also a ‘Rancho Coffee Shop’ in the school premises.



Powered by passion



Come September 24, Rancho’s school will be celebrating its 10th anniversary. For it was on this day that the school was established in 2001 with just 88 students. Locally, the school is also known as Druk Padma Karpo Institute. ‘Druk’ is dragon, ‘Padma’ is lotus and ‘Karpo’ is white in the Ladakhi language.



The school was inspired by the 12th Gyalwang Drukpa, the spiritual head of the 800 year old Drukpa (dragon) lineage. It is named after Mipham Pema Karpo (1527-1592), who is revered as a great scholar.



“There are 619 students of which 281 are residential students from remote areas of Ladakh. Sixty-eight students are orphans of the Leh flood tragedy, while the rest are day scholars,” says Prasad Eledath, Principal of the school.



Hostel facilities allow children from Ladakh’s interior areas to attend the school and a programme of sponsorship makes sure the poorest are not excluded. It is managed by the Druk Pema Karpo Educational Society and funded by international aid.



Prasad Eledath, the real man behind the fictional Phunsukh Wangdu, is a science teacher.

Prasad has a Master’s in Education from University of Sussex in the UK and has turned down lucrative job offers to do something for the people of Ladakh. “The school follows the Jammu and Kashmir syllabus. The students learn English, Hindi, science, creative arts and sports. They also learn the Ladakhi language using Bothi script which is also used for the Tibetan language. The school’s mission is to provide an effective modern education while maintaining the traditional culture of the Ladakh region. Besides, the students also team work and presentation skills through formal and co-curricular activities,” says Eledath.



The school has won numerous awards for its architecture, including the best green architecture award, the most environment-friendly building and also the best architecture design award.



Gyalwang Drukpa, the spiritual head of the Ladakhi people, has plans to open more such schools in the Himalayan region. A branch school opened in Khachhey in April 2010.

60,60,FL-2011-000139-CHN,Poll: Many Americans uncomfortable with Muslims - CNN,https://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/06/poll-many-americans-uncomfortable-with-muslims/,"By Eric Marrapodi, CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor

Washington (CNN) - Ten years after 9/11, Americans are wrestling with their opinions of Muslims, a new survey found, and where Americans get their TV news is playing a role in those opinions.

Nearly half of Americans would be uncomfortable with a woman wearing a burqa, a mosque being built in their neighborhood or Muslim men praying at an airport. Forty-one percent would be uncomfortable if a teacher at the elementary school in their community were Muslim.

Forty-seven percent of survey respondents said the values of Islam are at odds with American values.

The Public Religion Research Institute conducted the survey and issued a report in conjunction with the Brookings Institution, ""What it Means to be American: Attitudes in an Increasingly Diverse America 10 Years after 9/11.""

“Americans are wrestling with fear, but on the other hand they're also wrestling with acceptance,” said Robert P. Jones, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute.

The results of the survey were announced Tuesday at the Brookings Institution in Washington.

One issue that seemed to divide respondents was sharia law.

Overall, 61% of respondents disagreed that Muslims want to establish sharia law in the U.S.

""2011 has been an enormously active year for this question,"" Jones said. ""Forty-nine bills have been introduced in 29 states to ban sharia law. We asked the same question back in February, and only 23% of Americans agreed Muslims want to establish sharia as the law of the land. That number has gone up to 30%, so still a minority, but the minority has grown.""

The numbers were also showed a correlation with where people went for their news.

Of Americans who say they trust Fox News the most for their television news, 52% believe that Muslims are trying to establish sharia law in the United States. Sixty-eight percent of Fox viewers believed the values of Islam were at odds with American values.

The report says fewer than one-third of Americans who most trust broadcast news, CNN (20%) and public television (23%) believe that Muslims are trying to establish sharia.

""It's an emotional roller coaster,"" said Dr. Muqtedar Khan, a professor of political science at the University of Delaware. ""I looked at this survey, and I'm really depressed.""

Khan, a practicing Muslim, was particularly disturbed by the attitudes toward Muslims and what he called a misunderstanding of sharia law. ""Sharia is just a prop, an attempt to say, 'we just don't know and like Muslims.' ""

The survey also found strong support of religious liberty and tolerance.

Eighty-eight percent of those contacted by pollsters agreed that ""America was founded on the idea of religious freedom for everyone, including religious groups that are unpopular.""

One year after a Florida pastor burned a copy of the Quran, 95% of people polled said religious books should be treated with respect.

And two-thirds of those polled said there should be strict separation between church and state.

According to Jones, 2,450 Americans were reached by phone for the survey, and it had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.","Tue, 06 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/09/06/t1larg.muslimprayers.jpg,"['respondents', 'survey', 'religious', 'poll', 'uncomfortable', 'wrestling', 'public', 'muslims', 'sharia', 'establish', 'americans', 'law']",

He presses his finger against the trigger when anyone bangs loudly on the metal to enter the Stad Sylvio Cator in downtown Port au Prince, pulling the door slowly open and gingerly peering his head out to see who it is.

Usually they are met with a firm volley of abuse in Creole, but this time it is the guests he has been expecting.

The Haitian national football team bus has arrived for training the day before one of the most important matches in the team's history: a 2014 World Cup qualifier against the minnows of the U.S. Virgin Islands.

It is also the country's first home football match since as many as 300,000 people were killed when a massive 7.0 earthquake reduced much of the city to rubble.

""It's 46 degrees on the pitch, we just measured it,"" lamented the team's Brazilian coach Edson Tavares. It is three in the afternoon, the same time the match is due to be played 24-hours later.

""It's crazy. FIFA [football's world governing body] agreed to move the match to this time. CONCACAF [the governing body for the Caribbean] said no. What do they know? They work out of New York and know nothing about the heat in the Caribbean.""

But the change in time was a necessity as much for the Haitians as anyone else. Electricity is scarce in the city, too scarce for the expensive but impotent flood lights that had been installed.

Soccer salvation: How Haiti is healing after its earthquake

Haitian football, like virtually every aspect of Haitian society, was almost terminally injured when the earthquake hit in January 2010.

The Haitian Football Federation's headquarters were leveled, killing more than 30 of its staff. Its president, Yves Jean Bart, was one of only two survivors.

The stadium itself had become, like any other scrap of spare space in Port au Prince, a makeshift camp.

Hundreds of families lived here until being moved out in July when a new pitch was laid. A torn blue ribbon of despair still surrounds it.

Workers busily paint the steps inside blue, yellow and red -- the colors of the Haitian flag -- to erase the memory of its temporary incarnation.

The smell is of paint, excrement from the nearby open sewers and burning trash. The HFF president, knowing that the game has such a place in Haiti's heart, went on to rebuild the federation and hired Tavares to achieve the dream of emulating Haiti's golden generation who qualified for the 1974 World Cup.

""My first impression was to take my flight back to Brazil,"" Tavares explains a few hours before traveling to the stadium.

""The country was completely devastated. Today is a paradise compared. If you compare with last year ... you could be walking the street and find the [severed] legs of people, the arms of people.""

Tavares began by paying for his own flight to Europe, where he hired a car and visited the professional players of Haitian descent who play on the continent.

""I rented a car to travel to five countries to persuade the players to play for his original country. Only one refused. We contacted 20 players. And they are here. Most of them don't speak Creole. One only speaks Italian. One only German.""

The squad for the U.S. Virgin Islands' game was full of talented new professionals gleaned from the diaspora, like Jean-Eudes Maurice who is on Paris Saint-Germain's books and goalkeeper Steward Ceus, a New Yorker born and raised who plays for the Colorado Rapids.

""I was in college when I heard a buzz about Haiti being interested in seeing me,"" explains Ceus, whose grandmother used to be a baker for the former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

Soccer storm in the Caribbean: How diplomacy faltered over football

""Coming here left me speechless. The fans come after training, before training, crowding around the bus. My passion for soccer has always been there and I always wished that the people around me shared that passion. For the first time I found the passion I've been looking for.""

Yet sometimes passion isn't enough and Tavares hopes that the professionalism of his new team will rub off on the local players, who he believes are some of the most talented in the world.

""I have never seen a country with so many talents as here,"" he says. ""If you put these guys in Manchester United and Barcelona, they would be great player[s]. The problem is to be a great player you need good food and a good environment. Here is nothing.""

On the morning of the match the country's president Michel Martelly, a former singer known as ""Sweet Micky"", arrives to meet the players. He shakes each by the hand, presents them with a flag and sings the national anthem together.

""I believe there's a new movement. There's a new will to show a new face of Haiti,"" he says.

""Haiti is ready to show that new face. In the past we talk about our problems and issues. But today is a chance to prove that today Haiti can be a great nation and can be victorious. I couldn't express in words what Haiti would be like if ... when, not if, we qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.""

As kick off approaches 10,000 Haitians, maybe more, try and fail to crush through the single open door into the stadium at the same time. A police blockade had been thrown around the stadium.

Creole rap music is played at ear-splitting level. The crowd push forward in the hope of getting in, the police use shields and clubs to beat them back.

It's chaos, but such is the passion for football in Haiti, that a match against a tiny team like the U.S. Virgin Islands brings the country to a standstill.

""I am very happy, we will have our victory. This will be a victory for all of Haiti,"" explains Johnny, a 28-year-old engineer and translator waiting in line behind the crowd, which had by now threatened to get out of control.

But then the rain comes, just in time to dampen the anger as the fans run to take cover. ""Life is very hard here,"" Johnny adds.

""With God everything is possible. But this is the reason why football can change something. I hope Haiti scores ten goals."" Haiti tear the U.S. Virgin Islands apart.

Six goals are scored, the post is hit three times, sending the crowd delirious. Ceus is a virtual spectator until the final whistle. ""I did touch the ball once,"" he says with a wink as he comes off the pitch.

""But not with my hands."" There is a long way to go. Tougher tests lie ahead. On Tuesday they play Curacao. Next, perhaps Jamaica or Mexico or the dream ticket: USA.

But, for now, Les Grenadiers brought something to Haiti that has been in short supply for so long: hope.

""I feel so happy to see what happened in the country and to see all the Haitians come to the game. It was incredible,"" says James Marcelin, the Portland Timbers player who scored in the rout.

""We only have one thing left, and that's football. You can play and all the world is watching you. The flag can fly everywhere because of football. It's the one thing that people live for now.""","Tue, 06 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/SPORT/football/09/06/football.haiti.world.cup/haiti.tzvids.jpg,"['match', 'tavares', 'football', 'cup', 'dream', 'world', 'soccers', 'qualifying', 'quake', 'country', 'haitian', 'passion', 'virgin', 'haiti', 'players']",

""We are constantly coming up with projects to raise money so that the museum can have exhibitions and be a lively museum,” said Cecilia Barbara de Moctezuma, president of the Association of Friends for the Museum of Popular Art. “Our president was in Miami attending an auction where a car decorated with little mirrors got a lot of interest and was auctioned at a very good price. When she came back to Mexico, she proposed us to come up with ideas on something that was 100 percent Mexican. So to largely promote the work of the Huichol Indians to the world, we chose to decorate a Volkswagen.""

The beads were applied to the car body with polymer glue and it took the father and daughter team eight months to complete the project. After a multiple city tour throughout Mexico this year, the Beaded VW Beetle will tour selected key cities in the United States and Europe during 2012.

The prestigious Smithsonian Institute will be among their U.S. stops. ""We are also talking to museums in Los Angeles, San Diego and possibly Atlanta,” de Moctezuma said. “Sometime in 2012 we plan to bring the car to Paris, Berlin, and we'll see about also going to London and Madrid.""

Francisco Bautista, one of the Huichol Indians involved in the beading of the Volkswagen Beetle, explains the symbolism of the design motifs on the Beaded VW Beetle, which not only cover the exterior of the car, but the steering wheel, dashboard and even the seats, too, as follows:

• An eagle contained in the many images on the Beaded VW Beetle represents the mode of communication between gods and humans.

• A reindeer’s head and the jicori or sacred cactus represents wisdom and knowledge, offerings to the Huichol elder brother of knowledge.

• The Sun drawn on the headliner of the car is the Huichol grandfather of fire, one of the four cardinal points representing the four elements – water, earth, air, and fire.

• On the backside of the Beaded VW Beetle a flood scene represents the element of water. An Ark features a person, dog and reindeer’s head at the front of the boat. Over the boat a cloud represents Nacahue, mother of all the gods and Mother Nature herself, who caused the flood.

• The Huicholes from Nayarit designed one side of the car in Huichol text celebrating the bicentennial of Mexican Independence.

• Even the tires of the Beaded VW Beetle include symbolism – a two-headed eagle that in Huichol culture means it perceives on two levels. The tires also have designs of the jicori and scorpions that represent the guardians of grandfather Sun.

Preserving and Promoting the Huichol Culture

""I would like to call Mexicans to appreciate further the value of the art we bring, and to start promoting our Wixarika culture, to recognize it, to know about it, and to value and respect our sacred places that have been there for many centuries that we have maintained throughout many years,"" Baustista said. ""We represent the maximum expression to our municipality, our state, as well as our country""

The Beaded VW Beetle also represents the wonderful textiles and crafts of the Huichol women. Bautista's daughter, who decorated the top front section of the car, told MexicoToday , ""I am very proud to be part of this project because it is something that will transcend to the world, and we will be known internationally. Even more so as a woman as many times we are often not recognized for the work we do. It is what I really love doing. It is something I gladly do with a lot of respect to my culture precisely because I like it and I would like people from abroad to like it as well,"" she added.

""We were pleasantly surprised that the Huichol Indians are very spiritual, and they decided to include the cosmology on how they see the world, how they think, all the animals that are part of their lives, and the symbolism into the beaded car,” added de Moctezuma.

The Beaded VW Beetle car is an example of the way the Museum of Popular Art supports and promotes popular arts and crafts, raising awareness about the value it brings to contemporary designs for Mexicans, people abroad and to universal culture.

""One of the goals of the Museum of Popular Art is to preserve traditions, the intrinsic relationship between biodiversity and crafts, as well as promote new projects for artisans and for craftsmen in our country"" said Walther Boelsterly, the museum's director. ""The artisans from Nayarit and Jalisco have been carrying the pre-Hispanic culture through the generations of their regions, carrying with them the biodiversity from their region and transferring those images into their artisan tools, and how those tools have an intrinsic aesthetic and design, and how these shapes and colors are brought into contemporary designs and arts.""","Tue, 06 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.torquenews.com/sites/default/files/image-397/%5Btitle-raw%5D/beadedvwbeetle.jpg,"['represents', 'popular', 'culture', 'museum', 'european', 'vw', 'museums', 'art', 'huichol', 'tour', 'beaded', 'car', 'beetle']",

The foundation of humanity’s food supply is crumbling.The United Nations now estimates that more than 20 per cent of the Earth’s cultivated soils have been significantly degraded, while in the United States, 28 per cent of cropland is eroding at an unsustainable rate. Research shows that of all human activities, agriculture is the biggest threat to biodiversity and ecosystems.

Solving agriculture’s many problems is not impossible, but the issues involved are complex and the necessary transformations radical. To discuss them is to risk frightening or confusing people. On the other hand, everyone likes good food. So campaigns for more ecologically sound farming practices, especially in the wealthier nations, too often seem to suggest to consumers that with enough effort, we can simply eat our way to a sustainable future.

For example, Organic Valley, the United States’ largest organic-farming cooperative, suggests that “personal food choices affect the health of our bodies and our planet, and drive their future”. Likewise, the British Soil Association says that “the buying decisions we make every day are a simple but powerful form of direct action”, and Naturalnews.com stresses that “by changing what you buy, you change what farmers will grow and how they will grow it”.

But to trust that our personal food-shopping decisions or gardening prowess can push the global food system towards sustainability – to vote three times a day with our forks, as writer Michael Pollan has urged – is to assume that the global agricultural economy operates by the same neighbourly rules that prevail down at the local farmers’ market.

It doesn’t. Eating well-produced food will improve our own health, but not necessarily the health of the Earth’s soils. On the 1.5 billion hectares of cropland around the globe where our staple foods are grown, the profits of agribusiness and the corporate food industry always get fed first.

Those profits depend primarily on a flood of cheap grain, produce, meat, and milk made possible by the exploitation of soil and human labour. And in the past few decades, a variety of industries – heavy equipment, chemicals, food processing, packaging, transport, advertising, restaurant chains, and others – have grown as appendages on agriculture. In the United States, the dollar outputs of those food-related industries are expanding at two to four times the rate of farming’s output. That is creating even more powerful constituencies for policies and practices that turn soil into profit.

Working at it as hard as we can, all of us together cannot chew and swallow enough food to change those corporate priorities. The transformation has to be achieved in practice out on the land, not by depending on the same kinds of supply and demand curves that got us into this mess. After two decades of favourable publicity, growing customer enthusiasm, and rapid market expansion, certified organic food still accounts for only 0.7 per cent of US cropland and 0.5 per cent of range and pasture land.

Every country has its own domestic and global obstacles to overcome. To roll back the damage being done to the United States’ agricultural landscapes, for example, would require passage of bold legislation that challenges entrenched economic interests head on; consequently, the task is often viewed as impossible, but that makes it no less urgent.

Immediately necessary actions include abolishing commodity subsides; paying farmers serious money to conserve land and water; banning toxic chemicals, factory farming of livestock, and industrial mega-dairies; and putting a halt to the cultivation of hundreds of thousands of square kilometres of maize, soybean, and sorghum crops for supplying the livestock, sweetener, and biofuel industries. In addition, we must stop exporting cheap wheat and other grains that wreck local markets for family farmers in other countries, and we must stop importing products that distort economies and ruin landscapes around the world.

To do all of that is an ambitious undertaking, to say the least. But those changes are just the beginning of what is needed.

Working with nature

We can correct those problems that are created by industrial forces over the past century, but that won’t fix another, much more fundamental problem that has been plaguing farmers now for a hundred centuries: the dependence of agriculture on annual plants, typically in monoculture.

Before humans invented agriculture, 95 per cent of the Earth’s ice-free surface was covered by diverse mixtures of perennial plants: forests, prairies, wetlands, et cetera. Today, nearly 40 per cent of that land is devoted to agriculture, most of it sown to uniform stands of annual crops that die each season after harvest and must be re-sown.

That “clearcutting” at the soil surface and regular die-out of the roots below makes it impossible for healthy, durable, resilient ecosystems to become established either above or below the surface. Soil erosion, water contamination, and biodiversity loss are the inevitable result.

Landscapes can be compelled to produce harvests of annual monocultures for years or decades, sometimes centuries, but it requires hauling in nutrients, churning the soil, killing weeds, battling pests, and in many places irrigating. And even those heroic efforts cannot sustain soils in the long term.

Since early cultivators first domesticated wheat and barley in the Middle East ten thousand years ago, farmers everywhere have struggled and often failed to compensate for the built-in vulnerabilities of annual crops and monocultures. And as things stand, with 7 billion human beings needing to eat every day and global per-capita food production continuing to decline, we have no choice but to do the best we can in the short term with a combination of conventional and more sustainable agricultural systems incorporating annual crop plants.

As we are keeping our fingers in the dike, so to speak, we also need to begin developing the methods of a new, more resilient agriculture by using the highly integrated diversity of natural ecosystems as a model. But that model and those methods can’t be brought to the farm as long as we are dependent on annual crops and clearcutting. First, we will have to develop perennial grain crops through breeding.

The annual grain crops that perennials will replace now occupy three-fourths of the world’s cropland. Consumer campaigns promoting more eco-friendly food tend to feature fresh produce, sometimes exclusively. That makes sense in a way. Corporate production of fruits and vegetables is especially hard on human workers, ecosystems, and the atmosphere. But those foods account for less than seven per cent of US cropland, and a similar share worldwide. Even if we all ate as much of those foods as we should, the bulk of agricultural soils would still be covered, as they are today, by crops of cereals, grain legumes, and oilseeds, not carrots or cucumbers. To save those soils in the long term, we will need perennial counterparts to those staple crops.

In the past few years, plant breeders, geneticists, ecologists, and agronomists in the United States, Canada, China, Nepal, and Australia have begun developing perennial versions of wheat, rice, sorghum, sunflower, and other major grain crops, along with ecologically sound, multispecies cropping systems in which to grow them. The goal is to replace annual grain monocultures worldwide with polycultures of perennial grains and other perennial species. That will require, as a first step, a rapid expansion of such breeding efforts.

The transformation of agriculture, therefore, will require two parallel efforts, one aimed at putting a halt to the ravages of industrial farming and the other at developing the perennial farm ecosystems of the future. Eating better food is not the way to ensure that those efforts succeed, but it will be the result.

Miss Bartz, who was axed by phone, has had a rocky tenure lasting nearly three years punctuated by stagnating growth and a bitter row with one of the firm's Chinese partners.



The 63-year-old CEO, who was hired despite a lack of internet or advertising experience, told Yahoo employees that she was fired by Yahoo's chairman of the board, Roy Bostock.

Rocky road: Carol Bartz has had three years in charge punctuated by stagnating growth and a bitter row with one of the firm's Chinese partners

Most recently, Yahoo have settled a payment dispute with China's Alibaba Group, in which Yahoo holds a 40 per cent stake.



Miss Bartz has also had to watch as Yahoo loses further ground as an internet domain to all-conquering Google, while also facing strong competition from other social networks like Facebook.



She announced her departure to employees via a two-sentence email from her iPad which read: 'I am very sad to tell you that I've just been fired over the phone by Yahoo's Chairman of the Board.



'It has been my pleasure to work with all of you and I wish you only the best going forward.'





The California-based company has appointed chief financial officer Timothy Morse as CEO on an interim basis, but plans to search for a permanent replacement for Miss Bartz.

At its peak in 2000, Yahoo shares traded for $125. Last night they closed at $12.91.

Yahoo lost further ground in the race against Google during Miss Bartz's tenure, despite actually making more money through layoffs, service closures and other cost-cutting moves.

Last year Yahoo's revenue edged up by just two per cent in the first nine months of the year, while Google's climbed by 23 per cent in the same period.

In April the same year, the straight-talking boss candidly admitted that she 'could have done better' in her job, by which time speculation around her position was already growing.



Facebook has also become another serious competitor for Yahoo by attracting the major marketing partners which once went to Yahoo during the dotcom boom in 2000.



A TROUBLED TENURE

Jan '09: Bartz appointed Yahoo CEO, replacing co-founder Jerry Yang, who resigned under pressure from investors after rejecting a Microsoft takeover bid .

July '09: Yahoo and Microsoft seal ten-year search engine merger deal in attempt to rival Google.

April 2010: Bartz admits she, along with 100 other executives at Yahoo, 'could have done better' .

Sept 2010: Yahoo's revenue growth for first nine months of year is 11 times less than that of Google.

Dec 2010: The firm's poor financial growth forces Bartz to lay off between 600 and 700 employees .

Feb 2011: Yahoo is valued at around $22.11bn, while Google is worth $169.38bn.

May 2011: Row between Yahoo and Chinese partner Alibaba sees U.S. firm lose part of its 40 per stake in Asian company.

The firm was forced to lay off more than 600 staff - around five per cent of its workforce - last year due to lacklustre growth.



The departure was first reported by the Wall Street Journal's All Things D technology blog.



Yahoo shares jumped 74 cents, or 5.7 per cent, to $13.65 in after-hours trading, around 12 per cent higher than they were when Miss Bartz was named chief executive.

In recent months speculation has mounted over various companies wanting to either take over Yahoo or invest and split into parts.

News Corp, AT&T, and Verizon had all been linked with a move to buy the firm out, with Yahoo's cooperation.

Miss Bartz had joined Yahoo as the firm's CEO after 17 years at design software company Autodesk.



Roy Bostock, chairman of the Yahoo board, had publicly backed Bartz earlier this year, but has since decided to let her go after the firm posted more disappointing financial results.

Mr Bostock said: 'The board sees enormous growth opportunities on which Yahoo! can capitalize, and our primary objective is to leverage the Company's leadership and current business assets and platforms to execute against these opportunities.



'We have talented teams and tremendous resources behind them and intend to return the Company to a path of robust growth and industry-leading innovation.'

Mr Bostock also thanked Miss Bartz for her service to Yahoo during 'a critical time of transition in the company's history, and against a very challenging macro-economic backdrop'.



Mr Morse said: 'It is an honor to be selected for this role and lead the Company with this world-class team of executives.

69,69,FL-2011-000139-CHN,Gaddafi ‘ready to negotiate’ with rebels - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2011/8/28/gaddafi-ready-to-negotiate-with-rebels,"Toppled leader is still in Libya and ready to negotiate forming a transitional government, according to his spokesman.

Muammar Gaddafi is ready to discuss a transition of power to be negotiated by his son, al-Saadi, sources have told Al Jazeera as rebels continued to push towards the toppled Libyan leader’s hometown of Sirte.

Moussa Ibrahim, Gaddafi’s spokesman, earlier told the Associated Press news agency in a phone call that Gaddafi was still in Libya and prepared to discuss the formation of a transitional government.

Ibrahim has been the most public face of the Gaddafi government in recent weeks, regularly addressing television cameras and journalists in Tripoli.

The phone call appears to represent a change of policy by Gaddafi who last week referred to the rebels as “thugs” and “rats” and urged loyalists to continue fighting even as his opponents seized control of Tripoli.

But a top official in the National Transition Council (NTC) told Reuters news agency that Libya’s rebel government would not negotiate with Gaddafi unless he surrendered.

“No negotiation is taking place with Gaddafi,” Ali Tarhouni, the NTC official in charge of oil and financial matters said.

Gaddafi’s whereabouts remains unknown and rebels have offered a reward for his capture or killing.

Al Jazeera’s correspondent James Bays reporting from Tripoli said: “the hunt for him [Gaddafi] goes on and one of the places that is still in the hands of Gaddafi forces is his hometown of Sirte.”

Sirte is considered the last remaining bastion of support for the man whose decades-long rule of Libya is effectively over, with the rebel NTC now widely recognised as the country’s legitimate government.

On Saturday the Arab League became the latest international body to recognise the NTC as it turned over the country’s seat in the regional bloc to the rebel leadership.

Rebels claimed victory in Bin Jawad late on Saturday, advancing in their push towards Sirte.

Reporting from the city, Al Jazeera’s Jacky Rowland said: “If, in fact, it is proven that the rebels are able to hold the town of Bin Jawad, then certainly they will have removed a major obstacle on the way to Sirte.”

Mustafa Abdel Jalil, chairman of the NTC, said at a news conference on Saturday that rebel commanders were negotiating with Gaddafi loyalists in Bin Jawad to try to persuade them to surrender control over the city.

Vital supply route

Tunisian authorities have opened the main border crossing into Libya, Reuters reported on Sunday.

The opening of the border came after Libyan rebels defeated Gaddafi loyalists in skirmishes over a key border checkpoint with Tunisia, this is going to be a vital supply route into the war-ravaged country.

Gaining control of the Ras Ajdir crossing allows rebels to channel fresh supplies and aid to Tripoli, amid fears of a developing humanitarian crisis in the capital and elsewhere.

Al Jazeera’s Sue Turton, reporting from Tripoli on Saturday, said the capture was an “incredibly important” gain for the rebels.

Tripoli faces severe water shortage

“It shows that they are managing to get rid of what is left of Gaddafi troops in that area, but more importantly it opens a supply route across from the west into Tripoli,” she said.

In the capital, rebels were consolidating their control on Saturday, but the United Nations said security remained a key concern, with fears of reprisal attacks in a country now awash with small arms.

Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, also called on the international community to work together to restore order in Libya and for the fighting to end.

Following a UN meeting in New York, Ban said there was a “urgent need to put an end to the conflict and restore order and stability”.

The nearly week-long fighting in Tripoli has left hospitals struggling to cope with the flood of wounded as supplies run scarce.

“Many of the residents in Tripoli have now run out of water, they need electricity to pump the water around the city and the electricity pumps have been hit,” Al Jazeera’s Turton reported on Saturday.","Sun, 28 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/20118286513453734_20.jpeg?fit=680%2C450,"['negotiate', 'libya', 'told', 'control', 'rebels', 'ntc', 'gaddafi', 'tripoli', 'water', 'ready', 'rebel', 'jazeeras']", 
70,70,FL-2011-000139-CHN,Four ways 9/11 changed America's attitude toward religion - CNN,https://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/03/four-ways-911-changed-americas-attitude-toward-religion/,"By John Blake, CNN

(CNN) - David O'Brien couldn't help himself. After the September 11 terrorist attacks, he became obsessed.

O'Brien read the stories of 9/11 victims over and over, stunned by what he was discovering.

He read about the firefighters who marched up the smoke-choked stairwells of the World Trade Center, though many knew they could die; the beloved priest killed while giving last rites as the twin towers collapsed; the passengers on hijacked planes who called their families one last time to say, ""I love you.""

""I was obsessed with these stories,"" says O'Brien, a Catholic historian at the University of Dayton in Ohio. ""There were so many stories of self-sacrifice, not just by the first responders, but by people fleeing the building. There was this revelation of goodness.""

O'Brien saw an Easter message in 9/11 - good rising out of the ashes of evil. Yet there were other religious messages sent that day, and afterward, that are more troubling, religious leaders and scholars say.

September 11 didn't just change America, they say. It changed the nation's attitude toward religion. Here are four ways:

1: A chosen nation becomes a humbled one.

One man died because he arrived early to work. A woman died because she decided to take a later flight. The arbitrary nature of some of the deaths on 9/11 still sticks with many Americans today.

Yet this is what life is like for billions of people on the planet today, some religious leaders say. A random event - a car bomb, a stray bullet - can end their lives at any minute.

Most Americans had not lived with this vulnerability until 9/11, says Mathew Schmalz, a religion professor at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts, who once lived in Karachi, Pakistan.

""We had this sense of specialness and invulnerability that 9/11 shattered,"" he says. ""Given that a large section of the world's population deals with random violence every day, one of the outcomes of 9/11 should be a greater feeling of solidarity with people who live in cities like Karachi in which violence is a part of everyday life.""

Recognizing that vulnerability, though, is difficult for some Americans because of how they see their country, Schmalz and others say.

They say Americans have long had a triumphalist view of their place in history. Certain beliefs have been engrained: Tomorrow will always be better; we're number one. The term ""American"" even reflects a certain arrogance. It casually discounts millions of people living in Central and Latin America.

The 9/11 attacks, though, forced many Americans to confront their limitations, says Rev. Thomas Long, a nationally known pastor who has been active in post 9/11 interfaith efforts.

""We're losing the power of the American empire and becoming more a nation among nations,"" says Long, a religion professor at Emory University in Atlanta. ""The world is a much more dangerous and fragile place economically.""

How Americans cope with their loss of power is ultimately a theological question, Long says. It's the same question the ancient Hebrews confronted in the Old and New Testaments when they faced national calamities.

The chosen people had to learn how to be humble people, Long says. Americans face the same test today.

""The challenge for every faith tradition is going to be helping people grieve the loss of an image of America that they once had,"" he says, ""and acquire a modern understanding of ourselves on the world's stage.""

2: The re-emergence of ""Christo-Americanism.""

Before 9/11, if you asked the average American about Ramadan or sharia law, they probably would have given you a blank look.

Not anymore. The 9/11 attacks prompted more Americans to learn about Islam. Books on the subject became best-sellers. Colleges started offering more courses on Islam. Every cable news show suddenly had their stable of ""Muslim experts.""

More Americans know about Islam than ever before, but that hasn't stopped the post-9/11 Muslim backlash. The outrage over plans to build an Islamic prayer and community center near ground zero; the pastor who threatened to burn the Quran; conservative Christian leaders who called Islam evil - all occurred as knowledge of Islam spread throughout America, scholars says.

""One of the sobering lessons of the decade since 9/11 is that religious prejudice is not always rooted in raw ignorance,"" says Thomas Kidd, author of ""American Christians and Islam.""

""Some of America's most vociferous anti-Muslim critics know quite a lot about Muslim beliefs, but they often use their knowledge to construe Islam in the worst possible light.""

Many of these public attacks against Islam were encouraged by conservative Christian leaders such as Rev. Franklin Graham, the son of Rev. Billy Graham, who called Islam ""wicked,"" and Pat Robertson, the Christian broadcaster who declared that ""Islam is not a religion,"" says Charles Kammer, a religion professor at the College of Wooster in Ohio.

Kammer says Graham and Robertson helped fuel the rise of ""Christo-Americanism,"" a distorted form of Christianity that blends nationalism, conservative paranoia and Christian rhetoric.

""A segment of the religious community in the United States has been at the forefront of an anti-Islamic crusade that has helped to generate a climate of hatred and distrust toward all Muslims,"" says Kammer.

Other strains of Christo-Americanism have swept through America before.

After 9/11, some political leaders said terrorists hated the U.S. because of ""our freedoms."" But America's record on granting those freedoms to its citizens is mixed, says Lynn Neal, co-editor of the book, ""Religious Intolerance in America.""

In the 19th century, the U.S government passed numerous laws preventing Native American tribes from practicing their religion. Mormons were persecuted. Roman Catholics were once described as disloyal, sexual deviants, Neal says.

""Religious intolerance is not a new feature of the American landscape. Despite being the most religiously diverse nation on earth, despite having a first amendment that protects religious rights...we as a nation and as citizens have often failed to live up to those ideas.""

3: Interfaith becomes cool.

Interfaith dialogue - it's not the type of term that makes the heart beat faster.

Before 9/11, interfaith efforts were dismissed as feel-good affairs that rarely got media coverage. The 9/11 attacks changed that.

Interfaith events spread across the country. Mosques and temples held joint worship services. Every college campus seemed to have an interfaith dialogue. The Obama White House launched a college interfaith program.

Becoming an interfaith leader is now hip, some say.

""A generation of students is saying that they want to be interfaith leaders, just like previous generations said they wanted to be human rights activists or environmentalists,"" says Eboo Patel, who founded the Interfaith Youth Core in 2002.

Patel says at least 250 colleges have signed up for the White House interfaith program, which he helped design. The program encourages students of different faiths to work together on service projects.

""These young leaders will make interfaith cooperation a social norm in America, similar to multiculturalism and volunteerism,"" Patel says.

These new leaders include people like Sarrah Shahawy, a Muslim-American medical student at Harvard University and the daughter of Egyptian immigrants.

After 9/11, Shahawy says she felt the responsibility to educate people about Islam. She became an interfaith leader at the University of Southern California, where she noticed a steady increase in student participation in the years after the attacks.

Shahawy says her generation is drawn to interfaith efforts because 9/11 showed the destructive potential of any exclusive claims to religious truth. The 9/11 hijackers carried out their attacks in the name of Islam, but Muslim religious leaders and scholars said that the terrorists' actions did not reflect Islamic teachings.

""For one religious group to claim a monopoly on truth should be obsolete,"" she says. The interfaith movement doesn't teach people that all religions are the same, she says.

Shahawy calls herself a proud Muslim. ""But for me, there's beauty and truth to be found in many different religions.""

4: Atheists come out of the closet.

There's one group, however, that sees little beauty in any religion.

Before 9/11, many atheists kept a low profile. Something changed, though, after 9/11. They got loud.

Atheist leaders such as Richard Dawkins, author of ""The God Delusion,"" and Sam Harris, author of ""The End of Faith,"" wrote best-selling books. Atheist groups launched national media campaigns with bold billboard messages such as ""Christmas is a myth.""

The pugnacious journalist Christopher Hitchens became the public face of a more combative form of atheism as he went on talk shows and lectures to defend not believing in God.

Criticism of all religion, not just fanatical cults, was no longer taboo after 9/11, says Daniel Dennett, a philosophy professor with Tufts University in Massachusetts.

""Atheist-bashing is now, like gay-bashing, no longer an activity that can be indulged in with impunity by politicians or commentators,"" Dennett says.

Atheists were driven to become more vocal because of the 9/11 attacks and America's reaction, says David Silverman, president of American Atheists. He says many atheists were disgusted when President George W. Bush and leaders in the religious right reacted to the attack by invoking ""God is on our side"" rhetoric while launching a ""war on terror.""

They adopted one form of religious extremism while condemning another, he says.

""It really showed atheists why religion should not be in power. Religion is dangerous, even our own religion,"" Silverman says.

Atheists are still the most disparaged group in America, but there's less stigma attached to being one, he says.

""The more noise that we make, the easier it us to accept us,"" Silverman says. ""Most people know atheists now. They knew them before, but didn't know they were atheists.""

Many Americans knew the people who perished on 9/11 as well, but they didn't know they were heroes until later, says David O'Brien, the Catholic historian who compulsively read the 9/11 obituaries.

O'Brien was so moved by the stories he read that he decided to write an essay for America magazine, a national Catholic weekly, entitled, ""9/11 Then and Now.""

He wrote: On 9/11, ""Our people, my people, were tested and, for a shining moment ... they were found worthy.""

He said many 9/11 victims didn't panic as their end drew near. They ""thought not of themselves, but others ... when the chips were down."" They saw themselves not as individuals, but as members of a ""single human family.""

So should we, he says, as we face new challenges 10 years later. The 9/11 victims aren't just heroes; they're our guides for the future, he says.

""The story is not over, not by a long shot,"" O'Brien wrote. ""Look at all the love that day. Love can still write another chapter and keep hope alive for a better future. The meaning of 9/11 lies ahead, and it's in our hands, and maybe in our hearts.'","Sat, 03 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/09/02/t1larg.911faith.jpg,"['american', 'americas', 'americans', 'america', 'religious', 'attitude', 'ways', 'attacks', 'religion', 'interfaith', 'leaders', 'islam', 'changed', '911']", 
71,71,FL-2011-000139-CHN,The CIA's Islamist Cover Up | by Ian Johnson - The New York Review of Books,https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2011/08/30/cia-islamist-cover-up/,"AP Photo/Ben Curtis Members of the Muslim Brotherhood outside a Cairo court, February 2007. Internal CIA documents describe the movement as a potential ally against Islamist terrorism.

The tenth anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington will be accompanied by the usual solemn political pronouncements and predictable media retrospectives. Pundits will point out that the West’s own economic mismanagement of the past decade has done more to weaken Europe and North America than the Islamists’ attacks. Some others will note how radical Islamists are still strong in Afghanistan and point to the recent downing of a military helicopter with dozens of US troops dead. Still others will use the anniversary to pontificate on how our concerns about Islamism have given racists an excuse to tarnish an entire religion. We will also hear about how the democratic uprisings in the Arab world—Libya being the latest—have undermined Islamists (by providing the region’s disgruntled masses with examples of positive, instead of destructive change).

All of these points are well and good and worth hearing again. But they shouldn’t distract us from a very precise and practical problem that hasn’t been addressed: the refusal of the CIA to disclose the details of its involvement with Islamist groups. In recent weeks, the agency has tried to block sections of a new book that deals with its handling of al-Qaeda before and after September 11. But this is only one part of a large-scale cover-up that Western governments have been perpetrating about decades of ties to Islamist organizations. Until we clarify our murky history with radical Islam, we won’t be able to understand the background of the September 11 attacks and whether our strategies today to engage the Muslim world are likely to succeed.

Of course some of this history is well known. The blowback story—how the US armed the mujahedeen, some of whom morphed into al-Qaeda—has been told in book and film. We are also getting a sense now of how parts of the US-backed Pakistani military-intelligence complex have actively supported radical Islamists. Collusion between Britain and Islamist movements over the past century has also been explored. And of course, Israel’s support for Hamas as a counterweight to the Palestinian Liberation Organization has gone down as one of the great diplomatic miscalculations of recent history.

But compared to the full scope of the issue, these insights are meager. To date, the Central Intelligence Agency continues to block access to its archives relating to radical Islam or cooperation with Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood. In the course of researching my book on the Brotherhood’s expansion into the West, I applied numerous times under the Freedom of Information Act to see documents concerning events in the 1950s, some of which had been confirmed by already declassified State Department cables. Inevitably the CIA responded with the blanket exception of “national security” to justify denying access to any files.

Said Ramadan

Despite the CIA’s information blockade, it is clear from interviews with CIA operatives and other countries’ intelligence archives that the CIA was courting groups like the Brotherhood as allies in the US’s global battle against communism. In Egypt, the charge was often made by the government of Gamel Abdel Nasser that the Muslim Brotherhood was in the CIA’s pay. This was also a view of some Western intelligence agencies, which flatly declared that Said Ramadan, the Swiss-based son-in-law of the group’s founder, was a US agent. The agency may have—but for this we need access to its archives—colluded with Ramadan in attempting a coup against Nasser.

The CIA certainly did help the Brotherhood establish itself in Europe, helping to create the milieu that led to the September 11 attacks. The mosque in Munich that Ramadan helped found, for example, became a hotbed of anti-US activity. The man convicted as a key perpetrator of the 1993 attack against the World Trade Center had sought spiritual counseling at the mosque before leaving to carry out his attacks. And in 1998, the man believed to be al-Qaeda’s chief financial officer was arrested near the mosque and also sought spiritual counseling from the mosque’s imam. An investigation based on this arrest traced radical Islamists right to a second mosque—the al-Quds mosque in Hamburg—where three of the four 9/11 pilots worshipped, it but failed to make the final link. This isn’t to say that the CIA was behind the September 11 attacks but that US collusion with Islamists in the Cold War bore bitter fruit in later years—making it imperative that we understand exactly what happened in those seemingly distant years of the 50s, 60s and 70s of the last century.

More recently, despite Washington’s sometimes hostile public rhetoric toward to the Brotherhood, it is clear that the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama have tried to court the movement. Internal CIA analyses from 2006 and 2008, which I obtained, show that the Brotherhood was viewed as a positive force and potential ally—this time not against communism but Islamist terrorism: the Brotherhood was considered a moderate Islamist group and thus able to channel grievances away from violence toward the United States (even if Brotherhood theoreticians did not renounce violence against Israel or US soldiers). The State Department also used US Muslims close to the Brotherhood to reach out to Islamists in Europe. Such support has given these groups legitimacy in the United States and Europe.

The CIA is blocking the release of information because the subject remains sensitive—both for the West and the Muslim world. In Washington, the CIA could come under fire if its own archives would confirm and fill out the current sketch view of history. For the Brotherhood, amid its current re-emergence as a major political force in Egypt and other countries, it would be extremely damaging to know that illustrious figures in its history were working for the country that most exemplifies the decadent, imperialist forces it has struggled against for decades.

Revealing this history could be painful but necessary to strip away the doublespeak that both sides have used to describe their dealings with each other. This isn’t to say that releasing information should be used to bash cooperation with Islamists. Clearly the United States and other Western countries need to deal with groups like the Brotherhood, and perhaps in some situations even to support them: for example if the Brotherhood really were to come to power democratically in Egypt, the United States would be obliged to deal with such a government. For the Brotherhood a case could be made that in past decades, when its members were so badly repressed by authorities in the Middle East, that some sort of help from the West was necessary to avoid destruction by the authoritarian governments that persecute it.

These are legitimate arguments. But they can only be made if the full history of these relationships is made known rather than kept hidden. To do this will require action from Congress. The CIA did not release documents concerning US intelligence dealings with Nazi officials, for example, until it was forced to by the passage of the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act of 1998. This piece of legislation compelled US government agencies to release all files on their dealings with the Nazis during and after the war. It lead to an incredible flood of information on the topic, helping us understand, for example, US collaboration with ex-Nazis after the war.

We need a similar law today. This is not to draw a parallel between Islamism and Nazism—an argument that is tendentious and counter-productive. The only parallel is that the US government has dealt with these questionable organizations and is so unwilling to admit this that it will take specific instructions from Congress to make these dealings public. Whatever the merits of these policies they are based on a long-standing, but still mostly secret, strategy. As Western governments seek to distinguish between “good” and “bad” Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or between the Muslim Brotherhood and more radical groups in the Middle East, understanding this strategy—and its efficacy—has never been more urgent.","Tue, 30 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Muslim-Brotherhood.jpg,"['muslim', 'islamist', 'cias', 'history', 'information', 'radical', 'attacks', 'cia', 'cover', 'groups', 'brotherhood', 'islamists']", 
72,72,FL-2011-000139-CHN,Preparing clergy for war: army chaplains train by the hundred for the combat zone - CNN,https://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/30/preparing-clergy-for-war-army-chaplains-train-by-the-hundred-for-the-combat-zone/,"By Eric Marrapodi and Chris Lawrence, CNN

Fort Jackson, South Carolina (CNN) – The summer sun beats down on camouflaged Kevlar helmets. Weighed down by heavy body armor, men and women of the cloth are crawling through sand, under barbed wire and learning how to run with soldiers.

Explosions in woods simulate the battlefield as an instructor barks commands.

""You are not following simple instructions! Cover me while I move! Got you covered! Let's go!""

This is the U.S. Army Chaplain Center and School at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, where the Army trains clergy of all faiths how to survive in combat.

Once many of these chaplains complete this modified basic training they will head to war in Afghanistan and Iraq, where the explosions and gunfire are not simulated.

Here at Fort Jackson, on a range in the woods, there is a bevy of broken down cars and trucks to simulate an urban battlefield.

The army says being a chaplain in combat is among the most dangerous jobs because the chaplains move from base to base ministering to soldiers.

""Once you move behind the vehicle, the chaplain, who has no weapon, will stay behind the engine block or the wheel base. That is the safest place for you to be,” the instructor yells to the long line of chaplains who are readying to run this course.

On the battlefield, chaplains look just like any other soldier.

Decked out in camouflage and body armor, the only addition is a two-inch patch signifying their religious affiliation. Christian clergy wear a cross, Jewish clergy tablets showing the Ten Commandments, and Muslim clergy wear a crescent.

What they do not have is a weapon.

Chaplains are unarmed at all times.

They travel in combat with a chaplain assistant who carries a weapon and protects the clergy member.

For this drill the chaplains are learning to hold onto the back of their assistant as they run from obstacle to obstacle.

The pairs have to stay low and move through the course two pairs at a time. The chaplain assistants have to cover the others as they move.

“Cover me while I move!”

“Got you covered!”

Then they run and dive for cover.

""Hold onto him like this and you will not get separated or you will be taken out. You are the target of opportunity. You stay on him!"" The instructor yells when a chaplain is separated from his assistant.

This is about as far away from a suburban pulpit or seminary these clergy can get.

“In school I'm used to sitting at a desk and reading and writing, so it's definitely a little more physical,” 2nd Lt. Adri Bullard said. She is a Methodist seminarian, pursuing a Master’s in Divinity at the divinity school at Vanderbilt University.

“Being in grad school and trying to get your (degree) takes discipline and the discipline is pretty steady throughout my life right now. Getting up early, staying up late. These big booms, that's the main difference. You really don't have those going off at seminary or divinity school, hopefully,” she smiles and pauses as explosions punctuate her points.

She is the smallest person on the range and sports the biggest smile. What she lacks in physical stature, she makes up two-fold in effort and energy.

Bullard is among 200 chaplains and chaplain hopefuls going through various stages of chaplain school at any given time. In Bullard’s class of chaplain candidates, the group covers a wide range. “We’ve got two of our students who are actually in their 50s and we have two that are 22,” said Chaplain Maj. Harold Cline, who is an instructor.

Regardless of age, the candidates are put through their paces.

“When you’re working with soldiers, they’re in good shape. That’s part of their business. If you’re going to minister to them and work with them, rub elbows with them, you’ve got to be in good shape as well.”

The U.S. Army employs around 2,900 chaplains. About half are active duty and the other serve in the reserves. Eight-hundred chaplains and chaplain assistants are deployed in the war on terror and 300 of them serve in the Middle East and Afghanistan, according to a spokesman.

In order to join the ranks, a member of the clergy also has to meet the ordination requirements of their own faith and be endorsed by them to join the military.

Bullard has at least a year of schooling to go before she can be ordained in her church to serve as a full-time minister and an active duty chaplain.

She said she felt the call to ministry in college, “(I) did some of that in a congregational setting, yet felt like there was something else I needed to be doing, maybe taking it to another level in another setting. Military chaplaincy seemed to fit that.”

Even in training she sees a parallel between her spiritual calling and the military.

“You're helping to meet the most basic needs a person has to live and thrive and flourish. I'm going to look for everyone around me and make sure they're drinking water. I'll go get them water if they need it. And that's scriptural,” she said, referring to a passage in the gospels where Jesus talks about giving water to the thirsty.

“So I think it's pretty easy to do ministry out here in the beating South Carolina sun.”

The task at hand

In the Army, each combat unit is able to have a chaplain with them if the commanding officer wants one. They report to that commanding officer and are paid by the military for their services.

The chaplaincy corps had to grow in a hurry as combat operations increased in Iraq and Afghanistan over the last decade, said Chaplain Carlton Birch, the spokesman for the chaplain corps.

“Our country is becoming more pluralist,” Birch said. “We’ve had our first Buddhist chaplain, now we have our first Hindu chaplain. Our chaplain corps has had to adapt.”

It’s a long way from the start of the chaplaincy corps on July 29, 1775, under George Washington.

Today army chaplains minister to soldiers of all faiths regardless of their own. They hold services in remote areas, connect a soldier of another faith with a chaplain of their own, and conduct ceremonies to send a fallen soldier home.

“They are the listening ear, they are there in times of crisis and turmoil for the soldiers,” Birch said. “The value we hold dear is to meet a person at their time of need.”

The danger of their job was brought home for many here last summer when Chaplain Dale Goetz was killed when an improvised explosive device struck the vehicle he was riding in Afghanistan.

He was the first chaplain killed in action since the Vietnam War.

“The danger is sometimes what gives us the credibility to minister to our soldiers. They know we've been there. We've been there with them. We've faced the fear,” Chaplain Capt. Karlyn Maschhoff said.

Maschhoff is a seasoned chaplain with multiple tours to the Middle East under her belt.

She came to Fort Jackson for another component of training – moving from rookie status like Bullard to being a more senior chaplain and helping those new to this unique ministry position.

Before September 11, 2001, she was writing Sunday school material and doing mission work. “I came into the chaplaincy after the events of 9/11. That made a profound impact on me when I saw the need for chaplains,” Maschhoff said.

“It was a combination of patriotism and recognizing the needs of soldiers as they climbed on those planes to go to a place where they would be in harm’s way and I just felt the need to be with them, to go with them. That is what led to me accepting the call.”

During her prior tours in Iraq she has seen the worst of war on the battlefield and on the home front.

“My first deployment was in 2005-2006 and that was a tough period. There was a lot of loss of life, a lot of bloodshed and a lot of uncertainty. But then I also went back later in 2008 for a 15-month deployment and at that time you got to see things improving. Incidents were happening, but you got to see progress.”

“Losing soldiers is always tough,” she said. “Watching families struggle through a deployment, yet you come on, you struggle on together. You get through the tough days together. You continue on. As a chaplain you bring hope for the future and that is our message to our soldiers, that it's a dark day but it's going to get better.”

Heading home the hard way

""In country if you're doing one of these it could be 100, 130 degrees, maybe even hotter,"" Cline barks as rookie chaplains learn how to send a soldier home the hard way, with a dignified transfer ceremony.

They practice with a flag-draped metal transfer case, identical to the thousands of cases used to send slain soldiers home from war.

Before the transfer case boards the plane for the long flight home, the chaplains say a prayer or hold a brief service.

“She may have moved on from this Earth, but she's still in my heart,"" a chaplain in training says as he looks over the transfer case.

Six soldiers pick up the case. They snap their heels together and begin to move.

""You do not want to be the chaplain who is walking too slow in front of an honors team,” Cline said. “Why? They're carrying the body, they're carrying the transfer case, and even though the case is relatively light, it's got a body in it and it’s full of ice, so they're carrying a lot of weight. Don't slow them down and don't make them hold that transfer case up while you're doing something ceremonial.""

The chaplain candidate puts his hand on the flag, bows his head, and sends the solider off with a prayer.

Today is a drill, but the Army says in as little as two weeks, these trainees could be doing the real ceremony on an airstrip in Iraq or Afghanistan.

Days after our interview, Maschhoff was on a plane back to the Middle East to begin her third tour, fully confident of her mission from her commanders and from on high, “It's challenging and you know there are tough times ahead, but you're there to do what you've been trained to do. You're there taking care of soldiers and it doesn't get better than that.”

The delightful season of guavas is here. The tropical fruit, a powerhouse of nutrition within the reach of the common man, is available at every street side here now. You can have it raw, ripe, plain or with a dash of chilli powder and salt. The more industrious can cook it and can it into jams and jellies.

Though available throughout the year, guavas usually flood the market between July and October. In Karnataka, the most widely cultivated varieties are the Allahabad Safeda and Lucknow 49, also known as Sardar.

The varieties

The Horticulture Department said the Allahabad variety of the fruit is large and round, with skin smooth and yellowish white. Sardar is primrose yellow and is sweet and tasty. Local varieties such as pink-pulped Navalur are, unfortunately, almost extinct.

Bangalore gets the fruit from Hoskote, Yelahanka, Doddaballapur, Devanahalli, Magadi, Nelamangala, and surroundings of Bangalore Rural and Kolar districts.

The fruit is at present seen as commercially unviable as, unlike, say coconut or mango, there is no organised market. So farmers grow it in small land holdings of less than an acre.

The price depends on the size of the fruit, and, yes, location. While right now it sells for Rs. 60 to 70 a kg in K.R. Market, it comes at a steep Rs. 100 a kg in tony neighbourhoods and prime shopping areas such as M.G. Road and Commercial Street.

“I sort the foods according to their size and sell them at Rs. 10, Rs. 5 and Rs 3 each,” says Hanumanthappa, who has positioned himself with a bicycle in front of the Vidhana Soudha. On an average, he takes home Rs. 300 a day.

According to the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, guava is grown in almost all the districts of the State in an estimated 4,240 hectares, though Kolar district alone produces over 30 per cent of the annual 23,000-tonne harvest.

The plant starts bearing within three or four years. On an average, a 10-year-old plant may yield about 1,000 to 1,500 fruits a year.

Being very hardy, the guava can withstand drought conditions, and gives an assured crop even with very little care. Its cost of production is low as it needs very little fertiliser, irrigation and plant protection. It is also grown as a backyard fruit.

Nutritional security

It is an ideal fruit for the nutritional security. A storehouse of vitamin C, the entire fruit, including rind, flesh and seeds, should be eaten for maximum health benefits.

Rafeeq Ahmed of Vijayanagar says he sources the fruit directly from farmers who come to the Housing Board in the wee hours to sell their harvest. “I buy three bags for Rs. 450 and earn a net profit of Rs. 250 a day. There is a lot of demand for it as other fruits like apple, pomegranate and orange are very expensive.”","Tue, 30 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article13635613.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGP2GUAVA,"['guava', 'market', 'need', 'fruit', 'sell', 'salt', 'powerhouse', 'rs', 'plant', 'chilli', 'varieties', 'size', 'powder', 'little']", 
75,75,FL-2011-000139-CHN,Migrants suffer in Tripoli camps - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2011/9/1/migrants-suffer-in-tripoli-camps,"Three years ago, Anthony Ogiexeri came to Libya from Nigeria in search of a better life. He moved into Tripoli’s rough Abu Salim neighbourhood where he met his wife, had a child, and found work as a bricklayer.

In Libya, he earned several times the roughly $190-a-month salary he would find in Nigeria. The country’s relative stability and oil-backed economy meant Ogiexeri could take care of himself, his new family and save for the future.

All that is gone now, swept away by revolution. Ogiexeri is trapped, along with hundreds of other sub-Saharan Africans, in a squatter camp at an abandoned port facility on Tripoli’s western fringes, afraid to venture out for fear of reprisals and suffering in squalor as they wait for help.

Elsewhere in the capital, black Libyans and other migrants are being arrested on sight and imprisoned by armed residents, rebel fighters and untrained officials who have assumed localised control of security in the wake of Muammar Gaddafi’s defeat and disappearance.

The campaign of arrests has alarmed human rights groups and illustrates the persistent racial tensions and absence of a central, accountable authority in Libya as the National Transitional Council begins to assert control over a country that had been ruled through one family for more than 41 years.

Men and women like Ogiexeri are stuck. Going home means a return to poverty, staying in Libya means violence, possibly death.

“If there is any place in the world where we can just work, even if it means us digging in the ground, wherever, we would be very much happy to leave this place,” Ogiexeri said.

Shattered Lives

The harbor squatter’s camp is set back from a main thoroughfare of shops and houses in Tripoli’s sprawling Janzour district, invisible down a tree-lined dirt track that leads to a scrub-covered bluff, below which sits the camp.

Next to the camp is an unfinished concrete marine facility with an enormous, empty, trash-filled pool, possibly a former military training base, where a few of the camp residents sleep and shield themselves from the 38-degree cloudless heat.

But most have made homes on the flat, sandy expanse of the port, by the sides of broken-down, dry-docked fishing boats, where they have tied blankets and arranged chairs and makeshift tables. They cook pots of stew for most of their meals and pass the time with a variation on checkers they call “draift”.

Most of the camp residents who spoke with Al Jazeera during two recent visits described tolerable lives that had been shattered by the popular uprising. Others simply went from bad to worse. One man, 47-year-old Muhammed Hamid, had been resettled in Tripoli after fleeing the conflict in Sudan’s Darfur region three years ago. Now he was a refugee again.

Many described how race-based discrimination and violence, long an issue in Libya, had been inflamed by the war.

Justice Ansan, a stringy 45-year-old Ghanaian with a salt-and-pepper goatee, was living with other migrants in a house in Tripoli when, around two weeks ago, six men broke inside, demanding money. Ansan struggled with one of the men, who pulled a knife and stabbed him low in the pelvis, leaving a five-inch cut up through his belly. They stole Ansan’s passport and $4,000 – his life savings. He spent three days in hospital, having avoided any serious internal injury, and then came to the camp.

“Once you’re a black man, even the small boys oppress you,” Ogiexeri said.

‘Lost everything’

Camp residents have alleged that when rebels advanced through the area on their way to the capital around two weeks ago, opposition fighters came into the camp, assembled everyone there, then stole some of their possessions and raped some of the women. Aid workers who have taken down accounts of rape say there is no way to know for certain who committed the acts, especially since the territory was contested at the time.

But the abuse, residents say, occurred before and after the rebels’ arrival.

Local men have repeatedly raided the camp, stealing phones, money and provisions. According to numerous residents, they have also raped women. Tina Udi, a 29-year-old Nigerian who is five months pregnant, said she had to flee into the surrounding bushes for three hours one recent night when the men made one of their visits, firing weapons into the air.

During Al Jazeera’s first visit to the camp, a Libyan man walking among the boats asked if journalists had a permit to be there and walked away when told they did. During the second visit, a member of the Al Jazeera staff responded to gunshots being fired in the air near a journalist’s car and found two local men who asked how long the visitors would stay.

Udi, who lives in the camp with her husband, previously worked in deep southern Libya, near Chad and Niger, selling food across the borders. She decided to head to Tripoli in March after the fighting began, in order to find a flight home. It took three days to reach the outskirts of the capital, where Udi’s bus ran into a checkpoint guarded by armed men without uniforms. They wanted money and knew all the hiding places, quickly finding the cash she had hidden in her hair.

Udi said she could not find flights to Nigeria. She decided to stay briefly in the Abu Salim neighbourhood, but nighttime gunfire and explosions scared her way. In June, she moved to join other migrants at the harbor.

The camp proved no better. The food is poor, she said; there is no meat or fish and the water they retrieve from streams and nearby wells tastes salty. She estimates that she is among 10 to 15 pregnant women there.

“I worked very hard so I could earn a good living,” she said. “We lost everything during the war. We need help from the UN.”

Dangerous racism

Libya’s revolution, according to its political leaders, aims to supplant the eccentric authoritarianism of Gaddafi with freedom, democracy and equality. But the opposition now coming into government will have to confront a legacy of discrimination against minorities that has recently found new life.

In the past, Gaddafi has oppressed both black Libyans and ethnic Arab Berbers in the western Nafusa Mountains. Last year, the regime lashed out against the Tabu tribe, darker-skinned Libyans who live in and around the towns of Sabha and Kufra near the Chad border. Tabu homes were demolished and the people stripped of their nationality during a small armed conflict.

More recently, Gaddafi reportedly offered nationality to Tuareg fighters from Niger, Mali and elsewhere if they would fight on his side against the rebels. While discrimination against black Libyans is not new, it was this strategy and other efforts by Gaddafi to enlist poor, dark-skinned migrants that have inspired a backlash among the mostly Arab Libyan rebels.

Promise Ebroriku speaks about rebels who tried to recruit him to fight



Black men in Libya are now targets. Though many can be seen walking the streets and working freely – a van even came to pick up selected residents at the squatters camp for cleaning work in Tripoli – opposition forces have arrested many for no other reason than their race.

Camp residents say that men sent out of the camp to buy supplies, including five on Sunday, have been arrested. Other migrants living together in homes in the surrounding Janzour district are also afraid to venture too far.

Promise Ebroriku, a 30-year-old Nigerian in the camp, worked in the Kashmir restaurant in Benghazi, the eastern hot bed of the revolution, until he decided to abandon the battered city in April and head to Sudan. On the road south, his car was stopped at a rebel checkpoint. The fighters pulled him and his companions aside and offered them weapons to join the fight against Gaddafi. Some men agreed, but Ebroriku refused. He was beaten with rifle butts for his decision, he said, and still feels pain in his chest when he breaths.

The International Organisation for Migration, which specialises in evacuating foreign nationals from war zones, has said it is aware of the situation in the camp but still has not negotiated safe access with Tripoli’s political or military leaders.

Robin Waudo, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Tripoli, said ICRC workers had visited the camp and confirmed they had received accounts of mistreatment and rape similar to those heard by Al Jazeera.

Few camp residents want to return to their home countries, he said. Yet the security situation is untenable, and the ICRC has been talking to the local Janzour council to try to ensure the residents are not exposed to any further abuse, Waudo said.

But the ICRC and the IOM have still been unable to remove anyone from the squalid conditions, nor even begin the process of reconnecting the refugees with their families back home, many of whom haven’t heard from them in weeks.

Waiting for help

Ebroriku was released, but many other dark-skinned men in Libya have not been as lucky.

Inside Ain Zara police station in the southeastern district of Fernaj on Monday, Al Jazeera found a group of sub-Sarahan Africans being held inside a multi-room cell on suspicion of having fought or worked for the regime during the uprising. The group included Gambians, Guineans, Chadians, Malians and Senegalese. They said there were 31 inside but produced a list of 18 names when asked.

At first, the opposition men working at the station said they were holding only common criminals, those found drunk or looting. After Al Jazeera spoke with the prisoners, however, the guards said the black men needed to be interrogated and their cases investigated for possible regime ties before being released.

While Al Jazeera journalists were present, the guards released 10 lighter-skinned Libyan men in the cell. They had been found living together in an apartment, interrogated, and held in custody for one night.

Mamadou Saidou Jaliow, a 25-year-old Gambian, explained through the cell door’s bars that he had come to Libya to find a boat to take him illegally to the Italian island of Lampedusa – the trafficking route Gaddafi had suddenly opened in order to punish NATO countries with a flood of humanity.

On the road from Sabha to Tripoli, Gaddafi loyalist troops stole the $700 Jaliow planned to use to pay his smuggler’s fare. When he arrived in the capital on August 15, he found a Senegalese man in the Old City who helped him find an apartment with other Gambians. The men stayed informed about the rebels’ military progress by watching Al Jazeera, CNN and BBC.

One night, after rebels took the capital, armed men came to check the apartment. They were respectful, looked for weapons, and left, Jaliow said. The following night, at 3am, eight men returned with the landlord, demanding the migrants’ passports and tying their hands. They said they wanted the migrants to speak with their elders. After an hour of interrogation in the police station, they were put in the cell. On Monday, Jaliow had spent three days inside.

“They say it’s a new democracy, they are going to help us,” Jaliow said. “They took our money, our passports … we have not been able to contact our families.

“They told us that they were going to release us, [that] they are just going to hold us for a while because the city is not safe.”

For three days, the men’s diet was water, milk, and cake, he said. On Sunday, the guards brought rice.

Saleh Suleiman al-Ghradi, the new “coordinator” for the station, said the prisoners had received fruit and meat and were eating better than they would normally.

Some of the men inside the cell had served among Gaddafi’s troops, Ghradi said, but the police station leaders had agreed that the men would be released if there wasn’t any proof to tie them to the regime.

None of the jailers were trained for their job, Ghradi admitted. They were electronics engineers, taxi drivers and mechanics. But all had been selected by merit, he said.

No justice

The ability of ad-hoc local citizens’ committees to arrest and detain anyone, especially vulnerable migrants, has troubled human rights workers, who are concerned that there is no accountable justice system, even a temporary one, yet in place.

Edmond Okoror, a 25-year-old Nigerian, explains refugees’ dilemma of returning home or staying in Libya

On Monday, workers with Amnesty International witnessed rebels forcibly remove a black man being treated in Tripoli Medical Center. An attending physician “authorised” the man’s arrest.

The fighters said he would be taken to Misrata for questioning and argued that interrogators in Tripoli “let killers free”. The man was from the town of Tawargha, east of Tripoli, which is known for being sympathetic to Gaddafi and where loyalist brigades had marshaled and fired rockets on Misrata.

The fighters told two other black men in the hospital that “their turn was coming”.

Samira Bouslama, an Amnesty worker in Tripoli, said that during a visit to Ain Zara prison, warden Lotfi Mesalati told investigators that of 304 detainees, more than half were “black Africans”. Among them were 11 Nigerian women being held in cramped, unsanitary conditions, Bouslama told Al Jazeera.

The women said that rebels had raided their house on August 22, arrested the men living there and took money and valuables. The next day, the women were arrested on their way to shop. They were kept overnight in a mosque with around 30 men, then transferred to Ain Zara, which rebels emptied on August 23 and have since converted into the city’s first semi-official prison, with the approval of the local military council.

The women complained to Bouslama about the quality of their food and the lack of running water to use for showers. They have no access to feminine products and have torn off pieces of their own clothes to use as tampons, Bouslama said.

“Our concern is: Who has the power,” Bouslama said, and what happens when young men with guns and grudges “go looking for revenge”.

“What is the hierarchy? Who has the power of arrest?” she asked.

Mesalati told Amnesty investigators that inmates’ charges would be checked and the cases assigned to judges and prosecutors. If men were found not guilty, they would be released, he said. But Mesalati was removed from his post this week, Bouslama said, and evidence of the judicial effort has yet to be seen.","Thu, 01 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/20119110324839734_20.jpeg?fit=680%2C450,"['libya', 'migrants', 'women', 'rebels', 'suffer', 'camps', 'tripoli', 'al', 'gaddafi', 'camp', 'men', 'residents']",

Yesterday, we posted the first part of Andrea Pike's birth story. She gave birth to her first twin, but the second was transverse, so she had to have a C-section. That's when things got scary. Andrea blacked out. Her husband, Jeff, wrote the second part, about how he witnessed the birth of his second daughter. Then, he wrote, there was a flurry in the operating room — surgeons came in and he was pushed out. As he waited, a nurse said to him, ""I'm so sorry. They're doing everything they can."" Here, Andrea writes part three, which begins when she wakes up.

I'm cold. No, I'm freezing. I'm shaking so hard, and I'm afraid my teeth are going to chip from rattling together as hard as they are.

I'm not sure where I am. Wait, no ... I'm in a hospital. Right? There's a person sitting next to me, and she smiles at me when I look at her. She says something to someone outside of the small, curtained-off corner we're in. I'm still freezing, and now I'm starting to panic. I don't see the one person I need. The one person who can comfort me and tell me what is going on.

""Where is my Jeffrey?"" I whisper through chattering teeth.

""We're getting him, sweetie,"" says the lady sitting next to me.

I close my eyes, and I fall back to sleep for what feels like hours. When I open my eyes, I see him. I want to cry, but for some reason, I don't.

""Jeffrey, I love you so much,"" I tell him. He comes closer to me and nuzzles his face to mine. His hands and cheeks and lips are so warm. Then, like a flash flood, it all comes back to me. I had a baby. I had two babies. I got to push one out. The other one had to be cut out of me. Where are they? Are they OK? Are they healthy?

About Andrea Andrea Pike, 31, from Union, Ky., gave birth to twin girls Natalie and Elizabeth on Aug. 3. She and her husband, Jeff, also have two young sons who were adopted. Andrea's Full Bio

More From Andrea

Jeff says something to me, but I don't hear him. Maybe I hear him, but I don't understand him. He steps back a little and motions to the clear, plastic tub beside my bed. And there they are. My babies. I know them both, but the one on the left looks more familiar to me. Jeff picks up the one on the right and brings her face to mine. She's beautiful. I'm already so very in love.

I think he's telling me that our family is here and that they want to see me. I see my mother-in-law appear from behind the curtain. Her hair color is different from the last time I saw her. She's saying something to me, and it looks like she's been crying, but I don't know what she's saying and I have no idea why she would be crying. She disappears, and then my sister-in-law appears. She's wearing a ball cap, and her curly hair looks cute in a ponytail. She says something too, but I'm not sure what.

Then she leaves and Barb, my best friend, shows up. It's starting to feel a bit like a magic show; people appearing and then disappearing into thin air. She says that my hands look really swollen and asks if my wedding band is hurting my finger. I don't remember answering her, but she says that it looks like it hurts. And just like that, she's gone and is replaced by my father-in-law. He's smiling and looks really, really happy. At one point, I'm on a cell phone, talking to my dad. He sounds shaken, but happy to be talking to me.

I still want to know what happened to me. I can see the clock from where I'm laying, and it's almost six hours from the time I remember going into the operating room. That doesn't seem right. Jeff tells me that they're going to start bringing us back to our room and that they're going to take Natalie first, so they can give her a bath. He kisses me and leaves.

The lady who has been sitting next to me this whole time turns out to be a nurse. She looks at me and says, ""You know, that man loves you so much. Even though he wasn't in the room physically, he never left your side."" I nod and begin to cry. I ask her if I can hold Elizabeth until we go back to our room. I want to hold her because I know she was born early, and I remember hearing about skin-to-skin being rather healing for preemies. I want to try to heal her prematurity. I lower my gown and she is placed, wearing nothing but a diaper, on my chest.

The instant her skin touches mine, however, I feel that she is healing me. As we lie there, meeting face-to-face for the first time (skin-to-skin, rather), my body begins to warm, my jaw stops vibrating, and I let myself melt into my precious daughter, and I weep.

The next morning, when I'm finally conscious enough to hold a conversation, I ask my nurse to tell me exactly what had happened. She sits down, and as my daughters sleep in their tubs and my husband sleeps on the fold-out bed in the corner, she tells me the story from the night before. I hear everything she says and understand what it all means, but it all sounds made-up and over-the-top.

It wouldn't be until weeks later, as I sat home alone with my girls while my guys went to the county fair, that I would really grasp what had happened. I was getting ready to take a shower, and I happened to catch a glimpse of the stapled incision across my lower midsection. I touched it and said out loud, ""I don't have a uterus anymore."" As soon as those words left my lips, I sobbed. Later that night, Jeff and I talked about the girls' delivery and subsequent surgery.

""The way I see it is this: Your uterus was sick to begin with, but it managed to give us everything it had,"" he said.

""You're right,"" I said. ""She gave us our daughters as a swan song, and then she died. Sort of poetic, if you think about it like that.""

As I drifted off to sleep that night, being held tight by my Jeffrey, I realized that I was one of the lucky ones who not only had everything she wanted in life, but was fully aware of it.","Tue, 30 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2011/08/30/ellieandnatalie_wide-8add3bde9dbeac36ce41fb38b7202bde1893e6ca.jpg?s=1400,"['ones', 'im', 'andrea', 'looks', 'dont', 'know', 'jeff', 'aching', 'going', 'right', 'surgery', 'room', 'waking', 'shes', 'confused', 'cold', 'loved']", 
79,79,FL-2011-000139-CHN,"Eclectic guest list for Lauren Bush wedding: Ivanka Trump, Elizabeth Berkley, George W — and Oprah? - CultureMap Houston",https://houston.culturemap.com/news/fashion/09-03-11-06-27-eclectic-guest-list-for-lauren-bush-weddingivanka-trump-elizabeth-berkeley-and-w-1,"Fashion and political royalty, along with an eclectic mix of celebrity friends of Lauren Bush and David Lauren, have gathered in Colorado for the couple's wedding this weekend. Among the activities in Telluride: A softball game today, rehearsal dinner tonight, the wedding at Ralph Lauren's Double L ranch on Sunday and a rodeo on Monday.

Ivanka Trump, with new baby in tow, is part of the festivities. On Friday she tweeted: ‘Just boarded a plane headed to @LaurenBushTweet's wedding in Colorado. Whoo hoo!’

She added that it was her infant daughter's first plane ride — but surely not her last. ""Baby's first flight! So far so good. She's fed and sleeping but... apologies in advance to all other passengers!"" she wrote.

""George and Laura are definitely going and they’re looking forward to it,"" a source told the Daily Mail. ""The idea that bad blood in the past would keep them away is just wrong. It is going to be a happy day and they want to be there to see it.’

Actress Elizabeth Berkley, best known for her role in the TV series Saved by the Bell and the camp classic, Showgirls, is also in Colorado for the wedding. She tweeted: ""u r going to b a stunning bride. Excited to share this blessed moment! Xo:"".

Berkley is married to Greg Lauren, the groom's cousin.

A spokesperson for George W. Bush declined to confirm whether the former president, who is Lauren Bush's uncle, would attend the wedding. But the Daily Mail reported that Bush and former first lady Laura Bush will be in Colorado for the festitivites.

""George and Laura are definitely going and they’re looking forward to it,"" a source close to the couple told the British newspaper. ""The idea that bad blood in the past would keep them away is just wrong. It is going to be a happy day and they want to be there to see it.’

The source was referring to reports that the acrimonious divorce of Lauren Bush's parents, Neil and Sharon Bush, in 2003 had caused a rift in the family. However, Neil will attend with wife Maria and Sharon will attend with her Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia. (Sounds a bit like Dynasty, doesn't it?)

Neil, who is doing business in China and has an account on Weibo with 45,000 followers, wrote on the Chinese microblogging service Friday:

‘My daughter Lauren will be married this Sunday. She is 27 years old, a former model, now is a very successful entrepreneur.

‘She will marry married David Lauren, a very good man, he has loved and supported my daughter.

‘After the wedding, Lauren will become Lauren Bush-Lauren.’

Making matters more intriguing, the wedding is taking place the same weekend as the Telluride Film Festival, where such celebrities as George Clooney and Johnny Depp are rumored to be in town, according to the Telluride Daily Planet.

The newspaper cited Facebook sitings of Oprah Winfrey, although rumors that the former talk show queen was in Telluride could not be confirmed. Winfrey scored a rare interview with Ralph Lauren (David's father) at his Telluride ranch, where the wedding will take place, during her final season. It was his first televised interview in 20 years. And Winfrey was unusually chummy with George W. Bush, when he appeared on her show earlier this year to tout his new book, Decision Points.

About the only notables from the Bush clan who won't be in attendance are Lauren Bush's grandparents, former president George H.W. Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush. A Bush spokesman told ABCNews.com the couple will be unable to go because the ranch's high altitude could pose a threat to their health.","Sat, 03 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://houston.culturemap.com/favicon.ico,"['list', 'oprah', 'elizabeth', 'winfrey', 'told', 'wedding', 'going', 'source', 'w', 'telluride', 'trump', 'ivanka', 'george', 'colorado', 'guest', 'lauren', 'bush']",

81,81,FL-2011-000139-CHN,"Out of a job, Gadhafi's Tuareg fighters may create new troubles - CNN International",https://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/09/08/libya.tuareg/,"(CNN) -- They are the Kurds of Africa, an ancient stateless people with their own language, a minority spread across several countries, weathered by their harsh surroundings.

And like the Kurds, the Tuareg are now at the center of international attention. Some are helping Moammar Gadhafi loyalists escape Libya across the endless expanses of the Sahel. Many more are trapped in Libya, trying to escape its post-revolutionary chaos.

Gadhafi often turned to the nomadic Tuareg to bolster his forces and his attempts to manipulate and destabilize the poor countries to the south of Libya: Niger, Chad and Mali. The Tuareg were capable mercenaries. And there was a hint of romance in the arrangement -- Gadhafi has always painted himself as a desert Bedouin.

Peter Gwin, a journalist with National Geographic, has visited Tuareg areas of Mali and Niger frequently. He says one Tuareg who had visited many Libyan army bases told him that even before the uprising against Gadhafi began there were some 10,000 Tuareg fighters in the Libyan military.

For the Tuareg it was a marriage of convenience; they could send money home and received arms and money for their rebellions. Gadhafi long supported the Niger Movement for Justice, a Tuareg rebel group, and gave its leaders villas in Tripoli.

As the revolt against his rule began, Gadhafi sent recruiters to Mali and Niger. Gwin says they were reportedly offering $1,000 a month to Tuareg recruits, an incredible sum in an area where the average income is less than $1 a day. Hundreds signed up.

One fighter Gwin met in the Malian city of Timbuktu described being involved in carrying out Gadhafi's order to ""clean"" the city of Misrata, a rebel stronghold.

""I asked him did that actually happen,"" said Gwin, ""and he said half of Misrata was cleaned. ... and I said what about civilians? And he said: 'Everyone.' What about women and children? And he nodded and said: 'Yes.' ""

But Tuareg fighters told Gwin that Gadhafi had failed to deliver on many promises -- of cash, homes and cars. And they were not expecting to be bombed from the air. Many deserted and began the long difficult journey home across the Sahara and arid mountain ranges, avoiding checkpoints as they went.

The danger now is that many of them -- young, jobless men -- will rekindle simmering revolts. In Niger the rebels control swathes of territory.

Gwin describes it in September's edition of National Geographic magazine as ""a vast primordial landscape -- a place defined by salt pans that take the better part of a day to cross, dune fields that rise and fall like violent seas, and mammoth outcroppings of glassy marble and obsidian that breach the sand like extinct sea creatures.""

The Tuareg trust few outsiders. Gwin says it is not only to combat the elements that the men cover their faces with turbans, and they are guided by a proverb: ""Kiss the hand you cannot sever.""

But since Mali and Niger gained independence, the Tuareg have been neglected and marginalized. In Niger, the Tuareg complain that they have no schools or wells -- even as governments have raked in millions from rich seams of uranium.

That was the spark for the most recent revolt. Not all Tuaregs supported it; there are disparate factions and clans. Even so, the governments of the Sahel -- especially Niger -- are shuddering at the prospect of well-armed fighters returning to their unstable countries.

A group of prominent Tuaregs from Niger and Mali has appealed to Libya's National Transitional Council to protect those Tuaregs still in Libya. Mohamed Anacko, head of the Agadez Regional Council in Niger, told CNN that they ""wanted to avoid a crisis like in Libya here at home. So (we wanted) to make a contract between those who fight, who are in the Libyan army and the NTC.""

Niger and Mali are very fragile states, Anacko said by phone from Agadez. ""There really is a risk of famine this year. There are lots of people who are arriving, some are transferring to West Africa but (others) are remaining in Agadez some months. ... so we have lots of worries this year, in the next three to four months.""

Human rights groups have also called on Libya's new rulers not to seek revenge against the Tuareg and other Africans, to prevent a further flood of refugees. Niger -- in the grip of a prolonged drought -- is already struggling to absorb as many as 200,000 of its own citizens who have returned from Libya, according to the European Union's counter-terrorism co-coordinator, Gilles de Kerchove.

There is also the risk that renewed instability in the region will play into the hands of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), one of the group's fastest-growing affiliates, which has made a lot of money from kidnap ransoms.

Terrorism analysts say AQIM may already have obtained weapons looted in Libya's chaos. Nigerien forces were involved in a shoot-out in June against an armed group carrying detonators, explosives and cash. The government said they were destined for AQIM.

Anacko told CNN that his group was trying to help Libyans and others who were trying to escape the fighting, to prevent al Qaeda from taking advantage of the situation. ""If we don't help them, it is certain that al Qaeda will take them,"" he said. ""We open the door, weapons or not, they give away their weapons and they go back.""

The Tuareg are not Arabs and have little sympathy for al Qaeda, but their paths may cross in the flourishing drugs trade in this part of Africa. The Tuareg have a reputation for doing business with anyone.

In his National Geographic piece, Peter Gwin relates a conversation with a Tuareg rebel commander who said the West should help them combat al Qaeda and drug smugglers. ""Given the Tuareg history of betrayal and infighting,"" Gwin asked him, ""could the West trust them?""

""He answered with a click of his tongue. I couldn't gauge his expression because his face was completely obscured by his turban.""","Thu, 08 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/newsscanner/no_image_cnn_90x51.jpg,"['libya', 'qaeda', 'told', 'fighters', 'job', 'mali', 'gwin', 'create', 'troubles', 'al', 'national', 'gadhafi', 'gadhafis', 'niger', 'tuareg']",

(CNN) - The details of the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and the plane crash in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, will be remembered at length this week. What, when, how and who will dominate the headlines. As people across the country head to churches, temples and mosques this weekend, they will once again wonder why. They will look to the pulpit and listen for an answer.

This week, clergy of all faiths are preparing answers as their congregants ask why 9/11 happened, how it should be remembered and what their response should be as they go out from their sacred space and back into the secular.

For some, there will be calls to patriotism among the prayers. Others will shy away from country.

The remembrances cover a wide variety. Some churches will bring care packages to first responders, Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles will be packed for a prayer service Saturday, and there will be hundreds of churches simulcasting services featuring megachurch pastor Rick Warren or other famed clergy.

We spoke with clergy of many different faiths, in many different parts of the country, and asked how they were preparing and what they would tell the faithful as the 10th anniversary of 9/11 falls on a Sunday.

The Rev. Rich Smith had just arrived as the pastor of a church in Bethesda, Maryland, just outside Washington, D.C., in 2001. His first Sunday was September 9, 2001. On the morning of the 11th, they were planning for the next service. ""A lot of that had to go out the window,"" he said.

He was fortunate, he said, because no one from the church died in the attack. A family joined later and the husband, a lieutenant colonel in the Army, was at the Pentagon when the plane struck on 9/11. ""He described running as the floor was collapsing behind him,"" Smith said.

Smith said that 9/11 ""affected the whole nine years I was there.""

Today, Smith pastors the First Congregational Church in Reno, Nevada, part of the United Church of Christ.

""Even though Reno wasn't attacked, I think people feel like we as a nation were attacked. Even when you're out in the hinterlands like we are, you still feel like you're part of something bigger.""

For their 9/11 services, thousands of Catholic and Protestant churches that follow the lectionary, a standardized collection of scripture readings, will be reading from the Gospel of Matthew, where Jesus teaches his disciples how to forgive.

Smith's church will do the same. He said there's some providence to the timing of the passage.

As he preaches about forgiveness, he will remind his congregants of a quote from Nelson Mandela. South Africa, he said, was a, ""marvelous example of how you handle something when you feel like you've been so wronged.""

""I love the phrase Mandela used, 'No future without forgiveness.' ""

In New Orleans, Catholics sitting in the well-worn pews of St. Louis Cathedral in the French Quarter will hear the same passage from Matthew and a similar theme from the Rev. Msgr. Crosby W. Kern when he steps up to the pulpit.

""Forgiveness is probably God’s plan. We don’t forget. We don’t let our guard down. We as a people should be defensive to protect ourselves. But have we got that same sense of mercy and forgiveness we see in God the Father? Whatever our attitude is to our enemies, it’s a good time for us to reflect one that,"" Kern said.

He will preach to a group of congregants who faced different struggles in the past decade. The statue of Jesus in the back of the church is still missing fingers, a scar from Hurricane Katrina; one that Kern hopes to restore this year.

""We don't forget. We learn. But part of the American psyche is, we are big enough to forgive. We are big enough to try and get over the scars and the wounds that we've suffered throughout our history. It might take a long time, but we can't give up,"" he said.

In the passage in Matthew, Jesus tells Peter he should forgive the person who has wronged him seven times seventy. ""In scripture for us, that's eternal. That's the perfect number, without end. So I'm going to take off on the forgiveness part,"" explained Father Adam Lee Ortega y Ortiz, Pastor of Santa Maria de la Paz Catholic Church in Sante Fe, New Mexico.

""I know people are meditating on the evil of the attack and the anger it brought about,"" he said. ""When we can quench the anger in our own hearts first, we can do a lot better in the world.""

Chaplain Capt. Mijikai Mason, a Southern Baptist minister, will be preaching Sunday to a group of high school students at a military academy outside Columbia, South Carolina. As a member of the Army, he has lived the response to 9/11 and the wars that followed. His audience this Sunday were toddlers at the time of the attack.

He will preach on theme of remembrance. ""Now we’re in more of a healing phase. Now it’s more how will we remember and celebrating the lives that were lost,” he said.

Maj. Tommie Pickens, one of Mason's fellow chaplains, is being flown to Chicago to deliver the message Sunday at Addison Community Church on the west side. Pickens said the church is patriotic and loves the U.S. and its military.

He will be preaching from 2 Chronicles 7:14: ""If my people which I call by name, humble themselves and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and heal their land.""

The verse refers specifically to ancient Israelites but has been interpreted throughout the ages to apply to any country at any time and is very popular with American evangelicals.

Pickens will preach about the first responders, the troops and the spirit of unity that swept the country after the attack, ""and lifted the simple prayer, 'God bless America.' ""

""We need to remember the cost of the human lives,"" he said. As congregants go out after the service, he wants them to remember to ""be proud of our great nation. Be proud we live in the land of the free because of the brave. Our nation has always exemplified resolve.""

""We can stand tall even at the end of a horrible day,"" he will emphasize.

Days after the attacks, the Rev Billy Graham stood and delivered a sermon to the nation at Washington National Cathedral. Ten years later, Graham is 93 and does not have the stamina to participate in any services, said his daughter Anne Graham Lotz.

His health is failing, and his daughter will be taking the pulpit this year.

Her message will focus on Isaiah Chapter 6, which pertains to when Israel was in crisis and how the prophet's life was shaken.

""When his life was shaken, he didn't say, 'why me?' and allow his life to be filled with self-pity. He looked up,"" she said.

""I'm going to take that and flesh it out,"" Graham said. ""I think it's very appropriate that in times like this, we look up and ask God to give us a fresh glimpse of himself and a revelation of truth."" Her sermon will be in Raleigh, North Carolina, and simulcast around the world on radio and TV.

Tony Campolo will be guest pastor at Trinity United Methodist Church in Little Rock, Arkansas. Campolo is a professor of sociology at Eastern University, a Baptist school not far from Philadelphia. For years, he has been a popular speaker and author, and he relishes his role as the guy who comes in to speak and gets to leave at the end of the service. It frees him to speak what he feels God is calling him to say.

""If I anger people, I'm gone. It's easier for me to sound the prophetic voice than someone who is there all the time,"" he said.

Campolo will also be preaching on Isaiah Chapter 6 but will take a different approach than Graham.

""The focus of the passage is that there is a sense that in a national crisis, each of us is called upon to stand up and be instruments of God for making things right in the world,"" he said.

He will also warn congregants against the radical elements in their own midst, not just in other faiths. ""All religions have the tendency to create extremism, and in the words of Fredrich Nietzsche, 'Men never do evil with more enthusiasm, than when they do it in the name of God.' And we must recognize that the evil we see in the extremists in the Muslim community that brought about 9/11, is the extremism that we can find in the Jewish community and in the Christian community.""

""Revenge is not the way of God's people,"" he will say, knowing that the memory of 9/11 can stir up old emotions and broad hatred that he says is ""unbefitting of religious people.""

Rabbi Shmuel Herzfeld of Ohev Sholom - The National Synagogue in Washington, D.C., said that though terrorists misused the name of God to commit their atrocities, in many ways, 9/11 brought Jews and Muslims closer.

He will use his time in the pulpit to warn against cynicism the attacks may have allowed to creep in. ""Al Qaeda punctured our belief in ourselves, and we need to remember to ignore them. Al Qaeda’s greatest threat is not the physical, but the attack on our belief in our own destiny; they have spread disbelief and cynicism throughout our land,"" he plans to say.

""This 9/11, let us remember the dead. But let us also remember the great things we have accomplished in our history and promise ourselves that despite the evil intentions of al Qaeda, we will continue to soar for greatness.""

Charles Park is pastor of the nondenominational River Church in Manhattan. They are partnering for a joint service with the Lower Manhattan Church, which was founded after the attacks by Rick Warren's Saddleback Church as a way to minister to the community nearest to ground zero.

Both churches meet blocks from ground zero, and on Sunday, Park will speak to congregants who watched what happened 10 years ago in person; congregants who brushed the toxic dust of falling buildings off their jackets and had to move on with their daily lives.

""I will be focusing on 'how to move forward from 9/11' because as one wise person said, 'Every pain that is not transformed is transmitted,'"" Park said in an e-mail.

He will lean heavily on the prayer of St. Francis, ""to remind the people of faith the calling from God to be a 'blessing to all peoples on Earth.' ""

""Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.""","Thu, 08 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/09/08/t1larg.pulpit.jpg,"['remember', 'attack', 'sermons', 'pastor', 'god', 'church', 'churches', 'prepare', 'congregants', '911', 'service', 'anniversary', 'pastors', 'nation']",

Michele Bachmann Michele Marie BachmannBoehner says he voted for Trump, didn't push back on election claims because he's retired Boehner: Trump 'stepped all over their loyalty' by lying to followers Boehner finally calls it as he sees it MORE (R-Minn.) is pushing a $690 million local transportation project that has raised questions from government-waste watchdogs and could become a target in the GOP presidential primary.

Bachmann has sponsored legislation to authorize the construction of a four-lane bridge that would connect Stillwater, a town of about 20,000 people in her district, to the unincorporated township of Houlton, across the St. Croix River.

ADVERTISEMENT

Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that opposes wasteful federal projects, has panned the legislation as too costly, as have other critics.

Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), who represents a neighboring district, calls it “fiscally irresponsible.”

The project would cost between $610 million and $690 million, according to a congressional aide. The Minnesota Department of Transportation puts the price tag at $643 million.

The state transportation agency said $292 million of that total will go to build the new bridge, and the rest to upgrade surrounding infrastructure and tailor the project to scenic and recreation needs. It would be paid for by a mix of federal and state funding.

Some critics mutter Bachmann’s plan is akin to the infamous “Bridge to Nowhere,” the $400-billion proposed bridge that former Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) tried to build to Gravina Island, a small community off Alaska’s cost.

Government-waste watchdogs are crying hypocrisy because Bachmann positioned herself as a leading critic of federal spending who voted against legislation to raise the debt limit earlier this month.

Bachmann said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” earlier this month that the federal government should re-prioritize its spending instead of adding to its debt load.

Critics say the presidential hopeful should back up her talk by opting for a less costly replacement to the lift bridge that now connects Stillwater and Houlton.

“We’re opposed to that project because there’s a far, far cheaper alternative to the Stillwater bridge,” said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that opposes earmarks and government projects it deems wasteful.

“Why are we spending hundreds of millions more than we need to when we can get a much cheaper alternative that does the same thing?” Ellis asked. “[Bachmann] said balancing the budget is easy, we just need to prioritize spending. [She] should look in the mirror. If [choosing a cheaper alternative] is not re-prioritizing spending, I don’t know what is.”

Tom Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste, noted that more than 1,000 bridges need repairs in Minnesota.

“So one question is, ‘Why does this one take priority over others?’” he said.

Bachmann’s proposed legislation would authorize the new four-lane bridge and exempt it from the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which has blocked the major construction project.

A spokeswoman for Bachmann said the cheaper alternative touted by critics would quickly become obsolete due to growing traffic needs.

“Congresswoman Bachmann doesn’t want to see a bridge built that is obsolete before it’s completed,” Becky Rogness said.

Kevin Gutknecht, a spokesman for the Minnesota Department of Transportation, said the project is nothing akin to the “Bridge to Nowhere.”

“Stillwater is really a suburb of the Twin Cities, the biggest city in the Midwest area to the west of Chicago,” he said. “[The bridge] is to serve a much larger travel shed [than the ‘Bridge to Nowhere’].”

The controversial bill is one of the few pieces of legislation sponsored by Bachmann that has attracted Democratic support.

A local coalition, the Sensible Stillwater Bridge Partnership, wants a cheaper alternative that would not require hundreds of millions of dollars worth of additional infrastructure upgrades. At a Senate hearing last month, Roger Tomten, a member of the coalition, proposed a plan costing less than $300 million.

“Construction of this bridge could be completed in the same timeframe as the big freeway-style bridge,” he said in testimony to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources subcommittee on national parks.

Klobuchar told The Hill in an interview Friday that the $643 million project is in the best interests of her state.

She said it would take years to win regulatory approval for an alternative bridge and questioned the claim that it would cost less than $300 million.

“I represent the whole state,” she said. “I’ve weighed all those things, and the major issue is we need a new bridge. Don’t believe what they say about the cost of this new bridge. The architect alone is allowed to pick out a number.”

Klobuchar disputes concern that a major bridge expansion would cause traffic backups in McCollum’s district, another criticism of the project.

She said failure to move forward with the bridge immediately would cause federal and state funding set aside for the project to expire.

The debate has created a rift between Minnesota’s current Senate delegation and former Vice President Walter Mondale, the state’s most famous living Democratic politician. Mondale, a champion of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, opposes the plan endorsed by Klobuchar, Franken and Bachmann.

Gutknecht, the state Transportation Department spokesman, said the state government has done an extensive study, including an environmental impact statement.

“This is the option to have the least effect on the environment,” Gutknecht said. “This is the alternative that is best matched to the traffic needs and [limits] the costs to the environment.”","Sun, 28 Aug 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/bachmann_campaigning_getty_lede.jpg,"['alternative', 'million', 'bridge', 'local', 'bachmanns', 'rivals', 'bachmann', 'spending', 'legislation', 'project', 'state', 'senate', 'transportation', 'criticism', 'draw', 'republican']", 
85,85,FL-2011-000139-CHN,Outrage as Montalcino proposes blended Rosso - decanter.com,https://www.decanter.com/wine-news/outrage-as-montalcino-proposes-allowing-blended-rosso-35786/,"Proposals to allow Rosso di Montalcino to be blended with other grapes have divided the Italian wine world.

Montalcino: not to be ‘polluted’

On 7 September, Montalcino wine producers will vote on whether to split Rosso di Montalcino – the ‘second’ denomination to Brunello di Montalcino – into three tiers.

Rosso di Montalcino Sangiovese Superiore, and Rosso di Montalcino Sangiovese would both remain 100% Sangiovese, with differences in yield allowances.

A third level, Rosso di Montalcino, would have to contain a minimum of 85% Sangiovese with 15% other ‘authorised red grapes’ in the blend.

Wine critic Nicolas Belfrage MW has written an open letter urging producers ‘in the strongest terms’ to vote against the proposals.

‘The strongest factor in the identity of Rosso di Montalcino (and of course Brunello di Montalcino) is the fact that it is 100% Sangiovese,’ he writes.

‘I am convinced that it is against the long-term interests of Montalcino to allow any other grape variety… into the Rosso, just as it would be fatal to great Burgundy, for example, to allow Syrah to be blended with Pinot Noir.’

Others agree: Brunello producer Gianfranco Soldera’s comment to Decanter.com, ‘any wine that has Montalcino on the label should be made with only 100% Sangiovese,’ is typical of a flood of blog and twitter posts.

Kerin O’Keefe, wine writer and author of a forthcoming book on Brunello di Montalcino to be published by University of California press said she was ‘totally against changing Rosso di Montalcino’s production code… Adding international grapes would dumb it down and turn into just another of Tuscany’s myriad of blended Sangiovese wines.

‘Rosso is also a crucial safeguard for Brunello quality because every year most producers declassify some Brunello to Rosso. This is why consumers consider Rosso a well-priced Baby Brunello, but this would all change if the other grapes are allowed.’

At the same time, other observers counsel keeping a sense of perspective.

‘This debate has been going on since at least the 1960s,’ Dante Cecchini of renowned producer Banfi told Decanter.com.

Allowing blending, he said, would make Rosso more consistent, with the downside that that there would be less vintage variation and so less character.

‘Rosso would lose some customers, but would gain others who wanted more consistency from their wine.’

Lamberto Frescobaldi, owner Brunello estate Castelgiocondo, said he was ‘not opposed to any measure that would enhance the quality of Rosso’.

‘Sales of Rosso di Montalcino have been sluggish for the last four years, and we need to invigorate this wine because having a successful Rosso in the end means having a more successful Brunello, since only the best Sangiovese goes into Brunello.

‘But over the years, some producers have planted Sangiovese in less than suitable areas, leading to lower quality Brunello, and even lower quality Rosso. This hurts the whole denomination.’

Montalcino was mired in controversy in 2008, when sales of the 2003 Brunello di Montalcino were suspended and producers including Antinori, Frescobaldi, Argiano and Castello Banfi investigated for allegedly mixing Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, albeit in quantities of less than one per cent, into the wine.

At the time, Franco Biondi Santi, whose grandfather Ferruccio is credited with inventing Brunello in the 1880s, suggested that parts of the region were not ideal for Sangiovese.

‘In some areas the vine excels, in others it simply does not,’ he said. ‘Rather than change Brunello, we should think about allowing other red grapes, grown within the denomination, to Rosso di Montalcino.’

The Provincial Disaster Management Authority estimated that some 4.8 million people have been displaced while independent sources estimated the figure to be around 10 million people, a much larger level of devastation than the 2010 floods. Even though the Sindh government has declared these districts “calamity-hit”, so far no rescue work has begun there. Districts in lower Sindh such as Sanghar, Umerkot, Tharparkar, Badin, Thatta and Mirpurkhas were affected particularly badly.

It has reportedly been raining in Mirpurkhas district continuously for the last 40 hours and dozens of residential areas, government offices and main roads have been completely inundated by water, forcing thousands of residents to move to safer areas. In nearby Sanghar district, nine people were killed in separate incidents as the district was completely submerged under floodwater. The monsoon rains have so far taken the lives of at least 200 people in Mirpurkhas, Umerkot, Sanghar, Tharparkar, Tatha, Badin, Tando Muhmmad Khan and other districts and towns of Sindh.

The Umerkot district administration also called the army to rescue stranded people. According to locals of the town of Naukot in Tharparkar, around 10,000 people from various areas who had started moving to the desert from their native areas are stranded near the town after a bridge collapsed. Apart from destruction of standing crops, government buildings, houses, bridges, heritage sites and religious places, the rains have also caused severe shortage of food, drinking water, life-saving drugs, milk, vegetables and other essential commodities.

The rains also caused heavy damage in northern districts of the province where several villages, towns and cities were inundated and cut off from other areas. Shikarpur, Larkana, Qamber Shahdadkot, Khairpur, Nawabshah, Nowshero Feroz and Dadu all suffered heavy damage in rains. In Sihari Hatar, Kasur a shepherd named Muhammad Boota and a woman named Bashiran Bibi were killed when lightning struck a tree they were sheltering under because of the heavy rains.

Meet the amazing eight-year-old piano prodigy who is totally blind, yet has no trouble breezing through Tchaikovsky and Mozart concertos while most children her age are getting to grips with their times tables.



Naturally blessed Ying-Shan Tseng, from Boksburg in South Africa, is years ahead of her peers and only took up the piano three years ago, aged five.



And last year she excelled her competition after being named the top junior instrumentalist in the five- to 15-year-old age group at the South African Championships for Performing Arts.

Totally blind: Ying-Shan Tseng plays at her piano at the Pioneer School for the blind in Worcester, South Africa

In contrast to sighted performers who are able to read music as they play, Ying-Shan must first learn each individual piece by braille before committing it to memory.

'I cannot imagine where she stores all that information,' explained her astonished music teacher, Elize Weldhagan.



'In the first month she could do little songs that other kids can do after three or four months. She's absolutely amazing.'

Ying-Shan's mother and father, Ching-Hsuan and Ken Tseng, say they were as surprised as anyone at that daughter's outstanding talent.



Her mother said: 'I don't know where her ability has come from, but we will do all we can to help her become a professional performer.



'She has taught me so much about perseverance and dedication in the way she masters her talents.'



After spending the first years of her education in a mainstream school with sighted children, where she is said to have excelled, Ying-Shan was later moved to the National Eisteddfod Academy for performing arts.



Recently she was named the most inspiring junior performer at the school's annual awards.



Asked how she feels about her unique gift, the precocious performer says that music is like painting.

89,89,FL-2011-000139-CHN,10 Tips for Buying a Car at Auction – Popular Mechanics - Popular Mechanics,https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/a7185/10-tips-for-buying-a-car-at-auction-6390099/,"High-end classic car auctions like the Barrett-Jackson events are common on cable channels with three-digit numbers, such as Speed and HD Theater. Perfect Shelby Cobras, Ferraris with long racing pedigrees, glorious Duesenbergs, exceedingly rare muscle cars and old Mercedes roadsters so gorgeous that your eyes water cross the block and sell for insane prices.

This is not about those auctions.

This is about auctions where the cars are the most ordinary of ordinary vehicles: Ford Crown Victorias coming off six years of patrol duty with the county sheriff's department. Toyota Tercels with so much mileage that their odometers have worn off the printed numerals. Plain sedans, base model pickups and early '90s Pontiac Firebirds confiscated in drug stings. Cars you can get cheap—maybe.

Interest in these auctions has boomed as the economy stays stagnated and credit rules have tightened. Buyers who formerly could qualify for auto loans on new or solid used cars now find they need to shop with cash. But the United States is a country built around the automobile, and it's a lot easier to get a job if you have a car to drive to the interview, so for many people car auctions are a way to fill the need.

""There are two types of public auctions,"" explains Steven Lang, who runs a used car dealership in the Atlanta area and once owned a dealer auction (not open to the public). ""There are government auctions and there are public auctions."" Both are full of potential pitfalls. Here's a quick rundown on both and 10 tips for getting the most out of either. That is, if you dare to venture into the auction pit.

(Note: Online auctions like eBay are an entirely different beast, and through the use of independent inspection services, maybe even a safer bet. But that's a subject for another time. And for those of you bidding in a televised auction, we do have one piece of advice: Don't get so excited that you spill your mimosa.)

Government Auctions

""At a government auction it's, say, a county that has 30 or 40 police cruisers it needs to get rid of. And they want to sell all of it,"" Lang says. ""All the vehicles have known histories—how they were maintained, used and fixed, and their mileage is virtually always honest. You'll know what you're getting."" Still, you don't get to drive a car before you bid on it. So you'd better have a sharp eye. Make that a sharp, trained, cynical, wary, pessimistic and rabidly suspicious eye.

But the competition at county auctions is brutal and it's only getting stronger. ""Taxi companies want the old cruisers to use as cabs,"" Lang says. ""And often there are government employees who are going after a vehicle that they used on the job and grew fond of. A lot of the school buses and trucks get bought by brokers looking to ship them overseas to poorer countries that will use them for public transportation. These are guys who go to government auctions all the time, know what to pay and know a lemon when they see it. You won't be the only bargain hunter out there.""

Buying a car at government auction used to guarantee a bargain, that's not true any more. ""With the competition growing so fierce, some cars now go for more than retail,"" Lang says. ""If you're not careful, it's easy to get burned.""

Public Auctions

""Public auctions used to be good places to buy cars,"" Lang says. ""Now they're not even remotely good places to buy a car. The only people who should go to public auctions are those who are exceptional in their mechanical inclination and training. If you can't fix a car, don't go to a public auction.""

As the action at public auctions has grown hotter, the cars have grown shadier. ""I've personally seen cars with over 300,000 miles on their clocks rolled back to 120,000 and sold as 'Miles Exempt' meaning no guarantee of mileage,"" he says. ""Most of the cars at a public auction are the worst trade-ins or very rough repos."" And as in a government auction, you can't drive a public auction vehicle before you bid on it.

Cars at public auctions are often those that wouldn't sell at wholesale dealer auctions. Yes, some are flood vehicles, and Hurricane Irene should still be fresh in your mind. Some are cars quickly reconditioned in dealership shops to fill in slow periods when there's otherwise little work to be done. And many are just flat out junk. ""A car that goes across the block at a public auction that isn't spewing smoke is often packed with thick racing oil to ensure it doesn't,"" Lang continues. ""Everything at a public auction looks shiny, but shiny doesn't mean much about the quality of the car.""

This doesn't mean it's impossible to find a good car at auction; it just means it's getting harder. But if you decide to head down to an auction to gawk and possibly bid, keep these 10 tips in mind.

10 Tips for Buying a Car at Auction

1. Be Honest With Yourself

If you don't have the ability and tools to deal with whatever mechanical challenges may arise, don't talk yourself into believing otherwise. If you're looking for cheap transportation, don't let it become expensive repairs.

2. Use Your Eyes

Cars at government and public auctions sell on visual inspection alone. So look at everything and look for telltale signs of repairs such as paint overspray, less than smooth sheet metal, puddles under the vehicle, scored brake discs, an uneven stance and a million other details. Use your nose, hands and legs, too. If a car smells musty or the carpeting is wet, run away.

3. But Don't Believe Everything You See

Bondo, polish and touchup paint are cheap. Particularly at public auctions, assume every vehicle there has been rubbed on to the point that there's a reality distortion field surrounding it. Nothing is as good as it looks.

4. Don't Let the Superficial Scare You… if You're at a Government Auction

At government auctions, weathered paint may cover a mechanically sound Crown Victoria. A small dent in the tailgate of a Chevrolet Silverado may just be a parking lot thump, not signs of misuse. At public auctions, however, those may mean the car is such a basket case that no one thought it was even worth the effort to try and fool people.

5. Check the VIN

Write down the VIN from the base of the windshield for any car you're considering. Then check other places where the VIN might appear, such as door and trunk lid stickers. If the numbers don't match, the car may have been in a major accident and rebuilt. Look for more promising alternatives.

6. Pull the Dipsticks

If a car has been well-maintained, when you pull the oil or transmission fluid dipsticks the lubricants should be clear and clean.

7. Know Car Values Before You Bid

Online resources such as Kelly Blue Book and Edmunds give a general idea what used cars are worth. But also take time to research local prices on Craigslist and in classified listings. Again, pride works against you here. If you don't know about car values, don't try and fake it.

8. ""As Is"" Means ""As Is""

Vehicles at auction sell in ""as is"" condition. That means there are no guarantees, no warranties and no means of legal recourse. If you don't have the stomach to survive discovering you've bought a heap of trouble, don't bid in the first place.

9. Observe Other Bidders

Take your time and watch the action closely on all the cars up for auction. Look for suspicious actions such as bidders who seem to be active on every lot; they may just be trying to pump up the prices. Go to a few auctions before actually participating in one yourself. Get to know the players.

10. Don't Get Caught Up in the Bidding

It's easy to get carried away during bidding and wind up spending hundreds more than a car is worth. Don't pin all your hopes on one vehicle. Be ready to walk away. If you have to take the bus home afterward, it's still better than winding up with a clunker.

Nearly every morning for more than half a century, 85-year-old Ruth Ziolkowski rises around dawn, puts her feet on the ground and gives thanks she is part of a dream.



Since 1947, she has worked at the Crazy Horse monument to Native Americans in the Black Hills of South Dakota, where she is leading the effort to literally move a mountain.



'I'm tickled to death to get up every morning and go to work,' Mrs Ziolkowski, president of the non-profit Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation, said in an interview .



Stony stare: Widow Ruth Ziolkowski, 85, is continuing her scluptor husband's work, which began in 1947 and has yielded this 90-foot-tall carved granite face of Crazy Horse

Billed as the world's largest sculpture, Crazy Horse is only a 20-mile drive from better-known Mount Rushmore, where faces of presidents George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt are carved into granite.

The sculpture's final dimensions are planned to be 641 feet wide and 563 feet high. That would surpass the current biggest monument, the Spring Temple Buddha in Lushan County, Henan, China, which measures 420 feet in height.



Already, the face of Crazy Horse, which measures 87 feet in height, dwarfs the 60-feet tall faces of the presidents of Mount Rushmore.

The Crazy Horse monument's location is Pine Ridge reservation, a mostly barren land where more than half the residents live below the poverty line, according to government figures.



Pine Ridge is where many Sioux Indians of Crazy Horse's Oglala tribe were put after they were pursued by the U.S. Army, starved of the buffalo they hunted, and had their traditional lands confiscated.

Unhappy that a monument to white leaders was carved into mountains the Sioux considered sacred, Lakota Sioux elder Chief Henry Standing Bear invited to Pine Ridge Korczak Ziolkowski, who in 1939 had won the New York World's Fair sculpture prize.



They decided to carve a rival monument to Native Americans featuring Crazy Horse, a Sioux warrior who helped lead one of the most famous Indian victories over the U.S. Army - annihilating much of General George Armstrong Custer's Seventh Cavalry at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876.

Rushmore: Crazy Horse is only a 20-mile drive from better-known Mount Rushmore, where faces of presidents George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt are carved into granite

Korczak Ziolkowski began working on the granite mountain on June 3, 1948, along with volunteers including young Ruth Ross from Connecticut. Ruth and Korczak were married in 1950, and raised 10 children at the foot of Crazy Horse.



'He felt we had done them (the Indians) a terrible wrong and he wanted to right some of that wrong,' she said.



Many people thought Korczak's plan was indeed crazy.



Mount Rushmore took 14 years to complete, cost $1million at the time of which 85 per cent was government money, and used around 400 workers, according to the National Park Service.



Stubbornly independent, Korczak accepted only private donations. He sketched out a monument much larger than Mount Rushmore, with the warrior on horseback and hand outstretched.



All four of Mount Rushmore's presidential heads would fit inside just the warrior's head at Crazy Horse, said Pat Dobbs, spokesman for the monument. Korczak also wanted to carve completely around the mountain, while the presidents' faces are only on one side of Mount Rushmore.



Some Native Americans opposed the project. They said Henry Standing Bear had no authority to invite a white man to carve the monument, and said it was desecrating the Black Hills and exploiting an Indian hero. They said Crazy Horse, described in history books as a quiet man, would not have approved.



Near neighbours: The Crazy Horse monument is just 20 miles away from Mount Rushmore in South Dakota

Ongoing work: With the face of Crazy Horse just visible a workman walks under what will one day be the pointing arm of the Lakota warrior

Indian activist Russell Means said the Crazy Horse carving was like going to the Holy Land of Israel and carving on Mount Zion. 'It is an insult to our entire being.' he said in 2001.



Korczak worked virtually alone on the mountain for years and died in 1982, 16 years before the first part of the carving - the giant face of Crazy Horse - was completed in 1998.



NATIVE AMERICAN: THE LEGEND OF CRAZY HORSE

Crazy Horse was a Native American war leader of the Oglala Lakota.

He ranks among the most notable and iconic of Native American tribal members and has been honoured with a postage stamp by the U.S. Postal Service.

Crazy Horse is remembered for taking up arms against the U.S. Federal government to fight against encroachments on the territories and way of life of the Lakota people. He led a war party to overwhelming victory at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in June 1876, in which 268 U.S. troops were killed including General George Armstrong Custer.

After surrendering in 1877, Crazy Horse was fatally wounded by a military guard while allegedly resisting imprisonment at Camp Robinson in present-day Nebraska.

To this day the horse and outstretched hand of Crazy Horse are only in rough shape. Plans are to complete the horse's head next, although Ruth was careful not to give a completion date.



Whether the unfinished Crazy Horse is a monument to sheer persistence or utter futility, the project has expanded, with a visitors centre including a museum, restaurant and gift shop, and numerous events. A fundraising drive begun in 2006 netted $19.3million by end-2010, including in-kind donations.



About a million people trek to Crazy Horse every year, and the entry fees account for 40 per cent of revenues with most of the rest from private giving, Mr Dobbs said. On some days tourists can view a dynamite explosion as mountain blasting continues.



But the most important change has been an emphasis on Native American education. Ruth said her husband always dreamed an Indian University of North America would be on the site.



A dormitory has been built, and beginning in the summer of 2010, Crazy Horse provided a programme for students, some of them Native American, to work at the tourist centre and take classes such as math and writing in preparation for college.



One of those students, Dylan Tymes, who grew up on the Pine Ridge reservation, said he is hoping to start his sophomore year of college soon. Mr Tymes said Pine Ridge is a rough place, a 'ghetto,' with few jobs and many people living on food stamps.



Mr Tymes said even some of his own family were sceptical of the Crazy Horse memorial, but the education project and summer job won him over. 'If it wasn't for the Crazy Horse programme I don't think I would even be in college right now,' he said.



Some prominent Native Americans also are joining with the Ziolkowski family to help. Five of the 26 foundation board of directors are of Native American heritage.



Billy Mills, a project advisor and Lakota Sioux, who in 1964 became the only American ever to win the Olympic 10,000 metres run, said the warrior Crazy Horse was one of his boyhood idols.

After Mr Mills' mother died when he was a young boy, his father spoke of Crazy Horse to calm his son's anger and lift him from the self pity that Mills said destroys many Indians.



Mr Mills does not believe Crazy Horse would be angry about the mountain carving if he were alive but would 'use it as an opportunity to teach the world about indigenous people.'



Ruth Ziolkowski is fine with the fact that she will not see Crazy Horse finished in her lifetime. But to her nine living children, two of whom are on the foundation board and a third a foreman on the mountain directing work, she has a clear wish.

The train, which was hauling 118 empty coal cars, was travelling about 10mph, police said.



In the 911 tape, the emergency caller, who identified herself as an EMT, can be heard saying: 'Oh my God.'

She tells the dispatcher: 'I am on Third Avenue at the railroad tracks. Somebody just tried to jump on the train and severed her legs.'

'Do not move her! Don't move her!' she shouts at five people trying to help.



'There were four individuals trying to jump onto the train,' she says. 'One succeeded, the other fell and she severed her legs. Holy s***.'

The dispatcher tells the caller not to tourniquet the girl's wounds and that an ambulance is on its way.



'Don't sit her up, you guys!' the EMT tells others. 'They are trying to sit her up.'

'Lay your head back, honey,' she tells the Miss Beninati.

A second paramedic, who works with the first paramedic at Longmont United Hospital, arrives to help, putting on surgical gloves and applying femoral pressure with a t-shirt to stem the bleeding.



'She is very, very, very pale,' the first EMT says. 'She is alert. She is talking. Now she is crying.'



The dispatcher asks: 'What part of her leg was amputated? At the ankle? At the knee?'



She replies: 'Left side is amputated right below the hip.'

Miss Beninati hears this and begins to sob uncontrollably.



'Oh, I am sorry, I am sorry,' the EMT tells her. 'I shouldn't have said that right in her ear. Dammit.'

Moving: Authorities said the 100-car train was travelling at 18mph when the incident occurred near the intersection of 3rd Avenue and Atwood Street

'The other one, right leg, it looks like (it's severed) right below the knee,' she tells the dispatcher.



The dispatcher then tries to get the EMT to collect the severed legs but as they are under the train and it is still moving they decide it is too dangerous.



Instead the EMTs are instructed to continue to add pressure to wound to stop the bleeding.

The nurse who made the 911 call was too traumatised about what happened to talk publicly, 7NEWS reported.



FREIGHTHOPPING: Also known as train hopping, catching out, or hopping out.

Defined as the hitching of a ride on a railroad freight car for free.

Became popular in the U.S. after the American Civil War as the railroads began pushing westward.

Migrant workers, who became known as hobos, were the most frequent users.

As their numbers fell, freighthopping became the domain of the homeless and thrill-seekers.

It is now increasingly dangerous as the speed of the cars gets faster.

Banned in all U.S. states - but still widely carried out.



However, the other EMT, Kathy Poiry, told the station that she was just focused on keeping pressure on the girl's legs. She said she knew that if more blood was lost, the girl would die.



Miss Beninati was transported to Longmont United Hospital and then airlifted to Denver Health Medical Center, where her legs where amputated.

Her parents yesterday released a statement which thanked bystanders who went to aid their daughter at the scene.

Longmont police say Miss Beninati was trying to hop the train to get back to Fort Collins after she and three male friends had travelled to Denver, 30miles south.



A 21-year-old Broomfield man and a 17-year-old Fort Collins boy successfully got on the train before the girl tried and fell beneath the wheels, police said yesterday.



The 17-year-old boy jumped from the train, scraping his arm.



Another friend, Charlie Hamilton, 25, of Gillette, Wyoming, helped pull Miss Beninati out from under train, police said.



Mr Hamilton and the Fort Collins boy were cited for trespassing, police say. The Broomfield man left the scene and police have not been able to locate him.



Police say they do not suspect alcohol or drug use in the accident.

Miss Beninati had recently graduated from Alta High School in Sandy, Utah.



'She was really involved in art and music,' former Alta classmate Mitch Dom told ABC4.



Mr Dom told the station that Miss Beninati was very artistic and went by the nickname 'Rush' because she said she always finished projects in a hurry.

Online commentators were unsurprised by the attempt to hop on board a moving train.



'Allen E' said on the Denver Post forum: 'When I was an undergraduate @ CSU we would hitch hike between Fort Collins and Boulder on Friday to spend the weekend at Tulagi's.



'Cheap pitchers, good music. Free ride down, and free ride back.

'I have to think the kids were returning to Fort Collins the undergraduate way - free.

'To the young woman who suffered the loss, our prayers and thoughts are with you.



'No condemnation from me.

'I might have done the same thing if I knew the trains were headed for Boulder in those days.'



Longmont police commander Jeff Satur said the incident was a 'terrible' example of the danger of trying to hop a train.



He said: 'It's terrible.



'It really highlights the dangers of trying to hop a train. It is not safe by any means.'

A police investigation is ongoing.

But though the surroundings are less than glamorous, North Korea hopes to launch itself into the world of cruising with ageing liner the Mangyongbong.

The former cargo ship set sail on its maiden tour yesterday carrying about 130 passengers from the rundown port of Rajin, near the China-Russia border.

Some 500 North Koreans, about half dressed in dark workers clothes and the others in office and traditional attire, waved off the ship in a choreographed performance on the pot-holed dock.

The spectators waved North Koreans flags and fake flowers, and let off a blast of paper fireworks to mark the occasion. Carnival music blared from two minivans with speakers on their roofs.

Before the launch, vice mayor Hwang Chol-nam of Rason City, of which Rajin port is a part, gave a speech lauding the venture as part of the region’s push to attract tourism.

Hwang hailed his city’s rule which allows any nationality to visit the area visa-free. They must, however, arrange the trip through a designated tour companies. Mobile phones must be left behind in China.



'Any country, people from America, Japanese, Singaporean can come to Rason, that’s the reality today, and that’s the same for the Kumgang special economic zone,' he said.



'If any foreign companies have an interest in conducting tours they just need to contact our companies.'

The 9,700 tonne vessel then departed on its trial voyage, destination the scenic Mount Kumgang resort near the South Korean border.

During the 21-hour overnight cruise, which traced the length of North Korea's east coast, some passengers slept on wooden bunkbeds while others were assigned mattresses on the floor. Simple meals were served cafeteria-style on metal trays.

A plaque on board commemorated a 1972 tour of the boat by North Korea’s founder, late President Kim Il Sung, and bright red posters emblazoned with his sayings decorated the walls.

Officials have promised a 'more luxurious' ship capable of carrying up to 900 passengers, perhaps next year. The goal is to bring as many as 4,000 visitors a day from Rason to Mount Kumgang during the peak summer season, up from some 500 per week now.

North Korea remains far off the beaten track for tourists - especially those from the U.S. and South Korea, whose nations fought against North Korea and China during the 1950-53 Korean War.

It remains to be seen how many Chinese tourists will be interested in the new tours. With incomes rising, Chinese are traveling abroad in rising numbers, thronging tour groups to Europe, Thailand, Japan and South Korea, with a small but growing number also making the short trip to nearby North Korea.

But Wang Zhijun, a Chinese hotel manager from Jilin province who joined the trip free of charge, said it won’t be hard to sell the cruise to tourists in his region, which has a large ethnic Korean population and lacks coastline of its own.

But, he said, the price would have to stay low, suggesting around 2000 yuan (US$310) per passenger for an all-inclusive, five-day trip.

'It ought to be very popular. There are a lot of tourists already coming across to Rason,' Wang said.



'People from China’s northeast would really like this kind of trip because it’s a cruise. You can enjoy the sea.'

North Korea's move to attract foreign tourists comes amid a dispute with South Korea over their stalled joint tour programme at Mount Kumgang.



Launched in 1998, it gave tourists the chance to visit scenic Diamond Mountain through tours run by the South's Hyundai Asan Corp., which opened a spa and golf resort there in 1998.



All but a sliver of the two million visitors were South Koreans who saw it as a symbol of inter-Korean cooperation following decades of animosity.



But after a North Korean guard shot and killed a South Korean tourist in 2008, Seoul halted the reconciliation programme.

Seoul demanded that Pyongyang formally apologise and allow a joint investigation before resuming the tours that brought North Korea an estimated tens of millions in hard revenue.

But last week the North expelled the last remaining South Koreans at the resort and said it would sell of Southern assets valued at nearly $320 million in a move that prompted Seoul on Tuesday to ask others not to invest.

Earlier this month, a New York-based company said it had signed a deal with North Korea to run tours to the Kumgang resort.



A senior South Korean official said North Korea would have trouble drawing investors and tourists after the way the North dealt with South Korean businesses.","Thu, 01 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/09/01/article-2032602-0DAAFC6700000578-177_1024x615_large.jpg,"['korean', 'rason', 'korea', 'south', 'kumgang', 'launches', 'tourists', 'ship', 'cruise', 'tour', 'north', 'tours', 'liner']",
