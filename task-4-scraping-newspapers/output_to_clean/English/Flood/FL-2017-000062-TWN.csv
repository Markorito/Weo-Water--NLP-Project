0,0,FL-2017-000062-TWN,A New Formula to Help Tame China’s Yellow River - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/science/china-yellow-river-xiaolangdi-dam.html,"Each year thousands of tourists flock to a reservoir along the Yellow River in China to witness a ritual cleansing so violent that it can look as if the earth just exploded. At the end of June and the start of July, for as long as two weeks before the flood season, Chinese officials open large portals along the walls of the Xiaolangdi Dam, releasing clear and muddy water simultaneously from the reservoir above to the river below. It gushes out, and in some years clouds the color of doom ascend beyond the dam’s walls.

The Yellow River is considered the cradle of China’s civilization — but also its sorrow. Its vast floodplains coaxed people in for agriculture. Yet its violent floods have killed millions.

The precautionary purging at the Xiaolangdi Dam, which has occurred annually since 2002, is the latest high-tech attempt to prevent flooding and tame the Yellow River, which today threatens more than 80 million people. It carries sediment more concentrated than in any other river in the world — so much that tiny particles of sand and silt clog reservoirs, raise riverbeds, break levees and cause potentially catastrophic floods. During what is called the Water and Sediment Regulation Discharge Project at Xiaolangdi Dam, muddy water evacuates sediment from the reservoir, and clear water washes sand out from the channel below to reduce flood risk.

The annual purge can lower the riverbed by about six feet a year on average, but a surprising discovery about the river’s bottom, as well as its unusual capacity to carry high loads of sediment, could one day mean that the purge may not be as effective at preventing floods. In a study published last month in the journal Science Advances, researchers suggest new considerations to take into account when conducting this yearly event.","Fri, 02 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/03/science/03DAMS1/03DAMS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=af071ab5a8d70d3ac2c10c774fe08ddd46bce8f483f78f0e25668bf3da5da94b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"['floods', 'sediment', 'help', 'xiaolangdi', 'chinas', 'yellow', 'reservoir', 'water', 'dam', 'river', 'violent', 'sand', 'formula', 'tame']",

COLOMBO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Colombo Port City Company and the Chinese owned Zhongtian Construction Group have delivered relief items to families affected by the major floods and landslides which hit Sri Lanka earlier this week.

Representatives from the two companies on Friday visited the Pahiyangala Village, in southern Sri Lanka and handed over relief items to officials from the Disaster Management Center and the army, who thanked the two companies for their prompt assistance, at the Yatagampitiya Primary School which presently shelters some of the affected families.

The Colombo Port City Company donated 6,200 cups of instant noodles while the Zhongtian Construction Group donated 10 beds, 20 bags of concrete, 40 meters cloth, 100 boxes of drinking water, 30 boxes of biscuits, 24 boxes of instant noodles, five disinfectant sprays and some toys for the children.

U.H.R Upul Kumara, the disaster management relief service officer in Pahiyangala, said that he was extremely grateful for the assistance rendered by the Chinese government and the Chinese companies as relief supplies were still needed for the affected people.

Pahiyangala Village, housing around 700 families, is one of the worst affected villages when severe rains and strong winds caused devastating floods and landslides since May 26.

Army officials said around 26 people were buried when a landslide hit the area last week, while 65 houses were completely damaged.

""Our house was completely destroyed and now we live in my sister's house. There is nothing left,"" Nilanthi Dhammika, a resident in this village said.

Nilanthi thanked the Chinese government and Chinese companies for the relief and said her village symbolized the strong ties shared between China and Sri Lanka.

Nilanthi also praised officials from the Chinese owned Blue Sky Rescue Team who arrived in Sri Lanka this week and are presently in some of the worst affected areas assisting the Sri Lankan officials and forces in cleaning efforts, distributing relief and providing medical assistance.

The floods and landslides which has been the worst to hit Sri Lanka since 2003, has so far claimed 206 lives, according to the Disaster Management Center.","Sat, 03 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['chinese', 'flood', 'officials', 'victims', 'management', 'lanka', 'relief', 'affected', 'village', 'assisting', 'xinhua', 'continue', 'companies', 'sri', 'port', 'landslides']",

However, photographs of a group of students from Liupanshui Normal College in Guizhou province doing just this on June 15 went viral for all the wrong reasons.

The problem? The floodwaters were less than ankle-deep, and the students were being carried on the backs of the school's cleaning staff.

According to the China News Service, the area had been hit by heavy downpours which inundated the roads. Benches were lined up along the ground, and cleaners were deployed to carry the students to the school.

Online condemnation was swift, with many saying that the students were spoilt and ""giant babies"".

According to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), one netizen wrote: ""For kindergarten kids, it's fine, but for university students, I don't understand that!""

In 2014, a Chinese Communist Party official was sacked after photos showed him riding on another person through a flooded area in order to protect his shoes from ankle-high water.

The incident took place during a search for three primary schoolchildren who had fallen into a river in the central province of Jiangxi, the official Xinhua news agency said.

Netizens at the time were outraged, with one Weibo user saying: ""The students are missing, and still he's trying to save his damn shoes? And this kind of scumbag can become a government official?""

The river stage Tuesday morning was at 42.89 feet, .11 feet below the river’s 43-foot flood stage. It was at 42.28 feet Wednesday morning.

“Finally, slowly,” Warren County Emergency Management director John Elfer said. “It’s going to continue dropping, and by Thursday the 22nd (of June), it will be at 33.8 (feet), and that shouldn’t affect anything.”

Heavy rains in the Upper Mississippi Valley and along the Arkansas River in April and early May caused the Mississippi to reach a crest of 49 feet at Vicksburg near the end of May.

The high water forced city officials to close the flood gates at Clay and China Street streets on the river, and flooding closed several low lying roads, including streets in the Kings community and Ford Subdivision areas.

“It’s about time,” said Marty Pope, hydrologist at the National Weather Service Office in Jackson. “We have finally gotten into this where we are finally in a fall situation.”

The 28-day weather forecast, he said, indicates the river’s fall will continue, and the 16-day rainfall forecast does not show a lot of rain across the Mississippi River Basin.

“Unless we see any additional huge rains, right now it looks like it’s going to continually go down unless something really changes,” he said. “The (forecast) does have a couple of inches in the Ohio Valley, but that’s not really enough to … totally get things turned back around again.

“Everything looks pretty good, although the Steele Bayou Structure may stay closed for a little while longer,” he said. “I think there a pretty good differential between the backside water as well as in the front side. Right now, the Steele Bayou Structure is at 90.71 (riverside) and the other (landside) is at 88.4.”

Looking at the Vicksburg gauge, Pope said, “We are seeing maybe about a 4- to 5-foot fall over the next five days; if that happens, and we don’t get any significant rains in the backside area to keep the Mississippi up, that should go down in the next four to five days, and they should open that up, I would think.”

Greg Raimondo, public relations director for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, said plans are to open the Steele Bayou Structure once the river drops another 2.3 feet.

“It’s been falling about half-a foot per day, so about five days we’ll get there,” he said, adding Corps officials expect to possibly be able to open the structure about Saturday or Sunday and allow the backwater areas to drain.

“We’ll have that steady flow from there on out,” he said. “It’s not like it rushes out, it equalizes and the backwater goes down with the river.”

While some low county roads remained flooded, Elfer said, water has receded from the streets in Kings and Ford.

He said the area survived the flooding with no major damage to homes in the area.

“We mitigated all those flood properties after the 2011 flood, and either they were torn down, moved or were elevated, so that was the reason we didn’t have any flooded homes that I’m aware of,” he said.

The deal, signed by 195 countries, is crucial for Africa, given the far-ranging impact of harmful greenhouse gases. The continent emits a paltry amount of harmful gasses, yet is particularly vulnerable to global warming and its effects. At 3.8%, Africa accounts for the smallest share of global greenhouse gas emissions, in contrast to 23% in China, 19% in the US, and 13% in the European Union.

Climate change in Africa is manifest in rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, and changes in rainfall patterns leading to floods or severe droughts. Since 1970, Africa has experienced more than 2,000 natural disasters, with just under half taking place in the last decade. Africa also contains 7 out of the 10 countries that are considered the most threatened by climate change globally, according to the Africa Growth Initiative at Brookings Institution. The extreme weather events are also taking a toll on African cities—which are growing rapidly—and is threatening the livelihoods of millions of people across the continent.

Abidjan, Côte D’Ivore

Global warming is a critical problem facing the Ivorian commercial capital, Abidjan. With its location on the coast of the Atlantic, experts have long warned that the city could be flooded over several decades from now. The Intergovernmental panel on climate change has also reported high erosion rates in the areas off the Abidjan harbor. The loss of mangrove forests has also increased the vulnerability of coastal areas to damages from coastal storm surges.

As the world’s top cocoa grower, heavy rains are threatening the mid-crop marketing season on one end, while farmers in other parts of the country are reporting patchy rainfalls and sunny spells.

Cape Town & Durban, South Africa

The two big South African coastal cities are among Africa’s top tourist destinations, attracting millions of people from all over the world. Yet, rising sea levels, sand movement along the coast, increasing urbanization, and the significant loss and extinction of important biodiversity underscore the challenges of climate change.

In early March, Cape Town was declared a disaster area after officials noted that the city had barely 100 days of water left due to a biting drought. The risk of catastrophic fires has also increased, with more wildfires raging in the Western Cape province. Climate change is also affecting agricultural production and is contributing to food insecurity, environmental degradation, and unemployment.

Lagos, Nigeria

Given its low-lying position next to the Atlantic Ocean, Africa’s most-populous city is susceptible to the negative impacts of climate change. Lagos consists of a mainland and a series of islands with an estimated population of 21 million—some of whom live on waterfront slums with no proper drainage or water systems. With heavy rainfalls and rising sea levels, these slum residents, and many middle to upper middle income neighborhoods, are vulnerable to flooding.

AP Photo/Sunday Alamba People walk along flooded streets after a heavy downpour in Lagos

The megacity has been trying to avert this, with innovators building a solar-powered, naturally ventilated, triangular-shaped school as a sustainable model. The Eko Atlantic Island is also being built as a new financial hub by dredging up millions of tons of sand from the Atlantic and filing it in 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) worth of land. The Great Wall of Lagos, an 8-kilometer wall is being built to protect the peninsula and its residents from the sea. Researchers have however noted that the wall could prove problematic for other waterfront dwellers, and are calling its exclusivity to certain elites as “climate apartheid.”

Dar es Salaam, Tanzania

Tanzania is the most flood-affected country in east Africa, according to the World Bank. The country’s largest city, Dar es Salaam, is growing so fast—85% by 2025—that it cannot preserve the city’s natural environment at the same time. The coastal city’s flat nature also makes it prone to floods, which are expected to come with increased rainfalls and storm surges. The slums located along the floodplains of the Msimbazi river are also vulnerable to floods, with annual structure losses expected to be $47.3 million.

Just last month, the country experienced heavy downpours that destroyed critical infrastructure, large swathes of rice farms, and led to the closure of schools. Dar es Salaam recorded 54 millimeters of rain in a day—nearly a third of the total average monthly May rainfall of 188mm.

Coastal cities of North Africa

Researchers have found that climate change could make sections of north Africa so warm as to be uninhabitable in the future. Today, major North African coastal cities like Alexandria, Casablanca, Tripoli and Tunis are all vulnerable to long term impacts of climate change.

One northern Africa country that is facing a disastrous prospect is Sudan, where average temperatures by 2060 are expected to rise between 1.5 and 3 degrees Celsius. Haphazard rains, increasing desertification, intense droughts, and erratic rains have also contributed to ruining harvests and livestock. Decades of deforestation have also led to increased dust storms that roll through the desert now and swallow entire villages and farmlands.","Fri, 02 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rtx1v2uy-e1496408889162.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['cities', 'heavy', 'africa', 'vulnerable', 'change', 'african', 'sea', 'es', 'climate', 'country', 'increased', 'coastal']",

* Three Chinese Navy ships arrive at Sri Lanka's Colombo port with flood relief

Thu, Jun 1, 2017, 12:54 pm SL Time, ColomboPage News Desk, Sri Lanka.

June 01, Colombo: Three ships of the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLA Navy) arrived at port of Colombo on Wednesday to render assistance to Sri Lanka's rescue and relief operations following the devastating floods and landslides.

The ships which were initially on a goodwill, subsequently focused their intentions on relief efforts to help the general public battered by inclement weather, Sri Lanka Navy media said.

Five teams of medical personnel along with 10 small boats aboard these ships, are expected to be deployed in relief operations in close collaboration with the Sri Lanka Navy.

Sri Lanka Navy welcomed the three PLA Navy ships, Changchun, Jing Zhou and Chao Hu in accordance with naval traditions on their arrival. They are steered by Captain Hu Jie, Captain Wang Hongbing and Captain Zhou Baojun respectively, being the Commanding Officers.

Chang Chun has a complement of 200 naval personnel onboard including 100 officers. Meanwhile there are 178 naval personnel including 50 officers aboard Jing Zhou. Chao Hu consists of a crew of 133 naval personnel together with 54 officers.

The Commanding Officers of the visiting ships called on Commander Western Naval Area, Rear Admiral Niraja Attygalle at the Western Naval Command Head Quarters and they held cordial discussions on matters of the official visit and most importantly the possible relief missions to be carried out focusing the affected community.

The Ambassador of People's Republic of China in Sri Lanka, Yi Xianliang, senior officers from the Naval Headquarters, Defense Attaché of the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka, Senior Colonel Xu Jianwei and senior officers of the ships were present on the occasion.

Subsequently, the Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne made a visit onboard ships this evening. A large consignment of relief materials dispatched by the Chinese Government was officially handed over to the Commander of the Navy.

10,10,FL-2017-000062-TWN,Bangkok struggles to protect slum dwellers as floods worsen - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-floods-bangkok-idUSKBN19A0KL,"BANGKOK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In Phrom Samrit, a squatter settlement along a major canal in Bangkok, most of the 300 households live cheek by jowl and have become used to floods after living next to water all their lives. But now their resilience is being chipped away, says Adirak Sangnut, the slum’s elected leader.

“Before, it started flooding after raining for three days. But now, it floods after just three hours of rain,” the 47-year-old said. “After a while, if nothing is done, it’ll be less than an hour before it starts flooding.”

As Thailand’s rainy season gets underway, residents in and around Bangkok say they are experiencing more intense and frequent seasonal floods since 2011, when the capital was hit by its worst flooding in half a century.

That flood disaster - caused by factors including an unusually heavy monsoon, building on flood plains and changes in water management - affected millions of people and caused $45.7 billion in losses.

Experts do not expect floods of that magnitude again any time soon but say the city’s low-lying location, continued urbanization and extreme weather linked to climate change are raising Bangkok’s vulnerability to floods.

The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) is planning 28 flood protection projects worth nearly 26 billion baht ($765.6 million).

They include dredging and expanding canals, and constructing flood barriers and water retention areas to drain and divert floodwater to Thailand’s main conduit, the Chao Phraya River.

The budget for four projects to build embankments along canals has already been approved, and an extra 2 billion baht from the military government is being used to carve out giant underground tunnels, said Vallop Suwandee, chairman of an advisory group to the Bangkok governor.

The city also issued a resilience strategy earlier this year that includes improved weather forecasts and drainage systems.

Yet not everyone approves of the BMA’s plans. Adirak says nearly half of his neighbours, who live near Don Muang airport, disagree with the canal works, fearing they will lose their homes.

Experts have criticized the plans for focusing too much on hard infrastructure solutions which they say are costly and will never be adequate.

Barriers such as flood walls could trap rainwater, worsening flash floods, and create a two-tier system where some areas are protected at the expense of others, usually the urban poor and those in neighboring provinces, they add.

But Vallop said climate change makes it imperative for Bangkok to prepare.

“It’s necessary for Bangkok and Thailand to invest in infrastructure. If we do not do it now, the damage may cost a lot more in the future,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The city government has warned investors and home-owners whose properties are on major floodways - spillover channels for floodwater - but they have built there anyway, he added.

Deputy government spokesman Lieutenant-General Werachon Sukhondhapatipak said Bangkok lacks effective infrastructure to handle large-scale flooding.

Problems include inadequate town planning, construction blocking waterways and littering of drainage systems, he said by email. “Effective flood management requires genuine cooperation from all sides,” he added.

UNEVEN EXPOSURE

In the aftermath of the 2011 floods, the government unveiled a much-criticized $11-billion flood prevention plan, which was scrapped after the military coup of May 2014.

Despite Thailand’s frequent cycle of floods and droughts, its approach to water management has always been piecemeal, said Nipon Poapongsakorn of the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI).

Whenever a disaster hits, committees are set up, but they soon disappear, leaving no institutional memory. The absence of a single water agency and a national water law are other major challenges, he added.

In Siriwan Klai-iam’s neighborhood of Bang Bua Thong market in Nonthaburi, a province to the north of Bangkok, flooding has become more common since 2011. Then water reached chest height, and her home and workplace were submerged for nearly three months.

“It’s happening every monsoon,” said the 39-year-old, pointing at the road outside that was flooded again in early June. “The government helps sometimes... but mostly after the floods.”

Danny Marks, a researcher on urban climate resilience in Southeast Asia at the University of Toronto, said neighborhoods like Siriwan’s could be adversely affected by the BMA’s plans.

The main government response has been to construct more and higher flood walls and other infrastructure rather than significantly improve water management, data collection and land-use planning, said Marks, whose doctoral thesis examined the authorities’ handling of the 2011 floods.

Flood walls create uneven exposure to future flooding, he added, with urban economic areas protected while marginalized groups such as farmers, fishermen and rural communities are exposed to losses and damage.

The TDRI’s Nipon said Bangkok needs to become a “sponge city” - a concept promoted by China where infrastructure, including pavements and green roofs, is designed to absorb water.

RISING RISKS

When Bangkok became Thailand’s capital in 1782, it was a backwater village crisscrossed by canals known as the “Venice of the East”. But many were filled in to make way for cars, while squatter settlements have encroached on others.

With that, Bangkok lost much of its drainage capacity.

“It’s easier to fill canals instead of appropriating land, but now we are paying a very high price,” said Apichart Anukularmphai, president of the Thailand Water Resources Association.

Many also blame slum residents for throwing trash into the canals and blocking the waterways, calling for them to be evicted.

There are hundreds of such communities in Bangkok and they cannot all be dismantled, said Thipparat Noppaladarom, advisor to the Community Organizations Development Institute (CODI), a government agency that upgrades slums.

CODI is currently working with residents along a major canal that is being expanded. They will be relocated to higher ground but still live in the same area - a “win-win” situation, said Thipparat.

The complexity of acquiring land for infrastructure projects is a familiar challenge to Thongchai Roachanakanan, an urban planning expert at the Department of Town and Country Planning and Public Works.

He designed a floodway after 2011, but almost all the governors he met rejected the plan because much of the land was owned by the rich and powerful.

Meanwhile, Bangkok is becoming more vulnerable each year, he added.

Thongchai is particularly concerned about flood walls to the east of the ancient capital Ayutthaya, north of Bangkok. Built after 2011, these walls - some as high as 6 meters (19.7 ft) - could cause problems should a major storm hit central Thailand, he said.

If that happens, the water could flow south fast, threatening Bangkok’s two international airports, he warned.

Sailing may have been the best way to get to work in Shenzhen on Tuesday morning, as torrential rain flooded thoroughfares, overpasses and the city's biggest subway interchange station.

The rains came as Typhoon Merbok made landfall on Monday night.

From 7 am on Monday to 7 am on Tuesday, Shenzhen reported average precipitation of 8.1 centimeters, with 21.9 cm of rain dumped in the typhoon zone, the city's flood control and drought relief headquarters said.

The rain led to severe traffic jams during the morning rush hour. Zhuang Man'er, a white-collar worker in Shenzhen, spent about two hours driving to work - a trip that usually takes her half an hour.

""Many cars drove very slowly because of the rain, but I still saw three cars collide on my way,"" she said. ""Most of my colleagues spent more than two hours on the way to the office today.""

Merbok landed on the city's Dapeng Peninsula around 11 pm on Monday, packing winds up to 83 kilometers per hour. The city's greenery management department had cleared 258 fallen trees by 9 am on Tuesday.

More than 100,000 people had been evacuated as of Tuesday morning, according to Xinhua News Agency. Those taken to safety included people who work outdoors or who live in old, at-risk houses or prefabricated structures. The city said it had not received any reports of casualties or major losses.

The typhoon was downgraded to a tropical storm after making landfall and moved into Jiangxi province early Tuesday morning. The national meteorological center lifted its blue alert for typhoon by 6 pm but still maintained the yellow alert for torrential rain.

Downpours will hit the eastern and southern regions of Guangdong and Fujian provinces, Jiangxi province and Taiwan from Tuesday night to Wednesday night, the national observatory predicted.

Since Friday, before Merbok hit China, areas south of the Yangtze River and Yunnan and Guizhou provinces had been experiencing continuous rain. Six people were killed in Hubei province as of Tuesday.","Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",http://image.cns.com.cn/ecns_editor/transform/20180524/MhcQ-fyurawh6563719.jpg,"['merbok', 'floods', 'typhoon', 'morning', 'way', 'major', 'province', 'rain', 'work', 'shenzhen', 'citys', 'traffic', 'roads']", 
12,12,FL-2017-000062-TWN,"Rare US floods to become the norm if emissions aren't cut, study warns - The Guardian",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/07/us-coastal-flooding-carbon-emissions-study,"US coastal areas are set to be deluged by far more frequent and severe flooding events if greenhouse gas emissions aren’t slashed, with rare floods becoming the norm for places such as New York City, Seattle and San Diego, new research has found.

The study, undertaken by researchers from Princeton and Rutgers universities, found that along all of the US coastline, the average risk of a 100-year flood will increase 40-fold by 2050.

Such floods are statistically expected to occur only once every 100 years because of their severity, although this doesn’t mean these sort of floods never happen in consecutive years. The annual chance of such a flood is around 1%.

The research found that if emissions are not curbed, San Francisco and Seattle would both get a 100-year flood every year by 2050, while San Diego would expect 10 such events annually and Key West in Florida would be hit 11 times a year. Some of the worst affected areas would be in Hawaii, with Mokuoloe island, situated off Oahu, forecast to be deluged by 130 floods a year that are currently considered to be 100-year events.

Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton climate scientist and co-author of the paper, added that New York City is set to get a 100-year flood every 20 years by 2050 but this frequency would leap to a large flood every other month by 2100.

“Most coastal areas will experience relatively large increases in flooding events,” he said. “A 40-fold increase on average is gigantic – cities may not be able to defend themselves. They will have to spend a lot of money or there will be quite a lot of damage.

“Many cities are already behind the eight-ball in terms of preparing for flooding. There will have to be a hard headed look at whether some areas can be defended or will have to be abandoned. Cities are only just starting to grapple with this.”

The projections are based upon “business as usual” emissions where the world does little to constrain the release of heat-trapping gases from electricity generation, transportation and other activities.

In 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted a 1-3ft rise in sea levels by the end of the century if emissions aren’t properly addressed, although more recent research on the melting and break up of parts of west Antarctica suggests that this increase could be doubled.

Sea level rise of just a few centimeters is enough to significantly raise the risk of flooding, with the problem exacerbated by an increase in the severity of storms due to a warming, moisture-laden atmosphere.

Furthermore, parts of eastern states such as New Jersey, Virginia and Florida are gradually sinking, amplifying the extent of sea-level rise. It’s now common for places such as Atlantic City and Miami Beach to experience “sunny day” flooding, where high tides cause streets to be soaked.

The Princeton and Rutgers research found stark flooding variations along the US coast. The eastern seaboard and Gulf of Mexico coast are forecast to suffer a larger amplification of moderate floods, such as those expected every year or every 10 years, rather than more severe floods.

The Pacific coast, meanwhile, is set to experience more of the rarer events, such as 500-year floods. There has been a recent spike in 500-year floods, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), such as the disaster that befell Louisiana last summer. Storms of the magnitude of Hurricane Sandy, which hit New York in 2012, also bring floods expected once in every 500 years, or more.

Lead author Maya Buchanan, from Princeton University, said coastal flooding is “responsible for loss of life and property, as well as long-term damage to local and regional economies and municipal services.”

Buchanan added that working out the future frequency of flooding is “particularly important because coastal infrastructure management, federal flood insurance, and flood risk communications are typically tied to estimates of flood return periods.”

In January, Noaa, along with several other federal agencies and universities, predicted that the oceans could rise by an average of more than 8ft by 2100 under the worst-case climate scenario. This is around 20 inches more than a previous federal estimate published in 2012. The best case scenario is now an average of about a foot in sea level rise.

Rising sea levels could displace millions of Americans this century, with US coastal cities badly situated for the looming crisis. In 2013, the World Bank said that of the 10 cities around the globe most at risk of damage from sea-level rise, half are in the US – Miami, New York, New Orleans, Tampa and Boston.

The scale of the global challenge posed by sea level rise was outlined in a study from the University of Illinois at Chicago last month, with researchers predicting there will be doubling in the frequency of severe coastal flooding.

The research found that cities in Brazil and western Africa were particularly vulnerable, as well as small Pacific islands. Climate change is causing the seas to rise by around 3.5mm a year, as the ice caps melt and oceans warm and expand.","Wed, 07 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aa3f0b0b1c6ee599dbe2ee119f9a506c9ba4e21/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=90ee8b91347f51c250c5061f9c104d12,"['norm', 'flood', 'floods', 'rare', 'study', 'arent', 'cities', 'emissions', 'research', 'rise', 'cut', 'warns', 'sea', 'risk', 'york', 'flooding', 'coastal']",

The World Is Watching. - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/15/world/europe/climate-change-rotterdam.html,"ROTTERDAM, the Netherlands — The wind over the canal stirred up whitecaps and rattled cafe umbrellas. Rowers strained toward a finish line and spectators hugged the shore. Henk Ovink, hawkish, wiry, head shaved, watched from a V.I.P. deck, one eye on the boats, the other, as usual, on his phone.

Mr. Ovink is the country’s globe-trotting salesman in chief for Dutch expertise on rising water and climate change. Like cheese in France or cars in Germany, climate change is a business in the Netherlands. Month in, month out, delegations from as far away as Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, New York and New Orleans make the rounds in the port city of Rotterdam. They often end up hiring Dutch firms, which dominate the global market in high-tech engineering and water management.

That’s because from the first moment settlers in this small nation started pumping water to clear land for farms and houses, water has been the central, existential fact of life in the Netherlands, a daily matter of survival and national identity. No place in Europe is under greater threat than this waterlogged country on the edge of the Continent. Much of the nation sits below sea level and is gradually sinking. Now climate change brings the prospect of rising tides and fiercer storms.

From a Dutch mind-set, climate change is not a hypothetical or a drag on the economy, but an opportunity. While the Trump administration withdraws from the Paris accord, the Dutch are pioneering a singular way forward.

It is, in essence, to let water in, where possible, not hope to subdue Mother Nature: to live with the water, rather than struggle to defeat it. The Dutch devise lakes, garages, parks and plazas that are a boon to daily life but also double as enormous reservoirs for when the seas and rivers spill over. You may wish to pretend that rising seas are a hoax perpetrated by scientists and a gullible news media. Or you can build barriers galore. But in the end, neither will provide adequate defense, the Dutch say.

And what holds true for managing climate change applies to the social fabric, too. Environmental and social resilience should go hand in hand, officials here believe, improving neighborhoods, spreading equity and taming water during catastrophes. Climate adaptation, if addressed head-on and properly, ought to yield a stronger, richer state.

This is the message the Dutch have been taking out into the world. Dutch consultants advising the Bangladeshi authorities about emergency shelters and evacuation routes recently helped reduce the numbers of deaths suffered in recent floods to “hundreds instead of thousands,” according to Mr. Ovink.

“That’s what we’re trying to do,” he said. “You can say we are marketing our expertise, but thousands of people die every year because of rising water, and the world is failing collectively to deal with the crisis, losing money and lives.” He ticks off the latest findings: 2016 was the warmest year on record; global sea levels rose to new highs.

He proudly shows off the new rowing course just outside Rotterdam, where the World Rowing Championships were staged last summer. The course forms part of an area called the Eendragtspolder, a 22-acre patchwork of reclaimed fields and canals — a prime example of a site built as a public amenity that collects floodwater in emergencies. It is near the lowest point in the Netherlands, about 20 feet below sea level. With its bike paths and water sports, the Eendragtspolder has become a popular retreat. Now it also serves as a reservoir for the Rotte River Basin when the nearby Rhine overflows, which, because of climate change, it’s expected to do every decade.

The project is among dozens in a nationwide program, years in the making, called Room for the River, which overturned centuries-old strategies of seizing territory from rivers and canals to build dams and dikes. The Netherlands effectively occupies the gutter of Europe, a lowlands bounded on one end by the North Sea, into which immense rivers like the Rhine and the Meuse flow from Germany, Belgium and France. Dutch thinking changed after floods forced hundreds of thousands to evacuate during the 1990s. The floods “were a wake-up call to give back to the rivers some of the room we had taken,” as Harold van Waveren, a senior government adviser, recently explained.

“We can’t just keep building higher levees, because we will end up living behind 10-meter walls,” he said. “We need to give the rivers more places to flow. Protection against climate change is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain, and the chain in our case includes not just the big gates and dams at the sea but a whole philosophy of spatial planning, crisis management, children’s education, online apps and public spaces.”

Mr. van Waveren was talking about a national GPS-guided app created so that residents always know exactly how far below sea level they are. To use public pools unrestricted, Dutch children must first earn diplomas that require swimming in their clothes and shoes. “It’s a basic part of our culture, like riding a bike,” Rem Koolhaas, the Dutch architect, told me.

In the Netherlands, scholarly articles about changes to the Arctic ice cap make front-page headlines. Long before climate change deniers began to campaign against science in the United States, Dutch engineers were preparing for apocalyptic, once-every-10,000-years storms. “For us, climate change is beyond ideology,” said Rotterdam’s mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb. He took me one morning around new waterfront development in a formerly poor, industrial neighborhood, to show how urban renewal dovetails with strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change.

“If there is a shooting in a bar, I am asked a million questions,” Mr. Aboutaleb said of his city. “But if I say everyone should own a boat because we predict a tremendous increase in the intensity of rain, nobody questions the politics. Rotterdam lies in the most vulnerable part of the Netherlands, both economically and geographically. If the water comes in, from the rivers or the sea, we can evacuate maybe 15 out of 100 people. So evacuation isn’t an option. We can escape only into high buildings. We have no choice. We must learn to live with water.”

A Moroccan-born Muslim and a rising star in the Dutch political world who denounces religious radicals and reactionary nationalists alike, the mayor runs a traditionally tough, working-class city. Rotterdam today is anything but a paradise. It is riven by social fissures and discord over immigration. But it has begun to improve in recent years as it has become greener and more diverse. When asked about climate threats, the mayor talks about creating a less divided, more attractive, healthier city — more capable of facing the stresses climate change imposes on society.

“That’s just common sense,” Mr. Aboutaleb said. The Eendragtspolder is one example, he pointed out, repaying Rotterdam’s investment with green spaces and the rowing course, which has the added perk of aiding a prospective Dutch bid for the 2028 Olympics.

Leveled by bombs during World War II, Rotterdam is not quaint and touristic like Amsterdam but industrial, down to earth, a surprisingly stylish sleeper among Europe’s cultural hubs, with a legacy of radical architecture, attracting young designers and entrepreneurs. Its tradition of openness has made it a magnet for outsiders and helped it recover from years of hardship, when, during the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, it became notoriously crime-ridden and filthy, a place wealthy people fled.

Lately the city, accustomed to starting over, has reinvented itself as a capital of enterprise and environmental ingenuity. It has pioneered the construction of facilities like those parking garages that become emergency reservoirs, ensuring that the city can prevent sewage overflow from storms now predicted to happen every five or 10 years. It has installed plazas with fountains, gardens and basketball courts in underserved neighborhoods that can act as retention ponds. It has reimagined its harbors and stretches of its formerly industrial waterfront as incubators for new businesses, schools, housing and parks.

These are all stops on the standard tour for visiting foreign delegations: proof-of-concept urban interventions, if not actually all-encompassing solutions, that address climate threats in ways that incrementally serve the economy and social needs.

“A smart city has to have a comprehensive, holistic vision beyond levees and gates,” as Arnoud Molenaar, the city’s climate chief, put it. “The challenge of climate adaptation is to include safety, sewers, housing, roads, emergency services. You need public awareness. You also need cyber-resilience, because the next challenge in climate safety is cybersafety. You can’t have vulnerable systems that control your sea gates and bridges and sewers. And you need good policies, big and small.

“This starts with little things, like getting people to remove the concrete pavement from their gardens so the soil underneath absorbs rainwater,” Mr. Molenaar said. “It ends with the giant storm surge barrier at the North Sea.”

A Vast Floodgate

That would be the Maeslantkering, built near the mouth of the sea, about a half-hour drive west from downtown Rotterdam — the city’s first line of defense. It is the size of two tubular Eiffel Towers, toppled over.

In the 20 years since it opened, the Maeslantkering hasn’t actually been needed to prevent a flood, but it is tested regularly just in case. Picnickers line the shore to watch. The trial closings are a little like the Dutch version of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.

I drove with Mr. van Waveren to see it one day. It is not uncommon here to witness the astonishing sight of ships cruising by overhead. This happens in a country where the highways are frequently below sea level.

The Maeslantkering is a consequence of repeated historic calamities. In 1916, the North Sea overwhelmed the Dutch coastline, inaugurating a spate of protective construction that failed to hold back the water in 1953 when an overnight storm killed more than 1,800 people. The Dutch still call it the Disaster. They redoubled national efforts, inaugurating the Delta Works project that dammed two major waterways and produced the Maeslantkering — the giant sea gate, completed in 1997, keeping open the immense waterway that services the entire port of Rotterdam.

Protecting the port is paramount. Once the world’s busiest, Rotterdam’s port remains the most important in Europe, each year serving tens of thousands of ships from around the world, supplying steel to Germany, petrochemicals to South America and pretty much everything else to everywhere. The port is still the bedrock industry in this city of more than 600,000, according to port officials, accounting for 90,000 jobs, not to mention another 90,000 workers whose businesses depend on the port, too.

The port supports five oil refineries, whose owners include Shell and the Koch brothers, along with a massive coal-fire power plant. Officials say the port accounts for 17 percent of the entire nation’s carbon footprint. A central paradox — and to skeptics, the ultimate hypocrisy — of this city’s environmental self-branding is that, at heart, Rotterdam’s economy continues to rely on the fossil fuel industry.

How the port eventually transitions to a greener economy, authorities concede, is the greatest challenge they face, along with climate change. They describe plans for immense wind farms in the North Sea and strategies to capture heat from fuel-burning factories to warm the greenhouses that supply the country’s agricultural yield. The Netherlands exports nearly $100 billion a year in agricultural products, second only to the United States.

In any case, the safe transport of all those raw materials, not to mention the responsibility of keeping the feet of people in the city dry, now and in the future, depends on the Maeslantkering.

The idea behind it, first discussed decades ago, was unprecedented — a monumental gate with two arms, resting on either side of the canal, each arm as tall and twice as heavy as the Eiffel Tower. It was a staggering work of engineering. Wim Quist, the architect, devised an object of surpassing beauty, one of modern Europe’s lesser-known marvels.

Mr. van Waveren described how it works. When the gate is closed, the arms float out onto the canal, meet and lock, the tubes filling with water and sinking onto a concrete bed, making an impenetrable steel wall against the North Sea. The process takes two and a half hours. Pressure from the sea is then transferred from the wall to the largest ball joints in the world, embedded in the banks on either side of the river.

Computers, using a closed electronic system to avoid cyberattack, monitor sea levels hourly and can shut the gate automatically — or open it. This is critical: Thirty pumps inside the gate are linked to one of the country’s power grids. They extract water from the tubes when it is time for the Maeslantkering to be reopened.

If the grid fails, there is a backup grid and, as a last resort, a generator, because even more dangerous than the gate’s not closing is the gate’s not reopening. In that case, water pouring down from the Rhine and Meuse rivers could not flow into the sea and would overwhelm Rotterdam even more swiftly than the North Sea could. As Mr. Aboutaleb noted, escape would be impossible.

Mr. Ovink said only half-jokingly, “the last resort would be to blow it up.” The Maeslantkering was clearly built with Hollywood disaster-movie scenarios in mind: There are redundancies to redundancies, and the barrier is prepared for the most extreme climate change models, with sea levels rising beyond current forecasts.

Even so, Rotterdam port officials have plans underway to add another two feet to the height of the gate.

Reshaping Neighborhoods

Beyond the Maeslantkering, back in town, there are countless fortifications, big and small, knitted into streets and squares. One sunny afternoon, I met Wynand Dassen, manager of Rotterdam’s resilience team, and Paul van Roosmalen, who oversees rooftop development for the city, at the Dakpark, a dike in a poor, largely immigrant neighborhood bordering industrial waterfront. The site of the Dakpark used to be a railway switching station, a grim nowhere place abutting a cluster of social housing blocks. This was a red-light district, notorious for drug dealers and crime.

The dike does a lot more than just hold back water. It has a shopping center, which the neighborhood needed, and a park on the roof. Shops face the waterfront and help pay to keep up the park. The park slopes from the roof down to streets and housing blocks, creating a grassy hill that links park and neighborhood.

When the weather is good, sunbathers sprawl on the grassy roof and toss Frisbees. Formal gardens open onto acres of well-kept lawns. The park is a kilometer long. And wonderful. Its success — not only as a barrier but also as a boon to business and the area — has persuaded officials to consult neighborhoods and set aside money for community-initiated projects. “We became invested in getting more people involved in all kinds of civic issues,” Mr. Dassen told me, “and water inevitably becomes an integral part of this process. We believe you get the smartest solutions when communities are engaged and help make the links between water and neighborhood development.”

Mr. van Roosmalen agreed. “It’s an example of what you can do if you connect storm-water management with social welfare and neighborhood improvements,” he said. “It’s what we mean here in Rotterdam by ‘resilience planning.’”

In a neighborhood nearby, where drug addicts used to trek all the way from France to buy cheap heroin, I came across Marleen ten Vergert, a single parent supporting a young daughter on a civil servant’s modest salary. Women in hijabs lugged groceries, old men lounged on park benches and children rode skateboards over broken concrete paths, past aged housing blocks. One block of houses surrounded a water plaza created to capture floodwater. Young families were enticed by prices of a single euro to buy abandoned houses around it. Many families came and went. The water park was vandalized. But, slowly, little by little, it has come to be embraced by the neighborhood.

“Now, for the most part, it works,” Ms. Vergert told me. “People want the water square, so they take better care of it. There’s a greenhouse nearby run by a Turkish community. The value of houses in the neighborhood has gone up.”

A few blocks away, a start-up in a converted industrial waterfront building is developing solar-powered sailing drones for collecting plastic trash from the sea, and, back in the middle of the city, a warehouse with a Brooklynesque mix of artisanal food stalls, a circus academy and a pinball museum has rejuvenated a formerly dingy pier. Where the old Hotel New York, a century-old landmark, used to be the tallest building along a stretch of waterfront, skyscrapers have sprung up, producing a whole new business district in Rotterdam, with a photography museum across the street from the city’s signature office tower, De Rotterdam, by Mr. Koolhaas, and Ben van Berkel’s harplike Erasmus Bridge.

Rotterdam is clearly trying to cast itself as a model of inventive urbanism. A local businessman, Peter van Wingerden, envisions floating dairy farms along the waterfront. One in every three trucks coming into the city carries food, he said. Floating farms would reduce truck traffic and carbon emissions, supplying the city with its own milk. With the city’s encouragement, he is constructing a $2.2 million prototype, for 40 cows, producing a half-million liters (about 130,000 gallons) of milk a year. “The river is no longer just for industry,” he told me. “We need to find new uses, which keep us safe from climate change, and help the city grow and prosper.”

That’s the city’s mantra. When I asked Mr. van Wingerden if it was unsettling to live in a waterfront city mostly below sea level, he said: “It seems to us less dangerous than living on the San Andreas Fault. At least when we flood, we’ll have some warning before our feet get wet.”

To the Dutch, what’s truly incomprehensible, he added, is New York after Hurricane Sandy, where too little has been done to prepare for the next disaster. People in the Netherlands believe that the places with the most people and the most to lose economically should get the most protection.

The idea that a global economic hub like Lower Manhattan flooded during Hurricane Sandy, costing the public billions of dollars, yet still has so few protections, leaves climate experts here dumbfounded.

18,18,FL-2017-000062-TWN,Tanzania seeks to protect cities from climate threats with urban plan - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tanzania-climatechange-cities-idUSKBN18T1UX,"DAR ES SALAAM (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Tanzania aims to better protect its city dwellers from floods and other climate-related threats through an urban resilience program launched this week.

The initiative comes as the country is grappling with the worsening impacts of climate change, such as frequent flooding and recurring drought.

More than half the world’s population now lives in cities, and the United Nations projects that share will rise to 66 percent by 2050, with close to 90 percent of the increase taking place in urban areas of Africa and Asia.

While this growth will globally create wealth and reduce poverty, analysts say many cities are increasingly vulnerable to flooding, putting lives and property at risk.

In East Africa, Tanzania is bearing the heaviest burden of flooding, which threatens infrastructure assets worth $5.3 billion in Dar es Salaam, the World Bank said at the launch of Tanzania’s urban program on Wednesday.

Home to more than 4.5 million people, the nation’s commercial capital is vulnerable to flooding, which cripples the ability of poorer city residents to access clean water and better sanitation, officials said.

The new initiative, a collaboration between Britain’s Department for International Development, the World Bank and the Tanzanian government, aims to find ways to cushion people from weather-related disasters, such as identifying flood-prone areas and drawing up preparedness plans.

Moses Msuya, director of the disaster management department in the Prime Minister’s Office, said the program includes strategic actions, such as installing early warning systems, to boost Tanzania’s ability to respond to disasters and help people recover rapidly.

“Let us make good use of every opportunity to make our cities more resilient for people now and for our children’s future,” he said.

According to Msuya, many Tanzanian cities are at risk of flooding due to poor infrastructure, including a lack of storm drainage canals.

“Rapid urbanization is increasing our vulnerability to climate-related risks. Our cities have undergone massive spatial expansion with the majority of residents living in unplanned settlements,” he said.

The initiative will focus on three priority areas - to identify and reduce risks, and prepare emergency disaster plans, Msuya added.

According to the World Bank, the program will use scientific methods to evaluate risks, and install early warning and monitoring equipment to prepare vulnerable communities for emergencies.

“No disaster is entirely natural,” said Edward Anderson, a disaster risk management specialist with the World Bank. “Disaster itself is often a failure in development planning.”

TEACHING RESILIENCE

As part of its strategy, the government will develop a “Resilience Academy”, in which the concept of resilience will be taught at university level to help younger generations tackle natural disasters and other threats, officials said.

Osiligi Lossai, local ward official for the Tandale neighborhood of Dar es Salaam, said flood risks are more severe in crowded slum areas like his.

“My people have suffered a lot, and they keep incurring huge losses every single year,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

According to a recent World Bank report on greening Africa’s cities, protecting fast-degrading environments in growing cities like Dar es Salaam can make them more liveable, and help them cope with extreme weather.

“Restoring forest areas and rehabilitating river systems could alleviate urban flooding problems, and make cities more pleasant and productive places to live,” Bella Bird, the World Bank’s country director for Tanzania, told the urban program launch.","Fri, 02 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['plan', 'cities', 'bank', 'areas', 'seeks', 'program', 'risks', 'protect', 'salaam', 'flooding', 'tanzania', 'disaster', 'climate', 'world', 'urban', 'threats']",

Still, the ranks of China’s online shoppers grew nearly 13 percent last year to a considerable 467 million, according to official statistics, showing the already vast market is still growing.

Alibaba and its largest rival, a Chinese games-and-social-media conglomerate called Tencent Holdings, have seen their shares surge over the past year as they report strong profits that suggest Chinese consumers still have a desire to spend. Their rise mirrors the surge in shares in the biggest technology names in the United States, like Apple, Google and Facebook.

During a speech at the conference, Alibaba’s chief financial officer, Maggie Wu, said that the company expected revenue for the year that will end next March to grow between 45 percent and 49 percent. That is slightly down from the 56 percent growth the company registered in fiscal year 2017, which ended in March. Still, it nonetheless shows the company is expecting to keep growing at a fast pace in the coming year.

Although Alibaba is China’s largest e-commerce company, it does not directly sell the goods on its websites. Instead, it provides marketplaces where anyone from small village dwellers to big global brands can set up online shops and sell to Chinese customers. To reach those customers, Alibaba also offers online advertising space.

That space is looking increasingly valuable.

During her speech, Ms. Wu said the company got about 60 percent of its revenue from its Alimama advertising platform, which works as an auction site on which Alibaba’s many vendors can bid for advertising space on its sites. On that platform the price for ads has been rising as a result of market forces, Ms. Wu said.","Thu, 08 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/09/world/09Alibaba/09Alibaba-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=98b7861838ec20dabceea30629fd3c79083bf09c095e84059087c275c7a639f1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"['chinese', 'predicts', 'online', 'china', 'surge', 'advertising', 'company', 'chinas', 'wu', 'alibaba', 'alibabas', 'strength', 'speech', 'space', 'sales', 'sign', 'strong']",

24,24,FL-2017-000062-TWN,Why Fairness Matters in Reforming Flood and Health Insurance Programs - Knowledge@Wharton - Knowledge@Wharton,https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/importance-fairness-reforming-flood-health-insurance-programs/,"As Congress looks at restructuring two national insurance plans — the American Health Care Act of 2017, and the National Flood Insurance Program — legislators must address the issue of fairness. That is the view of Wharton professors Howard Kunreuther and Mark Pauly, who co-authored the book, Insurance and Behavioral Economics: Improving Decisions in the Most Misunderstood Industry.

In this opinion piece, they argue that considering the issue of fairness in designing these programs is not merely an exercise to aid the old and needy. Rather, it is also to make legislators think about what policies will make premiums less onerous to people with lower risk so they will not be discouraged about getting coverage.

The United States of America is at a critical moment as Congress is attempting to determine how two insurance programs should be structured to help Americans who need protection from physical and financial risk. Both the reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and the American Health Care Act of 2017 raise questions as to whether affected individuals would be treated more fairly under the new legislation than they currently are.

For us, fairness in the context of new legislation means consideration of the impact that a sudden increase in premiums or unexpected changes in the terms of coverage will have on the well-being of the affected individuals.

When the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was enacted in 1968, there was a concern that high premiums would significantly reduce property values and that this could become an unfair economic strain. For this reason, the NFIP specified that homeowners living in high-risk areas at the time the law was enacted would be charged a subsidized premium.

The same potential conflict regarding fairness applies to health insurance. Is it fair that those with pre-existing medical conditions or those who unexpectedly acquire high-risk conditions might have to pay much higher health insurance premiums than when they were less at risk? Yet this is what will happen if private insurers are allowed to charge risk-based premiums and politicians decide to provide limited subsidies to cushion those higher premiums. However, is it fair to impose high premiums on individuals with low risks to finance such subsidies? And is it fair to offer no reward to those who take steps to improve their health status and thus reduce their future health spending risk?

Elected representatives on both sides of the aisle continually espouse the principle of fairness across a wide range of issues, including trade, tax reform, and jobs. If they truly want to extend that allegiance to the principle of fairness, they might wish to consider offering some form of financial assistance to help working class families who become high risk for floods or to help them buy or continue coverage for health care. The choice of the right amount of support regarded as fair is ultimately a political issue where voters’ perspectives may differ.

There are efficient ways to address the fairness problem for both insurance programs that might gain bipartisan support. With respect to health insurance premiums, it is easy to justify assisting low income and older people who want to buy coverage. Empirical studies of Medicaid programs suggest that individuals care about other people’s health conditions. Many taxpayers are thus likely to support having the public sector cover part of the cost of health insurance for those whose health might be improved by having insurance.

“There are efficient ways to address the fairness problem for both insurance programs that might gain bipartisan support.”

In the case of flood insurance, those subject to water-related damage should receive information on the cost of insurance that reflects their flood risk. If this risk-based premium exceeds a proportion of their income or housing costs, they could be given an insurance voucher or tax credit so they could afford insurance. A new RAND study recommends that those whose total housing costs — including flood insurance premiums — exceed a certain percentage of their income be provided with financial assistance. This would ensure that taxpayers are not subsidizing high-income individuals.

It is important to encourage property owners in flood prone areas to invest in cost-effective, loss-reduction measures. Homeowners could be offered a long-term home improvement loan, tied to the property, to pay for cost-effective ways to mitigate future losses, such as elevating the house or moving utilities to a higher floor, so that the annual cost of the loan, paid all or in part by vouchers or tax credits, would be less than their savings from the reduced risk-based premium. This proposal is not only fair, but also encourages property owners to reduce future losses from inevitable disasters. It also avoids using taxpayer dollars to assist uninsured and unprotected victims from hurricanes and floods who will demand and may receive federal disaster relief.

In summary, the proposed flood and health insurance programs should be designed with reasonable premiums for high-risk individuals so they will want to purchase coverage that protects them against catastrophic financial losses. At the same time, one needs to be concerned about not discouraging low-risk individuals from purchasing insurance by imposing the subsidy burden on them alone through premiums much higher than their risk rather than on the general population through a broad-based tax. By considering the issue of fairness as an important criterion in designing these programs, we will have taken a major step in enabling high-risk individuals to have coverage while at the same time maintaining the basic principles of insurance.","Thu, 15 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/costs-in-the-health-care-1.jpg,"['flood', 'health', 'fairness', 'insurance', 'programs', 'individuals', 'coverage', 'risk', 'premiums', 'matters', 'fair', 'reforming']",

27,27,FL-2017-000062-TWN,Lessons From The Nashville Flood Of 2010 - Palisades Hudson Financial Group,https://www.palisadeshudson.com/2017/06/lessons-from-the-nashville-flood-of-2010/,"Singer David Allan Coe famously said that the perfect country song had to contain “Mama, or trains, or trucks, or prison, or gettin’ drunk.”

Songwriter Steve Goodman obligingly added a verse containing all five to “You Never Even Called Me By My Name,” a humorous take on the misery that some listeners expect in a country tune that Coe turned into a hit. Its popularity demonstrates that country fans have a sense of humor about the disasters that fill the lyrics of some of the genre’s most famous songs.

But the misery of the home of country music, Nashville, Tennessee, in 2010 was all too real.

Areas that routinely experience flooding are typically prepared for the monetary costs and rebuilding efforts required by rising waters, allowing residents and businesses to purchase proper insurance coverage before a flood. Yet in May 2010, heavy rain, combined with a leaking levee, caught Nashville’s residents off guard. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, only 4,100 National Flood Insurance Program policies were in force across the metro area at the time.

More than 13 inches of rain fell in Nashville over a two-day period. This was more than double the city’s previous rainfall record and caused the Cumberland River to overflow and spill into downtown. More than 20 people died, more than 50 Nashville schools were damaged and hundreds of homes were filled with floodwater; overall, the flood caused billions in property damage.

In addition to the human misery created by a disaster of this scale, Nashville’s status as a living museum to music history meant that the flood destroyed many irreplaceable cultural artifacts and instruments. The Nashville Symphony lost two concert grand pianos, along with components of its pipe organ. The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum had to close temporarily to deal with serious flooding in a mechanical area, though no exhibits were affected. And the Grand Ole Opry saw its famous stage covered in 2 feet of water.

What lessons can we take from the Nashville flood? Many can be found in the story of Soundcheck Nashville, a complex of rehearsal spaces, repair shops and — most important in this case —storage facilities.

As a “cartage” company, Soundcheck not only rents storage space for instruments and equipment, but also delivers gear to professional studio musicians when they arrive for a recording gig. It is a huge facility, about 160,000 square feet. This means that a lot of Nashville’s professional musicians stored their instruments in the same place. Unfortunately, in 2010, that place was under water.

At the time of the flood, roughly 1,000 musicians stored instruments and equipment at Soundcheck, which was submerged for six days before anyone could access the facility. Its location on the Cumberland River meant that the business sustained millions in damage. Brad Paisley lost most of his touring guitars and equipment because, ironically, he and his crew were rehearsing for “The H2O World Tour” (a name keyed off his single “Water,” recorded long before the flood). Stars also affected by the Soundcheck flood included Vince Gill, Keith Urban, Lorrie Morgan and many others. The flood destroyed instruments played by legends such as Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend and Johnny Cash.

Any musician or music lover can appreciate the financial and emotional impact of the destruction of such one-of-a-kind items. Insurance does nothing for the emotional loss, but it can mitigate the financial blow. Soundcheck clients were responsible for insuring their own equipment, and many of them did not.

Professional musicians should be aware that most homeowners insurance policies do not cover instruments used to make money, even with a rider to provide additional coverage for high-value items. In addition, homeowners coverage typically includes a valuation process in which appraisers — who may not have much experience with instruments — assess value at the time the instrument is damaged. And, crucially in this case, most homeowners policies do not cover flood damage at all.

While riders to a homeowners policy may be useful for amateur musicians or students, professional musicians will likely want to look at specialized musical instrument insurance. In determining whether to purchase an instrument policy, musicians should consider their financial ability to replace or restore an instrument in case of loss or damage. Typically, instruments valued at $5,000 or more are worth covering. A handful of companies offer such policies, many with specialized focuses by instrument type or use. Instrument insurers tend to understand the items they cover more intimately, allowing for a range of coverage options that musicians can tailor to their unique situations. Many musical instrument policies cover flood or water damage by default, but buyers should check. Cost of coverage varies widely depending on how rare the instrument is and how vulnerable it is to damage. (For instance, because of their size, double basses are much more damage-prone than violins.)

Policies that determine payout according to both agreed value and devaluation are ideal for most professional musicians, since these policies cover not only the repair or replacement costs of the instrument up to an originally agreed-upon amount but also cover any reduction in the instrument’s original value as the result of repair. Agreed value also leaves little room for dispute with the insurer, since the instrument’s payout value is determined upfront. Actual cash value (ACV) coverage is also common, but differs in that the insurance company determines the payout amount according to the instrument’s replacement cost and assumed condition immediately prior to the event causing damage or loss, typically resulting in a lower amount.

Musicians who own unique or historical instruments of high value especially may want to secure coverage based on agreed value. Although ACV may cost less, care is required when insuring high-value instruments based on it. The risk of disagreeing with the insurer over the instrument’s proper value rises greatly with one-of-a-kind items. Also, ACV policies often include limits on the total payout amount, regardless of the instrument’s true value.

When agreed-value coverage is unrealistic because of cost, the next best thing may be coverage based on stated value. Not to be confused with agreed value, stated value allows policyholders to insure items for less than they are actually worth in exchange for lower premiums. The Nashville flood serves as a warning that if you own any item that is truly irreplaceable, it is important to understand under what circumstances your existing insurance covers its loss.

The 2010 flood also serves as a reminder that it is important to diversify. Valuable assets and possessions face many of the same risks as stocks in an investment portfolio do. The devastation across Nashville in 2010, especially at Soundcheck, is a lesson in geographic risk — the risk of financial loss because of a market’s geographic location. Homeowners have one primary residence, so geographic risk is difficult to mitigate in case of a natural disaster without fortifying the home or moving. Businesses, however, should note the damage caused by Soundcheck’s decision to store all of its customers’ equipment in one physical space, increasing risk that a local weather event could essentially wipe out the business. Soon after the flood, in fact, Soundcheck opened a separate facility in Austin, Texas, and later another in Houston.

John Hobbs, a member of Gill’s band, told the Los Angeles Times that many musicians had banked on their vintage or collectible instruments to supplement their retirement savings. Unfortunately, tangible property is vulnerable to rain and river water, as well as to the whims of the market. A natural disaster can create very real consequences for keeping all one’s eggs in one basket — or storage facility.

The last lesson from the Nashville flood is the hugely important role that philanthropy continues to play in people’s lives. Communities that come together in the darkest moments to help those most in need deserve recognition. Paisley, Gill, Urban and many other musicians who lost instruments at Soundcheck or elsewhere donated them to NASH2O, a charitable endeavor organized after the flood. NASH2O auctioned off the damaged instruments as collectors’ items and donated the proceeds to recovery organizations, including one that focused on relief for uninsured musicians and industry professionals.

Nashville being Music City, several benefit concerts supported rebuilding efforts. Gill, Garth Brooks and even Kesha (who grew up in Nashville) all hosted benefits. Taylor Swift donated $500,000 outright, and many musicians loaned or donated their own instruments to others who had lost theirs. Not only celebrities pitched in. The mayor’s office estimated that 29,000 volunteers donated more than 375,000 service hours to clean up the city and rebuild damaged homes.

While helping others out of the goodness of one’s heart provides incalculable human benefits, those who contributed personal instruments and funds toward the rebuilding efforts likely also received financial benefits through the charitable income tax deduction. Though donated time is not deductible, expenses incurred while performing charitable work can be claimed on Schedule A of a taxpayer’s return. Such benefits are obviously not the motivating factor behind most people’s generosity, but they stretch resources.

During the years following the Nashville flood, Music City has regained its footing as the thriving hub for country music. Paisley may have summed up the experience best in telling the Los Angeles Times shortly after the flood, “I think the silver lining is that we’ve seen a side of Nashville you only see emerge in this kind of adversity, and it’s a fantastically graceful place. No one’s looking for a handout. No one’s even angry.” Much like the best country songs, even the darkest moments of the Nashville flood ended with a sense of hope.","Tue, 06 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.palisadeshudson.com/_/doc/2015/06/PHFG-favicon.png,"['flood', 'value', 'soundcheck', 'music', 'instrument', 'instruments', 'policies', 'musicians', 'nashville', '2010', 'coverage', 'lessons']",

The airport is mainly in use for Asian destinations, in China, Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia. Approaching planes were told to divert to Taichung or Kaohsiung if needed, reports said.

Flights resumed at 12:43 p.m., after a total of 137 flights had been canceled or diverted, the authorities said.

The airports on the islands of Kinmen and Matsu close to the coast of China’s province of Fujian were also closed.

The foul weather also had an impact on the country's busiest airport at Taoyuan, with 20 flights canceled and others rescheduled, having to wait on the tarmac, or being diverted to Kaohsiung, reports said.

Around 11 a.m., cleaning crews were told to head for Terminal Two, where souvenir and tax-free shops were threatened by flooding. The water was reportedly entering through a leak in the roof at the recently inaugurated airport Mass Rapid Transit station. The problem was put right by 11:50 a.m., reports said.

The airport also prepared anti-flooding equipment and more than 3,000 sandbags to prevent flooding of low-lying areas such as underground car parks.

Rail traffic in several directions was also affected by the rains during the morning, with flooded tracks recorded in Qidu near Keelung, which interrupted trains to and from the East Coast, and in Yingge, New Taipei City, where trains in both directions between North and Central Taiwan were forced to use the same track. By 1 p.m., rail traffic in both locations was possible again, though trains would reduce speed, the rail company said.","Fri, 02 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://tnimage.s3.hicloud.net.tw/photos/shares/593118a6cee80.jpg,"['closes', 'flights', 'coast', 'hours', 'rain', 'taiwan', 'torrential', 'water', 'airport', 'reports', 'traffic', 'taipei', 'songshan', 'trains', 'flooding']",

The Indian Navy (IN) is currently assisting the Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan governments in dealing with a devastating cyclone and flood, respectively. The IN has sent its personnel along with relief supplies to Sri Lanka. The situation is still developing with the arrival of the monsoon in southern and eastern India; it is possible that India may send more assistance to the concerned governments. India has rendered similar assistance in previous years, most notably in in April 2015, when Nepal was hit by a massive earthquake. Indian assistance teams were quick to reach interior parts of Nepal and help the citizens affected due to the earthquake.

In 2015, the Indian Air Force (IAF) was deployed in Yemen to bring back Indian and other nationals trapped in the war-torn country. During that relief effort, India rescued nationals from 41 countries apart from bringing home a large number of Indian citizens. Last July, India was quick to get its citizens out of South Sudan as well. In both these efforts, India’s deputy foreign minister himself was overlooking the rescue effort.

Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh were hit by natural disasters whereas the crises in Yemen and South Sudan are cases of civil war. The Indian response to both natural and manmade disasters has been evolving into a pattern where India is quick to respond. India has done so in the past as well, as seen during the 2011 evacuations from Libya and assistance provided in the wake of tsunami in 2004.

It’s important to note that all these crises have been in the region from the Red Sea to the Malacca Strait. The Indian mainland is not very far from these disaster zones. Hence, India could deploy its military assets more effectively than in other parts of the world. The Indian military is the strongest force in the region; its geographic advantage is coupled with material capabilities like naval warships and long range aircraft.

In the early 20th century, the British Raj dominated the region from Red Sea to Singapore, with control over sea routes and inland areas alike. The Royal Navy in particular was the most powerful force in the region. The British Raj in India had built up an expeditionary force and was politically as well as financially capable of deploying it. Post-independence India has not been able to continue to play the same role for a variety of reasons, but India’s economic and military capabilities have increased in the last three decades. Hence, India is now beginning to play an important role in the region, as could be seen in its humanitarian and disaster relief activities.

Indian policymakers have been purchasing long-range, heavy airlift aircraft like the C-17 Globemaster and C-130J Hercules in the last decade. The United States has been a chief source of supply for these heavy aircraft. India has purchased 10 C-17s and one will be added to the fleet in the coming year. India had bought six C-130s and is now left with four, two being lost to accidents. These aircraft have been used in the relief efforts mounted in the past.

In addition to these heavy aircraft, the Indian Navy has built up capabilities over the years to send relief supplies and personnel quickly in case of a disaster. The benefits are visible in the current situation in Sri Lanka. In case of the 2004 post-tsunami operations and Libyan rescue as well, it was the navy that played a major role. The IN has also been coordinating with other regional navies to patrol the waters off the coast of Somalia to prevent piracy.

The Indian Air Force and Indian Navy have been quite active in relief efforts abroad, like those in South Sudan and Yemen. However, in case of domestic emergencies, like the floods in the state of Kashmir, the Indian Army has been deployed. In fact, the army typically plays a major part in relief efforts at home. The Indian Army has also been participating in peacekeeping efforts with the UN since the 1960s.

India’s active participation in disaster relief operations has been noted across the world. During the Yemen operations, Indian assistance was sought not just by smaller south Asian neighbors but also by Europe and the United States. Such disaster relief operations serve two principal purposes for India. First, by responding to crises situations quickly, India is able to project its growing power. However, the display of such growing power is not done in an obnoxious manner. Rather, by taking a lead in rescue efforts and relief operations, India projects its image as a responsible power.

There have been voices within and outside India arguing that it should play the role of a net security provider in the Indian Ocean Region. As the strategic situation in IOR is changing due to uncertainty over U.S. policy under Donald Trump and an assertive China in Asia, it is time for a major regional power like India to become more active in the region. Whether India will gather sufficient political and financial resolve to play the role of net security provider or not will be decided in the coming years. But as of now, India’s growing and active role in disaster relief operations in the IOR points to the possibility and capability of India.

In cities across the country and in the capital of Beijing, a colorful bike-share revolution is taking over on the streets, helping ease traffic snarls and keeping the air cleaner. It is also creating some problems.

China used to be called the ?kingdom of bicycles,? and though cars have taken over in a major way, the growing popularity of bike-share apps seems to indicate two-wheelers are making a come back.

?Color revolution

For drab and dusty Beijing, the bike-share color revolution of yellows, oranges and blues is a welcome sight. People of all ages are enjoying the convenience the bikes provide, which combines cell phone technology, and GPS tracking in some cases, to help users find a ride.

Traveling by car across the sprawling, densely populated city is often a nightmare. Even distances of a few kilometers can take up to an hour when traffic is snarling.

Cheng Li, a bike-share user, said he has been driving his car less and using the metro more since he started using the service about six months ago.

?After I get off the metro, I usually have to walk another kilometer or two, so I?ll grab a bike share and go. It?s less stressful,? Cheng said.

For many, the convenience of cycling is its biggest attraction. Beijing?s city government has long had a bike-share program in place, but many of its bike-share stations were inconveniently located. Getting registered for the smart phone based apps is also much easier.

For Zhang Jian, the bike-share revolution is not only convenient, but nostalgic.

?Now, when we?re riding home from work, especially in the evening, when it?s not as rushed, it feels like we?re reliving the past,? Zhang said.

Impounded bicycles from the bike-sharing schemes M Impounded bicycles from the bike-sharing schemes Mobike and Ofo are seen in Shanghai, China. Impounded bicycles from the bike-sharing schemes Mobike and Ofo are seen in Shanghai, China.

?Great Wall of bikes

But with a growing number of providers, competition is getting increasingly fierce. One key tactic of providers has been to flood the streets with bikes ? so much so that sidewalks are almost blocked in some cases.

The surge of bikes has become a major headache for city governments. Users frequently leave bikes in the middle of the street or just dump them on the sidewalk blocking passageways in an already densely populated city.

In Beijing?s southern district of Daxing, authorities have been fighting the surge by seizing the illegally parked bikes that clog streets and metro exits, one transportation worker said.

?Bike sharing is really convenient, but no one is taking care of the problem of illegally parked bikes,? the worker said. Behind her are several thousand bikes that have been seized. It was unclear when or how they would be returned to the companies that made them.

?Since the Lunar New Year, the number of bikes has been growing rapidly. At least 10,000 bikes have been added to the streets (of Daxing) since then, and we?ve collected about a third of that total,? she said.

China?s two biggest operators, Ofo and Mobike, have deployed more than 3 million bikes in scores of cities across the country. And the numbers continue to grow.

Mobike aims to expand to 100 cities at home and abroad by the end of this year.

Bike hunters

While many complain the bike-share revolution has taken over city streets, some like Gao Xiaochao are taking matters into their own hands.

Gao is one of many who call themselves bike-share hunters. Bike-share hunters find and report stolen and vandalized bikes that users deliberately park outside their homes or inside gated communities. With some bike-share apps, riders can report illegally parked bikes or other problems the two-wheelers may have.

Gao uses his lunchtime to find, report and move illegally parked bikes.

?Bike hunting is like a game, a hobby, a way to get some exercise. It?s like a new way of living,? Gao said. ?Sometimes, I spend two to three hours looking for illegally parked bikes and it?s just like talking a walk.?

Many like Gao are passionate about bike sharing and what it is doing to help transportation and the city?s notoriously smoggy air.

However, as complaints grow and competition gets increasingly cut-throat, they hope companies will do more to improve their service and not just focus on flooding the streets with bikes to edge out competitors.","Sun, 11 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/79A3DA72-028F-4578-A5F9-29139A0A1599.jpg,"['brings', 'bikesharing', 'headaches', 'bicycles', 'illegally', 'convenience', 'revolution', 'ofo', 'bikeshare', 'parked', 'streets', 'mobike', 'bikes', 'china']",

While many Americans are familiar with dishes like egg foo young, there are Chinese-American and Chinese immigrant communities throughout the country where foods like ma po tofu and congee are also on menus.

And Panda Express, America's biggest Chinese fast-food chain, hopes to make those more traditional dishes mainstream. ""Panda Express ... has the opportunity to be the ambassador of Chinese food to many people,"" says Andrea Cherng, the company's chief marketing officer.

Chern's parents opened Panda Express in 1983, at a time when Chinese food was still seen as ""exotic."" It's now America's biggest Chinese fast-food chain, with more than 1,900 locations around the world.

But as Americans have become more curious, adventurous eaters, the challenge for the chain is to keep up with the changing food culture — while still seeming familiar enough not to alienate those many mall and airport diners who come to the chain for its Americanized spin on Chinese food.

""Our job at Panda Express is to follow that journey of how palates have grown,"" Cherng says.

A history of adaptation for American palates

Over the years, critics have often knocked Panda Express for serving up ""mediocre"" Chinese food that you wouldn't actually find on a menu in China. (Buzzfeed went so far as to create a video called ""Chinese People Try Panda Express for the First Time."") But the story of Chinese food in America has always been one of adaptation.

""It still takes time for many Americans to like Chinese food,"" says historian Haiming Liu, author of ""From Canton Restaurant to Panda Express: A History of Chinese Food in the United States. ""It's a historical problem for Chinese food, and Chinese restaurants have to do something about it.""

As Liu explains, Chinese food didn't start to become popular in the U.S. until the 20th century. Before that, hundreds of thousands of Chinese laborers who landed on the West Coast in the mid 19th century — to help build railroads, farm and mine — were met with deep racism.

Many non-Chinese were suspicious of the newcomers and saw them as competition for jobs. Those racist, nativist attitudes extended to cuisine: Prejudiced Americans complained of the stench of Chinatown's kitchens, and editorials asked whether ""Chinese eat rats?""

Liu says anti-Chinese fervor on the West Coast prompted some Chinese to head East. And that's why, ""in the 1900s, Chinese restaurants started to grow really fast in places like New York City,"" says Liu. (As The Salt has reported, a loophole in immigration law also played a big role in the Chinese restaurant boom of the 1910s.)

In New York, Chinese immigrants found diners that were more open-minded — as long as the recipes were adapted for American palates, Liu says.

Americans didn't care for the strong, pungent flavors of ingredients that might have been used in traditional Chinese cooking such as bitter melon, black mushrooms or mustard greens. So chefs adapted.

""In American-style Chinese food, the vegetables used tend to be crunchy but flavorless – broccoli, carrots, celery, bean sprouts,"" says Jennifer 8. Lee, whose documentary, The Search for General Tso, traces the roots and myths of the popular American Chinese chicken dish. ""Chop suey, for example, is based on a familiar dish, but it's not something you see Chinese people eat. It became this food that completely catered to Western tastes.""

American-Chinese cuisine got an additional profile boost in the 1960s, when the U.S. overhauled immigration laws that had previously kept may Asians out. A flood of new immigrants were able to come from different regions of China, like the Sichuan and Hunan provinces, and they brought their regional cuisines with them, Liu says.

Those newcomers also tended to be more affluent than their predecessors, and that made an impression on non-Chinese Americans, says Liu. ""Americans realized that Chinese people can be rich and wealthy,"" he says, ""and their food could be good, accordingly."" (Indeed, the way immigrant cuisines are valued in America has often reflected the way those immigrants themselves are seen.) But those immigrants who opened restaurants still adapted and softened their dishes so they would be welcomed by their new country.

That's a tradition that Panda Express — which was born in California's San Gabriel Valley, home to a large Chinese-American population — followed as it expanded throughout America.

Searching for the next orange chicken hit

""There is this bridge that we are making from our Chinese heritage to a wider American audience,"" says Cherng. ""How do we introduce the flavors that we experience around the San Gabriel Valley to the mainstream?""

Take the chain's single most popular dish, orange chicken. It makes up a third of its sales, but it's not a traditional Chinese recipe: Developed in the 1980s, the dish actually sprung from a blend of cuisines that Panda Express' then-head chef had tasted, both in China's Sichuan province and in Hawaii.

Though orange chicken is often derided as ""inauthentic,"" Cherng believes the dish honors the food of her family because it evolved to suit its surroundings, just as her own immigrant parents did when they first moved to America in the mid-1960s.

So she and her team have been looking to the cuisine her friends and family grew up on to discover the next orange chicken-like hit.

Helping her on that quest is Jimmy Wang, who works as Panda Express' ""innovation chef. He's developing recipes that are familiar enough to Americans, but also familiar to Chinese people trying an Americanized version of a classic dish.

""We want to make sure that whatever we change isn't a sacrifice, but an enhancement,"" he says. ""We don't want to be so focused on the history of it that we forget that we need to make a delicious dish at the end of the day.""

For example, in developing Panda Express' recipe for Pacific Chili Shrimp, Wang needed to find an alternative for the fermented, nutty flavor of Chinese black vinegar that's traditionally used. ""A lot of times, customers would say that it tasted weird,"" he says.

So he swapped in distilled, white vinegar. And instead of adding heat from the fermented chili paste, he used crushed chilis. ""It's warm and less abrasive,"" says Wang, ""and it's something that customers have had before.""

Changing those ingredients may get the dish away from its origins, but it's a modification that makes it accessible to more diners, says Wang. ""If there's history tied to something that we know of, then that's good start,"" Wang says.

One traditional dish that the chain altered and is now trying out in certain Southern California outlets: cōng yóu bing, also known as a scallion pancake. Less traditional is how Cherng envisions diners eating it — like a wrap or a burrito, stuffed with orange chicken or other entrees.

Cherng and chef Wang are testing out lots of other recipes, too, like a beef brisket stew inspired by hóng shāo niú ròu, a dish of braised beef that Wang's mother and grandmother used to make for him when he was growing up in Taiwan.

""The best that American Chinese food can bring to bear is taking parts of the past – the flavors that we know – and bringing it forward in original ways,"" says Cherng.","Fri, 09 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/06/08/160224-full_wide-f6c71493e3a5ae7614f59f0bb80ab40744634ae1.jpg?s=1400,"['fare', 'express', 'chinese', 'traditional', 'dish', 'wang', 'cherng', 'try', 'liu', 'food', 'panda', 'americans']",

BEIJING - 17 June 2017: Standing in a dimly-lit gallery space in China's National Museum, the owner of the world's only privately-held Vermeer gazed at the small oil painting for a long moment, before showing it to the assembled press.



Since American billionaire Tom Kaplan purchased the piece in 2008, it has spent most of its time on loan to various museums around the world.



When the investor -- who made his fortune betting on precious metals and natural gas -- and his wife began buying up works by 17th century Dutch painters in 2003, their goal was to take ""paintings from the private domain and return them to the public"", he said.



Now the collection is set to find its biggest audience yet when a selection of around 70 of its more than 250 works goes on show from Saturday through September 3 just steps from the mausoleum of Communist China's founder Mao Zedong on Tiananmen Square.



China is the first stop on a world tour of the works, known as the Leiden Collection after the Dutch town where many of its contributors plied their trade during the European nation's golden age.



After three months in Beijing, the exhibition will move to a private museum in Shanghai before heading to Russia and then the United Arab Emirates.



The National Museum, according to officials, has passed the Louvre to become the world's most visited, and if all goes according to plan, the exhibition will see hundreds of thousands of visitors flood through its doors.



While the Vermeer is a showstopper, the exhibit is built around the Kaplans' collection of 11 Rembrandts and focuses on the artist's evolution and influence on his contemporaries.



It is a major step towards achieving the couple's goal of promoting the Dutch master's legacy to an international audience, an effort which Kaplan believes will be greatly boosted by a positive reception in China.



""The cultural influence of China is going to multiply in the next decade,"" he said, adding that the painter's future will ""be very different depending on the way China reacts to his art"".



""The country will hopefully embrace Rembrandt for the genius he is.""



Kaplan expresses a fervent belief in the transformative power of art, promoting his favourite painter with an almost missionary zeal.



The investor discovered the artist during a visit to the New York Museum of Metropolitan Art when he was six years old, sparking a life-long obsession with the Dutch master.



He and his wife began collecting Rembrandts after a chance encounter in 2003 with a renowned art expert, who informed him that many of the paintings remained in private hands and were available for purchase.



The couple soon began snatching up works from the era, buying ""on average a painting a week for five years,"" Kaplan said.



He believes Rembrandt's power lies in his universality and the revolutionary message hidden in his work: ""Beauty is truth. It's humanity. That's our salvation.""



Rembrandt lived in an era when the Netherlands was a global trading powerhouse in the 17th century, something that should resonate with many Chinese visitors to the exhibition, who are grappling with their own country's sudden access to wealth.



""We believe very strongly that perhaps uniquely Rembrandt can serve as (a) bridge,"" he said.



""(Rembrandt) is truly a universal artist from whose DNA we've seen art all over the world be able to find its freedom and liberation.""



As attendees leave the exhibition, they will be confronted by a wall of paintings captioned with an admonition to ""Beware of Riches.""



It is a timely, if perhaps unintentional, warning for a country that is grappling with rampant corruption, as well as a spiritual malaise linked to what many see as increasingly pervasive materialism.



While the exhibition is expected to receive a warm welcome in China, the underlying message might find a less eager audience.



The concept of ""universal values"" is not a popular one in modern China, where the government of President Xi Jinping has demonstrated an almost reflexive distaste for the kinds of ""Western"" ideals Kaplan embraces.



But the billionaire has no interest in lecturing. Rembrandt, he said, speaks for himself.","Sat, 17 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/larg/8214.jpg,"['brings', 'kaplan', 'painters', 'collection', 'rembrandts', 'billionaire', 'chinas', 'exhibition', 'museum', 'works', 'art', 'dutch', 'masses', 'rembrandt', 'china']", 
35,35,FL-2017-000062-TWN,China bans more synthetic opioids blamed for US drug deaths - STAT,https://www.statnews.com/2017/06/19/synthetic-opioids-fentanyl-china/,"Deng Ming, deputy director of China's National Narcotics Control Commission, announced that four synthetic opioids would be added to China's list of controlled substances as of July 1.

BEIJING — China said Monday it would ban a designer drug called U-47700 and three others, following U.S. pressure to do more to control synthetic opioids blamed for fast-rising overdose deaths in the United States.

In China, U-47700 has until now been a legal alternative to fentanyl and potent derivatives like carfentanil. Its usage has been growing among U.S. opioid addicts.

Last year, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration listed U-47700 in the category of the most dangerous drugs it regulates, saying it was associated with dozens of fatalities, mostly in New York and North Carolina. Some of the pills taken from Prince’s estate after the musician’s overdose death last year contained U-47700.

The DEA has long said that China is the top source country for synthetic opioids like fentanyl and its precursors, assertions Beijing has said lack firm evidence. Still, the two countries have deepened cooperation as the U.S. opioid epidemic intensifies.

Deng Ming, deputy director of the National Narcotics Control Commission, said that U-47700 and three other synthetic drugs — MT-45, PMMA, and 4,4′-DMAR — would be added to China’s list of controlled substances as of July 1.

Yu Haibin, a division director at the Ministry of Public Security’s Narcotics Control Bureau, said China was making “big efforts” to deal with drugs known as new psychoactive substances. These substances are made by modifying the chemical structures of controlled substances in order to get around the law, and China has now restricted 138 of them.

However, as soon as one substance is banned, chemists create slightly different and technically legal alternatives and then market them online.

“My feeling is that it’s just like a race and I will never catch up with the criminals,” Yu told a news conference. “Actually, we just want to make a breakthrough in dealing with this.”

To counter the cat-and-mouse game, Yu said authorities had set up a system whereby information on new types of drugs gleaned during police investigations, customs clearances and medical treatment would be transferred to the national drug lab. An expert committee would then assess this information and send alert notices to relevant agencies in order to help speed up the control of new substances, he said.

Yu said suspects use the internet to communicate with customers and use the anonymized digital currency bitcoin to transfer money, and that authorities were working with internet companies to try to stop such trade and the advertising of drugs on websites.

To combat drugs being sent by post or express delivery service, authorities were carrying out real-name registration requirements and X-rays of parcels being delivered to “high-risk areas,” he said.

Addressing the news conference, Justin Schoeman, Beijing-based country attache for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, said: “I can tell you that when China controls a substance, (new psychoactive substances) or fentanyl-classed substance, it has a huge impact on seizures and availability in the U.S., so thank you very much.

“The controlling of substances in China certainly saves lives in the U.S.,” he added.

He added that China’s banning of additional substances means the U.S. and China can now carry out joint investigations on those chemicals, including the tracking of packages from the source through to the recipients in the U.S.

U-47700 is a synthetic opioid, a fast-proliferating class of drugs that have caused thousands of deaths in the United States. In 2015 alone, there were 9,580 deaths due to synthetic opioids other than methadone, accounting for almost a fifth of all drug overdose deaths.

BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China's Caihong (CH), or Rainbow, solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the country's first near-space solar drone, has successfully conducted a flight at an altitude of 20 km.

The project team under China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation announced Tuesday that the CH UAV, flew smoothly in near space for over 15 hours under control, finishing its scheduled path before landing securely.

FLY HIGHP The near space region, which lies 20 to 100 km above sea level, contains thin air that reduces the performance of traditional fuel-powered aircraft engines.

However, solar drones like the CH UAV can perform well in this area and it is expected that such aircraft may be able to fly continuously for months or even longer in the future, said Li Guangjia, director of the project.

The CH UAV, with a wingspan of 45 meters equipped with solar panels, boasts a high cost efficiency as it does not require refuelling during long-term missions, said Shi Wen, chief engineer of the project.

Also, the solar-powered feature allows the UAV to generate no air pollution, making it environmentally-friendly, Shi said.

With the success of the CH UAV flight, China has become the third country to master near-space solar drone technology following the United States and the United Kingdom.

The United States has developed solar drones such as the ""Helios"" and the United Kingdom sent its UAV ""Zephyr"" to an altitude of over 15 km in 2007.

The CH UAV team said the project has overcome challenges in some key technological fields, such as aerodynamics, flight control and efficient use of energy, during its development.

It has taken over one year to solve the issue of precise control in complicated weather conditions to ensure more reliable flight.

""With the development of the CH UAV, new technologies and products such as graphene-related materials, advanced solar cells and innovative energy storage methods will also be developed and these will further promote China's aviation industry,"" Shi said.

GREAT EXPECTATIONS

According to the project plan, the CH UAV will perform as a ""quasi-satellite"" in the future, being able to supplant some functions of telecommunication satellites in providing data relay services.

It is also expected to be used as ""an airborne mobile Wi-Fi hub"" to provide convenient mobile telecommunication and Internet access for remote areas and islands, saving the huge construction and maintenance costs of traditional communication means.

According to Shi, the UAV will also be capable of forestry and agricultural surveying as well as early warning and real-time monitoring of disasters.

""In earthquake, flood or forest fire situations where telecommunications are cut off, such vehicles may provide services to maintain communication with the affected areas,"" Shi said.","Tue, 13 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['reaches', 'solar', 'ch', 'fly', 'near', 'nearspace', 'rainbow', 'uav', 'united', 'flight', 'project', 'space', 'solarpowered', 'xinhua', 'focus', 'drone', 'high', 'shi']",

39,39,FL-2017-000062-TWN,Rain in Meghalaya is flooding Bangladesh’s wetlands. India must help its neighbour fix this - Scroll.in,https://scroll.in/article/839763/rain-in-meghalaya-is-flooding-bangladeshs-wetlands-india-must-help-its-neighbour-fix-this,"“We were in a festive mood just after the celebrations for the Bengali new year. All preparations were made to harvest our crops but the sudden heavy rainfall and flash flood destroyed everything,” said Shafikul Islam, a farmer from Tahirpur Sadar in Sunamganj district of North-eastern Bangladesh. “The flood from Meghalaya [in India] submerged our farmlands, breaking the embankments. We lost everything.”

Islam’s lament is depressingly familiar in the bowl-shaped wetlands – called haors – in North-eastern Bangladesh, where thousands of farmers like him lose their crops to severe flooding whenever it rains heavily in the southern reaches of Meghalaya. Known as the wettest region of India, Meghalaya (“abode of clouds” in Sanskrit) receives, on average, 120 cm of rainfall per year. Whenever it rains there, people living around the haors in Bangladesh are apprehensive.

But this year’s flash flood was different, said Istiak Sobhan, environmental specialist at the World Bank in Bangladesh. Usually the region experiences flash floods in mid-May, when farmers have already harvested their spring crops, he told thethirdpole.net, but this year the region was submerged by a sudden flash flood in April, destroying the harvest.

The flash flood caused the water to surge over the embankment, which inundated acre after acre of standing crop in the Dhaki Union of Kishorganj district, Bangladesh. Photo credit: Imtiaz Ahmad]

The valleys of Meghalaya on the North of the ridge bordering Bangladesh do not escape unscathed from the rains. The incessant rains that flooded the haors at the end of April also led to a flash flood in Meghalaya’s South-West Garo Hills district, submerging houses and agricultural land, and causing damage to roads and fish ponds, according to local media reports. In East Garo Hills, residents reported that the Simsang river was flowing close to the danger mark, according to the Assam Tribune. Other rivers were also in spate, the newspaper reported.

Crops destroyed

Although the damage in Meghalaya was not very high, the loss to haor farmers in Bangladesh has been extensive. In Netrokona district alone, around 73,070 hectares of paddy fields were submerged, according to the Dhaka Tribune. “This paddy would have produced at least 281,320 tonnes of rice, the current market value of which is nearly Bangladeshi Taka 956.49 crore ($ 1.2 million),” Bilash Chandra Pal, the Netrokona district agricultural officer, told the newspaper.

The early flash flood also destroyed the spring Boro rice crop in more than 200,000 hectares of haor land in the Sunamganj, Sylhet, Moulvibazar, Netrokona and Kishoreganj districts.

Boro is the major paddy crop in Bangladesh, accounting for 19 of 34 million tonnes of annual production in the country, according to the Department of Agriculture Extension. The damage to two million tonnes of rice will cause the country to suffer for the rest of the year, and its impact has already been noticed following a hike in the prices of staple foods in the market, said agricultural economist Quazi Shahabuddin.

The Bangladesh government is planning to buy 600,000 tons of rice from international markets, including India and Thailand. “We have already sought international tender to procure 100,000 tons of rice, even though we have not procured rice from international market for the last six years,” said Mohammad Badrul Hasan, director general of Bangladesh’s Department of Food.

Rotting rice

In addition to the loss of a good harvest, farmers and fishermen in the affected region complained of fish dying due to water contamination. At least 300,000 farmers were severely affected, which also created an acute shortage of fodder, forcing distress sales of farm animals.

Duck farming is one of the major sources of livelihood in the haor region, but birds are dying due to the toxic gases and polluted water from rotten rice. People are leaving their homes and are forecasting a severe crisis of food and lack of livelihood in the area. The government has already banned fishing in a number of haors, which is a wetland ecosystem recognised by the Ramsar Convention.

Aziz Mia, a duck farmer who lives in Bishwambarpur, told thethirdpole.net that he had never seen such a flood in his life. He lost all 150 of his ducks and is now thinking of migrating to Sylhet city (Jalalabad) to look for work.

Towards the end of March, the rainfall in Sylhet, which is south of Meghalaya and across the border, was four times more than in the same days last year, according to the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. Rainfall was above normal from March 1 to May 10 this year in the North-east region of India, according to India Meteorological Department.

Role of climate change

Although the role of climate change in flash floods such as these is yet to be firmly established, pre-monsoon rainfall and its intensity may increase in the future, according to a recent study by the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology.

There is a need to prepare for the erratic monsoon rainfall, said AKM Saiful Islam, professor at the university’s Institute of Water and Flood Management and lead author of the study. But the annual damage to the haor region cannot be tackled by Bangladesh alone.

Syeda Rizwana Hassan, chief executive of the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers’ Association, said at a recent media briefing that given the warm relations between the two countries, both governments should exchange information on potential floods.

[Photo/China Daily]

Crackdown on pollution puts sparkle back into Pujiang's local economy

Zhou Chengle, 62, relaxes outside his whitewashed three-story home in Jinhua, East China's Zhejiang province, and watches the local children paddling in the shallows of a sun-drenched Cuihu Lake.

Just four years ago, if he had seen someone swimming in the lake, the local landlord probably would have called for an ambulance.

""Before 2013, Cuihu Lake had all kinds of waste floating on the surface. Bad smells used to come up from the lake,"" he recalled.

The lake then was a sickly shade of milky-white, poisoned by tons of untreated waste dumped into it by 1,400 crystal glass workshops huddled around its banks.

Cuihu's transformation from cesspit to picturesque bathing spot was the result of a huge anti-pollution campaign launched by Zhejiang province in 2013, an initiative that has had far-reaching effects on not only the region's waterways but its economy and society.

Black crystal

Cuihu and its surrounding area, Pujiang county, was the first place targeted by Zhejiang's ""Water Movement"" launched in June 2013.

In Pujiang, 22,000 local companies churned out 85 percent of the world's hot fix crystal glassware.

The crystal industry had brought huge wealth to the county, with Pujiang's urban residents' per capita annual disposable income trebling from 9,542 yuan ($1,392) in 2003 to 30,711 yuan a decade later. Zhou had benefitted from the industry himself, renting out his downstairs flat to be used as a crystal workshop.

But cutthroat competition and lax regulation in the industry had also unleashed devastating pollution. By 2013, Pujiang was the most polluted county in China, according to China Global Television Network. More than 500 of its water sources were milk-white like Cuihu, while another 25 had turned black.

The county government had attempted to crack down on polluters in 2006 and 2011, but quickly aborted both campaigns for fear of damaging the industry, which then accounted for over 11 percent of the county's GDP and provided employment to more than 200,000 people.

With fear spreading that Pujiang's toxic waterways could create a public health emergency in the county and downstream Hangzhou, home to 9 million people, Zhejiang decided to take radical action to clean up China's ""crystal capital"".

Cleaning up

Policymakers in Zhejiang faced a seemingly intractable dilemma as the Water Movement got underway: How could they fix Pujiang's environmental problems without triggering an economic slump in the county?

It was eventually decided that they could only square this circle by dramatically consolidating the entire crystal industry, shutting down Pujiang's thousands of outdated, difficult-to-regulate workshops and promoting modern, large-scale production.

""The transformation and upgrading of the industrial structure is essential to solving the water problem,"" said Huang Hai, deputy director of Pujiang's environmental protection bureau.

The government launched a huge campaign to shut down workshops operating without a business license, enlisting every government department and the public to root out any violators. Often, they inspected workshops at midnight to catch clandestine polluters red-handed.

But, crucially, the government also invested 5.5 billion yuan to build the Pujiang Crystal Business Park, which opened in August 2015.

The region's remaining crystal companies were given the choice of moving to the new park or investing in their own sewage treatment systems, according to Huang.

More than 21,000 of Pujiang's crystal companies shut down as a result of these measures. Of the 614 producers that survived the crackdown, 526 are now based in the park.

Benefits abound

The Crystal Park has helped Pujiang's crystal industry remain competitive. Its centralized waste treatment system allows companies to share the costs, while the generous subsidies it provides help boost tenants' profits further.

Automating production also plays a key role in cost-cutting. ""I used to employ 100 workers before moving to the Crystal Park, but now I only need ten,"" says Luo Yintian, owner of Luoxiao Crystal.

Pujiang's crystal industry has not only survived the anti-pollution campaign but grown significantly. Its output value in 2016 was more than 9 billion yuan, up from 6 billion yuan in 2013.

This wealth is also trickling down to the wider economy. Per capita disposable income rose another 20 percent in Pujiang between 2013 and 2016, according to Zhejiang Online.

Workers who lost their jobs have either moved back to their home provinces or been paid compensation, according to the county government, with many using the money to set up agribusinesses growing grapes and Chinese toon.

Pujiang's cleaner environment is also helping new businesses sprout up. Xinguang village, which once choked on the fumes of 300 crystal workshops, is now a tourist spot housing trendy bars, cafes and boutiques.

In Cuihu, Zhou has also prospered from the water campaign. His new tenants have converted the old workshop into a restaurant, and pay him 5,000 yuan more a year in rent. He's now retired and spends his evenings strolling around the lake with his granddaughter.

""There are many people walking beside the lake in the evenings these days,"" he said with a smile.

Qin Jirong and Feng Chonglin contributed to the story.

Related story: Initiative that transformed Zhejiang

Zhejiang initiated the Water Movement campaign at the end of 2013.

It aims to tackle five issues: water pollution, flood control, drainage in waterlogged areas, water supply and water conservation.

Zhejiang has invested nearly $41 billion in projects related to the water campaign over the past three years: $12.3 billion in 2014, $16 billion in 2015, and $12.5 billion in 2016.

The province has appointed 60,000 ""river chiefs"", usually local government officials, who are responsible for the water quality in their local area.

By 2015, Zhejiang had cleaned up 6,500 kilometers of ""garbage"" rivers and 5,100 kilometers of ""black and smelly"" waterways.

And $5.5 billion has been invested in 177 major flood control projects over the last three years.

It strictly controls water usage, with the goal being that annual water consumption would not rise above 24.5 billion cubic meters in 2020.

By 2020, all water problems in Zhejiang are expected to be solved.","Mon, 12 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/img/attachement/jpg/site1/20170612/b083fe955aa11aa813ae0f.jpg,"['yuan', 'park', 'local', 'zhejiang', 'county', 'crystal', 'green', 'pujiangs', 'industrial', 'billion', 'water', 'industry', 'lake', 'turns', 'capital']", 
41,41,FL-2017-000062-TWN,New Bike Share Apps in China Create Bike 'Revolution' - Learning English (VOA),https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/new-bike-share-apps-n-china-create-bike-revolution/3894394.html,"New Chinese computer apps that let people share bicycles are easing traffic and reducing pollution, but they are also creating problems.

China used to be called the ""kingdom of bicycles,"" but since then, cars have taken over the country. Now, new apps that help people register and find bikes are being used more and more across cities like Beijing.

Easy and nostalgic

The apps combine cell phone technology and GPS tracking to help users find a ride.

Because of traffic jams, it can be difficult to travel across major Chinese cities. Even going a few kilometers can take up to an hour.

Cheng Li started using bike share services about six months ago. He said now he is using a car less and the metro more.

""After I get off the metro, I usually have to walk another kilometer or two, so I'll grab a bike share and go. It is less stressful.""

For many, the best part about cycling is how easy it is to do. Beijing has had a government-run bike share program for a long time. However, many of its bike share stations were not placed in convenient places. Now, it is easy to find a bike, and to register for the program with a smartphone.

For Zhang Jian, the bike share revolution is nostalgic.

""Now, when we're riding home from work, especially in the evening, when it's not as rushed, it feels like we're reliving the past,"" Zhang said.

Flooding the streets with bikes

However, there is now a lot of competition among bike share providers because of their popularity. Some providers are trying to flood the streets with bikes to be more visible. Sometimes there are so many bikes that they completely block the sidewalks.

This has become a problem for city governments. It is not uncommon for bike users to leave bikes in the middle of the street or on the sidewalk. This blocks cars and people in already crowded cities.

In Beijing's southern district of Daxing, officials have been trying to fix the problem by seizing illegally parked bikes.

VOA spoke to a woman who said, ""Bike sharing is really convenient, but no one is taking care of the problem of illegally parked bikes."" Behind her were several thousand seized bikes.

She added, ""Since the Lunar New Year, the number of bikes has been growing rapidly. At least 10,000 bikes have been added to the streets (of Daxing) since then and we've collected about a third of that total.""

China's two biggest bike share operators are Ofo and Mobike. At present, they have already deployed more than three million bikes in cities across China. And the numbers continue to grow.

Mobike aims to expand to 100 cities in China and around the world by the end of this year.

Bike hunters

Some people are trying to fix the problem of illegally parked bikes themselves.

Gao Xiaochao calls himself a ‘bike share hunter.’ He is a regular citizen who finds and reports stolen and damaged bikes that users park illegally. With some bike share apps, riders can report illegally parked bikes or problems with the bicycles they have.

Gao says he uses his lunchtime to find, report and move illegally parked bikes.

""Bike hunting is like a game, a hobby, a way to get some exercise. It's like a new way of living,"" Gao said. ""Sometimes, I spend two to three hours looking for illegally parked bikes and it's just like talking a walk.""

Many people in China feel that bike shares are helping the county’s transportation problems and polluted air. However, they also hope companies will do more to improve their service and avoid flooding the streets with bikes.

BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua Dictionary, the reference book with the largest circulation in the world, launched its first mobile app for readers and Chinese learners.

In April 2016, Guinness World Records recognized the Xinhua Dictionary, published by China's Commercial Press, as the ""most popular dictionary"" and the ""best-selling regularly updated book.""

The app will provide various search methods, including handwriting input, photo scanning and voice input.

Not only does the app include all of the content in the dictionary's paper edition, but it will also provide value-added services such as quizzes and Chinese character games.

The dictionary's first edition came out in 1953, and as of July 2015 the dictionary had sold 567 million copies globally.

It was the first dictionary written in simplified Chinese, as opposed to the traditional Chinese widely used before the May Fourth Movement in 1919. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, 11 editions of the dictionary have been published.

Dubbed the ""National Dictionary,"" Xinhua Dictionary has been a tool for several generations of Chinese people, bearing the culture of a great country and influencing billions. It is also a tool for foreigners who are learning about Chinese language and culture.","Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['mobile', 'chinese', 'dictionarys', 'dictionary', 'tool', 'culture', 'edition', 'launches', 'app', 'bestselling', 'provide', 'xinhua', 'world']",

A Chinese People’s Liberation Army-Navy (PLAN) task group arrived in Karachi, Pakistan, on Saturday for a four-day port call and training visit. The task group comprised three warships, including the Type 052C destroyer Changchun, Type 054A frigate Jingzhou, and Type 903A replenishment ship Chaohu.

According to China’s Xinhua news agency, the Chinese task group is led by Rear Admiral Shen Hao, deputy commander of the PLAN’s East Sea Fleet. According to Xinhua, Shen said “the visit will further promote the understanding and mutual trust between the two peoples, and boost the cooperation and friendship between the two countries.”

He reportedly added that increased “cooperation and communication” between the two navies would contribute to “regional stability and world peace and play an active role in promoting common development.” Pakistan and China consider each other “all-weather” strategic partners.

Admiral Mohammad Zakaullah, the Pakistan Navy’s chief of naval staff, visited the Chinese task group. According to a statement released by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Public Relations, Zakaullah said that the Pakistan-China friendship “is highly valued and the continued cooperation between them has proven to be a source of strength for both the countries.”

The Pakistani statement noted that the visit would cover professional discussions between the two navies, focused on increasing interoperability and maritime collaboration. “Operational training activities, joint interactive sessions, table top discussions on professional topics and social events are also planned,” the statement added. The two navies will also conduct passing exercises to expand their interoperability.

In addition to military-to-military cooperation, the two countries are jointly development military equipment, including the JF-17 Thunder multi-role fighter, and engaged in other defense commercial activity. Pakistan will also purchase eight Type 039A attack submarines from China.

A recently released U.S. Department of Defense report on Chinese military power suggested that the People’s Liberation Army-Navy’s next overseas base could be established in Pakistan. The PLAN’s first overseas base is currently under construction in Djibouti to facilitate anti-piracy deployments in the western Indian Ocean region.

As part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a Chinese state-owned firm took control of the strategically vital Gwadar port in late-2015. Though the port is currently a commercial project, as a warm-water, deep-sea port on the Arabian Sea, Gwadar could possess immense dual-use value as a naval logistics hub for the PLAN in the future.","Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat.com-19143811_1546948158669118_997533463463081541_o.jpg,"['chinese', 'navy', 'pakistan', 'training', 'visit', 'group', 'visits', 'interoperability', 'increasing', 'task', 'cooperation', 'statement', 'focus', 'type', 'port']",

BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Boosted by strong online sales, China's retail sales grew 10.7 percent year on year in May, signalling continued strength in consumption, official data showed Wednesday.

Total retail sales of consumer goods hit 2.95 trillion yuan (about 434.2 billion U.S. dollars) last month, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

The 10.7 percent growth pace was on par with that in April and 0.7 percentage points faster on a year-on-year basis.

In first five months, total retail sales of consumer goods rose 10.3 percent year on year, 0.1 percentage points faster than the growth in the first four months.

Online shopping saw robust growth, with total online retail sales hitting 2.47 trillion yuan in the first five months, up 32.5 percent year on year.

Physical goods sold online surged 26.5 percent year on year in the January-May period, accounting for 13.2 percent of total retail sales.

Consumption was relatively stronger in rural areas, with retail sales expanding 12.7 percent in May, outpacing urban areas, where retail sales climbed 10.4 percent year on year.

China is trying to shift its economy toward a growth model driven by consumer spending, innovation and services, while weaning it off over-reliance on exports and investment.

On Wednesday, NBS data also showed that China's fixed-asset investment grew 8.6 percent year on year in the first five months this year, while value-added industrial output expanded 6.5 percent year on year in May.","Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['retail', 'online', 'yuan', 'total', 'chinas', 'months', 'consumer', 'goods', '107', 'growth', 'pct', 'xinhua', 'sales']", 
52,52,FL-2017-000062-TWN,Donald Trump has tweeted climate change skepticism 115 times. Here's all of it. - Vox.com,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/1/15726472/trump-tweets-global-warming-paris-climate-agreement,"Long before he even declared his run for the White House, Donald Trump has been issuing periodic statements affirming his belief that man-made global warming is a myth, meant to stifle US manufacturing. While as recently as 2009 he was cosigning letters with other business leaders calling for “meaningful and effective measures to control climate change,” since about 2011 he has been tweeting his climate denialism regularly, a denialism that culminated in his exiting the Paris climate agreement on Thursday.

Most of his tweets involve some kind of confusion between climate and weather (“hey, it’s cold outside, global warming must be fake”) or condemnation of President Obama for making climate change a priority, which Trump interpreted as foolish. While the vast majority of the tweets predate Trump’s campaign, a couple were issued during the 2016 Republican primary, where this kind of climate change denial was common among candidates.

Here’s every Trump tweet I could find on the topic, from 2011 onward (concluding in October 2015).

Panda Express says: Give us a try - 89.3 KPCC,https://www.scpr.org/news/2017/06/10/72726/want-more-traditional-chinese-food-panda-express-s/,"While many Americans are familiar with dishes like egg foo young, there are Chinese-American and Chinese immigrant communities throughout the country where foods like ma po tofu and congee are also on menus.

And Panda Express, America's biggest Chinese fast-food chain, hopes to make those more traditional dishes mainstream. ""Panda Express ... has the opportunity to be the ambassador of Chinese food to many people,"" says Andrea Cherng, the company's chief marketing officer.

Chern's parents opened Panda Express in 1983, at a time when Chinese food was still seen as ""exotic."" It's now America's biggest Chinese fast-food chain, with more than 1,900 locations around the world.

But as Americans have become more curious, adventurous eaters, the challenge for the chain is to keep up with the changing food culture — while still seeming familiar enough not to alienate those many mall and airport diners who come to the chain for its Americanized spin on Chinese food.

""Our job at Panda Express is to follow that journey of how palates have grown,"" Cherng says.

A history of adaptation for American palates

Over the years, critics have often knocked Panda Express for serving up ""mediocre"" Chinese food that you wouldn't actually find on a menu in China. (Buzzfeed went so far as to create a video called ""Chinese People Try Panda Express for the First Time."") But the story of Chinese food in America has always been one of adaptation.

""It still takes time for many Americans to like Chinese food,"" says historian Haiming Liu, author of ""From Canton Restaurant to Panda Express: A History of Chinese Food in the United States. ""It's a historical problem for Chinese food, and Chinese restaurants have to do something about it.""

As Liu explains, Chinese food didn't start to become popular in the U.S. until the 20th century. Before that, hundreds of thousands of Chinese laborers who landed on the West Coast in the mid 19th century — to help build railroads, farm and mine — were met with deep racism.

Many non-Chinese were suspicious of the newcomers and saw them as competition for jobs. Those racist, nativist attitudes extended to cuisine: Prejudiced Americans complained of the stench of Chinatown's kitchens, and editorials asked whether ""Chinese eat rats?""

Liu says anti-Chinese fervor on the West Coast prompted some Chinese to head East. And that's why, ""in the 1900s, Chinese restaurants started to grow really fast in places like New York City,"" says Liu. (As The Salt has reported, a loophole in immigration law also played a big role in the Chinese restaurant boom of the 1910s.)

In New York, Chinese immigrants found diners that were more open-minded — as long as the recipes were adapted for American palates, Liu says.

Americans didn't care for the strong, pungent flavors of ingredients that might have been used in traditional Chinese cooking such as bitter melon, black mushrooms or mustard greens. So chefs adapted.

""In American-style Chinese food, the vegetables used tend to be crunchy but flavorless – broccoli, carrots, celery, bean sprouts,"" says Jennifer 8. Lee, whose documentary, The Search for General Tso, traces the roots and myths of the popular American Chinese chicken dish. ""Chop suey, for example, is based on a familiar dish, but it's not something you see Chinese people eat. It became this food that completely catered to Western tastes.""

American-Chinese cuisine got an additional profile boost in the 1960s, when the U.S. overhauled immigration laws that had previously kept may Asians out. A flood of new immigrants were able to come from different regions of China, like the Sichuan and Hunan provinces, and they brought their regional cuisines with them, Liu says.

Those newcomers also tended to be more affluent than their predecessors, and that made an impression on non-Chinese Americans, says Liu. ""Americans realized that Chinese people can be rich and wealthy,"" he says, ""and their food could be good, accordingly."" (Indeed, the way immigrant cuisines are valued in America has often reflected the way those immigrants themselves are seen.) But those immigrants who opened restaurants still adapted and softened their dishes so they would be welcomed by their new country.

That's a tradition that Panda Express — which was born in California's San Gabriel Valley, home to a large Chinese-American population — followed as it expanded throughout America.

Searching for the next orange chicken hit

""There is this bridge that we are making from our Chinese heritage to a wider American audience,"" says Cherng. ""How do we introduce the flavors that we experience around the San Gabriel Valley to the mainstream?""

Take the chain's single most popular dish, orange chicken. It makes up a third of its sales, but it's not a traditional Chinese recipe: Developed in the 1980s, the dish actually sprung from a blend of cuisines that Panda Express' then-head chef had tasted, both in China's Sichuan province and in Hawaii.

Though orange chicken is often derided as ""inauthentic,"" Cherng believes the dish honors the food of her family because it evolved to suit its surroundings, just as her own immigrant parents did when they first moved to America in the mid-1960s.

So she and her team have been looking to the cuisine her friends and family grew up on to discover the next orange chicken-like hit.

Helping her on that quest is Jimmy Wang, who works as Panda Express' ""innovation chef. He's developing recipes that are familiar enough to Americans, but also familiar to Chinese people trying an Americanized version of a classic dish.

""We want to make sure that whatever we change isn't a sacrifice, but an enhancement,"" he says. ""We don't want to be so focused on the history of it that we forget that we need to make a delicious dish at the end of the day.""

For example, in developing Panda Express' recipe for Pacific Chili Shrimp, Wang needed to find an alternative for the fermented, nutty flavor of Chinese black vinegar that's traditionally used. ""A lot of times, customers would say that it tasted weird,"" he says.

So he swapped in distilled, white vinegar. And instead of adding heat from the fermented chili paste, he used crushed chilis. ""It's warm and less abrasive,"" says Wang, ""and it's something that customers have had before.""

Changing those ingredients may get the dish away from its origins, but it's a modification that makes it accessible to more diners, says Wang. ""If there's history tied to something that we know of, then that's good start,"" Wang says.

One traditional dish that the chain altered and is now trying out in certain Southern California outlets: cōng yóu bing, also known as a scallion pancake. Less traditional is how Cherng envisions diners eating it — like a wrap or a burrito, stuffed with orange chicken or other entrees.

Cherng and chef Wang are testing out lots of other recipes, too, like a beef brisket stew inspired by hóng shāo niú ròu, a dish of braised beef that Wang's mother and grandmother used to make for him when he was growing up in Taiwan.

""The best that American Chinese food can bring to bear is taking parts of the past – the flavors that we know – and bringing it forward in original ways,"" says Cherng.","Sat, 10 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://a.scpr.org/i/b1f2b67bb68bc70ef1e4e4a557101c2e/162348-full.jpg,"['chinese', 'express', 'traditional', 'dish', 'wang', 'cherng', 'try', 'liu', 'used', 'food', 'panda', 'americans']",

[Photo/Xinhua]

Although Chinese Premier Li Keqiang's trip to Germany and Belgium from May 31 to June 2 aided China's diplomatic relations with the two countries, the 19th China-EU leaders' meeting from June 1 to 2 in Brussels ended without a joint consensus about granting Market Economy Status (MES) to China in the World Trade Organization (WTO).

During his meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Li persuaded European leaders to accord the status of ""Market Economy"" to China and relax their actions regarding the dumping of Chinese goods.

In his keynote speech at the 19th China-EU leaders' meeting, Premier Li Keqiang urged the European Union (EU) to fulfill its obligations under Article 15 of the protocol on China's accession to the WTO, so as to pave the way towards a stable development of China-EU relations. He stressed that Article 15 is a sunset provision and that all sides should act in line with WTO rules.

China became the 143rd member of the WTO on December 11, 2001, after 15 years of arduous and prolonged negotiations. Over the past 15 years, China has made great contributions to the WTO's multilateral trading system as well as to global economic growth.

Since joining the WTO, China has strictly adhered to WTO rules by gradually reducing tariff levels. China has also actively assumed its responsibilities as a major developing trading nation, cutting its overall tariff rate from 15.3 percent to 9.8 percent. It has long been an advocate of free trade, as evidenced by the fact that it has to date signed 14 free trade agreements with 22 countries.

According to Article 15, WTO members should have stopped using the surrogate country approach to conduct anti-dumping investigations on China by December 11, 2016. Under the surrogate country approach, WTO members use costs of production in a third country to calculate the value of products from countries on its ""non-market economy"" list, which includes China.

China should receive Market Economy Status, which would allow it to enjoy the same market status as the United States and the European Union when it comes to anti-dumping investigations in the WTO. Since the WTO's establishment in 1995, EU members have launched 1,149 trade investigations into China.

In a biased, myopic move, the EU continues to deny Market Economy Status to China on the basis that China is not yet a proper free market. European companies complain that they cannot easily penetrate the Chinese marketplace. Europe does not want to let relatively cheaper Chinese goods flood European markets at a higher rate for fear of undermining local economies. The excuses put forward by the EU are discriminatory.

The EU's censure of China as being accountable for the steel glut in the 28-country bloc is untenable. China's steel exports to the EU are small compared to other countries. China's low value-added steel products are complementary to the EU's steel market portfolio. Without exports from China, the EU would still have to turn to other countries to import similar products. That will not stem job losses in the EU.

China's leadership in boosting regional and global economies through programs such as the ""Belt and Road"" initiative was supported by WTO reviewers during the sixth round of the Trade Policy Review (TPR) of WTO in Geneva last July.

However, during the meeting with Premier Li Keqiang, Chancellor Angela Merkel confirmed that the EU will offer equal treatment to Chinese enterprises under the protocol on China's accession to the WTO. Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said that his country is ready to play an active part to push the EU to fulfill its WTO obligations. But a majority of the EU members has failed to reach a consensus on accepting China's Market Economy Status.

It should be noted that over 80 countries, including Russia, New Zealand, Singapore and Australia, have recognized China's status as a market economy.

In fact, China's ""non-market"" label has become a wild card to the EU and the U.S. to contain China's exports and shield local industries, which is unfair. As the world's second largest economy and the largest trade partner for more than 130 countries, China has become a bedrock for protecting global free trade.

The EU and U.S. should not continue to look at China through colored glasses. As an important member of the WTO, the EU should designate China as a market economy if it can truly see the bigger picture of EU-China trade, especially at a time when the Trump administration has stepped back from America's traditional role of dominance on trade and development.

Agricultural crops in southern Taiwan completely submerged in water. (CNA photo)

TAIPEI (Taiwan News)—Although Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has not released official figures on the total economic losses incurred from the extreme torrential rainfall over the last few days, certain industries have reported severe damage.

Farmers have been particularly hard hit by flash floods, and reported a total loss exceeding NT$40 million (US$1.33 million) as of Sunday noon, reported UDN.

Hardest hit regions included Yunlin County, amounting to 54 percent of losses or NT$21.69 million, followed by New Taipei City's NT$9.36 million (23 percent), and Chiayi County's NT$4.23 million (11 percent), and Changhua County's NT$2.28 million (6 percent).

Some rice paddies were completely submerged by the floods in Yunlin County, so it is no surprise rice was the agricultural crop most affected by the deluges that ensued from heavy torrential rains, reporting a loss of NT$11.46 million, according to the Council of Agriculture (COA).

Other crops affected by floods included watermelons, peanuts, corn, and mushrooms.

A mushroom farmer claimed to have lost NT$150,000 in one day, while another poultry farmer lost equipment and chicken feed to the rain and reported a loss of NT$50 million.

Overflowing fishery ponds in Yunlin County resulted in the escape of thousands of catfish to nearby ditches, causing the fish farmer to lose most of his prized fish to hundreds of villagers who scrambled to catch a free catfish for dinner.

Aside from agricultural losses, mudslides and rockslides caused by the heavy rains have also led to the destruction of five houses in Nantou County and swept away 12 houses in Kaohsiung City.

More people are being evacuated from villages in mountainous areas that are prone to landslides, mudslides, and rockslides as part of safety preventive measures during this time period.

The New Taipei City government has evacuated 1,724 people in advance as the torrential rain front shifts back north.

Large government investments will be required to repair critical infrastructure in the near future, including three damaged bridges, the Northern Cross-Island Highway, the Southern Cross-Island Highway, and Alishan Mountain Highway.

Bridges completely destroyed by the flood include Kuang River Bridge (磺溪橋) in Jinshan District of New Taipei City, Longhua Bridge (龍華橋) and Aicun Bridge (愛村橋)in Nantou County.

The New Taipei City government estimates repairs for the Kuang River Bridge will cost between NT$50 million and NT$100 million, but no figures for the other two broken bridges have been released yet.

Keelung City Mayor Lin Yu-chang (林右昌) projects losses incurred by the city over the last few days from flooding caused by the extreme torrential rain reached NT$400 million.

A total of 384 flights were canceled from June 2 to June 4, including two international flights. More than 100,000 passengers were affected by canceled or delayed flights, according to Apple Daily estimates.

As the rain continues unabated, more flooding is expected throughout the island, resulting in larger economic losses.","Sun, 04 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://tnimage.s3.hicloud.net.tw/photos/shares/5933bb421820a.jpg,"['million', 'losses', 'reported', 'infrastructure', 'causes', 'bridge', 'county', 'taipei', 'city', 'severe', 'damage', 'rain', 'torrential', 'completely', 'crops', 'extreme']",

The low-lying island is connected to Ile Bizard by a short bridge which began flooding in April, and was washed out on May 6. It was the worst flooding seen on the island since 1998.

Several homes were abandoned as foundations and ground floors crumbled under the pressure of the water flowing over the island.

One house that had parts of its foundation collapse has since been propped up by stacks of beams.

""The house was not stable. They stabilized it so the person can go back in the house and get her things. She'll be able to live in the house,"" said Pier-Luc Cauchon, one of the island's residents.

He said the woman plans to rebuild her foundation and return to living here permanently.

""She sees some light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Cauchon.

Over the past month all but a handful of residents have returned to the four dozen homes on the island.

Cauchon and several others worked hard to save as much as they could during the worst of the flooding, but even so several houses will need to be completely rebuilt.

""Everything can be repaired,"" said Cauchon.

Nearly two months after the flooding began, Cauchon is well aware that living on Ile Mercier and attempting to restore it will be a very long struggle.

""It's hitting you now. When we were defending we were on a high, we were proud of what we were doing,"" said Cauchon.

The borough is helping clean up the island.

As in other areas that were badly damaged by flooding, city workers have hauled away sandbags and other junk that has been left in front yards. But city employees are not going into back yards to help dismantle handmade dikes.

Cauchon is organizing his neighbours to go door-to-door and help out.

Borough Mayor Normand Marinacci said others across the region will assist.

""Just volunteers getting together and they're organizing something in the next few days to help people,"" said Marinacci.

Given the sheer amount of demolition still to take place, let alone construction, it will be months before life on Ile Mercier returns to any sense of normalcy.

Then residents will once again admire the river and wonder if it will be another 20 years until the river runs over their island.","Fri, 09 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.3452402.1497059776!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,"['flood', 'rebuild', 'worst', 'plan', 'devastating', 'help', 'mercier', 'house', 'ile', 'river', 'yards', 'island', 'residents', 'flooding']",

It begins on a driveway in an unidentified part of the Sunshine State. That driveway is badly flooded – there is little short of a reservoir sitting in between the large houses and new cars that line the street.

Confronted with such a hazard, most people would give up, stay inside, wait for the emergency services to hoover up the thousands of gallons of groundwater.

But not the man in the orange T-shirt. He has a bucket. And bucket by bucket he's going to clear the flood from the road and save his neighbourhood.

If you don't like sad endings then you'd best not watch the video.

It was captured on 7 June by the man's neighbour, Nathan Zeff, and uploaded to Facebook, where it has been watched more than 350,000 times.

The bizarre, at times touching images, are complimented by a soundtrack chosen by Zeff himself.

This contribution is a concrete outcome following China’s commitment to food assistance at the Belt and Road Forum held in May this year.

With this contribution, WFP has procured more than 2821.75 metric tonnes of rice from China. Distribution of the Chinese rice will begin as soon as it arrives in Somalia and will provide critical food assistance to drought-affected people in 18 regions of Somalia. Together with China’s contributions of rice, sorghum and Plumpy Sup (a nutritious paste), there is enough food to feed approximately 223,500 people for four months.

“WFP is extremely grateful to the Government of China for its longstanding commitment to addressing urgent humanitarian needs that will substantially boost our efforts to provide vital food support to vulnerable people on the brink of famine. Now, food from China will travel the Maritime Silk Road to support Somalis affected by drought,” said Sixi Qu, WFP China Representative. “The ancient Maritime Silk Road can efficiently link people, supply, transportation and humanitarian assistance. Such connections help countries ‘help each other’ to reach the goal of eradicating poverty and hunger.”

As the drought intensifies, particularly in the southern and north-eastern parts of Somalia, severe food insecurity has spread. Half of the population, including 363,000 acutely malnourished children under five, is in need of urgent assistance. WFP will continue to ramp up its assistance to reach 3.4 million people over the next six months through emergency food assistance as well as specially fortified nutrition support for women and young children.

WFP is the world's largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide, delivering food assistance in emergencies and working with communities to improve nutrition and build resilience. Each year, WFP assists some 80 million people in around 80 countries.

68,68,FL-2017-000062-TWN,Inflatable rubber dams - Pakistan - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1340303,"THE irrigation department of Punjab has come up with a proposal of introducing inflatable rubber dams for the eastern rivers in the province to serve not only as small water storages, but also, improve the biodiversity of the area which was degraded owing to drying up of the waterways as a result of the Indus Water Treaty 1960.

The irrigation department has so far identified eight points — four each at Sutlej and Ravi rivers — for the construction of these proposed rubber dams.

The feasibility study and a detailed design for the pilot project in Bahawalpur district has been prepared by The Project Implementation Consultants — a joint venture of Messrs ACE, Nespak and SMEC.

“In fact, the consultants have studied three sites — one on the Ravi (Okara-Faisalabad bridge) and two on the Sutlej (Bahawalpur-Lodhran Road bridge and Bahawalpur N-5 bridge).

But the Bahawalpur-Lodhran Road bridge on River Sutlej has been selected for the construction of the first such facility, keeping in view the socio-political acceptability considerations, according to an official of the irrigation department, involved with the project’s planning.

This idea is in vogue in developed nations like the USA, Canada, Italy and Spain and developing states like China, India and Bangladesh. China boasts over 2,000 rubber dams, while Bangladesh has built several dozens of them so far.

“The inflatable dams are a good option during low flow as well as high floods. For in case of flood, the rubber weir may be deflated within hours to allow the strong current to pass through the channel while a concrete weir will be washed away”

“Currently, the proposal is lying with the donors, both the provincial government as well as the world agencies interested in lending for water projects, to seek funds for its implementation.”

The inflatable rubber dams are rubber-coated cylindrical fabrics placed across water channels, fixed to concrete foundation by bars and anchorage bolts, to raise the upstream water for irrigation, flood control or other uses. Air, water or a combination of both are used to inflate the tubes.

In the proposed Bahawalpur Bridge project, a 2.5 metres high and 155.3 metres long inflatable weir will be installed on top of the spillway which is divided into four bays, the official says, adding, it will create an approximately 13km-long lake upstream at a cost of around Rs3bn.

The cost includes the compensation amount to be paid to the owners of the land within the main creek of River Sutlej. The construction period will span over 18 months.

Besides serving as a water storage dam for irrigation purposes, it will also help recharge ground water aquifer and improve availability of water for drinking purpose in the project impact area.

Coupled with enhanced availability of tubewell irrigation due to recharged aquifer, it will help in improved crop yields and generate agro-economic benefits, the official says.

The 13km lake can also be used for fish farming as well as for recreational activities like boating, while its impact on biodiversity of the area will also be significant, he said, pointing out the additional benefits of the plan, adding, “Consequent upon the success of the pilot project, a series of similar projects will be replicated in the remaining reaches of Sutlej and Ravi rivers.”

A technical member of the project team says mechanical equipment of the rubber dam, including auto deflation system, air compressor for activating pneumatic valves, air blowers and control panels, will be housed in a four-story building.

The official says that initially construction points on the rivers have been identified where concrete foundations or platforms are already available in the form of bridges to keep the costs low.

About the strength and reliability of the fabric used, he says, “It could sustain knife cuts and has a life span of over two decades.”

A consultant of the water and power authority (requesting anonymity) supported the rubber dam proposal saying, “The technology may be used to build small reservoirs to meet the needs of the impact area, while it entails no damages in any respect.

The inflatable dams are a good option during low flow as well as high floods. For in case of flood, the rubber weir may be deflated within hours to allow the strong current to pass through the channel while a concrete weir will be washed away.”

Former Chairman Wapda, Engineer Shamsul Mulk, said he can give his professional opinion on the proposal only after going through its feasibility study but stressed that ‘known technologies’ should be preferred for the development of water reservoirs.

June 02, 2017 - 12:57 PM

KAMLOOPS - It was 45 years ago today that a devastating flood hit the small community of Oak Hills in Kamloops' Westsyde neighbourhood.

Sheila Webster remembers the day it happened. She was in town for an appointment when she heard the news break over the radio.

""(I was) definitely worried because of the sounds of the news,"" she says. ""I figured there was definitely work to be done, but had no idea how much water there was at the time.""

The dike in Oak Hills was undergoing construction and Webster says the work created a crevice which led to it breaking, causing a fast flood.

When Webster got back to Oak Hills, she couldn't believe how much water was affecting her community. Her home that she, her husband and their two daughters moved into three weeks prior was only accessible by boat.

Her husband took a boat to their home while Webster hung back to help people unload their things they retrieved from their homes.

""Everything that was in the basement was destroyed,"" Webster says. ""It was definitely an experience that involved the whole city, I’d say. I mean, mobile homes were floating.""

Webster says there was never a lack of help thanks to the community coming together to help their neighbours in need.

""It did affect a lot of people, it wasn’t just our story,"" she says. ""It was an experience not to be forgotten.""

Webster and her family were able to move back into their new Oak Hills home two months after the flood, and after a lot of repairs. Their basement wall had caved in due to all of the water.

Although the material loss and property damage in the area was significant, Webster is glad everyone in the community made it out alive and well. But as she looks at the river levels today, she can't help but be reminded of the situation in Oak Hills.

""We took a drive out there this morning, out to Westsyde and the river’s pretty high,"" she says. ""I know that Oak Hills certainly wouldn’t be in trouble... (but) when the water gets high like this it certainly brings back memories of what we went through.""

Both the North Thompson and South Thompson rivers are currently on a flood watch. Rivers Trail downtown along with boat launches are being shut down for public safety.

In Savona, Kamloops Lake is expected to reach historical levels. Residents are expecting shoreline flooding similar to what they saw during the 2012 flood.

The New Haven-based restaurant was conceived by Yale grads Yong Zhao, Wanting Zhang, and Ming Bai with chef Lucas Sin, who created a Northern China-based menu of noodle bowls and bings in the first location in 2015.

Junzi Kitchen has a Chipotle-like menu, with either a bing or noodles as the base, with various meats, vegetables, garnishes, and sauce options to mix in. The full menu for the NYC location is below and includes some rather cheffy ingredients for a fast-casual chain, such as chive ash and shrimp salt.

Because of an emphasis on efficiency and low prices, fast-casual restaurants can front businesses first more than full-service spots do — and Junzi Kitchen is no exception. Chinese Yale grad students created this case study of a concept while studying there, opening the first location in New Haven in October 2015 with the Yale Entrepreneurial Institute.

With customizable orders, Junzi Kitchen is a departure from another Chinese fast-casual spot, Xi’an Famous Foods which is dominating the NYC fast-casual space, with orders hitting a comparable price point — around $11. Co-owner Jason Wang similarly used his business school skills to grow the business, and Xi’an Famous Foods also has a location near Columbia and harbors aggressive expansion plans.

81,81,FL-2017-000062-TWN,The Indian Navy’s humanitarian impulse - Livemint,https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/5yMHIeapeZianzdanLf9JN/The-Indian-Navys-humanitarian-impulse.html,"One of the defining characteristics of navies in the postmodern era is their involvement in irregular security missions. From anti-piracy to anti-trafficking, counter-terrorism and migration control, the scope of unconventional security tasks undertaken by maritime forces in recent years has expanded significantly. The most prominent of these tasks has been humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR), aimed at helping populations in coastal areas survive natural calamities. Since the Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004, when giant waves originating in the waters off Sumatra submerged huge swathes of coastal South and South-East Asia, disaster relief has formed an important part of the broader mission-set of maritime forces.

The Indian Navy has played a leading role in humanitarian operations in the Indian Ocean littorals. Beginning with the 2004 tsunami, when 19 Indian naval ships conducted relief operations in Sri Lanka, Indonesia and the Maldives, the Indian Navy and Coast Guard have regularly participated in HADR missions in South Asia, West Asia and even the South China Sea, carrying out relief operations, search and rescue and emergency evacuations of people in need of urgent assistance.

Over the last fortnight, the Narendra Modi government showed once again why humanitarian assistance remains a vital component of India’s regional political outreach. After major floods and landslides killed over 200 people in Sri Lanka, Indian naval ships rushed to provide relief to the affected people in the island state. In what was widely reported as the worst spell of rainfall since the 1970s in Sri Lanka, Indian naval vessels played a key role in stabilizing the island nation’s flood-affected areas, providing critical relief supplies and medical assistance.

New Delhi was quick to respond to an appeal for assistance by the Sri Lankan government, dispatching naval ships within hours of the first report detailing the scale of the unfolding tragedy in Colombo. The INS Kirch, on its way back from deployment in the Maldives, was diverted south, even as the INS Shardul and INS Jalashwa were ordered to sail with dispatch for relief operations. A day later, the INS Sumitra was involved in a search and rescue operation in Bangladesh, where cyclone Mora had caused significant destruction of property and life. The Indian warship rescued 33 people swept into the sea by the cyclone—the second time in less than a month that Indian naval assets had been involved in a rescue of this nature, after INS Kirch and a Dornier aircraft carried out a search and salvage operation off the Maldives, recovering a local landing craft lost in the waters between the Thulusdhoo and Gan islands.

The Indian Navy’s humanitarian impulse also manifests in the many evacuation operations from countries in the grip of political turmoil and rapidly deteriorating security conditions that Indian warships have undertaken in recent years. In April 2015, Indian ships were involved in the safe evacuation of over 2,000 Indian expatriates and over 1,300 foreign nationals from an intense combat zone in Yemen. Indian naval ships have previously carried out rescue missions in Libya, Lebanon and Somalia, where political turmoil left scores of Indian nationals stranded in conflict zones with little hope of survival.

Even so, India’s governing elite know that the Indian Navy isn’t the only security provider in South Asia. Like other occasions in the recent past, the Colombo floods witnessed an active contribution from many other regional maritime forces, including the Chinese navy, which sent three warships, and the Pakistan navy. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) navy’s humanitarian efforts in the Indian Ocean have been a trigger for disquiet in India’s defence establishment. After Chinese warships evacuated 35,000 Chinese nationals from Libya (2011), and PLA navy’s specialized vessels carried out a search for the remains of Malaysian airliner MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean (2014), India’s naval leadership suspects Beijing might be using humanitarian operations to boost its security and diplomatic influence in South Asia.

Unfortunately, the Indian Navy’s humanitarian cause has been adversely affected by the absence of a dedicated platform for disaster relief missions. Unlike the US and China, whose navies have hospital ships fully equipped for medical assistance, India deploys regular warships and amphibious vessels converted for search, rescue and relief missions. In terms of both optics and utility, India’s improvised platforms do not match the US navy’s medical ship USNS Mercy or the PLA navy’s Peace Ark—custom-made hospital ships that enable specialized medical services on a grander, more visible scale, allowing for the leveraging of humanitarian service for diplomatic gains.

Still, India’s keen involvement in multiple relief missions in Asia is a reminder that as natural disasters become more frequent and intense, New Delhi’s contribution to humanitarian missions will rise incrementally. With the growing urbanization of coastal areas, Indian naval ships will increasingly find themselves at the forefront of rescue and relief effects in disaster-hit states. Inevitably, Indian vessels will be first on the scene, rendering critical life-saving assistance in the early hours of a natural disaster, as in the case of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh recently.

The Indian Navy’s humanitarian mission is likely to remain a key factor in India’s projection of diplomatic soft power and a potent symbol of New Delhi’s neighbourhood-first policy.

83,83,FL-2017-000062-TWN,In-depth: New BP data shows emissions flat in 2016 with record rise in renewables - Carbon Brief,https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-new-bp-data-shows-emissions-flat-2016-record-rise-renewables,"The world added a record amount of energy from renewable sources in 2016 and global coal use fell again, according to the 2017 BP Statistical Review of World Energy, published earlier this week. This helped to keep global CO2 emissions flat for the third year in a row, even as energy demand rose.

The record 53 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) added by non-hydro renewables met a third of the increase in global energy demand. Global coal use fell by 53Mtoe (1.4%) and is now 4% below the 2014 peak.

Meanwhile, coal production fell by a record 231Mtoe (5.9%), as massive output declines continued in the US and China worked to reduce overcapacity and combat air pollution.

Carbon Brief runs through BP’s new data and highlights some of the key changes in global energy production and use last year.

Record renewables

Non-hydro renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, had a record year in 2016, adding 53Mtoe. They were the fastest-growing source of energy, up 14%, in line with average growth of 16% per year over the decade to 2015. Together with nuclear and hydro, low carbon energy supplied more than half of the net increase in global energy demand between 2015 and 2016.

Global energy demand grew 171Mtoe (1.0%), with 87% of this growth coming from developing countries. Oil (up 77Mtoe, 1.8%) and gas (57Mtoe, 1.8%) met the largest portions of this increase.

It’s worth noting that the 1.7% increase in developing country energy demand last year was well below the 3.7% average of the decade to 2015. China was notable for its slow growth of 1.3%, just one-quarter of its decade-long average.

The continuing decline in global coal demand, down 53Mtoe (1.4%) last year and 105Mtoe (2.7%) the year before was picked up by much of the media coverage of the new BP data and is worth exploring in more detail, see below.

Demand growth

Despite the rapid growth of renewables, described in a recent Financial Times headline as “unstoppable”, clean energy sources continue to lag well behind fossil fuels (see chart, below).

As the chart shows, however, non-hydro renewables are now approaching the energy output of global nuclear power. At recent rates of growth of 16% per year, these renewable sources would outpace the current output from nuclear by 2019, hydro by 2022 and gas by 2030.

Along with the fall in coal use seen since 2014, renewable growth means fossil fuels’ share of the mix is at a record low of 85.5%, down half a percentage point since last year. This trend away from fossil fuels is accelerating, having been on hold during the 2000s as China’s coal use exploded.

Taking a longer-term perspective, a half century ago, fossil fuels met 94% of global energy demand. Even at the current, more rapid rate of change, they could still be supplying the majority of the world’s energy needs for decades to come – a point made repeatedly in energy outlooks from BP, Shell and the International Energy Agency (IEA), among others.

On the other hand, these outlooks have consistently underestimated the rate of growth of renewables and the decline of coal, with BP, for example, being “surprise[d]” six years running. In its latest energy outlook, BP saw global coal use peaking around 2025-2030, whereas the recent trend suggests a peak could have been reached already in 2014.

The IEA has also come under heavy criticism for continuing to assume linear renewables growth (a steady increase in absolute terms each year), even though the trend has been exponential (a steady increase in percentage terms). This trend is clear in the chart, below.

Energy from non-hydro renewables increased by 14% on a global basis in 2016, with notable outliers including China (up 33%), India (up 29%) and Japan (27%). There was also strong growth in some African countries, including Egypt (36%) and South Africa (26%).

Globally, as for overall energy use, the strongest demand was in developing (non-OECD) nations, where renewables grew 27% between 2015 and 2016. In wealthier OECD nations, renewables grew by 8%, with the US up 17% and the EU up just 0.5%.

Decisive decline

The most striking change in fortunes in recent years has been for global coal demand, which fell by 53Mtoe (1.4%) in 2016, marking a second consecutive year of decline. However, this fall, while significant, was only around half the 105Mtoe fall recorded last year, suggesting a rebound in demand is possible.

(It’s worth noting that BP has revised its estimate for the fall in global coal use in 2015, raising it from the 71Mtoe reported at the time. This revision includes larger declines in coal use for China and the US.)

China’s coal use has now fallen for three years running, leaving it down 88Mtoe (4.1%) from a peak in 2013. This peak in Chinese coal use has been the primary driver of declines in global coal use, and also CO2 emissions. It has raised hopes that China can step up its role in tackling climate change, as the US under Donald Trump steps away from the global stage.

As ever, however, it’s worth noting the complexities and uncertainties around Chinese coal data. Earlier this year, Carbon Brief published an in-depth guest article describing what has been going on in the country, which concluded: “Uncertainty is high and the longer-term trend is still unclear”

Along with China, there were also significant falls in coal use in the US (down 33Mtoe, 8.7%) and the EU (down 23Mtoe, also 8.7%). In both cases, this decline was linked to coal-to-gas switching and an increase in renewable energy output.

In the US, where president Donald Trump has promised to revive the fortunes of coal, it’s worth noting that demand is down by two-fifths in the past decade. Recent analysis suggests this trend is unlikely to be reversed, regardless of Trump’s efforts.

India, now the world’s second-largest coal consumer after China, continues to increase demand, up 15Mtoe (3.9%) last year. Its planned new coal plants could single-handedly jeopardise the 1.5C warming limit, though doubts are gathering over how many of the planned plants will be built.

In analysis published alongside the figures, Spencer Dale, BP chief economist writes:

“The fortunes of coal appear to have taken a decisive break from the past. This shift largely reflects structural factors: the increasing availability and competitiveness of natural gas and renewables, combined with government and societal pressure to shift towards cleaner, lower carbon fuels.”

Supply and demand

One intriguing dynamic last year was the divergence between coal production and use. The BP figures show production fell by a record 231Mtoe (5.9%), whereas demand fell by only 53Mtoe. This split drove a huge rally in coal prices, with supply and demand out of balance.

Coal production saw the largest year-on-year declines on record for both China (down 140Mtoe, 7.7%) and the US (84Mtoe, 18.8%). The US fall is particularly striking, given Trump’s promises to the industry.

US coal output in 2016 was the lowest ever recorded by BP, in figures going back 35 years. The decline slowed through 2016, however, having been down 26% in the first half of the year, as operators responded to rising prices. Output is expected to increase slightly this year.

The decrease in China’s coal production from 2015 to 2016 was nearly four times larger than the decrease from 2014 to 2015. Both production and consumption of coal in China are now back below 2011 levels.

The fall in Chinese production was driven by restrictions on coal mining operations, limited to 276 days per year last spring before being eased later in the year. It is also conducting a war on pollution, forcing hundreds of steel and coal companies to close or reduce output.

Flat emissions

The record year for renewables, coupled with a second year of declines for coal, saw global CO2 emissions remain flat for the third year in a row, the BP figures show, increasing by just 0.1%. This confirms independent analyses published by the Global Carbon Project and the IEA.

This emissions flatline follows a decade of increases at an average rate of 2.5% per year. According to BP, the break in this trend can be traced back to China and reflects a combination of long-term structural change and short-term cyclical factors. Again, it’s worth looking back on Carbon Brief’s recent in-depth guest article on China.





Energy-related CO2 emissions around the world between 1965 and 2016. Source: BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2017 . Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts

In Asia, CO2 emissions continued to fall in China (down 41 million tonnes of CO2, MtCO2, 0.7%) and Japan (down 15MtCO2, 1.5%). These falls were slightly outweighed by increases in many other Asian countries, notably Indonesia (up 39MtCO2, 7.6%), India (114MtCO2, 5%) and Pakistan (up 16MtCO2, 8.5%).

In the US, emissions fell by 95MtCO2 (3.7%) whereas in the EU, they were up 8MtCO2 (0.2%). (Note that the European Environment Agency estimates that EU emissions fell slightly in 2016, by 0.4%. Either way, power sector emissions fell due to switching from coal to gas, while emissions from transport and heating increased slightly).

Given recent boasts from US secretary of state Rex Tillerson, it’s worth taking a longer-term view on these emissions, however, with the US 3.7% above 1990 levels and the EU 19.6% below. Over the past 10 years, the EU has cut its emissions by 19% against just 11% for the US.





Conclusion

The latest BP figures reveal another remarkable year for global energy in 2016, with a “decisive” turn away from coal and another record for renewables keeping CO2 emissions flat. There was also a record decline in global coal production, driven by low prices globally and then mining controls in China, which saw coal markets rally.

Clean energy supplied more than half of the increase in global demand, increasing its share of the energy mix. Nevertheless, fossil fuels still supply the lion’s share of demand, at 85.5%, down less than 10 percentage points from the 94% recorded half a century ago.

These trends illustrate the scale of the challenge if the world is to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, which will require emissions to not just remain flat, but to fall to net-zero soon after 2050.","Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wind-turbine.jpg,"['coal', 'global', 'demand', 'flat', 'data', '2016', 'energy', 'renewables', 'emissions', 'indepth', 'rise', 'shows', 'carbon', 'bp', 'record', 'world', 'china']", 
84,84,FL-2017-000062-TWN,Low prices to pile more pressure on beleaguered nickel miners - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nickel-market-supply-idUSKBN18Y0K2,"MELBOURNE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Global nickel miners are coming under renewed pressure to cut costs or close capacity as a flood of cheap ore pushes prices to one-year lows, with analysts seeing little prospect of recovery.

Indonesia and the Philippines are ramping up shipments of nickel ore after Indonesia relaxed an ore export ban earlier this year and a hardline Filipino environmentalist was ousted from the country’s mining ministry.

Nickel ore is popular as a cheaper alternative to refined metal for China’s vast steel mills, which use the metal to add strength to stainless steel.

The renewed supply comes as the market is already struggling with softening demand and high stocks, leading a slew of banks to slash their forecasts despite prices having already fallen 60 percent since mid-2014 80 percent from their 2007 peak.

Citi recently told clients that for the first time in 10 years it saw little chance of a rally in the short, medium or long term.

“Miners have been holding on as long as they can. They will be close to running out of wiggle room in terms of cutting costs,” said Mark Pervan at consultancy AME Group in Sydney.

“We need to see some reasonably sized refined capacity cutbacks to restore prices and confidence back to the market.”

Consultant Wood Mackenzie estimates that more than half of the world’s nickel industry is running at a loss. High cost mines include those in the Dominican Republic, Greece, Cuba, Western Australia and New Caledonia, analysts said.

Brazil’s Vale has already said that it plans to suspend two of its older high-cost Canadian mines this year.

“Prices have persisted for some time now and our focus throughout this period has been on reducing costs and improving performance throughout our operations globally,” Vale spokesman Cory McPhee said.

New Caledonia, home to three of the world’s top-10 projects, is one of the highest cost producers.

Christel Bories, CEO of France’s Eramet said recently that losses at its Societe Le Nickel (SLN) operations were “not sustainable”, while Vale NC, a branch of Brazil’s Vale, said its Q1 cost of production stood at $11,232, well above the LME nickel price around $8,890.

The French government, however, has supported both mines with state loans, aimed at protecting jobs.

Some mines, such as the Falcondo ferronickel plant in the Dominican Republic, exited the market when prices last dipped. That mine since returned under new ownership.

Mines built during periods of high prices could be the first on the chopping block, while some operations could be wound down ahead of their expected closure dates, said analysts.

However, an impediment to closure was that many mines are run by diversified mining companies that derive most of their revenue from other minerals.

“In Australia we see the likes of Leinster and Long coming to end of mine life, in 2017 and 2018 respectively, so operations like these could close earlier,” Wood Mackenzie analyst Angela Durrant said.

Both BHP’s Leinster mine, part of its Nickel West operations, and Independence Group’s Long mine are situated in Western Australia.

Independence Group, which also mines gold and copper, was not available for comment but has said previously it wants to expand its Long project.

BHP has said Nickel West is not part of its core portfolio, but chief commercial officer, Arnoud Balhuizen, said this month the miner was still running the Nickel West business for value.","Wed, 07 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170607&t=2&i=1187908829&r=LYNXMPED560DH&w=800,"['ore', 'low', 'miners', 'beleaguered', 'running', 'operations', 'long', 'prices', 'nickel', 'pile', 'vale', 'west', 'pressure', 'high', 'mines']",

Stands of tall pines stick out like pale arboreal skeletons throughout the marsh on this island lashed by the Chesapeake Bay. The trees are dying farther and farther inland as salt water poisons the soil, an ominous sign that the rising sea is reclaiming this land.

Some on the island and the peninsula that connects it to eastern Maryland can trace their ancestry back 300 years or more. But rising sea levels, connected to climate change as well as land sinking since the last ice age, have steadily consumed Deal Island as their kin are born and buried. Old-timers speak of plucking buckets of arrowheads from beaches that now lie underneath the bay.

Scientists are concerned that the ghost forests are a sign that within the next generation or so, parts of the island will become uninhabitable. Much more, they say, could be subjected to flooding so frequent it would make living here almost impossible.

Deal Island is on the front lines of climate change. Even under the rosiest scenarios, in which sea levels rise only 2 feet by 2100, much of the island will be underwater in a few generations. Rising global temperatures are expected to wipe out businesses, marinas and homes.

Still, climate change isn’t a popular phrase here. Many of those whose families have scraped out a living, largely through the bay’s bounty of crabs and oysters, attribute the retreating ground to erosion, or “land loss.”

“Some of the arguments are a little silly,” said Stephen White, a longtime resident of the region. “We have climate change four times a year. I’m concerned about erosion.”

In some sense, Deal Island, a three-hour drive from Washington, is a microcosm of America today. This is Trump country, and many of those who live here are deeply rooted in Methodist faith, are politically conservative and are wary of outsiders or government restrictions on their way of life.

It’s just across the bay from Tangier Island, the mayor of which received a surprise call from President Trump this week. Trump told him not to worry about rising sea levels because the island is going to be there “for a long time.” Scientists say Tangier Island is in a far more precarious position than that and could be uninhabitable two or three decades from now.

And yet one relatively modest effort may offer a glimmer of hope for a divided country. The residents here need a climate policy that prepares their most vulnerable people for the flooded future that scientists say is on the way. It could happen within the lifetimes of these islanders, or some of them.

On Deal Island, climate skeptics, anthropologists, crabbers, pastors and scientists have spent the last five years trying to figure out where they can find common ground. Led by social scientists from the University of Maryland, and partially funded by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration sea grant, which is targeted for elimination in the president’s budget proposal, they are talking about mitigation, restoring shorelines, building better drainage ditches and constructing bulkheads to hold back the damaging effect of waves.

People often live in places like Deal Island to be independent, to be free from government oversight and anything that encroaches on their liberty, said Kathleen “Jo” Johnson, a University of Maryland researcher who helps run the project.

Still, she said the community will not be able to handle all of the changes coming in the near future—not on its own. For some things, like repeatedly rebuilding roads, it will need the government.

Researchers were drawn to the area initially because there has been little effort here to prepare for the changes. She said one of the issues the group is wrestling with is whether it’s even appropriate to ask people today to plan for the year 2100, if it means leaving their homes or taking on additional expenses.

“You have to ask yourself, is it appropriate?” she said. “But then you have to get into questions of who decides and what are we planning for and when do we plan for that. So asking everybody out here to give up their land and their livelihood because one day it would be inundated, if you think about it that way, that’s crazy, that’s crazy to ask them that.”

David Webster, a fifth-generation waterman on Deal Island who traces his roots here to the 17th century, has noticed the changes and recognizes that climate change could have some role. Still, he said the first settlers here recognized they wouldn’t be able to stay forever. On a recent day, as he surveyed the construction of holding tanks for the latest catch of soft-shell crabs, he said he plans to remain in the area until he can’t anymore.

Webster, who is also a Methodist pastor and has mentioned climate change from the pulpit on Sunday morning, said the hardest work is not having conversations about climate change. It’s the next step. It’s finding a solution that works for everyone.

“It’s where to take the next step, because that’s the problem, because if it goes on the side of this group that thinks that, well, sea-level rise means we need to change everything we’re doing and we do those things, or if it goes on our side, to where we say, ‘Let God take care of it,’ they’ll be upset,” he said. “It’s the next step that causes the problem. The talking isn’t the problem.”

Climate change or erosion? Does it matter?

Worrying about climate change can almost seem like a luxury for many of those just trying to eke out a living in the poorest county in one of the nation’s wealthiest states. But it’s impossible not to notice the rising seas on Deal Island.

High tides, even on sunny days, can make roads impassable for the school bus. Some residents who leave for work can’t get home at night when their streets are inundated. Cemeteries have been swamped, the salt water eating through the concrete structures that house the coffins, exposing the skulls of those who carved out a living from the marsh and dunes. Some houses, in areas that flood frequently, have already been abandoned.

The Chesapeake Bay has already lost 13 islands to rising waters. Sea levels in the bay rose a foot in the last century. That’s twice the global average, and it could rise 2 feet by 2050, according to researchers at the University of Maryland.

The rising sea levels of the Chesapeake are due to a combination of factors, two of which are related to climate change. The first is that the Atlantic coast is seeing some of the highest increase in global sea-level rise. In addition, as the bay water warms, it is expanding. The land is also sinking after shrinking glaciers in the last ice age caused it to pop up, like a seesaw.

“There are some unique areas, the Chesapeake being one of them, that due to their historically high rate of sea-level rise are feeling the consequences more so than many other areas in our country, maybe outside of Louisiana, and with their high population density, it’s really noticeable,” said William Sweet, an oceanographer at NOAA.

One of the vanished islands belonged to White, a former Methodist minister who tried for decades to save Holland Island, which was once 3 miles long and home to about 400. But humans can only hold angry waves at bay for so long. And in 2010, the last remaining part of the island lost a house that was built around 1890. It was swallowed by the sea, and Holland Island became part of the Chesapeake Bay.

Still, White is unconvinced that climate change is a culprit. He spoke of Holland Island in hushed tones, perhaps reserved for the death of a loved one. Like many on Deal Island, he frets about land loss but doesn’t think the ocean is rising.

White spoke to a reporter amid the boarded-up ruins of his next project—preserving the remains of a Civil War-era church. White, 86, stood among graves dug and capped with concrete in a drier time that are now collapsing into the salty broth of the marsh, revealing glimpses of skeletal remains inside. White believes it’s the result of natural erosion.

Erosion, land loss or climate change, the only thing that really matters is that another foot of sea-level rise, which scientist say is possible in just 30 years, means Deal Island will become further separated from the mainland, as the marshes that surround it are overtaken by the Chesapeake. And while areas of the island are high enough to withstand even 5 feet of sea-level rise, the roads into the island could be nearly impossible to maintain.

For people whose families have made a living from the sea for generations, with its boom-and-bust cycles of crabs and oysters, climate science sounds like something an outsider would use to restrict their way of life, said Michael Paolisso, an anthropologist at the University of Maryland who has worked with residents for about 20 years.

“Where they resist the most is when science comes in and monopolizes the discourse on it and makes some projections about what the future is going to look like for them, and those projections have real-life implications for them,” he said.

‘We can sell this without challenging their belief’

It’s not as impossible as it sounds, perhaps. One solution could be found in Salisbury, about 45 minutes down the road, where Mayor Jake Day is grappling with how to prepare his city of 35,000 for the effects of climate change.

Salisbury experienced a 1,000-year flood last year, when parts of the city were inundated. Apartment buildings flooded. Day, who has a master’s degree in environmental policy from Oxford University, knows more flooding is coming. Yet he is tasked with running the largest city on the Eastern Shore, a conservative area where about half the residents think humans are causing global warming and only 40 percent think global warming will harm them personally, according to a survey from the Yale University Program on Climate Change Communication.

The national political debate can shrink to irrelevance at the local level, Day said. Political leaders often don’t even have to do much explaining about why they need to make expensive infrastructure upgrades to handle more extreme weather events, because the evidence is usually in front of people, he said. They’ve already seen the evidence. It’s what happens when their houses, and those of their neighbors, get flooded. They’ve seen Main Street inundated.

“It’s always important to take it back to that individual experience and say, ‘Forget the political debate, forget the national debate, forget the debate about the science; think about what you’re seeing right here. You’ve got to do something about it, and you’ve elected us to make decisions; you’ve elected me to make decisions, so I’ve got to do something about it.’ And then when you get into specific projects, it all makes sense to people,” Day said.

People on the Eastern Shore are particularly attuned to the effects of climate change, even if they use different terminologies, because they live between the bay and ocean and recognize how it could alter their livelihood, said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.). The solution to addressing climate change is to develop an energy policy, one centered on lowering carbon emissions and increasing renewable energy and green jobs, he said.

“The way we deal with excessive carbon emissions also helps us with a smart energy policy and with more jobs, so I think we can sell this without challenging their belief on climate or how much we can affect climate by our activities, even though the science is clear on that,” he said. “The policies themselves are popular. I don’t avoid using climate change; I talk about it all the time. But in order to get broader support, we may have to use different ways of presenting it. We never want this to be a partisan issue. It’s not a partisan issue.”

In the meantime, construction of newer—and stronger—homes continues apace.

On a recent day, David Albert lugged a load of wood into the shell of a 1,200-square-foot, three-bedroom house. It’s replacing one damaged by Superstorm Sandy five years ago. To him and others, the job boom is an appealing byproduct of the damaging storm.

“They’re worried about their job more than they’re worried about climate change,"" he said.

87,87,FL-2017-000062-TWN,Wei Zhongxian: When China Yielded to the Terrifying Power of a Notorious Eunuch - Ancient Origins,https://www.ancient-origins.net/history-famous-people/wei-zhongxian-when-china-yielded-terrifying-power-notorious-eunuch-008245,"Wei Zhongxian is often considered to be the most powerful and notorious eunuch in Chinese history. He had powers almost equivalent to that of the emperor’s and those who opposed him were ruthlessly eliminated.

Why Wei Zhongxian Became a Eunuch

Wei Zhongxian (written in Chinese as 魏忠贤) lived between the 16th and 17th centuries, during which China was under the rule of the Ming Dynasty. This eunuch served the Tianqi Emperor, who reigned from 1620 to 1627, and was an extremely influential figure in the late Ming court - the empire was practically ruled by the eunuch.

Wei Zhongxian was born in 1568 in Suning (which is today part of the central Chinese province of Hebei). He first entered into imperial service as a eunuch after voluntarily submitting himself to castration. This decision was made as he was facing bankruptcy as a result of debts incurred from excessive gambling. As a eunuch, Wei Zhongxian first entered into the service of Lady Wang, the mother of Zhu Youjiao (who would later become the Tianqi Emperor). Wei Zhongxian’s devotion to the young prince enabled a strong bond to form between the two individuals. Additionally, the eunuch became acquainted with another figure close to the future emperor, the wet nurse Madame Ke.

Wei Zhongxian Increases His Power

Wei Zhongxian’s opportunity to play a greater role in state affairs came in October 1620. The Taichang Emperor died suddenly in late September, after reigning for less than a month. As a result, his eldest son, Zhu Youjiao, ascended the throne as the Tianqi Emperor. The new emperor, who was 15 years old when he was enthroned, had no interest in running the state. Instead, he preferred to devote his time to carpentry. Additionally, the emperor is recorded to have been illiterate, and was too weak and indecisive to be an effective ruler.

These shortcomings of the Tianqi Emperor as a ruler did not go unnoticed by Wei Zhongxian. The eunuch’s close relationship with the emperor enabled him to take advantage of the situation, thus making him the de facto ruler of the empire. Wei Zhongxian was appointed as the Brush-Holding Director of Ceremonial, as well as the Commissioner of the Three Treasures of Commercial Revenues. In order to strengthen his position in the imperial court, Wei Zhongxian created a faction of court eunuchs. Additionally, those eunuchs faithful to him were given important posts in the palace service.

Wei Zhongxian also exerted his influence on the officials of the imperial court. The majority of these officials decided to throw their support behind the powerful eunuch, either due to fear of retribution, or with the hope that they would be rewarded for their loyalty. Only a small group of officials, known as the Donglin Faction, had the courage to oppose Wei Zhongxian and his supporters. This faction consisted of idealistic Confucian officials who advocated reforms in the government.

Results of the Eunuch’s Reign of Terror

Wei Zhongxian decided to deal with this opposition by eliminating the members of this faction and their supporters around the country. One of the imperial institutions that allowed Wei Zhongxian to carry out these persecutions was the Eastern Depot. This was a spy and secret police agency run by eunuchs that Wei Zhongxian came to control in 1623. As a result, numerous officials were either executed or removed from their offices. In addition, this faction was declared illegal, and their academies closed. Nevertheless, there was resistance in some areas, with supporters of the faction ignoring the imperial edict, and in some cases, even killing those sent by Wei Zhongxian to execute his orders.

Wei Zhongxian’s reign of terror did not last for long. In 1627, the Tianqi Emperor died, and was succeeded by his younger brother, Zhu Youjian, who reigned as the Chongzhen Emperor. Although Wei Zhongxian tendered his resignation, it was declined by the new emperor. In the meantime, there were calls for the eunuch’s impeachment. In the end, the emperor decided to send Wei Zhongxian into exile in Fengyang, Anhui. On the way to Fengyang, the emperor was warned that the eunuch might attempt to stage a rebellion, and ordered the arrest of Wei Zhongxian. When the eunuch received news of his impending arrest, he knew that it was all over, and chose to commit suicide, rather than face trial and possibly execution. Nevertheless, Wei Zhongxian’s corpse was later dismembered, and displayed in his native village as a warning.

88,88,FL-2017-000062-TWN,"To better prepare for drought and flood, India needs an integrated system to map water, air, climate - Scroll.in",https://scroll.in/article/839387/to-better-prepare-for-drought-and-flood-india-needs-an-integrated-system-to-map-water-air-climate,"As the advent of the 2017 summer monsoon over mainland South Asia showed once again, Indian meteorologists have become highly accurate in their forecasts. Gone are those Jerome K Jerome days when you left your umbrella at home if the Meteorological Department predicted rain. Now the weather office can even anticipate a relatively unpredictable phenomenon such as a dust storm in the North Indian summer. It may not be as good for forecasts more than a week in advance, but it’s far better than before.

Farmers all over India – especially those who do not have irrigation facilities – are now using the agricultural meteorology or agrimet service of the India Meteorological Department and they can get crucial information such as rainfall forecast over the next week through text messages on their phones.

The shortcomings

There is a lot that can and should be done to extend the scope of these weather predictions to large-scale hydrological predictions, both short and long term, so that farmers and administrators can plan for the more frequent and more severe floods and droughts that are occurring in South Asia because of climate change.

Information about water flow in rivers is now available through a water resources information system, but that has severe limitations due to regulatory issues – there is no information available to the public about real time water flow in transboundary rivers, thanks to an outdated law. This means there is no real time water flow information available in the public domain from the three largest river basins in the country – those of the Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra. This clearly affects preparations to face floods.

When it comes to drought preparedness, the situation is similar – the information available is better than before but not good enough. The Central Water Commission now puts out in the public domain the water storage status of the 91 largest reservoirs in India and updates this information every week. This list still leaves out far too many water bodies that are crucial in determining if a region will face drought.

The other crucial information needed to anticipate a drought is the status of groundwater, but the latest status available on the website of India’s Central Ground Water Board is dated March 31, 2011. India is a country where over half the irrigation is from groundwater. It is the world’s largest groundwater user.

There is another shortcoming – India does not have enough monitoring stations to map air pollution over the country. Most of the monitoring stations are scattered over a few large cities, though satellites show the most polluted zones to be in and around industrial townships and highways. Improving this observation system is crucial because air pollution – especially through aerosols – affects local and regional weather patterns.

The next frontier

Improving these hydrologic and air quality information systems is essential to manage the crucial food-water-energy nexus in a warming world. This will need integrated observations and predictions, which can be carried out through a Regional Earth System Prediction framework. Regional Earth System Prediction treats land, ocean, atmosphere, ecosystem, agriculture, and human interactions as components of one integrated system. This has to be used with an integrated observation system that provides the data needed to build, validate and verify local and regional weather and long-term climate system models.

Despite some shortcomings, all the pieces are in place to build a Regional Earth System Prediction and integrated observation system for India. The country now has of one of the best instrumental climate data records of a sufficiently long-time series, covering a large-enough area. Empirical forecasts of the monsoon and various hydrologic variables such as stream flows are now advancing to dynamic forecasts. The research work going on at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune now includes extending short term weather forecasts to long term climate predictions.

For information essential to manage the food-energy-water nexus, India needs two steps. The first is to improve its hydrologic and air quality information systems. The second is a national strategy to integrate the weather and climate information with the hydrologic and air quality information and manage this together. Then agricultural scientists can improve what they are doing right now to help farmers plan their crops.

To make such an integrated system useful, scientists also need to estimate the length of time to which forecasts from such an integrated system will be reliable.

There are other important parts of an integrated observation system, such as greenhouse gas emissions, soil moisture, soil health, nutrient and sediment loadings in water bodies etc. New scientific developments are happening all the time – a recent one is an improvement in our understanding of how efficiently plants use photosynthesis to turn sunlight into food. These improvements take place at all levels, from the gene to the landscape. Such developments need to be merged into the integrated observation system. Tracking food, energy and water consumption is also an essential part.

When all these are added up, integrating and managing this information may seem a daunting task, but it can be done. Building this capability is a necessary requirement to safeguard the nation’s future.

89,89,FL-2017-000062-TWN,Paris Isn’t the Only Clean Energy Pact the U.S. Is Fleeing - MIT Technology Review,https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/06/07/68308/paris-isnt-the-only-clean-energy-pact-the-us-is-fleeing/,"Energy ministers from around the world traveled to Beijing this week for a series of meetings on international efforts to accelerate the shift to clean energy, including the Mission Innovation pact aimed at doubling government funding for research and development.

U.S. energy secretary Rick Perry is attending, but the Trump administration has arguably already staged a de facto exit from the initiative, and has certainly signaled it’s opposed to the goals. The meetings occur just days after President Trump announced plans to withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement, and weeks after the White House floated a budget proposal that, far from doubling research funding for the Department of Energy, would slash it by more than $3 billion (see “Exiting Paris, Trump Cedes Global Leadership on Climate Change”).

For some observers, the location and timing of the meetings only reinforce the growing international perception that China has seized the climate leadership role abandoned by the United States.

""This could be a passing of the torch,"" says Varun Sivaram, acting director of the program on energy security and climate change at the Council on Foreign Relations, referring to the Energy Ministerial meetings held Tuesday through Thursday at the China National Convention Center.

Nations pieced together the Mission Innovation pact in 2015, on the sidelines of the Paris climate negotiations, which were focused on emissions reduction goals rather than the technology to get there. Ultimately, 22 countries plus the European Union would sign onto the deal, which sought to “develop and scale breakthrough technologies … to enable the global community to meet our shared climate goals.” China pledged to raise its spending by around $3.8 billion, while the United States committed to increase funding by more than $6 billion by 2021.

Instead, President Trump's fiscal 2018 budget plan slashes spending on energy research, and eliminates two teams in the Office of International Affairs that coordinated partnerships on climate and energy, including the Mission Innovation program.

“It would be felt all across the United States in research universities, national laboratories, and other technology centers that depend on government funding,” said Jonathan Elkind, former assistant secretary of the Office of International Affairs, in an e-mail.

Few think the White House will get anywhere near the level of cuts it has proposed, but equally few believe there will be substantial research funding increases, particularly on the order required to meet the goals of the Mission Innovation pact. The financial commitments were nonbinding, but some fear that if the United States flagrantly abandons its pledges, other participants may too, undermining momentum.

The funding cuts also threaten to undermine the United States’ competiveness on technologies that could prove to be the defining economic force of the decades ahead. Research suggests Mission Innovation funding increases would pay off in the short term as well, with every dollar of clean energy R&D generating $1.60 in additional economic activity, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts and ICF International.

""There's no question in my mind that any cuts, whether they are large or moderate, will harm U.S. economic growth, reduce American energy security, put the United States at a competitive disadvantage, and undermine the nation's ability to reduce greenhouse gases,"" says Kelly Sims Gallagher, professor of energy and environmental policy at the Fletcher School at Tufts University.

Meanwhile, in a joint statement that leaked last week as President Trump was set to withdraw from the Paris deal, China and the European Union committed to “lead the energy transition.” The draft release included pledges to continue investing in clean energy development as well as efforts to help poor nations transition to sustainable sources.

In the end, disputes over trade issues prevented the formal release of a broader communique from the two parties after meetings in Brussels on Friday. But China is clearly signaling it intends to step into the leadership void.

The broader impact of that shift will depend, of course, on how China handles that role. Among other things, the critical criteria will include whether it pushes for stronger or weaker greenhouse gas emissions standards at home and abroad in the years ahead, and how aggressively it prioritizes energy innovation in addition to the incremental improvements that have defined its market success to date in solar and wind, Sivaram says.

There are other differences that could also be crucial, says Josh Freed, vice president for the clean energy program at the centrist think tank Third Way.

“China leading rather than the U.S. detaches climate policy from other core American values, or what has traditionally been core American values, including human rights, democracy and good governance,” he says. “That’s bad for the world.”

As for what happens next with the Mission Innovation pact, Gallagher of Tufts released a report last week recommending that participating nations set performance rather than strictly financial goals, improve collaboration with the private sector, increase data collection and sharing, and prioritize research efforts around areas in most need of improvement, such as energy storage.

Indeed, it will be nearly impossible for the initiative to meet its collective funding goals without major increases from the United States, which made by far the largest pledge, Sivaram and Daniel Sanchez of the Carnegie Institution for Science, noted in an op-ed piece last week. Reframing the metrics of success away from purely financial ones may be necessary to prevent the initiative from unraveling, they argued.","Wed, 07 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT","https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/flagexhaust-7.jpg?resize=1200,600","['states', 'china', 'energy', 'mission', 'goals', 'research', 'fleeing', 'paris', 'clean', 'isnt', 'funding', 'innovation', 'united', 'climate', 'pact']", 
90,90,FL-2017-000062-TWN,"Water Security and U.S. Foreign Policy in India, Pakistan, and the Philippines - New Security Beat",https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2017/06/water-security-u-s-foreign-policy-india-pakistan-philippines/,"In 2012, the U.S. National Intelligence Council judged that within the next 10 years, water problems would be a major contributor to instability in “many” countries that are of interest to the United States. South and Southeast Asia, with its many transboundary river basins, large populations, and geopolitical flashpoints, is one among a number of hotspots where such instability could occur.

To help policymakers understand the implications of water problems for national security, World Wildlife Fund-U.S. is working with global experts to produce a book highlighting water conflicts and U.S. strategic interests. Four experts spoke at the Wilson Center on May 9 about the dynamics at play in India, Pakistan, and the Philippines.

The World Economic Forum’s 2016 risk survey ranked water crisis as the top risk globally in the next decade. Among experts, there is growing concern about water issues and state fragility. “When government fails to provide basic water services, when they fail to protect the people against drought and flood, fail to preserve water resources captured by the elites, there is a potential loss of legitimacy and an opportunity for other parties to exploit those failures and deepen the instabilities,” said Claudia Sadoff, the World Bank’s global lead for water security and integrated resource management.

It is essential and urgent to “design and prioritize water programs that will lead to stability, development, and prosperity,” she said.

India’s Surprising Pivot

India has seen tremendous changes in its political and economic landscape in recent years, said Keith Schneider, senior editor and chief correspondent at the water journalism organization Circle of Blue. He called it a clash of a “20th century development strategy” against the “impediments of 21st century conditions.”

“The earth has been pushing India hard with droughts, floods, typhoons, and extreme weather conditions affecting economies in every part of the country,” said Schneider, who has written about the region extensively for the Wilson Center as part of the joint “Choke Point” series.

In the northern Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, a hydropower push was meant to help solve electricity woes. However, in June 2013, the area was hit by major flooding that may have killed as many as 30,000 people and broke 10 dams as water rushed down narrow mountain valleys, said Schneider. Now large-scale infrastructure plans are being reconsidered.

Of 16 “Ultra-Mega Power Projects,” only 2 are still going forward today

In the northwestern farming states of Punjab and Haryana, free and unlimited access to electricity and water means “the water pumps run all day long which drain the aquifers and produce huge surpluses,” said Schneider. “Half the electricity in Punjab and Haryana is being used to pump water.” As a result, groundwater levels are receding rapidly, while tons of rice sit in storehouses, much of it rotting away before ever being used.

In Chhattisgarh, in eastern India, waterways are being soiled and aquifers depleted to support a push to boost domestic coal mining, even as coal plants are canceled in other areas of the country and as much as 27 percent of generated electricity is lost over transmission lines. In all, of 16 so-called “Ultra-Mega Power Projects” around the country proposed in 2015, immense coal plants that would have produced up to 4,000 megawatts of electricity each, only 2 are still going forward today, said Schneider. In Tamil Nadu, home to one of the canceled plants, a 648-megawatt solar installation was opened last year instead, and other states are making similar moves.

India has understood the changing conditions and is pivoting quickly, if not always perfectly in sync, Schneider said. “They want to develop 225 new gigawatts of new electrical energy in India between now and 2027. It’s the second largest renewable energy source in the world next to China, and it is being driven by drought.”

Overall, global coal production has actually declined in recent years due in no small part to India’s significant changes, he said, and Narendra Modi has emerged as an unlikely leader for economic development and sustainable goals.

Pakistan’s Problems, Inside and Out

Water conditions are also challenging development in next door Pakistan, said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program and senior associate for South Asia at the Wilson Center. What’s more, there is often a national security dynamic to deliberations about water in Islamabad.

Pakistan relies almost exclusively on the Indus River and its tributaries, and the river originates across the border in India. As a result, “there is nothing apolitical about transboundary water management,” Kugelman said.

Strains have mounted as the aquifers in the Indus Basin drain with little or no signs of recharge. Pakistan faces both increasing water scarcity and major incidences of flooding. The country was hit by major floods in 2010, affecting more than 20 million people and an estimated $5 billion damage to the agricultural sector, and again in 2011, 2012, and 2013. The southern coastal city of Karachi, which has long provided opportunities for rural communities, has now become increasingly vulnerable to sea-level rise and stronger storms, causing reverse urban-to-rural migration and concerns about instability and radicalization, said Kugelman.

Meanwhile, Pakistan uses water at a tremendously high rate. The agricultural sector is dominated by elites who practice water guzzling techniques aided by government subsidies, said Kugelman. Poor infrastructure and maintenance, and few waste-water treatment facilities cause further wastage and pollution. Such inefficiency is complemented by a lack of public awareness and general apathy. Traditional power structures help perpetuate inequitable land and water policies, “creating feudal-like conditions,” said Kugelman. Food security has suffered and as of 2016, Pakistan scored a 48 out of 100 on the Global Food Security Index, with 22 percent of its population undernourished.

“It is 100 percent wrong to claim water is a ‘soft’ issue”

The combination of water problems is straining the relationship with India and the long-standing Indus Waters Treaty, governing water allocation between the two states. Contrary to claims made by Pakistan that India is trying to block their water sources, Kugelman said “there has been a fair level of cooperation between these two enemies in managing transboundary water resources.”

“[The Indus Waters Treaty] has long been seen as a success story, as although India and Pakistan have fought a war, they have not fought a war over water,” he said, “At least not yet.”

There are “voices from both sides of the border that have called for the treaty to be renegotiated,” however, and India actually threatened to withdraw after a terrorist attack on a military base in disputed Kashmir last fall.

Kugelman said that though the treaty is certainly being challenged by climate change and population growth in both countries, there is not enough trust and cooperation between the two countries to allow for a renegotiation currently. “Water is deeply intertwined [in] longstanding political disputes between India and Pakistan… It is 100 percent wrong to claim water is a ‘soft’ issue,” he said.

More Than Manila

“There is more to the Philippines than Manila,” said Roger-Mark De Souza, director of population, environmental security, and resilience at the Wilson Center, and there’s more to Mindanao than conflict. While instability in Mindanao, the southern island that has made headlines for a nearly 50-year-long insurgency, has roots in ethnic, religious, and political tensions, water too has played a role.

The Philippines, like Pakistan, is consistently listed among the most climate-vulnerable nations in the world because of its exposure to extreme weather. Since 2006, the archipelago has been blasted by 5 of the 10 strongest storms in its recorded history, including 2013’s devastating Cyclone Haiyan (or Yolanda as it’s known in the Philippines).

Mindanao, normally the nation’s breadbasket, has faced major drought as well, striking the economy hard. In April 2016, thousands of hungry farmers in Cotabato Province sought relief in urban centers, while Zamboanga City has been forced to ration water. Agriculture accounts for more than 48 percent of jobs in Mindanao and contributes 14 percent of the nation’s GDP, said De Souza.

Non-agricultural development has been slow and sometimes controversial. A proposed dam near the Liguasan Marsh is contested because it would flood thousands of acres of existing farmland, drain a marsh claimed as an ancestral homeland by some groups, and – the locals fear – pave the way for oil and gas exploration, said De Souza. Indeed, disputed land and natural resource rights are at the core of Muslim separatist movements on the island.

Conflict with Manila over these and other grievances will continue to play out but could take on a different tone with the election of Rodrigo Duterte as president, the first ever Mindanaoan to hold the office, said De Souza. Though he has professed a strong anti-Western agenda, Duterte also has many reasons to work more closely with the United States on counter terror operations and development programs, especially now as ongoing clashes with Islamist militant groups have forced him to declare martial law in Mindanao for 60 days.

Implications for U.S. Engagement

The three case studies show the complex nature of water management and its effects on society. The United States has ample strategic reason to help the Philippines and other governments adapt to changing conditions, said WWF-US Senior Policy Advisor David Reed. “U.S. prosperity and national security depend directly on the prosperity and stability of its partner countries and competing countries around the world.” He added that with increasing insecurity and ecological change, it will be essential to identify the impact of water policies on human systems that cause social disruptions to head off the worst effects and steer toward positive outcomes.

The panelists suggested improving communication at the local level, making more of an effort to spread messages of conservation to hard-to-reach rural and urban communities through radio, social media, and other mediums.

Additionally, it will be essential to target stakeholders who have the power to make a difference, such as the military in the case of Pakistan, said Kugelman. He also suggested that incorporating water into climate-sensitive policies is especially important, given the resources and attention that climate policies sometimes command.

De Souza proposed that in many cases water programs can be points of entry for investing in both peacebuilding and climate resilience by “recognizing the persistence of conflict, the saliency of natural resources, and the state of underdevelopment.”

“Opportunities must be recognized to link defense, diplomacy, and development efforts particularly in the context of water management,” said De Souza.

HANOI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's capital city of Hanoi is being hit by a prolonged heat wave with the temperature in the downtown reaching 41.5 degrees Celsius, the highest since 1971, the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said Sunday.

After experiencing the temperature of 41.5 degrees Celsius on Saturday, Hanoi will have temperatures of 30-41 degrees Celsius on Sunday, said the center, adding that the heat wave will end on Monday in Vietnam's northern region and on Tuesday in the central region.

The warm phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation, late rainy season in the northern and central regions and climate change are mainly attributed to the ongoing heat wave in Vietnam, according to the center.

Some local people also blamed the presence of too many concrete works and too few trees in urban areas for the heat wave.

The prolonged heat wave plus humidity has sickened many people.

Over the past few days, some hospitals in Hanoi have reported increases of 5-15 percent in numbers of children and elder people who seek treatment for respiratory diseases or stroke.","Sun, 04 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['vietnamese', 'hit', 'hanoi', 'celsius', '46', 'vietnams', 'prolonged', 'heat', 'degrees', 'temperature', 'wave', 'xinhua', 'northern', 'hottest', 'capital']",

BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Two large machines are buzzing and emitting a slight odor of fermentation inside the kitchen waste disposal room. The 40-square-meter room is in the corner of a residential district in Beijing's Xicheng district.

Food scraps from more than 2,100 households and a canteen are ""swallowed"" by these two machines and undergo deep processing.

Sun Chunming, of the property service center, says each machine can dispose of 500 kilograms of kitchen waste a day. The machine grinds the food scraps and through a proprietary microbial process, 70 percent of the waste is converted into water, carbon dioxide and organic solids that can be further refined into fertilizer.

""Together the two machines can produce around 1,000 kilograms of fertilizer a day and the fertilizer is applied to nearby green spaces,"" Sun says.

The on-site process is used in more than 30 canteens in China's central government agencies, municipal commissions, and some schools in Beijing. Lin Jinwen, an official from Beijing Municipal Commission of Urban Management, says 128 canteens in government agencies are receiving subsidies to install this disposal equipment.

However, it is hard to spread the on-site kitchen waste treatment to restaurants and catering businesses as they are unwilling to pay for these equipment.

CHINA'S CHALLENGE

Liu Jianguo, professor of the School of Environment at Tsinghua University, says the disposal of kitchen waste is a challenge with Chinese characteristics. China has a long-established food culture and sophisticated cooking styles. The nature of food scraps is different from that in other countries as they contain more oil and salt. They cannot easily be incinerated like other garbage and will pollute underground water if they are sent directly to landfills.

""In Japan and some other countries, restaurants have to bear the cost of food waste disposal. However in China, restaurants do not have to pay,"" Liu says.

China's growing food consumption has brought a rapid growth in food waste.

In Beijing and other big cities that boost thriving catering business, the problem is particularly serious.

According to the Beijing Municipal Commission of City Management, about 2,600 tonnes of kitchen waste is produced by more than 40,000 restaurants and dining halls of institutions and schools every day and the amount is expected to reach 2,900 tonnes in 2020. However, the city's 10 food waste treatment centers, together with on-site treatment equipment, can handle only 2,000 tons per day.

FILLING THE ""GAP""

China has been encouraging food waste recycling. In January, the National Development and Reform Commission issued the ""Strategic Emerging Industry Key Product and Service Guidance Catalog"" (2016), and kitchen waste disposal was included in the ""resources recycling industry.""

Beijing is building five new processing centers in Haidian, Fengtai and Shunyi districts. They are expected to be in use at the end of the year and then Beijing's processing capacity is expected to reach 2,800 tonnes per day.

Nangong in Daxing district is one of Beijing's kitchen waste disposal centers, with a daily capacity of 400 tonnes. Every day, specially-designed trucks go to designated restaurants and canteens to collect food waste and take it to the center.

The waste first goes into a solid-liquid separator. The solid material enters the composting system, and the liquid enters the leachate treatment plant.

Zhang Yang, manager of the Nangong center, says composting is a mature method of disposal, and has to some extent guaranteed the harmless treatment and reuse of kitchen waste.

But he adds that the fertilizer derived from kitchen waste has limited sales channels and low market recognition. The output return is much lower than the processing cost, so food waste disposal still needs a subsidy.

The kitchen waste collected from restaurants is not purely food scraps. It is mixed with disposable chopsticks, rags and even glass bottles and other debris, which is a headache for Zhang.

""The non-kitchen waste sometimes damages our disposal equipment. Moreover, it has greatly lowered the quality of kitchen waste, increasing the difficulty of pre-treatment and affecting the quality of fertilizer extracted,"" Zhang says.

""We are responsible for handling kitchen waste, but we have no right to supervise the garbage classification of restaurants. We hope the authorities can take coercive measures on that.""

GARBAGE SORTING

In March, China's State Council issued a plan requiring 46 cities to carry out mandatory garbage sorting by the end of 2020. Under the plan, all public institutions and companies are required to separate hazardous waste, kitchen waste and recyclable materials.

Beijing's Tongzhou District, the capital city's sub-center, will implement mandatory garbage sorting in public institutions and more than 500 restaurants by the end of this year.

Every day at 9 a.m., staff at Tongzhou Zhenchongqing Restaurant put the special green kitchen waste bin full of food leftovers out for the sanitation companies to collect.

""A napkin, a chopstick - even a toothpick - cannot be mixed into the kitchen waste,"" restaurant lobby manager Wang Liang says. ""Once the recyclers find other garbage included, they ask us to take it out.""

Liu Jianguo says the implementation of garbage sorting will be complex, requiring legal support and improved regulations. He hopes to see more detailed policies and regulations on kitchen waste disposal.

""The management of kitchen waste involves a number of government departments and needs a coordinated approach. How to ensure the classification of kitchen waste; how to dispose of kitchen waste more effectively -- these all test a city's management.""","Wed, 14 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",,"['garbage', 'tonnes', 'scraps', 'treatment', 'kitchen', 'waste', 'disposal', 'food', 'xinhua', 'day', 'grapples', 'beijing', 'restaurants', 'insight']", 
95,95,FL-2017-000062-TWN,Chinese Companies Move Deeper Into Shadow Banking - Fox Business,https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/chinese-companies-move-deeper-into-shadow-banking,"China's crackdown on debt is driving some companies to a murkier form of financing as it gets harder to secure bank loans or tap the bond market.

New loans from so-called trusts, firms that raise money from individuals and corporations to plow into riskier areas of the economy, reached 882.3 billion yuan ($128.6 billion) in the first four months of this year, according to data from the People's Bank of China, nearly five times as much as the same period in 2016.

Trust firms, which often charge borrowers higher rates than banks, occupy a middle ground between banking and asset management. They are licensed and loosely regulated by China's banking watchdog, but they lack some of banks' protections, such as government deposit insurance, and they have more flexibility to invest in risky areas than banks do.

For companies, trusts represent the next best thing as bank loans or bond financing dry up or become more expensive.

Government-owned Qingzhou City Construction and Investment Co., in the eastern city of Qingzhou, received permission to issue bonds last year. But with rising yields on corporate debt, it has turned to a trust firm instead, according to people familiar with the matter.

Daye Trust Co. is helping Qingzhou City Construction raise 200 million yuan through a two-year product that offers investors returns of 6.5% a year. The firm would pay Daye a rate of about 8%, which is still less than it was expecting to pay for bonds, these people say. Qingzhou City Construction intends to use the proceeds to finance a water-treatment project.

One area of concern for authorities as they tackle soaring Chinese debt -- a factor in Moody's Investors Service's downgrade of China's sovereign debt last week -- is loans that banks disguise as investments. A shift to trust lending would make it even harder to gauge the true extent of credit in the system.

""Regulation of the trust sector has been much more ad hoc"" compared with that of the formal banking sector, says George Xu, a Moody's credit analyst. As a result, ""trust firms can hide where they're investing.""

China's banking regulator declined to comment on the rise in trust loans.

Actions by China's central bank and banking regulator to raise short-term funding costs and rein in banks' hidden loans have made banks increasingly reluctant to lend.

China Zheshang Bank Co., a midsize lender that had grown with the help of off-book loans and aggressive lending tactics, said that it would step up scrutiny of borrowers, turning down property developers in cities with unsold housing and businesses in ""outdated industries.""

The regulatory storm has roiled Chinese markets, sending bond yields to the highest levels in two years, as banks sell down their bondholdings to boost liquidity. Higher yields are a burden for companies, many of which have canceled bond-issuance plans.

The market stress has made Beijing wary it is moving too fast. According to people familiar with the matter, the central bank and the banking, securities and insurance watchdogs have held meetings in recent days to discuss how to tackle the debt problem at a more measured pace.

Authorities continue to give trusts more leeway than banks to invest in risky projects, including property, steel and other sectors, where authorities have tried to dial back borrowing.

Shanxi Trust Co. in northern China said it issued the sixth iteration of a trust product for a local construction company in April, with the aim of raising 50 million yuan. The borrower had been working with the trust firm for the past few years, according to Liang Lu, a project manager at Shanxi Trust, who said its customers don't typically include companies that can get bank loans.

Trusts loans have surged at times in the past, amid regulator tolerance and high demand for credit from companies when the economy was booming. A record surge in the first four months of 2013 led regulators to crack down on the sector. Two years later, trusts helped investors leverage bets to buy stocks, which contributed to a flood of borrowing that culminated in a market crash that summer.

At the end of 2016, trust loans made up 10% of China's total so-called shadow-banking system, or lending outside regular bank loans and bond markets, according to Moody's. Trust loans accounted for 15% of total shadow banking as of the end of 2013. Moody's says the decline in share was mainly because high-yielding investment products from banks, another kind of shadow lending, grew faster.

Even companies with access to formal banking channels and the capital markets are turning to shadow banks.

""It takes time to issue bonds,"" said Eva Lau, investor-relations manager at Shimao Property Holdings Ltd., one of China's largest property developers. The Hong Kong-listed firm got central bank approval to issue notes in the interbank market, but in anticipation of a lengthy process, it turned to Xiamen Trust Co., which is helping Shimao Property raise 1 billion yuan.

The company still plans to issue bonds and expects to pay yields of up to 4.5% on the later bond sale, said Ms. Lau. By comparison, borrowing from nonbank financial institutions, including trusts, came at 5.7% interest rates in 2016, compared with 5.3% from banks issuing yuan loans, according to Shimao's latest 2016 financial report.

Ms. Lau said Shimao turned to Xiamen to diversify funding channels and said that the recent regulatory tightening wasn't a factor. The company doesn't detail its funding sources; Ms. Lau said trust financing is a tiny portion of the firm's total financing.

Back in Qingzhou, one person familiar with Qingzhou City Construction and Investment said the company's strong government backing means it doesn't have to pay as much as a private company for trust financing.

The firm has yet to tap the bond market.

97,97,FL-2017-000062-TWN,Nidec invests for sevenfold boost in robot parts production - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Nidec-invests-for-sevenfold-boost-in-robot-parts-production,"OSAKA -- Japanese electric motor manufacturer Nidec plans a sevenfold increase in production capacity for a key part used in industrial robots, as growing demand for those machines due to labor shortages proves a boon for related industries as well.

Nidec will invest 4 billion yen ($36.2 million) in equipment for subsidiary Nidec-Shimpo's factory to increase the production of speed reducers, a core component in robots. Demand for this component is expected to reach 2.72 million units in 2025, roughly double the amount estimated for 2017.

Speed reducers control robotic limbs and give them power. Nidec-Shimpo has been in the industry since 2015, preceded by companies like Harmonic Drive Systems and Nabtesco.

The Nidec subsidiary previously produced 5,000 units monthly. But a flood of inquiries from robot makers drove the manufacturer to raise monthly capacity to 10,000 units in May, with further plans to reach 20,000 units next March and 35,000 as of April 2018.

Yet labor shortages also pose hurdles for Nidec-Shimpo. The company will limit staffing needs by automating the new equipment, including for transport and testing. Productivity and processing speed are both expected to double. Nidec-Shimpo holds a market share of just 5% but aims to reach 30% with the production increase.

Nidec is diversifying its business through acquisitions, expanding from its mainstay of precision motors for hard disk drives to areas such as large motors for home electronic appliances and robots. Nidec-Shimpo also is expanding through acquisitions such as the purchase of a Spanish company.

Other makers of speed reducers are feeling the windfall from rising demand for industrial robots. Sumitomo Heavy Industries improved sales of the component for robots by about 20% in the two years through fiscal 2016.

Sumitomo Heavy's reducer-gear sales total about 100 billion yen, with orders for industrial robots making up around 10%. The company has nearly reached capacity at its manufacturing center in Nagoya and both factories in Germany.

Harmonic Drive Systems received 8.65 billion yen in speed reducer orders for industrial robots in the January-March period, more than double the amount from the previous quarter. The company added production lines and established a two-shift system but cannot match demand. The parts manufacturer also plans to build a new factory in the Nagano Prefecture city of Matsumoto.

But the streets were quieter than usual, and while those out and about were clearly determined to get on with their plans, there was a sense of edginess.

Saturday night, horror came to London Bridge : three terrorists rammed a van into people walking across London Bridge, before leaping out and attacking drinkers and diners with knives at Borough Market, a popular spot full of bars and restaurants.

Southwark Bridge and the South Bank, a short distance from Borough Market, felt unusually quiet at Sunday lunchtime.

The few tourists milling around paused to look out over the Thames towards the scene of the previous night's attack. Police in yellow high-visibility jackets paced back and forth, offering people directions to avoid the cordoned-off area.

Some, though, were defiant.

Christine Yang and Mario Yuan came from China to take their wedding photographs in London.

Bride and groom Christine Yang and Mario Yuan, both 26, came all the way from Guangdong, China, to take their wedding photographs in front of London's iconic landmarks.

Standing on the Millennium Bridge, with St Paul's Cathedral behind them, Yang said that after studying in London for two years the city had special meaning to her.

And she was determined not let the terror incident stop her plans: ""I heard about it but I don't worry about it. I still believe the U.K. Is safer than China. I just wanted to make some memories here.""

Kristina Simons, 47, a teacher from Greenwich, was walking across the mostly-deserted Southwark Bridge on Sunday morning, heading to a yoga class.

""My first thought when I woke up this morning was not to go into the city today,"" she admitted. ""It's hard to verbalize that feeling.""

Simons, who grew up in London, said the city had felt reasonably secure until recently. ""We've had a few safe years when we haven't had to think about it. It is worrying. It makes you feel unsafe.""

But she sounded a note of resilience, insisting that Londoners must not give in to terrorists: ""I was on a big night out on the South Bank drinking with my friends recently and I didn't even think about it ... You have to carry on.""

A couple on the beach by the River Thames. Many tourists and locals were going about their everyday business undaunted.

Stephanie Graff, 42, from Lyon in France, held hands with her eight- and 10-year-old sons as they looked out over the river from Southwark Bridge. Graff, who was visiting London for the weekend, said she'd be happy to head home on Monday.

""Because of the kids, I don't tell them what's going on. I don't want them to be scared. I just tell them that there are many police out keeping people safe.""

After a spate of similar attacks in France, she says this is not a new dilemma: ""I explain the sadness, but I don't want them to be afraid. You need to keep living.""

Ildiko Papp, 49, her husband Alejandro, 58, and daughter Cristina, 16, arrived in London on Friday with a tour group from Hungary. On Sunday their guide was stopped short at the cordon set up outside The Anchor pub, just around the corner from Borough Market.

""We were a bit worried after Manchester, but we thought OK we won't cancel our trip, the same thing won't happen in the same place twice. But this attack has overwritten that rule as well,"" she says. ""We no longer have reference points of what to expect, but that won't stop us.""

""I've been able to make a couple of people smile but it is a lot quieter,"" said Ian Thom, who makes balloon animals for passersby.

Ian Thom, 65, a Scot who has lived in London most of his life, spends his Saturdays and Sundays on the South Bank making balloon animals for passersby.

""I'm part of the ambiance here,"" he said. ""I've been able to make a couple of people smile today but it is a lot quieter -- there should be a lot more people out on a day like today.""

""It's not going to stop any of us though. I feel annoyed and angry that they've dared to disturb the harmony here, but it's a temporary thing.""

""We'll just get on with it,"" he insisted, adding: ""We've survived bigger and far worse.""

Street performers, rickshaw drivers, cabbies, and others who make up the fabric of the South Bank echoed Thom, saying that far fewer people were out and about than usual.

""People are walking around the city like zombies,"" said black cab driver Danny Hussey.

Hussey, who has worked as a cabbie for 17 years, said he was on Westminster Bridge when another attack unfolded in March.

""It's gone really bad here,"" Hussey said, adding that traffic was down about 70% from an average Sunday.

Danny Hussey has worked as a black cab driver for 17 years. He said traffic has dropped recently.

Geani Cosdea, a 36-year-old rickshaw driver from Romania, was parked on Westminster Bridge on Sunday afternoon. He said he has also noticed a marked drop in tourists since the March attack.

""Working here every day on the bridge, I can see that since the Westminster attack there are a lot less tourists,"" Cosdea says.

But the attack did not deter tourist Daniel Almgren, 43, from Stockholm, Sweden. Almgren was with his 11-year-old daughter Lo at Bank Station on Saturday night when the attack happened.

""We were sort of locked in -- hundreds of people were running around saying that there had been an attack,"" he recalled. ""We rushed onto the last DLR train. It was only at midnight that I got cell service and found out what was going on.""

""There was just a similar attack in Stockholm, where we live. My wife was actually very near to that attack at a café,"" he said. ""We had a lot of discussions after that and this morning again. I don't want (Lo) to think this is stuff that happens regularly.""

""This is her first time in London and I had to explain to her that this not regular,"" he added. ""We will try not to let this change our plans and change our mood. The best thing to do is not to change our ways.""

Visitors flood into a performance of Romeo and Juliet at the Globe Theater on London's South Bank.

Friends Daniel Leadbitter, 20, and Ellie Harrier, also 20, were among hundreds queuing outside Shakespeare's Globe theater on Sunday afternoon.

""The best thing about London is that it doesn't ever find itself defined by its downfalls,"" said Harrier. ""We acknowledge we are a flawed population and we move on.""

But Leadbitter said it was important not to give in to the terrorists.

""Can't stop yourself from doing things just because of incidents like last night,"" he insisted. ""We're going to see Romeo and Juliet, a play about love. That's what this city needs right now, love.""","Tue, 06 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170604130314-02-london-attack-mood-0604-super-tease.jpg,"['terror', 'attack', 'bridge', 'bank', 'going', 'south', 'dont', 'city', 'tourists', 'fear', 'lot', 'night', 'defiance', 'love', 'london']",
