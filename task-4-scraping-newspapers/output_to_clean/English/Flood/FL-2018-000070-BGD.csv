Over 31,000 of the camps’ one million refugees, who fled Myanmar, are still living in areas considered to be at high risk of deadly flooding and landslides.

Within 24 hours of the rains starting, humanitarian agencies reported some 59 incidents, including landslides, water logging, extreme wind and lightning strikes. The incidents are being mapped and shared on an interagency communal incident overview platform. Over the same period aid agencies reported that over 9,000 people were affected and that this number will increase as the rains continue.

IOM, the UN Migration Agency, is working against the clock to secure infrastructure, including road access and drainage, and to improve preparedness. Working with partners, it is ensuring that refugees continue to receive lifesaving assistance, including water, sanitation and hygiene, health, protection and shelter support during the monsoon.

The risks remains huge, given the vast size and nature of the congested, makeshift camps. The hilly terrain is now largely bare of vegetation and the rains have made the soil extremely unstable, increasing the risk of large scale flooding and landslides.

IOM and its partners have responded by relocating thousands of vulnerable households to safer ground ahead of the rains. Since January, 5,196 households (about 25,000 individuals) vulnerable to landslides and floods or in areas of communal infrastructure construction have been moved to safer areas. Before the end of June, IOM and its partners plan to move another 1,602 vulnerable households (7,248 individuals) to safer ground.

In Unchiprang, a camp in Teknaf sub-district, IOM moved 787 households ahead of the heavy rains. But another 65 households remain at risk of landslides and floods. “Yesterday 19 households were identified as at risk of landslides and moved to learning centers and child friendly spaces of the camp. They’ll be relocated to a new land once the rain stops. Relocation of these families is not possible as their shelters can’t be properly constructed amid continuous heavy rains,” said IOM site manager Mohammed Manun.

""The situation in the camps is growing more desperate with every drop of rain that falls,"" said Manuel Pereira, IOM's Emergency Coordinator in Cox's Bazar. ""You have close to one million people living on hilly, muddy terrain with no trees or shrubs left to hold the ground in place. People and their makeshift shelters are being washed away in the rains. We are racing to save lives, but we urgently need more funding to maintain and expand key humanitarian support during these rains. Without this, our operations, which are currently only 22 percent funded, will run out of money by the end of this month,"" he added.

IOM, WFP and UNHCR have also strategically positioned heavy machinery in key camp locations for disaster response operations in a joint project called the Site Maintenance Engineering Project (SMEP.) Teams are also continuously working to increase available land for relocations. IOM has already prepared 186.8 acres of new land to relocate at least 7,000 people.

Existing refugee shelters have also been upgraded to better withstand heavy rain and high winds, and refugees have been advised on measures they can take to reduce their vulnerability to any upcoming disaster.

Key shelter and non-food items have been stockpiled to ensure sufficient provision during times of high demand. Mobile medical teams will also ensure that displaced and hard to reach populations have uninterrupted access to healthcare.

Access to clean water also poses a huge challenge during the monsoon and IOM and its partners have worked to improve water and hygiene infrastructure, as well as pre-positioning acute watery diarrhea kits and aquatabs in remote areas to meet basic needs.

Half of those threatened by the rising waters and requiring relocation are children.

The first rain of the season poured over the Cox’s Bazar camps and informal settlements last week, inundating most roads. One child reportedly died in a landslide, according to a statement from the U.N. Children’s Fund (UNICEF).

UNICEF estimates 900 shelters and 200 latrines were either damaged or destroyed.

That toll is only expected to grow as the next few months of torrential rains and high winds lash into the tent city, which is precariously perched on landslide-prone hills denuded of trees or in flood-prone lowlands. After peak monsoon season subsides in August, cyclone season begins.

Over 700,000 Muslim Rohingya have sought refuge in Bangladesh after the Myanmar military retaliated against alleged insurgent attacks last August, in an operation a U.N. rights investigator described as having “all the hallmarks of genocide.” These refugees joined 213,000 others who arrived in earlier waves of displacement.

Already uprooted and traumatized, the families are now “defenseless against the elements,” according to UNICEF.

“Thousands of children and their families are living in shelters on hilly areas with no trees, rocks or shrubs to hold sandy ground — much of which has now turned into mud — as the rains continue and the water table rises rapidly,” said Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF representative in Bangladesh. “It’s vital that refugees in the most vulnerable locations are able to move to safer locations, but many families – who have already faced upheavals several times over the last few months – are reluctant to abandon their makeshift homes.”

In addition to the dangers of landslides and flash flooding, monsoon season also brings the risks of waterborne diseases, such as cholera and diarrhea.

To mitigate the damage caused to shelters built of little more than bamboo, UNICEF said it is working to shore up supplies of corrugated iron paneling and tarpaulins.

Dhaka, June 13 (UNI) Following heavy rain and onrush of water from the hills, rising water levels of a number of rivers in several districts around the Bangladesh have left people marooned after damaging protection dams and flooding the areas.

Thousands of people have also been marooned in many areas of the hill districts of Chittagong, as they went underwater after incessant downpour and flash-floods.

In Moulvibazar district, Persistent rain and steady onrush of hill waters have raised the water levels of Monu River in Sharifpur of Kulaura upazila by 175 cm above the danger level.

Local journalist and resident of Hajipur area in Kulaura Saiful Alam said, 'Due to incessant rain for the last three days, the water levels of Monu and Dholai rivers have increased dangerously since the early hours of Tuesday.

'Locals are trying to stop the water flow by using makeshift dams,' said Saiful. 'The waters in Monu River

near the Monu railway bridge and station in Hazipur union are flowing over the danger level. The dams in Matabpur, Madanagar, Chak Ranchap, Hashimpur, Baroigao, and Mondira are in risky situations.'

Since Tuesday afternoon, the dams around Chak Ranchap, Madanagar, and Nischintapur, Chatla Bridge, Chanpur, Amtola BGB camp area, and Datta village of Sharifpur union stand at risk of breaking down.

Local mosques are using loudspeakers to ask aid for the locals, while the locals are trying their best to reinforce the dams.

On the other hand, the water levels of Dholai River in Kamalganj upazila have also increased above danger level, causing floods in localities and croplands. As a result, parts of the dam in nine places in Dholai River, including Madhabpur of Kamalganj upazila, Islampur in Kamalganj Sadar, and Adampur union, are now at risk of being overflowed.

Water Development Board Inspector Abdul Awal said, 'The waters of Dholai River are flowing 25 cm over the danger level. The rate at which rainfall is going on, the waters might increase further.'

In Karimpur upazila village of ward no 1 of Kamalganj municipality, waters have entered localities and croplands by shattering the dams. The water level is still on the rise.

Mayor of Kamalganj municipality Md Jewel Aham said, 'Over 200 people have become trapped inside the village due to Dholai river erosion.'

A 100-foot area in the Dholai River dam was eroded due to constant rainfall in Surandpur village of Munshibazar union in Kamalganj upazila. As a result, 250 families in Surandpur village have become trapped inside. In total, around 500 families have become trapped in Karimpur and Surandpur villages in Kamalganj.

Due to water entering through two eroded parts of the Dholai River dam, the streets of Karimpur and Surandpur have become submerged under 2-3 ft of water.

Kamalganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Md Mahmudul Haque and Mayor of Kamalganj municipality Md Jewel Ahmed have inspected the areas around Surandpur and Karimpur, where the dams have been damaged most seriously.

Ranendra Sankar Chakrabarty of Water Development Board in Moulvibazar said, 'The dams in three places have eroded due to the overflow of Monu River. The waters are increasing due to flooding, and might increase further. Everything is in a risky position,'said Ranendra.

'The flood water this year is greater than last year. On Tuesday, water flowed 80 centimetres above the danger level in the Monu River.'

He added that without any government allocation, he had personally renovated the dams in Monu and Dholai Rivers by spending more than Tk8 crore in the past.

Meanwhile in Habiganj district, the water levels of Khoai River besides Habiganj town have increased by 170 cm on Tuesday due to torrential rain in hills in Tripura province of India.

As a result, the villages around Habiganj town are at risk of flooding.

Alarmed villagers have been keeping a keen eye on the dam in Khoai River so no leakages occur at any place.

Habiganj Water Development Board Executive engineer Tawhidul Islam said, 'The waters in Khoai River have been flowing 170 centimetres above the danger level since 0930 hrs on Wednesday. The water level would have decreased if the overflow from Tripura province was dampened,' said Tawhidul.

'Right at this moment, Habiganj town dwellers are at risk.' Mr Tawhidul informed that to fight the overflow of water, Water Development Board has additional sacks of sand in stock. 'We are paying attention so that we can take immediate measures if leakages are found at any place in the dam,' he added.

However, he said the water level may decrease by afternoon.

In Feni district, parts of the dam in eight places around Muhuri River have broken due to heavy and torrential rain in India, causing streets, croplands, homes, and fisheries to be submerged under water in Parshuram and Fulgazi upazilas. Due to waters flowing three centimeters above danger level, the parts of the dam broke in these areas.

Kohinoor Alam, executive engineer of Feni Water Development Board, said 'Two parts of the dam in Chitholia union of Parshuram upazila, and parts of dam in eight places in North Daulatpur of Fulgazi Sadar upazila, Dhanimurar, Bairoya, and Banik para broke down.'

He said the work for reinforcing the dams at these places could not proceed due to the heavy water flow. The Water Development Board is working to find out the number of villages that have submerged under water, said Mr Kohinoor.

Meanwhile, the goods in shops in Fulgazi bazar have been damaged due to water entering the shops, while streets in Parshuram have gone under water as well.

In Rangamati hilli district, at least 14 villages in Baghaichhari upazila were submerged due to rain and onrush of hill water for the last three days, rendering 60,000 people marooned, according to local administration.

Torrential rain flooded different villages including Karengatoli, Baghaihat, Bangaltoli, Rupkari, Kadamtoli, Tulaban, Gucchagram, Muslim Block, Imam Para, Master Para, Gunia Para, Sarkar Para, College Para and Old Marishya.

A vast area of cropland went under floodwaters, forcing people to take shelter in nearby schools, colleges and madrasas. Besides, the water level of Kaptai Lake was flowing over the danger mark, inundating low-lying areas of the upazila, including Longdu, Jurachhari, Barkal, Bilaichhari and Naniarchar.

AKM Mamunur Rashid, deputy commissioner of Rangamati, said several villages were flooded as the water level in the Kachalong River rose following the rain. Several shelters were opened for the flood-affected people, and around 10 tons of rice was distributed among them, he said.

In Khagrachhari hilli district, the flooding situation has not yet returned to normal.

Several hundred houses and businesses were flooded, as water levels in the Chengi and Maini rivers rose on Monday, following rain.

Md Rashedul Islam, deputy commissioner in the district, said they had already taken necessary preparations to shelter vulnerable families during any natural calamities.

4,4,FL-2018-000070-BGD,Bangladesh Landslide Disaster Summary Sheet - 5 June 2018 - Bangladesh - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/bangladesh-landslide-disaster-summary-sheet-5-june-2018,"Landslides are caused by a combination of natural factors (heavy rainfall, cyclones, flooding), and man-made factors. In Bangladesh, landslides are mostly triggered by heavy rainfall, usually during June. However, the underlying causes of landslide include deforestation, hill cutting, and unregulated development work. Moreover, poverty and landlessness force poor people to live in risky hill-slopes (Natl Plan 2010-2015). All of these factors not only cause landslides but also contribute to the exacerbation of their impact.

Landslides are a regular geologic hazard in southeastern Bangladesh, notably in Chittagong Division (Bandarban, Chittagong, Cox’s Bazar, Khagrachhari, and Rangamati Districts), the part of the country with the highest average slope gradients (see figure 1).

Rapid urbanization has driven hill-cutting activities, deforestation, and construction in Chittagong Division, leading to an increasing number and impact of landslides.

Particularly, the influx of Rohingya taking refuge within camps in Cox’s Bazar is contributing to deforestation and hill-cutting at an alarming rate. Though, Cox’s Bazar previously had relatively low impact of landslides, the risk is becoming increasingly higher since 2010.

Rainfall patterns in Bangladesh have also changed in recent years, with short periods of intense rainfall becoming common. These are more likely to induce landslides on unstable slopes, such as those in Chittagong (Landslide Forum 2008).

Humanitarian and Operational constraints

In addition to their immediate impact, landslides often hinder access to people affected by other humanitarian crises. Communities living in mountainous terrain such as in Khagrachhari, Rangamati and Bandarban, where landslides are common and road or river transport options are limited, are particularly at risk of being cut off by landslides.

There are bureaucratic challenges, as there is hesitation from the government regarding direct cash transfer in the CHT area, due to political (terrorist) concerns. Additionally, there may be security concerns for foreign. As a result, it may be difficult to obtain permissions to work in the CHT.","Tue, 05 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1355813-Start%20Fund%20Bangladesh%20Landslide%20Disaster%20Summary%20Sheet.png?itok=y9dJVAw-,"['factors', 'landslide', 'deforestation', 'bazar', 'work', 'summary', '2018', 'chittagong', 'disaster', 'coxs', 'bangladesh', 'rainfall', 'impact', 'sheet', 'landslides']",

The heavy rain brought flooding and landslides – with reports of one young child killed in a landslide – whilst strong winds damaged or destroyed hundreds of shelters, leaving vulnerable families defenseless against the elements.

“Thousands of children and their families are living in shelters on hilly areas with no trees, rocks or shrubs to hold sandy ground – much of which has now turned into mud - as the rains continue and the water table rises rapidly,” said Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF Representative in Bangladesh. “It’s vital that refugees in the most vulnerable locations are able to move to safer locations, but many families – who have already faced upheavals several times over the last few months -- are reluctant to abandon their makeshift homes.”

UNICEF and partners estimate that 200,000 Rohingya refugees – over 50 per cent children -- are currently threatened by the dual-dangers of flooding and landslides, with 25,000 at highest risk.

A rapid assessment following the latest rains found that of the almost 10,000 refugees directly affected, over 65 per cent were affected by wind, more than one-in-four (27 per cent) by land-slides, and 4 per cent suffered from severe water-logging or flooding.

In addition, it is estimated almost 900 shelters, 15 water points, over 200 latrines, two UNICEF-supported health facilities and two food distribution sites have been damaged or destroyed in the camps, with assessments ongoing, creating additional challenges for the affected population. Rehabilitation efforts are underway.

Most roads leading to the camps have been flooded, while the main military road that bisects the biggest settlement has been shut to all except medical vehicles.

Several learning centres and Child and Women Friendly Spaces run by UNICEF and its partners have been temporarily closed because of the bad weather, affecting thousands of women and children.

The arrival of the monsoon rain also increases health risks within the camps, particularly water borne diseases such as acute watery diarrhea and cholera.

“As the monsoon rains intensify, so do the dangers that children face – not only injury, separation or even death as a result of landslides and flooding, but also disease, and a lack of access to vital services including health and education,” added Beigbeder. “Urgent support is needed to avert further catastrophe for thousands of children.”

More than two and a half metres of rain are expected to fall in Cox’s Bazar throughout June, July and August during peak monsoon season, with more rains forecast to fall later this week.

Over the past few months UNICEF and partners have been working to mitigate the risk of the monsoon rains, including pre-positioning humanitarian supplies – including tarpaulins and corrugated iron panelling -- to be mobilized as required.","Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.unicef.org/sites/default/files/styles/hero_desktop/public/20180614_Rohingya_Monsoon_PR.jpg?itok=OZIiweS2,"['thousands', 'children', 'refugee', 'hit', 'cent', 'rain', 'water', 'rohingya', 'unicef', 'raising', 'powerful', 'health', 'camps', 'rains', 'risks', 'monsoon', 'landslides']",

The results suggest coastal development and climate change, both of which are known to be destroying the world’s coral, could have the knock on effect of subjecting people to more floods.

Reefs serve as natural breakwaters that reduce flooding by dampening waves and breaking them early.

However, their capacity to do this is severely hampered if the corals that form them are degraded, and in a study published in the journal Nature Communications scientists predicted the flooding outcomes if the top one metre of coral reef is lost.

Overall, the scientists predicted annual damages from flooding will double if these trends continue – an increase of $4bn (£3bn).

Island nations like Indonesia, Philippines and Cuba have the most to gain from reef management, with annual expected flood savings exceeding $400m each.

“We built the best global coastal flooding model and then we added reefs to estimate flood risk overall and the benefits provided by these habitats,” said Professor Íñigo Losada, from the University of Cantabria.

“This represents the first global application of a coastal protection model that probabilistically estimates risk and the benefits of coastal ecosystems.”

If coupled with sea level rise, the scientists found that flooding in the absence of coral would likely quadruple.

“Unfortunately, we are already losing the height and complexity of shallow reefs around the world, so we are likely already seeing increases in flood damages along many tropical coastlines,"" said Dr Michael Beck, lead marine scientist at The Nature Conservancy.

“Our national economies are normally only valued by how much we take from nature.

“For the first time, we can now value what every national economy gains in flood savings by conserving its coral reefs every year.”

✕ Extent of hurricane damage to coral reefs revealed by scientists

Coral bleaching events caused by global warming have led to massive “die-offs” in recent years on the Great Barrier Reef.

Globally, the threat posed by climate change is compounded by growing human threats such as coastal development, sand and coral mining, and destructive fishing practices.

The study suggests that tropical storms that have devastated coastlines in recent years such as Hurricanes Irma and Maria and Typhoon Haiyan would have been far worse in the absence of coral reefs acting as buffers.

“Coral reefs are living ecosystems that can recover if they are well managed, and this study identifies why and where we should find the needed support for restoration and management,” said Dr Beck.

“It is our hope that this science will lead to action and greater stewardship of reefs around the world.”

The researchers said their findings should offer a financial incentive to world governments to invest in coral reef conservation in order to prevent future storm damage.

“These estimates make a compelling case for present-day spending on reef management without assuming that reefs will disappear altogether under a business as usual scenario - nor do they rely on just rare, large storms,” said Dr Borja Reguero, a researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

“Better valuations of the benefits provided by coastal habitats like coral reefs, provided in terms familiar to decision makers, can help decision makers recognise the value and ensure the protection of these critical habitats and their services.”","Tue, 12 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/12/17/flood-wave.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['flood', 'scientists', 'change', 'double', 'damage', 'coral', 'storms', 'globally', 'photographs', 'climate', 'believe', 'flooding', 'world', 'coastal', 'reefs', 'say', 'doesnt']",

Warning that its rate of melting is accelerating, scientists have urged nations to defend their shores against the flooding that is likely to ensue.

In the most complete picture of Antarctic ice sheet change to date, they found that over a quarter of century the melting in the region caused global seas to rise around 8mm.

Recommended Plastic and hazardous chemicals found in remotest parts of Antarctica

Future projections suggest this figure could rise to 15cm by the end of the century – a change that would leave coastal cities in a near constant state of flooding.

“It’s not a large number so the question I get asked most often is: why does that matter?” Professor Andrew Shepherd of the University of Leeds, who led the study. “First of all, the last time we did this assessment we concluded that the ice sheet was contributing 0.2 mm per year to sea level rise.”

“In the past five years it has stepped up to 0.6 mm per year – so that’s three times faster.”

The study was accompanied by warnings from leading scientists that the world is running out of time to save it from a changing climate.

Antarctica stores enough frozen water to raise global sea level by 58 metres and knowing how fast it is melting is of grave importance for policy makers.

Scientists used to think that Antarctica was protected from melting by warm waters because of Southern Ocean circulation acting as a kind of “thermal controller”.

However, it is increasingly clear that ice loss from West Antarctica in particular is speeding up as a result of contact between the floating ice shelves and warming ocean waters.

The new study by an international team known as the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (IMBIE) was assembled using data from 24 long-term satellite surveys of the region’s ice sheets.

Historically, the main contributors to sea level rise are melting ice from Greenland and mountain glaciers, as well as water expanding due to higher temperatures.

Although Professor Shepherd noted that ice losses from Antarctica will tend to impact northern hemisphere countries disproportionately, it is difficult to make specific predictions for the UK and other nations.

However, he said flood defences such as the Thames barrier will have to be reconsidered as new predictions emerge about the future sea level rise.

“I think 15 cm of sea level rise is a significant concern,” he said.

He added: “If you look at coastal cities like New York or San Francisco it tends to flood there when high tides coincide with storm conditions.""

Noting that such floods occur roughly once every year, he said: “If you raise the level by 15 cm in San Francisco it will flood 20 times a year if you don’t do anything to the sea wall, and 20 times a year in New York.”

Professor Chris Rapley, a climate scientist at University College London who was not involved in the study, said the work provided a valuable insight into the melting of Antarctica.

He compared the region to a “slumbering giant awakening” that could soon rival other sources of sea level rise.

Professor Martin Siegert, co-Director of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College, who was also not involved in the research, added: “Unfortunately, we appear to be on a pathway to substantial ice-sheet loss in the decades ahead, with longer term consequences for enhanced sea-level rise.

“If we aren't already alert to the dangers posed by climate change, this should be an enormous wake-up call.”

Professor Michiel van den Broeke of Utrecht University, a member of the IMBIE team, said that while preparations for flooding are already underway in his native Netherlands, news about Antarctica would force policy makers to “recalibrate” these plans.

Their IMBIE study appeared in the journal Nature alongside a series of studies looking at the past and future of Antarctica in a changing climate, including work looking at the impact of storms on the deterioration of ice shelves.

In a one of these papers, Professor Siegert and his colleagues presented two future scenarios in which Antarctica is either protected from or exposed to unrestricted greenhouse gas emissions and exploitation.

“Antarctic is being affected by global warming, and unless we curtail our carbon dioxide emissions within the next decade, and have a zero carbon economy within a few decades, we will be locked into substantial global changes, including those in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean,” he said.","Wed, 13 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/13/17/antarctic-iceberg.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,"['melting', 'change', 'climate', 'threat', 'cities', 'antarctica', 'study', 'sea', 'level', 'significant', 'photographs', 'coastal', 'faster', 'journey', 'ice', 'posing', 'believe', 'doesnt', 'major']", 
13,13,FL-2018-000070-BGD,Survivor of 2016 Fort Hood training accident recalls flood - ArmyTimes.com,https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2018/06/06/survivor-of-2016-fort-hood-training-accident-recalls-flood/,"KILLEEN, Texas — On June 2, 2016, Kameron Robinson was riding in the truck that rolled over in flooded Owl Creek on Fort Hood, claiming the lives of eight soldiers and a West Point cadet.

The Killeen Daily Herald reports Robinson was one of 12 on the truck during the drill and is one of three survivors.

Robinson, who’s no longer with the Army, recently decided to share the memories that haunt him two years later.

NCO blamed for accident that killed nine soldiers at Fort Hood Flash flood warnings had been issued and the crossing had been designated off-limits, but a platoon heading out for some Sergeant’s Time training on the morning of June 2, 2016 didn’t know that.

The drill was to be low-water familiarization training for newly assigned transport operators, and the weather had taken a turn for the worse with a heavy downpour of rain and severe flooding, Robinson said.

Robinson and other soldiers had reservations about conducting the training that morning.

“Amongst ourselves walking up to our vehicles, we were wondering if there was any word on the training because the rain was getting pretty bad,” Robinson said.

Robinson said just prior to departure on the training, he and other soldiers were approached by the platoon leader and by Staff Sgt. Miguel Colonvazquez, who were discussing that morning’s training.

Robinson and the other soldiers asked: Did you not see the flash flood warnings we’ve been getting? Are you sure we should be going out there?

Robinson said the platoon leader’s response was, because the platoon hadn’t done training in some time, the training needed to go forward.

After the platoon leader left the area, the soldiers told Colonvazquez they didn’t feel comfortable with the morning’s training because of the weather. Robinson said Colonvazquez left to speak with the platoon leader about altering the training plan but returned a short time later stating the training had to go forward as planned.

Robinson said Colonvazquez, in the past, had fought against doing things he was uncomfortable doing but would follow the orders given to him.

Robinson said he and Colonvazquez, Spc. Christine Faith Armstrong, Spc. Rogelio Morales, Spc. Tyrail Friend, Pfc. Brandon Austin Banner, Pfc. Zachery Nathaniel Fuller, Pvt. Isaac Lee Deleon, Pvt. Eddy Raelaurin Gates, Pvt. Tysheena Lynette James, Spc. Yingming Sun and Cadet Mitchell Alexander Winey got in their Light Medium Tactical Vehicle or LMTV.

Colonvasquez, Winey and James were in the cab of the vehicle. The rear of the LMTV, about 5 feet off the ground, was equipped with two bench seats along the sides. On the left, behind the driver, beginning toward the cab, were Robinson, Friend, Gates, Sun and Fuller. On the right side were Banner, Morales, Armstrong and DeLeon.

On the way to the training area, the soldiers talked among themselves or caught a quick nap. When the vehicle stopped, Robinson told the other soldiers to get ready because he believed they were at the training location.

“We’re sitting there, and the vehicle is slowly moving, and all the sudden water started hitting our feet, and I’m thinking, ‘OK, a little bit of water, we’re just going to go over it and that will be it,’” Robinson said. “The water started rising and rising, and it got to my knee caps and everybody started panicking a little bit.”

Robinson tried to calm the soldiers, telling them, it’s just a little bit of water, and it will eventually recede, and they’d be fine. Then, the water was at their waist. Robinson said to lift the flap on the back of the tarp-covered vehicle, so he could see their surroundings. He looked behind them.

“All I saw were the other convoy trucks, the ground and a mountain of water between them and us.”

The water reached Robinson’s chest, but he continued to try reassuring the other soldiers to not panic, because panicking under water can lead to drowning.

Then, the truck was completely submerged.

“I’m hanging onto the bars on the top of the (LMTV canopy support), and I just feel the whole truck rolling, thinking to myself that I’m about to just drown, in a military vehicle, in a training accident,” Robinson said. “I’m just sitting there thinking, it felt like forever, and the vehicle just pops back up. There were nine of us back there, but when it pops back up there’s three.”

Robinson said DeLeon was in front of him and asked what had happened. He told DeLeon to take off his gear and get out of the truck and the water. He next saw Gates hanging from the tailgate looking back.

“I told her, ‘don’t worry about it, I’m going to come get you, and we’re going to go out,’” Robinson said. “As soon as I took a step, the truck flipped over again, and it threw me out. I swam across and grabbed a branch, the truck hit me, and I went back under.”

Robinson eventually resurfaced and grabbed another branch and sat up on a knee, then heard a blood-curdling scream.

“Morales, he screamed, but it wasn’t a normal scream,” Robinson said. “It was a scream you don’t really hear often, so it put me in a state of shock, and I couldn’t move.”

Robinson said Morales asked him what had happened.

“I looked over, and I saw Friend (on the bank) throwing up water screaming, ‘Help me, help me! I’m drowning,‘” Robinson said. “I couldn’t move, I’d never seen anything like that, so I was just staring at him.”

Robinson heard branches moving and breaking as other soldiers from vehicles behind them in the convoy arrived to help. He collected himself and remembered Gates was on the back tailgate so he headed downstream to look for her and other potential survivors.

“I took off all my stuff, and I took off downriver screaming for anybody there, looking along the bank, looking for anybody,” Robinson said. “I went down a good mile screaming names, but nobody was answering.

He had been joined by a soldier from the convoy.

“We didn’t see nobody. all we saw was the (truck’s) drip pan floating down the river.”

Robinson thought perhaps the others had escaped on the other side of the bank when he heard a soldier calling out names.

“I heard him screaming ‘Staff Sgt. Colon, Fuller, Armstrong,’ everybody’s name, but there was no response,” Robinson said.

Robinson returned to the spot of the initial accident and was met by emergency responders. He was taken to the hospital in nearby Gatesville and eventually to Darnell Army Medical Center.

“I told them (hospital staff) if they find anybody to let us know and keep us updated, and that’s when they started letting us know they found bodies,” Robinson said.

Robinson said agents from the Army’s Criminal Investigation Division arrived at the hospital to get statements.

“They just asked us what happened, who made the call (to do the training),” Robinson said. “They were looking for somebody to blame.” Robinson told them what had happened but did not mention who had made the call.

Robinson spent about four days in the hospital. The platoon leader who had insisted they conduct the training visited him.

“He came in crying, but I was like, ‘don’t give me none of that,’ because we could have avoided all of this had he just simply listened to us,” Robinson said.

After being discharged from the hospital, Robinson was given two weeks of leave to recover before returning to work. A gag order was issued by the command and none of the soldiers could speak about the accident. To date, no other investigating officials from either Army’s C.I.D. or the Fort Hood unit have interviewed Robinson. The investigating officer appointed by Fort Hood had concluded much of the blame rested with Colonvazquez.

“The only people that talked to me were (on) the day of (the accident) at the hospital,” Robinson said. “At least get a statement from us, from our point of view.”

In the months that followed the accident, Robinson got the feeling the chain of command didn’t care about them. He said the platoon leader was moved to another unit immediately after the accident and has since been promoted.

“After the unit started treating us a certain way, I didn’t want to be around them anymore,” Robinson said.

“I couldn’t really focus and being trapped here in the same unit, was just messing with my mind,” Robinson said.

Robinson said he sought assistance from several agencies on the installation where he could speak to others about the trauma he went through.

He began experiencing financial problems after what he said was a series of mishaps with his military orders which resulted in his pay being temporarily stopped.

“I didn’t get paid for three months, I had my car repossessed, so I was just in a bad spot and depressed,” Robinson said.

Robinson, who was already enrolled in the Army’s Substance Abuse Program, informed his counselors of his use of marijuana to help deal with the depression and anxiety he was experiencing.

In June 2017, he was arrested for soliciting prostitution. It was his first arrest for anything, he said. He paid court fees, was assigned to take a class at a school for offenders and will be on probation for two months.

He later failed a drug test and was separated from the Army on Jan. 24 with a general discharge under honorable conditions for a rehabilitative failure.

It’s been four years since the Santa Maria, California, native shipped out for the Army on March 17, 2014, to be trained as a motor transport operator.

He arrived at Fort Hood in July 2014 assigned to Company F, 3rd Battalion, 16th Field Artillery Regiment, 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team. After completing a rotation to the Republic of Korea, he returned to Fort Hood, just prior to the deadly training accident.

Robinson is currently enrolled at Colorado Technical University online studying to earn a bachelor’s degree health care management in an attempt to pick up the pieces of his life and hope for a more promising future.

He still suffers from the traumatic events of June 2, 2016.

“I’m still kind of messed up about it, this is something I’m not going to forget,” Robinson said. “I had gotten too close to those people for them to be gone like that.”","Wed, 06 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/uvZEnQEF8eRZB4QDO0Fmv_7K0h4=/1200x630/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-mco.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A7GFEU2AG5CHNOEVVELEC6PR3Y.jpg,"['platoon', 'flood', 'training', 'told', 'water', 'survivor', 'accident', '2016', 'vehicle', 'truck', 'fort', 'army', 'hood', 'soldiers', 'recalls', 'robinson']",

The pre-monsoon rainfall this year in the region is about 75% more than average, weather officials said.

Mizoram

Floods and landslides after heavy rainfall have disrupted normal life in Mizoram since Sunday. State government officials say reports of largescale destruction of public infrastructure and private properties are trickling in from the sparsely populated state.

However, there have been no reports of any casualties.

According to the latest reports collected by the state’s department of disaster management and department of information and public relations, floods affected as many as 10 villages in Lunglei district. More than 500 families had to be evacuated, mostly in Chakma-dominated Tlabung town on the border with Bangladesh. Landslides damaged another 22 houses in Lunglei, officials say.

Along with Lunglei, Mamit is the other worst affected district. Officials say as many as 250 houses submerged under water due to floods. Affected families had to be evacuated. Rains brought Aizawl to a halt too even as landslides blocked the main route to Lengpui airport on the outskirts of the capital. The road has since been cleared.

Manipur

Incessant rains have caused havoc in the last three days, including flooding and landslides, at many places in Manipur on Wednesday.

The state government declared holiday for all government establishments except essential services on Wednesday on account of the ‘sudden flood’, while the education department has declared holiday for all government and private educational institutions on account of the ‘grim flood situation’ for two days till Thursday.

The situation has worsened after the Imphal and Kongba river banks were breached at New Checkon and Kongba Uchekon areas in Imphal East district, officials said.

It also submerged large residential areas in Imphal East district, including VIP colonies housing ministers and top bureaucrats, besides important government offices, including All India Radio (AIR) Imphal, which temporarily suspended their radio service since morning as flood hit the office.

Residents of Thongju and Kshetrigao constituencies also faced similar fate as Kongba river breached near Kongba (Uchekon) Lai Moriba in Imphal East district.

Hundreds of localities in Imphal East, Imphal West, Bishnupur and Thoubal districts faced flash flood after several rivers including Imphal, Nambul,Nambol,Thoubal,Maklang overflowing at many places while many of them vacated their houses after flood water entered their homes.Not only residential areas, the rain and flash floods destroyed standing crops in many places.

While the Valley is reeling under flash flood, landslide on the Imphal-Jiribam highway cut off road connectivity between the state capital and three district headquarters of Noney,Tamenglong and Jiribam.

Around 70 feet of the national highway 37 between Sinam and Laijang villages in the Imphal-Jiribam sector, about 40 km from Imphal, broke off on Wednesday morning forcing suspension of normal vehicular movement, officials said.

Tripura

Over 6,000 families were rendered homeless due to floods caused by heavy rainfall measuring 86 mm in Tripura in last 24 hours, which also left two persons dead.

A report from the state emergency operation centre claimed that 3,472 families took shelter in 64 camps set up by state government throughout the state and about 41 houses were damaged in the flood.

One man was missing and suspected to be washed away in the flood and one woman was injured due to landslide.

Flood mainly hit parts all the districts with no report of damage and homeless families from Sepahijala and West Districts.

The Met Department warned of heavy rainfall in next 24 hours in the region saying that a 275.9 mm rainfall was recorded since June 1. This year, total 979.9 mm pre-monsoon rainfall was recorded as against the normal 574.2 mm.

“The state received 75% more rainfall on an average than the normal pre-monsoon rainfall. This is an exception this year,” a Met official said. In May, over 17,000 families were rendered homeless due to flood.","Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/06/13/Pictures/india-weather-monsoon_1939a772-6f1c-11e8-9a75-8898ac94ce9e.jpg,"['evacuation', 'flood', 'floods', 'rainfall', 'state', 'rain', 'families', 'including', 'imphal', 'district', 'parts', 'residents', 'officials', 'northeast', 'premonsoon', 'leads', 'landslides']",

Three upazilas in the district were inundated due to incessant rainfall for last three days till Wednesday morning causing several thousand people marooned.

Severe flooding has been reported in Hathazari, Raozan and Fatikchhari upazilas of Chattogram district that caused trouble and sufferings to the people.

In Hathazari, regional roads, fish enclosures, houses and business establishments were submerged by the rain water.

Besides, embankments of Halda River in different points were collapsed, increasing the woes of the people. The Hathazari-Rangamati, Hathazari-Khagrachhari and Hathazari-Oxygen highways were inundated causing immense sufferings to the commuters.

Hathazari Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Akterunnesa Sheuli said the local administration has taken all out preparation to tackle any kind of natural disaster.

The inhabitants of low-lying areas have been asked to take shelter in local educational institutions, she said.

In Raozan, heavy rains flooded many low-lying areas in the upazila.

Nearly one lakh people in six unions--Haldia, Dabua, Chikdair, Ghahira, Noajishpur, Purba Gujra and Raozan-- have been trapped in the rain water.

People were seen wading through the knee-deep water on Chattogram-Rangamati road on Tuesday. Besides, traffic remained suspended on the road.

Shamim Hossain, UNO of Raozan upazila, said onrush hill water and persistent rains for the last three days have inundated at least six unions of the upazila.

A total of 24 shelter centres have been opened as well as a control room will be in operation for 24 hours, he added.

Besides, leave of all the employees and staffs of the local administration were cancelled and all of them were asked to remain in their work place round the clock, the UNO added.

In Fatikchhari upazila, persistent rains for the last three days led to severe flooding in 12 unions of the upazila.

The Aman seedbeds were damaged while fish of different ponds were washed way.

Meanwhile, Taiab, 28, a resident of Purba Farhadabad reportedly went missing in the flood water around 4:30 pm on Tuesday.

Khurshid Alam, Gauge Station officer of Water Development Board in Narayanhat, said the water of Halda River has been flowing 5.90 centimetre above the water level till 6 pm on Tuesday.

Some fifty villages in the upazila including Dharmapur, Committee Bazar, Bakhatpur, Shamitir Haat, Nischintapur, Azadi Bazar, West Dharmapur, Lelang, Gopal Ghata, Kanchan Nagar, Manikpur, Telparoi, Manik gola, Paschim Bakhatpur, Okhara, Rosanggiri, Paschim Nanupur, Maizbhandar, Azimnagar, Suabil, Sundarpur, Purba Harualchhari, Paidong, Bherajali, Shetkua, Doulatpur, Kumbar Par, Dhurong, Rangamatia were inundated by the flood water, rendering 300,000 people marooned.","Wed, 13 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/uploads/1528869071.jpg,"['inundate', 'flood', 'uno', 'rain', 'water', 'upazilas', 'upazila', 'incessant', 'inundated', 'purba', 'local', 'chattogram', 'raozan', 'rains']", 
16,16,FL-2018-000070-BGD,Chinese trademark filings flood foreign markets - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-trends/Chinese-trademark-filings-flood-foreign-markets,"TOKYO -- Chinese trademark applications in Japan, the U.S. and Europe swelled nearly sevenfold in the three years through 2017 as government subsidies aimed at building global brands prompted a disruptive deluge of filings.

China can often be an unfriendly place for foreign companies looking to register trademarks -- an essential part of doing business. When a Japanese organization tried in 2009 to trademark Imabari towels, known for their quality, its application was rejected on the grounds that a Chinese company had already trademarked the characters for ""Imabari.""

In some cases, so-called trademark trolls register valuable brand names and the like pre-emptively, then force the companies that actually use the marks to buy or sue for the rights.

At the same time, the Chinese government has encouraged companies to seek trademarks overseas, particularly since last year, when it adopted policies to further its brand trademarking strategy. A similar push in patents has made the country the world's second-largest filer.

China is poised to overtake the U.S. this year as the top source of trademark applications in Japan. The Japan Patent Office reported 8,464 Chinese filings for 2017, up more than fivefold from 2014. Chinese trademark applications filed with the European Union Intellectual Property Office more than quadrupled over the period.

The U.S. received more than 50,000 applications from China in the year through September 2017, accounting for 8.5% of all trademark filings. The eightfold surge from fiscal 2014 lifted China far above such other big filers as the U.K., Canada and Germany.

Chinese businesses that apply for foreign trademarks have been able to receive government subsidies since last year. Such payments in Zhejiang Province amount to half the cost of filing in Europe and the U.S. and 70% in emerging countries, according to local media.

Many of the applications in the U.S. come from small, obscure online retailers apparently just looking to collect the subsidies. The Wall Street Journal notes numerous cases of multiple filings using images of nearly identical products differing only in the brand on the tag.

Though competition for trademarks is far from unique to China, some analysts worry that the subsidies could distort the competitive landscape and disrupt legitimate business activity. The payments may be intended to ""undermine the U.S. trademark system,"" writes Josh Gerben of the Gerben Law Firm, which specializes in trademark issues. The flood of Chinese filings has alarmed the Japan Patent Office as well.

""China has issues such as pre-emptive trademark registration alongside an advanced intellectual property strategy,"" said Rensei Baba, who heads a Japanese nonprofit organization dealing with intellectual property and other issues.

18,18,FL-2018-000070-BGD,Japan's Climate Change Preparedness an Example for Asian Countries - BRINK,https://www.brinknews.com/japans-climate-change-preparedness-an-example-for-asian-countries/,"This is the fourth article in a weeklong series focused on climate-related topics. The previous articles can be read here, here, and here.

To understand Japan’s complex relationship with water, we must first turn to its topography. Nearly three-quarters of Japan’s land is mountainous, which forms the basis of its steep and short rivers. This limits the amount of rainwater that can be captured before it flows into the sea. As a nation that receives intense rainfall during specific periods of the year (rainy season from June to July and typhoon season from August to September), Japan has traditionally suffered from extreme floods.

In addition, Japan’s population is concentrated in areas with low elevation. Alluvial plains—areas lower than the flood water level of a flooded river—account for only 10 percent of the total land area. Yet, more than 50 percent of the population and 75 percent of the gross assets are concentrated in these plains. Tokyo, the capital city of Japan, is also built on alluvial plains. In fact, 13,120 square kilometers of Tokyo’s area is in the “zero-meter zone,” referring to land where the elevation is at or below sea level.

Droughts and Floods in Japan

The high concentration of the Japanese population in small habitable areas has made Japan historically vulnerable to droughts. Water supply areas affected by drought at least once in the past 30 years are shown on the map.

Exhibit: Areas Affected by Droughts Over the Past 30 Years

Prior to Japan’s modernization period, most of Japan’s water shortages were caused by severe droughts: 1939 Lake Biwa, 1964 Tokyo Olympics, 1967 Nagasaki, 1973 Takamatsu, and 1978 Fukuoka are some of the examples. According to a meta-analysis of Japan’s droughts from 1902 to 2009, the most severe drought took place from 1939 to 1941, lasting for 666 days. This drought very seriously affected water supply, electricity, hydropower generation, factories, railway and marine transportations. It was even considered the reason for the nationalization of major industries.

A more recent example is the nationwide drought that began in spring and ended in mid-September of 1994. The continuing low rainfall had deteriorated the water quality of major rivers near Lakes Sagami, Tsukui and Tanzawa and forced the rationing of water supply. Water rationing began in June in the Kiso River basin and spread to other districts. In the most extreme cases, water for irrigation and industrial use was rationed to a maximum of 65 percent—and 35 percent in the case of domestic uses. Rainfall started in September, and water rationing was relaxed and finally lifted in November.

Japan has also been fighting floods for centuries, and its evolving flood management has been documented extensively. The Tokyo that we know today is a product of engineering of the Tone River to the east and the Arakawa River to the west during the Tokugawa era (1603–1867). To avoid disasters in Tokyo’s east lowlands, the Arakawa Channel and Edogawa Channel and a reclamation land at Kasai were constructed. Dr. Nobuyuki Tsuchiya, chairperson of Japan River Restoration Network, warns against the current false sense of security in Tokyo, stressing that simulations have shown that there is a high probability of floods affecting lowlands and localities with lower height of dykes on the left side of the Arakawa River. He predicts that, as sea level rises due to climate change, in times of high tides, Edogawa city (one of Tokyo’s wards) could be flooded within two days. In light of the high population density in eastern lowlands, he urges the population to remain vigilant toward natural disasters.

What Can Be Done?

Given the extreme risks of floods, extensive infrastructure development as well as forested areas, or green dams, have become essential elements for flood management in the country. The strong support toward forest management for water management primarily comes from the civil society and has largely been shaped by the media rather than academia.

Forests cannot replace dams or vice versa: They complement each other. Dams continue to be constructed and, at the same time, policies, laws and regulations are enacted, promoting integrated forest and water management at the national level.

Coming back to extreme events such as droughts and floods, the Bureau of Waterworks, under the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, has planned for mitigation and adaptation measures in the face of climate change impacts on waterworks. It estimates that the number of days with heavy rain (100 mm or more per day) is expected to increase to up to 10 days per year in the next 100 years.

Mitigation measures include use of renewable energy, forest conservation and drainage infrastructure for leakage prevention. With respect to adaptation measures, not surprisingly, the National Plan for Adaptation to the Impacts of Climate Change also considers natural disasters.

Japan has been affected by extreme events such as droughts and floods throughout its history, which has made its institutions and its society aware of the importance of preparedness. With climate variability and change, these events are only expected to increase.

Can Asia Learn from the Japan Experience?

The level of preparedness shown by Japan can be a lesson for numerous countries in the region—and globally—that are still to plan or are planning for the impacts resulting from changing climate.

There are numerous lessons countries in Asia can learn from Japan, including applied knowledge on hydrology, water resources management, management of droughts and floods, and public awareness and education for disaster prevention. However, in terms of adaptation in the region, just one example suffices. In the 1970s, Japan realized the importance of understanding water resources as part of the entire hydrological system rather than trying to control them by means of infrastructure alone. The pioneering work of Professor Yutaka Takahasi, the most renowned hydrologist of Japan, was essential for the country to accept the then path-breaking concept of water management at the basin level. Over the years, this has proven to be critical in achieving a more efficient management of water resources, including for floods and droughts. More than 40 years later, this concept has still not been implemented in most of the developing world.","Wed, 06 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.brinknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GettyImages-500720086.jpg,"['droughts', 'change', 'management', 'japan', 'population', 'water', 'climate', 'countries', 'extreme', 'tokyo', 'japans', 'example', 'preparedness', 'asian', 'river', 'floods']",

A three-day International Refugee Rights Conference opening in Toronto Thursday June 7 provides an opportunity to highlight the issue.

Our award-winning journalists bring you the news that impacts you, Canada, and the world. Don't miss out. That includes climate-induced migration, resulting from forced or voluntary displacement resulting from acute disasters or long-term environmental degradation.

Although the international community recognizes current and anticipated climate-induced human crisis, the world is largely unprepared to address it. This is in part because of the scale of climate-induced migration and the lack of legal recognition of the concept of “climate refugees” in international law. Policies are absent The 2018 Global Report on Internal Displacement found about 96 per cent of disaster-related internal displacement in 2017 was due to weather. That was virtually the same as the previous year. Given rising emissions and global temperatures, large scale migration and instability are likely to intensify.

Moreover, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate-related impacts are bound to deepen poverty and further threaten livelihoods. Over the long term, this is manifested as reduced crop yields, increased aridity, decreased water quality, and rising sea levels. In the short term, increased internal displacement and cross-boundary migration will be exacerbated by extreme weather events. Despite the known and forecasted impacts of climate change, there is an absence of an effective policy framework in addressing resulting human migration. Last summer a strong monsoon season caused numerous floods and landslides across Nepal, Bangladesh, and India, displacing millions of people. Around the same time, the United States and the Caribbean islands were battered by several strong hurricanes. Thousands of Puerto Ricans fled to the mainland United States in the wake of hurricane Maria. International Refugee Rights Conference in Toronto June 7-9 organized by @ccrweb provides opportunity to address urgent issue of #climatechange #refugees #migration On the one hand, there is the issue of defining who is a refugee. The United Nations Refugee Convention defines a refugee as someone who has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion; is outside the country of their nationality; and is unable or unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country. On the other hand, there is the issue of determining if a person meets the required criteria. Distinguishing between voluntary and forced climate-induced migration can be difficult to prove, especially in cases of slow-onset disasters such as droughts and agricultural degradation. The decision to flee one’s home is complex and often involves a variety of factors, making it difficult to demonstrate that climate change was the main driver. Those who choose to leave their homeland are often confronted with policies aimed at containing and deterring refugees, from the imposition of visas, to airline carrier sanctions and barriers at offshore processing and transit centers. What steps can Canada take? If we accept that climate-induced migration poses a serious threat to global stability, then what steps can the Canadian government take to mitigate this? Most climate-induced migration is regional and given Canada’s relative geographical isolation, it is unlikely to experience a large influx of climate refugees. An important part of Canada’s response, therefore, is through a combination of development assistance to affected regions and by offering resettlement to countries hosting large numbers of climate refugees. Despite the absence of an international legal framework for climate refugees, there is a long history in Canada of working outside the Refugee Convention. In 1972, the government used an “oppressed minority” policy to resettle over 6,000 Ugandan Asians who were not considered refugees according to the Convention since they had not left their country of origin.","Thu, 07 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/nationalobserver.com/files/img/2017/09/06/screen_shot_2017-09-06_at_10.36.13_am.png,"['refugees', 'refugee', 'change', 'urgent', 'need', 'displacement', 'climate', 'migration', 'issue', 'international', 'climateinduced', 'united', 'recognize']",

The two countries also signed an agreement under which China has agreed to import non-Basmati rice from India which is likely to bridge the ballooning trade deficit to a certain extent.

The two Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) were signed after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held detailed discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping on bilateral and global issues which will add further vigour to the India-China friendship after their informal summit in Wuhan.

Modi arrived in the picturesque coastal city of China’s Shandong province on a two-day visit to attend the annual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).

Last year, China had stopped sharing data soon after the 73-day long stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops at Dokalam over Chinese military’s plans to build a road close to India’s Chicken Neck corridor connecting North-Eastern states.

The first MoU was inked between China’s Ministry of Water Resources and India’s Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation upon provision of hydrological information of the Brahmaputra river in flood season by China to India.

The agreement enables China to provide hydrological data in flood season from May 15 to October 15 every year. It also enables the Chinese side to provide hydrological data if water level exceeds mutually agreed level during non-flood season.

China, an upstream country, shares the scientific study of the movement, distribution and quality of water data for the river.

Originating from Tibet, the Brahmaputra is one of the major rivers in China. From Tibet it flows down to India and later enters Bangladesh where it joins the Ganga.

The second MoU was signed between China’s General Administration of Customs and India’s Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare on Phytosanitary requirements for exporting rice from India to China, one of the world’s biggest rice markets.

The 2006 Protocol on Phytosanitary Requirements for Exporting Rice from India to China has been amended to include the export of non-Basmati varieties of rice from India.

At present, India can only export Basmati rice to China.

Sources said the pact on non-Basmati rice may help in addressing India’s concerns over widening trade deficit which has been in China’s favour.

China has been promising to address the issue of trade deficit with India which has been seeking a greater market access for its goods and services in China.

Trade deficit with China stood at USD 36.73 billion during April-October this fiscal.

India’s trade deficit with China has marginally dipped to USD 51 billion in 2016-17 from USD 52.69 billion in the previous fiscal

This new project is most likely to appear as a potential disaster to the downstream villagers and farmers in Assam and the wildlife and environment of Manas National Park.

The existing Kurichu Hydro-Electric Project authorities have been releasing excess water during rainy days or flood creating havoc in downstream. There are instances when unannounced release of water of Kurichu dam by Bhutan jeopardized the lives of thousands of people downstream. In the last few years, there were many incidents of sudden rise in the water levels of river Beki that washed away embankments, roads, and bridges.

The new project will be built on Kurichu after the confluence of river Dorjilung. The Government of India has formed a review team to revise the guidelines on cross-border trade of electricity it is not concerned about the potential devastating floods in downstream areas in Assam.

Lyonpo Lekey Dorji, the economic affairs minister, revealed on Tuesday, the memorandum of understanding for the 1125MW Kuri-I or Dorjilung project would be signed at an occasion when leaders of all three countries – Bhutan, Bangladesh and India would meet.

Authorities of the two districts in Assam, Barpeta and Baksa have been alleging that there was no prior warning by Bhutan before releasing the water from its Kurichu dam, which affected several thousand families and flooded Manas and Beki rivers, the two principle tributaries of Brahmaputra river in lower Assam as well as large area of Manas National Park, a UNESCO heritage site, were inundated on Wednesday night after an embankment was breached.

Lekey Dorji said that talks are still under consideration by the three countries. “To this effect, the draft MoU that provides broad framework for trilateral cooperation stands shared among the three countries and still being reviewed by respective authorities in finalising it,” he told the Kuensel, the official newspaper of Bhutan.

The draft MoU provides for establishing a steering committee to work out the implementation modalities for approval by the three Governments. However, Lyonpo said that the government of India has formed a review team headed by the power secretary and that the team is currently working on revising the guidelines.

Lyonpo said the ministry formally received correspondence from the Government of India seeking views and comments from Bhutan on the CBTE through the Indian embassy.

“We have shared our concerns regarding the provisions of the guideline that would impact Bhutan, and considering that Bhutan is the only net exporter of electricity. The Government of India has taken our concerns and views positively,” he said. “We have been reassured that the Government of India would address our concerns, bearing in mind the special relations between two countries and the importance of hydropower cooperation,” he added.

While the CBTE is to facilitate cross border trading of electricity between India and the neighboring countries by promoting transparency, consistency and predictability in regulatory approaches across jurisdictions and to minimise the perception of regulatory risks, some of the provisions have affected the development of some projects. The concession agreement for Kholongchhu project is still on hold because of the issues with guidelines.

The guideline states that companies fully owned by the Governments of concerned countries, those that are funded by India and those having 51 per cent equity investment of Indian public and private companies could export power to the Indian market after obtaining a one-time approval from the designated authority in India.

This is for projects that are built or being built on inter-governmental modality, where import or export of electricity is agreed between the GoI and the government concerned. The tariff for such transaction is also determined through government-to-government negotiations, and the guidelines states that appropriate authorities in India also must adhere to such transactions.

However, any other participating entity shall be eligible to participate in cross border trade of electricity after obtaining approval of the designated authority on a case-to-case basis. This is applicable for JVs and PPP projects because Indian Public sector companies are not likely to hold 51 per cent of the shares.

There is an agreement between India and Bhutan to share river and weather data on the release of water from the Kurichu dam, but allegedly continues to release water from the dam without sharing the information with the Indian authorities.","Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://nenow.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/done-Manas.png,"['hydroelectric', 'india', 'project', 'bhutan', 'kurichu', 'intensify', 'water', 'kurii', 'countries', 'downstream', 'electricity', 'assam', 'river', 'indian', 'floods']",

What is shocking that the Assam sandbars are turning hotbeds for illegal migrants from Bangladesh posing threat to its demography and indigenous people, writes NANDITA SENGUPTA

The boats of vegetables and pulses that touch the Brahmaputra river bank in Guwahati every morning are mostly grown in the hundreds of fertile sandbars, locally called chars that dot the 800-km stretch of the mighty river of Assam — from Sadiya in the east to Dhubri in the west.

Though chars in the eastern parts of Assam are inhibited by the ethnic Mising tribes, the immigrant Muslims who had migrated to Assam from erstwhile Pakistan, even during the British reign, dominate the western parts which is close to present Bangladesh.

The similar living condition and the alluvial land in neighbouring Bangladesh and in Assam’s sandbars continue to attract the migrant Bangladeshis. The trend, however, has turned into a political issue in Assam over the decades as the sandbars are considered to be the den of “illegal migrants” from Bangladesh that threaten Assam’s demography and deepen the fear of identity crisis among the state’s ethnic tribes.

A committee constituted by the BJP-led government in the state that came to power in May 2016, said that chars have become a “safe haven for illegal migrants from Bangladesh” and is pushing the growing threat of identity to indigenous people of the state.

How do they Cross the International Boundaries?

The five-member committee, which submitted its report to Assam government in April this year said Bangladeshi migrants enter through the porous stretch of 1880-km Indo-Bangladesh borders that touches Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram.

According to a report it says, “The Border Security Forces (BSF) or other paramilitary forces that are entrusted with guarding the borders make their job easy by allowing these seekers of greener Pasteur in Assam to cross the border for a little personal gain. It is an open secret that anyone who wants to enter in to Assam has only to pay 200 or so.

In fact, the whole process of the immigration is conducted by well-knit special agencies or organisations that operate on both sides of the borders and take over the entire process of depositing the infiltrators in the Assam side of the borders. Before they cross the border, they are reportedly given language training, names of their destination and contacts on arrival in Assam.

Some private Madrassas are reported to play dominant roles in the whole process of sending such consignments to Assam. On reaching Assam, the infiltrators are taken over by the respective assignees who utilize their vibrant network to various destinations allotted to each and the process goes on silently and smoothly perennially.

And the Government of Assam finds no reason to be concerned with such arrivals which causes definite threats to the land rights of the indigenous citizens of Assam as also to their very identity.”

How do they settle in the sandbars?

The committee report said all lands in the char areas virtually belong to and are settled by a well-established institution known as Matabbar or Dewani. For all practical purposes, they play the real role of the government, making allotment of land to or settling land with new arrivals of the infiltrators from across the international borders, collecting revenue, exercising monopolistic authorities over the settlers who live there at the complete mercy of the Matabbar and controlling all facets of their activities.

They are the real Zamindars and wield tremendous political and financial clouts such that nobody can gather any courage to raise any voice against them if they want to live there or be alive at all. “To inject fear psychosis in their mind, the Matabbar has his ready weapon of threatening to get them detected by police.

So the Matabbar exercises the full power of the absenting government authorities and make allotment or settlement of land to the new arrivals of suspected Bangladeshis, give them money for being settled at highly exorbitant rate of interest and, in addition to keeping them in perpetual fear and control, the Matabbar builds the way to exploit them in all conceivable way, often treating the victims as animals,” said the report.

Gravity of the Problem

The Char villages spreading from Dhubri to Sadiya comprise a total area of 3,609.27 sq. Kms (2003-04) and accounts for 4.60 per cent of the state’s total geographical area. There are 2,251 Char villages spread in 14 of the state’s 36 districts and occupying 3,609. 27 sq. Kms of land with the Char area being the largest in Dhubri followed by Jorhat district, suggesting that the demography of Assam was fast changing due to high population growth rate in the char areas. The total population of the char areas in 2003-04 was 24.9. lakhs, with an explosive growth rate of 195.83 per cent in Dhubri (between 1992-2003) 98.85 per cent in Nagaon, 51.58 per cent in Jorhat, 58.30 per cent in Sonitpur and 59.25 per cent in Tinsukia.

“The most distressing point of concern is that almost all the settlers are either immigrants from erstwhile East Pakistan or Bangladesh, a section of whom has now become citizens as per the Assam Accord, 1983, or they are illegal Bangladeshis coming after 24 March, 1971- all living together without the illegal Bangladeshis being identified,” said the report.

The ploy to grab Assam land

The report says as the chars are in total control of the illegal migrants, they often wander in other places in Assam for jobs and new areas for encroachment. “While so wandering, they have their ploy handy and plead that they are flood and erosion-affected people displaced from their home Barpeta or Dhubri districts. They take advantage of the fact that the illegal Bangladeshis of Assam have not been identified and pose that they are citizens of India.”

“The fact, however, remains that they neither understand anything of the local language nor are they acquainted with the locality they want to grab. Their invisible leaders guide them and teach them one or two things about the local language or culture to hoodwink the local indigenous people or the police authority. Once they successfully grab the new lands/ areas in the community, they take the full benefits of the flood relief under the disaster management department of Assam government.

They, however, are different from the large population of indigenous Muslims in Assam. In fact, indigenous Muslims continue to complaint of fear of losing their identity from the Bengali speaking Muslims from Bangladesh.

Detection of illegal migrants

Assam, meanwhile, is about to update the National Register of Citizens 1951 to segregate its citizens and illegal migrants, mainly from Bangladesh. The NRC is being updated with Mach 24, 1971 as the cut-off date under the supervision of the Supreme Court, which directed the Centre to complete the exercise by June 30 this year.

This means those proving their/their forefathers’ stay in Assam (with documents) till March 24, 1971, will be enrolled as Indian citizens and those failing to do so will be identified as illegal migrants from Bangladesh.

Threat to ecology

The chars or sandbars are temporary accretions formed due to deposits of the silts carried by the river Brahmaputra and are highly susceptible to demolition due to strong river current during the high annual floods. As the report said, “When human habitation in the char obstructs its natural or new courses, it either demolishes the existing char or takes the easier route to maintain its unobstructed course by eroding new villages on its banks.

How different Assam sandbars from Bangladesh?

The report said the basic features of the chars of Assam and Bangladesh are same except that the average cropping intensity of the chars of Assam is more than that of Bangladesh probably because unlike in the chars of Bangladesh, the seawater alkaline components in the chars of Assam are non-existent. And, with the plentiful growth of luxuriant vegetation, high cropping intensity with minimum labour, fishing, boating and thatching opportunities, and above all, the absence of government administration and encouragement by both the “communal politicians and the Government of Assam, lured by vote bank politics, the chars of Assam have become the paradise of illegal Bangladeshis. Interestingly, human habitation in the chars of Bangladesh is known to be banned by Bangladesh government.

Who are the members of the committee?

The report was submitted by five members of the committee — former IAS officer Rohini Kumar Baruah, Gauhati University Law College dean Ramesh Borpatragohain, senior Gauhati High Court advocate Anil Bhattacharya, former Assam MLA Ajoy Dutta and a commissioner and secretary of the state revenue department.

What do Muslim organisations say?

Some Muslim organisations, however, see this report as “a ploy by the BJP government” to tag all char dwellers as illegal Bangladeshi migrants. They said the chars are mostly inhibited by Muslim migrants who were either brought by the British to grow food items in Assam or had settled in Assam before March 24, 1971, the cut-off date decided in the 1985 Assam Accord, for detection and deportation of foreigners.

The Irrigation Department authorities plan to step up the discharge from the Kabini reservoir in H.D. Kote taluk of Mysuru district in view of heavy rains in the upstream of the river.

This has augmented the inflow into the dam which was at the rate of 35,000 cusecs at noon on Thursday, up from nearly 22,098 cusecs when the gauge was measured at 6 a.m. Though the outflow from the reservoir has been pegged at 5,000 cusecs, authorities said it would be stepped up to nearly 20,000 cusecs by evening and have cautioned people living in the downstream of the Kabini reservoir and those along the banks of the river, to move to safer places.

“We have received information of heavy to very heavy rains in the catchment area of the Kabini in the neighbouring State of Kerala,” said the official who also pointed out that the water level at the dam was hovering 5 ft below the Full Reservoir Level (FRL).

As against the FRL of 2,284 ft, the water level at Kabini on Thursday was 2,279 ft in the afternoon whereas it was 2,276.55 feet a few hours earlier. Since the reservoir is expected to reach the full level by late in the evening or by night, and water cannot be impounded once the dam reaches its FRL, the authorities expect the discharge from the dam to increase further and hence the flood warning.

In view of the rains in the catchment area of the Cauvery in Bhagamandala and surrounding places, the inflow to the Krishnaraja Sagar reservoir has increased. The inflow was 28,383 cusecs on Thursday and the water level was 90.80 ft as against the FRL of 124.80 ft.

With the increase in water flow, people are flocking to the local falls and Chunchankatte, near K.R.Nagar, which is about 50 km from Mysuru.

However, the steps leading to the riverbanks have been barricaded and constables have been deployed to prevent the public from venturing too close to the river.

Global average yields of common crops such as soy beans and lentils are set to decrease as a result of increased temperatures and water shortages, it is claimed.

This could in turn have a knock-on effect on public health as key ingredients of a healthy diet become scarcer, warn researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

""Our study shows that environmental changes such as increased temperature and water scarcity may pose a real threat to global agricultural production, with likely further impacts on food security and population health,"" said lead scientist Dr Pauline Scheelbeek.

""Vegetables and legumes are vital components of a healthy, balanced and sustainable diet and nutritional guidelines consistently advise people to incorporate more vegetables and legumes into their diet.

""Our new analysis suggests, however, that this advice conflicts with the potential impacts of environmental changes that will decrease the availability of these important crops unless action is taken.""

Previous research has indicated that crop yields might be increased by raised levels of carbon dioxide greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.

But the new study, based on a systematic review of evidence dating back to 1975, shows this benefit is likely to be cancelled out by other environmental effects.

Researchers estimated the future impact of key factors influencing crop production, including increased levels of greenhouse gases, reduced availability of water for irrigation, and rising temperatures.

They predicted that global average yields of vegetables and legumes such as soy beans and lentils are predicted to be reduced by 35% and 9% respectively.

CIKHA, Myanmar: Breathless, fevered and without the extra oxygen that could help keep them alive, the new coronavirus patients at a hospital near Myanmar’s border with India highlight the threat to a health system near collapse since February’s coup.

To help her tend the seven COVID-19 patients at Cikha hospital, day and night, chief nurse Lun Za En has a lab technician and a pharmacist’s assistant.

Mostly, they offer kind words and paracetamol.

“We don’t have enough oxygen, enough medical equipment, enough electricity, enough doctors or enough ambulances,” Lun Za En, 45, told Reuters from the town of just over 10,000. “We are operating with three staff instead of 11.”

Myanmar’s anti-COVID campaign foundered along with the rest of the health system after the military seized power on Feb. 1 and overthrew elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose government had stepped up testing, quarantine and treatment.

Services at public hospitals collapsed after many doctors and nurses joined strikes in a Civil Disobedience Movement in the forefront of opposition to military rule — and sometimes on the frontline of protests that have been bloodily suppressed.

Thirteen medics have been killed, according to World Health Organization data that shows 179 attacks on health workers, facilities and transport — nearly half of all such attacks recorded worldwide this year, said WHO Myanmar representative Stephan Paul Jost.

Some 150 health workers have been arrested. Hundreds more doctors and nurses are wanted on incitement charges.

Neither a junta spokesman nor the health ministry responded to requests for comment. The junta, which initially set fighting the pandemic as one of its priorities, has repeatedly urged medics to return to work. Few have responded.

Testing collapsed

A worker at one COVID-19 quarantine center in Myanmar’s commercial capital, Yangon, said all the specialist health workers there had joined the Civil Disobedience Movement.

“Then again, we don’t receive new patients any more as COVID test centers don’t have staff to test,” said the worker, who declined to give his name for fear of retribution.

In the week before the coup, COVID-19 tests nationally averaged more than 17,000 a day. That had fallen below 1,200 a day in the seven days through Wednesday.

Myanmar has reported more than 3,200 COVID-19 deaths from over 140,000 cases, although the slump in testing has raised doubts over data that shows new cases and deaths have largely plateaued since the coup.

Now, a health system in crisis is raising concerns about the likely impact on the country from the wave of infections with variants that is sweeping through India, Thailand and other neighbors.

Patients with COVID-19 symptoms started showing up at Cikha hospital in mid-May. It is only 6 km (four miles) from India, and health workers fear the illness could be the highly infectious B.1.617.2 strain — though they lack the means to test for it.

“It’s very concerning that COVID-19 testing, treatment and vaccinations are extremely limited in Myanmar as more lives are at risk with new, more dangerous variants spreading,” said Luis Sfeir-Younis, Myanmar COVID-19 operations manager for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

Surge of cases

Twenty-four cases have been identified in Cikha, said Lun Za En. Seven were so serious they needed hospitalization — a sign of how few cases had likely been detected.

Stay-at-home orders have now been declared in parts of Chin state, where Cikha is located, and neighboring Sagaing region.

The WHO said it was trying to reach authorities and other groups in the area who could provide help, while recognizing the difficulties in a health system that was precipitously reversing years of impressive gains.

“It is not clear how this will be resolved, unless there is a resolution at the political level addressing the political conflict,” said Jost.

Lun Za En said her hospital was doing the best it could with nebulizers — machines that turn liquid to mist — to relieve breathlessness. Some patients have oxygen concentrators, but they only work for the two hours a day that the town gets electricity.

Refusing to abandon the sick, Lun Za En said she decided not to join the strikes.

“The junta will not take care of our patients,” she said.

Across Myanmar, some striking doctors have set up underground clinics to help patients. When Myanmar Red Cross volunteers established three clinics in Yangon neighborhoods, they quickly had dozens of patients.

At best, such options can provide basic care.

“Eighty percent of the hospitals are public health hospitals,” said Marjan Besuijen, head of mission for the Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) aid group. “As MSF or others we can’t step in, it’s too big.”

Although military hospitals have been opened to the public, many people fear them or refuse to go on principle — including for coronavirus vaccinations in a campaign the ousted government had launched days before the coup.

“I am very worried that these new infections will spread all over the country,” said Lun Za En. “If the infection spreads to the crowded cities, it could be uncontrollable.” (Reporting by Reuters staff; Writing by Matthew Tostevin; Editing by Richard Pullin and William Mallard)","Thu, 07 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/main-image/2018/06/07/1214226-573331307.jpg,"['surface', 'patients', 'defends', 'system', 'war', 'workers', 'hospitals', 'za', 'drug', 'claims', 'murder', 'health', 'bangladesh', 'covid19', 'en', 'myanmar', 'lun']",

Updated at 1:03 p.m. ET on 2018-06-20

After watching a viral video of a bus crash at a Dhaka intersection, bus driver Mohammad Faruk Hawlader merely shrugged.

The video shows a man casually crossing the road in the middle of an intersection where there is no pedestrian lane. A bus speeds by and barely misses him. Oblivious, he keeps walking until two other buses violently collide close behind him.

“I have witnessed many terrible accidents with my own eyes,” Hawlader, a 48-year-old father of two, told BenarNews, without elaborating.

The clip offers a glimpse of the traffic gridlock in Dhaka and just how dangerous and chaotic the roads can be for the 7 million bus drivers, rickshaw operators and others who work in Bangladesh’s public transportation sector.

They drive for many hours at a stretch, for very low pay, and mostly without written contracts from their employers or driver’s licenses, union representatives say.

Bangladesh, a South Asian nation of 163 million people, has one of the world’s highest death rates from road crashes, according to the World Bank.

In 2016, at least 6,055 people were killed in road accidents around the country, the Bangladesh Passengers Welfare Association said. During the previous year, more than 8,600 people died on the nation’s roads, it said.

The public transportation sector factors heavily in Bangladesh’s poor road safety record, according to statistics compiled by the national police.

From 1998 to 2005, four out of 10 traffic accidents in Dhaka city involved at least one transit bus, and nearly 40 percent of those crashes were classified as fatal, police figures show.

“The bus drivers of our country usually die prematurely and most of those who survive are paralyzed,” Majibur Rahman Khan, acting president of Dhaka City Road Transport Workers Union, told BenarNews.

Long hours, low pay

Hawlader said Bangladeshi drivers can spend 18 hours a day negotiating the streets of Dhaka, where, according to independent studies, the average traffic speed is only 7 km per hour (4 mph).

Other drivers pull longer hauls that take them far from the capital.

Most of the buses in Bangladesh are privately owned, and many drivers and their assistants are paid for each trip they complete. They don’t receive a fixed salary or overtime compensation, and are also not paid extra if they encounter delays during a road trip.

Most agreements between bus owners and transport workers are verbal, not written.

“They all work on a per-trip agreement. Because of that, they do not get an extra fee for additional work,” State Minister for Labor and Employment Mujibul Haque told BenarNews.

Jakir Hossain (pictured), 45, has worked as a long-haul bus driver for 17 years.

Hossain often drives an inter-district route between Dhaka and Gopalganj, in southwestern Bangladesh.

“Moving to the destination and returning from there is considered a ‘trip,’ and in this way our fee is calculated,” he told BenarNews.

“Due to traffic congestion at the ferry terminal, sometimes it takes 36 to 48 hours to complete a trip on the Dhaka-Gopalganj route,” he said.

As long as public transportation drivers are working without written contracts and paid per trip, there will be sharp competition for passengers and pressure to complete trips quickly, thereby increasing dangers on the nation’s roadways, according to a union leader.

“This is the main reason” for the high number of road accidents, Osman Ali, secretary general of the Road Transport Workers Federation, told BenarNews.

Transport and police officials often blame drivers for accidents, citing rash driving as the chief cause.

But drivers told BenarNews that their passengers constantly hassle them to drive fast, distracting them from their work and goading them to drive aggressively.

“We have to quarrel with the passengers during the day and at night with the bus owner,” minibus driver Mohammad Bashir, 32, told BenarNews.

Despite typical 18-hour days driving on congested roads, Dhaka drivers only make an average daily income of about 1,200 taka (about U.S. $14), he said.

Haque, the state minister for labor and employment, said the government tried several initiatives but it had failed to persuade owners of bus companies and transportation firms to give their drivers and workers written employment contracts in order to alleviate the workplace grievances.

“We said that the workers should be given appointment letters, but the owners are not very interested,” Haque told Benar, referring to letters that serve as contracts.

Bus drivers: ‘Main culprits’

Transport workers were the target of a recent editorial by the Dhaka Tribune that bore the sensational headline “Murderers behind Wheels.”

“Time and time again, the main culprits are the bus drivers,” the May 18 editorial railed.

“These buses continue to run amok with unlicensed and unverified bus drivers behind the wheel,” it said, as the newspaper narrated how a senior executive of its ad department had died when a bus hit his motorcycle and ran him over.

Some recent ghastly accidents did not help the negative reputation of public transport drivers.

On April 3, a 22-year-old student, Rajib Hossain, had his right hand severed when it got stuck between two speeding buses, police said. He later died in hospital.

Eight days later, Runi Akter, a student who was in the final stages of her MBA degree, was rushing toward a road divider when a speeding bus ran over her, crushing her legs against the pavement, local reports said. She is still undergoing treatment at a hospital.

Untrained and unlicensed public transport drivers could be a big part of the dangers of venturing out onto the nation’s roadways, according to Mozammel Haque Chowdhury, secretary general of the Bangladesh Passenger Welfare Association (BPWA).

Chowdhury said his group had conducted a survey which found that of the estimated 7 million public transit drivers in Bangladesh, only 1.6 million had valid driving licenses. Transportation officials could not immediately confirm those figures.

But bus drivers like Jakir Hossain seethe at the notion that drivers bear the blame for the high number of accidents. Pedestrians should strictly follow the law, he said.

Kazi Md Saifun Newaz, an assistant professor at Buet’s Accident Research Institute (ARI), said that reckless driving was not the sole cause of the accidents.

Passengers riding on buses should be more responsible about not encouraging drivers to drive recklessly, and more pedestrian overpasses and crossings need to be built into the road system to improve safety, he told the Dhaka Tribune in April.

“We need more zebra crossings, barricades in the middle of the street, and the pedestrians should use foot-over bridges to strengthen the traffic control system,” he said.

Chowdhury, the BPWA secretary general, told BenarNews that around 1.5 million unregistered vehicles operate in Bangladesh in addition to the registered ones.

“This means there could be over three million legal and illegal vehicles being driven by unqualified drivers who are not only risking themselves, but putting a large number of people in peril,” he said.

Responding to criticism about the country’s road safety record, government officials have been coming out on a near daily basis with statements about how it is trying to reduce accidents and traffic fatalities by working to improve the roadways and traffic management systems.

During a press conference last month, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called, among other things, for the Bangladeshi media to help her government raise public awareness about national traffic laws in order to promote safer driving and bring down the number of road-related deaths.

“It is necessary to take steps to educate people in every school about the traffic laws,” Hasina said. “Only then can the accidents be reduced.”","Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/bengali/bus-drivers-06142018145009.html/180501_Road_Transport_Workers_1000.jpg/@@images/image,"['public', 'woes', 'dhaka', 'million', 'gridlock', 'drivers', 'accidents', 'workers', 'bus', 'stuck', 'traffic', 'transport', 'road', 'bangladeshi', 'told']",

Only 1,500 hectares (3,700 acres) of woods were planted in England last year, well below targets to increase woodland in the country, figures show.

It is above the lows seen in the previous two years, with new planting falling to as low as 800 hectares (2,000 acres) in England in 2016, the data from the Forestry Commission reveals.

But campaigners warned the figure was far below the 5,000 hectares a year needed to increase England's woodland cover to 12 per cent by 2060, an ambition set out by the Government in the wake of the failed public forest sell-off.

Poor planting rates, woodland losses and weak protection of ancient woods means that England is likely to be experiencing net deforestation, with areas felled or destroyed and not replanted, the Woodland Trust warned.

Woodlands cover just 10 per cent of England, but they are important strongholds for native broadleaf trees which are rich in wildlife.

Since the plans to increase cover were announced six years ago less than half the necessary level of woodland planting has been achieved.

John Tucker, director of woodland creation, Woodland Trust, said: ""These figures are all the more shocking considering the growing evidence of the importance of trees and woods in tackling air pollution, improving water quality and offering scope to deliver natural flood management, not to mention what they offer for wildlife and their productive potential for the rural economy.

""Something is drastically wrong with the way various government departments that share responsibility for trees and woods are failing to get enough new woodland created.""

He said: ""Poor planting rates, woodland losses, and weak protection of ancient woods mean that in England, we are highly likely to be in a state of net deforestation, with some areas of woodland canopy felled or destroyed and not replanted.

""Despite repeated requests there is little sign of government effort to accurately quantify the cumulative losses of woodland resulting from planning, infrastructure, tree disease and intensive land use.""

The Woodland Trust is calling for more flexible programmes to provide grants to both smaller and larger areas of woodland creation and attract a wider range of landowners willing to plant.

In the UK as a whole in 2017-2018 there was 9,100 hectares (22,500 acres) of new planting, around half of which was conifer forest in Scotland, the figures show.

A Government spokesman said: ""Trees are a precious natural asset and we recognise we need to go further - and faster - to grow woodland cover. In the last six months alone, we've published an ambitious 25 Year Environment Plan, kick-started the creation of a vast Northern Forest and appointed a Tree Champion to drive this forward.

""We have also made it easier for landowners to apply for our grant schemes - and since 2015, both applications received and the number of trees planted has almost doubled. We will continue to work with farmers, stakeholders and local authorities to build on the progress we've made.""

His wife Hawa told doctors that they wanted medicinal treatment as dialysis would cost them Tk 7,000 a month on average.

“I collected Tk 20,000 from my neighbours to come to Dhaka and almost the total amount has been spent. Earlier, I spent all my savings in a cooperative for his treatment. How can I go for dialysis?” said Hawa at Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital.

Asad, aged about 55, is a van driver and his wife a domestic help. With their collective income, the couple used to run their six-member family. With Asad suffering from kidney disease, the family is now financially worse off.

“I don't know how I will run the family. What will happen to my schoolgoing children?” she said on Tuesday.

Like Asad, some eight lakh people in Bangladesh are suffering from kidney failure. The patients either need dialysis or kidney transplant -- both expensive treatment options.

Similar is the case for those suffering from chronic diseases like cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, diabetes and injuries that need long-term treatments. As such treatments are expensive, these leave the poor in financial hardship. According to Bangladesh National Health Accounts 1997-2015, out of pocket (OOP) health expenditure (private spending) in Bangladesh is 67 percent, which is more than double the global average of 32 percent.

A study by the ICDDR,B found that the OOP health expenditure pushes four to five million Bangladeshis like Asad into poverty every year. In his budget speech, Finance Minister AMA Muhith did not mention any specific plan to address the high expenditure issue. He spoke of building new hospitals, medical colleges and recruitment of doctors, nurses and midwives. He proposed allocating Tk 23,383 crore for the health sector, up by Tk 2,704 crore from that of the current fiscal year.

However, compared to the total budget, its share has decreased from current year's 5.39 percent to 5 percent next year.

Out of Tk 23,383 crore, the annual development budget is Tk 9,041 crore and the rest is revenue budget meant for salaries and benefits of public servants.

Dr Rashid E Mahbub, chairman of National Health Rights Movement, said the health budget for the next fiscal year was much lower as the World Health Organisation recommends it to be 15 percent of the total budget.

The question, however, is how the money is going to be utilised. “Will the hospital management be better? Will the private sector be better regulated?” Rashid said.

“Will the hospital management be better? Will the private sector be better regulated?” Rashid said. He said the government proposed reducing import duty on raw materials for some medicines, but the people won't be benefitted from this measure unless the price of medicine is regulated.

“With the cost of all healthcare services growing, it is very likely that the out of pocket health expenditure would go up,” said Rashid. Mahbub Elahi Chowdhury, acting head of Universal Health Coverage Programme at the ICDDR,B, said Bangladesh has a good healthcare infrastructure up to the village level. There are also a good number of doctors, he said.

“However, human resource management remains a major problem. Many doctors posted at the rural areas remain absent. Also, many at the public hospitals don't work full-time. It is a question of accountability,” he told this correspondent. Even if the government has the drugs and logistics, the healthcare services cannot be reached to the people if health personnel do not play their due role, said Mahbub.

The government has been talking about health insurance for all for long, and a pilot scheme is running in three upazilas of Tangail for around three years. However, the authorities concerned are still struggling to prove it as a model, he added.

According to official sources, crop in an extent of 45.79 ha have been lost in the flood. Epidemic threat looms large over many parts of upper Kuttanad.

Water-borne diseases like jaundice have already been traced in these areas. Mundappally SC colony, Kazhuppil colony, and Chakkulathu colony, also remains isolated. Kerala State Electricity Board sources told The Hindu that Kakki, Anathode and Pampa reservoirs of the Sabarigiri hydro-electric project received heavy inflow from the catchment areas in the past one week.","Wed, 13 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/e2k64v/article24156875.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvpt-raft1,"['areas', 'looms', 'submerged', 'sources', 'official', 'taluk', 'parts', 'threat', 'upper', 'colony', 'kuttanad', 'thiruvalla']",

In West Karbi Anglong, the Dongkamukam-Kheroni PWD road is reeling under flood water and the vehicular movement has come to a standstill for the last 12 hours. The people of Telohor area are having harrowing time in communicating through the road, particularly women and school students.

Artificial floods have occurred at several places where wooden bridges are being replaced by RCC bridges but the projects are still not completed.

One such place is Telohor on the Dongkamokam-Kheroni road. Although the vehicular communication is completely cut off, people are seen crossing the under-construction RCC bridge by means of temporary bamboo scaffolding constructed by someone.

Women with babies in their arms, men with school-going children on their back and carrying burdens were seen dangerously crossing the under-construction RCC bridge over Telohor rivulet on the Dongkamokam-Kheroni PWD road. The commuters also vent their anger on the authority for not completing the bridge for the last several years.

People communicating on the NEC road in West Karbi Anglong are also facing a lot of problems due to non-completion of the road. There are several stretches in the road where artificial floods have occurred.

In Karbi Anglong district, the plain areas under Langpher MAC (Member of Autonomous Council) constituency have been flooded due to continuous rains in the last 60 hours. Many stretches of the road have been flooded due to which people are having problems in communication.

The road at Bahoni Adarsha to Teteliguri and Konjuk Athoi is also reeling under flood water and an under-construction subway culvert has been washed away at Bahoni Adarsha. Flood waters have entered many houses in Balijan area of Bakaliaghat town.

Bhuin Bali Bidyakshetra, a school in the locality, has remained shut due to flood.

44,44,FL-2018-000070-BGD,Lloyd’s Index Shows $92B at Risk in North American Cities Each Year - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2018/06/06/491337.htm,"Cities in the U.S. and Canada stand to lose $92.96 billion per year to risks like market crash, cyber attack and flood, an index from Lloyd’s released today shows.

Lloyd’s newly issued City Risk Index, which produces estimates of how much savings are needed to deal with anticipated risks, shows that North American cities lead global rankings for technology and space threats, and are critically exposed to financial loss through extreme climate.

The report also shows North American cities could save $2.9 billion each year by improving their levels of resilience.

New York City is ranked second in the world in GDP@Risk, and should expect to lose $14.83 billion to risk each year, topping the world in risks including market crash, flood, cyber attack and human pandemic.

GDP@Risk is an expected loss figure that is a projection based on the likelihood of the loss of economic output from the threat.

The index measures the GDP@Risk of 279 cities across the world from 22 threats in five categories: finance; economics and trade; geopolitics and security; health and humanity; natural catastrophe and climate; and technology and space. Those listed in the index are some of the world’s leading cities, collectively generating 41 percent of global GDP.

The latest index shows how much it would cost a city annually from rare risk events, like an earthquake, that might only take place once every few years, or from more frequently occurring events like cyber attacks.

Cyber is becoming more frequent and poses ever greater threats, but not too many entities are insured for these events, according to Trevor Maynard, head of innovation at Lloyd’s.

“We’ve done quite a bit of research on cyber recently, and published a few reports on that subject, and they show very significant under insurance in cyber,” Maynard said. “You know, maybe only 10 or 20 percent of businesses have cyber coverages, so we definitely would say that people are not as prepared for cyber as they would be for some other risks.”

Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty in a report in March also concluded that small- and medium-sized enterprises underestimate their cyber exposures, but that some of them are waking up to the realities of cyber risks.

Market crash is the costliest risk listed in the index for more than two-thirds of North American cities with a combined cost of $19.9 billion. This is because the economies of U.S. cities are heavily reliant on private capital, which means should any disruption take place, they stand to lose.

In North America, the leading risks after market crash ($19.90 billion) are cyber attack ($14.73 billion) and flood ($13.17 billion).

The index shows that $546.50 billion is globally at risk each year from all 22 threats. The largest global threats are: market crash ($103.33 billion); interstate conflict ($80.00 billion); and tropical windstorm ($62.58 billion).

Manmade threats worldwide account for 59 percent of the total GDP@Risk and climate-related risks account for $122.98 billion of lost GDP.

Tokyo leads stands to lose the most GDP through risk. Tokyo’s GDP@Risk is measured at $24.31 billion. New York ($14.83 billion), and Manila ($13.27 billion) follows.

Other U.S. cities near the top of this risk index include Los Angeles ($11.56 billion), Chicago ($5.72 billion), Houston ($4.98 billion) and San Francisco ($4.57 billion).

Thirty-four cities in North America – 28 in the U.S. and six in Canada – account for 17 percent of the global GDP@Risk total. The GDP@Risk in those cities amounts to a collective $92.96 billion each year from all 22 threats.

Forty-four percent of North America’s exposure comes from natural causes, and 56 percent is from manmade risks. Climate threats account for just over 20 percent, according to the index.

Climate change is listed as a chief threat in the index for cities including New York, with the biggest perils including flood, heatwave and freeze.

“Climate change will have an increasing impact on the U.S. economy,” the index report says, noting that the global sea-level rise of 20cm since the 1950s contributed to an increase in New York’s insured losses of $20 billion to $25 billion from Superstorm Sandy by 30 percent. A report from the World Meteorological Organization released in 2016 showed Earth experienced its hottest half-decade on record between 2011 and 2015, and it indicated that the severity of Sandy may have been a result of that.

Chicago’s risk profile resembles New York’s. The three costliest threats to Chicago’s GDP are market crash ($1.22 billion), flood ($0.97 billion) and cyberattack ($0.92 billion).

In Los Angeles water from storms as well as lack of water pose a combined threat of $2.43 billion to GDP, while earthquake is a threat to the city to the tune of $2.70 billion annually, according to the index.

Maynard noted that the index gives expected long-run averages, and that anticipated GDP hits on each city should be viewed in context.

“If you look at Los Angeles for example, the GDP at risk from earthquake is $2.7 billion, which actually is not a very large number,” he said. “It probably sounds large, but in the context of the L.A. economy, it isn’t. But actually, an extreme earthquake, if it happened in L.A., could cost around $380 billion, and an average-sized earthquake would be around $117 billion.”

Users of the risk index can run scenario losses and see the forecast cost of an event happened in a given year.

“And those numbers are much larger than the long-term average costs, which are a savings rate,” Maynard said. “And they really make the case for risk transfer because, you know, the point is that if you put aside a little bit each year, or you buy insurance, then you can be prepared for those really large losses when they finally arrive, and they’re bound to arrive at some point.”

MADIKERI: While rainfall subsides in central and north Kodagu, heavy, continuous rains lash south Kodagu, flooding Makutta completely.

A lorry-loader, Sharath (24) was washed off in the flood in Makutta, Kodagu border. The deceased went missing on Tuesday night, last seen loading stones to a lorry at Makutta. The police on Wednesday evening found his dead body, washed off 1.5 km downhill at Makutta. His body has been kept at Virajpet mortuary and will be retrieved by Lorry Association members.

Over five hotels, some dating back to pre-independence era, have been completely destroyed, following heavy downpour. Many houses in the area have collapsed by the flooded waters. A government Malayali school in Makutta is on the verge of complete destruction.

Kerala police, Virajpet police, fire tenders and forest officials were involved in relief and rescue operation in the border area of Kerala-Kodagu. Makutta-Thalaserry Highway has been cut off completely following flood after Makutta recorded over ten inches of rainfall in the past 24 hours. “Between 500 and 1000 trees seem to have uprooted in the region,” confirmed wildlife official Sudhakar. The residents of Makutta are terrified after heavy rains that have lashed the town brutally, last of this kind being reportedly witnessed nearly 5 decades ago.

While the rest of the district is witnessing decreased rainfall, the aftermath of heavy rains continues to haunt the people. Many villages in the district are suffering without electricity for over a week now. “CESCOM has incurred a loss of over 53.17 lakh,” confirmed B Somashekar, district executive engineer. Over 300 linemen have been working simultaneously to fix the power lines, yet the work seems never ending as many transformers are dysfunctional and lot more electric poles have been uprooted. Two cattle died of electrocution in Somwarpet taluk.

Many farms in Virajpet taluk have been flooded with water incurring huge crop loss. A lorry was stuck in slush by the roadside on Nadikeri turn near Gonikoppal blocking traffic for over two hours.

In the past one-and-a-half years, the Supreme Court has witnessed 21 cases where petitioners have sought the court’s permission to terminate pregnancy, while the High Courts have seen 53 cases (16 in the Bombay High Court alone) despite the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act allowing it. The act dates back to 1971.

Advocate Anubha Rastogi, practising at the Bombay HC told The Hindu, “The problem is that at the ground level, the understanding is that you can’t perform a termination till you get court permission, which is incorrect. There have been cases where women come to court even if they are pregnant for eight weeks or 12 weeks, which is ridiculous.”

Ms. Rastogi said the piling up of such cases was cause for concern, especially since the courts have also not asked petitioners why they have approached them.

She said, “The courts are entertaining these cases and passing judgements. While these are positive judgements as far as the interpretation of the law is concerned, the message that is being communicated to doctors and women is that you have to go to court.”

Ms. Rastogi was speaking at a discussion on, ‘How to ensure reproductive justice in India’, where Dr. Nozer Sheriar, former secretary general at the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India, Dr. Suchitra Dalvie, coordinator, Asia Safe Abortion Partnership, Anubha Bhonsle, former executive editor, CNN-News 18, Kalpana Sharma, senior journalist and Dr. Indira Behara, Senior Director, Global Health Strategies were present.

The primary objective of the workshop was to have a holistic understanding of abortions and how it is a life-saving service. Abortion in India is legal but is among the top three causes of maternal mortality. Moreover, society still looks down upon it. What was also discussed is that India does not have more than 50,000 gynaecologists but around 15.6 million abortions have occurred in 2015 alone.

Ms. Sharma said, “India is still a conservative society and this is a progressive law which was brought in partly because abortion is a part of family planning, the person who pushed it could be the who thought that sterilisation and abortion could be part of family planning package in the late 1960 and therefore it came in 1971. Ultimately the woman will be blamed either she has a miscarriage or she asserts her right to decide whether she wants to have the child or no thirdly also if she gives birth to a girl child, in every way the woman is blamed to make decisions about her reproductive functions.”","Fri, 08 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/syeeg9/article22403872.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/abortion,"['woman', 'flood', 'courts', 'law', 'india', 'appeals', 'permits', 'abortions', 'cases', 'women', 'court', 'abortion', 'permission', 'rastogi', 'dr']",

Since 2015, the world has witnessed a rapid increase in the number of new border fences being constructed in a short span. Over the last three years alone, a staggering 63 new border fences have been constructed or are in the process of being constructed.

The once borderless Schengen zone now has border fences erected between member states and stringent border controls within the European Union. The divisive Brexit vote, based largely on the fear of immigrants, has altogether altered the very shape of Fortress Europe, giving rise to new questions about Britain’s borders and immigration policies as well as the very idea of Europe.

Across the Atlantic, the cacophonous chants to ‘build that wall’ between the United States and Mexico have materialised into the Muslim ban and atrocious border wall prototyping, and most recently, the brutal policy of separating immigrant children and families.

Closer home, in South Asia, the pernicious Rohingya genocide has led to the creation of the largest refugee camp in Cox Bazaar, Bangladesh. Adding to this, border violence between India and Pakistan reached an all-time high in 2017 with the highest number of incidences of border violence.

These illustrations underline the fact that the once popular notion at the turn of the 21st century of a globalised and borderless world has come into question.

Reinstated, redrawn, and rebuilt

Today, borders are being reinstated, redrawn, and rebuilt. In remote villages that have shared culture, languages and relations, the monstrosity of concertina wire, tall fences or border walls are dividing two sides. The recently completed border between Turkey and Syria boasts of “an electronic layer [which] consists of close-up surveillance systems, thermal cameras, land surveillance radar, remote-controlled weapons systems, command-and-control centres, line-length imaging systems and seismic and acoustic sensors. Furthermore, the advanced technology layer of the project includes wide area surveillance, laser destructive fiber-optic detection, surveillance radar for drone detection, jammers and sensor-triggered short distance lighting systems”.

Border technology, the development of newer forms of surveillance whether that includes drones and thermal imaging devices, or even the growing number of ‘volunteers’ patrolling the borders between the US and Mexico for instance, are indicative of this growing industry of division.

However, if we are to critically examine what shapes the current border politics and thinking, it is vital to ask a few questions. What makes borders desirable? In a world that is arguably so digitally and economically connected, where goods, services and finance travel so freely, why is it so hard for humans to move?

To address these issues, one cannot ignore the impact of 9/11 and terrorism on global security practices. That said, the shift from traditional forms of violence to more dispersed forms of attacks like 26/11 attack in Mumbai and more recently, the Paris attacks in 2015 have displaced fears from the distant border to the nation’s heartland. It has infused security practices into our daily lives. Things like airport-like security at cinema halls, malls, and hotels. X-ray baggage screening and body checks have become mundane rituals of urban life in India.

These changes have also influenced the ways in which border studies too has interpreted the border as a concept. The traditional notion of the border, understood as a line in the sand located at the territorial limits of the nation-state, has been increasingly challenged.

For instance, scholars like Étienne Balibar and Nick Vaughan-Williams argue that borders have not only vacillated, but are also no longer where they used to be. Thinking of borders as verbs and not nouns, the emphasis from borders to bordering has brought to light new locations, practices, and actors. Borders are also practiced and enlivened at airports, train-stations, detention centres, visa forms, border-towns and complex algorithms that profile individuals.

More so, borders are increasingly practiced and performed daily, this pervasiveness of the notion of the border is both intriguing and perverse. For instance, individuals in towns and cities within 100 miles of the border can be subjected to random border checks and forced to produce their legal documents 100 miles inside the United States’ territory. Thereby, this dislodges the border from the border line to the border-town.

The recent Windrush scandal in the UK questions the legitimacy of its Caribbean immigrant descendants and their legitimacy in British society. This issue has successfully pulled the border from the periphery to the centre, but also raised questions about identity and citizenship in Brexit Britain. Furthermore, the everyday bordering of international students at British universities is also demonstrative of the new role of academics performing duties of border guards. In a sense, the question of where the border is located is also being transformed into who is performing these roles.

Lines of control

In terms of understandings India’s relationship with its borders, it is first important to locate India’s border thinking within its historical and political contexts. Historically speaking, the conflation of borders as a problem for postcolonial India can be linked with Partition and the ongoing territorial dispute over Kashmir.

While the inevitable association of borders in South Asia with the Partition, wars, and mortality cannot be done away with, it is equally necessary to move beyond these congenital associations. Since the teleological link between the creation of the postcolonial nation states is seen in relation to bloody partitions, be it in 1947 when India was divided to create East and West Pakistan, or in 1971, when West Pakistan lost East Pakistan to the creation of Bangladesh.

The notion of territorial loss is deeply engrained in the breaking and forming of nations, identity and political states in South Asia.In a way, the historical burden of this has also led to an overly nationalist understanding of the nation whereby territory is sacralised into blood and soil. More notably, the notion of Bharat Mata or the anthropomorphic distortion of India as Mother India renders the borders of the state as highly emotional and evocative issues.

Border scholar Jason Cons defines India’s borders as ‘sensitive spaces’, where he explains sensitivity in terms of both political sensitivity as well as places that are associated with unexplainable fear and anxiety.

This sensitivity, or what Sankaran Krishna defines as cartographic anxiety typical of a postcolonial nation, state runs deep in psyches of the state, polity and people. Whether one considers the hypersensitivity to maps and the depiction of India’s borders in foreign publications like the Economist, the capturing of alleged Pakistani spy-pigeons, or the fact that India’s borders with Pakistan are not only electrocuted and flood-lit but are also visible even from space, elucidate the extent of border fixation and anxiety.

In many ways, the physical unfixity of the Line of Control between India and Pakistan is what has rendered this border-line fixed in the minds of politicians and citizens alike whereby the borders of Bollywood and cricket remain firmly outlined for Pakistanis.

Borders of postcolonial India too are not limited to their territorial location and material articulation but today are subtly articulated through the increasingly exclusionary narratives of the nation sifting through those who belong and those who do not. The unofficial housing apartheid that occurs in urban spaces against minority religious communities, the notion of chhota-Pakistans in cities, or the bogey of ‘Love Jihad’, and attacks on ‘anti-nationals’ consistently outline stereotypes, prejudice and everyday forms of bordering.

Although they lack the infrastructure of fences and guards, they still perpetuate invisible fences of difference and division.

Artificial logjams are a popular but controversial restoration tool - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/06/beaver-dams-without-beavers-artificial-logjams-are-popular-controversial-restoration,"Beaver dams without beavers? Artificial logjams are a popular but controversial restoration tool

SCOTT VALLEY, CALIFORNIA—In 1836, an explorer named Stephen Meek wandered down the piney slopes of Northern California's Klamath Mountains and ended up here, in the finest fur trapping ground he'd ever encountered. This swampy basin would ultimately become known as the Scott Valley, but Meek's men named it Beaver Valley after its most salient resource: the rodents whose dams shaped its ponds, marshes, and meadows. Meek's crew caught 1800 beavers here in 1850 alone, shipping their pelts to Europe to be felted into waterproof hats. More trappers followed, and in 1929 one killed and skinned the valley's last known beaver.

The massacre spelled disaster not only for the beavers, but also for the Scott River's salmon, which once sheltered in beaver-built ponds and channels. As old beaver dams collapsed and washed away, wetlands dried up and streams carved into their beds. Gold mining destroyed more habitat. Today, the Scott resembles a postindustrial sacrifice zone, its once lush floodplain buried under heaps of mine tailings. ""This is what we call ‘completely hosed,’"" sighed Charnna Gilmore, executive director of the Scott River Watershed Council in Etna, California, as she crunched over the rubble on a sweltering June morning last year.

All is not lost, however. Beyond one slag heap, a tributary called Sugar Creek has been transformed into a shimmering pond, broad as several tennis courts and fringed with willow and alder. Gilmore tugged up her shorts and waded into the basin, sandals sinking deep into chocolatey mud. Schools of salmon fry flowed like mercury around her ankles. It was as if she had stepped into a time machine and been transported back to the Scott's fecund past.

This oasis, Gilmore explained, is the fruit of a seemingly quixotic effort to rebeaver Beaver Valley. At the downstream end of the pond stood the structure that made the resurrection possible: a rodent-human collaboration known as a beaver dam analog (BDA). Human hands felled and peeled Douglas fir logs, pounded them upright into the stream bed, and wove a lattice of willow sticks through the posts. A few beavers that had recently returned to the valley promptly took over, gnawing down nearby trees and reinforcing the dam with branches and mud.

""It's fantastic to see beavers working on this,"" Gilmore said as she bent to examine a chewed stick. ""They do a much better job than we do."" The result is a bit too orderly to be a beaver dam, a touch too messy to have been created solely by humans.

Gilmore's group is just one of many now deploying BDAs, perhaps the fastest-growing stream restoration technique in the U.S. West. Federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service, nonprofits such as The Nature Conservancy, and even private ranchers have installed the structures to return life to deeply eroded streams and, in some cases, to help re-establish beavers in long-abandoned territories. In Wyoming, BDAs are creating wet meadows for a vulnerable bird. In Oregon, they're rebuilding salmon streams. In Utah, they're helping irrigate pastures for cattle.

Part of the allure is that BDAs are cheap compared with other restoration techniques. ""Instead of spending $1 million per stream mile, maybe you spend $10,000,"" says Joe Wheaton, a geomorphologist at Utah State University (USU) in Logan who's among the leading proponents of beaver-based restoration. ""Relying on the labor of a rodent helps a ton.""

The BDA craze is experiencing growing pains, however. Regulators unfamiliar with the approach are sometimes skeptical, and some landowners and government agencies are loath to aid a rodent infamous for felling valuable trees, flooding property, and clogging road culverts. Last year alone, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) killed more than 23,000 beavers deemed to be nuisances.

Beavers might be vaunted ecosystem architects, says Joe Cannon, an ecologist at The Lands Council in Spokane, Washington, a group that has installed BDAs and relocated beavers in the eastern part of that state. ""But we've got greater protection on tree squirrels.""

From our 21st century vantage, it's hard to conceive how profoundly beavers shaped the landscape. Indeed, North America might better be termed Beaverland. Surveying the Missouri River Basin in 1805, the explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark encountered beaver dams ""extending as far up those streams as [we] could discover them."" Scientists calculate that up to 250 million beaver ponds once puddled the continent—impounding enough water to submerge Washington, Oregon, and California. Castor canadensis even paved the way for agriculture: By trapping sediment in their ponds, beavers ""produced the rich farm land … of the northern half of North America,"" paleontologist Rudolf Ruedemann wrote in Science in 1938.

But Beaverland could not withstand the fur trappers who arrived in New England in the 17th century and quickly spread west. By 1843, naturalist John James Audubon found the Missouri Basin ""quite destitute."" At the outset of the 20th century, researchers estimate, just 100,000 beavers survived—less than 1% of historic numbers.

The slaughter transfigured North America's waterways. In a healthy, beaver-rich creek, dams slow water flows, capture sediment, and counteract erosion. But after beavers and their speed bumps disappeared, streams eroded into their beds, cutting deep gullies in a process called incision. These steep-sided, straitjacketed streams lost the ability to spill onto their floodplains and recharge aquifers. Some groundwater-fed streams dried up altogether.

A stream comes back to life Across the U.S. West, scientists and land managers are using beaver dam analogs (BDAs) to heal damaged streams, re-establish beaver populations, and aid wildlife. In some cases, researchers have seen positive changes in just 1 to 3 years. Adding dams Beaver trapping and overgrazing have caused countless creeks to cut deep trenches and water tables to drop, drying floodplains. Installing BDAs can help. Widening the trench BDAs divert flows, causing streams to cut into banks, widening the incised channel, and creating a supply of sedi- ment that helps raise the stream bed. Beavers return As BDAs trap sediment, the stream bed rebuilds and forces water onto the floodplain, recharging groundwater. Slower flows allow beavers to recolonize. A complex haven Re-established beavers raise water tables, irrigate new stands of willow and alder, and create a maze of pools and side chan nels for fish and wildlife.

This tragic history played out along central Oregon's Bridge Creek, a 45-kilometer-long waterway that is the site of the country's most extensive BDA experiment. In the 1820s, U.K. operatives deliberately exterminated the region's beavers to dissuade U.S. trappers from invading the Oregon Territory, which was claimed at the time by both the United Kingdom and the United States. The gambit failed, but the beavers' destruction, combined with unchecked cattle grazing, left an enduring legacy. Bridge Creek devolved into a narrow trench bordered by desiccated pastures. ""It was kind of a godforsaken place,"" says Michael Pollock, an ecosystems analyst with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle, Washington.

Despite its grim appearance, Bridge Creek wasn't barren. The stream hosted a lingering population of endangered steelhead—rainbow trout that, like salmon, migrate to the ocean and back. A skeleton crew of beavers had also survived, although any dams they built across the sluicelike channel tended to wash away. But Pollock, who had studied the connection between beavers and salmon in Alaska, suspected that, if given a chance, the rodents could capture enough sediment to elevate Bridge Creek's bed, reconnect it with the floodplain, and inundate side channels and backwaters in which juvenile steelhead could thrive. In a 2007 study he found that even relatively short-lived beaver dams trapped significant amounts of sediment.

If a few collapsing dams were good, Pollock figured more stable ones would be better. So he decided to add some beaverlike structures of his own. To many salmon biologists, the experiment seemed the height of insanity: The dams, they warned, would bury key habitat in silt and expose still waters to the sun, making ponds too hot for young fish. ""Nobody really understood it,"" Pollock recalls with a laugh.

The scheme also posed logistical headaches. How could people, wielding tools instead of teeth, mimic nature's most talented builders? When Pollock and a colleague, USU ecologist Nick Bouwes, asked firms for artificial beaver dam designs, the prices came back at $50,000 per structure. ""I was appalled,"" Bouwes remembers. ""I'd just gotten done building a log home for that much.""

Bouwes combed the internet and found a thriftier alternative: a hydraulic post pounder, a machine that resembles a cross between a jackhammer and a bazooka. In 2009, the pair used their new toy to build 76 BDAs, fashioned from upright posts with willow branches woven between them, on 3.4 kilometers of Bridge Creek. They added 45 more between 2010 and 2012. ""My back still hurts,"" Pollock says.

The crew experimented with size and function. Some BDAs were meant to capture sediment, others to widen the channel by redirecting flows. The overarching goal was to convert a drastically simplified stream into a complex one.

Beavers soon lent a paw. ""Wherever we put structures, beavers came and set up shop,"" recalls Nick Weber, the project's coordinator who is based in Bend, Oregon. By 2013, beavers had fortified nearly 60 BDAs and built 115 new dams, monitoring studies found. All told, Bridge Creek's beaver activity increased eightfold. Some dams captured so much sediment that they became interred in muck. And, like a plant seeking sunlight, the stream bed began climbing out of its trench, spilling water onto floodplains. The creek's submerged area tripled and side channels grew by more than 1200%. ""Habitat changes that we thought would take a decade happened in 1 to 3 years,"" Bouwes says.

Steelhead soon took advantage. Bridge Creek produced nearly three times more fish than a nearby control stream, and its young steelhead were 52% more likely to survive, the researchers reported in 2016 in Scientific Reports. Other studies found the dams and ponds actually helped blunt water temperature spikes, perhaps by allowing water to percolate underground and cool.

As word spread about Bridge Creek, observers realized BDAs might help more than fish. Jeremy Maestas, an ecologist with USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service in Portland, Oregon, visited the site in 2015 and recognized potential benefits for the greater sage grouse, a ground-nesting bird that is the focus of a major conservation effort. It relies on wetlands and wet meadows for summer forage. Maestas became a BDA evangelist, leading workshops across the western United States. ""We're gaining traction all over,"" he says.

Some ranchers have also embraced beaver-based restoration. Jay Wilde, a rancher based in Mink Creek, Idaho, spent years trying to restore perennial flow to Birch Creek, a seasonal stream on his land. But it wasn't until he hit on beavers that he saw results. In 2015, he invited scientists at USU to build 19 BDAs on the creek and release five beavers nearby; the following summer the stream stayed wet 2 months longer than usual, helping irrigate grazing meadows. Although Wilde, a gruff, tobacco-chewing cattleman, didn't grow up a beaver lover, he's become a staunch advocate, even lecturing at local universities about the project's success. ""Now, I'll put in an earring and grow a ponytail if that's what it takes to get the message out.""

For all that momentum, however, BDAs continue to hit snags. Building a structure in a stream typically requires a federal or state permit, but many regulators simply don't know what to make of structures that are neither natural nor entirely human-built. John Coffman, manager of The Nature Conservancy's Red Canyon Ranch near Lander, Wyoming, learned that the hard way when he asked to install 10 BDAs along the Little Popo Agie River in 2017. The project stalled for a year after state officials required him to obtain the legal right to use the water that would be stored behind the BDAs—despite the fact that the semipermeable dams were designed only to delay, not stop, the water from flowing downstream to other users. Although Coffman eventually secured his water rights and built his BDAs, the state forbade structures that exceeded the stream's width or bank height, diminishing their ability to spread water onto the floodplain.

In some places, BDA skepticism has deep historical roots. Some river restoration engineers, for instance, fear the structures are the second coming of the so-called check dams that the U.S. Forest Service once built by the thousands to help curb erosion. Many of the rock dams ended up failing and doing more harm than good by encouraging problematic erosion and littering stream beds with debris.

BDA proponents downplay such concerns. Check dams were intended to be permanent, they note, whereas BDAs are inherently ephemeral. At Bridge Creek, for example, many structures have rapidly fallen into disrepair—which is fine. ""It's not about how long the structures last,"" Wheaton says. ""It's about getting beavers back in the system and letting them do the work.""

But he concedes that the chaos beavers breed—dams can flood roads, for instance—is not easily reconciled with civilization. In Utah, regulators have denied permits for BDAs amid fears that the structures would alter streams too radically—which, of course, is the whole point. ""Beavers seem like a slam dunk,"" says USU geomorphologist Wally Macfarlane, ""but we're getting our shots blocked all the time.""

Beaver skepticism has even undermined the pioneering Bridge Creek experiment. In 2017, the federal Bonneville Power Administration pulled its funding from the project after at least one member of the agency's council questioned whether documenting ""the value of beavers"" was worth the cost of monitoring. The move has cast doubt on the future of the site's research program. ""There's so much about this system we're just starting to understand,"" one researcher laments.

Perhaps no place is as ambivalent about beavers as California, where the Department of Fish and Wildlife once claimed—despite ample evidence to the contrary—that the animals were not native to much of the state. Although officials now acknowledge that beavers belong, they've been reluctant to encourage an animal notorious for meddling with the irrigation infrastructure that supports California's agricultural economy. That apprehension has, at times, confounded restoration efforts. In the Scott Valley, for example, the watershed council originally proposed building 36 BDAs, but regulators permitted just six.

Even here, however, the rodent revolution is gaining allies. Last year, state officials showed signs of warming to BDAs after the council invited them to a workshop. And once-suspicious local ranchers have shifted their views, persuaded in part by water tables that have risen by as much as a meter, helping improve water supplies and reduce irrigation costs.

Even 5 years ago, says Gilmore, her colleagues ""were like closet beaver people,"" so fearful of antibeaver sentiment that they wouldn't so much as wear T-shirts decorated with the rodent's portrait. Her group even dubbed BDAs ""post-assisted wood structures"" to avoid associations with the controversial animal. Today? ""We have a lot of landowners that would love for us to put [BDAs] up,"" she says. ""Now, people see me in town and they're like: ‘Oh, you're the beaver gal!’""","Thu, 07 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/ma_0608_Beavers_river.png?itok=-qAlqKbi,"['stream', 'bridge', 'bdas', 'structures', 'dams', 'logjams', 'beavers', 'artificial', 'water', 'tool', 'controversial', 'restoration', 'popular', 'beaver', 'streams', 'creek']",

The Border Security Force (BSF) in Tripura is planning to install laser walls at the unfenced riverine patches along India-Bangladesh border in Tripura. This is done to check infiltration bids.

Security forces have so far been using sensor devices, flood lights and night vision goggles to guard the international border. The laser walls would further help in plugging gaps and check infiltration bid in the ""vulnerable"" areas, a senior officer of BSF's Tripura Frontier said.

""We want to install laser walls to ensure effective border management along the Indo-Bangla border, but nothing has been finalized as yet,"" he said.

A similar project is on the verge of completion in Dhubri in Assam.

""Once the project is successfully implemented at Dhubri, the BSF higher-ups will assess its utility and decide if the model could be replicated in Tripura,"" he explained.

A real-time communication system, in coordination with Bhaskaracharya Institute for Space Applications and Geo-information (BISAG), has also been introduced in the state for smooth coordination with the senior officers.

""The satellite-integrated BISAG programme facilitates DG BSF to directly interact with the jawans deployed along the border areas. With this, the troops can hold discussions and address queries for better understanding of issues,"" the officer stated.

Of the total 856-km-long India-Bangladesh border in Tripura, the Centre had approved fencing for 840- km stretch.

While 750-km borderline has been sealed, isolated patches - mainly in Sepahijala district's Sonamura subdivision - remain unfenced, the officer added.

Status symbol

In 2015, Pavel Lobkov, a news anchor on TV Rain, an independent station in Moscow, confronted a predicament unlike any he had faced in more than 2 decades working as a journalist. It was World AIDS Day, and he was slated to host a show. His guest was the head of the Federal Center for the Prevention and Control of the Spread of AIDS, Vadim Pokrovsky. For 12 years, Lobkov had been Pokrovsky’s patient.

Lobkov had never spoken publicly about his HIV status. No well-known person in Russia ever had—Russia had no Magic Johnson. He asked a close friend for advice, who said to either call in sick or reveal his status. Lobkov switched off his cellphone. “Otherwise, I can call a second friend, a third friend, and somebody would distract me from doing this,” he says.

Lobkov opened the show, Hard Day’s Night, by explaining that Pokrovsky was more than a guest. “You are the one I came to with my trouble in 2003,” he said, recounting the heartless way another doctor told him his diagnosis. His on-air revelation made headlines, even in the United States. And the fact that he was then nearly 50 and didn’t have spots on his cheek, look exhausted, or show any signs that he was infected sent an important message to Russians, he says: You can live a normal life with HIV. Pokrovsky’s AIDS center saw a jump in people coming in for HIV tests, and Lobkov received a flood of questions on social media seeking his advice.

Why did it take until 2015 for a prominent Russian to finally reveal that he was living with HIV? “We are still Soviet,” Lobkov says. “And we are still trying to keep our problems inside us.”

Poster couple

Last year, on the streets of St. Petersburg, a poster appeared, featuring an attractive young man and woman looking into each other’s eyes. “People with HIV are just like you and me,” it read. It was part of a provocative campaign to encourage HIV testing in a country where the infection is still highly stigmatized. In an extra twist, the woman, Tatiana Vinogradova, is the prominent deputy director of the city’s AIDS center, and the man, Andrey Skvortsov, who is living with the virus, is her husband.

They decided to do the poster, says Skvortsov, who runs a nongovernmental organization called Patients in Control, “to do the maximum we could” for both the patient community and public health. “I try to motivate people, I’m an example,” says Skvortsov, who was diagnosed in 1997 with an HIV-ravaged immune system and today, thanks to antiretrovirals (ARVs), is healthy.

Vinogradova had another goal as well: to reduce bias and fear within the health care community. “I have a lot of friends who are doctors because we studied together at university, and they are still afraid of HIV patients,” says Vinogradova, whose mother once ran the city’s AIDS center and whose grandmother diagnosed the city’s first HIV case. “They’re not afraid of TB [tuberculosis]. They’re not afraid of hepatitis C. In the late ’80s, AIDS was the plague of the 20th century and it’s still in their heads.”

That stigma hit home 3 years ago, she says, when Skvortsov broke his collarbone in a bicycle accident. As a surgeon described the operation needed to repair his fracture, the couple told him that Skvortsov was living with HIV. Vinogradova offered to bring his medical records to show that he was on ARVs, that the virus was undetectable in his blood, and that his immune system was normal. The surgeon left the room, and when he came back, he said Skvortsov needed only a sling. They went to another hospital, where a surgeon had no concern about Skvortsov’s HIV status and scheduled the operation for the next day.

Skvortsov and Vinogradova feel the situation is improving, if slowly, because the increasing severity of the epidemic has rattled complacent officials, and a new generation of doctors and activists understands the disease and what needs to be done. But they believe the situation will have to become bleaker before the epidemic receives the urgent, full-force response that’s needed. “We have to be facing something terrible, and then there will be change,” Skvortsov says. “It’s the Russian mentality.”

The pill exchange

In 2012, when Alexander Chebin was dying from AIDS, he met a Pentecostal bishop who persuaded him to seek care and start taking antiretrovirals (ARVs). Chebin, who had served time in prison for a heroin-related offense and did not believe that HIV causes AIDS, realized “it was time to change not only my mind, but my faith.” Now a pastor himself, Chebin is part of an informal network of activists in seven Russian cities who give other people with HIV hope through what they call a “reserve pharmacy.”

People who can’t access ARVs, mainly because government clinics have run out, post their problems on social media sites that Chebin and other activists monitor. Some people use private chats on Facebook, but many others post to a public website called pereboi.ru that is run by Patients in Control, “a movement of people living with HIV and other socially significant diseases.” Chebin and other like-minded activists, or “consultants,” in turn distribute ARVs to people in need in their areas.

At his home, Chebin keeps a large stock of ARVs donated by people who have switched drugs or by relatives of people who have died. He also swaps ARVs through the informal network with activists such as Yulia Vereschagina, who lives in St. Petersburg and keeps her own large stash of medicine in a cabinet under her TV. Vereschagina, a consultant with pereboi.ru, says she filled 600 requests between March and November 2017, sending 140 packages to Chebin and suppliers in other cities.

Vereschagina got involved with the network in March 2017, when she had side effects from her own ARVs and her clinic said it could not take back the pills that she wanted to return. She says people ask for help not only because of drug shortages, but also because the official process of registering for treatment can take months and is sometimes impossible. “Until the situation with the medication improves, I’m often the only source,” she says. “There’s always a shortage somewhere.”

The loyal opposition

Vadim Pokrovsky, head of the Federal Center for the Prevention and Control of the Spread of AIDS in Moscow, is—to borrow from a Russian saying—deft enough to “shoe a flea”: He’s a top government official who speaks critically about its policies and yet keeps his job. “At the present moment, there are no real attempts to overcome the epidemic,” he says, noting that Russian President Vladimir Putin has not mentioned HIV/AIDS in a decade. “We need something new.”

Pokrovsky’s to-do list runs long. The government now spends 24 billion rubles (about $400 million) on HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, a sum he thinks should be quadrupled. He dismisses the government’s boast that it has expanded testing to some 32 million people each year. “Who was tested?” he asks. “Old women and children.” The conservative Russian Orthodox Church, he complains, has stifled sex education and condom campaigns. “I think it’s better first to save the life and then to save the soul,” he says.

Gregory Vergus, the St. Petersburg–based regional coordinator of a nongovernmental organization, the International Treatment Preparedness Coalition in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, says Pokrovsky’s voice is essential because the entire system, from testing to delivering drugs, is badly broken. “Nobody in the government cares at every step of the way,” says Vergus, whose group advocates to make anti-HIV drugs more accessible in Russia. “He’s the only one.”

But other people question the extent of Pokrovsky’s commitment. One U.S. AIDS researcher sharply criticized Pokrovsky’s plenary talk in April at an HIV/AIDS conference in Moscow. “He addressed no modern preventive interventions beyond the era of the condom, did not speak to treatment as prevention, did not address the urgency around harm reduction, and did not address pre-exposure prophylaxis for those at risk,” says Chris Beyrer of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland. Beyrer says Pokrovsky may have held his tongue because the conference included many health officials from countries Russia wants to influence. “It was difficult not to come away with the take-home that the federal authorities were again refusing to take an evidence-based approach to the expanding HIV epidemic in Russia.”

Pokrovsky concedes his job is “rather difficult. … Every morning I say it’s necessary to quit this work if there are no results, no progress. But in the evening, I’m thinking about what problem to go after the next day.”

60,60,FL-2018-000070-BGD,"Read more: India's groundwater crisis, fueled by intense pumping, needs urgent management - Mong",https://india.mongabay.com/2018/06/indias-groundwater-crisis-fueled-by-intense-pumping-needs-urgent-management/,"Groundwater in northern and eastern India is undergoing severe depletion as measured by satellite data between 2002 and 2016, mainly due to intense extraction for crop irrigation.

Although rainfall over India is projected to rise under the “business as usual” scenario, it would be “too little too late” and may not help if it comes as extreme rainfall events, according to the researchers.

Curbing extensive groundwater withdrawals will require limiting agricultural electricity subsidies provided by state governments and rationing of power.

Other strategies include adopting more efficient irrigation techniques and training farmers on water conservation practices.

Agriculture has been the lifeline for millions of Indian farmers since the Green Revolution in the 1960s and groundwater has played a vital role in irrigating water-hungry crops such as rice to feed India’s ever-growing population.

But over the past three decades, India has been grappling with intense and rapid depletion of groundwater stores driven by human-caused climate change and over-extraction. The consequences can be far-reaching; water shortages can hit food supplies causing prices to soar and fueling social unrest, according to researchers.

Groundwater is the largest liquid source of freshwater which, along with soil moisture, surface waters such as lakes and rivers and snow and ice, comprises all the freshwater available on Earth.

Now, in a new first-of-its-kind global analysis on freshwater availability, northern and eastern India emerged as major hotspots of groundwater depletion mainly because of overexploitation for irrigation although eastern regions also faced low rainfall, while the central and southern regions showed stability owing to water policy changes and increased rainfall.

Amid rising temperatures and high greenhouse gas emissions, the study projects increasing rainfall over India by 2100. But past research suggests that the Indo-Gangetic Plains have been hit by more droughts due to climate change and better water management policies are urgently needed to tackle India’s groundwater woes.

“Groundwater in northern India is being depleted at a rate of 19.2 gigatons per year,” said Matthew Rodell, lead author of the paper and chief of the Hydrological Sciences Laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. This is equivalent to almost a third of the capacity of one of India’s largest reservoirs by water capacity, the Indira Sagar in Madhya Pradesh. “That is definitely a concern, because it is unsustainable,” he warned.

While monsoonal rainfall contributes to groundwater recharge as water seeps through the soil collecting deep underground in the gaps between rocks and layers of porous rock, known as aquifers, pumping out stored water lowers the water table. Unlike rivers or lakes, recharge of groundwater can take years.

Nowhere is groundwater more important than in India where a quarter of the world’s groundwater is extracted annually—the highest in the world—which is greater than that pumped up by China and the United States combined. Up to 80 percent of the population relies on groundwater for both drinking and irrigation. Although agriculture comprises only 17 percent of India’s Gross Domestic Product, it employs more than half of the workforce.

Declining stores in the north and east, stability in the south and central regions

Rodell’s team mapped global trends in freshwater availability over a 14-year period from 2002 to 2016 based on data obtained from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)—a pair of satellites launched in 2002.

Using information on precipitation, irrigation and groundwater pumping, the team analysed the reasons for the trends. In addition, they predicted changes in precipitation by 2100 under the IPCC (RCP8.5) “business as usual” scenario where greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise.

Despite receiving one percent higher than normal rainfall between 2003 and 2015, northern India experienced severe groundwater depletion primarily due to widespread overextraction for irrigation of crops like rice and wheat. The semi-arid northern region boasts the highest irrigated area (54 percent) among all 34 regions studied worldwide. While the study projects rainfall to increase by 12 percent by 2100, Rodell warned “it will be too little, too late.”

The eastern region also suffers from dwindling freshwater stores, due to groundwater extraction for agricultural irrigation and falling monsoonal precipitation. As this region has the third highest irrigated area (25 percent), the authors believe the falling trend is likely to continue. However, as rainfall is expected to spring back to normal levels and even forecast to rise by about 15 percent by 2100, the rate of groundwater decline is expected to be lower.

“More rainfall could mean more groundwater recharge and more water availability, but if that increasing rainfall is delivered in more severe storms, increased flooding may be a downside to greater precipitation,” noted James Famiglietti of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who is the co-author of the study.

Tushaar Shah, an economist and public policy specialist at the International Water Management Institute and former director at the Institute of Rural Management at Anand, Gujarat, agrees stating that if the predicted increase in rainfall “comes in fewer, more intense rainfall events, it will not be of much help in the more frequent dry spells.”

Central and southern India appear to be experiencing increasing freshwater stores, likely due to a naturally higher than normal rainfall.

Overexploitation and more frequent dry spells

“Although the trends in groundwater are confined to the northern part of India and into Bangladesh, it is really a national problem in the sense that, especially in northwestern India, that region grows food for the nation,” said Famiglietti.

In the states of Punjab and parts of Haryana in particular, extraction exceeds recharge from monsoonal rainfall, said Vimal Mishra who leads the Water and Climate Lab at the Indian Institute of Technology in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. “This is highly irreversible,” he said, because recharging groundwater levels back to normal in this region may take up to 50 years.

As groundwater systems are very slow in response, water stores recorded during 2002, for instance, may reflect rainfall changes going as far back as 10 to 15 years, explained Mishra. In 2017, his team reported another culprit contributing to plunging water tables: weaker monsoonal rainfall due to climate change. They noted a long-term decline in rainfall over parts of northern India since the 1950s such as in the Gangetic Plains, resulting in more frequent droughts. Rising sea surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean may be linked to this decline, they found.

This “has partially contributed to the decline in groundwater” due to lower recharge levels, he explained. And when monsoonal rainfall is lower, farmers rely more on groundwater, so extraction is higher, he stressed.

Indeed, “the situation would be worse with normal or low rainfall,” cautioned Rodell.

Limiting subsidised electricity

Shah and Mishra state that subsidised electricity provided by state governments is largely to blame for the over-extraction as farmers use it extensively to run pumps that draw up groundwater.

“Punjab, Haryana, Telangana and Tamil Nadu offer completely free power,” revealed Shah. Other states “have token charges” but they “remain uncollected.” While “Gujarat collects vigorously,” he explained, it “provides 80 percent subsidy on cost to serve.” “Telangana was always offering free power, but has now started to offer 24/7 free power,” he added.

What’s clear is that averting what the authors state as a ‘tragedy of the commons’ will require a host of sustainable water management policies starting with abolishing or restricting subsidised electricity.

“Punjab is waking up to the crisis but not due to water shortage but the fiscal burden of the power subsidies,” said Shah. “It is politically hard to stop power subsidies,” he acknowledged, but “it is easier to improve quality of power and then ration daily hours along a reliable schedule.”

Adopting more efficient irrigation techniques and boosting recharge

According to Mishra, the government should develop policies to determine which crops should be grown in which region according to the water availability, which “has not been the focus.” For instance, he said, Punjab has a semi-arid climate but it grows rice, which depletes groundwater and is “highly unsustainable.” “Ideally, rice is not the suitable crop there.”

Also, “the irrigation efficiencies are extremely low,” said Mishra. “The crops do not need all of the water pumped; they just need a small fraction of the water. We end up losing a lot of this water.” He suggests improving “irrigation efficiency by using other types of irrigation that can save water” and “reduce the pressure on groundwater systems.”

“The traditional flood irrigation in India accounts for huge water loss through evapotranspiration,” said Soumendra Bhanja, a postdoctoral fellow at Athabasca University in Canada. “This system could be replaced by drip irrigation or spray irrigation,” he suggested.

Mishra proposes the decentralisation of groundwater recharge. “Right now, it is neglected; no one cares how much recharge is happening in their own farm or fields during monsoon season. There must be a policy that makes sure that every farmer participates in the groundwater recharge mechanism also,” he elaborated.

Rodell also emphasises “educating people, especially farmers, about the importance of water conservation.”

“Gujarat was the only state which worried about long-term groundwater sustainability; Maharashtra, Telangana, Rajasthan are increasing investments in recharge, but a great deal more needs to be done,” said Shah.

Aquifer replenishment in the west and south

But there is hope. A 2017 study found that groundwater management strategies likely contributed to a marked reversal from decreasing groundwater storage during 1996 to 2002 in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh to replenishment from 2003 to 2014.

“In Gujarat, agricultural electricity usage had been reduced from 16 billion units to 10 billion units during 2001 to 2006,” said Bhanja who led the study. “The government undertook a policy to separate agricultural electrical connections from household connections and there was a fixed timing for agricultural electricity availability,” he explained.

“In Andhra Pradesh,” said Bhanja, “two major projects were undertaken by the Netherlands’ government and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations” where farmers were trained in sustainable groundwater-use practices. He also noted “an increase in surface water irrigation over the years.”

However, Mishra believes that the replenishment seen in southern India is primarily driven by the long-term increases in monsoonal rainfall. This is because the study used data from the Central Ground Water Board, which, he said, focuses on shallow groundwater tables. “But most of the pumping for irrigation happens from deep wells,” he points out.

Sustainable management of groundwater

We don’t know how much water is stored in the aquifers, said Famiglietti. “Once you know how much is there, extraction rates can be adjusted to sustain groundwater storage over a longer period of time,” he elaborated.

“Managing aquifer storage will become increasingly critical for us in the face of climate change,” urged Shah. By increasing recharge and limiting withdrawals we need to “make sure that aquifers are at least half-full before a dry spell,” he asserted.

“As of now,” said Shah “our hard rock aquifers become bone-dry before a dry spell; so we have no drought resilience.”

State Minister for Youth and Sports Biren Sikder declared his intention of opening a national cricket academy, dedicated to the women's side, while felicitating the Bangladesh women’s cricket team Monday. The Tigresses returned home Monday evening after defeating six-time Asia Cup champion India by three-wickets at Kinrara Oval in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Sunday to clinch the six-nation regional tournament.

Bangladesh women cricketers upon reaching Dhaka were directly taken to the felicitation programme held at a local hotel in Dhaka.

“The girls have made us proud by winning the Asia Cup for the country. The achievement is historic. The Bangladesh government has already done enough for the betterment of women in sports. On this proud day I would like to inform that the Sports Ministry with its own fund will develop a cricket academy dedicated to the women. The BCB will run the academy,” said Biren to the media Monday.

“(Monday), the programme has been arranged by the BCB but we should have another felicitation programme for the women’s team with the presence of the honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina once she returns to the country. The BCB has already announced bonus (of Tk2 crores) for the team but the government has its own plan to reward the girls. It shall be done during the felicitation programme arranged by the ministry,” the State Minister added.

63,63,FL-2018-000070-BGD,No cheers in tax measures - The Daily Star,https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/national-budget-2018-19-no-cheers-tax-measures-1588249,"Every year when the budget is placed in the parliament, Taufiq Hasan, a 35-year-old private sector employee, gets all worked up about which products and services he would have to pay more the following fiscal year.

He never had to worry about income tax as he earned less than the tax-free threshold since the day he started working for a printing firm.

Now, he will have to bother as his annual income would be more than Tk 2.50 lakh, and the government did not raise the ceiling for tax-free income in fiscal 2018-19.

Not only that, from the incoming fiscal year the government will crackdown on employees evading income tax return submission.

His employer will have to submit statements on return submission by its employees.

If the firm fails to comply with the new measure, its entire tax returns will be audited by taxmen, a scenario that no firm would like to face as it invariably leads to higher taxes.

Apart from the changes in the law to tax the income of tech giants such as Facebook and Google, this is one of the major changes the tax authority is seeking to bring for next fiscal year with the viewing to widening the tax base.

Save for a 2.5 percentage reduction in the corporate tax rate for banks and financial institutions and withdrawal of a provision taxing dividend income multiple times, there is little to cheer for individual taxpayers and companies.

The National Board of Revenue is seeking to keep most of the tax measures unchanged in a bid to attain the 31 percent higher income tax collection target of Tk 102,201 crore for fiscal 2018-19.

Hasan feels hard done by the budgetary measures: not only was he dragged into the tax net for a Tk 4,000 month raise in salary, he also has to pay more for goods and services from the incoming fiscal year. “How will I make my ends meet?”

“The budget mainly focused on expanding the tax base and higher compliance,” said Sushmita Basu, a partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers Bangladesh.

The exemption of multi-tier dividend taxation would benefit many existing companies and encourage investment in the economy, said Basu, also the lead of Pricewaterhosue Coopers's Bangladesh Tax and Regulatory Services.

“Virtual businesses too would come under the tax net after ambiguities were cleared,” she added.

Taxmen said the NBR would collect withholding tax if anyone purchases any product such as apps and games or service while in Bangladesh. Some 3 percent withholding tax will be deducted during payment to virtual business platforms, officials said.

It has also brought in changes to the tax rules to ensure that car owners who are offering taxi service by way of Uber and Pathao will have to submit returns.

“We have tried to ensure increased compliance through the proposed measures,” said Md Shabbir Ahmed, NBR first secretary of income tax policy.

By ensuring compliance of withholding tax collection, which accounted for 62 percent of total income tax collection in fiscal 2016-17, the tax authority would be able to log in Tk 3,000-4000 crore more next fiscal year, especially from increased collection of payroll tax.

Officials said the tax rate cut for banks and financial institutions will cause a loss of about Tk 2,000 crore from the sector, which generate about Tk 10,000 crore in tax.

To offset the losses and increase tax collection, the NBR is also seeking to slap on wealth tax surcharge on those who own more than two cars or have property of 8,000 square feet in any city corporation.

It has also imposed Tk 3,000 as minimum surcharge if the net wealth of individuals is up to Tk 10 crore and Tk 5,000 for net wealth of above Tk 10 crore.

The tax authority also brought multi-purpose vessels under the tax net and proposed to increase the corporate tax for the garment sector, the main export earner, to 15 percent from 12 percent this fiscal year.

The tax collector also increased tax for garment firms establishing green building. Day care home and educational institutes for challenged persons have been offered exemption.

To curb tax evasion, the NBR also brought in changes in the rule under which other agencies can share financial information of taxpayers automatically with taxmen.

It also aims to use email as legal instrument to issue notice, according to tax measures.

However, less attention has been given to reforms, which analysts have seen suggesting for boosting revenue collection.

In his budget speech, Finance Minister AMA Muhith expected that the new income tax law would be placed in the parliament next fiscal year.

He also proposed to introduce electronic tax deduction system and establishment of a tax information unit.

The government has set the target to increase the number of registered taxpayers to 1 crore and the number of return filers to 80 lakh within the next 5 years to fiscal year 2022-23, Muhith said.

However, Sadiq Ahmed, vice chairman of Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, said the government believes that the drive to increase the number of income tax payers is working and continuing this drive is the primary focus of tax implementation for fiscal 2018-19.

“The target assumes that the government will adopt measures to improve tax administration, but these are not clearly identified in the budget,” he added.","Fri, 08 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/feature/images/overtime_income.jpg?itok=Y9HMNSOC,"['cheers', 'tk', 'tax', 'nbr', 'collection', 'measures', 'fiscal', 'income', 'increase', 'net', 'crore']", 
64,64,FL-2018-000070-BGD,Speak up Mumbai: Hell holes! Will BMC ever cover open manholes? - Daily News & Analysis,https://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-speak-up-mumbai-hell-holes-will-bmc-ever-cover-open-manholes-2624056,"The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) faces criticism every year for its negligence which puts citizen's lives at risk. However, the civic body is yet to learn its lesson. Open manholes around the city is one such legacy that reflects the failure of the civic body to fulfil its responsibilities. Open manholes not only pose threat to lives of the citizens, but could also lead to fatal accidents. During August 29 deluge last year, a prominent gastroenterologist from Bombay Hospital, Dr Deepak Amrapurkar died after falling into an open manhole. The BMC had been on the receiving end of consistent flax post the incident. However, investigation revealed that five local residents opened the manhole cover to help recede the rain water and left them unattended, giving a clean chit to BMC employees.

This year is no exception. On Friday two motorists tumbled into an open manhole in Matunga. It was the local people who covered the manhole after waiting for BMC to do its duty in vain. The BMC has now registered an FIR in Matunga police station against unknown citing sabotage.

Questions are being raised as to why BMC is not alert about a a manhole lying open and unattended in the middle of the road. Mumbaikars rant about how open manholes are death traps and how BMC is negligent about it, while DNA listens in.

VOICES

During monsoon when finding public transport is a big challenge, I dare to walk my way on the flooded roads. Knowing that there are open and unattended manholes. People are losing their lives, but BMC officials are yet to lear their lessons. Not attending open manholes and letting people die is a criminal offence.—Owais Mirza, resident of Mazgaon

There are so many open manholes. Most manholes are not covered properly after road repair work. Neither do they put up any barricade or caution sign. One has to watch one's steps, or you may just fall into one of the open manholes. Why don't the BMC workers cover the holes properly after completing their work?—Manda Shete, resident of Chembur

The civic body should learn lessons from the past. This year, small boy lost his life due to its sheer negligence of BMC. During heavy rains, BMC should take precautionary measures so that citizens don't have to suffer due to open manholes. It is definitely becoming a death trap during monsoon and the authority should be held responsible if manholes are kept open without caution signs.—Jayshree Nagvekar, Andheri

The BMC should ensure that no one can open the manholes, neither should they be left open and unattended. It is a death trap, for pedestrians as well as motorists. It is BMC's responsibility to ensure that the manholes are closed immediately after completion of any repair work that required them to open the manholes. Strict action should also be taken against the people who open the manholes during flooding and leave them unattended. At the same time, the BMC should take measures to prevent floodsin the city.—Nirali Koradia, Mulund east

Due to BMC's sheer negligence, the manholes have turned into death traps today. A variety of retention and high-security locking systems are available to clamp down on manhole cover theft. A student had come up with similar technique recently, the BMC should implement such techniques. Like every year nullahs were not cleaned, causing the areas to flood. The BMC is totally failing in its responsibility.— Vinod Roshan D'Souza, Bandra

If anyone feels that open manholes aren't dangerous, then there is some introspection warranted. BMC, need to take cognizance of the issue and resolve it soon. During maddening Mumbai monsoons, open manholes become a greater threat. Citizens also need to be vigilant and do their bit to report cases of stealth, damage or open manhole covers to help avert any untoward incident from occurring.—Hiren Metalia, Malad

An open manhole during monsoon and especially if it's flooded, is nothing less than a death trap. Last year we lost a bright soul near Deepak talkies, which is so close to my house. Imagining that someone drowned because they fell in a manhole sends a chill down my spine. Opening manholes for water to recede is an age old technique during flood like situation, but in a developing nation with the richest Municipal Corporation we need to come up with foolproof solutions.—Pradnya Khandori, Worli

Time and again manholes have proved dangerous to everyone from motorists to pedestrians. Some potholes had been serial killers! Every year there are news of deaths at the same location. That's beyond acceptable. If a society has to move ahead, it cannot make careless recurring mistakes like these. The authorities from elected representatives and officials should be made liable for such incidents.—Yashraj Akashi, resident of Dadar

EXPERT SPEAK

It's not just Matunga, manholes on the stormwater drain are lying open near Kalina Education Society. I complained to ward office and storm water drains officer, bur in vain. We activists keep complaining, fight for people's safety and follow up with ward office till an action is taken. It's only after a mishap the BMC wakes up. They try to take to take preventive measures, but most of them fail. BMC will be held responsible for any unfortunate incident since they did not take any action despite raising complaints.—Stany Dsouza, ALM of Kalina

I fail to understand that how a manhole in middle of a main road in Matunga is lying open for so long and neither the BMC nor traffic police is aware of it. The BMC has not learnt any lesson from last year's incident where a doctor lost his life. I have been raising so many civic issues with ward office, but they hardly pay heed. On Saturday a manhole was dislodged on BA Road. I called up disaster management control room, yet no danger sign was put near it. The area was flooded, anybody could have met with an accident.—Nikhil Desai, activist from Matunga","Mon, 11 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/11/691830-manholes-061118.jpg,"['holes', 'matunga', 'manholes', 'bmc', 'incident', 'cover', 'speak', 'civic', 'open', 'death', 'hell', 'mumbai', 'manhole', 'road', 'unattended']",

The two national highways and other state highways linking Aizawl and the second capital city of Lunglei have been blocked by landslides at multiple locations

While efforts are on to clear the landslides, but weather conditions are causing hindrances to the operations.

The older national highway is blocked by landslides at Hnahthial village in Lunglei district and the main World Bank road is being blocked at Ramlaitui village in Lunglei district.

The incessant downpour has also created panic at Sairang village, 30 kilometres from Aizawl.

The waters of Tlawng river are rising at a menacing rate even as the locals are apprehensive that the water level would soon cross the danger level.

“About 20 houses are vacated and more than ten houses have been already submerged by the flood. The local Young Mizo Association has been keeping vigil but nothing much can be done unless the rains stopped,” Lalhmangaiha, a local activist and villager from Sairang said.

“People here are already panic struck as they are haunted by last year’s devastating flood and are apprehensive of a repeat,” Lalhmangaiha added.

In the capital city of Aizawl, minor landslides can be seen in almost every locality.

However, fortunately no casualty has been reported so far. A house collapsed early Tuesday morning at Nursery locality with the residents suffering only minor injuries.

The major highway linking Aizawl and Lengpui Airport is also blocked by a huge landslide at Hunthar locality in southern Aizawl.

All traffic are diverted to an alternate Sakawrtuichhun road.

The southern Tuipui river also reached the danger level and has already submerged 10 houses at Tlabung village in Lunglei district.

Another 20 houses have to be evacuated fearing the rising waters would soon submerge these houses.

“The situation here is grim, the water level is rising like anything, with the continuous downpour. All we can do at the moment is evacuate,” Tlabung SDPO K Beihmotaosa said.

Elsewhere around Mizoram, several parts of Thenzawl town are submerged by the rising waters of Lau river and most parts of Borai village are also submerged in southern Mizoram.

The main water reservoir that feed Aizawl city is also submerged by the rising Tlawng river and the PHE department officials have stated that several pumping machines were being re-located and that water supply could be disrupted in the coming days.","Tue, 12 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://nenow.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mizo-landslide.jpg,"['blocked', 'havoc', 'submerged', 'aizawl', 'houses', 'water', 'lunglei', 'wreaks', 'downpour', 'mizoram', 'rising', 'landslides', 'unabated', 'village', 'river']",

67,67,FL-2018-000070-BGD,World's great cities hold key to fossil fuel cuts – Physics World - physicsworld.com,https://physicsworld.com/a/worlds-great-cities-hold-key-to-fossil-fuel-cuts/,"Governments anxious to reduce the national use of fossil fuels and limit climate change now know where to start: in the great cities. New research has confirmed what with benefit of hindsight should have been obvious – that the 54% of humanity that lives in the cities now accounts for more than 70% of global energy use.

And a new study of the so-called “carbon footprint” of 13,000 of the world’s urban areas has identified the most effective places to start. “The top 100 highest footprint cities worldwide drive roughly 20% of the global carbon footprint,” says Daniel Moran, of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

“This means concerted action by a small number of local mayors and governments can significantly reduce national carbon footprints.”

Matching information

Moran and colleagues from Japan, the US and Sweden report in the journal Environmental Research Letters that they defined cities as densely populated, contiguously built up urban areas, often straddling administrative boundaries. From space, Manchester and Salford in the UK would look like one city; Manhattan and Brooklyn, in the US, or Tokyo and Yokohama in Japan, would fade into each other.

The researchers then matched all the information they could find about existing carbon footprints – estimates of energy consumption – with national statistics on spending patterns, regional purchasing power data and a population map.

Cities – historic concentrations of people, business, industry, government, legislation, learning and inventiveness – are also concentrations of economic growth: 600 urban centres are thought to account for about 60% of global gross domestic product.

Cities may drive climate change, but they are also concentrations of people who will be most at risk, not just because cities are hotter than the surrounding countryside, but because, as the world warms, more people in more cities become increasingly vulnerable to extremes of heat and flood.

The message of the study is simple: when it comes to reducing fossil fuel use, carbon footprint and emissions of greenhouse gas, mayors, governors, councils and city bosses have as much opportunity as national governments – and more direct influence.

The scientists assembled their list of 13,000 cities from data from 187 of the world’s nations. Altogether 195 nations in 2015 in Paris agreed to work together to contain global warming, driven by fossil fuel use and consequential increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide, to, if possible, no more than 1.5 °C above historic levels by 2100.

In fact, the world has already warmed by around 1 °C on average in the last century: the challenge is to act in time to stop global warming rising to catastrophic levels.

Several surprises

And the new study delivers some useful places to begin. The top 100 cities are home to only 11% of the world’s population but drive 18% of the global carbon footprint.

The top three – Seoul in Korea, Guangzhou in China and New York in the US – are no surprise, but other metropolitan areas with unexpectedly large carbon footprints include Cologne in Germany, Manchester in the UK and Montreal in Canada.

Of the top 200, 41 cities – and these include Cairo in Egypt, Dhaka in Bangladesh and Lima in Peru – are in countries where both total emissions and emissions per head are low. But many of the world’s most carbon-intensive cities are in the world’s richest nations: that is, their civic authorities have the resources with which to act.

“The fact that carbon footprints are highly concentrated in affluent cities means that targeted measures in a few places and by selected coalitions can have a large effect covering important consumption hotspots,” says Moran.

PHOTO: MISHA FRIEDMAN

In 2015, Pavel Lobkov, a news anchor on TV Rain, an independent station in Moscow, confronted a predicament unlike any he had faced in more than 2 decades working as a journalist. It was World AIDS Day, and he was slated to host a show. His guest was the head of the Federal Center for the Prevention and Control of the Spread of AIDS, Vadim Pokrovsky. For 12 years, Lobkov had been Pokrovsky's patient.

Lobkov had never spoken publicly about his HIV status. No well-known person in Russia ever had—the country had no Magic Johnson. He asked a close friend for advice, who said to either call in sick or reveal his status. Lobkov switched off his cellphone. “Otherwise, I can call a second friend, a third friend, and somebody would distract me from doing this,” he says.

Lobkov opened the show, Hard Day's Night, by explaining that Pokrovsky was more than a guest. “You are the one I came to with my trouble in 2003,” he said, recounting the heartless way another doctor told him his diagnosis. His on-air revelation made headlines, even in the United States. And the fact that he was then nearly 50 and didn't have spots on his cheek, look exhausted, or show any signs that he was infected sent an important message to Russians, he says: You can live a normal life with HIV.

A priest who is known for speaking out against Vietnam's communist government has been banned from leaving the country

On June 11, Father Joseph Nguyen Duy Tan, pastor of Tho Hoa parish in Dong Nai province, was stopped at Tan Son Nhat International Airport by public security officers in Ho Chi Minh City.

Airport officers said in a document that Father Tan ""has not yet been allowed to travel abroad at the request of the Public Security Department of Dong Nai province."" They did not give more details.

They also asked the priest to contact the department to deal with the case.

Father Tan, 40, and 25 other priests from Xuan Loc Diocese were due to fly to Malaysia. The other priests were not banned.

In his complaint to the German embassy in Hanoi and the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Father Tan accused the government of arbitrarily violating his human rights.

""I doubted that the reason could result from my talk to European Union representatives at a meeting in a pagoda on May 16,"" Father Tan said.

Interfaith Council of Vietnam members including Father Tan presented examples of religious persecution by government authorities and police to diplomats from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the European Union at Giac Hoa Pagoda in Ho Chi Minh City.

Father Tan told diplomats that all religious organizations have to apply to government authorities for permits for their activities, even building a toilet or a fence.

""The asking-and-granting structure strengthens authorities' abuse of power to intervene in internal affairs of religions,"" he said.

Rumors swirled that one homeless person had torched another’s tent, but Los Angeles firefighters found no leads to investigate.

New tents quickly appeared along the fence at 38th and Hill streets, where Amy Willens’ Infiniti Q50 was destroyed that March day.

“I called LAPD,” said Willens, the controller of an apparel manufacturing firm. “They came out. I said, ‘Get them moved.’ They said they can’t.”

The homelessness crisis has affected virtually every neighborhood in Los Angeles. But the close interaction between encampment residents and businesses and homeowners is especially intimate and confrontational in the industrial zone east of USC, where the car fire occurred, and in a residential area along Grand Avenue not far away.

When it’s too hot to shut her bedroom window, Cindy Ramirez said, she will yell out to the people on the street to turn down the music booming on electricity pirated from disconnected street lights. But she said she can’t shut out the camp smells.

Over the last year, the business people and residents in these two sections of South L.A. have pursued an increasingly testy — but so far futile — campaign of emails, phone calls and meetings beseeching the city for relief.

Police, sanitation workers, council deputies, even a neighborhood prosecutor have attended meetings, listened, expressed sympathy and done whatever was in their power to help.

But, restrained by law, city policy and lack of resources, they have fallen short, unable to do the only thing that is asked of them — to get rid of the homeless camps.

On a Saturday morning in March, a convoy of trash trucks, California Highway Patrol escorts and a front-loading tractor arrived to clean up Grand Avenue near 55th Street, removing mounds of trash and sanitizing the sidewalk on the access road paralleling the 110 Freeway.

As they worked, residents of several streets that dead-end into Grand gathered at a nearby dance studio.

About 20 people listened as a young woman explained that their best hope of getting action from the city was to form a neighborhood association and flood the city with emails.

Many speakers bristled with anger and frustration.

“It’s something that’s tearing down our community, the drug dealers, the criminals, the ones beating up our females, our mothers,” said a young man who asked that his name not be used because he feared reprisals.

Others told of their cars being stoned, their yards defiled with feces and hypodermic needles, their children frightened.

“They are drug dealers,” an elderly man said. “We can’t walk over there because they intimidate us.”

When the meeting leader, who also asked to remain anonymous, walked back to her home on 53rd Street around noon, the homeless people who had carted away their possessions for the cleanup were bringing them back.

It all would be repeated in a week, the woman said. Warning signs would be posted. The shelters would disappear. The sidewalk would be sanitized. By the afternoon, the tents and tarps would all be back.

It happens every Saturday.

Los Angeles Police Officer John Boverie, assigned to the Newton Division homeless detail, keeps a handout summarizing Ordinance 56.11. The city law, adopted in 2016, seeks to “balance the needs of residents and the public at large” with the needs of “the city’s large and vulnerable homeless population.”

Among the rules: tents down from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.; space clear for wheelchair access at all times; personal property not to exceed what will fit in a 60-gallon bin; nothing tied or attached to private property.

The law is violated daily by tents and structures of cardboard, wood and plastic.

Given his limited resources, Boverie said, there is no practical way to enforce 56.11.

“It’s kind of hard to go around the whole division and say, ‘Put your tent down, put your tent down, put your tent down,’” Boverie said.

After three warnings, police can make a misdemeanor arrest for tent violations, he said, but it wouldn’t accomplish much: “If I take that person to jail, I have to go through the whole encampment and book whatever is salvageable and book it in a storage facility.”

Because of the hazards in camps, he can’t even do that without the assistance of sanitation crews.

And if he did book someone into jail, “by the time I get back to the station to write a police report and write a probable cause declaration for a judge to sign, they’re getting cited out at jail because there’s no room,” Boverie said.

In the enforcement vacuum, people devise their own strategies. Daniel Tenenblatt erected a fence in the middle of the sidewalk around his fabric factory, where 500 people work in shifts around the clock.

He said the camps were chasing away his customers.

“We sell fabrics,” he said. “We have people coming here and we want to tell them, ‘Buy it here and not in Bangladesh.’ They come in here and it looks like Bangladesh. People piled up. There’s filth. They have to hold their nose to walk in the building.”

Like the camps it is designed to repel, the fence is an illegal structure.

“Within a week the city came to cite us and tear [it] down,” Tenenblatt said.

But Councilman Curren Price’s district director, James Westbrooks, talked to the building department. The inspectors backed off. The fence still stands.

Another ordinance bans people from living in vehicles parked on residential streets. But recreational vehicles — including a cabin cruiser with no propeller — are permanently parked along Grand Avenue and the streets of the industrial zone.

At a meeting with city officials, Tenenblatt called attention to a map showing streets where he said RVs were parked illegally.

“These areas you can’t have an RV at night,” he told Gita O’Neill, assistant city attorney for homeless issues.

O’Neill politely corrected his interpretation of the law. The ordinance prohibits dwelling in those areas, not parking, O’Neill said.

“LAPD has to write a ticket to the person living in the vehicle,” she said. “They have to prove the person is living there day to day.”

In theory, residents in homes along Grand Avenue have more leverage. At Price’s request, all overnight parking is banned there. Nonetheless, people continue to park dilapidated RVs next to new signs prohibiting them between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m.

A resident who spoke at the community meeting said he set his alarm for 2 a.m. every night for weeks to complain to the Department of Transportation, which has round-the-clock enforcement.

At first officers ticketed the vehicles, he said. But when word got around that they wouldn’t ticket a vehicle without a license plate, plates disappeared and the vehicles remain.

Now, the man said, he started calling the police, again to no avail.

Boverie, of the Los Angeles Police Department’s Newton Division transient detail, said vehicles are seldom towed.

“When we impound the RVs, they have auctions at the impound yard,” Boverie said. “They get the RVs back at you wouldn’t believe what price.”

“Just to get them off the lot,” added his partner, Officer Ismael Tamayo. “The yards are losing money to store those RVs.”

“We have to call in advance,” Boverie said. “‘Do you have room?’ They say no. There’s nothing we can do about it. The RV stays.”

After a few weeks of complaints, the man said, the Department of Transportation started ticketing the vehicles again. They have since scattered to other streets in the neighborhood.

The proliferation of camps in the two areas goes back two to three years, when homeless people apparently began moving from elsewhere. It’s not clear why, but there are various theories.

Residents along Grand Avenue think a major cleanup of South Park, a few blocks to the east, and concerted pressure on camps west of the 110 Freeway on Flower Street caused a migration to Grand.

Some business owners attribute the camps between Broadway and Hill to a change in the hours of a nearby Volunteers of America shelter when it expanded from overnight-only to 24-hour operations. They think clients who previously bused back and forth to skid row every day began to hang out around the shelter.

Mitch Blumenfeld, who moved his business, Acme Display, into a building on Broadway in 2015, said several people living on adjacent sidewalks agreed to leave at his request. Others replaced them, however, and he has since been unable to dislodge them.

Now he struggles to keep tents away from his emergency exit. From time to time he steps outside to take photographs. His latest shows a man keeping two dogs in small cages stacked against his wall.

In December, Blumenfeld installed a surveillance camera in his parking lot.

The next Sunday, watching a live feed on his phone, he saw a man from the nearby tent camp hot-wire the gate open. Then a woman stood by waving a cardboard sign offering $20 parking to football fans headed to the nearby Coliseum.

Police couldn’t positively identify a suspect, said Newton Det. Michael Hernandez. No charges were filed.

Still, Blumenfeld finds the parking lot incident a minor nuisance next to his real concern: fires that break out regularly in the camps. One in March left a scorch mark on the side of his building. There was another fire outside his building in May.

“What very well could have been is those embers get on my roof and I have $5 million in inventory that could go up in smoke because our city is not enforcing the laws,” Blumenfeld told the city officials. “It’s not right.”

Maria Morales, whose shelter was attached to the fence where Willens’ car burned, said an eviction left her homeless. She said she’d like to work, but is caught in a dilemma.

“There’s times you can’t have a job because you’ve always got to be watching out for your tent because somebody could either come and steal things,” she said. “If they don’t steal your things, the city comes and takes it.”

Morales said outreach workers are trying to help her, but with no results so far.

“Right now, we’re just trying to work on getting identification, you know like an ID, you know what I mean, something to say, ‘This is me,’” Morales said.

That day she was gathering things to move before a cleanup scheduled the next day. At the last cleanup, she said, workers took her possessions.

Advertisement

“I said, ‘You guys are supposed to be here to clean, but you’re keeping our good stuff and just leaving the trash.’ Like, we’re not trash. We’re human beings like everybody else. We’re just trying to survive.”

She has since moved to a different sidewalk, but not because of the cleanup. In May, the landlord for the building erected a fence down the middle of the sidewalk like the one across the street.

Despite nightly sights that test his principles — people drinking in cars, “glass everywhere” — Elmer Roldan said he will not call police. “I am not of that mentality,” he said. “I am a believer in helping people.” (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times )

Elmer Roldan manages a Boyle Heights nonprofit that advocates for students. At night, he returns to the house he bought three years ago on 55th Street, three doors from Grand Avenue.

Roldan says the nightly scene is a test for him and his principles — “a condition where my values and my reality come in clash.”

“People hanging out every single night … cars pulling up and people drinking or smoking in the cars … people sleeping on the sidewalk, glass everywhere,” he said. “Then a lot of people hanging out, people that appeared annoyed that you were walking through their party.”

Roldan said he doesn’t view the camps as mostly made up of criminals. There are young couples, even families with children who show up and soon move on. But he reluctantly installed window bars after a homeless woman broke into his house.

And he rerouted his nightly walk with his dogs.

Unlike some neighbors, he doesn’t call the police.

“I am not of that mentality,” he said. “I am a believer in social services. I am a believer in helping people, especially when they are struggling.”

Roldan said he believes any solution has to be permanent. At the same time, he pines for a short-term fix.

“Is it possible to say, ’Hey look, if you’re camped out in front of a residence, or in front of a business, let’s move you to a more secluded space until we figure out a permanent solution’?”

A flurry of angry emails was touched off in April, when the city put a portable toilet on 38th Street, a block from where Willens’ car was burned. That precipitated a meeting with city officials at Acme Display, a reprise of a meeting almost a year earlier in which business owners pleaded for help.

Westbrooks, Price’s district director, asked them to be patient.

“It’s not going to be tomorrow,” he said. “It’s not going to be next week.”

Advertisement

But there will be results, he promised, because “the city is now all in.”

He said the business owners would begin to see results soon from an intensive outreach program by a local social services agency called HOPICS, which is sending teams to their neighborhood every day.

“It takes some time for folks to open up and let outreach workers know what their need is,” he said. “The hope is once they develop that relationship, either get them into a shelter or into some potential permanent supportive housing or get them into a hospital, so hopefully we can get them off the street.”

“I think that makes perfect sense,” said Tenenblatt, the fabric manufacturer.

But he remained skeptical. It would work, he said, only if coordinated with intensive daily cleanups.

“After the third time, I think you can convince a lot of people,” he said.

Eid shopping has gained momentum despite harsh weather in the provincial capital.All the markets and shopping malls have been decked out in colourful lights, while makeshift stalls selling glass bangles and henna dominates every corner.The harsh weather has only served to deter citizens from shopping during the daytime. After Iftar, people flood markets on shopping sprees that will last until chaand raat.“Eid is probably the biggest national and religious festival in Pakistan, where everybody buys new clothes and shoes for their families,” said shopper Faizan Qureshi.Countless stalls set up in Liberty Market, Anarkali Bazaar, Mall Road, Madina Market and other bazaars, remain open until Sehr due to the mass influx of customers. Some have even trekked all the way from rural areas to the provincial capital in order to partake in the Eid festivities.Muhammad Almas, a resident of Kasur, told The Express Tribune that he travelled all the way from his hometown in order to buy new clothes for his family. There are many shops on Ferozepur Road, but my wife prefers to buy her shoes from Liberty Market, he added.Another citizen, Bilal Khan from Khyber Pakhtunkhawa, revealed that he generally wears Peshawari chapals but for Eid he wanted to buy khussas from Taxila bazaar.“I prefer these shoes because they are well-made. Plus, the prices in the markets are very reasonable especially when you compare it with other markets in the city,” he maintained.However, despite the fact that many shops and brands are offering discounts and boasting of sales, some citizens are still complaining about inflated prices.During the last decade, hundreds of garment and shoe stores have opened up in Lahore, said Muhammad Hussain. This has prompted local product manufacturers to increase their prices, he claimed. “People from middle income groups, such as me, cannot afford branded garments. Instead, we buy locally made products that are not only good quality but also easy on the pocket.”Published in The Express Tribune, June 13, 2018.","Wed, 13 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://tribune-reloaded.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/1733784-image-1528823832/1733784-image-1528823832.jpg,"['despite', 'markets', 'shopping', 'shoes', 'weather', 'way', 'stalls', 'market', 'shops', 'tribune', 'buy', 'picks', 'eid', 'harsh']",

The London-based chef, who is associated with the Rang Mahal restaurant in Dubai as well as five others in the UK and Spain, had been reacting to an episode of the US TV programme Quantico.

A recent episode of the action series, which stars the Indian actor Priyanka Chopra, depicted a terrorist plot hatched by a group of Hindu nationalists. It provoked outrage among some Indians and Chopra apologised for the storyline at the weekend.

Kochhar tweeted on Sunday: “It’s sad to see that you [Chopra] have not respected the sentiments of Hindus who have been terrorized by Islam over 2000 years. Shame on You.”

He deleted the tweet the following day and apologised. “There is no justification for my tweet, a major error made in the heat of the moment on Sunday,” he wrote.

“I fully recognise my inaccuracies that Islam was founded around 1,400 years ago and I sincerely apologise. I am not Islamophobic, I deeply regret my comments that have offended many.”

Kochhar was the second Indian chef to receive a Michelin star, awarded to his Benares restaurant in London in 2007.

He apologised again on Wednesday after a flood of outraged on social media including threats to boycott his Dubai restaurant and the JW Marriott Marquis hotel that houses it.

But the hotel announced on Wednesday afternoon it was terminating its relationship with the Indian-born chef, who has appeared in MasterChef in the UK and India.

“Following the recent comments made by chef Atul Kochhar, we have taken the decision to end our agreement with him for Rang Mahal,” said a spokeswoman. “At the JW Marriott Marquis hotel Dubai we pride ourselves on creating a culture of diversity and inclusion for our guests and associates across the hotel and our restaurants.”

Kochhar said in a statement: “The decision by JW Marriott Marquis Dubai is deeply upsetting, however I fully accept the great pain I have caused and the difficult position the hotel has been put in.

“I have great respect for JW Marriott and in particular their staff in Dubai and wish the hotel well for the future. I hope my friends and well-wishers in Dubai will forgive me and continue to support me in the future.”

Islamic empires have claimed parts of the Indian subcontinent for more than 1,000 years and much of what is modern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh was ruled by the Muslim Mughals from the 16th century until they were displaced by the British.



The Mughals integrated and became an Indian dynasty; about 172 million Muslims live in India today, one of the largest Islamic populations in the world.

Hindu nationalists view the Mughal and earlier eras as a period of foreign rule when their traditions and culture were diluted. This nationalist or Hindutva vision was once fringe but has increasingly become mainstream in the past three decades.

Soon after he was elected prime minister in 2014, Narendra Modi, a staunch Hindu nationalist, told parliament the country needed to throw off its “slave mentality of 1,200 years” – seen as a reference to the period of Islamic and British rule.

ABC studios, which produces Quantico, apologised for the storyline on Sunday and defended Chopra, who they said “didn’t create the show, nor ... write or direct it”.

It added: “The show has featured antagonists of many different ethnicities and backgrounds, but in this case we inadvertently and regrettably stepped into a complex political issue. It was certainly not our intention to offend anyone.”","Wed, 13 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ef9758ef384034daf6b6dfbdf6c0a298e35ed97/0_1022_3682_2208/master/3682.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6ee3076e51d3d68015e0a7d8cf5e227e,"['atul', 'dubai', 'michelinstarred', 'jw', 'chef', 'marquis', 'sacked', 'restaurant', 'kochhar', 'antiislam', 'chopra', 'apologised', 'marriott', 'hotel', 'indian']",

77,77,FL-2018-000070-BGD,Cyber Business Interruption Remains Area of Uncertainty for Insurance - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2018/06/12/491842.htm,"Although the insurance industry may have had plenty of time to wrap its mind around managing physical property threats, what about the newly growing area of non-physical threats?

Panelists at the 2018 PLUS Cyber Symposium, held in May in Chicago, Ill., discussed how the cyber-related business interruption space differs from traditional, property-related business interruption.

“We’ve got a lot of weather experience from hundreds of years of tracking that. The insurance industry knows where the wind is going to blow, so from an individual risk standpoint and from a risk aggregation standpoint, insurance companies can manage that,” said panelist Jason Glasgow, vice president in the E&O division at Allied World. “Nobody knows where the cyber winds are going to blow.”

Indeed, cyber attacks were cited as the top threat to businesses worldwide in the Business Continuity Institute’s 2018 Horizon Scan Report, with data breaches and unplanned telecom outages ranking second and third in the report.

Since 2011, the study has tracked challenges to business continuity globally by asking survey respondents about perceived threats, which have migrated over the years from adverse weather and political unrest to cyber attacks and data breaches.

However, as non-physical threats become more of a concern for business continuity, the insurance industry will need to address certain gray areas in its coverage of cyber-related business interruption, panelists discussed.

“In business interruption, we do see some gray areas on policies,” said panelist Catherine Rudow, senior vice president of North America Property and Casualty and senior underwriter of Casualty at PartnerRe. “I wonder if as claims start coming in, we’ll start to see the insurance industry figure out where in fact these losses do belong.”

Business interruption coverage began in property policies as an add-on with a built-in waiting period of as little as 48 hours to as long as two weeks in some cases to cover the revenue a company would have earned while being down due to physical perils such as fire, flood or power outages, Glasgow explained.

In the cyber world, business interruption coverage functions similarly, although the triggers involve events such as computer system shutdowns due to hacking or a data breach, and the waiting periods can be much shorter – typically a matter of hours, he said.

Recently, cyber-related business interruption has broadened beyond technology simply malfunctioning to include voluntary system shut-downs as preventative measures or anything cyber-related that interrupts a company’s ability to function, added Bob Parisi, managing director and cyber product leader at Marsh. As the market has expanded, coverage has begun to separate itself from traditional property policies.

“If companies think they are insuring business interruption by buying an additional property policy, they have to realize that they’re not because traditional property policies are retracting and pulling back to accommodate expanding cyber coverage,” Parisi said.

As cyber-related business interruption coverage continues to evolve, however, the insurance industry has struggled to understand the exposures, panelists said.

“I think we’re seeing a lot of confusion out there amongst not only organizations trying to quantify their exposure and get their arms around questions of ‘How much are we exposed? What would a potential BI loss look like due to a cyber peril?’ but also, on the insurance market side of things, it sounds like there’s the need for greater clarity as to where these exposures are,” said panelist Chris Mortifoglio, senior vice president of Procor Solutions & Consulting.

This is because although the property market has had plenty of time to build deep history and expertise, the cyber market is a relatively new area for insurers.

“Property has a lot more ability to support big losses than our cyber product does,” Rudow said.

She added that an hour-long loss in property looks different than an hour-long cyber loss because the property market has enough experience to know what questions to ask and more substance regarding how to measure the risk it is taking on involving business interruption.

“Whereas [with cyber], we’re sort of guessing,” Rudow said. “Where do we manage it and underwrite it? How do we eliminate or change how we trigger our deductible?…It’s still an area of uncertainty.”

Parisi believes that, except when it comes to privacy risk, one of the biggest struggles in terms of cyber is the lack of statistically significant actuarial data to model risk.

“It’s not necessarily the risk, it’s the lack of knowledge about the risk,” he said. “I think a truly effective business interruption modeling tool continues to be somewhat elusive.”

However, he stated this is something that he believes will simply take time.

“We won’t have a large body of claim data for a while – that’s just a function of you get 10 years of data for being around 10 years,” he said.

Defining Policy Terms

That said, one concern from the start has been a lack of clarity in the way terms are defined in cyber policies, panelists said.

“If you look at five cyber polices from five different markets, you’ll see six different wordings,” Parisi said. “There’s no consistency.”

As a result of the long history in the property underwriting market, there is more specificity when it comes to policies, particularly regarding standard terms such as ‘occurrence’ or ‘event,’ Mortifoglio said. In cyber, it’s less clear, panelists agreed.

Glasgow pointed to an example of a company experiencing two back-to-back outages to demonstrate the challenges around carving out language in cyber policies.

“Is [the second outage] another event? Or is it related to the first event?” he said. “It’s much more difficult than if you had a fire in a building that burns down, and that’s it – that’s the event.”

Aggregation Concerns

Beyond policy definitions, adding to the confusion about cyber-related business interruption is the fact that cyber differs from the traditional property market in terms of the potential for aggregation events, panelists explained.

“If you have 10 manufacturing facilities, you know very well what those vulnerabilities are. If you operate in the Gulf Coast region, you’re concerned about hurricanes. If you’re in California, you’re concerned about fires. The likelihood of all of your facilities being impacted by one single peril is minimal,” Mortifoglio said. “With a cyber peril, you now no longer have those physical constraints, and you could be impacted on a global basis across your entire organization.”

Indeed, a company could experience a total loss or a 10 percent loss, leading to uncertainty in terms of where the risk could be concentrated, Glasgow said.

The prevalence of organizations utilizing the same major technology companies also adds to the aggregation concern, Parisi said.

“There are four or five technology companies that are in every single company out there, but the market seems to kind of turn a blind eye and says, ‘We’re going to pretend we don’t know that’s the aggregation function,'” he explained. “The market says, ‘We want our insureds to be with best-in-breed technology companies.’ Well, if you encourage everyone to be with the best-in-breed technology companies, you’re funneling everyone into an aggregation position.”

Glasgow pointed to an example of the recent Amazon web service outage at the end of February.

“I can guarantee myself and every other insurance carrier held their breath when they saw that on the internet and said, ‘This is it. This is the one that’s going to be the aggregation event,'” he said. “Well, it turns out they were down for four hours. No one really had any loss.”

Although the impact was minimal, Glasgow said it did teach the industry about resiliency.

“It taught us that not only do our insureds all have resiliency, but the companies in question have resiliency in place, and they want to get up and running as quickly as possible,” he said. “So I think events like that which haven’t led to losses have informed us as well.”

In fact, Parisi said he believes the idea of a total aggregation event is a little far-reaching. This is because technology is used differently within each company, so the risk is always going to be different, he explained.

“The concept that you can just kind of ‘tip over’ is theoretically possible, but I think that’s a caution that’s a step too far,” he said.

He pointed to the Petya and NotPetya attacks of 2016 and 2017 as an example.

“That was a huge loss in the billions of dollars going through the cyber and property markets, but it was fairly constrained. The internet didn’t tip over,” he said.

Data Breach Lessons

With this in mind, there are still valuable lessons in some of the big data breaches of the past couple of years, even for those that weren’t impacted, panelists agreed.

“Petya and NotPetya was a very expensive proof of concept for a variety of industries that had for longest time said they would never have a problem because this wasn’t their issue; they didn’t take credit cards,” Parisi said. “But that ability for that piece of ransomware that had malware behind it to shut down multiple industries across the globe and basically break a substantial portion of their hardware is something that we need to question what we learned. It’s just as important to figure out what companies did that were in the neighborhood at the time, but didn’t get hit.”

Rudow said she believes change is already occurring as a result of claims from past breaches, and Mortifoglio agreed.

“Some of those events like WannaCry had a fairly significant impact on a relatively small number of U.S. companies,”Mortifoglio said. “As a result, we have a combination of companies and carriers becoming more aware of these exposures and more aware of the benefits of coverage related to cyber, as well as a lot more requests to buy business interruption coverage.”

Rudow added that although the industry doesn’t quite have all of the answers yet, it is working through them and will need to continue to adapt in order to find its footing in the future.

“By my calculations, we come to market between $3.5-4 billion, so we’re still very small,” Rudow said. “Even the NotPetya attacks would have destroyed the market had they been fully insured, and it was a small number of companies that were hit. I think we need to start promoting ourselves, making ourselves attractive and having some scale, so we can handle a large loss when it comes through.”

Wayback set to work on expansion right in the thick of the Great Recession, more than doubling its unit count in a two-year span when many brands were constricting. There are a bevy of reasons why, naturally, but Chemero, Wayback’s executive vice president, points to one foresight he believes ignited the brand’s growth.

He noticed, as many operators did, the cost of rent rising at an alarming pace across the country. “And sooner or later the price points weren’t going to be … well, you couldn’t sell enough burgers to pay the bills and make profit. It was that simple,” he says.

Wayback’s answer: the brand went small. It started looking at 1,600-square-foot boxes as its vehicle for growth. “It was funny,” Chemero says. “A lot of our competitors said you guys are crazy. You can’t do enough volume in a small box like that to pay the bills. We’re like no, you’re wrong because technology has finally caught up with the restaurant industry.”

Wayback was a technology pioneer in the burger space. Want proof? Olo, a digital juggernaut that currently powers digital ordering and delivery for more than 200 restaurant brands across 45,000 locations, and is used by 100 million-plus customers, linked with Wayback some eight years ago. “They still thank us to this day because we were one of their first customers,” Chemero says.

When the app craze hit in 2011–2012, Wayback was an early adopter with delivery and mobile pay platforms. The chain had digital capabilities for guests to curbside pick up, order-ahead, and accept delivery in some markets well before off-premises was the headline grabber it is today. Some franchisees and operators were even jumping in their cars and bringing food to guests.

Chemero adds that Wayback is currently working on a “game-changer” in the delivery space that will erase the burden of the delivery dilemma. He couldn't share exact details just yet. “The individual restaurant owner, how do they pay for that? How do they absorb 35 percent off the top on each order? Thirty percent on each order. Something’s got to give,” he says of third-party vendors.

Another perk of being a small-footprint operation was the low initial investment, which attracted a wide pool of franchisees. Wayback averages about $350,000 to open a restaurant and charges a 5 percent royalty fee. The desirable entry point is one reason it keeps landing on best franchise lists, including No. 8 on the latest FranchiseRankings.com collection for fast casual options. Perspective operators need to have liquid capital of $125,000 and a net worth of $350,000 to qualify.

Chemero says the financial allure doesn’t sum up the story, however. Wayback looks at the service equation from two sides of the same spectrum: Its operators must put hospitality on a pedestal, and the company’s 30 or so corporate employees must do the same for franchisees.","Thu, 14 Jun 2018 20:42:23 GMT",https://www.qsrmagazine.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/news-image/wayback-burgers-recognized-franchising-gives-back-awards.jpg?itok=hTZXqgRC,"['delivery', 'franchisees', 'digital', 'worth', 'chemero', 'operators', 'growth', 'inside', 'wayback', 'burgers', 'pay', 'blazing', 'brands', 'restaurant']",

By measuring the levels of certain placental RNA transcripts in maternal blood, Ngo et al. developed two noninvasive blood tests that provide a window into the progression of individual pregnancies. In a small proof-of-concept study, the first blood test predicted fetal age and delivery date with an accuracy comparable to that of ultrasound. The second blood test, also examined in a small pilot study, discriminated women at risk of preterm delivery from those who delivered at full term. The next step will be to assess the reliability of the tests in large, blinded clinical trials. Science, this issue p. 1133

Abstract Noninvasive blood tests that provide information about fetal development and gestational age could potentially improve prenatal care. Ultrasound, the current gold standard, is not always affordable in low-resource settings and does not predict spontaneous preterm birth, a leading cause of infant death. In a pilot study of 31 healthy pregnant women, we found that measurement of nine cell-free RNA (cfRNA) transcripts in maternal blood predicted gestational age with comparable accuracy to ultrasound but at substantially lower cost. In a related study of 38 women (25 full-term and 13 preterm deliveries), all at elevated risk of delivering preterm, we identified seven cfRNA transcripts that accurately classified women who delivered preterm up to 2 months in advance of labor. These tests hold promise for prenatal care in both the developed and developing worlds, although they require validation in larger, blinded clinical trials.

Understanding the timing and programming of pregnancy has been a topic of interest for thousands of years. The ancient Greeks had surprisingly detailed knowledge of the different stages of fetal development; they proposed mathematical theories to account for the timing of important landmarks of pregnancy, including delivery of the baby (1–3). Although biologists now have detailed cellular and molecular portraits of both fetal and placental development, this knowledge has not yet translated into molecular tests that reliably predict gestational age for individual pregnancies. Blood levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and α-fetoprotein are used to detect conception and fetal complications, respectively; however, neither molecule (either individually or in conjunction) establishes gestational age (4, 5).

Ultrasound imaging and/or the patient’s estimate of her last menstrual period are typically used to estimate gestational age, but the former can be expensive and the latter can be imprecise. Inaccurate dating sometimes leads to unnecessary induction of labor and Cesarean sections, extended postnatal care, and/or increased medical expenses (6–9). Current methods to estimate delivery date generally assume normal development and do not account for premature birth, which affects approximately 15 million neonates every year worldwide (10). In the United States (11), premature birth is the leading cause of neonatal death and complications later in life. Two-thirds of these occur spontaneously, and it would be beneficial to be able to identify which pregnancies are at risk (12, 13). Efforts to identify genetic causes and risk factors have had limited success (11, 14–17), and clinically, transvaginal sonographic cervical length (CL) and cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin (fFN) measurements have low positive predictive value (21% for CL and 17% for fFN) and specificity (52% for CL) (18).

In previous work, we showed that longitudinal phenotypic changes in both the mother and the fetus could be monitored by noninvasively measuring cell-free RNA (cfRNA) transcripts from fetal tissues in maternal blood (19). Here, we investigated whether this methodology can be developed into blood tests that establish gestational age and estimate the risk of preterm birth. In our initial study, we recruited 31 pregnant women from Denmark who agreed to donate a blood sample during each week of their pregnancy, resulting in a total of 521 samples (Fig. 1). All women delivered at full term, defined as gestational age at delivery of ≥37 weeks, and their medical records showed no unusual health changes during pregnancy (table S1). Each sample was analyzed by highly multiplexed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a panel of genes with expression specific to the placenta or to the immune system, or highly enriched in the fetal liver (table S2).

Fig. 1 Sample collection timelines from the Denmark, University of Pennsylvania, and University of Alabama cohorts. Squares, inverted triangles, and lines indicate sample collection times, delivery dates, and individual women, respectively.

We observed that cfRNA measurements over the course of pregnancy demonstrated differing time courses according to tissue of origin (Fig. 2A and fig. S1). As expected, the levels of cfRNA corresponding to genes specific to the placenta and enriched in the fetal liver increased throughout the course of pregnancy, with the exception of cfRNA corresponding to chorionic gonadotropin β subunit (CGB), which decreased from a peak found in the first trimester. Placental cfRNAs and several fetal liver cfRNAs were not detected above the noise floor after delivery, which supports their pregnancy-derived origin; some fetal liver transcripts were also expressed in the adult liver, and we observed a small maternal baseline for this subset. cfRNA measurements corresponding to immune system–related genes increased during gestation and showed a return to measurable baselines after delivery, which supports their predominantly maternal origin. The body mass index of the mother did not significantly affect cfRNA levels (see supplementary text). Using estimates of cfRNA concentrations in blood across all genes and all pregnancies (Fig. 2B and fig. S2), we discovered that genes within each set (i.e., placental, immune, and fetal) were highly correlated with each other [Median Pearson correlation r = 0.79 (placental), 0.79 (immune), 0.74 (fetal), P < 10−14] and that placental and fetal cfRNA were weakly cross-correlated (r = 0.47, P < 10−15). These findings suggested that cfRNA corresponding to placental genes might provide an accurate estimate of fetal development and gestational age throughout pregnancy.

Each point represents the mean cfRNA value ± SEM for either 31 women or 21 women (the latter denoted by †). The antepartum period is highlighted in gray. Placental, immune, and fetal liver–specific genes are highlighted in blue, green, and orange, respectively. (B) Heat map of the Pearson correlation coefficient for each gene pair shows that placental, immune, and fetal liver–specific cfRNA [same group colors as (A)] measurements are highly correlated with each other [median Pearson correlation r = 0.79 (placenta), 0.79 (immune), 0.74 (fetal liver); P < 10−14]. Placental and fetal liver–specific genes also show a weak degree of cross-correlation (r = 0.47, P < 10−15). Gene order matches order shown in (A), omitting genes denoted by † in (A). (C) Cross-validated random forest (RF) model predicts time to delivery from sampling time point (R = 0.91, P < 10−15, n = 21) for training cohort. (D) Cross-validated random forest model predicts time to delivery from sampling time point (R = 0.89, P < 10−15, n = 10) for validation cohort.

AU, arbitrary units.

We then built a random forest model to predict time from sample collection until delivery, using cfRNA measurements as the primary features. We trained and validated this model using data from the Danish cohort from 21 women (n = 306 blood samples) for training, and from 10 women (n = 215 blood samples) for validation. During training, we applied best-subset selection with 10-fold cross-validation repeated 10 times (see supplementary materials) to identify nine cfRNAs that are specific to the placenta (CGA, CAPN6, CGB, ALPP, CSHL1, PLAC4, PSG7, PAPPA, and LGALS14) and together provided equivalent predictive power to the full panel of 51 measured cfRNAs (fig. S3). Our model’s predictions agreed with observed values for both training (Pearson correlation r = 0.91, P < 10−15) (Fig. 2C) and validation sets (r = 0.89, P < 10−15) (Fig. 2D). We also found that model performance improved significantly over the course of pregnancy, as measured by root mean squared error (RMSE) for both training [RMSE = 6.0 (first trimester, T1), 3.9 (second trimester, T2), 3.3 (third trimester, T3), 3.7 (postpartum, PP) weeks] (Fig. 2C) and validation sets [RMSE = 5.4 (T1), 4.2 (T2), 3.8 (T3), 2.6 (PP) weeks] (Fig. 2D). Although distinct subsets of the nine cfRNAs listed above were sufficient to predict time until delivery for subpopulations of women (i.e., nulliparous or multiparous women), we found that all nine genes identified were necessary for accurate prediction across subgroups (see supplementary text).

The model’s two most important features, CGA and CGB, encoding chorionic gonadotropin α and β3 subunits of HCG, are known contributors to pregnancy initiation (20) and behaved consistently with what is known from HCG levels during pregnancy (21). Other genes included in the model, such as PAPPA (pregnancy-associated plasma protein A), are associated with pregnancy risks such as preterm birth (22).

We next compared our model to other established tools used to predict gestational age (Fig. 2E). In previous studies, ultrasound and last menstrual period estimates of gestational age, which assume delivery at 40 weeks gestation, fell within 14 days of the observed gestational age at delivery with 57.8% and 48.1% accuracy, respectively (7). In this study, for all 31 Danish women, cfRNA estimates of gestational age averaged over a given trimester fell within 14 days of the observed gestational age at delivery with 32% (T2), 23% (T3), and 45% (T2 and T3) accuracy, as compared to 48% (T1) for ultrasound (Table 1). Our results are thus generally comparable to ultrasound measurements, can be performed throughout pregnancy, and do not require a priori physiological knowledge such as the woman’s last menstrual period.

Table 1 Comparison of gestational age estimates using cfRNA and ultrasound. Distribution of difference between estimates of gestational age, which assume delivery at 40 weeks gestation, and observed gestational age at delivery listed for four distinct methods, where n indicates the number of women included. Gestational age was estimated using cfRNA measurements from the second (T2), third (T3), or both (T2 and T3) trimesters and ultrasound measurements from the first trimester (T1). View this table:

Although the first-generation random forest model predicted time until delivery for full-term pregnancies, we were also interested in testing its performance to predict spontaneous preterm delivery (defined as spontaneous delivery earlier than 37 weeks; see supplementary materials). To explore this question, we studied two separate cohorts, one recruited by the University of Pennsylvania (n = 15) and the other by the University of Alabama at Birmingham (n = 23). All of the women in both of these cohorts were already known to be at elevated risk of preterm delivery because they had premature contractions (Pennsylvania) or had a prior spontaneous preterm delivery (Alabama) (Fig. 1, table S1, and supplementary materials). All women in the Alabama cohort and three women in the Pennsylvania cohort received progesterone injections because of a prior spontaneous preterm delivery. All women went into labor spontaneously.

We discovered that although the model validated performance for full-term pregnancies (n = 23, RMSE = 4.3 weeks) in these cohorts, it generally failed to predict time until delivery for preterm deliveries (n = 13, RMSE = 11.4 weeks) (fig. S4). This suggests that the model’s content may not account for the various outlier physiological events that may lead to preterm birth. This conclusion is supported by the observation that pharmacological agents designed to stop or slow uterine contractions prevent only a small number of preterm deliveries (23, 24).

To identify cfRNA transcripts that might be able to discriminate a spontaneous preterm delivery from a full-term delivery, we performed unblinded RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on plasma-derived cfRNA collected from women who delivered at full term (n = 7) and preterm (n = 8) in a preterm-enriched cohort (Pennsylvania) (Fig. 1 and table S1). Analysis of RNA-seq data indicated that 38 genes could separate full-term from preterm births with statistical significance (P < 0.001; see supplementary materials) (Fig. 3A). We then created a PCR panel to measure the 38 cfRNAs identified by RNA-seq and other immune and placental genes (table S2). We confirmed that the differential expression observed using RNA-seq was also observed with quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) (r = 0.72, P < 10−15) (fig. S5).

Fig. 3 Application of cfRNA measurements to predict risk of spontaneous preterm delivery. (A) Heat map of the z-scores for 38 differentially expressed genes identified using cfRNA-seq (P < 0.001, exact test, likelihood ratio test, and quasi-likelihood F test) shows that genes distinguish women who delivered spontaneously preterm from women who delivered at full term. The two groups of women were separated using hierarchical clustering. (B) Means ± SD for differentially expressed genes validated using qRT-PCR in the discovery [University of Pennsylvania (I) and Denmark (II)] and validation [University of Alabama (III)] cohorts. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.0005 (Fisher exact test). (C) Receiver operating characteristic curves for classifier designed to separate women who deliver spontaneously preterm from women who deliver at full term for both the discovery cohort (University of Pennsylvania and Denmark, AUC = 0.86) and the validation cohort (University of Alabama, AUC = 0.81).

We then developed a classifier to identify women who are at risk of preterm delivery and found that using the top seven cfRNAs from the panel (CLCN3, DAPP1, PPBP, MAP3K7CL, MOB1B, RAB27B, and RGS18) [false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 5%, Hedges’ g ≥ 0.8] (Fig. 3B) in unique combinations of three (table S3 and supplementary materials) accurately classified 6 of 8 preterm samples (75%) and misclassified only 1 of 26 full-term samples (4%) from the Pennsylvania and Denmark cohorts, with a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 (Fig. 3C). In validation using a preterm-enriched independent cohort (the Alabama cohort), the test accurately classified 4 of 5 preterm samples (80%) and misclassified 3 of 18 full-term samples (17%) (Fig. 1), with a mean AUC of 0.81 (Fig. 3C), using samples collected up to 2 months in advance of labor. Several of the cfRNAs used to predict spontaneous preterm delivery were also individually elevated in women who delivered preterm (FDR ≤ 5%, Hedges’ g ≥ 0.8), demonstrating the robustness of their effect (Fig. 3B). Note that the differences in cfRNA levels cannot be accounted for entirely by progesterone injections, because every woman in the Alabama cohort received injections and the same differences between groups were observed.

Further investigation of the seven genes corresponding to the transcripts identified above revealed that most are ubiquitously expressed, with the exception of a member of the RAS oncogene family (RAB27B), which encodes a protein that regulates placental development (25) and the gene encoding pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP). Other protein products encoded by DAPP1 (dual adaptor of phosphotyrosine 3-phosphoinositides 1) (26), RGS18 (regulator of G protein signaling 18) (27), CLCN3 (chloride voltage-gated channel 3) (28, 29), and MOB1B (MOB kinase activator 1B) (30) are indirectly implicated in pregnancy through inflammation (DAPP1, RGS18), labor (CLCN3), and development (MOB1B).

The cfRNA results can be compared to efforts to estimate preterm risk using mass spectroscopic measurements of the ratio of two proteins in blood [SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin) and IBP4 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4)] (31) or CL and fFN measurements (18). In this pilot study, our blood test yielded higher mean accuracy than the mass spectroscopic approach for comparable sample sizes in the validation cohorts [AUC = 0.81 (cfRNA), AUC = 0.67 (IBP4/SHBG)]. When compared to CL and fFN measurements for symptomatic high-risk women experiencing preterm labor, the PCR-based test had a higher positive predictive value [17% (CL), 21% (fFN), 75% (cfRNA, discovery), 80% (cfRNA, validation)] (18).

Our study has important limitations. Before a diagnostic or screening test based on this work can be used in the clinic, a blinded clinical trial with a larger sample size and diverse ethnicities is essential. Our pilot studies included one Caucasian cohort and two African-American cohorts; data from other ethnic groups would be valuable. Another limitation is that the preterm risk cohorts were all recruited on the basis of elevated risk for preterm birth; it will be important to investigate the performance of the blood test in a broader, unselected population.

Our pilot studies have shown that noninvasive blood tests were able to predict gestational age and identify women at risk of preterm delivery from the same blood sample. These cfRNA PCR-based tests have two advantages over alternatives: broader applicability and lower cost. They can be applied across the globe as a complement to or substitute for ultrasound, which can be expensive and inaccurate during the second and third trimesters (32). Conceivably, similar approaches will prove to be useful for identifying and monitoring fetuses with congenital defects that can be treated in utero—a rapidly growing area of fetal medicine.

In her thesis, ‘Agrarian economy of the Carnatic in the 17th and 18th centuries,’ Parvathi Menon, whose research supervisor was Dr. Irfan Habib, writes that Vijayanagar inscriptions put villages under three categories, one of which was “bandaravada or crown villages, the revenues of which often went to the upkeep of the nearest fort.” We find this categorisation in Srirangapatnam, Udayagiri and Penukonda. Parvathi Menon writes that bandaravada became pandaravadai in Tamil. Interestingly, there is a village by the name of Pandaravadai in Papanasam taluk, Thanjavur district.

There are Maratha period references to the village. A Modi document talks of a flood in Pandaravadai in 1,748 C.E. In 1,756 C.E., King Pratap Singh gifted 1,340 kuzhi (close to two lakh square feet) of land to Mohammad Khan, a revenue officer of Pandaravadai. A 1,785 C.E. document talks of Lanchana Mahal in Pandaravadai taluk. K.M. Venkatramaiah, in his book on the Marathas, writes that since lanchana means seal, Lanchana Mahal must have been a place where the royal seal was affixed on documents. This points to the historical importance of Pandaravadai. The Madras District Gazetteers of Tanjore, 1906, by F.R. Hemingway, records that most of the inhabitants of Pandaravadai were Muslims (mostly Ravuttars) engaged in betel cultivation.

Sometime in 1,389 C.E., a small mosque was built in Pandaravadai, by the Muslim community of the area.

In 1,519 C.E., Shahul Hamid Badusha of Nagore visited Pandaravadai, and suggested that a bigger mosque be built near the small one. The villagers, who even at that time were betel cultivators, said that they did not have the wherewithal for such a huge expense. Shahul Hamid Badusha found a copper pillar in a pond nearby and told them to sell it and use the funds. Every family chipped in according to its capacity. The new mosque came to be called Periya Pallivasal — Big Mosque — to distinguish it from the already existing smaller one. The plastering, however, was done 300 years later. In course of time, cracks developed in the dome and walls.

E.K.P. Jawahar Ali, an army man from the village, felt something had to be done to preserve the historically important structure. So, in 2004, along with three elders of the village — Abdul Hamid, a retired official of the United Nations, S.O.K. Haja Mohideen and Y.H. Mohammed Zakaria, he approached Rajendran, a conservation engineer of Thanjavur.

Conservation efforts

Rajendran discovered the reason for the cracks. When it rained, water from a canal near the mosque overflowed and seeped into the basement. This had affected the walls and the floor. To tackle this problem, Rajendran used a technique called lime injection. The principle is very similar to using a piece of chalk to blot spilt ink. One and a half feet away from the foundation, a pit was dug, nine-ft deep, one-foot in diameter. A mixture of lime and sand in equal proportion was put into the pit. This mix filled up cracks in the clay and absorbed moisture, thereby protecting the basement of the mosque. Pointing to the excellent acoustics of the mosque, Rajendran says, “The mosque has five vaults, which deflect the prayer of the maulvi and carry it to the end, without any distortion.”

Since the original plastering had been done using egg white, Rajendran wanted the re-plastering to be done the same way. After some diligent searching, they found someone in Karaikudi, who had done such plastering. Since he had lost his sight, he could not undertake the work, but gave instructions on how to go about it. However, they encountered another problem — cracks appeared because they were using Broiler eggs, whereas the earlier plastering had been done using country eggs! They tweaked the proportion and finally the re-plastering was done.

Rajendran suggested that the open courtyard should not be enclosed, because it provided lung space. He said that during Ramzan, a temporary shelter like a shamiana, could be provided to accommodate more worshippers. Mohammed Harris, from the School of Architecture, Anna University, who visited the mosque, commended Rajendran’s technical perfection and concurred with him on leaving the courtyard open. “Rajendran did not take even a rupee as consultation fee,” says Jawahar.

While there are seven mosques in Pandaravadai, Periya Pallivasal is the biggest, and administers three other mosques in the village. Former Presidents Zakir Hussain and Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed have visited the mosque. The latter has recorded in the visitors’ book that Periya Pallivasal is a diamond hidden away in a village.

“The mosque can easily accommodate 500 people. It has a length of eighty-seven and a half ft and breadth of the same extent. With 16 pillars, each seven and a half ft high, it is a majestic structure. Even in summer, it is cool inside the mosque. On Fridays, a total of 1,000 people worship here, including in the open area. Close to 150 people break their daily fast during Ramzan in Periya Pallivasal. Next year, the mosque turns 500, and we plan to bring out a book on the history of the mosque,” says Jawahar.","Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/society/56zv21/article24161822.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15FRPANDARAVADAIPERIYAPALLI,"['using', 'plastering', 'mosque', 'ce', 'periya', 'rajendran', 'old', 'pandaravadai', 'pallivasal', 'village', 'm', 'look']",

84,84,FL-2018-000070-BGD,I was a medic who dealt with the casualties at Grenfell Tower. What I saw will stay with me forever - The Independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/grenfell-tower-fire-medic-one-year-kensington-survivors-a8398436.html,"It’s been a year since the Grenfell tragedy and our “Grenfell medics” WhatsApp group still rumbles with messages; of updates from the news or doctors checking up on each other. Those messages are getting more sporadic, but nobody has left – we are bound together by a surreal and unimaginable experience.

Recently there was a spate of messages suffused with anger and shame; some of the team were upset to learn that they had “treated” fraudsters pretending to be victims: “How did we not see the signs?”

Messages of support immediately flood in – “What signs?” – and we all remind each other that we weren’t there to judge or question people in the aftermath of such a calamity; we were there to help, we were there to care. It was that sense of duty, instilled in all of us from the first day of medicine, sworn to abide by on our graduation, which brought us to Grenfell Tower on that fateful night.

I wasn’t even meant to be there. I was on annual leave, resting at home to conserve energy during the 19-hour Ramadan fasts. But like others, as soon as I saw the news of the fire unfolding, something stirred within.

I immediately called the medic contact number to offer my help but the lady reassured me there was enough support, and urged me to stay at home. I have volunteered in Iraq, Lesvos, Calais and Bangladesh, and watching the tragedy unfold in London, my home, I couldn’t sit idly. The next day I packed my medical equipment and attended as a general volunteer, resolving to offer my limbs in service when my stethoscope couldn’t be.

West London was over an hour’s drive away and unfamiliar territory. Roads were cordoned off and we were unsure of the way; it was the unmistakable smell of smoke that oriented us in the end, the remnants of a tragedy that had choked the nation. The sobering Grenfell Tower loomed over us like a tombstone, the atmosphere filled with a sense of foreboding.

After helping to pack and organise items, I happened upon the Red Cross team and asked if they needed any assistance; I was soon ushered into the medical station where a few other GPs had arrived. That night I don’t remember being hungry, or thirsty, or even opening my fast; I just remember the haunting sight of a sports hall filled with rows of empty bedding. Deep inside, I remember suppressing a gnawing realisation that those beds would never be filled.

We did what we could that night: comforted the victims, helped with pain relief, manned the station and tried to organise things for the next few days. We didn’t speak much to each other. The tragedy had drowned out any conversation.

Everything from those first few days was surreal, dream-like; it felt like we had been transported to an apocalyptic film set in West London. All those places I’d worked at abroad were visible in front of my eyes here in London: the buzz of volunteers; the different support groups; the organised chaos; the sense of sombre tragedy that underpinned all activity.

The patients we saw in those days are forever etched in my memory. I can still hear that young man coughing and spluttering, gasping for breath, his lungs poisoned from smoke inhalation. I still recall that patient who I spoke to for almost an hour, who I consoled, agreed a plan for follow-up with and who, on beginning to say goodbye, burst into tears, started shaking widely and collapsed in a fit of panic and fear.

I still remember the young lady who we found wandering in visible shock, dazed, utterly confused and unable to process what had happened.

I still remember the patients where medicines weren’t enough; where words weren’t enough; where tears escaped as we silently embraced.

Weeks on from the tragedy, patients were still attending. They were often displaced victims who had been sofa-surfing but could no longer cope with the screams from the tower that haunted them and would not let them sleep. The tragedy of Grenfell bled into my consultations, its memories punctuated my conversations, its scent interrupted summer barbecues. I found myself replaying those moments on the train to work, or in bed at night; my thoughts with the victims I’d met and the unaccounted souls that I would never meet.

Schwartz Rounds and Balint groups – psychological meetings for doctors who have witnessed traumatic things – helped. I cherished these safe spaces to unburden my emotions to sympathetic ears. But somehow my thoughts always returned to those who had survived the tragedy – how were they coping with such terrifying memories?

On my last shift at the Westway, I remember noticing that the smell of smoke had finally dissipated; it was the remarkable display of humanity and compassion that lingered on. Despite everything I saw, it was this indomitable spirit of selflessness that I remember most fervently. With pride, I recall the amazing response of London to such a tragedy; the response of those who had nothing to give but willingness and compassion; the response of people of all ages, all colours, all religions working hand in hand for a greater cause; the response of some whose stomachs were empty but whose hearts were full.

One year after tragedy struck, it is these memories that persevere above all others, and which I cherish most; memories that mercifully have been untainted by investigations or inquiries or the passage of time. One year on, what do I really remember? How London demonstrated its remarkable human capacity to care for others in need – and that humanity can triumph over tragedy.

Last fall, as hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled Myanmar in the wake of brutal state persecution, soldiers selected 10 men at random from a camp of displaced people and murdered them. Wa Lone and Kyah Soe Oo, reporters from Reuters' Yangon bureau, pieced the story together. Their report recounted the killings in chilling detail, providing an extraordinary glimpse into an ethnic cleansing campaign that has attracted widespread international condemnation. But by the time the story was published in February, the two reporters were in prison, having been arrested that previous December for ""illegally acquiring information with the intention to share it with the foreign media."" Their sentence — 14 years — is longer than those given the murderers that they investigated.

Improved telecommunications and media freedom, rather than help Myanmar move beyond its problems, have instead broadcast them to a wider audience.

Neither ethnic violence nor the persecution of journalists is new to Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation struggling to emerge from decades of poverty, military rule, and isolation. But the story of the two reporters, whom Asia Society honored in absentia last month with the Osborn Elliott Prize for Excellence in Journalism on Asia, encapsulates much about the current state of the country. In the past decade, political and economic reforms — combined with the arrival of widespread internet connectivity — sparked optimism that Myanmar could soon mature into a prosperous democracy with a robust, free media. Instead, global attention has turned to the plight of the Rohingya, a stateless Muslim population whose treatment by Myanmar's military has led to comparisons to genocide. A decade after Myanmar's leaders began tentative steps toward reform, the country now occupies a precarious position, caught between a hopeful future and the resumption of pariah status. Improved telecommunications and media freedom, rather than help Myanmar move beyond its problems, have instead broadcast them to a wider audience.

For decades, Myanmar was one of the world’s most technologically stalled, isolated countries, a resource-rich land governed by a repressive military dictatorship. By the end of 2013, fewer than 13 percent of the Myanmar population had cell phones, while just over one percent had access to the internet — figures akin to North Korea. But the following year, when Myanmar's government awarded Qatar's Ooredoo and Norway's Telenor contracts to build a nationwide cellular network, connectivity accelerated rapidly. The price of a SIM card dropped from around $1,500 to less than $2, and a flood of cheap Android smartphones entered the country. The change has been sudden and drastic: According to Telenor, Myanmar now boasts 105 percent SIM card and 80 percent smartphone penetration.

The sudden telecommunications revolution in Myanmar coincided with a relaxation of censorship, as the country’s ruling generals took steps to liberalize the country. Obtaining a license to operate a media organization became easier, and newspapers, magazines, and television stations no longer had to censor themselves as carefully before publishing investigative journalism. The policy change freed existing news organizations to pursue stories more aggressively and encouraged new players to enter the market.

One company soon became dominant: Facebook. The Menlo Park, Calif., based social network is, for all intents and purposes, the internet in Myanmar: An estimated 85 percent of all web traffic flows through Facebook’s walled garden, and more than a third of Myanmar’s 50 million-plus population receives their news through the site. According to The Washington Post, more people in Myanmar have access to Facebook than they do to electricity.

At first, Facebook’s role in Myanmar’s society seemed to spur, rather than inhibit, democratic change. Local political parties relied on Facebook to coordinate attendance at rallies and to coordinate protests against unpopular government policies. And when Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League of Democracy gained control of Myanmar’s civilian government in historic 2015 elections, the Nobel Peace laureate credited Myanmar’s new connectivity with an assist. ""Everybody gets onto the net and informs everybody else of what is happening,"" she said in an interview with BBC. ""And so it’s much more difficult for those who wish to commit irregularities to get away with it.""

But Facebook’s role as Myanmar’s near-universal media platform did far more than expose government irregularities. It has also spread hate speech and incited violence. Consider Ashin Wirathu, a charismatic Buddhist monk whose antipathy toward the Rohingya population once earned him the moniker ""the Buddhist bin Laden."" For years, Wirathu’s vitriol failed to attract a wide following. But once he established a Facebook page, which he used to spread anti-Rohingya news and propaganda — much of which was untrue — to his hundreds of thousands of followers, Wirathu’s influence spread rapidly. The utility of Facebook did not escape him.

""Social media is much better than using town criers,"" he told Wired. ""If I give a sermon, even people who cannot attend it can hear my message. Now I have thousands of followers.""

The popularity of anti-Rohingya propaganda combined with the frictionless nature of Facebook’s platform meant that legitimate news organizations struggled to gain traction in Myanmar’s marketplace of ideas. Government officials unsympathetic to the Rohingya dismissed media reports of atrocities as ""fake news,"" diluting their capacity to shape readers’ beliefs. In a country without an enduring tradition of a free press, Myanmar’s information sphere became a Facebook-hosted free-for-all.

""You had a society that transitioned so quickly that there weren’t enough watchdogs and hard-hitting journalists who actually knew journalistic ethics,"" said Debra Eisenman, managing director of the Asia Society Policy Institute, and author of ""Reconciling Expectations With Reality in a Transitioning Myanmar,"" a new issue paper on Myanmar. ""People carried the conversation on social media and 'alternative facts' became real violence.""

""People carried the conversation on social media and 'alternative facts' became real violence.""

Facebook’s role in spreading fake news and hate speech in Myanmar has turned into a public relations nightmare for the company. In March, the chairman of the UN Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar blamed Facebook for worsening the country’s violence, telling reporters that the social network had ""substantively contributed to the level of acrimony and dissension and conflict, if you will, within the public,"" and stating that Facebook ""had turned into a beast."" Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, acknowledged regret with how his company was used in Myanmar, while other top executives admitted to ""losing sleep"" over what the technology had wrought there. In 2017, the company withdrew its ""Free Basics"" service, which provides a Facebook-centric internet without data cost to users, in Myanmar. But the damage was done.

Attributing much blame for Myanmar’s situation to Facebook, though, elides the intractable nature of the ethnic conflict in the country, one that has engaged in civil warfare for practically the entire duration of its independence. The military, which is not under the oversight of the civilian government, and is dominated by ethnic Bamar (the ethnic majority in Myanmar), has waged war against nearly two dozen ethnic armed organizations for decades. The Rohingya's own struggles to co-exist with Myanmar's majority are not new. Last year’s mass exodus to Bangladesh was not the first time the Rohingya fled Rakhine State ahead of state violence — similar campaigns occurred in 1978 and 1991. But Myanmar’s isolation — and a lack of modern technology — meant that these instances failed to resonate as much internationally.

The case of the jailed reporters also reveals that the problem for Myanmar’s journalists is less competition from social media but rather something more familiar: repression from the state. Media freedom in Myanmar has certainly improved since the days when the country joined North Korea and Somalia near the bottom of world rankings — but journalists remain subject to arbitrary detention. Reforms aside, insidious forms of censorship remain — particularly with the sensitive issue of the Rohingya. At the Asia Society ceremony honoring the two imprisoned reporters, veteran Myanmar reporter Lawi Weng explained that the country’s government required journalists reporting on the Rohingya to obtain an official quote before they could publish any account of atrocities they encountered in Rakhine. It’s a simple enough request — but one, Weng explained, the government managed to circumvent. ""You’d call morning and night,"" he said, ""but they’d never answer the phone.""

""We created a saint but the saint has become a politician — and we don’t like that.""

Myanmar’s journalists also contend with a majority population largely unsympathetic to the cause of the Rohingya. Many in Myanmar take issue with the idea that the Rohingya are a unique ethnicity at all — rather, they consider them Bengalis who are illegal immigrants. Buddhist monks with Facebook accounts stoke anti-Muslim sentiment to target the Rohingya — but this hardly makes them unique, as anti-Rohingya sentiment is widespread throughout Myanmar society. Caught in between is Aung San Suu Kyi, whose refusal to condemn the treatment of the Rohingya has tarnished her once-pristine international reputation. Suu Kyi’s silence on the issue aligns her with the prevailing sentiment of the much of the population, whom her party has been elected to represent. Kofi Annan, the former U.N. Secretary-General, told The New York Times that “we created a saint but the saint has become a politician — and we don’t like that.”

Expecting that, after six decades of near-total neglect and isolation, Myanmar would transform into a thriving democracy overnight was never realistic. As Eisenman writes in her issue paper, corruption, poor infrastructure, and red tape have deterred investment, and Myanmar citizens often lack sufficient access to credit to launch businesses. The military still exercises considerable control over the country’s political system, reserving 25 percent of all parliamentary seats for itself and exercising management over an array of functions, like tax collection, that might usually come under the jurisdiction of an elected government. In addition to the still-ongoing civil conflicts with ethnic armed organizations on the country’s periphery, Myanmar also suffers from rampant opium production and vulnerability to natural disaster. Placing too much emphasis on Facebook — or the media writ large — oversimplifies the nature of the Myanmar's problems, which result from a complex set of factors that include but are not limited to military atrocities against the Rohingya.

The recent history of Myanmar’s media does, however, succeed as a cautionary tale about the limits of Facebook, and internet technology, to alter fundamental political, social, and economic conditions in a country still climbing out of a decades-long rut. Few can argue that Myanmar was better off when the price of a SIM card equaled seven times the country’s per capita income and Aung San Suu Kyi languished under house arrest. A key, then, is to manage expectations of how quickly Myanmar can realize its potential.

""To aid in the plight of all those in Myanmar, including the Rohingya, we must turn our attention to the country’s myriad interconnected challenges, reconcile expectations with the present reality, address drivers of conflict, and support baby steps toward just and inclusive solutions,"" Eisenman wrote.","Tue, 12 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://asiasociety.org/sites/default/files/styles/1200w/public/2018-06/180611_internet_myanmar.jpg,"['ethnic', 'tell', 'rohingya', 'country', 'society', 'social', 'doesnt', 'media', 'myanmars', 'countrys', 'facebook', 'myanmar', 'does']",

NEW DELHI. Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan (SRK) faced the wrath of trolls on social media after it came to light that one of his cousins, Noor Jahan, is a candidate in the forthcoming general election in Pakistan Here’s how the trolls targeted the actor and why they need to be slayed:Why’s there so much fuss about SRK having a cousin in Pakistan? Prior to partition in 1947, many north Indian families were spread across present day India and Pakistan. Many people currently settled in Punjab and Delhi have their family origins in Pakistan. Going by these trolls’ illogic, all these Indians then are actually Pakistanis, which is ridiculous.Many of us have relatives who live abroad with non-Indian passports, especially in the UK and the US. Does that make us British or American?If SRK’s cousin’s family decided to stay in Pakistan, what does SRK have to do with that decision? He wasn’t even born during partition.Isn’t it obvious that SRK’s father – a freedom fighter himself - chose India over Pakistan? Trolls wilfully – and in shamefully sectarian fashion - ignore that fact and still cast aspersions on SRK’s loyaltiesAnyone who disagrees with these trolls must “move to Pakistan”, according to them. It’s typical of their reductive, bullying rhetoric.This is another ridiculous line of criticism that pops up whenever trolls decide to target SRK for his supposed treachery.Humanitarian acts should not be seen through the lens of nationality. Even the Indian government in the past has donated money for flood relief operations in Bangladesh. Does that make Indian government treacherous?No, it doesn't. Right?Then why single out SRK ? Because he’s in the past said Pakistani players should have been picked for cricket’s Indian Premier League (IPL) and because he worked with a Pakistani actor in a film.As an IPL team owner, SRK has every right to express his opinion. He believed at the time that Pakistan has some of the best T20 format players and that it was a loss to the game not having players from there in the tournament. He had every right to say and believe that as a team owner.As for having acted with a Pakistani star, SRK isn’t the first Bollywood actor to have done so. Besides, he’s an artist, an actor, and he dances to the director’s tune. Aishwarya Rai played opposite actor Martin Henderson in a British film. Does that make her a traitor to India?This troll-attack is downright disgusting and blatantly communal. It doesn’t even deserve the dignity of being slayed.","Mon, 11 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-64538912,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-27080/64538912.jpg","['pakistan', 'cousin', 'rukh', 'contesting', 'trolling', 'reprehensible', 'srks', 'shahrukh', 'srk', 'indian', 'india', 'shah', 'khan', 'pakistani', 'trolls', 'does', 'players', 'actor', 'elections']",

Located in the Chinese capital's Xicheng District, the building is typical of the traditional Siheyuan properties found throughout this neighbourhood.

Siheyuan houses feature a series of connected buildings arranged around a central courtyard. The buildings contain living spaces and bedrooms, with the courtyard used for cooking and cleaning, as well as providing a communal area for the family.

As with many of Beijing's Siheyuan houses, this particular example had become dilapidated and was unfit for contemporary use due to the separation of the various internal spaces.

The project by 0 Architecture aimed to revitalise the building by retaining its timber structure while transforming it into an office that utilises internal spaces more efficiently. The studio now shares the office with an artist.

One of the key interventions is the introduction of a glazed passage connecting the buildings to the south and east of the central courtyard. The area to the south now houses the main office, with the eastern section containing a small conference room.

An additional courtyard created alongside the conference room provides improved natural light within this space, as well as an intimate space for relaxing.

A large skylight incorporated into the ceiling above the conference table enhances the connection with the outdoors by providing a view of the sky and one of three old jujube trees that occupy the site.

The layouts of the office and conference room are defined by a grid of bamboo poles that perform a dual role as part of the supporting structure and a way to integrate built-in furniture including desks and shelves.

""Our design preserves the wooden structure of the roof and the partition wall of the entire house is turned into a large L-shaped space,"" explained 0 Architecture.

""The L-shaped block is divided into 10,000 small blocks,"" the studio added. ""Used space is then subtracted according to functions and people's use habits, and the used space and small pieces of furniture parts are left.""

The bamboo lengths are fixed together using screws to create a grid of boxes, each measuring 28 square centimetres.

Materials including steel plates, wire curtains and glass panels are incorporated into the grid to create surfaces with different functions and varying levels of transparency.

A wooden deck now extends around the perimeter of the gravel-filled courtyard to connect the various rooms. Several of the spaces feature windows or sliding glass doors that can be opened to enhance their connection with the central communal area.

91,91,FL-2018-000070-BGD,The prayer cap and the Islamic fashion industry - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/society/the-prayer-cap-and-the-islamic-fashion-industry/article24101986.ece,"The prayer cap, in all its forms across the globe, is fighting for a share of the spotlight in the growing Islamic fashion industry

Tiruchi resident Nazimul Asif Jeelani has built up a collection of over a 100 prayer caps, that he uses according to occasion. “Getting a new cap was one of the important rites of Ramzan when I was growing up. Wearing one to family and religious functions was expected of all Muslim men in those days,” says Jeelani, an entrepreneur in his 50s. “But nowadays, it doesn’t seem to be very popular, especially among youngsters.”

Jeelani looks up cap sellers on his journeys abroad. “Islamic headgear shops have nearly vanished in India, but in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, where the cap is a part of the official male dress code, you get some very fine products,” he says.

The most cherished part of his collection is a Turkish topi (also known as fez after its Moroccan city of origin) bought by his grandfather when he went on the Haj in 1936. “Though the lining has started to give way, this headgear still has a majestic look to it,” says Jeelani. The vintage item is preserved on its original wooden stand, with a small brush to keep it free of lint.

“A cap really adds panache and dignity to Islamic attire, just like the hat in Western dress,” says Jeelani, adding with a laugh, “It also helps men like me hide their baldness.”

Going global

Thomson-Reuters’ State of the Global Islamic Economy Report 2016-17 estimates Muslim spending on what is marketed as ‘modest clothing’ to reach $368 billion by 2021. But as the global apparel industry continues to mine the rich seam of Islamic fashion, the focus seems to be restricted to women’s clothing.

While there has been a revived interest in hijabs, headscarves and outer garments like abayas and looser-fit clothes, the market seems to be silent on an older piece of Islamic wear — the male prayer cap.

Muslim men are encouraged to use caps to emulate Prophet Muhammad’s practice of covering his hair. At times, the cap is secured with a turban or scarf. In fact, the headdress can also be a good indicator of the wearer’s nationality, because it is invariably adapted to the culture and climate of the place. Often called taaqiya in Arabic, it is also known as topi in South Asian countries.

“Fashion choices, both modest and otherwise, are inevitably more generous to women than to men. They have many options in design, fabric and style, with newer additions every other day. But the choices for Muslim men are limited when it comes to modest wear. The headdress or prayer cap remains, not an old, but a timeless tradition,” says Maaz Mohamed, founder and CEO of Islamicshop.in, an online retailer of Islamic garments and halal (as permitted by Islam) products based out of Chennai.

The cylindrical and tasseled Turkey topi, popularised by the Ottoman Empire’s Sultan Mahmud II, was considered the exclusive mark of the well-dressed Muslim male in pre-Independence India. But a more globally on-trend population is willing to try newer styles now.

Islamicshop.in for example, stocks a wide range of designs like the Kufi, Kashmiri, Turkish, Malaysian, Omani, Karakul and hand woven prayer caps.

On the brink

Bangladesh is the biggest manufacturer of prayer caps in the world, followed by China. Mechanised production has enabled these countries to flood the global markets with their affordable designs, invariably at the cost of handmade caps. Abdul Raheem is reported to be the last cap maker in Thalangara, in Kerala’s Kasargod district, home to the once-famed Thalangara thoppi: a distinctive pure cotton cap with stiff sides, that was a much-sought after item of headgear in the Gulf states.

“One Thalangara thoppi takes 20 days to finish,” says Raheem, whose family has been in the business for over a century.

“From start to finish, at least six people are needed to work on the different stages that involve hand embroidery and machine stitching. I am only making these caps because my late father Abubacker Musalliyar asked me to keep our family tradition going for as long as possible.”

Abdul Raheem has limited his Ramzan orders this year, because of his father’s demise six months ago. In its heyday, the family used to produce 500 Thalangara thoppis per month, mostly for export. Now it’s down to 100. The decline in demand has largely been due to the wider availability of cheap Chinese and Bangladeshi caps.

“When you can get polyester caps for ₹40, who would want to pay ₹150 to ₹250 for a Thalangara thoppi?” asks Raheem. “Over all the labour costs, we get to earn a profit of just ₹10,” he adds. The absence of Government support for this heritage craft has also led to its slow death, says Raheem, adding that he has diversified into other business interests to supplement his income.

Cap sales typically pick up during the month of Ramzan, as Muslim families buy new clothes to celebrate Eid al-Fitr festival. “Ramzan, Eid al-Adha (also known as Bakrid Eid) and Milaad-un-Nabi (the Prophet’s birthday) are generally busy periods for us,” says Sheikh Dawood, proprietor of Surat Caps in Angappa Naicken Street, Chennai. “People don’t just buy caps for themselves, but also to gift friends and employees, along with other items of clothing,” he adds. In the business since 1984, Dawood’s shop also manufactures cloth prayer caps. “Older men, especially those who have returned from Haj or Umrah pilgrimages, tend to wear prayer caps through the day. Youngsters and professionals prefer to put them on only when they head to the mosque or a religious ceremony. The demand in this industry depends on the wearer’s age.”","Thu, 07 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/society/dyffou/article24101983.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7MPCAPABDULRAHEEM,"['caps', 'men', 'islamic', 'thalangara', 'prayer', 'muslim', 'jeelani', 'fashion', 'raheem', 'ramzan', 'industry', 'cap']", 
92,92,FL-2018-000070-BGD,The Robsten saga continues! Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are photographed at a party in L.A. - Yahoo News,https://in.news.yahoo.com/robsten-saga-continues-kristen-stewart-robert-pattinson-photographed-party-l-175444218.html,"The Twilight saga officially ended years ago, but the Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson story continues. Some really grainy new photos apparently show them hanging out again — and needless to say, Twihards have feelings about it.

The exes, who broke up in 2013 after one of the most high-profile celebrity cheating scandals, were snapped outside Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood on Friday. They were both attending Lily-Rose Depp’s 19th birthday party.

These photos aren’t as clear as the ones of Stewart kissing her married Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders (the mega scandal from the summer of 2012). They’re incredibly grainy. But in one photo, you can see K-Stew standing outside as some people approach her.

Another shot shows Rob walking next to the guy wearing the denim top, black pants, and white sneakers, photographed in the first photo.

Then there is this crazy photo, which truly could be of anyone — is that my dad? Aunt Ginny, is that you? — but it purportedly shows the exes standing next to each other outside a few moments later.

Out of focus! Whoever took this shot, which supposedly shows Stewart and Pattinson outside Chateau Marmont on Friday, must have been scrambling to get a glimpse of the pair. (Photo: Backgrid)

And we’ll nip one rumor in the bud. In the second photo, he’s not holding Kristen’s hand. Thank you, Twihard sleuths. It’s a bag … maybe carrying one of his trucker hats for her. (She always used to wear his clothes when they were together. Remember?)

The two met when they were cast as Bella Swan and Edward Cullen in the amazingly popular Twilight franchise. They became an item a year later after she ended a romance. Fast-forward to the summer of 2012 when she was photographed kissing Sanders, who was married to model Liberty Ross, and when she publicly admitted to cheating, issuing an apology to Rob. Just a few months later, however, they worked things out. Well, for a while — they split for good in 2013.

Story continues

Since that time, Rob became engaged to FKA twigs, which the internet had a hard time digesting. The engagement was called off in October. Kristen has primarily been dating women since the split, most recently model Stella Maxwell, since last year, after romances with Alicia Cargile, Stephanie “Soko” Sokolinski, and St. Vincent.

So, if nothing else, here’s to the enduring friendship of Robsten.

93,93,FL-2018-000070-BGD,"Louisiana Insurance Man Rescues Elderly Woman from Kidnapping, Robbery - Insurance Journal",https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southcentral/2018/06/05/491237.htm,"He wouldn’t call himself a hero, but the 83-year-old woman Dennis P. Neyland rescued from a carjack/kidnapping and robbery on the streets of downtown Baton Rouge, Louisiana, probably would.

Neyland, an insurance professional and reserve officer for the Slidell, Louisiana, police department says he was just in the right place at the right time. He credits his training in law enforcement — he was a police officer full-time before he entered the insurance business — for the ability to recognize when something’s amiss.

A regional sales manager for AmTrust North America, Neyland had just left a lunch meeting in Baton Rouge on May 9 with a friend (who’s also in insurance) when he noticed a woman in a late-model maroon Cadillac driving erratically in front of him.

“The lady was stopping and going, and people were passing her. I actually thought she was having a medical emergency,” Neyland said.

He could see that that the driver was elderly. Thinking maybe she had dementia, or was confused or lost, he pulled alongside her. When he did, “the carjacker popped up. I had my Glock out but they couldn’t see it. When I pulled up and said are you okay, [the driver] said ‘no’ and pointed in the back seat. That’s when the carjacker rolls her window “down and says. ‘I’m her caretaker you need to drive on.’ And the old lady says ‘no, she’s not.'”

Neyland keeps his police equipment in his car in case he needs to respond, he said. Grabbing his badge and gun, he told the carjacker to step out of the car. Neyland was wearing his AmTrust dress shirt so he didn’t particularly look like law enforcement officer, but he got out of his car and identified himself as such.

The carjacker stepped out of the car and he told her to wait there until Baton Rouge police arrived. She started to run away. She was wearing a black wig and “when I grabbed her, her hair came off. Then I grabbed her shirt.”

He was calling 911 and explaining it was a “108” — officer needs assistance — when the carjacker twisted out of her shirt. “She was completely nude from the waist up and she came after me to fight. I grabbed her again and she bit me twice. That’s when I put her to the ground and the Baton Rouge police responded. They arrested her,” he said.

A press release from the Baton Rouge Police Department identified the carjacker as Tamikia Raymond, 42. The driver of the vehicle was not named. Raymond was charged with armed robbery, false imprisonment with a dangerous weapon and battery on a police officer.

“They charged her pretty heavy,” Neyland said.

The elderly woman told Neyland after the incident that she had parked her car on the fourth floor of the Belle of Baton Rouge Casino parking garage. She parked there because there were no other cars on that floor. She said Raymond jumped into the backseat of the car, told the driver she had a gun and instructed her to drive to an ATM.

At the ATM the elderly woman withdrew $800 but Raymond saw that the account had a balance of $18,000. So, Raymond told the woman to go to the bank and withdraw the balance or she would kill her.

They were next to a Chase Bank when Neyland stopped them.

While the elderly driver never saw the gun, “it ended up being a BB gun that looked like a real Glock,” Neyland said.

Afterward the driver told Neyland that she was driving erratically on purpose, hoping someone would notice. “She was sharp as a tack,” Neyland said. “… She actually saved herself. … What caught me is she stopped at a green light. … She just stopped and everybody passed her.”

While she was extremely shaken by the incident, the elderly woman didn’t want the officers to call her son or daughter to come get her because, she said, they wouldn’t let her go to the casino anymore.

94,94,FL-2018-000070-BGD,A Whole New Ballgame: Managing Risk for World Champion Houston Astros - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2018/06/15/492258.htm,"Monica Rusch’s work was easier when the Houston Astros were losers.

She was accustomed to worrying about fans being hit by balls, drunks getting too rowdy, players suffering injuries, thieves breaking into parked cars, slips and falls in the stands, even the dreaded prospect of an active shooter at the Astros baseball stadium in downtown Houston.

But now that the team is the World Series Champion, her job is more complicated. Mind you, she’s not complaining. Quite the contrary, Rusch, who has been with the team for 29 years, is thrilled over the team’s success. She refers to her employer as “the 2017 World Series Champions” every chance she gets. “I can’t say that enough. I’m sorry,” she claims.

But it’s just a fact that winning has added to her roster of things to worry about.

Until the Astros’ World Series victory last year, Rusch, senior director of Risk Management for the baseball team, did not have to worry about World Series rings being stolen, fans lined up at 6 a.m. for a 7 p.m. game, or the extreme emotions certain newly-minted celebrity players incite.

Last year also brought a real test of risk management disaster planning, although she can’t pin this one on the team. Before beating the New York Yankees to win the American League Championship and then the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series in October and November, Rusch and her Astros had to beat Hurricane Harvey in August.

“You can observe a lot by watching,” is one of Rusch’s favorite Yogi Berra sayings. She has seen a lot in the venue that not only houses the Astros but also hosts concerts and corporate, charity and other events. But she has not seen anything like 2017.

At this year’s RIMS Conference, Rusch shared her insights into sports and entertainment risks alongside Tamara Bruno, an insurance recovery and advisory attorney from the Houston office of the international law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. Bruno handles complex litigation in energy, high education, hospitality, construction and other industries.

Bruno brought perspectives on insurance for players including disability, loss of value and exposures beyond the baseball diamond from fans, vendors and others.

Bruno contributed another Yogi Berra favorite that she suggested also relates to risk management: “Baseball is 90 percent mental, and the other half is physical.”

Big League Training

From first aid to facility maintenance, crowd control to player behavior, medical privacy to a terrorist attack, Rusch is involved in every facet of safety and security at the home of the Astros, Minute Maid Park.

The stadium has a command center, security cameras, police officers, scanners for people and equipment entering the facility, cleaning crews, and first aid representatives.

Rusch acknowledges the technology tools but talks more about the people and process of risk management—not only the security and safety staff but also the audiences they serve. Much of her job is making sure her people are trained and where they need to be to ensure a safe environment for everyone.

“We plan for every type of risk there is, or we think we know of, but there’s always the unknown. Every time you turn on the radio, the TV … My husband is the worst. ‘Did you hear what the Astros did last night?'” he asks her before she has even had her morning coffee.

Baseball players have spring training; for Rusch, training is all important. As part of it, every employee takes an online course that documents that they have read and understand the policies and procedures.

The security team gets pre-game or event briefings at which they learn what promotions are happening, if there has been a heightened security threat, what the attendance may be, and where there is maintenance going on in the stadium.

There are also post-event briefings. “We want to know what went well, best practices, and lessons learned. No one’s perfect so we want to improve on things,” she said.

The staff training includes a review of Major League Baseball’s code of conduct—including why and when a fan may be ejected.

There is training on golf carts— how to drive them and where to return the keys.

The Astros also have mandatory HIPAA [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)] training on the protection of medical privacy of athletes and employees.

“We have first aid staff that will respond to a situation. We have baseball operations that work with players. The last thing we need is a player’s information to be released if it’s not approved to be released. We want all of our staff to have an understanding of what HIPAA is,” she said.

Risk Scouting

She acts like a team scout.

She anticipates the attendance. “You want to be prepared for the attendance of what goes on, because some things become emotional sometimes. We have a large crowd, our risk factors may go up.”

She monitors response times. “I have first aid strategically placed throughout the ballpark,” Rusch said. She insists that response time be one minute or less. If there is a heavy crowd and it gets congested, she may have to move staff around.

She anticipates the opponent, especially if it’s the in-state rival Texas Rangers. “That is going to be one heck of a game for everybody to come out to. They say it’s bigger in Texas. Yes, those games are bigger because you have your Ranger shirts; you have your Astro shirts,” she said.

Risks of Champions

To demonstrate how her risk lineup has changed (or perhaps it was only an excuse to bring up again that the Astros are 2017 champs), Rusch said she was asked if she had brought her World Series ring to RIMS in San Antonio. Every employee gets one.

“I’m not bringing that from Houston to here,” she exclaimed, suggesting there is added risk from employees showing them off everywhere they go.

She’s worried not only about the flashy rings but also about the players who earned them.

“Some of our players, people didn’t know who they were before. Now you’ve got these success stories of these guys. They’re just terrific people, and everybody wants to get close to them,” she said.

The newfound celebrity status required a re-evaluation of travel and other safety conditions around players.

The major leaguers have a better understanding of the risks of travel than minor leaguers or those new to the big leagues.

“We have multiple minor league teams in different cities. Those cities are different. Usually, they’re in small towns,” she said. “Your major league guys have gone through the minor leagues. They’re much more experienced with the travel.”

They know what’s expected and what the policies are.

Regarding injury risk, it can actually be higher for minor leaguers. The major leaguers contend with wear and tear of having played for years. The younger players, however, are eager to advance.

“Your minor league guys, they want to be the major league guys, so we tend to see more injuries in the minor league system. Some of those can be career ending,” she said.

But the odds of injuries to professional ballplayers pale compared to those for injuries to amateurs—the fans who come to Minute Maid Park for a company or charity function to take batting practice, run the bases and slide into home plate. “I can guarantee you a claim,” she says, adding she always has first aid available, along with signed releases and waivers.

‘Walk in the Park’

One of Rusch’s strategies is what she calls her “walk in the park.”

“Anytime I say, ‘Let’s take a walk in the park’ …. that means bring your notepad, bring your iPad, bring something because I will find something in the ballpark,” she said.

She tells her employees to think of the park as their home: “If you’re assigned to section 252, that’s your home, so you should be responsible for these fans that are coming every time they should be here. They should be comfortable.”

The point of the walk around Minute Maid is to identify anything risky and fix it. They check the concrete, the signage, the striking on the steps. “We check the seats. There might be a bolt missing. We want to know before that person sits in it and has an injury,” she added.

Hurricane Harvey

Last August was no walk in the park—in fact, the park was closed for a period due to Hurricane Harvey. The park was unsafe and unapproachable. But that was the least of the region’s problems. The fans were too busy saving their families, homes and belongings to worry about America’s pastime.

Rusch was among those in danger.

“I am a risk person. I have my backpack packed. I had one bottle of wine, a can opener, a can of tuna, a pack of crackers. I was ready to go. A change of clothes,” she recalled.

Her husband maintained they were not going to have to leave their house.

Then, at 7:00 a.m., there was a knock on their door. They were told, “We’re opening up the reservoir. There could be 100 feet of water here.”

Within 30 minutes, Rusch and her husband were taken out by boat. “That’s how fast it came up,” she said.

She wasn’t able to take her backpack but she did manage to save the company’s laptop.

“I don’t know why,” said the veteran risk manager.

The Astros have an emergency action plan for everything from hurricanes to flood and power failure, plans that anticipate worst case scenarios. She remembers one of the first times they tested the hurricane plan.

“First time there was a warning. They went into action. They knew how long it took to get the equipment off the field, how long it took to close up the facility, get all the supplies that they needed. When the hurricane didn’t happen, they were like, ‘We did this for nothing.’ No, we didn’t, because we have our timeline. We’re prepared to go the next time.”

The Astros played a home series against the Texas Rangers at the stadium of the Tampa Bay Rays due to the devastation in the city as a result of Hurricane Harvey. Hoping to introduce a sense of normalcy to a city devastated by the storm, the Astros returned to Minute Maid Park just a week after Harvey hit for their next series against the New York Mets, even though the city and fans were very much still in recovery mode.

Rusch said she can’t even remember the exact date in August when everything happened. (It was Aug 28 when the reservoir was opened.) “We weren’t allowed to go back until September 15. Geez, that wasn’t on my plan,” she said.

Her experience with Harvey reinforced a lesson she has repeated over and over again throughout her career: “It doesn’t matter how much you prepare, there’s still going to be unexpected things.”

Unexpected things such as when the gates to the reservoir were opened, flooding her neighborhood. Or loss of power. Or loss of access and egress to the stadium.

“Think outside of the box. When you’re putting your plans together, think long term,” she said.

The Astros staff learned an important lesson this year involving the World Series rings when it promoted a replica World Series ring giveaway at a game. The game started at 7 p.m. The first fans were in line at 6:00 a.m. Rusch and her staff had not prepared for the early arrivals. Knowing firsthand about Houston heat and humidity and the risks to people waiting outside in line for all day, they sprang into action.

“I was the first one to shoot the email out, and everybody was waiting for it,” she recalls. The first thing was to get plenty of water outside by the gate for those in line. Next, security was put in place. Then first aid staff was called in.

“Everything went smoothly. Now we’re getting ready for another replica giveaway day,” she said, then adding, unable to help herself, “Want to buy tickets?”

Just Say No

Over the years, she has learned that it takes a thick skin to be a risk manager because she is often the one pointing out why something can’t be done. “A lot of our employees are like, ‘Here she is again. She’s going to say no,'” is how she describes her reputation.

She’s working on altering her image. When some interns wanted to have an event where participants would repel off the roof, Rusch’s boss, the head of operations, told the group not to expect approval. “This isn’t going to float. I know her too well. I’m not going to be the bad guy. She’s going to tell y’all no, so be prepared,” he told them.

She surprised them all by approving the repelling event — but not before turning it into a lesson about risk transfer. She told them to find a way to reduce the risk to the stadium. So they found a vendor that specializes in these events and had them sign agreements to indemnify the Astros organization for everything. “They were so excited about this event, and I couldn’t believe the number of people,” she said, admitting that she was a bit nervous that they might cut the cords when her turn came.

Even at the risk of a reputation for saying no, Rusch stands by her insistence on policies that are clearly written and consistently communicated.

“Written policies are put in place for a reason. It’s about communication and the understanding,” she said. “You have to educate your employees. You have to educate your players. You have to educate everyone so that they can’t come back and say, ‘Well, I didn’t know.'”

Getting everyone on the same page is one way to “reduce or mitigate potential claims,” she said.

“What makes it nice about written policies is that if somebody’s in violation of something, you already know what the recourse is,” she said. “Instead of trying to fix things after the fact.”

Clear policies help create a culture that allows an organization to address behavior early rather than after it escalates. “It’s knowing your audience, it’s knowing your philosophy, and communicating those so everybody knows what the expectations are.”

Written policies are helpful in cases of on-the-field or off-the-field behavior, including drug abuse or domestic violence situations.

“This is something from a risk aspect that I never saw coming,” Rusch admitted, referring to domestic abuse concerns. The Astros now require all players and all staff to go through domestic violence training. She said it has been an “eye-opener” to observe the changes in how people are treating and talking with each other.

“There are words that shouldn’t be in the workplace and probably shouldn’t be in the home,” said Rusch. “Those are things that we’re teaching our employees, our players.”

A final piece of advice: “The one thing I have learned over the years is to listen. You have to listen to your crowd, you have to listen to your audience, you have to listen to your employees and your frontline people.”

One of the newest safety additions in the park is increased netting to block balls and bats from flying into the stands. She has listened to the arguments.

“We get complaints on both sides. ‘You’re not protecting the fans because the netting doesn’t go far enough.’ Then, you get the complaint of, ‘I brought my glove. I’ll never catch a ball.’ It’s both sides, and you have to find that happy medium.”

Rusch even listens to fans who have had a bad experience at the ballpark. She personally calls everyone who has been hit by a ball or a bat. “I think it protects our branding, and I want to be able to reach out to that fan. Every single fan, employee, and player is important to us,” she said.

CIKHA, Myanmar: Breathless, fevered and without the extra oxygen that could help keep them alive, the new coronavirus patients at a hospital near Myanmar’s border with India highlight the threat to a health system near collapse since February’s coup.

To help her tend the seven COVID-19 patients at Cikha hospital, day and night, chief nurse Lun Za En has a lab technician and a pharmacist’s assistant.

Mostly, they offer kind words and paracetamol.

“We don’t have enough oxygen, enough medical equipment, enough electricity, enough doctors or enough ambulances,” Lun Za En, 45, told Reuters from the town of just over 10,000. “We are operating with three staff instead of 11.”

Myanmar’s anti-COVID campaign foundered along with the rest of the health system after the military seized power on Feb. 1 and overthrew elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose government had stepped up testing, quarantine and treatment.

Services at public hospitals collapsed after many doctors and nurses joined strikes in a Civil Disobedience Movement in the forefront of opposition to military rule — and sometimes on the frontline of protests that have been bloodily suppressed.

Thirteen medics have been killed, according to World Health Organization data that shows 179 attacks on health workers, facilities and transport — nearly half of all such attacks recorded worldwide this year, said WHO Myanmar representative Stephan Paul Jost.

Some 150 health workers have been arrested. Hundreds more doctors and nurses are wanted on incitement charges.

Neither a junta spokesman nor the health ministry responded to requests for comment. The junta, which initially set fighting the pandemic as one of its priorities, has repeatedly urged medics to return to work. Few have responded.

Testing collapsed

A worker at one COVID-19 quarantine center in Myanmar’s commercial capital, Yangon, said all the specialist health workers there had joined the Civil Disobedience Movement.

“Then again, we don’t receive new patients any more as COVID test centers don’t have staff to test,” said the worker, who declined to give his name for fear of retribution.

In the week before the coup, COVID-19 tests nationally averaged more than 17,000 a day. That had fallen below 1,200 a day in the seven days through Wednesday.

Myanmar has reported more than 3,200 COVID-19 deaths from over 140,000 cases, although the slump in testing has raised doubts over data that shows new cases and deaths have largely plateaued since the coup.

Now, a health system in crisis is raising concerns about the likely impact on the country from the wave of infections with variants that is sweeping through India, Thailand and other neighbors.

Patients with COVID-19 symptoms started showing up at Cikha hospital in mid-May. It is only 6 km (four miles) from India, and health workers fear the illness could be the highly infectious B.1.617.2 strain — though they lack the means to test for it.

“It’s very concerning that COVID-19 testing, treatment and vaccinations are extremely limited in Myanmar as more lives are at risk with new, more dangerous variants spreading,” said Luis Sfeir-Younis, Myanmar COVID-19 operations manager for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

Surge of cases

Twenty-four cases have been identified in Cikha, said Lun Za En. Seven were so serious they needed hospitalization — a sign of how few cases had likely been detected.

Stay-at-home orders have now been declared in parts of Chin state, where Cikha is located, and neighboring Sagaing region.

The WHO said it was trying to reach authorities and other groups in the area who could provide help, while recognizing the difficulties in a health system that was precipitously reversing years of impressive gains.

“It is not clear how this will be resolved, unless there is a resolution at the political level addressing the political conflict,” said Jost.

Lun Za En said her hospital was doing the best it could with nebulizers — machines that turn liquid to mist — to relieve breathlessness. Some patients have oxygen concentrators, but they only work for the two hours a day that the town gets electricity.

Refusing to abandon the sick, Lun Za En said she decided not to join the strikes.

“The junta will not take care of our patients,” she said.

Across Myanmar, some striking doctors have set up underground clinics to help patients. When Myanmar Red Cross volunteers established three clinics in Yangon neighborhoods, they quickly had dozens of patients.

At best, such options can provide basic care.

“Eighty percent of the hospitals are public health hospitals,” said Marjan Besuijen, head of mission for the Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) aid group. “As MSF or others we can’t step in, it’s too big.”

Although military hospitals have been opened to the public, many people fear them or refuse to go on principle — including for coronavirus vaccinations in a campaign the ousted government had launched days before the coup.

“I am very worried that these new infections will spread all over the country,” said Lun Za En. “If the infection spreads to the crowded cities, it could be uncontrollable.” (Reporting by Reuters staff; Writing by Matthew Tostevin; Editing by Richard Pullin and William Mallard)","Fri, 08 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/2018/06/08/1215196-1821324035.jpg,"['tells', 'hospitals', 'threat', 'afrikaners', 'land', 'workers', 'health', 'covid19', 'white', 'za', 'africas', 'system', 'en', 'patients', 'south', 'ramaphosa', 'reform', 'myanmar', 'lun']", 
96,96,FL-2018-000070-BGD,MGA Volante Obtains US$900M in Capacity to Support 9 Global Underwriting Teams - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2018/06/14/492110.htm,"Volante Global Ltd., the new international managing general agent (MGA) platform, has successfully secured a US$900 million gross premium, multi-class, multi-territory “A+” capacity treaty agreement.

The capacity will support nine new underwriting teams which will work across seven classes of business and operate in North America, Europe and Africa.

The business lines include: property, general liability, space, international motor, facultative P/C, leisure & sport, financial institutions, North America auto and professional indemnity. The teams are scheduled to launch on the Volante platform in Q3 and Q4 2018.

Led by Talbir Bains, founder and CEO of Volante, the group originally secured equity investment in October 2017 from Nephila Capital, which is an insurance-linked securities and reinsurance-linked investments manager. In December 2017, Volante announced its plan to launch in early 2018.

The $900 million capacity was provided by a panel of three A.M. Best and Standard & Poor’s “A+” rated insurers. The single agreement is secured on a multi-year, long-term-agreement (LTA) basis with zero arbitrage fixed commissions. Volante said its earnings will be fully contingent on profit commission, which is in turn a calculation based on carrier performance over the period of the agreement.

The agreement between Volante and the carrier panel is underpinned by Volante’s “pioneering technology platform which ensures full transparency and connectivity,” said the company, explaining that the system’s web-based portals provide the three capacity-providing carriers with real-time management information across all seen, quoted and bound business spanning policies, claims, risk management and rating adequacy.

The transaction delivers “a back-to-basics approach to the MGA-carrier relationship,” said Bains.

“We have embedded within the commission structure of this deal a contractual alignment which necessitates that the underwriting profitability of our carriers is Volante’s primary focus in all aspects of the underwriting journey. This is about building a partnership predicated on complete alignment to the combined operating result of our capacity providers,” he added.

“Our commitment is to become an extension of their own business, operating with all of the guidelines, processes and controls you would expect from a market-leading insurance company – and with our superior technology advantage at the origin of the business, delivering margin optimization through both operational efficiency and enhanced data and pricing analytics,” Bains affirmed.

The capacity transaction was completed over a five-month period with the support of the Global Portfolio Broking team within Aon’s Reinsurance Solutions business, led by UK CEO Nick Frankland, Robert Sharp, Glyn Ridpath, Andrew Matson and Vijay Mavani.

“We are delighted to have played a role in building this unique partnership structure between Volante and its providers, which we believe sets a new standard for the multi-class MGA model,” said Frankland. “By combining world-class capacity, leading sector expertise and technology that enables business to be analyzed and transacted quickly and efficiently, we feel that Volante is well-positioned to be a huge success.”

There are two underwriting teams already secured on the Volante platform with “AA+” capacity on a multi-year agreement: Bridge Underwriting, a Stockholm-based specialist underwriting team operating across multiple P/C lines, and Edison Motor, a London market-based team offering specialist commercial motor insurance products in the UK. A third team, Horizon, which is a treaty reinsurance team based in Zurich, is scheduled to begin underwriting on the Volante platform in January 2019.

97,97,FL-2018-000070-BGD,5 Key Features of 401(k) Plans - Nasdaq,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-key-features-401k-plans-2018-06-06,"By Paul R. Ruedi, CFP®

Most people are typically introduced to a 401(k) plan, a mysterious combination of numbers and letters, when their employer hands them an employee benefit sheet. There may be little to no explanation of their options, and they are then left to make important investing and retirement planning choices. This may be done with absolutely no financial education or background on the decisions being made.

If you are just now learning that you need to pay attention to your 401)k) plan, consider whether or not you know how much you are contributing, whether or not you are getting your full employer match (if your company offers that benefit) and if you know how much of your money is being invested. It's not uncommon if you can't answer all of these questions or have made mistakes in your 401(k) plan. Our educational system does not provide any background information on 401(k) plans. (For more, see: The Basics of a 401(k) Retirement Plan.)

To help you decode it, here is a simple explanation of five important features of a 401(k) plan that employees need to be aware of:

1. Employee Contribution

The employee contribution to your 401(k) is the amount you personally are contributing to the 401(k) plan. You are given the option of how much you would like to contribute, usually as a percentage of your income, and that amount is automatically deducted from you paycheck and placed in your 401(k) account. It is important to be aware of how much you are contributing for many reasons, the most important of which is to make sure you are contributing enough to take advantage of an employer match.

2. Employer Contribution and Matching

The employer contribution is how much your employer is contributing to the plan on your behalf. Some employers automatically contribute a certain percentage of their employees’ income, while others offer to “match” employee contributions up to a certain amount to incentivize people to save for retirement. There are different types of matching schemes. Some will match “dollar for dollar,” so if you put in 3%, your employer puts in 3%. Others will match a percentage of contributions. For example, if your employer matches 50% and you contribute 6% of your salary, your employer will contribute 3% of your salary. I strongly recommend people contribute enough to their 401(k) plans to maximize the employer match.

3. Vesting

An important feature of employer contributions is the vesting period. Vesting is a term for how fast ownership of the contributions your employer made transfer to you, the employee. Many employers designate their contributions to 401(k) plans as 100% vested immediately - the employee owns them right away and if for some reason the employee changes jobs or needs to move money from that plan, the money is 100% theirs.

But sometimes in order to incentive employees to stick around, companies will have their contributions vest over a period of time. This will often take the form of a graded vesting schedule, where a certain percentage (20% for example) vests each year. Or it may take the form of a “cliff,” where you need to wait a certain number of years to be 100% vested, otherwise you don’t receive any of the employer-made contributions to your 401(k).

4. Investment Options

401(k) plans usually provide you with plenty of options to invest your money. The options depend on the employer but most often include a diverse array of 10 - 20 investment funds covering various asset classes from the highest risk stock funds to the lowest risk bond and money market funds. (For more, see: Understanding 401(k)s and All Their Benefits.)

Do not just select every option or choose from the options randomly. Do your research and use your investment options to build a portfolio that is low-cost, diversified and has the appropriate asset allocation for you as an investor. The plan may provide you with a lot of information, but you may have to do some digging yourself by looking up the names of the investment funds or ticker symbols on google.com or finance.yahoo.com. Most people do not have the expertise to build an investment portfolio that is right for them. Do not be afraid to seek help.

5. Roth vs. Traditional

You will be given the option to designate your contributions to a ""traditional” or Roth 401(k). Traditional 401(k) contributions are pretax - the amount you contribute can be deducted on your income taxes, lowering you tax bill. Contributions then grow tax deferred but when it comes time to withdraw down the road, the withdrawals are taxed at your ordinary income tax rates.

Roth contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Your Roth contributions cannot be deducted from your taxable income, but your contributions grow tax deferred and can ultimately be withdrawn tax free provided you follow all the rules.

Don’t get too caught up analyzing the Roth versus traditional decision and avoid investing altogether while you do. This decision is really a matter of deciding if you want to pay taxes now or later, which is driven by whether your tax rate will be higher or lower in the future than it is now. That involves making some predictions about the future and is not a perfect science, so don’t over analyze this decision and lose sight of the bigger picture.

Understand Options to Maximize Benefits

Investing in a 401(k) is a great first step towards funding your dream retirement. But there are several moving parts that you need to be aware of to make sure you maximize the potential benefits of a 401(k). Simple tweaks like increasing your contribution to maximize your employer match can be made in minutes but can have a huge impact over the course of your life. Do your research, understand how much you and your employer are contributing and how it is being invested. Use your investment options to build a portfolio that is right for you. You will be on your way to your dream retirement. (For related reading, see: Top 10 Mistakes to Avoid on Your 401(k).)

99,99,FL-2018-000070-BGD,Court ruling could mean huge windfall for thousands of reservists - Military Times,https://www.militarytimes.com/pay-benefits/military-pay-center/2018/06/13/court-ruling-could-mean-huge-windfall-for-thousands-of-reservists/,"WASHINGTON — Tens of thousands of military reservists may be eligible for extra vacation or nearly a month’s worth of pay from federal departments due to a recent court ruling concerning their past mobilizations.

The government’s bill for the windfall could stretch into the hundreds of millions of dollars, but few individuals eligible for the extra benefits have thus far pursued them. Advocates think that’s because the ramifications of the court ruling aren’t well known, despite their widespread potential impact.

“Some of the agencies involved with this are going to be facing pretty big bills,” said Anthony Kuhn, managing partner at the law firm Tully Rinckey. “So I don’t expect them to be happy about it or really promoting it.”

At issue are reservists who hold federal jobs and were mobilized to active-duty at any point since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.

These reservists say the Army denied them BAH on deployment. Now they’re suing to get it back. A lawsuit filed by eight reserve officers alleges the Army denied them housing allowances while serving in Germany, forcing repayments of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Under federal law, those civil service employees are eligible for 15 days of paid military leave a year on top of other benefits. Previous lawsuits on that issue resulted in large numbers of reservists receiving extra days off or payouts for unused leave time if they had already left their government jobs.

And federal rules also include provisions for up to 22 additional days of paid leave annually for reservists who are activated in support of contingency operations. Individuals who deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan or other overseas locations in recent years have received those benefits without dispute.

But advocates have argued that reservists activated in support of those overseas operations who remain stateside should still be eligible for the extra leave time.

“Until recently, that issue was narrowly interpreted by federal officials,” Kuhn said. “You had to be sent into a combat zone to be eligible for those extra 22 days. This lawsuit changed that.”

The suit, O’Farrell v. Department of Defense, was finalized earlier this spring when a U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in favor of a broader interpretation of what counts as a contingency mobilization.

The plaintiff, Department of Defense employee Michael O’Farrell Jr., was mobilized as a reservist in 2013 to work at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in California for 162 days.

Because his assignment was connected to contingency operations overseas, the court ruled he was eligible for the 22 extra days of leave, even though Merit Systems Protection Board officials had originally denied the claim.

As a result, tens of thousands of reservists previously denied the additional leave may be able to push federal officials for the vacation time or other compensation. Reservists who work for private-sector businesses or were mobilized under non-contingency orders are not eligible for them.

Kuhn said his firm is doing a public awareness push on the issue, setting up new systems to process what they expect to be a flood of reservists looking into the issue. Even with the reduction in the tempo of military operations in recent years, mobilizations of reservists for a host of active-duty roles remains commonplace.","Wed, 13 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/Wi3YNrPPfEaQuyKL7eLwFpCbVE4=/1200x630/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-mco.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C6HEIWHVHBH3DBV3ZZYEPM64CE.jpg,"['thousands', 'military', 'windfall', 'federal', 'reservists', 'days', 'denied', 'operations', 'court', 'mean', 'ruling', 'leave', 'extra', 'issue', 'huge', 'eligible']",
